Joey A. Brewer, an\r\n\nAfrican American Boston police officer, was charged with the\r\n\n1988 kidnapping and rape of a fifteen-year-old minority woman.\r\n\nDuring the jury impanelment for his state court trial, the\r\n\nprosecutor exercised three rounds of his peremptory challenges,\r\n\nincluding challenges to four black jurors. At the end of these\r\n\nthree rounds, and after the prosecutor had announced himself\r\n\nsatisfied, defense counsel objected on the ground that the\r\n\nprosecution had purposefully sought to eliminate black\r                                                                  jurors.\r\n\nThe judge overruled the objection on the ground that it should\r\n\nhave been made earlier, and thus did not require the\r\n\nprosecution to meet the merits of the objection. When the\r\n\nprosecution struck a fifth black juror the next day, the\r\n\ndefense promptly objected that this peremptory challenge was\r\n\nracially biased. The prosecution presented a nondiscriminatory\r\n\nreason for striking the juror, and the court overruled the\r\n\nobjection on the merits. Brewer was convicted, and the\r\n\nconviction was summarily affirmed on appeal by the\r\n\nMassachusetts Appeals Court. The Massachusetts Supreme\r\n\nJudicial Court declined further review. In November 1993,\r\n\nBrewer filed his petition for habeas review.\r\n\n           Seven years after the state trial, a federal\r\n\ndistrict court issued a writ of habeas corpus, requiring Brewer\r\n\n1.  The terms \"African American\" and \"black\" are used\r\ninterchangeably.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nto be retried or released. The court ruled that Brewer had, on\r\n\nthe numbers, made a prima facie case that he had been denied\r\n\nhis constitutional right to a trial before a jury of his peers,\r\n\nwhich the state no longer had the evidence to rebut, and thus\r\n\nthere was a violation of   Batson v.  Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79\r\n\n(1986). We reverse.\r\n\n                             I.\r\n\n          We recount the factual background in the light most\r\n\nfavorable to the verdict. See \r                                         Stewart v. \r                                                    Coalter, 48 F.3d 610,\r\n\n611 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 153 (1995).\r\n\n          While on duty early in the morning of October 22,\r\n\n1988, Officer Brewer came upon a young woman and her father in\r\n\na parked car in Franklin Park. The prosecution presented\r\n\nevidence that Brewer ordered the father to leave the area, put\r\n\nthe young woman in his police cruiser, drove to another\r\n\nlocation, and raped her. The father had attempted to follow in\r\n\nhis car but could not keep up. After the rape, Brewer drove\r\n\nthe victim home and told her to keep quiet. Instead, she\r\n\nimmediately told her mother and father, who then reported the\r\n\nrape to the police. After being treated at a hospital, the\r\n\nvictim directed police to the scene of the rape. \r\n\n          At the scene, police found half of the girl's school\r\n\nclass schedule on the ground. Police logs also indicated that\r\n\nBrewer had failed to respond to four \"priority calls\" during\r\n\nthe time period in which the girl claimed to have been raped.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nBrewer's story was that he interrupted the father having sexual\r\n\nintercourse with the daughter, ordered the father to leave, and\r\n\nthen took the young woman home. Brewer did not arrest the\r\n\nfather, seek medical attention for the daughter, or file an\r\n\nincident report. \r\n\n          Brewer was charged with kidnapping and rape,\r\n\nviolations of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, SS 26, 22A. Jury\r\n\nimpanelment for Brewer's trial began on December 15, 1989.\r\n\nDuring the general voir dire, after six jurors had been excused\r\n\nfor inability to serve, the trial judge inquired about the race\r\n\nof the victim. The judge expressed concern that neither side\r\n\nhad requested a voir dire on the issue of race, and asked\r\n\nwhether it was an issue in the case. Both the prosecutor and\r\n\nthe defense counsel responded that it was not. The judge then\r\n\ncontinued with the general voir dire. \r\n\n          After excusing five more jurors who were unable to\r\n\nserve, the judge again suspended the proceedings and insisted\r\n\nthat defense counsel ask Brewer himself whether he wanted a\r\n\nvoir dire on racial bias. The court, at Brewer's request, then\r\n\nproceeded with an individual voir dire on racial and ethnic\r\n\nbias after excusing the thirteen remaining jurors who were\r\n\nunable to serve. The judge asked each juror, out of the\r\n\n2.  The court may have been prompted to make such an inquiry by\r\na juror who volunteered during voir dire that he was prejudiced\r\nand that when he saw the defendant and the court mentioned\r\nrape, he had become upset.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\npresence of other jurors, whether they had any bias or\r\n\nprejudice for or against black persons or persons of Hispanic\r\n\norigin.\r\n\n          At the end of the individual voir dire, one juror had\r\n\nbeen excused due to racial bias; fourteen of the remaining\r\n\nprospective jurors were seated in the jury box. The first\r\n\nround of peremptory challenges began with the prosecutor, who\r\n\nasked that six jurors be excused. Defense counsel did not\r\n\nobject to any of the challenges. The clerk then excused those\r\n\nsix jurors. \r\n\n          After six new jurors were seated, a second round of\r\n\nchallenges began. The prosecutor made two more peremptory\r\n\nchallenges. Defense counsel did not object. These two\r\n\nchallenged jurors were excused and then replaced. In the third\r\n\nround, the prosecutor challenged one juror. Again, with no\r\n\nobjection from defense counsel, the challenged juror was\r\n\nexcused and replaced.\r\n\n          Having challenged nine jurors over three rounds, the\r\n\nprosecutor informed the court and defense counsel at side bar\r\n\nthat the Commonwealth stood content. At this point, defense\r\n\ncounsel for the first time objected on race grounds, saying\r\n\nthat four of the nine prospective jurors who had been excused\r\n\nwere black: \"We had a fair representation racially of six and\r\n\nnow we're down to two.\" \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          After initially asking the prosecutor to explain his\r\n\nreasons for making the challenges, the trial court withdrew its\r\n\nrequest and instructed defense counsel that he should raise his\r\n\nobjection to a peremptory challenge \"at the time the challenge\r\n\nis made.\" \r\n\n          Although the defense counsel complained that he had\r\n\nnot seen \"the pattern emerge until it was completed,\" he did\r\n\nnot create a record of the races of the challenged jurors. The\r\n\njudge continued with the impanelment, giving defense counsel\r\n\nthe opportunity to make his own peremptory challenges. Defense\r\n\ncounsel's challenges resulted in the exclusion of fourteen more\r\n\n3.  The relevant colloquy went as follows:\r\nPOMAROLE (prosecutor): The Commonwealth stands content.\r\nTHE COURT: Thank you. Mr. McGee?\r\nMcGEE (defense counsel): At the outset, I'd like to object on\r\nthe record to Mr. Pomarole having taken off four black people\r\nfrom the jury. We had a fair representation racially of six\r\nand now we're down to two.\r\nTHE COURT: Mr. Pomarole --\r\nPOMAROLE: Your honor --\r\nTHE COURT: -- I'm going to ask you give us the reasons for your\r\nchallenges.\r\nPOMAROLE: Your Honor, I'd like to also say at the outset --\r\nyour Honor, I believe I've challenged white people as well as\r\nblack people without respect to gender.\r\nMcGEE: He hasn't responded, judge.\r\nTHE COURT: I know he hasn't yet, sir.\r\nPOMAROLE: I'd have to get my notes, your Honor, with respect\r\nto the people that I've challenged.\r\nTHE COURT: At this point, Mr. McGee, I'm not going to require\r\nMr. Pomarole to give his reasons. But I put you on notice, Mr.\r\nPomarole, that, should this issue arise again, sir, I am going\r\nto ask you to justify your challenge. Mr. McGee, in the future\r\nyou should raise that, sir, at the time the challenge is made. \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\njurors including one man who may have been black,    and the\r\n\nexhaustion of the jury pool. \r\n\n          On the second day of jury selection, after the judge\r\n\nexcused those unable to serve and asked each of the prospective\r\n\njurors about racial bias, the state exercised two peremptory\r\n\nchallenges. One of the challenged jurors was black. Just\r\n\nafter that juror was excused and replaced, Brewer's counsel\r\n\nobjected and then specifically identified the number of the\r\n\nblack juror at the court's request. The court then, consistent\r\n\nwith its prior statement, asked the state to explain why it\r\n\nmade the challenge. The state responded that the juror had two\r\n\nchildren roughly the same age as Brewer and therefore might be\r\n\nsympathetic to him. The court rejected the objection. The\r\n\nimpanelment then continued with defense counsel making the\r\n\nremainder of his challenges, and the court excused three more\r\n\njurors. \r\n\n          In the end, only one African American was on the jury\r\n\npanel. This sole black juror was randomly chosen to be an\r\n\nalternate and did not engage in deliberations. In sum, a total\r\n\nof forty-five potential jurors went through the jury box; seven\r\n\nwere black. There is no evidence as to the total number of\r\n\n4.  There was some dispute between the court and defense\r\ncounsel as to whether this juror was black or Hispanic.\r\n\n5.  These figures are based on four assumptions: that the four\r\njurors challenged by the state on day one of jury selection\r\nwere in fact black, that one of the jurors challenged by the\r\ndefense on day two of jury selection was black, that one juror\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nblack potential jurors. The government exercised eleven\r\n\nperemptory challenges, five of which were against black venire\r\n\nmembers. Brewer used one of his seventeen peremptory\r\n\nchallenges to strike a black potential juror.\r\n\n          Before trial, Brewer filed a motion to dismiss for\r\n\nprosecutorial misconduct, arguing that the state had failed to\r\n\ndisclose material and exculpatory evidence in violation of the\r\n\nrule articulated in  Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\r\n\nBrewer complained that the prosecutor had delayed revealing\r\n\ntest results that were inconclusive as to whether semen found\r\n\nin the victim was in fact Brewer's. At a bench conference on\r\n\nthe first day of trial, the prosecutor had stated that, if\r\n\nBrewer were to introduce evidence that he was not the source of\r\n\nthe semen, the victim would be forced to testify that the\r\n\nsource was her boyfriend, with whom she had had sexual\r\n\nintercourse before the rape. Defense counsel argued that the\r\n\nalleged victim's prior unprotected intercourse with her\r\n\nboyfriend was exculpatory for his client, because it suggested\r\n\nthat she might have a motivation for fabrication. Counsel\r\n\nchallenged by the state on day two was black, and that one\r\nalternate juror was black. The race of one juror who was\r\nexcused during peremptory challenges because of scheduling\r\nproblems is unknown. There is no clear record of the race of\r\nthese jurors.\r\n    The Commonwealth questioned petitioner's assertions about\r\nthe number of African American venirepersons, but not until the\r\nfederal proceedings. This challenge would have been better\r\nreceived if brought during the state proceedings. \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nasked that if the court refused to dismiss the case, that it\r\n\norder the Commonwealth to disclose the boyfriend's identity.\r\n\nThe trial court denied the motion to dismiss and did not order\r\n\ndisclosure of the boyfriend's identity on the ground that the\r\n\nMassachusetts Rape Shield Law prohibits the introduction of a\r\n\nvictim's sexual history. \r\n\n          On the last day of trial, Brewer presented expert\r\n\ntestimony that he was not the source of the semen. He then\r\n\ntestified that when he found the victim and her father in the\r\n\ncar, she was naked and her father's pants were down, thus\r\n\nsuggesting that the father was the source of the semen. The\r\n\nvictim testified on rebuttal that she had had unprotected sex\r\n\nwith her boyfriend suggesting that the semen was his. Defense\r\n\ncounsel objected, saying that he had asked for the boyfriend's\r\n\nname earlier and was now precluded from making a credibility\r\n\nargument. The court declined to revisit the issue. After\r\n\ntrial, Brewer had blood samples from the boyfriend tested. The\r\n\nresults indicated that the boyfriend was not the source of the\r\n\nsemen. Brewer then filed a motion for a new trial based on\r\n\nthis \"newly discovered\" evidence. The motion was denied on the\r\n\nground that the defendant had already presented expert\r\n\ntestimony that he was not the source of the semen.\r\n\n                            II. \r\n\n          Brewer was convicted and sentenced to nine-to-twelve\r\n\nyears' imprisonment for rape and three-to-five years for\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nkidnapping, to be served concurrently. He appealed his\r\n\nconviction to the Massachusetts Appeals Court. Prior to a\r\n\ndecision on appeal, he filed a motion for new trial with the\r\n\ntrial court, arguing,  inter  alia, that the prosecutor had\r\n\nimpermissibly used peremptory challenges based on race. The\r\n\ntrial court denied the motion. \r\n\n          Brewer filed an appeal from the denial of the new\r\n\ntrial motion, which was consolidated with his direct appeal.\r\n\nIn response to Brewer's arguments, the state argued that, by\r\n\nwaiting to object until after all four jurors were dismissed,\r\n\nBrewer had failed to object in a timely fashion to the state's\r\n\ndisputed peremptories. In a one-and-a-half page opinion, the\r\n\nAppeals Court upheld Brewer's conviction: \"Substantially for\r\n\nthose reasons set out in the Commonwealth's brief and the trial\r\n\njudge's memorandum of decision in denying the defendant's\r\n\nmotion for a new trial, we conclude that there is no basis for\r\n\ndisturbing the defendant's convictions.\" \r\n\n          Brewer filed an application for leave to obtain\r\n\nfurther appellate review with the Massachusetts Supreme\r\n\nJudicial Court. The request was denied without opinion.\r\n\n          Brewer petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the\r\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\r\n\nin November 1993. He argued that the prosecution made racially\r\n\nmotivated peremptory challenges, thereby violating his\r\n\nFourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection and due process\r\n\n                            -10-\r                                         10\r\r\n\nof law as established in   Batson v.  Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79\r\n\n(1986). He also renewed his claim that the state had withheld\r\n\nexculpatory evidence in violation of the Brady rule. \r\n\n          The district court denied relief on the \r                                                             Brady claim,\r\n\nbut found that Brewer had made a prima facie case of\r\n\ndiscrimination under Batson. The district court gave plenary\r\n\nreview to the question of racial discrimination and relied\r\n\nsolely on numbers to conclude that a prima facie case was\r\n\nestablished.\r\n\n          Engaging in its own statistical analysis, the\r\n\ndistrict court concluded that there was a pattern that\r\n\ndemonstrated a statistical disparity sufficient to establish\r\n\na prima facie case of racial discrimination under \r                                                             Batson. The\r\n\ndistrict court noted that when Brewer first made a     Batson\r\n\nobjection, the prosecutor had exercised nine peremptories, four\r\n\nof which were used to excuse four out of six black\r\n\nvenirepersons. In doing this, the court found that the\r\n\nprosecutor used 44% of his strikes in the first round to excuse\r\n\n66% of the black persons then impanelled.\r\n\n          There were no statistics available as to the racial\r\n\ncomposition of the venire which had been found to be unbiased\r\n\nafter voir dire or the racial composition of Suffolk County\r\n\nfrom which the venire was drawn. The district court, however,\r\n\nestimated that 15% of the entire venire was black based on the\r\n\nfact that out of a total of 45 potential jurors who had passed\r\n\n                            -11-\r                                         11\r\r\n\nthrough the box, seven were black. Thus, the court reasoned,\r\n\nthe prosecutor's strike rate against blacks in the first round\r\n\n(66%) was several times larger than the population of the\r\n\nblacks in the venire (15%). \r\n\n          Applying the new standard of review outlined in the\r\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L.\r\n\n104-132 (\"AEDPA\"), the court found that the estimated numbers\r\n\nbased on the \"pattern\" of strikes alone constituted a prima\r\n\nfacie case of discrimination under \"clearly established\"\r\n\nSupreme Court law.\r\n\n           The court then ordered an evidentiary hearing to\r\n\nallow the state to offer nondiscriminatory reasons for the\r\n\nchallenges. The state was unable, seven years after the trial,\r\n\nto produce any evidence. The prosecutor said that he could not\r\n\nrecall the reasons and had long since destroyed his trial\r\n\nnotes. The court granted the writ on      Batson grounds on\r\n\nSeptember 30, 1996, but stayed its issuance to allow for an\r\n\nappeal. \r\n\n          Seeking clarification, the state returned to Suffolk\r\n\nCounty Superior Court and filed a request for the original\r\n\ntrial judge to explain her rulings on Brewer's Batson claims.\r\n\nAfter conducting a hearing, the trial judge issued a memorandum\r\n\nstating that she had rejected the initial    Batson claim on\r\n\n6.  In his appellate brief, Brewer agreed, relying upon the\r\ndistrict court opinion, that numbers alone can establish a\r\nprima facie case.\r\n\n                            -12-\r                                         12\r\r\n\ntimeliness grounds. Because the excused potential jurors had\r\n\nalready left the courtroom, she was unable to observe their\r\n\nraces and demeanors at the time of the objection. She was\r\n\ntherefore unable to make a meaningful evaluation of the\r\n\ndefendant's claim that the prosecutor had made race-based\r\n\nperemptory challenges. \r\n\n          Based on this response, the state filed a motion for\r\n\nreconsideration in the federal district court, arguing that\r\n\nhabeas review was barred by procedural default. The court\r\n\nfound the state's new argument unpersuasive and denied the\r\n\nmotion, holding that there was no independent and adequate\r\n\nstate ground. The Commonwealth appeals, arguing,  inter alia,\r\n\nthat the district court erred in concluding that there was no\r\n\nprocedural default on the Batson claim. Additionally, Brewer\r\n\ncontends on appeal that the government's failure to disclose,\r\n\nin a timely fashion, the boyfriend's identity deprived him of\r\n\nthe opportunity to counter the \"boyfriend story\" in violation\r\n\nof his constitutional rights to a fair trial and due process of\r\n\nlaw. \r\n\n7.  Brewer did not, as requested, file an application for a\r\ncertificate of appealability in this court on this issue. Even\r\nif we treat his appellate brief as such an application, it is\r\na close question whether Brewer even meets the standards for a\r\ncertificate of appealability. Because we reject the claim on\r\nits merits, we pretermit this initial question. See \r                                                                Norton v.\r\nMathews, 427 U.S. 524, 530-31 (1976) (where merits can be\r\neasily resolved in favor of the party challenging jurisdiction,\r\nresolution of complex jurisdictional issue may be avoided);\r\nBirbara v. \r                      Locke, 99 F.3d 1233, 1237 (1st Cir. 1996); \r                                                                Caribbean\r\nTransp.

Under that\r\n\ndoctrine, federal courts sitting to hear habeas petitions from\r\n\nstate prisoners are barred from reviewing federal questions\r\n\nwhich the state court declined to hear because the prisoner\r\n\nfailed to meet a state procedural requirement.    Lambrix v.\r\n\nSingletary, 117 S. Ct. 1517 (1997). In such cases, the state\r\n\njudgment is said to rest on independent and adequate state\r\n\nprocedural grounds.   Harris v.

Considerations of\r\n\ncomity and federalism bar the federal court's review. \r                                                                 Lambrix,\r\n\n117 S.

Lambrix,\r\n\n117 S. Ct. at 1523. \r\n\n          There are, however, exceptions to the bar on habeas\r\n\nreview if the prisoner \"can demonstrate cause for the default\r\n\nand actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of\r\n\nfederal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims\r\n\nwill result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\" \r                                                                 Coleman,\r\n\n501 U.S. at 749-50. \r\n\n          Here, although the state did not raise the procedural\r\n\ndefault issue in the federal habeas court until a motion for\r\n\nreconsideration, the district court ruled that it would\r\n\nconsider the procedural default argument on its merits, in the\r\n\ninterests of comity. As the district court properly noted, it\r\n\nhas the authority to consider the procedural default issue \r                                                                      sua\r\n\nsponte.  Ortiz v. Dubois, 19 F.3d 708 (1st Cir. 1994),  cert.\r\n\ndenied, 513 U.S. 1085 (1995); see also Henderson v.  Thieret,\r\n\n859 F.2d 492, 493 (7th Cir. 1988). Although belated, the\r\n\nCommonwealth did make the argument in the state trial court,\r\n\nand the issue was fully briefed both there and here. The\r\n\nprocedural default issue was also squarely presented to the\r\n\nstate appellate courts on direct review. \r\n\n          On the merits of the procedural default argument, the\r\n\ndistrict court held: \"Because the [Massachusetts] Appeals Court\r\n\ngave no plain statement as to its reasons for upholding the\r\n\n                            -15-\r                                         15\r\r\n\nconviction, this Court on habeas corpus review presumes that\r\n\nthere [are] no independent and adequate state grounds barring\r\n\nreview.\" The Commonwealth challenges this finding. We start\r\n\nwith the doctrine of independent and state grounds, focusing\r\n\nfirst on the question of independence.\r\n\nIndependence\r\n\n          Generally, a federal habeas court defers to a state\r\n\ncourt's articulation of a state law ground for a decision.\r\n\nWhen the state decision \"fairly appears to rest primarily on\r\n\nfederal law or to be interwoven with federal law,\" the federal\r\n\ncourt presumes there is no independent and adequate state\r\n\nground for the decision.  Coleman, 501 U.S. at 733 (internal\r\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted). However, that\r\n\npresumption does not apply where, as here, there is no \"clear\r\n\nindication that [the] state court rested its decision on\r\n\nfederal law.\"  Id. at 739-40.\r\n\n8.  There are refinements to that doctrine. If, after deciding\r\na party is procedurally barred from raising a claim, the state\r\ncourt nonetheless reviews the merits for a miscarriage of\r\njustice and discusses federal law in that context, that limited\r\nreview does not undercut the adequacy and independence of the\r\nstate grounds. Burks v. \r                                    Dubois, 55 F.3d 712, 716 n.2 (1st Cir.\r\n1995); Tart v.  Massachusetts, 949 F.2d 490, 496 (1st Cir.\r\n1991).\r\n\n9.  While a broad reading of the Supreme Court's decision in\r\nHarris, 489 U.S. 255, might lead to the conclusion that a\r\npresumption that the state court decision rests on federal\r\ngrounds or on intertwined state and federal ground applies\r\nhere, \r                 Harris was limited by the Court's subsequent decision in\r\nColeman.  See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 735-36. \r\n\n                            -16-\r                                         16\r\r\n\n          The one-and-a-half page summary order of the\r\n\nMassachusetts Appeals Court is the last expression of opinion\r\n\nfrom the state courts.  The final state court word on the\r\n\nmatter refers us to the opinion of the trial court and the\r\n\nCommonwealth's state appellate brief. The state appellate\r\n\ncourt denied the appeal \"substantially for the reasons set\r\n\nforth in the Commonwealth's brief and the trial judge's\r\n\nmemorandum of decision in denying the defendant's motion for a\r\n\nnew trial.\" In   Coleman, the state court likewise issued a\r\n\nsummary order referring to its consideration of all of the\r\n\nfiled papers, including the briefs of the petitioner and the\r\n\nstate. The Supreme Court acknowledged that this language\r\n\nraised some ambiguity because the briefs referred to federal\r\n\nclaims.  Id. at 744. But the Court held that such ambiguity\r\n\ndid not warrant application of a presumption that the state and\r\n\nfederal claims were intertwined.  See id. \r\n\n           The Commonwealth's brief to the Massachusetts\r\n\nAppeals Court argued that the defendant had waived his right to\r\n\nchallenge the first four black jurors by not making his\r\n\nchallenge in a timely fashion. Additionally, it argued on the\r\n\n10.  The Supreme Judicial Court denied Brewer's application for\r\nfurther review without opinion. \r\n\n                            -17-\r                                         17\r\r\n\nmerits that striking the fifth black juror did not violate the\r\n\nConstitution.\r\n\n          The trial court's memorandum of decision on Brewer's\r\n\nnew trial motion was responsive to the arguments presented in\r\n\nthe motion, which rested \"primarily on the grounds of newly\r\n\ndiscovered evidence.\" Brewer presented only a generalized\r\n\nargument about the exclusion of blacks from the jury in his\r\n\nmotion: \"Due to challenges from the prosecution, most black\r\n\njurors were excluded from the jury and none deliberated on the\r\n\nverdict.\" Brewer's motion did not, on its face, challenge the\r\n\nearlier ruling that Brewer's objection to the prosecution's\r\n\nexercise of peremptories to strike four black venire members\r\n\nwas untimely. The order of the state judge denying the new\r\n\ntrial motion may appear at first to be somewhat ambiguous\r\n\nbecause it starts with a statement that the court found no\r\n\nsupport for the contention that the Commonwealth had improperly\r\n\nexcluded blacks from the jury. However, the part of the state\r\n\n11.  The state's brief argued as follows:\r\n\n          The defendant waived his right with\r\n          respect to the four challenged black\r\n          jurors because he did not object after\r\n          each challenge, did not make an offer of\r\n          proof, did not raise the matter until\r\n          after the four jurors were excused and\r\n          left, did not request a hearing and did\r\n          not say anything at all when addressed by\r\n          the judge, told that she was not going to\r\n          ask the prosecutor for reasons and given a\r\n          chance to reply.\r\n\n                            -18-\r                                         18\r\r\n\ncourt opinion dealing with the jury selection procedures only\r\n\nconcerns the challenge by the prosecution of the fifth black\r\n\njuror. There is no discussion of defendant's earlier\r\n\nobjection. In his application for leave to obtain further\r\n\nappellate review from the Supreme Judicial Court, Brewer\r\n\nadmitted that there was no discussion of the legality of the\r\n\nexclusion of the four prospective jurors in the trial judge's\r\n\nmemorandum addressing the new trial motion.\r\n\n          There is certainly reason to believe that the basis\r\n\nfor the ruling as to the timing of the objection to the\r\n\nprosecutor's first four peremptories against black jurors was\r\n\nan independent state procedural ground.   As a result, we\r\n\nconsider the state's argument that the state appeals court\r\n\nruling rested on the grounds that the challenge to the\r\n\nexclusion of the first four jurors was not timely made and that\r\n\n12.  When the Commonwealth sought clarification in 1996, the\r\njudge who presided over Brewer's state court trial emphasized\r\nthat her ruling on the objection was a result of the timing of\r\ndefense counsel's objection. \r\n          As the court stated to defendant's\r\n          counsel: \"[y]ou should raise that at the\r\n          time  \r                           the  \r                                challenge  \r                                          is  \r                                              made.\" Tr.1-124\r\n          (emphasis added). Because the court was\r\n          foreclosed from effectively assessing the\r\n          challenges and could not ascertain whether\r\n          the reasons were race neutral, the court\r\n          withdrew its request to have the\r\n          Commonwealth explain its challenges. The\r\n          defendant's claim was rejected on\r\n          timeliness grounds.\r\n\n                            -19-\r                                         19\r\r\n\nthe challenge to the fifth black juror was valid under the\r\n\nBatson standard.  \r\n\nAdequacy\r\n\n          The \"adequacy\" of this state procedural ground, for\r\n\nfederal habeas purposes, is another issue.     Batson itself\r\n\ndeclined to decide when an objection must be made in order to\r\n\nbe timely and left that matter to be resolved by local law.\r\n\nBatson, 476 U.S. at 99-100 &amp; n.24. There are no Massachusetts\r\n\nSupreme Judicial Court cases establishing precisely when in the\r\n\nsequence of events an objection to a peremptory challenge must\r\n\nbe made. \r\n\n          Brewer's challenge rests largely on the ground that\r\n\nstate procedural requirements \"cannot be permitted to thwart\r\n\nreview applied for by those who, in justified reliance on prior\r\n\ndecisions, seek vindication in state courts of their federal\r\n\nconstitutional rights.\" NAACP v. \r                                            Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 457-58\r\n\n(1958). State rules may not procedurally bar a federal court\r\n\nfrom hearing a Batson claim on timeliness grounds if the rule\r\n\nis not \"firmly established and regularly followed.\"  Ford v.\r\n\nGeorgia, 498 U.S. 411, 423 (1991). In Ford, the Supreme Court\r\n\ndeclined to honor a procedural bar where the defense counsel\r\n\nhad in fact raised the \r                                  Batson issue prior to jury selection. \r\n\n13.  It is not necessary that a state court explicitly state\r\nthat it is resting its decision on state procedural grounds in\r\norder for the decision to be deemed to rest on \"independent and\r\nadequate state grounds.\"  See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 735-36. \r\n\n                            -20-\r                                         20\r\r\n\n          Ford made clear that state procedures may not\r\n\ncompletely preclude the very opportunity to raise\r\n\nconstitutional claims.  See also James v. Kentucky, 466 U.S.\r\n\n341, 348-52 (1984); Michel v.  Louisiana, 350 U.S. 91, 93-94\r\n\n(1955); cf.  Powell v.  Nevada, 511 U.S. 79, 83-84 (1994).\r\n\nBrewer argues that requiring a defendant to object to a\r\n\nchallenge on the ground of a pattern of racially exclusionary\r\n\nstrikes before the pattern emerges raises constitutional\r\n\nissues. For example, he says he should not have had to object\r\n\nto the strike of the first black juror on the ground of a\r\n\npattern of racial discrimination if he did not see the pattern\r\n\nuntil the strike of the fourth black juror. If that were what\r\n\nhappened in this case, we would have considerable sympathy for\r\n\nthe argument. But that is not what happened. As the state\r\n\ntrial court said in its clarification memo, any pattern emerged\r\n\nat the latest with the strike of the fourth juror; the defense\r\n\nshould have made its objection at that time rather than waiting\r\n\nuntil later:\r\n\n          The defendant's counsel could have raised\r\n          the issue of impermissible peremptories\r\n          after the Commonwealth indicated a desire\r\n          at side bar to excuse the first six\r\n          jurors, or the next two jurors, or the\r\n          final juror, and before those jurors were\r\n          excused but not after the Commonwealth\r\n          said it was content.\r\n\nThere is no constitutional impediment to a state procedural\r\n\nruling such as the trial judge stated.\r\n\n                            -21-\r                                         21\r\r\n\n          Even if there is no constitutional impediment to the\r\n\nstate procedural rule, the Supreme Court has said that the rule\r\n\nmust be \"firmly established and regularly followed.\" \r                                                                Ford, 498\r\n\nU.S. at 423. The Commonwealth relies on Massachusetts' firmly\r\n\nentrenched contemporaneous objection rule.   Commonwealth v.\r\n\nFluker, 385 N.E.2d 256, 261 (Mass. 1979). In cases where\r\n\ndefense counsel fails to make a timely objection, the state\r\n\ndoes not waive the objection, and the appellate decision rested\r\n\non that ground, that is \"a classic example of a procedural\r\n\ndefault, and petitioner can succeed in his habeas case only by\r\n\nshowing cognizable cause for, and cognizable prejudice from,\r\n\nhis procedural default or, alternatively, by demonstrating that\r\n\nthe federal court's failure to address the claim on habeas\r\n\nreview will occasion a miscarriage of justice.\"     Burks v.\r\n\nDubois, 55 F.3d 712, 716 (1st Cir. 1995) (failure to object to\r\n\nprosecutor's misstatement of evidence at closing precludes\r\n\nhabeas review); see also Puleio v. Vose, 830 F.2d 1197, 1199\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1987).\r\n\n          Recognizing the value of contemporaneous objections,\r\n\nthis court has itself rejected review of Batson claims where\r\n\ndefense counsel failed to make timely and adequate objection at\r\n\ntrial. In  United \r                               States v. Pulgarin, 955 F.2d l (1st Cir.\r\n\n1992), we rejected direct review where the defense counsel had\r\n\nmade an aborted attempt at trial to raise a    Batson claim,\r\n\nsaying:\r\n\n                            -22-\r                                         22\r\r\n\n          [C]ontemporaneous objection is especially\r\n          pertinent as to    Batson claims, where\r\n          innocent oversight can so readily be\r\n          remedied and an accurate record of the\r\n          racial composition is crucial on appeal.\r\n\nPulgarin, 955 F.2d at 1. Important institutional concerns are\r\n\nadvanced by enforcing the contemporaneous objection rule for\r\n\nBatson claims.\r\n\n          The Commonwealth's common law contemporaneous\r\n\nobjection rule has a statutory analogue in Rule 22 of the\r\n\nMassachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, which requires that\r\n\nan objection be made at the time of the challenged action.\r\n\n14.  We note that there may be tactical reasons why counsel may\r\nchoose to wait before asserting an objection to the other\r\nside's peremptory challenge. A party may want a particular\r\nblack juror challenged by the other side to be excused for his\r\nown reasons, but still to claim racial bias. Because the court\r\non a promptly made objection to a challenge may choose, after\r\nexamination, to seat the juror if the juror is still available,\r\na belated objection made after the juror has left may narrow\r\nthe range of remedies available to the court. Commonwealth v.\r\nReid, 424 N.E.2d 495, 500 (Mass. 1981) (trial judge has\r\ndiscretion to fashion remedy, including disallowing challenge,\r\nand is not required to dismiss the entire venire). If the\r\njuror is no longer physically present, the court's remedial\r\noptions may then be limited to a mistrial and impanelling a new\r\njury. Enforcement of the contemporaneous objection rule avoids\r\nallowing a late-objecting party to have his cake and eat it\r\ntoo.\r\n\n15.  Mass. R. Crim. P. 22 provides:\r\n\n          [I]t is sufficient that a party, at the\r\n          time the ruling or order of the court is\r\n          made or sought, makes known to the court\r\n          the action which he desires the court to\r\n          take or his objection to the action of the\r\n          court, but if a party has no opportunity\r\n          to object to a ruling or order, the\r\n          absence of an objection does not\r\n          thereafter prejudice him. \r\n\n                            -23-\r                                         23\r\r\n\nThe purpose of the objection requirement of Rule 22 is to\r\n\nensure that the alleged error is \"brought clearly to the\r\n\njudge's attention so that [s]he may squarely consider and\r\n\ndecide the question.\"  Commonwealth v. Mosby, 413 N.E.2d 754,\r\n\n762 n.4 (Mass. App. Ct. 1980).\r\n\n          As she stated in her clarification memorandum, the\r\n\nstate trial judge felt hampered in her ability to fairly\r\n\nevaluate the objection to the peremptory challenges by the\r\n\ntiming and method of the objection. Defense counsel did not\r\n\nrefer to the four jurors in question by their juror numbers or\r\n\nother identification, but only said that they were black. At\r\n\nthe time of the objection, those jurors had already been\r\n\nexcused and had left the courtroom. There is no indication\r\n\n(because defense counsel created no record) of where in the\r\n\nsequence of the prosecutor's nine peremptory challenges these\r\n\nfour fell or whether the court or counsel had a clear memory of\r\n\nwho those jurors were. Nor did counsel create a record of the\r\n\nrace of the jurors. As the trial judge said, working later\r\n\nfrom her memory:\r\n\n          The race or ethnicity of the jurors cannot\r\n          be definitely known. As defendant's\r\n          counsel stated during impanelment \"I have\r\n          no way to distinguish between Hispanic and\r\n          black.\" Tr. 1-125. The court does recall\r\n          that there were discussions with counsel,\r\n          on and off the record, concerning the race\r\n\n                            -24-\r                                         24\r\r\n\n          and ethnicity of various members of the\r\n          venire.\r\n\nThe trial judge commented that the lateness of counsel's\r\n\nobjection -- after all the jurors at issue had left -- meant\r\n\nthat she had \"no opportunity to observe the demeanor or\r\n\nappearance or race of the excused jurors or to evaluate\r\n\nmeaningfully the Commonwealth's challenges.\"  See also United\r\n\nStates v. Bergodere, 40 F.3d 512, 517 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          At this general level, there is support for the\r\n\nCommonwealth's argument that this case involves an application\r\n\nof the contemporaneous objection rule. Even before    Batson,\r\n\nMassachusetts, acting under its own Constitution, prohibited\r\n\nthe racial use of peremptory challenges in 1979.          See\r\n\nCommonwealth v.   Soares, 387 N.E.2d 499 (Mass. 1979).\r\n\nSubsequent cases made it clear that \r                                              Soares challenges had to be\r\n\nmade at a time sufficient to \"provide[] the trial judge and\r\n\nopposing counsel with an opportunity to address the matter.\r\n\nThis, in turn . . . created a record which was adequate for\r\n\nappellate review.\" Commonwealth v. \r                                              Bourgeois, 465 N.E.2d 1180,\r\n\n1186 n.11 (Mass. 1984); cf. Commonwealth v. Smith, 532 N.E.2d\r\n\n1207, 1209 (Mass. 1989).  Bourgeois made the record creation\r\n\n16.  Our assumption, \r                                arguendo, in light of the state's failure\r\nto raise it as an issue until late, that seven of the jurors\r\nwere black does not affect the trial judge's view at the time\r\nthat there was some dispute as to the racial identity of the\r\njurors and that she would have been assisted on this topic of\r\nracial identification had the objection been promptly made.\r\n\n                            -25-\r                                         25\r\r\n\nexpectation explicit: \"A record in which [the prosecution] has\r\n\nnot had an opportunity to explain the use of peremptory\r\n\nchallenges is inadequate to raise a       Soares violation.\"\r\n\nBourgeois, 465 N.E.2d at 1186; \r                                          see \r                                              also \r                                                   Commonwealth v. \r                                                                   Colon-\r\n\nCruz, 562 N.E.2d 797, 809 (Mass. 1990).\r\n\n          In reported Massachusetts cases on peremptory\r\n\nchallenges, state trial judges have often observed and\r\n\nquestioned the jurors in the course of evaluating the\r\n\nchallenges.  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Latimore, 667 N.E.2d\r\n\n818, 824 (Mass. 1996); Commonwealth v. Green, 652 N.E.2d 572,\r\n\n575 (Mass. 1995); Commonwealth v. Paniaqua, 604 N.E.2d 1278,\r\n\n1280 (Mass. 1992); \r                              Commonwealth v. \r                                             Harris, 567 N.E.2d 899, 903-\r\n\n04 (Mass. 1991); Commonwealth v.  Joyce, 467 N.E.2d 214, 218\r\n\n(Mass. 1984).  This indicates that, in these cases, the\r\n\nobjections to the challenges were contemporaneously made.\r\n\nNonetheless, this leaves the matter of whether the trial\r\n\njudge's procedural ruling is based on \"firmly established and\r\n\nregularly followed\" rules. \r\n\n          We doubt that the Supreme Court meant that a rule\r\n\ncould not be \"adequate\" unless articulated with the level of\r\n\n17.  Thus this case appears to be distinguishable from others\r\nwhere the defendant could not have been \"'deemed to have been\r\napprised of [the state rule's] existence.'\" \r                                                       See \r                                                           Ford, 498 U.S.\r\nat 423 (quoting NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 457 (1958)).\r\n\n18.  Trial courts also consider challenges made to similarly\r\nsituated non-black jurors, for comparison purposes, in\r\nevaluating challenges in the context of claims of racial bias.\r\nGreen, 652 N.E.2d at 577 n.7.\r\n\n                            -26-\r                                         26\r\r\n\nspecificity Brewer contemplates. We are satisfied that counsel\r\n\nfor Brewer was adequately on notice of the general\r\n\ncontemporaneous objection rule and of the requirement that a\r\n\nrecord be created sufficient to support review of a    Batson\r\n\nclaim. That may be enough to satisfy the \"adequacy\"\r\n\nrequirement.\r\n\n            Brewer, for his part, strenuously contends that the\r\n\ntrial judge's ruling was not a finding of untimeliness, but a\r\n\ndetermination, on the merits, that he had failed to make a\r\n\nprima facie case of discrimination under \r                                                    Batson. We need not\r\n\nconclusively resolve whether the trial court's ruling, viewed\r\n\nas procedural, would constitute an adequate state ground for\r\n\ndecision in the sense of being a rule \"firmly established and\r\n\nregularly followed.\"    Ford, 498 U.S. at 423-24. Even\r\n\ninterpreting the trial judge's ruling in the way Brewer wishes\r\n\nus to, and thereby reaching the merits of his constitutional\r\n\nclaim, we find that Brewer's petition is doomed. \r\n\nBrewer's Batson Claims\r\n\n          As Brewer urges we do, we view the state trial\r\n\njudge's handling of Brewer's Batson claim as a finding that\r\n\nBrewer failed to show a prima facie case of discrimination. \r\n\nBrewer's habeas petition nonetheless fails.\r\n\n19.  Brewer relies on language in the order denying Brewer's\r\nnew trial motion: \r\n\n          I find no support in the contention that\r\n          the Commonwealth improperly excluded\r\n\n                            -27-\r                                         27\r\r\n\n          Because the new standard of review for habeas\r\n\npetitions outlined in AEDPA is not applicable to pending non-\r\n\ncapital cases like Brewer's, \r                                        see \r                                            Lindh v. \r                                                    Murphy, 117 S. Ct. --\r\n\n- (1997), we apply the habeas standard of review unaltered by\r\n\nAEDPA. Under that standard of review, we review de novo the\r\n\nstate court decision. Martin v. \r                                           Bissonette, 1997 WL 374793, at\r\n\n*3 (1st Cir. July 11, 1997). Within that standard, deference\r\n\nis given to fact-based determinations of the trial court. 28\r\n\nU.S.C. S 2254(d) (pre-AEDPA version). Decisions of trial\r\n\ncourts regarding    Batson objections are treated with\r\n\nconsiderable deference. On direct review, the Supreme Court\r\n\nhas described the ultimate    Batson question -- intent to\r\n\ndiscriminate -- \"as a pure issue of fact\" subject to clear\r\n\nerror review.  Hernandez v. New \r                                            York, 500 U.S. 352, 364, 369\r\n\n(1991) (plurality opinion);    id. at 372 (O'Connor, J.,\r\n\nconcurring). That same clear error standard applies to rulings\r\n\non whether the defendant has made a Batson prima facie case.\r\n\nBergodere, 40 F.3d at 516 (because a Batson determination is\r\n\nparticularly fact-sensitive, it will be accepted unless shown\r\n\nto be clearly erroneous). And there is no convincing reason\r\n\nwhy a more lenient standard should govern pre-AEDPA federal\r\n\n          minorities from the jury. . . . There was\r\n          no showing that the Commonwealth was\r\n          excluding blacks solely by reason of their\r\n          group membership. \r\n\n                            -28-\r                                         28\r\r\n\nhabeas review of state court judgments concerning fact-senstive\r\n\nBatson determinations. Jones v. \r                                            Jones, 938 F.2d 838, 842 (8th\r\n\nCir. 1991).\r\n\n          This deferential approach makes particular sense in\r\n\nthe \r               Batson context.  See \r                                    Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 365 (plurality\r\n\nopinion). The trial judge has heard the juror's answers to\r\n\nvoir dire questions or bench conferences with the juror (such\r\n\nas the individualized voir dire on race bias conducted in this\r\n\nvery case). The trial judge is thus likely to have a much\r\n\nbetter sense than any appellate panel of whether a particular\r\n\nchallenge can readily be explained by some reason other than\r\n\nrace or gender -- for example, other characteristics of the\r\n\njuror, the juror's demeanor, or something in the juror's\r\n\nbackground suggesting sympathy for one side or the other. This\r\n\ncourt has recognized that considerable deference is owed to a\r\n\ntrial judge who observes the voir dire first hand:\r\n\n          Evaluative judgments concerning juror\r\n          suitability are often made partially in\r\n          response to nuance, demeanor, body\r\n          language, and a host of kindred\r\n          considerations. Thus, the trial judge,\r\n          who sees and hears both the prospective\r\n          juror and the opposing attorneys in\r\n          action, is in the best position to pass\r\n          judgment on counsel's motives. \r\n\nBergodere, 40 F.3d at 517. \r\n\n          The Supreme Court has not detailed what may\r\n\nconstitute a prima facie showing under  Batson. Instead, in\r\n\nBatson itself, the Court said:\r\n\n                            -29-\r                                         29\r\r\n\n          For example, a \"pattern\" of strikes against black\r\n          jurors included in the particular venire might give\r\n          rise to an inference of discrimination. Similarly,\r\n          the prosecutor's questions and statements during\r\n          voir dire examination and in exercising his\r\n          challenges may support or refute an inference of\r\n          discriminatory purpose. These examples are merely\r\n          illustrative. We have confidence that trial judges,\r\n          experienced in supervising voir dire, will be able\r\n          to decide if the circumstances concerning a\r\n          prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges creates a\r\n          prima facie case of discrimination against black\r\n          jurors.\r\n\nBatson, 476 U.S. at 97. The Supreme Court has directed trial\r\n\njudges to consider \"all relevant circumstances\" in determining\r\n\nwhether a prima facie case of racial discrimination has been\r\n\nestablished. Id. at 96-97. The Supreme Court has thus largely\r\n\nleft the question of what constitutes a prima facie case to the\r\n\nwisdom of trial judges themselves. Here, the trial judge, in\r\n\nlight of all the circumstances, did not require the prosecution\r\n\nto state a rationale for these strikes, as would have been done\r\n\nif the judge had found a prima facie case of discrimination. \r\n\n          In \r                        Bergodere, this court noted, in rejecting a \r                                                                   Batson\r\n\nclaim based on the peremptory challenge of the only black\r\n\nvenireperson, that \"[a] defendant who advances a       Batson\r\n\nargument ordinarily should 'come forward with facts, not just\r\n\nnumbers alone.'\"  Id. at 516 (citing United \r                                                        States v.

See, \r                              e.g., \r                                    Turner v. \r                                              Marshall, 63 F.3d 807, 812-\r\n\n13 (9th Cir. 1995); United \r                                       States v. Alvarado, 923 F.2d 253,\r\n\n255-56 (2d Cir. 1991); see  also 2 LaFave &amp; Israel,  Criminal\r\n\nProcedure S 21.3, at 257 n.135.7 (Supp. 1991) (citing cases).\r\n\nThis case in the trial court might have been regarded as fairly\r\n\nclose, and the facts  are such that we might have upheld the\r\n\ntrial judge if she had found a prima facie case. It is enough\r\n\nto say that the numbers here, particularly in the absence of\r\n\ncircumstances suggesting juror bias, judge insensitivity, or\r\n\nimproper motive by the state prosecutor, were not so blatant as\r\n\nto compel the judge to make such a finding. \r\n\n          It is the defendant who carries the burden of\r\n\npersuasion regarding the existence of a prima facie case. See\r\n\nBergodere, 40 F.3d at 515. Part of that burden includes the\r\n\nduty to show circumstances sufficient, when combined with the\r\n\ndemonstration that the prosecution's challenge was directed at\r\n\n20.  Here, the numbers at first blush may give one pause,\r\nsince, at the time of Brewer's initial objection, the\r\nprosecution had used four of its nine challenges against\r\nblacks, thus excluding four of the six blacks seated in the\r\njury box (assuming the race of the jurors as Brewer claimed, a\r\nfact not established). However, the state trial judge had\r\nobserved the process and apparently saw nothing serious enough\r\nto demand reasoning from the prosecution. \r\n\n                            -31-\r                                         31\r\r\n\na member of a cognizable racial group and the demonstration\r\n\nthat the challenge was peremptory, to raise an inference that\r\n\nthe prosecutor struck the venireperson on account of race. \r                                                                      See\r\n\nBatson, 476 U.S. at 96;  Bergodere, 40 F.3d at 515-16. The\r\n\ntrial judge here was not persuaded that such an inference of\r\n\ndiscrimination was raised, and having found no clear error in\r\n\nthe trial judge's decision, neither are we.\r\n\nFundamental Miscarriage of Justice\r\n\n          We note that Brewer does suggest that he is actually\r\n\ninnocent of this crime. Although this is not a capital case\r\n\nwhere further review may be required, \r                                                Sawyer v. \r                                                          Whitley, 112 S.\r\n\nCt. 2514 (1992), we explain why we think this case works no\r\n\nfundamental miscarriage of justice. Under     Batson, if the\r\n\npetitioner had established a prima facie case of\r\n\ndiscrimination, the prosecution would have then been required\r\n\nto articulate nondiscriminatory reasons for its challenges.\r\n\nPurkett, 115 S. Ct. at 1770-71. Here, the prosecution was not\r\n\nrequired to provide such an explanation at the time and was\r\n\nunable to recall its reasons when the habeas petition was\r\n\nbrought seven years later. \r\n\n          There is some reason to think there was no infection\r\n\nof the process at all. The trial judge was herself quite\r\n\nsensitive to issues of bias -- it was she, and not counsel, who\r\n\ninitially suggested voir dire as to bias, and she returned to\r\n\nthe point several times. The venire members were, in the end,\r\n\n                            -32-\r                                         32\r\r\n\nasked whether they were prejudiced against African Americans or\r\n\nHispanics and one was dismissed for bias. Such a voir dire\r\n\ncreates a \"high probability that the individual jurors seated\r\n\nin a particular case were free from bias.\" \r                                                      Allen v. \r                                                               Hardy, 478\r\n\nU.S. 255, 259 (1986) (per curiam). Accordingly, we do not\r\n\nthink that the factfinding process was tainted, causing a\r\n\nmiscarriage of justice here.  Id.\r\n\n          Of course, the core \r                                         Batson principle is that \"states\r\n\ndo not discriminate against citizens who are summoned to sit in\r\n\njudgment against a member of their own race.\" Allen, 478 U.S.\r\n\nat 259. This principle \"strengthens public confidence in the\r\n\nadministration of justice.\" Id. As to the first four jurors,\r\n\nwe have no evidence that the Commonwealth was discriminating\r\n\nagainst black venire members. But as to the fifth juror, the\r\n\nprosecution did have a valid nondiscriminatory reason for the\r\n\nchallenge.\r\n\nThe Brady Claim\r\n\n          As to the claim that the boyfriend's identity should\r\n\nhave been earlier disclosed, we agree with the district court\r\n\nthat there was no Brady violation. The trial court correctly\r\n\napplied federal law, and her factual determinations were\r\n\ncertainly not clearly erroneous. See 28 U.S.C. S 2254(d) (pre-\r\n\nAEDPA version).\r\n\n            Brewer did not ask for the boyfriend's identity\r\n\nuntil the first day of trial, and when he did obtain it, he did\r\n\n                            -33-\r                                         33\r\r\n\nnot ask for a continuance to make full use of the information.\r\n\nMost important, as the district court so aptly observed, \"there\r\n\nis no evidence the government knew that the boyfriend's\r\n\nidentity was potentially exculpatory prior to trial. . . . The\r\n\ngovernment believed the boyfriend was the semen donor and that\r\n\nthis evidence, in itself, was incriminatory rather than\r\n\nexculpatory.\" The rule in    Brady does not typically apply\r\n\nunless the prosecutor has knowledge of the exculpatory\r\n\nevidence. See, \r                           e.g., \r                                 United States\r                                               v. \r                                                  Moore, 25 F.3d 563, 569\r\n\n(7th Cir. 1994). \r\n\n          That Brewer later produced evidence that the\r\n\nboyfriend was not the source of the semen does not put \"the\r\n\nwhole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence\r\n\nin the verdict.\"   Kyles v.  Whitley, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 1565\r\n\n(1995).  Given all the evidence, Brewer has not met his\r\n\nburden. \r\n\n          The grant of the writ of habeas corpus is  reversed\r\n\nand the writ is vacated.\r\n\n21.  As the district court noted, the victim testified Brewer\r\npenetrated her twice, once with a condom and once without, but\r\nthere was no evidence he ejaculated.\r\n\n                            -34-\r                                         34\r\n",

Brewer, an African American Boston police officer, was charged with the 1988 kidnapping and rape of a fifteen-year-old minority woman.  During the jury impanelment for his state court trial, the prosecutor exercised three rounds of his peremptory challenges, including challenges to four black jurors.  At the end of these three rounds, and after the prosecutor had announced himself satisfied, defense counsel objected on the ground that the prosecution had purposefully sought to eliminate black<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> jurors.  The judge overruled the objection on the ground that it should have been made earlier, and thus did not require the prosecution to meet the merits of the objection.  When the prosecution struck a fifth black juror the next day, the defense promptly objected that this peremptory challenge was racially biased.  The prosecution presented a nondiscriminatory reason for striking the juror, and the court overruled the objection on the merits.  Brewer was convicted, and the conviction was summarily affirmed on appeal by the Massachusetts Appeals Court.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court declined further review.  In November 1993, Brewer filed his petition for habeas review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seven years after the state trial, a federal district court issued a writ of habeas corpus, requiring Brewer to be retried or released.  The court ruled that Brewer had, on the numbers, made a prima facie case that he had been denied his constitutional right to a trial before a jury of his peers, which the state no longer had the evidence to rebut, and thus there was a violation of Batson v. IKentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986).

The prosecution presented evidence that Brewer ordered the father to leave the area, put the young woman in his police cruiser, drove to another location, and raped her.  The father had attempted to follow in his car but could not keep up.  After the rape, Brewer drove the victim home and told her to keep quiet.  Instead, she immediately told her mother and father, who then reported the rape to the police.  After being treated at a hospital, the victim directed police to the scene of the rape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the scene, police found half of the girl's school class schedule on the ground.  Police logs also indicated that Brewer had failed to respond to four \"priority calls\" during the time period in which the girl claimed to have been raped.  Brewer's story was that he interrupted the father having sexual intercourse with the daughter, ordered the father to leave, and then took the young woman home.  Brewer did not arrest the father, seek medical attention for the daughter, or file an incident report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brewer was charged with kidnapping and rape, violations of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 265, &#167;&#167; 26, 22A.  Jury impanelment for Brewer's trial began on December 15, 1989.  During the general voir dire, after six jurors had been excused for inability to serve, the trial judge inquired about the race of the victim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The judge expressed concern that neither side had requested a voir dire on the issue of race, and asked whether it was an issue in the case.  Both the prosecutor and the defense counsel responded that it was not.  The judge then continued with the general voir dire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After excusing five more jurors who were unable to serve, the judge again suspended the proceedings and insisted that defense counsel ask Brewer himself whether he wanted a voir dire on racial bias.  The court, at Brewer's request, then proceeded with an individual voir dire on racial and ethnic bias after excusing the thirteen remaining jurors who were unable to serve.  The judge asked each juror, out of the presence of other jurors, whether they had any bias or prejudice for or against black persons or persons of Hispanic origin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of the individual voir dire, one juror had been excused due to racial bias;  fourteen of the remaining prospective jurors were seated in the jury box.  The first round of peremptory challenges began with the prosecutor, who asked that six jurors be excused.  Defense counsel did not object to any of the challenges.  The clerk then excused those six jurors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After six new jurors were seated, a second round of challenges began.  The prosecutor made two more peremptory challenges.  Defense counsel did not object.  These two challenged jurors were excused and then replaced.  In the third round, the prosecutor challenged one juror.  Again, with no objection from defense counsel, the challenged juror was excused and replaced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having challenged nine jurors over three rounds, the prosecutor informed the court and defense counsel at side bar that the Commonwealth stood content.  At this point, defense counsel for the first time objected on race grounds, saying that four of the nine prospective jurors who had been excused were black:  \"We had a fair representation racially of six and now we're down to two.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After initially asking the prosecutor to explain his reasons for making the challenges, the trial court withdrew its request and instructed defense counsel that he should raise his objection to a peremptory challenge \"at the time the challenge is made.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the defense counsel complained that he had not seen \"the pattern emerge until it was completed,\" he did not create a record of the races of the challenged jurors.  The judge continued with the impanelment, giving defense counsel the opportunity to make his own peremptory challenges.  Defense counsel's challenges resulted in the exclusion of fourteen more jurors including one man who may have been black,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and the exhaustion of the jury pool.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the second day of jury selection, after the judge excused those unable to serve and asked each of the prospective jurors about racial bias, the state exercised two peremptory challenges.  One of the challenged jurors was black.  Just after that juror was excused and replaced, Brewer's counsel objected and then specifically identified the number of the black juror at the court's request.  The court then, consistent with its prior statement, asked the state to explain why it made the challenge.  The state responded that the juror had two children roughly the same age as Brewer and therefore might be sympathetic to him.  The court rejected the objection.  The impanelment then continued with defense counsel making the remainder of his challenges, and the court excused three more jurors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, only one African American was on the jury panel.  This sole black juror was randomly chosen to be an alternate and did not engage in deliberations.  In sum, a total of forty-five potential jurors went through the jury box;  seven were black.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  There is no evidence as to the total number of black potential jurors.  The government exercised eleven peremptory challenges, five of which were against black venire members.  Brewer used one of his seventeen peremptory challenges to strike a black potential juror.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial, Brewer filed a motion to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct, arguing that the state had failed to disclose material and exculpatory evidence in violation of the rule articulated in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).  Brewer complained that the prosecutor had delayed revealing test results that were inconclusive as to whether semen found in the victim was in fact Brewer's.  At a bench conference on the first day of trial, the prosecutor had stated that, if Brewer were to introduce evidence that he was not the source of the semen, the victim would be forced to testify that the source was her boyfriend, with whom she had had sexual intercourse before the rape.  Defense counsel argued that the alleged victim's prior unprotected intercourse with her boyfriend was exculpatory for his client, because it suggested that she might have a motivation for fabrication.  Counsel asked that if the court refused to dismiss the case, that it order the Commonwealth to disclose the boyfriend's identity.  The trial court denied the motion to dismiss and did not order disclosure of the boyfriend's identity on the ground that the Massachusetts Rape Shield Law prohibits the introduction of a victim's sexual history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the last day of trial, Brewer presented expert testimony that he was not the source of the semen.  He then testified that when he found the victim and her father in the car, she was naked and her father's pants were down, thus suggesting that the father was the source of the semen.  The victim testified on rebuttal that she had had unprotected sex with her boyfriend suggesting that the semen was his.  Defense counsel objected, saying that he had asked for the boyfriend's name earlier and was now precluded from making a credibility argument.  The court declined to revisit the issue.  After trial, Brewer had blood samples from the boyfriend tested.  The results indicated that the boyfriend was not the source of the semen.  Brewer then filed a motion for a new trial based on this \"newly discovered\" evidence.  The motion was denied on the ground that the defendant had already presented expert testimony that he was not the source of the semen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brewer was convicted and sentenced to nine-to-twelve years' imprisonment for rape and three-to-five years for kidnapping, to be served concurrently.  He appealed his conviction to the Massachusetts Appeals Court.  Prior to a decision on appeal, he filed a motion for new trial with the trial court, arguing, inter alia, that the prosecutor had impermissibly used peremptory challenges based on race.  The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brewer filed an appeal from the denial of the new trial motion, which was consolidated with his direct appeal.  In response to Brewer's arguments, the state argued that, by waiting to object until after all four jurors were dismissed, Brewer had failed to object in a timely fashion to the state's disputed peremptories.  In a one-and-a-half page opinion, the Appeals Court upheld Brewer's conviction:  \"Substantially for those reasons set out in the Commonwealth's brief and the trial judge's memorandum of decision in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial, we conclude that there is no basis for disturbing the defendant's convictions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brewer filed an application for leave to obtain further appellate review with the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.  The request was denied without opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brewer petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts in November 1993.  He argued that the prosecution made racially motivated peremptory challenges, thereby violating his Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection and due process of law as established in Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986).  He also renewed his claim that the state had withheld exculpatory evidence in violation of the Brady rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied relief on the Brady claim, but found that Brewer had made a prima facie case of discrimination under Batson.   The district court gave plenary review to the question of racial discrimination and relied solely on numbers to conclude that a prima facie case was established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Engaging in its own statistical analysis, the district court concluded that there was a pattern that demonstrated a statistical disparity sufficient to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination under Batson.   The district court noted that when Brewer first made a Batson objection, the prosecutor had exercised nine peremptories, four of which were used to excuse four out of six black venirepersons.  In doing this, the court found that the prosecutor used 44% of his strikes in the first round to excuse 66% of the black persons then impaneled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were no statistics available as to the racial composition of the venire which had been found to be unbiased after voir dire or the racial composition of Suffolk County from which the venire was drawn.  The district court, however, estimated that 15% of the entire venire was black based on the fact that out of a total of 45 potential jurors who had passed through the box, seven were black.  Thus, the court reasoned, the prosecutor's strike rate against blacks in the first round (66%) was several times larger than the population of the blacks in the venire (15%).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the new standard of review outlined in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. 104-132 (\"AEDPA\"), the court found that the estimated numbers based on the \"pattern\" of strikes alone constituted a prima facie case of discrimination under \"clearly established\" Supreme Court law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then ordered an evidentiary hearing to allow the state to offer nondiscriminatory reasons for the challenges.  The state was unable, seven years after the trial, to produce any evidence.  The prosecutor said that he could not recall the reasons and had long since destroyed his trial notes.  The court granted the writ on Batson grounds on September 30, 1996, but stayed its issuance to allow for an appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seeking clarification, the state returned to Suffolk County Superior Court and filed a request for the original trial judge to explain her rulings on Brewer's Batson claims.  After conducting a hearing, the trial judge issued a memorandum stating that she had rejected the initial Batson claim on timeliness grounds.  Because the excused potential jurors had already left the courtroom, she was unable to observe their races and demeanors at the time of the objection.  She was therefore unable to make a meaningful evaluation of the defendant's claim that the prosecutor had made race-based peremptory challenges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this response, the state filed a motion for reconsideration in the federal district court, arguing that habeas review was barred by procedural default.  The court found the state's new argument unpersuasive and denied the motion, holding that there was no independent and adequate state ground.  The Commonwealth appeals, arguing, inter alia, that the district court erred in concluding that there was no procedural default on the Batson claim.  Additionally, Brewer contends on appeal that the government's failure to disclose, in a timely fashion, the boyfriend's identity deprived him of the opportunity to counter the \"boyfriend story\" in violation of his constitutional rights to a fair trial and due process of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>The Batson Claim and Limits on Federal Habeas Review Independent And Adequate State Grounds</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state asserts that review is barred under the \"independent and adequate state ground\" doctrine.  Under that doctrine, federal courts sitting to hear habeas petitions from state prisoners are barred from reviewing federal questions which the state court declined to hear because the prisoner failed to meet a state procedural requirement.  Lambrix v. Singletary, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 1517, 137 L.Ed.2d 771 (1997).  In such cases, the state judgment is said to rest on independent and adequate state procedural grounds.  Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 109 S.Ct. 1038, 103 L.Ed.2d 308 (1989);  Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977).  Considerations of comity and federalism bar the federal court's review.  Lambrix, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 117 S.Ct. at 1522-23 (\"A State's procedural rules are of vital importance to the orderly administration of its criminal courts;  when a federal court permits them to be readily evaded, it undermines the criminal justice system.\").  \"[A] habeas petitioner who has failed to meet the State's procedural requirements for presenting his federal claims has deprived the state courts of an opportunity to address those claims in the first instance.\"  Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 732, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 2555, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991).  Without the \"independent and adequate state ground\" doctrine, federal courts would be able to review claims the state courts never had a proper chance to consider.  Lambrix, --- U.S. at ----, 117 S.Ct. at 1523.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are, however, exceptions to the bar on habeas review if the prisoner \"can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\"  Coleman, 501 U.S. at 749-50, 111 S.Ct. at 2565.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, although the state did not raise the procedural default issue in the federal habeas court until a motion for reconsideration, the district court ruled that it would consider the procedural default argument on its merits, in the interests of comity.  As the district court properly noted, it has the authority to consider the procedural default issue sua sponte.  Ortiz v. Dubois, 19 F.3d 708 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1085, 115 S.Ct. 739, 130 L.Ed.2d 641 (1995);  see also Henderson v. Thieret, 859 F.2d 492, 493 (7th Cir.1988).  Although belated, the Commonwealth did make the argument in the state trial court, and the issue was fully briefed both there and here.  The procedural default issue was also squarely presented to the state appellate courts on direct review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the merits of the procedural default argument, the district court held:  \"Because the [Massachusetts] Appeals Court gave no plain statement as to its reasons for upholding the conviction, this Court on habeas corpus review presumes that there [are] no independent and adequate state grounds barring review.\"   The Commonwealth challenges this finding.  We start with the doctrine of independent and state grounds, focusing first on the question of independence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Independence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, a federal habeas court defers to a state court's articulation of a state law ground for a decision.  When the state decision \"fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law or to be interwoven with federal law,\" the federal court presumes there is no independent and adequate state ground for the decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Coleman, 501 U.S. at 733, 111 S.Ct. at 2555-56 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  However, that presumption does not apply where, as here, there is no \"clear indication that [the] state court rested its decision on federal law.\"  Id. at 739-40, 111 S.Ct. at 2559.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The one-and-a-half page summary order of the Massachusetts Appeals Court is the last expression of opinion from the state courts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The final state court word on the matter refers us to the opinion of the trial court and the Commonwealth's state appellate brief.  The state appellate court denied the appeal \"substantially for the reasons set forth in the Commonwealth's brief and the trial judge's memorandum of decision in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial.\"   In Coleman, the state court likewise issued a summary order referring to its consideration of all of the filed papers, including the briefs of the petitioner and the state.  The Supreme Court acknowledged that this language raised some ambiguity because the briefs referred to federal claims.  Id. at 744, 111 S.Ct. at 2561.

Additionally, it argued on the merits that striking the fifth black juror did not violate the Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court's memorandum of decision on Brewer's new trial motion was responsive to the arguments presented in the motion, which rested \"primarily on the grounds of newly discovered evidence.\"   Brewer presented only a generalized argument about the exclusion of blacks from the jury in his motion:  \"Due to challenges from the prosecution, most black jurors were excluded from the jury and none deliberated on the verdict.\"   Brewer's motion did not, on its face, challenge the earlier ruling that Brewer's objection to the prosecution's exercise of peremptories to strike four black venire members was untimely.  The order of the state judge denying the new trial motion may appear at first to be somewhat ambiguous because it starts with a statement that the court found no support for the contention that the Commonwealth had improperly excluded blacks from the jury.  However, the part of the state court opinion dealing with the jury selection procedures only concerns the challenge by the prosecution of the fifth black juror.  There is no discussion of defendant's earlier objection.  In his application for leave to obtain further appellate review from the Supreme Judicial Court, Brewer admitted that there was no discussion of the legality of the exclusion of the four prospective jurors in the trial judge's memorandum addressing the new trial motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is certainly reason to believe that the basis for the ruling as to the timing of the objection to the prosecutor's first four peremptories against black jurors was an independent state procedural ground.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  As a result, we consider the state's argument that the state appeals court ruling rested on the grounds that the challenge to the exclusion of the first four jurors was not timely made and that the challenge to the fifth black juror was valid under the Batson standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Adequacy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"adequacy\" of this state procedural ground, for federal habeas purposes, is another issue.  Batson itself declined to decide when an objection must be made in order to be timely and left that matter to be resolved by local law.  Batson, 476 U.S. at 99-100 &amp; n. 24, 106 S.Ct. at 1724-25 &amp; n. 24.  There are no Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court cases establishing precisely when in the sequence of events an objection to a peremptory challenge must be made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brewer's challenge rests largely on the ground that state procedural requirements \"cannot be permitted to thwart review applied for by those who, in justified reliance on prior decisions, seek vindication in state courts of their federal constitutional rights.\"  NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 457-58, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 1169, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958).  State rules may not procedurally bar a federal court from hearing a Batson claim on timeliness grounds if the rule is not \"firmly established and regularly followed.\"  Ford v. Georgia, 498 U.S. 411, 423, 111 S.Ct. 850, 857, 112 L.Ed.2d 935 (1991).  In Ford, the Supreme Court declined to honor a procedural bar where the defense counsel had in fact raised the Batson issue prior to jury selection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ford made clear that state procedures may not completely preclude the very opportunity to raise constitutional claims.  See also James v. Kentucky, 466 U.S. 341, 348-52, 104 S.Ct. 1830, 1835-37, 80 L.Ed.2d 346 (1984);  Michel v. Louisiana, 350 U.S. 91, 93-94, 76 S.Ct. 158, 160, 100 L.Ed. 83 (1955);  cf. Powell v. Nevada, 511 U.S. 79, 83-84, 114 S.Ct. 1280, 1283, 128 L.Ed.2d 1 (1994).  Brewer argues that requiring a defendant to object to a challenge on the ground of a pattern of racially exclusionary strikes before the pattern emerges raises constitutional issues.  For example, he says he should not have had to object to the strike of the first black juror on the ground of a pattern of racial discrimination if he did not see the pattern until the strike of the fourth black juror.  If that were what happened in this case, we would have considerable sympathy for the argument.  But that is not what happened.  As the state trial court said in its clarification memo, any pattern emerged at the latest with the strike of the fourth juror;  the defense should have made its objection at that time rather than waiting until later:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>The defendant's counsel could have raised the issue of impermissible peremptories after the Commonwealth indicated a desire at side bar to excuse the first six jurors, or the next two jurors, or the final juror, and before those jurors were excused but not after the Commonwealth said it was content.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no constitutional impediment to a state procedural ruling such as the trial judge stated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if there is no constitutional impediment to the state procedural rule, the Supreme Court has said that the rule must be \"firmly established and regularly followed.\"  Ford, 498 U.S. at 423-24, 111 S.Ct. at 857.   The Commonwealth relies on Massachusetts' firmly entrenched contemporaneous objection rule.  Commonwealth v. Fluker, 377 Mass. 123, 385 N.E.2d 256, 261 (1979).  In cases where defense counsel fails to make a timely objection, the state does not waive the objection, and the appellate decision rested on that ground, that is \"a classic example of a procedural default, and petitioner can succeed in his habeas case only by showing cognizable cause for, and cognizable prejudice from, his procedural default or, alternatively, by demonstrating that the federal court's failure to address the claim on habeas review will occasion a miscarriage of justice.\"  Burks v. Dubois, 55 F.3d 712, 716 (1st Cir.1995) (failure to object to prosecutor's misstatement of evidence at closing precludes habeas review);  see also Puleio v. Vose, 830 F.2d 1197, 1199 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing the value of contemporaneous objections, this court has itself rejected review of Batson claims where defense counsel failed to make timely and adequate objection at trial.  In United States v. Pulgarin, 955 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1992), we rejected direct review where the defense counsel had made an aborted attempt at trial to raise a Batson claim, saying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>[C]ontemporaneous objection is especially pertinent as to Batson claims, where innocent oversight can so readily be remedied and an accurate record of the racial composition is crucial on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pulgarin, 955 F.2d at 1.

Mosby, 11 Mass.App.Ct. 1, 413 N.E.2d 754, 762 n. 4 (1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As she stated in her clarification memorandum, the state trial judge felt hampered in her ability to fairly evaluate the objection to the peremptory challenges by the timing and method of the objection.  Defense counsel did not refer to the four jurors in question by their juror numbers or other identification, but only said that they were black.  At the time of the objection, those jurors had already been excused and had left the courtroom.  There is no indication (because defense counsel created no record) of where in the sequence of the prosecutor's nine peremptory challenges these four fell or whether the court or counsel had a clear memory of who those jurors were.  Nor did counsel create a record of the race of the jurors.  As the trial judge said, working later from her memory:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>The race or ethnicity of the jurors cannot be definitely known.  As defendant's counsel stated during impanelment \"I have no way to distinguish between Hispanic and black.\"   Tr. 1-125.  The court does recall that there were discussions with counsel, on and off the record, concerning the race and ethnicity of various members of the venire.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge commented that the lateness of counsel's objection--after all the jurors at issue had left--meant that she had \"no opportunity to observe the demeanor or appearance or race of the excused jurors or to evaluate meaningfully the Commonwealth's challenges.\"   See also United States v. Bergodere, 40 F.3d 512, 517 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this general level, there is support for the Commonwealth's argument that this case involves an application of the contemporaneous objection rule.  Even before Batson, Massachusetts, acting under its own Constitution, prohibited the racial use of peremptory challenges in 1979.  See Commonwealth v. Soares, 377 Mass. 461, 387 N.E.2d 499 (1979).  Subsequent cases made it clear that Soares challenges had to be made at a time sufficient to \"provide[ ] the trial judge and opposing counsel with an opportunity to address the matter.  This, in turn ... created a record which was adequate for appellate review.\"  Commonwealth v. Bourgeois, 391 Mass. 869, 465 N.E.2d 1180, 1186 n. 11 (1984);  cf. Commonwealth v. Smith, 404 Mass. 1, 532 N.E.2d 1207, 1209 (1989).  Bourgeois made the record creation expectation explicit:  \"A record in which [the prosecution] has not had an opportunity to explain the use of peremptory challenges is inadequate to raise a Soares violation.\"  Bourgeois, 465 N.E.2d at 1186;  see also Commonwealth v. Colon-Cruz, 408 Mass. 533, 562 N.E.2d 797, 809 (1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reported Massachusetts cases on peremptory challenges, state trial judges have often observed and questioned the jurors in the course of evaluating the challenges.  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Latimore, 423 Mass. 129, 667 N.E.2d 818, 824 (1996);  Commonwealth v. Green, 420 Mass. 771, 652 N.E.2d 572, 575 (1995);  Commonwealth v. Paniaqua, 413 Mass. 796, 604 N.E.2d 1278, 1280 (1992);  Commonwealth v. Harris, 409 Mass. 461, 567 N.E.2d 899, 903-04 (1991);  Commonwealth v. Joyce, 18 Mass.App.Ct. 417, 467 N.E.2d 214, 218 (1984).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  This indicates that, in these cases, the objections to the challenges were contemporaneously made.  Nonetheless, this leaves the matter of whether the trial judge's procedural ruling is based on \"firmly established and regularly followed\" rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We doubt that the Supreme Court meant that a rule could not be \"adequate\" unless articulated with the level of specificity Brewer contemplates.  We are satisfied that counsel for Brewer was adequately on notice of the general contemporaneous objection rule and of the requirement that a record be created sufficient to support review of a Batson claim.  That may be enough to satisfy the \"adequacy\" requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brewer, for his part, strenuously contends that the trial judge's ruling was not a finding of untimeliness, but a determination, on the merits, that he had failed to make a case of discrimination under Batson.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  We need not conclusively resolve whether the trial court's ruling, viewed as procedural, would constitute an adequate state ground for decision in the sense of being a rule \"firmly established and regularly followed.\"  Ford, 498 U.S. at 423-24, 111 S.Ct. at 857.   Even interpreting the trial judge's ruling in the way Brewer wishes us to, and thereby reaching the merits of his constitutional claim, we find that Brewer's petition is doomed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Brewer's Batson Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Brewer urges we do, we view the state trial judge's handling of Brewer's Batson claim as a finding on the merits.  Brewer's habeas petition nonetheless fails.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the new standard of review for habeas petitions outlined in AEDPA is not applicable to pending non-capital cases like Brewer's, see Lindh v. Murphy, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 726, 136 L.Ed.2d 643 (1997), we apply the habeas standard of review unaltered by AEDPA.  Under that standard of review, we review de novo the state court decision.  Martin v. Bissonette, 118 F.3d 871, 874-75 (1st Cir.1997).  Within that standard, deference is given to fact-based determinations of the trial court.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d) (pre-AEDPA version).  Decisions of trial courts regarding Batson objections are treated with considerable deference.  On direct review, the Supreme Court has described the ultimate Batson question--intent to discriminate--\"as a pure issue of fact\" subject to clear error review.  Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 364, 369, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 1869, 1871-72, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991) (plurality opinion);  id. at 372, 111 S.Ct. at 1873 (O'Connor, J., concurring).  That same clear error standard applies to rulings on whether the defendant has made a Batson prima facie case.  Bergodere, 40 F.3d at 516 (because a Batson determination is particularly fact-sensitive, it will be accepted unless shown to be clearly erroneous).  And there is no convincing reason why a more lenient standard should govern pre-AEDPA federal habeas review of state court judgments concerning fact-sensitive Batson determinations.  Jones v. Jones, 938 F.2d 838, 842 (8th Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This deferential approach makes particular sense in the Batson context.  See Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 365, 111 S.Ct. at 1869 (plurality opinion).  The trial judge has heard the juror's answers to voir dire questions or bench conferences with the juror (such as the individualized voir dire on race bias conducted in this very case).  The trial judge is thus likely to have a much better sense than any appellate panel of whether a particular challenge can readily be explained by some reason other than race or gender--for example, other characteristics of the juror, the juror's demeanor, or something in the juror's background suggesting sympathy for one side or the other.  This court has recognized that considerable deference is owed to a trial judge who observes the voir dire first hand:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>Evaluative judgments concerning juror suitability are often made partially in response to nuance, demeanor, body language, and a host of kindred considerations.  Thus, the trial judge, who sees and hears both the prospective juror and the opposing attorneys in action, is in the best position to pass judgment on counsel's motives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bergodere, 40 F.3d at 517.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has not detailed what may constitute a prima facie showing under Batson.

Similarly, the prosecutor's questions and statements during voir dire examination and in exercising his challenges may support or refute an inference of discriminatory purpose.  These examples are merely illustrative.  We have confidence that trial judges, experienced in supervising voir dire, will be able to decide if the circumstances concerning a prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges creates a prima facie case of discrimination against black jurors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Batson, 476 U.S. at 97, 106 S.Ct. at 1723.   The Supreme Court has directed trial judges to consider \"all relevant circumstances\" in determining whether a prima facie case of racial discrimination has been established.  Id. at 96-97, 106 S.Ct. at 1723.   The Supreme Court has thus largely left the question of what constitutes a prima facie case to the wisdom of trial judges themselves.  Here, the trial judge, in light of all the circumstances, did not require the prosecution to state a rationale for these strikes, as would have been done if the judge had found a prima facie case of discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Bergodere, this court noted, in rejecting a Batson claim based on the peremptory challenge of the only black venireperson, that \"[a] defendant who advances a Batson argument ordinarily should 'come forward with facts, not just numbers alone.' \"  Id. at 516 (citing United States v. Moore, 895 F.2d 484, 485 (8th Cir.1990) and United States v. Dawn, 897 F.2d 1444, 1448 (8th Cir.1990)). The Seventh Circuit has similarly expressed reservations about the use of numbers alone.  McCain v. Gramley, 96 F.3d 288, 292 (7th Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 1320, 137 L.Ed.2d 482 (1997);  see also United States v.

See, e.g., Turner v. Marshall, 63 F.3d 807, 812-13 (9th Cir.1995);  United States v. Alvarado, 923 F.2d 253, 255-56 (2d Cir.1991);  see also 2 LaFave &amp; Israel,  Criminal Procedure &#167; 21.3, at 257 n. 135.7 (Supp.1991) (citing cases).  This case in the trial court might have been regarded as fairly close, and the facts<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> are such that we might have upheld the trial judge if she had found a prima facie case.  It is enough to say that the numbers here, particularly in the absence of circumstances suggesting juror bias, judge insensitivity, or improper motive by the state prosecutor, were not so blatant as to compel the judge to make such a finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is the defendant who carries the burden of persuasion regarding the existence of a prima facie case.  See Bergodere, 40 F.3d at 515.   Part of that burden includes the duty to show circumstances sufficient, when combined with the demonstration that the prosecution's challenge was directed at a member of a cognizable racial group and the demonstration that the challenge was peremptory, to raise an inference that the prosecutor struck the venireperson on account of race.  See Batson, 476 U.S. at 96, 106 S.Ct. at 1723;  Bergodere, 40 F.3d at 515-16.   The trial judge here was not persuaded that such an inference of discrimination was raised, and having found no clear error in the trial judge's decision, neither are we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Fundamental Miscarriage of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that Brewer does suggest that he is actually innocent of this crime.  Although this is not a capital case where further review may be required, Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U.S. 333, 112 S.Ct. 2514, 120 L.Ed.2d 269 (1992), we explain why we think this case works no fundamental miscarriage of justice.  Under Batson, if the petitioner had established a prima facie case of discrimination, the prosecution would have then been required to articulate nondiscriminatory reasons for its challenges.  Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765, 766-68, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 1770-71, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995).   Here, the prosecution was not required to provide such an explanation at the time and was unable to recall its reasons when the habeas petition was brought seven years later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is some reason to think there was no infection of the process at all.  The trial judge was herself quite sensitive to issues of bias--it was she, and not counsel, who initially suggested voir dire as to bias, and she returned to the point several times.  The venire members were, in the end, asked whether they were prejudiced against African Americans or Hispanics and one was dismissed for bias.  Such a voir dire creates a \"high probability that the individual jurors seated in a particular case were free from bias.\"  Allen v. Hardy, 478 U.S. 255, 259, 106 S.Ct. 2878, 2881, 92 L.Ed.2d 199 (1986) (per curiam).  Accordingly, we do not think that the factfinding process was tainted, causing a miscarriage of justice here.

This principle \"strengthens public confidence in the administration of justice.\"  Id. As to the first four jurors, we have no evidence that the Commonwealth was discriminating against black venire members.  But as to the fifth juror, the prosecution did have a valid nondiscriminatory reason for the challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Brady Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the claim that the boyfriend's identity should have been earlier disclosed, we agree with the district court that there was no Brady violation.  The trial court correctly applied federal law, and her factual determinations were certainly not clearly erroneous.

Most important, as the district court so aptly observed, \"there is no evidence the government knew that the boyfriend's identity was potentially exculpatory prior to trial....  The government believed the boyfriend was the semen donor and that this evidence, in itself, was incriminatory rather than exculpatory.\"   The rule in Brady does not typically apply unless the prosecutor has knowledge of the exculpatory evidence.

Brewer, an African American Boston police officer, was charged with the 1988 kidnapping and rape of a fifteen-year-old minority woman.  During the jury impanelment for his state court trial, the prosecutor exercised three rounds of his peremptory challenges, including challenges to four black jurors.  At the end of these three rounds, and after the prosecutor had announced himself satisfied, defense counsel objected on the ground that the prosecution had purposefully sought to eliminate black<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> jurors.  The judge overruled the objection on the ground that it should have been made earlier, and thus did not require the prosecution to meet the merits of the objection.  When the prosecution struck a fifth black juror the next day, the defense promptly objected that this peremptory challenge was racially biased.  The prosecution presented a nondiscriminatory reason for striking the juror, and the court overruled the objection on the merits.  Brewer was convicted, and the conviction was summarily affirmed on appeal by the Massachusetts Appeals Court.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court declined further review.

The prosecution presented evidence that Brewer ordered the father to leave the area, put the young woman in his police cruiser, drove to another location, and raped her.  The father had attempted to follow in his car but could not keep up.  After the rape, Brewer drove the victim home and told her to keep quiet.  Instead, she immediately told her mother and father, who then reported the rape to the police.

Police logs also indicated that Brewer had failed to respond to four \"priority calls\" during the time period in which the girl claimed to have been raped.  Brewer's story was that he interrupted the father having sexual intercourse with the daughter, ordered the father to leave, and then took the young woman home.  Brewer did not arrest the father, seek medical attention for the daughter, or file an incident report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brewer was charged with kidnapping and rape, violations of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 265, &#167;&#167; 26, 22A.  Jury impanelment for Brewer's trial began on December 15, 1989.  During the general voir dire, after six jurors had been excused for inability to serve, the trial judge inquired about the race of the victim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The judge expressed concern that neither side had requested a voir dire on the issue of race, and asked whether it was an issue in the case.  Both the prosecutor and the defense counsel responded that it was not.  The judge then continued with the general voir dire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After excusing five more jurors who were unable to serve, the judge again suspended the proceedings and insisted that defense counsel ask Brewer himself whether he wanted a voir dire on racial bias.  The court, at Brewer's request, then proceeded with an individual voir dire on racial and ethnic bias after excusing the thirteen remaining jurors who were unable to serve.  The judge asked each juror, out of the presence of other jurors, whether they had any bias or prejudice for or against black persons or persons of Hispanic origin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of the individual voir dire, one juror had been excused due to racial bias;  fourteen of the remaining prospective jurors were seated in the jury box.  The first round of peremptory challenges began with the prosecutor, who asked that six jurors be excused.  Defense counsel did not object to any of the challenges.  The clerk then excused those six jurors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After six new jurors were seated, a second round of challenges began.  The prosecutor made two more peremptory challenges.  Defense counsel did not object.  These two challenged jurors were excused and then replaced.  In the third round, the prosecutor challenged one juror.  Again, with no objection from defense counsel, the challenged juror was excused and replaced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having challenged nine jurors over three rounds, the prosecutor informed the court and defense counsel at side bar that the Commonwealth stood content.  At this point, defense counsel for the first time objected on race grounds, saying that four of the nine prospective jurors who had been excused were black:  \"We had a fair representation racially of six and now we're down to two.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After initially asking the prosecutor to explain his reasons for making the challenges, the trial court withdrew its request and instructed defense counsel that he should raise his objection to a peremptory challenge \"at the time the challenge is made.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the defense counsel complained that he had not seen \"the pattern emerge until it was completed,\" he did not create a record of the races of the challenged jurors.  The judge continued with the impanelment, giving defense counsel the opportunity to make his own peremptory challenges.  Defense counsel's challenges resulted in the exclusion of fourteen more jurors including one man who may have been black,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and the exhaustion of the jury pool.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the second day of jury selection, after the judge excused those unable to serve and asked each of the prospective jurors about racial bias, the state exercised two peremptory challenges.  One of the challenged jurors was black.  Just after that juror was excused and replaced, Brewer's counsel objected and then specifically identified the number of the black juror at the court's request.  The court then, consistent with its prior statement, asked the state to explain why it made the challenge.  The state responded that the juror had two children roughly the same age as Brewer and therefore might be sympathetic to him.  The court rejected the objection.  The impanelment then continued with defense counsel making the remainder of his challenges, and the court excused three more jurors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, only one African American was on the jury panel.  This sole black juror was randomly chosen to be an alternate and did not engage in deliberations.  In sum, a total of forty-five potential jurors went through the jury box;  seven were black.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  There is no evidence as to the total number of black potential jurors.  The government exercised eleven peremptory challenges, five of which were against black venire members.  Brewer used one of his seventeen peremptory challenges to strike a black potential juror.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial, Brewer filed a motion to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct, arguing that the state had failed to disclose material and exculpatory evidence in violation of the rule articulated in Brady v. Maryland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span> </a></span>(1963).  Brewer complained that the prosecutor had delayed revealing test results that were inconclusive as to whether semen found in the victim was in fact Brewer's.  At a bench conference on the first day of trial, the prosecutor had stated that, if Brewer were to introduce evidence that he was not the source of the semen, the victim would be forced to testify that the source was her boyfriend, with whom she had had sexual intercourse before the rape.  Defense counsel argued that the alleged victim's prior unprotected intercourse with her boyfriend was exculpatory for his client, because it suggested that she might have a motivation for fabrication.  Counsel asked that if the court refused to dismiss the case, that it order the Commonwealth to disclose the boyfriend's identity.  The trial court denied the motion to dismiss and did not order disclosure of the boyfriend's identity on the ground that the Massachusetts Rape Shield Law prohibits the introduction of a victim's sexual history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the last day of trial, Brewer presented expert testimony that he was not the source of the semen.  He then testified that when he found the victim and her father in the car, she was naked and her father's pants were down, thus suggesting that the father was the source of the semen.  The victim testified on rebuttal that she had had unprotected sex with her boyfriend suggesting that the semen was his.  Defense counsel objected, saying that he had asked for the boyfriend's name earlier and was now precluded from making a credibility argument.  The court declined to revisit the issue.  After trial, Brewer had blood samples from the boyfriend tested.  The results indicated that the boyfriend was not the source of the semen.  Brewer then filed a motion for a new trial based on this \"newly discovered\" evidence.  The motion was denied on the ground that the defendant had already presented expert testimony that he was not the source of the semen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brewer was convicted and sentenced to nine-to-twelve years' imprisonment for rape and three-to-five years for kidnapping, to be served concurrently.  He appealed his conviction to the Massachusetts Appeals Court.

In a one-and-a-half page opinion, the Appeals Court upheld Brewer's conviction:  \"Substantially for those reasons set out in the Commonwealth's brief and the trial judge's memorandum of decision in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial, we conclude that there is no basis for disturbing the defendant's convictions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brewer filed an application for leave to obtain further appellate review with the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.

The district court gave plenary review to the question of racial discrimination and relied solely on numbers to conclude that a prima facie case was established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Engaging in its own statistical analysis, the district court concluded that there was a pattern that demonstrated a statistical disparity sufficient to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination under Batson.   The district court noted that when Brewer first made a Batson objection, the prosecutor had exercised nine peremptories, four of which were used to excuse four out of six black venirepersons.  In doing this, the court found that the prosecutor used 44% of his strikes in the first round to excuse 66% of the black persons then impaneled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were no statistics available as to the racial composition of the venire which had been found to be unbiased after voir dire or the racial composition of Suffolk County from which the venire was drawn.  The district court, however, estimated that 15% of the entire venire was black based on the fact that out of a total of 45 potential jurors who had passed through the box, seven were black.  Thus, the court reasoned, the prosecutor's strike rate against blacks in the first round (66%) was several times larger than the population of the blacks in the venire (15%).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the new standard of review outlined in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. 104-132 (\"AEDPA\"), the court found that the estimated numbers based on the \"pattern\" of strikes alone constituted a prima facie case of discrimination under \"clearly established\" Supreme Court law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then ordered an evidentiary hearing to allow the state to offer nondiscriminatory reasons for the challenges.  The state was unable, seven years after the trial, to produce any evidence.  The prosecutor said that he could not recall the reasons and had long since destroyed his trial notes.  The court granted the writ on Batson grounds on September 30, 1996, but stayed its issuance to allow for an appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seeking clarification, the state returned to Suffolk County Superior Court and filed a request for the original trial judge to explain her rulings on Brewer's Batson claims.  After conducting a hearing, the trial judge issued a memorandum stating that she had rejected the initial Batson claim on timeliness grounds.  Because the excused potential jurors had already left the courtroom, she was unable to observe their races and demeanors at the time of the objection.  She was therefore unable to make a meaningful evaluation of the defendant's claim that the prosecutor had made race-based peremptory challenges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this response, the state filed a motion for reconsideration in the federal district court, arguing that habeas review was barred by procedural default.  The court found the state's new argument unpersuasive and denied the motion, holding that there was no independent and adequate state ground.  The Commonwealth appeals, arguing, inter alia, that the district court erred in concluding that there was no procedural default on the Batson claim.  Additionally, Brewer contends on appeal that the government's failure to disclose, in a timely fashion, the boyfriend's identity deprived him of the opportunity to counter the \"boyfriend story\" in violation of his constitutional rights to a fair trial and due process of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>The Batson Claim and Limits on Federal Habeas Review Independent And Adequate State Grounds</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state asserts that review is barred under the \"independent and adequate state ground\" doctrine.

The order of the state judge denying the new trial motion may appear at first to be somewhat ambiguous because it starts with a statement that the court found no support for the contention that the Commonwealth had improperly excluded blacks from the jury.  However, the part of the state court opinion dealing with the jury selection procedures only concerns the challenge by the prosecution of the fifth black juror.  There is no discussion of defendant's earlier objection.

Brewer argues that requiring a defendant to object to a challenge on the ground of a pattern of racially exclusionary strikes before the pattern emerges raises constitutional issues.  For example, he says he should not have had to object to the strike of the first black juror on the ground of a pattern of racial discrimination if he did not see the pattern until the strike of the fourth black juror.  If that were what happened in this case, we would have considerable sympathy for the argument.  But that is not what happened.

At the time of the objection, those jurors had already been excused and had left the courtroom.  There is no indication (because defense counsel created no record) of where in the sequence of the prosecutor's nine peremptory challenges these four fell or whether the court or counsel had a clear memory of who those jurors were.

The government believed the boyfriend was the semen donor and that this evidence, in itself, was incriminatory rather than exculpatory.\"   The rule in Brady does not typically apply unless the prosecutor has knowledge of the exculpatory evidence.
