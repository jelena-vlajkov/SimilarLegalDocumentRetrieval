Appellants  challenge a  bankruptcy court\r                    Per Curiam.\r                              \n\norder,  affirmed on  intermediate appeal  to the  district court,\n\nauthorizing the chapter 11 trustee to sell substantially  all the\n\ncorporate  debtor's assets.   As  appellants neither  alleged nor\n\nestablished  cognizable  injury  from  the  challenged  order, we\n\naffirm the district court judgment. \n\n          The present litigation has survived the demise of Wynco\n\nDistributors,  Inc. (\"Wynco\"  or  \"debtor\"),  a corporation  once\n\nclosely held  by the Wynn family.   Paul, Henry, Albert and Irene\n\nWynn were  beneficiaries of  the Wynn Family  Trust [hereinafter:\n\n\"Family Trust\"], the sole  shareholder in Wynco.  Paul  and Irene\n\nWynn  served on the  Wynco board of  directors.  Paul,  Henry and\n\nAlbert Wynn  were the  designated trustees  of the Family  Trust.\n\nPaul  alone was authorized to vote Family Trust shares in matters\n\naffecting Wynco.\n\n          On December 17, 1990, Henry and Albert Wynn, appellants\n\nin  the   present  action,  unsuccessfully  brought   suit  in  a\n\nMassachusetts  court  to relieve  Paul  Wynn  as a  trustee,  for\n\nalleged mental  incompetence.   Nevertheless, ten days  after the\n\nstate superior  court ruled against  them, Henry and  Albert pur-\n\nportedly removed  Paul as a  trustee and installed  themselves as\n\nofficers  and directors of Wynco.1   In response,  Paul and Irene\n                    \r                              \n\n     1Ultimately, the  superior court  concluded  that Henry  and\nAlbert Wynn had no  authority to displace Paul  as a trustee  and\nthat Paul possessed the  requisite authority under  Massachusetts\nlaw  to initiate these chapter 11 proceedings in behalf of Wynco.\nWynn v.  Wynn, No. 90-03357 (Mass. Super.  Ct. 1990).  The Massa-\r                       \nchusetts  Appeals Court  affirmed in  Wynn  v. Wynn,  No. 93-P-29\r                                                             \n(Mass. App. Ct. 1994).\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nWynn promptly filed  a chapter 11 petition in  behalf of Wynco in\n\nthe  United   States  Bankruptcy   Court  for  the   District  of\n\nMassachusetts.\n\n          Henry  and Albert  correctly point  out on  appeal that\n\nthey challenged the Wynco chapter  11 petition in the  bankruptcy\n\ncourt,  based on  their allegations  that Paul  was incompetent.2\n\nThey also  insist, however, that Paul's  alleged incompetency was\n\nfraudulently  concealed from the bankruptcy court.  We can accord\n\nno weight to the latter contention  in light of the fact that the\n\nbankruptcy  court     though  by appellants'  own admission  well\n\naware of their allegations of incompetency    elected to defer to\n\nthe state court on the matter.   See supra p. 2.  There can  have\r                                                    \n\nbeen no  actual concealment  of Paul's alleged  incompetency from\n\nthe bankruptcy court, which was  apprised of the allegations  and\n\nappropriately elected to defer to the state court.  \n\n          The  sole  remaining issue,  to which  we now  turn, is\n\nwhether appellants alleged  or established any cognizable  injury\n\nresulting  from the  challenged sale.   Eleven  months after  the\n\nchapter 11 petition was filed, no reorganization plan having been\n\nsubmitted,  the chapter  11 trustee  proposed to  sell the  Wynco\n                    \r                              \n\n     2The record  reflects that  the matter of  Paul's competency\nwas raised at a  bankruptcy court hearing on the  debtor's motion\nto restrain and enjoin appellants from operating Wynco; in appel-\nlants' motion for leave to  appeal the bankruptcy court's  denial\nof their motion to dismiss the chapter 11 petition; and in appel-\nlants'  district court  appeal  from the  bankruptcy court  order\nauthorizing the  sale of  Wynco's assets.   Significantly, though\nnot  surprisingly in light of the record below, no allegations of\nfraud on the court were ever raised by appellants prior  to their\r                            \nappeal  to the  district court  from  the bankruptcy  court order\napproving the sale of assets.  \n\n                                3\r\r\n\nbusiness as a going concern, together with substantially all  its\n\nassets,  to Susan Wynn, Paul Wynn's daughter, for $100,000.3  The\n\ntrustee projected  that the $100,000  in cash generated  from the\n\nsale to Susan  Wynn, together  with $164,000 in  cash already  on\n\nhand  and  the anticipated  proceeds  from  $210,000 in  accounts\n\nreceivable retained  by the debtor estate, would enable all Wynco\n\ncreditors  and  costs  of  administration (a  combined  total  of\n\n$395,000)  to be satisfied  in full.   Any surplus was  to be re-\n\ntained  to  cover  the  costs of  defending  against  appellants'\n\nchallenges to the order of sale.\n\n          Appellants advanced four arguments in support  of their\n\nopposition to the  sale.  First, the sale  would be premature, as\n\nthe  state court had not yet decided  who was entitled to control\n\nWynco.   Second, the  purchaser was an insider.   Third, the pur-\n\nchaser chilled the sale,  deflating the purchase price.   Fourth,\n\nthe proposed sale  would contravene  chapter 11  by permitting  a\n\nsale of going-concern assets  without the protections afforded by\n\na  disclosure statement or a  plan of reorganization.   See Bank-\r                                                                     \n\nruptcy Code    1106, 1121-25, 11 U.S.C.    1106, 1121-25 (1993). \n\n          The bankruptcy court rejected these contentions for the\n\nfollowing  reasons.  First, the case had been pending longer than\n\nmost bankruptcy cases,  and awaiting a state court decision would\n\nnecessitate further,  indefinite delay.  Second,  the purchaser's\n                    \r                              \n\n     3The  appraised  value  was  between  $69,000  and  $86,500.\nExcluded from  the sale were Wynco  accounts receivable predating\nthe  October 1,  1991 sale  agreement, approximating  $210,000 in\nface  amount, which were to  be collected for  the benefit of the\ndebtor estate either by the buyer or the trustee. \n\n                                4\r\r\n\n\"insider\"  status had  been fully  disclosed.   Third, appellants\n\nfailed to present competent evidence  (or to pursue discovery) in\n\nsupport of their allegation that the purchaser chilled  the sale.\n\nFourth,  the court found that the chapter 11 trustee had complied\n\nwith Bankruptcy Code   1106, 11 U.S.C.   1106.4    \n\n          Undeterred, appellants reiterate their contentions that\n\nthe  chapter 11 proceedings amounted to a fraud on the bankruptcy\n\ncourt because Paul  Wynn was incompetent to initiate  the chapter\n\n11  proceedings  and  his  incompetency was  concealed  from  the\n\nbankruptcy  court  by Paul's  attorneys  and by  Susan  Wynn, the\n\npurchaser.   As  noted above,  see supra  p. 3,  their ostensible\r                                                  \n\nconcern for  the integrity of  the chapter  11 proceedings  rings\n\nhollow.  Furthermore,  appellants neither point  to error in  the\r                                                                   \n\nbankruptcy court rulings relating to the order of sale, see supra\r                                                                           \n\npp. 4-5, nor allege  any cognizable injury sustained as  a conse-\n\nquence  of  the order  of sale.    Finally, absent  any developed\n\nargumentation as to  appellate standing, whatever potential  harm\n\nmight conceivably  be visited  upon appellants as  minority Wynco\n\nshareholders is  too speculative to support  the required showing\n\nthat appellants  are \"aggrieved parties.\"  See  In re El San Juan\r                                                                           \n\nHotel, 809 F.2d 151, 154 (1st Cir. 1987).\r               \n\n                    \r                              \n\n     4In the latter regard,  the court found  that it was in  the\nbest interests of creditors to continue to operate Wynco  pending\nsale, in order to  capitalize on its going-concern value,  rather\nthan suspend business operations and liquidate the remnants under\nchapter  7.    Moreover, the  court  concluded  that the  trustee\nfulfilled his responsibility under  Bankruptcy Code   1106(5), 11\nU.S.C.    1106(5), by  indicating  his intention  to convert  the\nproceedings to chapter 7 upon consummation of the sale.  \n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          The  district  court  judgment is  affirmed;  costs  to\r                                                                           \n\nappellee. \r                  \n\n                                6\r\r\n",

As appellants neither alleged nor established cognizable injury from the challenged order, we affirm the district court judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present litigation has survived the demise of Wynco Distributors, Inc.  (\"Wynco\" or \"debtor\"), a corporation once closely held by the Wynn family.  Paul, Henry, Albert and Irene Wynn were beneficiaries of the Wynn Family Trust [hereinafter:  \"Family Trust\"], the sole shareholder in Wynco.  Paul and Irene Wynn served on the Wynco board of directors.  Paul, Henry and Albert Wynn were the designated trustees of the Family Trust.  Paul alone was authorized to vote Family Trust shares in matters affecting Wynco.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 17, 1990, Henry and Albert Wynn, appellants in the present action, unsuccessfully brought suit in a Massachusetts court to relieve Paul Wynn as a trustee, for alleged mental incompetence.  Nevertheless, ten days after the state superior court ruled against them, Henry and Albert purportedly removed Paul as a trustee and installed themselves as officers and directors of Wynco.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In response, Paul and Irene Wynn promptly filed a chapter 11 petition in behalf of Wynco in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henry and Albert correctly point out on appeal that they challenged the Wynco chapter 11 petition in the bankruptcy court, based on their allegations that Paul was incompetent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  They also insist, however, that Paul's alleged incompetency was fraudulently concealed from the bankruptcy court.  We can accord no weight to the latter contention in light of the fact that the bankruptcy court ---- though by appellants' own admission well aware of their allegations of incompetency ---- elected to defer to the state court on the matter.  See supra p. 2. There can have been no actual concealment of Paul's alleged incompetency from the bankruptcy court, which was apprised of the allegations and appropriately elected to defer to the state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sole remaining issue, to which we now turn, is whether appellants alleged or established any cognizable injury resulting from the challenged sale.  Eleven months after the chapter 11 petition was filed, no reorganization plan having been submitted, the chapter 11 trustee proposed to sell the Wynco business as a going concern, together with substantially all its assets, to Susan Wynn, Paul Wynn's daughter, for $100,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The trustee projected that the $100,000 in cash generated from the sale to Susan Wynn, together with $164,000 in cash already on hand and the anticipated proceeds from $210,000 in accounts receivable retained by the debtor estate, would enable all Wynco creditors and costs of administration (a combined total of $395,000) to be satisfied in full.  Any surplus was to be retained to cover the costs of defending against appellants' challenges to the order of sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants advanced four arguments in support of their opposition to the sale.  First, the sale would be premature, as the state court had not yet decided who was entitled to control Wynco.  Second, the purchaser was an insider.  Third, the purchaser chilled the sale, deflating the purchase price.  Fourth, the proposed sale would contravene chapter 11 by permitting a sale of going-concern assets without the protections afforded by a disclosure statement or a plan of reorganization.  See Bankruptcy Code Secs. 1106, 1121- 25, 11 U.S.C. Secs. 1106, 1121-25 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court rejected these contentions for the following reasons.  First, the case had been pending longer than most bankruptcy cases, and awaiting a state court decision would necessitate further, indefinite delay.  Second, the purchaser's \"insider\" status had been fully disclosed.  Third, appellants failed to present competent evidence (or to pursue discovery) in support of their allegation that the purchaser chilled the sale.  Fourth, the court found that the chapter 11 trustee had complied with Bankruptcy Code Sec. 1106, 11 U.S.C. Sec. 1106.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undeterred, appellants reiterate their contentions that the chapter 11 proceedings amounted to a fraud on the bankruptcy court because Paul Wynn was incompetent to initiate the chapter 11 proceedings and his incompetency was concealed from the bankruptcy court by Paul's attorneys and by Susan Wynn, the purchaser.  As noted above, see supra p. 3, their ostensible concern for the integrity of the chapter 11 proceedings rings hollow.  Furthermore, appellants neither point to error in the bankruptcy court rulings relating to the order of sale, see supra pp. 4-5, nor allege any cognizable injury sustained as a consequence of the order of sale.  Finally, absent any developed argumentation as to appellate standing, whatever potential harm might conceivably be visited upon appellants as minority Wynco shareholders is too speculative to support the required showing that appellants are \"aggrieved parties.\"  See In re El San Juan Hotel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481639\"><a href=\"/opinion/481639/in-re-el-san-juan-hotel-debtor-appeal-of-hector-m-rodriguez-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span>, 154 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgment is affirmed;  costs to appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Ultimately, the superior court concluded that Henry and Albert Wynn had no authority to displace Paul as a trustee and that Paul possessed the requisite authority under Massachusetts law to initiate these chapter 11 proceedings in behalf of Wynco.
