Petitioner  Leos Kubec, a  native and\n                    \n\ncitizen of Czechoslovakia, has filed this petition for review\n\nof the  decision of the  Board of Immigration  Appeals (BIA).\n\nThe  BIA  dismissed  his  appeal  from  the  decision  of the\n\nimmigration judge as untimely.\n\n                              I.\n                               \n\n          Petitioner  entered  the United  States,  in August\n\n1989,  as  a  nonimmigrant   visitor  for  pleasure;  he  was\n\npermitted  to  remain here  until  February  1990.   However,\n\npetitioner  never  left  this  country.   As  a  result,  the\n\nImmigration  and Naturalization Service (INS) issued an order\n\nto  show cause  why petitioner  should not  be deported.   In\n\nresponse,  petitioner filed applications for political asylum\n\nand withholding of deportation.\n\n          A deportation  hearing was held on  March 21, 1991.\n\nPetitioner admitted  the facts  in the  show cause order  and\n\nconceded deportability.   At  the conclusion of  the hearing,\n\nthe immigration  judge rendered  an oral decision;  he denied\n\nthe  applications  for  political asylum  and  withholding of\n\ndeportation.  The judge determined that petitioner had failed\n\nto demonstrate that  he would  be persecuted or  had a  well-\n\nfounded fear of  persecution if  returned to  Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe immigration  judge  did grant  petitioner's  request  for\n\nvoluntary departure in lieu  of deportation.  See 8  U.S.C.  \n                                                 \n\n1254(e).  The judge also informed  petitioner that any appeal\n\nto the BIA had to be filed by April 1, 1991.\n\n                             II.\n                               \n\n          8  C.F.R.    3.38(b)  provides that  the notice  of\n\nappeal \"shall  be filed  with the  Office of  the Immigration\n\nJudge  having  administrative  control  over  the  Record  of\n\nProceeding within ten (10) calendar days after service of the\n\ndecision.\"  A  petitioner must  use a specific  form (at  the\n\ntime, designated as Form  EOIR-26) for the notice of  appeal.\n\n20 C.F.R.   3.3(a).  Further, \"a notice of appeal . . . shall\n\nbe  accompanied  by the  appropriate  fee  specified by,  and\n\nremitted in  accordance with,  the provisions  of    103.7 of\n\nthis chapter.\"   See  id.    3.3(b).    Thus, to  perfect  an\n                         \n\nappeal, both Form EOIR-26 and a fee receipt must be presented\n\nto the Office of the Immigration Judge.\n\n          Section 103.7(a) provides, in relevant part:\n\n          Any fee relating to any  Executive Office\n          for  Immigration Review  proceeding shall\n          be  paid to, and accepted by, any Service\n          office   authorized   to   accept   fees.\n          Payment  of  any fee  under  this section\n          does   not   constitute  filing   of  the\n          document   with   the   Office   of   the\n          Immigration  Judge.    The Service  shall\n          return  to  the  payer  at  the  time  of\n          payment both the receipt for any fee paid\n          and any documents submitted with the fee.\n\nWhere  an appeal is not  taken within the  10-day period, the\n\nright to appeal is lost.  See Da Cruz v. INS, 4 F.3d 721, 722\n                                            \n\n(9th Cir. 1993);  Matter of G.Z., 5 I. &amp; N Dec. 295 (1953); 1\n                                \n\n                             -3-\n\nC.

The  letter  is\n\naddressed to the Office of the Immigration Judge and is dated\n\nMarch  22, 1991.  Form EOIR-26 is date-stamped as having been\n\nreceived on  March 29, 1991.   As for the filing  of the fee,\n\nthere  is  no  record  evidence.    However,  petitioner  has\n\nappended to  his brief a  copy of  an INS  fee receipt  dated\n\nApril 5, 1991.  According to the order of the BIA, the appeal\n\nwas not perfected until April 9, 1991.  What exactly happened\n\nbetween March 29th and April 9th is not clear.\n\n          Petitioner's position is that  circumstances beyond\n\nhis  control prevented  the timely  completion of  the appeal\n\nprocess.  Although not  entirely clear, petitioner avers that\n\nthe  INS did not comply with    103.7(a); that is, it did not\n\nproduce  a receipt on  the day  the fee  was paid.   Further,\n\ndespite  being  in daily  contact  with  the INS,  petitioner\n\nasserts  that   a  fee  receipt  for   hand-delivery  to  the\n\nimmigration judge could not be obtained until after the April\n\n1st deadline.  In  fact, according to petitioner, all  of the\n\npapers  remained in the possession of the INS until April 9th\n\n                             -4-\n\n-- the date the appeal was perfected.  Petitioner nonetheless\n\navers that he is in \"literal\" compliance with the regulations\n\nbecause  he \"initiated\"  his  appeal in  a  timely manner  by\n\nfiling Form EOIR-26 with the Office of the Immigration  Judge\n\non March 29th.  \n\n          The INS argues that  petitioner's claim that he was\n\npersonally  involved in the filing  of the appeal and payment\n\nof the fee is not  well supported.  It points out that  it is\n\nnot clear exactly  who filed  the papers at  the INS  office.\n\nWhile  petitioner  implies  that  he  personally  handled the\n\nappeal process, the notice of appeal was sent from the office\n\nof  petitioner's attorney.    Moreover, the  fee receipt  was\n\nmailed, not to petitioner, but to counsel.\n\n          Given the conflicts between petitioner's assertions\n\nand  what  the   record  reveals,   petitioner's  vague   and\n\nconclusory allegations are insufficient to sustain  a finding\n\nthat his appeal  was timely.   Thus, we  cannot say that  the\n\nBIA's  determination was  not supported  by the record.   The\n\npetition for review is therefore denied.\n                                       \n\n                             -5-\n",
