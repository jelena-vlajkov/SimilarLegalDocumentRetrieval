The main question for decision\r                    TORRUELLA, Chief Judge\r                                          \n\nis whether a United  States District Court has the power to adopt\n\na local rule that requires federal prosecutors to obtain judicial\n\napproval  before they serve a  subpoena on an  attorney to compel\n\nevidence concerning a client.   The United States District  Court\n\nfor New Hampshire held  that the federal district court  in Rhode\n\nIsland  has the power to adopt such  a rule with respect to trial\n\nsubpoenas, but does not have  the power to do so with  respect to\n\ngrand jury subpoenas.  For the reasons stated herein, we conclude\n\nthat  the United States District  Court for Rhode  Island has the\n\npower to adopt the  local rule in question, both with  respect to\n\ntrial and grand jury subpoenas.  We therefore affirm in part  and\n\nreverse in part.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\n\n          To fully appreciate the important interests at stake in\n\nthis case, it  is necessary briefly to review some  of the recent\n\nhistory leading to this lawsuit.\n\nI.  Attorney-Subpoenas\r          I.  Attorney-Subpoenas\r                                \n\n          Until recently, federal  prosecutors rarely  subpoenaed\n\nattorneys to  compel testimony relating  to their clients.   This\n\npractice  changed in the 1980s as  the federal government stepped\n\nup its  fight against organized crime  and narcotics trafficking.\n\nMost significantly, Congress passed  several new federal statutes\n\nwhich, in the eyes of federal prosecutors, make attorneys fertile\n\nground for eliciting incriminating information about  the targets\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nof federal investigations and prosecutions.1\n\n          Because service of a subpoena on an attorney implicates\n\nthe attorney-client relationship, and thus  raises ethical issues\n\nfor prosecutors,  the United States Department  of Justice issued\n\nguidelines  for  federal  prosecutors  seeking  to  subpoena   an\n\nattorney.

The instances of\n\nfederal  prosecutors  subpoenaing  attorneys  to  compel evidence\n\nregarding theirclients have, nevertheless, continuedto increase.3\n                    \r                              \n\n2   The  guidelines  require federal  prosecutors  to obtain  the\napproval  of the  Assistant  Attorney General  in  charge of  the\nCriminal Division prior to issuing a subpoena on counsel.  Before\napproving  a  subpoena to  an  attorney,  the Assistant  Attorney\nGeneral  must  find that  the  information  is  necessary for  an\ninvestigation or prosecution, unavailable from other sources, not\nprotected by privilege, that the  subpoena is narrowly drawn, and\nthat the need for the information outweighs any potential adverse\neffects on the attorney-client relationship.  Id.\r                                                          \n\n3  In  the first year that  the Department of  Justice Guidelines\nwere in  effect, July 18, 1985  to July 31, 1986,  the Department\napproved 411 attorney subpoenas, an average of  33 per month.  In\nthe period from  March 1987 through October 1987,  the Department\nrejected only ten requests  for attorney subpoenas, slightly more\nthan  one per  month.  Max  D.

In February 1987, the\n\nRules Committee published a list of  proposed rules and solicited\n\ncomment from  all members  of the  Rhode Island  Bar.   The Rhode\n\nIsland Supreme  Court later  held a  public hearing  and received\n\nadditional  comments on the proposed rules.  On November 1, 1988,\n\nthe  Rhode Island  Supreme Court  adopted the  proposed Rules  of\n\nProfessional  Conduct as  an  amendment to  Rhode Island  Supreme\n\nCourt Rule 47.

The state court  invited briefs from  the United States\n\nAttorney  and interested  members of  the  Rhode Island  Bar and,\n\nafter a hearing, denied the petition to amend.

The  question remains,\n\nhowever, whether, considering the special role assigned the grand\n\njury in our justice system, Local Rule 3.8(f) regulates a subject\n\nmatter beyond the district court's rule-making authority. \n\n          A.  The Special Role of the Grand Jury\r                    A.  The Special Role of the Grand Jury\r                                                          \n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\n          The grand  jury occupies a unique place  in our justice\n\nsystem.   It is  not assigned by  the Constitution to  any of the\n\nthree branches of government, and therefore acts independently of\n\neach.   The Supreme Court  has explained: \"[T]he  whole theory of\n\nthe [grand  jury's] function is that  it belongs to no  branch of\n\nthe institutional  government, serving  as a  kind  of buffer  or\n\nreferee between the Government and the people.\"  United States v.\r                                                                        \n\nWilliams,     U.S.   , 112 S.  Ct. 1735, 1742 (1992).   The grand\r                  \n\njury's \"specialness\" is manifested in five ways pertinent to this\n\ncase: 1) its  independence from the  court's supervision; 2)  its\n\nbroad  investigative  powers;  3)  the  presumption  of  validity\n\naccorded its subpoenas; 4) the secrecy of its proceedings; and 5)\n\nits  general freedom from procedural detours and delays.  See id.\r                                                                          \n\n(citations omitted);  United States  v. R.

They contend that Local Rule 3.8(f), therefore,\n\nregulates  a subject  matter  beyond the  district court's  rule-\n\nmaking authority  because it  \"directly  contravenes the  central\n\nprinciples  underlying the  essential  role and  function of  the\n\ngrand jury in the federal criminal justice system.\"  The district\n\ncourt  agreed, holding  that \"the  district court  cannot enforce\n\nLocal Rule 3.8(f) because  it assumes a power that the court does\n\nnot  have  --  the  power  to fundamentally  alter  the  historic\n\nrelationship between the grand  jury and its constituting court.\"\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nAlmond, 852 F.

As such,\r                                            \n\nthe Rule  regulates the conduct of attorneys appearing before the\n\ncourt  -- a  power well within  the limits of  a federal district\n\ncourt's rule-making authority --  and not the grand jury  per se.\r                                                                          \n\nSecond, we  think the  district court's  reliance on  Williams is\r                                                                        \n\nmisplaced.   Finally, any incidental  effect the Rule  has on the\n\ngrand jury is minimal, and  outweighed by the important interests\n\nserved by the rule.    \n\n          B.  Effect of Local Rule on Grand Jury Functions\r                    B.

The plain language of the Rule\n\ndemonstrates that it  applies to \"[t]he prosecutor in  a criminal\n\ncase.\"   As we pointed out  in Klubock I,  concerning a virtually\r                                                  \n\nidentical ethical rule:\n\n            PF 15 is not  aimed at grand jury action.\r                                                       \n            It   deals   solely  with   prosecutorial\n            conduct in the prosecutor's capacity as a\n            member  of the bar.  If, in fact, a grand\n            jury   acting    independently   of   any\n            prosecutorial influence issues a subpoena\n            against    an    attorney/witness,    the\n            attorney/witness must honor  it, or  move\n            to quash  the subpoena in  an appropriate\n            manner.   Such  independent action  by  a\n            grand jury  has  no relevance  to  PF  15\n            because  none  of  the  ethical  concerns\n            previously mentioned are implicated.\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nKlubock I, 832 F.2d at 658.  The distinction is critical because,\r                   \n\nalthough the potential damage to the attorney-client relationship\n\nexists  regardless of  who seeks  the subpoena,  the attorney-to-\n\nattorney ethical concerns  that the Rule was designed to mitigate\r                          \n\nare  not implicated  when the  grand jury,  acting independently,\n\nseeks to subpoena  counsel.11   The Rule, as  written, acts  only\n\nas a prophylactic  aimed at perceived  deleterious action by  one\n\nlitigating attorney against opposing counsel.           \n\n          Nor  does  the  Rule  affect  the  grand  jury's  broad\n\ninvestigative  powers  -- often  described  as  the grand  jury's\n\n\"right  to every man's evidence.\"   Branzburg v.

It merely authorizes district courts to reject\n\na prosecutor's attorney-subpoena application for  the traditional\n\nreasons justifying the  quashing of  a subpoena --  that is,  the\n\nsubpoena  request  would  be denied  if  the  evidence sought  is\n\nprotected  by   a   constitutional,  common-law,   or   statutory\n\nprivilege,  or, the  court  determines that  compliance with  the\n\nsubpoena  would  be  \"unreasonable   or  oppressive.\"    See  id.\r                                                                          \n\n(citations  omitted); In re Grand Jury Matters, 751 F.2d at 17-18\r                                                        \n\n                    \r                              \n\n11   We  have noted  that,  although they  are  issued under  the\ndistrict court's name and for the grand jury, \"[t]hese  subpoenas\nare 'in  fact almost universally instrumentalities  of the United\nStates  Attorney's  office  or   some  other  department  of  the\nexecutive  branch.'\"  In  re Grand Jury  Matters, 751  F.2d at 16\r                                                          \n(quoting  In re Grand Jury Proceedings  (Schofield), 486 F.2d 85,\r                                                             \n90 (3d Cir. 1973)).

Therefore, it does\n\nnot disturb the grand jury's broad investigative powers.13\n\n          In effect, Local Rule  3.8(f) merely changes the timing\n\nwith respect to motions to quash in recognition of  the fact that\n\nservice itself of an attorney-subpoena seeking to compel evidence\n\nconcerning a client may cause irreparable damage to the attorney-\n\nclient  relationship.

From  the  moment that  the  subpoena is  served  on\n\ncounsel,  until the issue of its validity is resolved, the client\n\nresides  in a state  of suspended animation,  not knowing whether\n\nhis  attorney will testify against him and perhaps be required to\n\nwithdraw his  representation.

Indeed, the Rhode Island Rules of\nProfessional  Conduct  provide  that  the \"Comments  do  not  add\nobligations to the  Rules but provide guidance  for practicing in\ncompliance with the Rules.\"  The Rhode Island Supreme Court Rules\nalso provide that \"the  Comments are intended for interpretation,\nbut  the text  of  each Rule  is  authoritative.\"   Rhode  Island\nSupreme Court Rule  47.

That  the defense  counsel's\n\nadversary  can  bring about  these  consequences raises  manifest\r                   \n\nethical  concerns,  properly  addressed  by a  rule  directed  at\n\nregulating the attorney-to-attorney relationship.\n\n          We  also reject  plaintiffs' argument  that Local  Rule\n\n3.8(f)  contravenes  the   historic  \"secrecy\"   of  grand   jury\n\ninvestigations.   Nothing in the  text of the  Rule prohibits the\n\nfiling of attorney-subpoena applications  to the court under seal\n\nor in  camera.  Nor does the Rule prohibit the court from holding\r                       \n\nan ex parte, in camera hearing.  District courts routinely use in\r                                                                           \n\ncamera  procedures to maintain grand  jury secrecy in the context\r                \n\nof  post-service motions to quash.  See R. Enterprises, Inc., 498\r                                                                      \n\nU.S. at 302.  Moreover, because the grounds upon which a district\n\ncourt  may reject an  attorney-subpoena application  mirror those\n\nfor quashing  a  subpoena, the  prosecutor  will be  required  to\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\ndivulge no  more information  with  respect to  the grand  jury's\n\ninvestigation than it would in responding to a motion to quash.14\n\n          Finally, there  is nothing in  the text  of Local  Rule\n\n3.8(f)  which would subject the  grand jury to unusual procedural\n\ndelays or detours.   As  noted, the Rule  only affects  subpoenas\n\nsought  by prosecutors for use at  the grand jury proceeding.  It\n\nis  not applicable  to subpoenas  sought by  a grand  jury acting\n\nindependently.  It  therefore will not usually have  any delaying\n\neffect  on  the grand  jury's  investigation.   Furthermore,  any\n\nprocedural  delay or detour which does result would be minimal --\n\npresumably no greater than that caused by a traditional motion to\n\nquash a subpoena issued  at the grand  jury stage.  As  explained\n\nbelow, we think any  minimal delay is outweighed by  the benefits\n\nof the Rule.\n\n          We made many of these points in Klubock I.

Supra n.12.   District court\r                                                    \njudges will determine, based on their experience and professional\njudgment, the best way to comply with the Rule and maintain grand\njury secrecy.   In some  cases an in  camera adversarial  hearing\r                                                      \nmight  be  appropriate and  in  others it  might  not.   This, of\ncourse, is the  kind of decision district court  judges routinely\nmake in the exercise of their discretion.\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\n          Williams held  that a district court does  not have the\r                            \n\npower  to  dismiss  an  otherwise valid  indictment  because  the\n\ngovernment failed to disclose substantial exculpatory evidence to\n\nthe grand jury.   In doing so, the Court  announced the following\n\nprinciples, upon which the district court relied in striking down\n\nLocal Rule 3.8(f) as applied to grand jury subpoenas.\n\n               These  authorities  suggest  that  any\n            power federal courts may have to fashion,\n            on  their own initiative,  rules of grand\n            jury procedure is a very limited one, not\n            remotely  comparable  to  the power  they\n            maintain over their own proceedings.

Citing  the history of  the grand jury, both  in England\n\nand  the United  States, the  Williams Court  explained that  the\r                                                \n\ngrand jury sits  in order to asses  whether there is an  adequate\n\nbasis for bringing  a criminal charge,  rather than to  determine\n\nguilt  or innocence.    Therefore, \"requiring  the prosecutor  to\n\npresent  exculpatory evidence  as  well  as inculpatory  evidence\n\nwould  alter the  grand jury's  historical role,  transforming it\r                                                                           \n\nfrom an  accusatory  to an  adjudicatory  body.\"   Id.  (emphasis\r                                                               \n\nadded).\n\n          It can  hardly be  said  that Local  Rule 3.8(f)  would\n\n\"alter  the grand  jury's historic  role\" in  such a  fundamental\n\nfashion.  It certainly does not transform the grand jury  from an\n\naccusatory to an  adjudicatory body.   Indeed, it  has no  effect\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nwhatsoever  on the  grand jury's  accusatory role.   Nor  does it\n\nalter  the traditional  relationships between  prosecutor, court,\n\nand grand jury.  As we have noted, regulation of attorney conduct\n\nis a  traditional role  for  the court  -- one  for  which it  is\n\nparticularly well positioned and suited, and one  which has never\n\nbeen  considered within the purview of the grand jury.  Moreover,\n\nthe  Rule has no effect  on the evidence  ultimately presented by\n\nthe  government.  It merely allows the court to determine, before\n\nan attorney-subpoena is  served, and the damage  to the attorney-\n\nclient  relationship  caused, whether  grounds exist  which would\n\nrender the subpoena  subject to an  order to  quash.  Unlike  the\n\nsituation  in Williams,  Local  Rule 3.8(f)  does not  affect the\r                                \n\ntraditional  equation upon  which the  grand jury  deliberates to\n\nassess whether there is an  adequate basis for bringing  criminal\n\ncharges.\n\n          We  think Williams  is clearly  distinguishable on  the\r                                      \n\nabove grounds alone.  We note in addition, however, that Williams\r                                                                           \n\ninvolved  the use  of a  federal court's  \"supervisory power\"  to\n\ndismiss  an  indictment,  while  this case  involves  a  district\r                 \n\ncourt's  power  merely  to  regulate  the  conduct  of  attorneys\n\nappearing before it.  The supervisory power derives from the need\n\nfor courts  \"to implement  a remedy  for violation of  recognized\n\nrights,  to  preserve  judicial  integrity  by  ensuring  that  a\n\nconviction rests on appropriate considerations validly before the\n\njury,  and .  . . to  deter illegal  conduct.\"   United States v.\r                                                                        \n\nHastings, 461  U.S.  499, 505  (1982)  (citations omitted).

See Theard  v. United States, 354 U.S. 278,\r                                                            \n\n281  (1957) (\"The  court's control  over a  lawyer's professional\n\nlife  derives  from his  relation  to the  responsibilities  of a\n\ncourt.\"); Goldfarb  v.

Thus,  the source\n\nand purpose of the two powers distinguishes them.\n\n          The  nature  and extent  of  the  power exercised  also\n\ndiffer.    When a  federal court  uses  its supervisory  power to\n\ndismiss an indictment it directly encroaches upon the fundamental\n\nrole  of the grand jury.   That power  is appropriately reserved,\n\ntherefore, for extremely limited circumstances.  See Bank of Nova\r                                                                           \n\nScotia v.

In contrast, the power of a court to regulate\n\nthe  conduct of  attorneys appearing  before it  is traditionally\n\ninvoked  only to impose a sanction, monetary or otherwise, on the\n\noffending party, or to  recommend disciplinary proceedings.

It stands  to reason that the  more severe the sanction,\n\nthe more extensive the  source of power needed to  impose it, and\n\nthe  more closely that power  must be circumscribed.   It follows\n\nthat the converse is also true.

Clients  rely\n\nextensively   on   their   attorneys'   judgment,   advice,   and\n\nprofessional  competence.      Moreover,  as   legal  rules   and\n\nobligations  become  more complex,  clients  are  forced to  rely\n\nincreasingly on their attorneys, thus elevating the importance of\n\nthe attorney-client relationship.\n\n          The relationship  between attorney and client  is often\n\nan  ongoing  one, built  upon  years of  professional  and social\n\ninteraction.   On  other  occasions it  arises  out of  a  single\n\nincident.   Sometimes  the  client and  attorney  have never  met\n\nbefore.  Although the dynamics of these relationships differ, the\n\nfundamental responsibilities of attorney  to client are the same.\n\nAttorneys  must   diligently  and  competently   represent  their\n\nclients'  interests, keep  their  clients'  confidences, and  not\n\nplace  themselves in  situations where  their interests  conflict\n\nwith   those   of   their    clients.15      To   fulfill   their\n                    \r                              \n\n15   See, e.g., Model Rules of  Professional Conduct Rule 1.1 (\"A\r                        \nlawyer  shall provide competent  representation[, which] requires\nthe  legal  knowledge,  skill,   thoroughness    and  preparation\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\nresponsibilities,  attorneys need information from their clients.\n\nIt  is necessary to the very foundation of our adversarial system\n\nof  justice  that  clients  feel  secure  in  divulging to  their\n\nattorneys  the facts  in their  possession, including  those that\n\nclients think might be incriminating.

We think  that Local Rule  3.8(f) serves  similar\n\ninterests   as   those  noted   in   Hickman,16   and  that   its\r                                                      \n\nprophylactic  nature  is  consistent  with  the  Supreme  Court's\n\nrecognition that the district  court's supervision over the grand\n\n                    \r                              \n\n16  In contrast to Hickman, of course, the Rule in this case does\r                                    \nnot  create new  substantive  law with  respect to  the attorney-\nclient privilege.

The district court in this case rejected\n\nthe  Baylson court's  reasoning  and conclusion  with respect  to\r                      \n\nRules 17 and 57.

As noted, district courts have the general\n\npower to adopt local  rules pursuant to Federal Rule  of Criminal\n\nProcedure 57, 28 U.S.C.   2071(a), and their inherent rule-making\n\nauthority.   It might be argued  that neither Rule 57,   2071(a),\n\nnor the court's inherent  rule-making power provide the necessary\n\nauthority  for  a  district  court to  regulate  this  particular\r                   \n\nsubject  matter,  but  this  inquiry is  entirely  separate  from\n\nwhether  the ethical  rule  is inconsistent  with  Rule 17.    By\r                                                     \n\npremising its consistency  analysis on whether a  federal rule or\n\nstatute provides the specific authority to adopt the  local rule,\n\nBaylson turned the proper  inquiry on its head --  evaluating the\r                 \n\nRule  as  if  local  rules  are  presumptively   invalid.    This\n\npresumption  is  wholly  unsupported.   See,  e.g.,  Colgrove  v.\r                                                                       \n\nBattin, 413 U.S. 149 (1973); Link, 370 U.S. 626 (1962).20\r                                           \n                    \r                              \n\n20  The district court rejected the Baylson court's analysis with\r                                                     \nrespect to Rule 17 for similar reasons.\n\n              By focusing on whether Rule 17 \"allows\"\n            a  district  court  to intervene  in  the\n            subpoena  process  prior to  service, the\n            Third Circuit essentially held that local\n            rules   cannot    authorize   pre-service\n            judicial  review where  Rule 17  does not\n            itself authorize this practice.  In other\n            words,  the  court  held that  Rule  17's\n            silence   with  respect   to  pre-service\n            judicial  review   rendered  local  rules\n            authorizing  this  practice  inconsistent\n            with  the  federal  rule.   I  reject the\n            interpretive   premise  because   it  too\n            narrowly   circumscribes   the   district\n            courts' rulemaking power.\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\n          The proper method for  determining whether a local rule\n\nis inconsistent with a  federal rule of procedure is  to inquire,\n\nfirst,  whether the  two  rules are  textually inconsistent  and,\n\nsecond, whether the  local rule subverts  the overall purpose  of\n\nthe federal rule.   See  Hawes v. Club  Ecuestre Comandante,  535\r                                                                     \n\nF.2d 140, 144 (1st Cir. 1976).\n\n          We agree with the district court that the two rules are\n\nnot textually inconsistent.   There is simply nothing in  Rule 17\n\nwhich prohibits  pre-service involvement in the  subpoena process\n\nby  the  district court  judge.21   Plaintiffs  do  not seriously\n\ncontest this  point but  argue, instead,  that Local  Rule 3.8(f)\n\ncontravenes the  \"underlying policy of  Rule 17\" to  maintain the\n\nhistoric  limits on  the court's  involvement in  the  grand jury\n\nsubpoena process.  Plaintiffs  maintain that Rule 17 purposefully\n\nconfines   the  court's   role   in  the   subpoena  process   to\n\n\"administrative  functions, sanctioning  refusals to  comply with\n\nsubpoenas,   and  quashing  or   modifying  document  subpoenas.\"\n\nTherefore, the argument  goes, Rule 17's failure  to address pre-\n\n                    \r                              \n\nAlmond, 852 F. Supp. at 84.\r                \n\n21  As the district court  noted, Local Rule 3.8(f) is  concerned\nonly with the service of subpoenas on attorneys, not the issuance\r                               \nof  subpoenas.   This is  not merely  a difference  in semantics.\nLocal  Rule 3.8(f)  is a  prophylactic rule  designed to  address\ncertain perceived  ethical concerns implicated by  the increasing\npractice of federal  prosecutors subpoenaing opposing  counsel to\ncompel  testimony  regarding  a  target client.    These  ethical\nconcerns  simply are not implicated by the issuance of a subpoena\nbecause,  until  the attorney  is served  with the  subpoena, the\nclient  has no  reason to  distrust or  feel uncertain  about his\nattorney's allegiance.  See  Klubock I, 832 F.2d 649  (noting the\r                                                \nsame with respect to PF 15).\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n\nservice judicial  intervention in the subpoena  process indicates\n\nan intention that there should be none.\n\n          The  Supreme Court  has indicated  that silence  in the\n\nfederal rules should not be interpreted as a prohibition on local\n\nrule-making authority.  In Colgrove, for example,  the Court held\r                                             \n\nthat a local rule  authorizing six-person juries for civil  cases\n\ndid  not conflict with former Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 48,\n\nwhich provided that  \"[t]the parties may stipulate that  the jury\n\nshall  consist  of  any number  less  than  twelve.\"   The  Court\n\nconcluded that  the two rules were not  inconsistent because Rule\n\n48 \"'deals only with  a stipulation by \"[t]he parties.\"   It does\r                                                               \n\nnot purport to prevent court rules which provide for civil juries\r                                            \n\nof reduced size.'\"   Colgrove, 413 U.S. at 164 (quoting Cooley v.\r                                                                        \n\nStrickland  Transportation  Co.,  459  F.2d 779,  784  (5th  Cir.\r                                         \n\n1972)).

See, e.g.,  Theard, 354 U.S. at 281-83 (inherent power of\r                                    \n\ndistrict  courts  to  promulgate  and  enforce  rules  concerning\n\ndisbarment of attorneys).   Local Rule  3.8(f) is a  prophylactic\n\nethical rule regulating the conduct of attorneys appearing before\n\nthe court.   Therefore, as in Link, a strong indication of intent\r                                            \n\nto abrogate is required.\n\n          There is nothing in  the text of Rule 17 to  suggest it\n\nwas intended to abrogate the power of a federal court to regulate\n\nthe  conduct  of   attorneys  appearing  before  it.    Nor  have\n\nplaintiffs  identified any  historical evidence  with  respect to\n\nRule 17 indicating that  it was intended to abrogate  this power.\n\nThe Supreme Court's  decision in  Miner v. Atlass,  363 U.S.  641\r                                                           \n\n(1960),  is instructive in this regard.   Miner held that a local\r                                                         \n\nrule authorizing discovery-deposition practice in admiralty cases\n\nwas beyond the rule-making authority of the admiralty court.  The\n\nCourt has since explained that the decision in Miner was based on\r                                                              \n\nthe fact that the Supreme Court itself had previously omitted the\n\nprecise discovery procedure from among the Civil Rules adopted as\n\npart of the Admiralty  Rules.  See  Colgrove, 413 U.S. at  163-64\r                                                      \n\n                    \r                              \n\n23  As the district  court noted, although there is no  procedure\nin Rule 17 for  quashing a testimonial subpoena, courts  have, on\ntheir own authority, extended the Rule's procedures regarding the\nquashing of document subpoenas to cover testimonial subpoenas.\n\n                               -37-\r\r\n\nn.23.   The Court explained: \"Miner held that this omission 'must\r                                             \n\nbe  taken  as an  advertent  declination  of the  opportunity  to\n\ninstitute the discovery-deposition procedure of  Civil Rule 26(a)\n\nthroughout  courts of admiralty.'\"   Id.

The court therefore  held that the local  rule was not\n\nconsistent  with the General Admiralty Rules.  Miner, 363 U.S. at\r                                                              \n\n647.

We  agree.   The\n\nanalysis supporting our  conclusion that Local  Rule 3.8(f) is  a\n\nvalid exercise of the  district court's rule-making authority, as\n\n                               -40-\r\r\n\napplied  to grand  jury subpoenas, applies  with even  more force\n\nwith  respect  to  trial  subpoenas.

Moreover,\r                                         \n\nbecause we conclude that  Local Rule 3.8(f), as applied  to grand\n\njury subpoenas, is not  inconsistent with either Rule 17  or Rule\n\n57 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 17, it follows that\n\nit  is  not inconsistent  with these  Rules  as applied  to trial\n\nsubpoenas.26   Plaintiffs  have presented  us with  no persuasive\n\nauthority  to  the  contrary.

We will briefly explain why.\n\n          The  district  court  held  that,  because  the federal\n\nversion  of Rule  3.8(f)  is invalid  as  applied to  grand  jury\n\nsubpoenas,  enforcing the  state version  of Rule  3.8(f) against\n\nfederal prosecutors practicing in federal court would violate the\n\n                    \r                              \n\n26    As the  district court  noted,  because \"Rule  17  does not\ndifferentiate between grand jury and trial subpoenas, but instead\nsets out the basic  mechanics governing all types  of subpoenas,\"\nthe analysis with respect to Rule 17 \"applies with equal force to\nboth applications of Local Rule 3.8(f).\"  Almond, 852 F.

The district\n\ncourt's  Supremacy Clause  analysis was  premised on  its holding\n\nthat  the federal version  of the  Rule is  invalid.   Because we\n\nconclude here that Local  Rule 3.8(f) is a valid  exercise of the\n\nfederal district court's rule-making authority, it is the federal\n\nversion  of the  Rule  that  will  be  enforced  against  federal\n\nprosecutors  practicing  in  Rhode  Island federal  court.    The\n\nSupremacy  Clause is  relevant  only to  state interference  with\n\nfederal  laws.   See  Hillsborough  County  v. Automated  Medical\r                                                                           \n\nLaboratories, Inc., 471 U.S. 707 (1985).  There is, therefore, no\r                            \n\nconflict  with the  Supremacy  Clause, and  the  decision of  the\n\ndistrict court to the contrary is necessarily reversed.\n\n          Similarly,  the state  defendants' contention  that the\n\ndistrict court  lacked subject matter jurisdiction  to review the\n\nvalidity of  the state version  of Rule 3.8(f)  by virtue of  the\n\n\"Rooker-Feldman\" doctrine is mooted by our decision upholding the\r                         \n\nfederal version of  Rule 3.8(f).

The United States District  Court\n\nfor New Hampshire held  that the federal district court  in Rhode\n\nIsland  has the power to adopt such  a rule with respect to trial\n\nsubpoenas, but does not have  the power to do so with  respect to\n\ngrand jury subpoenas.  For the reasons stated herein, we conclude\n\nthat  the United States District  Court for Rhode  Island has the\n\npower to adopt the  local rule in question, both with  respect to\n\ntrial and grand jury subpoenas.  We therefore affirm in part  and\n\nreverse in part.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\n\n          To fully appreciate the important interests at stake in\n\nthis case, it  is necessary briefly to review some  of the recent\n\nhistory leading to this lawsuit.\n\nI.  Attorney-Subpoenas\r          I.  Attorney-Subpoenas\r                                \n\n          Until recently, federal  prosecutors rarely  subpoenaed\n\nattorneys to  compel testimony relating  to their clients.   This\n\npractice  changed in the 1980s as  the federal government stepped\n\nup its  fight against organized crime  and narcotics trafficking.\n\nMost significantly, Congress passed  several new federal statutes\n\nwhich, in the eyes of federal prosecutors, make attorneys fertile\n\nground for eliciting incriminating information about  the targets\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nof federal investigations and prosecutions.1\n\n          Because service of a subpoena on an attorney implicates\n\nthe attorney-client relationship, and thus  raises ethical issues\n\nfor prosecutors,  the United States Department  of Justice issued\n\nguidelines  for  federal  prosecutors  seeking  to  subpoena   an\n\nattorney.

Before\napproving  a  subpoena to  an  attorney,  the Assistant  Attorney\nGeneral  must  find that  the  information  is  necessary for  an\ninvestigation or prosecution, unavailable from other sources, not\nprotected by privilege, that the  subpoena is narrowly drawn, and\nthat the need for the information outweighs any potential adverse\neffects on the attorney-client relationship.  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\r                                                          \n\n3  In </span><pre class=\"inline\"> the first year that  the Department of  Justice Guidelines\nwere in  effect, July 18, 1985  to July 31, 1986,  the Department\napproved 411 attorney subpoenas, an average of  33 per month.

The Rhode\n\nIsland Supreme  Court later  held a  public hearing  and received\n\nadditional  comments on the proposed rules.  On November 1, 1988,\n\nthe  Rhode Island  Supreme Court  adopted the  proposed Rules  of\n\nProfessional  Conduct as  an  amendment to  Rhode Island  Supreme\n\nCourt Rule 47.   Among the rules adopted  was Rule 3.8(f),  which\n\nprovides:\n\n            Rule 3.8.   Special Responsibilities of a\r                      Rule 3.8.

The state court  invited briefs from  the United States\n\nAttorney  and interested  members of  the  Rhode Island  Bar and,\n\nafter a hearing, denied the petition to amend.  The United States\n\nAttorney then wrote to the United States District Court for Rhode\n\nIsland requesting  that it exempt federal  prosecutors from Local\n\nRule  3.8(f).  When the  district court denied  that request, the\n\nUnited States  Attorney  petitioned  this court  for  a  writ  of\n\nmandamus  requiring   the  district   court  to  exempt   federal\n\nprosecutors from  the local  rule.

Among the\n            perceived  costs,  for  example, are  the\n            potential  loss of  a client's  choice of\n            counsel should the latter be compelled to\n            testify  at the  trial  and the  chilling\n            effect upon  the  client's trust  in  his\n            counsel's loyalty.\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nprescribe rules of practice and procedure for the federal courts.\n\n28 U.S.C.    2072(a).

The Supreme Court  has explained: \"[T]he  whole theory of\n\nthe [grand  jury's] function is that  it belongs to no  branch of\n\nthe institutional  government, serving  as a  kind  of buffer  or\n\nreferee between the Government and the people.\"  United States v.\r                                                                        \n\nWilliams,     U.S.   , 112 S.

As such,\r                                            \n\nthe Rule  regulates the conduct of attorneys appearing before the\n\ncourt  -- a  power well within  the limits of  a federal district\n\ncourt's rule-making authority --  and not the grand jury  per se.\r                                                                          \n\nSecond, we  think the  district court's  reliance on  Williams is\r                                                                        \n\nmisplaced.   Finally, any incidental  effect the Rule  has on the\n\ngrand jury is minimal, and  outweighed by the important interests\n\nserved by the rule.    \n\n          B.  Effect of Local Rule on Grand Jury Functions\r                    B.

The plain language of the Rule\n\ndemonstrates that it  applies to \"[t]he prosecutor in  a criminal\n\ncase.\"   As we pointed out  in Klubock I,  concerning a virtually\r                                                  \n\nidentical ethical rule:\n\n            PF 15 is not  aimed at grand jury action.\r                                                       \n            It   deals   solely  with   prosecutorial\n            conduct in the prosecutor's capacity as a\n            member  of the bar.

In doing so, the Court  announced the following\n\nprinciples, upon which the district court relied in striking down\n\nLocal Rule 3.8(f) as applied to grand jury subpoenas.\n\n               These  authorities  suggest  that  any\n            power federal courts may have to fashion,\n            on  their own initiative,  rules of grand\n            jury procedure is a very limited one, not\n            remotely  comparable  to  the power  they\n            maintain over their own proceedings.

Ct.  at 1744  (citations  omitted)  (emphasis\r                  \n\nadded).  Citing  the history of  the grand jury, both  in England\n\nand  the United  States, the  Williams Court  explained that  the\r                                                \n\ngrand jury sits  in order to asses  whether there is an  adequate\n\nbasis for bringing  a criminal charge,  rather than to  determine\n\nguilt  or innocence.    Therefore, \"requiring  the prosecutor  to\n\npresent  exculpatory evidence  as  well  as inculpatory  evidence\n\nwould  alter the  grand jury's  historical role,  transforming it\r                                                                           \n\nfrom an  accusatory  to an  adjudicatory  body.\"   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  (emphasis\r                                                               \n\nadded).\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n          It can  hardly be  said  that Local  Rule 3.8(f)  would\n\n\"alter  the grand  jury's historic  role\" in  such a  fundamental\n\nfashion.  It certainly does not transform the grand jury  from an\n\naccusatory to an  adjudicatory body.   Indeed, it  has no  effect\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nwhatsoever  on the  grand jury's  accusatory role.   Nor  does it\n\nalter  the traditional  relationships between  prosecutor, court,\n\nand grand jury.  As we have noted, regulation of attorney conduct\n\nis a  traditional role  for  the court  -- one  for  which it  is\n\nparticularly well positioned and suited, and one  which has never\n\nbeen  considered within the purview of the grand jury.  Moreover,\n\nthe  Rule has no effect  on the evidence  ultimately presented by\n\nthe  government.  It merely allows the court to determine, before\n\nan attorney-subpoena is  served, and the damage  to the attorney-\n\nclient  relationship  caused, whether  grounds exist  which would\n\nrender the subpoena  subject to an  order to  quash.  Unlike  the\n\nsituation  in Williams,  Local  Rule 3.8(f)  does not  affect the\r                                \n\ntraditional  equation upon  which the  grand jury  deliberates to\n\nassess whether there is an  adequate basis for bringing  criminal\n\ncharges.\n\n          We  think Williams  is clearly  distinguishable on  the\r                                      \n\nabove grounds alone.  We note in addition, however, that Williams\r                                                                           \n\ninvolved  the use  of a  federal court's  \"supervisory power\"  to\n\ndismiss  an  indictment,  while  this case  involves  a  district\r                 \n\ncourt's  power  merely  to  regulate  the  conduct  of  attorneys\n\nappearing before it.  The supervisory power derives from the need\n\nfor courts  \"to implement  a remedy  for violation of  recognized\n\nrights,  to  preserve  judicial  integrity  by  ensuring  that  a\n\nconviction rests on appropriate considerations validly before the\n\njury,  and .  . . to  deter illegal  conduct.\"   United States v.\r                                                                        \n\nHastings, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">499</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 505  (1982)  (citations omitted).

Thus,  the source\n\nand purpose of the two powers distinguishes them.\n\n          The  nature  and extent  of  the  power exercised  also\n\ndiffer.

This is particularly\n\ntrue  in  criminal  cases.   See  generally  Monroe  H. Freedman,\r                                                     \n\nUnderstanding  Lawyers' Ethics  16 (\"the  lawyer is  the client's\r                                        \n\n'champion  against  a  hostile  world' --  the  client's  zealous\n\nadvocate  against   the  government   itself\").     Clients  rely\n\nextensively   on   their   attorneys'   judgment,   advice,   and\n\nprofessional  competence.      Moreover,  as   legal  rules   and\n\nobligations  become  more complex,  clients  are  forced to  rely\n\nincreasingly on their attorneys, thus elevating the importance of\n\nthe attorney-client relationship.\n\n          The relationship  between attorney and client  is often\n\nan  ongoing  one, built  upon  years of  professional  and social\n\ninteraction.   On  other  occasions it  arises  out of  a  single\n\nincident.   Sometimes  the  client and  attorney  have never  met\n\nbefore.  Although the dynamics of these relationships differ, the\n\nfundamental responsibilities of attorney  to client are the same.\n\nAttorneys  must   diligently  and  competently   represent  their\n\nclients'  interests, keep  their  clients'  confidences, and  not\n\nplace  themselves in  situations where  their interests  conflict\n\nwith   those   of   their    clients.15      To   fulfill   their\n                    \r                              \n\n15   See, e.g., Model Rules of  Professional Conduct Rule 1.1 (\"A\r                        \nlawyer  shall provide competent  representation[, which] requires\nthe  legal  knowledge,  skill,   thoroughness    and  preparation\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\nresponsibilities,  attorneys need information from their clients.\n\nIt  is necessary to the very foundation of our adversarial system\n\nof  justice  that  clients  feel  secure  in  divulging to  their\n\nattorneys  the facts  in their  possession, including  those that\n\nclients think might be incriminating.

This is  not merely  a difference  in semantics.\nLocal  Rule 3.8(f)  is a  prophylactic rule  designed to  address\ncertain perceived  ethical concerns implicated by  the increasing\npractice of federal  prosecutors subpoenaing opposing  counsel to\ncompel  testimony  regarding  a  target client.    These  ethical\nconcerns  simply are not implicated by the issuance of a subpoena\nbecause,  until  the attorney  is served  with the  subpoena, the\nclient  has no  reason to  distrust or  feel uncertain  about his\nattorney's allegiance.

Because we\n\nconclude here that Local  Rule 3.8(f) is a valid  exercise of the\n\nfederal district court's rule-making authority, it is the federal\n\nversion  of the  Rule  that  will  be  enforced  against  federal\n\nprosecutors  practicing  in  Rhode  Island federal  court.    The\n\nSupremacy  Clause is  relevant  only to  state interference  with\n\nfederal  laws.   See  Hillsborough  County  v. Automated  Medical\r                                                                           \n\nLaboratories, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111437\"><a href=\"/opinion/111437/hillsborough-county-v-automated-medical-laboratories-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1985).  There is, therefore, no\r                            \n\nconflict  with the  Supremacy  Clause, and  the  decision of  the\n\ndistrict court to the contrary is necessarily reversed.\n\n          Similarly,  the state  defendants' contention  that the\n\ndistrict court  lacked subject matter jurisdiction  to review the\n\nvalidity of  the state version  of Rule 3.8(f)  by virtue of  the\n\n\"Rooker-Feldman\" doctrine is mooted by our decision upholding the\r                         \n\nfederal version of  Rule 3.8(f).   See Rooker  v. Fidelity  Trust\r                                                                           \n\nCompany, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">;  District of Columbia Court of  Appeals v.\r                                                                        \n\nFeldman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(1983).

The  decision of  the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed in part and reversed in part.\r                                                                 \n\n                               -42-\r\r\n\n                            Appendix A\r                                                \n\nRule  3.8.

It is the belief of the committee\n          that  the  requirements  of   prior  judicial\n          approval, which should  be granted or  denied\n          after  the  opportunity  for  an  adversarial\n          proceeding,  will  serve  as  an  appropriate\n          safeguard to this practice and its  threat to\n          the  confidentiality  and  integrity  of  the\n          attorney-client relationship.   The committee\n          believes  that  a   court  called  upon   for\n          judicial   approval   should  be   guided  by\n          appropriate  standards.    See  e.g.,  United\r                                                                 \n          States  v.
