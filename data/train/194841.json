Plaintiff  appeals from  the summary\n                     \n\ndismissal of his action.  In essence, he wishes to relitigate\n\nin federal court  challenges to a state  court alimony award.\n\nWe affirm the dismissal.\n\n                              I.\n                               \n\n          Plaintiff  filed his  federal court  action against\n\nstate court judges,  a state court marital master, his former\n\nwife,  and the wife's attorney.  Later,  he sought to add his\n\nown  attorney.   There was  no diversity jurisdiction  as all\n\nparties were citizens of  New Hampshire.  Plaintiff, divorced\n\nin  1983, complained of a 1989 alimony award requiring him to\n\npay  his former  wife  $525 every  month.   He stated  he was\n\ntotally  disabled,  his  sole  income  being  from  veteran's\n\ndisability and  social security disability benefits.   He had\n\nmoved  in state court in  1992 to terminate  the 1989 alimony\n\norder  on two grounds:  1) that the Uniformed Services Former\n\nSpouses  Protection   Act,  10  U.S.C.      1408,  prohibited\n\nconsideration of veteran disability compensation in computing\n\nan alimony award and 2) that state law in effect  at the time\n\nof  divorce (1983) prohibited  an award of  alimony after the\n\npassage  of  three  years.   The  state  superior  court  had\n\nrejected both arguments, the  New Hampshire Supreme Court had\n\nsummarily declined his appeal,  and the United States Supreme\n\nCourt had denied certiorari, plaintiff recounted.   Plaintiff\n\nsought  to litigate these same  two challenges to the alimony\n\naward  in federal court, and  he also contended  that the New\n\nHampshire  Supreme  Court  had  denied  him  due  process  by\n\nsummarily  rejecting his  appeal  without first  ordering and\n\nreviewing a transcript.\n\n                             II.\n                               \n\n          Plaintiff's   action    was   properly   dismissed.\n\nPlaintiff may not relitigate  in federal court the challenges\n\nto the alimony award plaintiff presented to  the state court.\n\nMigra v.
