Following  oral argument,\r\n\nfull briefing, and careful plenary  review of the entire  record,\r\n\nwe  affirm the  district  court judgment,  substantially for  the\r\n\nreasons explained in Woods  v. Friction Materials, Inc.,  30 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n255 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          Schwartz commenced  employment with  MITRE in  1983, at\r\n\nage  fifty-two, as a member of its  technical staff.  In the fall\r\n\nof 1990, his job performance rating placed  him in the bottom ten\r\n\npercent of  all technical staff  employees in  his division  with\r\n\ncomparable experience.    A  few months  later,  MITRE  laid  off\r                               \r\n\nSchwartz  and  118  other  employees  in  a reduction  in  force.\r\n\nApproximately  one  year  later,  Schwartz  instituted  this  age\r\n\ndiscrimination action. \r\n\n          The parties  acknowledge that the only  issue on appeal\r\n\nis  whether Schwartz  proffered evidence  sufficient to  enable a\r\n\nreasonable trier of fact  to find that MITRE's stated  reason for\r\n\ndischarging him was a pretext for age discrimination.  See id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n262.     There   can   be  no   question   that  MITRE   gave   a\r\n\nnondiscriminatory reason  for firing  Schwartz, viz.,  failure to\r\n\nperform as well as other division employees  with similar experi-\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1See 29 U.S.C.   623 (1988 &amp; Supp. V); Mass. Gen. Laws Ann.\r                   \r\nch. 151B (West 1996); Charland v. Muzi Motors, Inc., 631 N.E.2d\r                                                             \r\n555, 557-58 (Mass. 1994)(ruling that chapter 151B provides the\r\nexclusive statutory remedy for age discrimination).  \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nence.  Schwartz responded, inappositely, with affidavits general-\r\n\nly attesting to his  abilities as an engineer and  physicist; the\r\n\naffidavits did not,  however, raise  a material issue  as to  the\r\n\ncomparability of  Schwartz'  job performance  vis- -vis  that  of\r\n\nother  division  employees      the articulated  reason  for  the\r\n\ntermination.   Id.  Nor did the statistical evidence submitted by\r                            \r\n\nSchwartz establish  a trialworthy issue in  this disparate treat-\r\n\nment case,  since it did  not purport  to show that  he was  dis-\r\n\ncharged by  MITRE based  on a  discriminatory animus,  as distin-\r\n\nguished  from inferior job performance.  See LeBlanc v. Great Am.\r                                                                           \r\n\nIns. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 848 (1st  Cir. 1993) (noting limited proba-\r                  \r\n\ntive value of statistical  evidence in disparate treatment case),\r\n\ncert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1398 (1994).        Finally,    Schwartz\r                      \r\n\nattested to an occasion in  late 1989, when one George Randig,  a\r\n\nMITRE department  head, allegedly informed a  group of employees,\r\n\nthat MITRE management intended to rate senior employees according\r\n\nto  a new, more  exacting performance standard.   Although Randig\r\n\nwas  not involved  in any way  in the decision  to terminate him,\r\n\nSchwartz  contends  that this  statement  evinces  that age  bias\r\n\ninfected MITRE's entire job  performance evaluation system in the\r\n\nyear  prior to  the reduction  in force  which cost him  his job.\r\n\nBased on a  careful review  of the  affidavit in  the light  most\r\n\nfavorable to Schwartz, id. at 841, we conclude that it too failed\r                                    \r\n\nto raise a genuine issue of material fact on the question of pre-\r\n\ntext.          First, as the district court held,  the inferences\r\n\nSchwartz would have  the court draw are highly  speculative; just\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nhow  speculative cannot  readily be  determined due  to Schwartz'\r\n\nfailure to proffer the Randig language upon which he would have a\r\n\nfactfinder  draw the inferences for  which he contends.   And, in\r\n\nall  events, MITRE considered  Schwartz' job performance inferior\r\n\nto  other  division  employees  of similar  experience  and  age.\r                                                                          \r\n\nConsequently,  even  assuming the  affidavit  were sufficient  to\r\n\nsupport a  reasonable inference that MITRE  rated older employees\r\n\nmore severely  than younger employees     to facilitate inclusion\r\n\nof older employees  in any  reduction in force     the  affidavit\r\n\nnevertheless is inapposite to the articulated basis for Schwartz'\r\n\ntermination.  In sum,  there is no competent evidence  of pretext\r\n\nwhich would support the present age discrimination claim.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                            \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n",
