(\"the Bank\"),\n\nwas involuntarily retired from his position as Executive Vice\n\nPresident  for  Corporate  Affairs   on  November  1,   1992,\n\napproximately one  month after his sixty-fifth  birthday, and\n\napproximately  one week  after  he  filed age  discrimination\n\nclaims against the Bank and  its holding company, the  Boston\n\nFive  Bancorp,  with  the  Massachusetts  Commission  Against\n\nDiscrimination   and   the   Equal   Employment   Opportunity\n\nCommission.    It   is  undisputed   that  the   Bank  forced\n\nMorrissey  to retire because of his age.  The question before\n\nus is whether  the Bank's  action was lawful  under a  narrow\n\nexemption  to the  Age Discrimination  in Employment  Act, 29\n\nU.S.C.       621-34   (\"ADEA\"),   which  permits   compulsory\n\nretirement, at age sixty-five and older, of certain employees\n\nwho  occupy  \"bona  fide  executive\"  or  \"high policymaking\"\n\npositions  for  the  two-year  period  immediately  preceding\n\nretirement, if such employees are entitled upon retirement to\n\nan immediate  nonforfeitable annual retirement benefit  of at\n\nleast  $44,000.  See 29  U.S.C.   631(c)(1).   We answer this\r                                \n\nquestion  in  the  affirmative,  and   therefore  affirm  the\n\ndistrict court's order granting  summary judgment in favor of\n\nthe Bank.  \n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n                        I.

PB Diagnostic Systems, Inc., No. 94-1680, slip op. at\r                                               \n\n10-11 (1st Cir. March 30, 1995). \n\n          The  Bank hired  Morrissey as  a Vice  President in\n\nJune  of  1972, and  later promoted  him  to the  position of\n\nSenior  Vice President.   In  1978 or  1979, the  Bank's then\n\nChief  Executive  Officer (\"CEO\"),  Robert  Spiller, promoted\n\nMorrissey  to Executive Vice President for Corporate Affairs.\n\nMorrissey  continued to  hold  this position  until the  Bank\n\nforced him  to retire, at which time he was the fifth highest\n\npaid employee at the Bank.  \n\n          In  his  capacity as  Executive Vice  President for\n\nCorporate Affairs, Morrissey reported directly to the CEO and\n\nwas  responsible   for  (i)  monitoring   state  and  federal\n\nregulations  and  advising  the  Bank  with  respect  to  the\n\ninfluence and  effect of these regulations  upon the business\n\nof the Bank, and  recommending action where appropriate; (ii)\n\ndeveloping   and   recommending   merger    and   acquisition\n\ncandidates; and (iii) developing sources of  loan and deposit\n\nbusiness  for  the  Bank.    In  addition  to  these  duties,\n\nMorrissey  served as  a  member of  the  Asset and  Liability\n\nCommittee, and  regularly attended the meetings  of the Board\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nof  Directors.  He also  attended the weekly  meetings of the\n\nBank's six most senior officers (\"Senior Officers Group\"). \n\n           In  1990,  Robert  Spiller retired  and  defendant\n\nPeter  Blampied  succeeded him  as CEO.    The Bank  does not\n\ncontest  Morrissey's  assertion  that this  event  took place\n\nshortly  before  the  statutory two-year  period  immediately\n\nprior to his involuntary retirement.  By Morrissey's account,\n\nhis  role  in  the  formulation of  Bank  policy  was greatly\n\ndiminished  after  Blampied  took  over as  CEO.    Morrissey\n\ncontends, for example, that whereas under former CEO Spiller,\n\nthe  weekly meeting of the Senior Officers Group served as an\n\nopportunity for the officers to discuss and to participate in\n\npolicymaking  decisions, under  CEO  Blampied,  this  meeting\n\nceased to serve the same policymaking function.  Instead, all\n\nhigh policy decisions were made by the Board of Directors, or\n\nby  a  subset   of  senior  officers  that  did  not  include\n\nMorrissey, which  specifically excluded him  from high policy\n\ndiscussions of important issues such as the Bank's distressed\n\nreal estate  holdings, its dealings with  regulators, and its\n\nthree-year strategic  business plan.  Morrissey  also asserts\n\nthat   Blampied   did   not   specifically   solicit   policy\n\nrecommendations  from  him,  and  that,  at  his  deposition,\n\nBlampied could  recall  specific comments  by Morrissey  with\n\nrespect to only one policy matter.       \n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          On July 28, 1992, Blampied  advised Morrissey that,\n\nin view  of  the  fact  that  his  sixty-fifth  birthday  was\n\napproaching, he should be thinking about retiring.  Morrissey\n\nreplied  that he  had no  intention of  retiring and  that he\n\ncould not afford  to retire because he had to provide for his\n\nyoung family.   Morrissey turned sixty-five  on September 29,\n\n1992.   On  October 6,  1992, Blampied  again told  Morrissey\n\nthat,  because he was  sixty-five, he  should be  thinking of\n\nretiring.  Blampied also suggested the possibility of a year-\n\nto-year  paid consulting  arrangement.   The  following  day,\n\nMorrissey  received a memorandum  outlining this arrangement,\n\nto  which  he responded  later in  the  day.   Morrissey told\n\nBlampied that  he had not agreed to  the proposed arrangement\n\nand asked  whether Blampied had consulted  with any attorneys\n\non the matter.   Blampied replied that he had  \"checked every\n\nbase,\" that he  was going  to \"play hardball,\"  and that  the\n\nproposed consulting arrangement was rescinded.  At some point\n\nduring this  meeting, Morrissey asked for  the opportunity to\n\nreview the matter with attorneys and other consultants. \n\n          On October  13,  1992, Morrissey  received  written\n\nnotification that his retirement  would be effective November\n\n1, 1992.   At the  time of this  notification, Morrissey  was\n\nentitled  to  receive  $38,352  annually   in  nonforfeitable\n\npension benefits  under his Qualified  Benefit Plan  (\"QBP\"),\n\nplus $17,592 annually in pension benefits under his Executive\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nSupplemental Benefits Plan (\"SERP\").   The SERP benefits were\n\nforfeitable   upon  certain   conditions  specified   in  the\n\ncontract.   On  October 26, 1992,  Morrissey filed  state and\n\nfederal  age discrimination  claims  with  the  Massachusetts\n\nCommission  Against Discrimination  and the  Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission.   By his account,  Morrissey gave the\n\nBank written notice of  these claims on his October  28, 1992\n\napplication for pension benefits.  \n\n          On October 29, 1992, the Executive Committee of the\n\nBoard  of  Directors held  a  special  meeting via  telephone\n\nconference,   during  which  the  Committee  voted  to  waive\n\nirrevocably the forfeitability conditions of Morrissey's SERP\n\nas to  $6,000 of the annual  pension benefit to  which he was\n\nentitled under that plan, as of November 1, 1992.  The effect\n\nof the Committee's vote  was to increase the total  amount of\n\nMorrissey's  nonforfeitable annual  pension benefit  from the\n\n$38,352 to which he  was entitled under his QBP,  to slightly\n\nmore  than  the  $44,000  minimum  required  under  the  ADEA\n\nexemption.  Morrissey  was informed  of the  increase in  the\n\namount of  his nonforfeitable pension benefit  on October 30,\n\n1992.  On November 1, 1992, he was forced to retire.  \n\n          On  August  20,  1993  (after having  been  granted\n\npermission to withdraw his administrative  claims), Morrissey\n\nfiled suit  in the  Massachusetts Superior Court  against the\n\nBank, the Boston  Five Bancorp, the individual members of the\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nExecutive  Committee,  and the  administrators of  the Bank's\n\npension  benefits   plan.1     The   complaint  alleged   age\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation in  violation of the ADEA, the\n\nMassachusetts Unlawful Discrimination Act, Gen. L. ch. 151B  \n\n4,  and the Massachusetts Equal Rights Under Law Act, Gen. L.\n\nch. 93     102 and 103.2   The Bank removed  the case to  the\n\nUnited   States   District   Court  for   the   District   of\n\nMassachusetts pursuant to 28  U.S.C.   1441, and subsequently\n\nfiled  a motion for summary judgment on all claims, which the\n\ndistrict court granted. \n\n                   II.

First, he\n\nargues  that during the last two years of his employment with\n\nthe Bank, he was not, in fact, a  high policymaker within the\n\nmeaning of  the ADEA exemption,  and that the  district court\n\nerred  by failing to apply a functional test to determine his\n\nstatus.  Second, he contends that the district court erred in\n\ninterpreting the pension benefit prong of the exemption so as\n\nto permit an employer to increase the amount of an employee's\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nnonforfeitable  pension  benefit  after  the alleged  act  of\n\ndiscrimination in order to meet the statutory minimum amount.\n\nFinally, Morrissey argues that  the district court's grant of\n\nsummary   judgment  was  improper  because  the  supplemental\n\naffidavits he submitted  in support  of his Fed.  R. Civ.  P.\n\n56(f) (\"Rule  56(f)\") motion demonstrated a  genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact.   Alternatively,  he argues  that, in view  of\n\nthese affidavits, the  district court  should have  exercised\n\nits discretion  under Rule 56(f)  to defer judgment  until he\n\nhad  an opportunity to depose the affiants.

The ADEA provides\n\nthe following narrow exemption from this prohibition:\n\n          Nothing   in   this   chapter  shall   be\n          construed    to    prohibit    compulsory\n          retirement  of  any   employee  who   has\n          attained 65 years of age and who, for the\n          2-year    period    immediately    before\n          retirement,  is employed  in a  bona fide\n          executive   or    a   high   policymaking\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.

We  find guidance, however,\n\nin the EEOC interpretive regulations set forth in 29 C.F.R.  \n\n1625.12 (1994).     \n\n          Section  1625.12(e)  defines  high policymakers  as\n\n\"`certain  top  level  employees   who  are  not  \"bona  fide\n\nexecutives,\"'\"  and as  \"`individuals who  have little  or no\n\nline authority but whose position and responsibility are such\n\nthat  they  play a  significant  role in  the  development of\n\ncorporate policy and effectively recommend the implementation\n\nthereof.'\"   29 C.F.R.   1625.12(e)  (quoting H.R. Conf. Rep.\n\nNo. 950,  95th Cong., 2d Sess. 10  (1978)).  For example, the\n\nchief economist or chief  research scientist of a corporation\n\nwould likely be a high policymaker:\n\n          His    duties    would    be    primarily\n          intellectual as opposed  to executive  or\n          managerial.  His responsibility  would be\n          to   evaluate  significant   economic  or\n          scientific trends and issues,  to develop\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          and recommend policy direction to the top\n          executive  officers  of the  corporation,\n          and he would have a significant impact on\n          the ultimate decision on such policies by\n          virtue of his expertise and direct access\n          to the decisionmakers.  Such  an employee\n          would  meet the  definition  of  a  `high\n          policymaking' employee.\n\nId.\r               \n\n          As to the  scope of the exemption,    1625.12(b) of\n\nthe  regulations  admonishes  that  it  should  be  construed\n\nnarrowly,  and  that \"the  burden is  on  the one  seeking to\n\ninvoke  the exemption  to show  that every  element has  been\n\nclearly and unmistakably met.\"\n\n          Morrissey does not dispute that,  as Executive Vice\n\nPresident  for Corporate Affairs, he held the title of a high\n\npolicymaker.    Indeed, he  concedes  that  under former  CEO\n\nSpiller,  he was a high policymaker.  Instead, he argues that\n\nthe district court failed to apply the proper standard in its\n\nanalysis  and overlooked  genuine  issues  of material  fact.\n\nMorrissey's argument  rests upon two premises,  one legal and\n\none factual.  The legal premise is that the law requires that\n\nhis  status as a high  policymaker be determined,  not on the\n\nbasis of what  he calls the  \"appearances\" or \"trappings\"  of\n\nhis position -- i.e., title, salary, access to decisionmakers\n\n-- but on the basis of his effectiveness as a policymaker, as\n\njudged   by   his   actual   impact  on   Bank   policy   and\n\ndecisionmaking.  The factual premise is that, although he may\n\nhave been  a high policymaker  under former CEO  Spiller, and\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nwhile  he continued  to hold  the same  title until  the Bank\n\nforced him  to retire, he no longer functioned as a true high\n\npolicymaker  during  the   two-year  statutory  period,  with\n\nBlampied as CEO.  \n\n          We find  that, even assuming arguendo  the truth of\r                                                           \n\nMorrissey's legal premise and applying the effectiveness test\n\nhe urges,  the undisputed  facts clearly demonstrate  that he\n\nwas  a  high policymaker  during  the  relevant time  period.\n\nSignificantly, Morrissey does not dispute the following:  (i)\n\nHe  reported directly to the CEO and had direct access to the\n\nBank's decisionmakers.  (ii)  He attended the weekly meetings\n\nof the Senior Officers Group.  (iii) He alone was responsible\n\nfor monitoring  state and federal legislative  and regulatory\n\ndevelopments, and  in that  capacity recommended  policies to\n\nensure  that the Bank remained in compliance with them.  (iv)\n\nHe worked closely with  state legislators on legislation that\n\nwas  important to the savings  bank industry, and  that had a\n\nsubstantial impact on the  welfare of the  Bank.  (v) He  was\n\nresponsible  for  monitoring and  coordinating  important tax\n\nlitigation  involving  the  Bank,  and  made  recommendations\n\nregarding the choice of legal counsel to handle it.  (vi) The\n\nBank  acted  upon Morrissey's  strong recommendation  that it\n\nlower  the interest  rate on  its passbook  savings accounts.\n\n(vii) He recommended that the Bank acquire the First American\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nBank.   (viii) He was responsible  for the sale of the Bank's\n\ndeposits in a branch office.\n\n          Even assuming  that a high  policymaker within  the\n\nmeaning  of the ADEA must  function at some  minimum level of\n\neffectiveness, Morrissey  was more  than effective enough  to\n\nmake precise line-drawing unnecessary  here.  As the district\n\ncourt stated:\n\n          Morrissey  had direct  access to  the top\n          decisionmakers,  he  was responsible  for\n          evaluating  significant  legislative  and\n          regulatory trends and issues  and working\n          with  legislators on these issues, and he\n          recommended  policy  on acquisitions  and\n          mergers, capitalization,  and other areas\n          of   importance  to   the   Bank.      If\n          Morrissey's  position, the  fifth highest\n          in  the Bank,  were not  to qualify  as a\n          high policymaking position,  it would  be\n          difficult to find a position that did.\n\nMorrissey  v.  Boston Five  Cents Sav.  Bank, F.S.B.,  866 F.\r                                                                \n\nSupp. 643, 647 (D. Mass. 1994).\n\n          Given  our  conclusion,  based  on  the  undisputed\n\nfacts,  that  Morrissey was  a  high  policymaker during  the\n\nstatutory two-year period, we need  not dwell on his argument\n\nthat  the  district court  failed  to  apply the  \"functional\n\nanalysis\" set forth in Whittlesey v. Union Carbide Corp., 567\r                                                                    \n\nF.

Morrissey argues  that the requirement\n\nhas  not  been  met  because  the  law  forbids  \"last-minute\n\nmanipulations  of the  pension benefit  to bring  an employee\n\nwithin the exemption.\"  The district court's analysis  of the\n\nintended function of the pension benefit provision compels us\n\nto agree with the Bank. \n\n          The   district   court   considered  two   possible\n\ninterpretations  of the  pension  benefit prong.   Under  one\n\ninterpretation, the  exemption would  apply to  employees who\n\nqualify as  high policymakers \"provided that  these employees\r                                                        \n\nreceive  an adequate  pension.\"  Morrissey,  866 F.

This view holds that  the pension benefit prong is not\n\n\"part of the test to determine if an employee can be retired,\r                                             \n\nbut rather [i]s  simply a requirement imposed on the employer\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nto  pay  out  $44,000 annually  in  benefits  for every  high\n\npolicymaker  compelled to  retire.\"   Id.   Under  the second\r                                                     \n\ninterpretation,  both the  job  function and  pension benefit\r                                 \n\nprongs  of  the  exemption  comprise the  test  to  determine\n\nwhether compulsory retirement is permitted.  Id. \r                                                            \n\n          We think the first  interpretation is more faithful\n\nto the statute.  After all, Congress did not impose the  same\n\ntwo-year minimum on  both prongs  of the exemption.   By  the\n\ndistrict  court's   analysis,  the  exemption   contains  two\n\ndistinct temporal  restrictions, one of which  applies to the\n\nhigh policymaker prong, and the other of which applies to the\n\npension benefit prong:\n\n          On  the  one  hand,   Congress  prevented\n          manipulation  of   the  high  policymaker\n          prong of the exemption by  requiring that\n          high  policymakers  serve  for two  years\r                                                               \n          before   the  exemption   applies;  thus,\n          promotions  followed by  quick retirement\n          are not permissible.  On the  other hand,\n          more modest time  restrictions attach  to\n          the pension funds prong:  Congress merely\n          required  that an employee be entitled to\n          an immediate benefit of  $44,000 annually\r                                  \n          upon retirement.\n\nId.\r               \n\n          Had Congress meant for both prongs to be subject to\n\nthe two-year  minimum, it  presumably would have  limited the\n\nexemption  to  the  employee   who  \"for  the  2-year  period\n\nimmediately  before retirement, is employed  in a .  . . high\n\npolicymaking  position,  [and]  .  .  .  is  entitled  to  an\r                                         \n\nimmediate nonforfeitable annual retirement benefit  . . . . \"\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nThat, however, is not  what Congress wrote.  Under  the ADEA,\n\nthe  high policymaker who is compelled to retire need only be\n\nentitled to  the statutory minimum  amount in  nonforfeitable\n\nannual pension benefits immediately upon retirement.\n\n          In sum, we find the district court's analysis to be\n\npersuasive and consistent with what the plain language of the\n\nexemption would seem to require.4    \n\n                  C.  The Rule 56(f) Motion\r                              C.  The Rule 56(f) Motion\r                                                       \n\n          In opposition  to  the Bank's  motion  for  summary\n\njudgment, Morrissey submitted a Rule 56(f) affidavit,  urging\n\nthat summary judgment  be denied or,  alternatively, deferred\n\non the ground that he had not had an opportunity to engage in\n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  Our reading of the exemption forecloses Morrissey's other\nargument, that both prongs of the exemption must be satisfied\nat least as of the date  the employee receives notice of  his\ninvoluntary retirement.  Morrissey  characterizes the date of\nnotice   of  retirement   as   the  time   of   the  act   of\ndiscrimination.  As we  construe the statute, as long  as the\nemployee  is entitled to the  statutory minimum benefit as of\nthe day of  his involuntary  retirement, and as  long as  the\nemployee  is  otherwise  within  the exemption,  the  act  of\ncompelling the high policymaking  employee to retire does not\nconstitute an act of discrimination.\n    It   also  forecloses   his  argument  that   the  Bank's\nmodification   of   his   benefits   should  be   viewed   as\n\"manipulation.\"  In support of this argument, Morrissey urges\nthe  case of  Passer v.  American Chem.  Soc'y, 935  F.2d 322\r                                                          \n(D.C. Cir. 1991).

The \"manipulation\" in that case was a\nmatter  of interpretive  and accounting  legerdemain.   Here,\nthere is no question that Morrissey was genuinely entitled to\nat least this amount by the terms of his plan as amended.\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\n\"meaningful discovery.\"5   At the  summary judgment  hearing,\n\nthe court responded  to the Rule 56(f) affidavit  by ordering\n\nthe Bank to produce documents,  including minutes of Board of\n\nDirectors meetings  that Morrissey had requested.   The court\n\nalso ordered  Morrissey to  file a  more specific  Rule 56(f)\n\naffidavit.   Morrissey  responded  by  filing a  supplemental\n\nmemorandum  and affidavits  by  four  individuals,6 which  he\n\ncontends clearly demonstrated that he was removed from a high\n\npolicymaking   position  when  Blampied   became  CEO.    The\n\nmemorandum   also  requested   permission  to   depose  these\n\nindividuals.   On appeal,  Morrissey  contends that,  because\n\nthese  affidavits  demonstrated  the existence  of  a genuine\n\ndispute  of material  fact,  the district  court should  have\n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.

(\"the Bank\"),\n\nwas involuntarily retired from his position as Executive Vice\n\nPresident  for  Corporate  Affairs   on  November  1,   1992,\n\napproximately one  month after his sixty-fifth  birthday, and\n\napproximately  one week  after  he  filed age  discrimination\n\nclaims against the Bank and  its holding company, the  Boston\n\nFive  Bancorp,  with  the  Massachusetts  Commission  Against\n\nDiscrimination   and   the   Equal   Employment   Opportunity\n\nCommission.    It   is  undisputed   that  the   Bank  forced\n\nMorrissey  to retire because of his age.  The question before\n\nus is whether  the Bank's  action was lawful  under a  narrow\n\nexemption  to the  Age Discrimination  in Employment  Act, 29\n\nU.S.C.       621-34   (\"ADEA\"),   which  permits   compulsory\n\nretirement, at age sixty-five and older, of certain employees\n\nwho  occupy  \"bona  fide  executive\"  or  \"high policymaking\"\n\npositions  for  the  two-year  period  immediately  preceding\n\nretirement, if such employees are entitled upon retirement to\n\nan immediate  nonforfeitable annual retirement benefit  of at\n\nleast  $44,000.  See 29  U.S.C.   631(c)(1).   We answer this\r                                \n\nquestion  in  the  affirmative,  and   therefore  affirm  the\n\ndistrict court's order granting  summary judgment in favor of\n\nthe Bank.  \n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n                        I.

PB Diagnostic Systems, Inc., No. 94-1680, slip op. at\r                                               \n\n10-11 (1st Cir. March 30, 1995). \n\n          The  Bank hired  Morrissey as  a Vice  President in\n\nJune  of  1972, and  later promoted  him  to the  position of\n\nSenior  Vice President.   In  1978 or  1979, the  Bank's then\n\nChief  Executive  Officer (\"CEO\"),  Robert  Spiller, promoted\n\nMorrissey  to Executive Vice President for Corporate Affairs.\n\nMorrissey  continued to  hold  this position  until the  Bank\n\nforced him  to retire, at which time he was the fifth highest\n\npaid employee at the Bank.  \n\n          In  his  capacity as  Executive Vice  President for\n\nCorporate Affairs, Morrissey reported directly to the CEO and\n\nwas  responsible   for  (i)  monitoring   state  and  federal\n\nregulations  and  advising  the  Bank  with  respect  to  the\n\ninfluence and  effect of these regulations  upon the business\n\nof the Bank, and  recommending action where appropriate; (ii)\n\ndeveloping   and   recommending   merger    and   acquisition\n\ncandidates; and (iii) developing sources of  loan and deposit\n\nbusiness  for  the  Bank.    In  addition  to  these  duties,\n\nMorrissey  served as  a  member of  the  Asset and  Liability\n\nCommittee, and  regularly attended the meetings  of the Board\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nof  Directors.  He also  attended the weekly  meetings of the\n\nBank's six most senior officers (\"Senior Officers Group\"). \n\n           In  1990,  Robert  Spiller retired  and  defendant\n\nPeter  Blampied  succeeded him  as CEO.    The Bank  does not\n\ncontest  Morrissey's  assertion  that this  event  took place\n\nshortly  before  the  statutory two-year  period  immediately\n\nprior to his involuntary retirement.  By Morrissey's account,\n\nhis  role  in  the  formulation of  Bank  policy  was greatly\n\ndiminished  after  Blampied  took  over as  CEO.    Morrissey\n\ncontends, for example, that whereas under former CEO Spiller,\n\nthe  weekly meeting of the Senior Officers Group served as an\n\nopportunity for the officers to discuss and to participate in\n\npolicymaking  decisions, under  CEO  Blampied,  this  meeting\n\nceased to serve the same policymaking function.  Instead, all\n\nhigh policy decisions were made by the Board of Directors, or\n\nby  a  subset   of  senior  officers  that  did  not  include\n\nMorrissey, which  specifically excluded him  from high policy\n\ndiscussions of important issues such as the Bank's distressed\n\nreal estate  holdings, its dealings with  regulators, and its\n\nthree-year strategic  business plan.  Morrissey  also asserts\n\nthat   Blampied   did   not   specifically   solicit   policy\n\nrecommendations  from  him,  and  that,  at  his  deposition,\n\nBlampied could  recall  specific comments  by Morrissey  with\n\nrespect to only one policy matter.       \n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          On July 28, 1992, Blampied  advised Morrissey that,\n\nin view  of  the  fact  that  his  sixty-fifth  birthday  was\n\napproaching, he should be thinking about retiring.  Morrissey\n\nreplied  that he  had no  intention of  retiring and  that he\n\ncould not afford  to retire because he had to provide for his\n\nyoung family.   Morrissey turned sixty-five  on September 29,\n\n1992.   On  October 6,  1992, Blampied  again told  Morrissey\n\nthat,  because he was  sixty-five, he  should be  thinking of\n\nretiring.  Blampied also suggested the possibility of a year-\n\nto-year  paid consulting  arrangement.   The  following  day,\n\nMorrissey  received a memorandum  outlining this arrangement,\n\nto  which  he responded  later in  the  day.   Morrissey told\n\nBlampied that  he had not agreed to  the proposed arrangement\n\nand asked  whether Blampied had consulted  with any attorneys\n\non the matter.   Blampied replied that he had  \"checked every\n\nbase,\" that he  was going  to \"play hardball,\"  and that  the\n\nproposed consulting arrangement was rescinded.  At some point\n\nduring this  meeting, Morrissey asked for  the opportunity to\n\nreview the matter with attorneys and other consultants. \n\n          On October  13,  1992, Morrissey  received  written\n\nnotification that his retirement  would be effective November\n\n1, 1992.   At the  time of this  notification, Morrissey  was\n\nentitled  to  receive  $38,352  annually   in  nonforfeitable\n\npension benefits  under his Qualified  Benefit Plan  (\"QBP\"),\n\nplus $17,592 annually in pension benefits under his Executive\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nSupplemental Benefits Plan (\"SERP\").   The SERP benefits were\n\nforfeitable   upon  certain   conditions  specified   in  the\n\ncontract.   On  October 26, 1992,  Morrissey filed  state and\n\nfederal  age discrimination  claims  with  the  Massachusetts\n\nCommission  Against Discrimination  and the  Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission.   By his account,  Morrissey gave the\n\nBank written notice of  these claims on his October  28, 1992\n\napplication for pension benefits.  \n\n          On October 29, 1992, the Executive Committee of the\n\nBoard  of  Directors held  a  special  meeting via  telephone\n\nconference,   during  which  the  Committee  voted  to  waive\n\nirrevocably the forfeitability conditions of Morrissey's SERP\n\nas to  $6,000 of the annual  pension benefit to  which he was\n\nentitled under that plan, as of November 1, 1992.  The effect\n\nof the Committee's vote  was to increase the total  amount of\n\nMorrissey's  nonforfeitable annual  pension benefit  from the\n\n$38,352 to which he  was entitled under his QBP,  to slightly\n\nmore  than  the  $44,000  minimum  required  under  the  ADEA\n\nexemption.  Morrissey  was informed  of the  increase in  the\n\namount of  his nonforfeitable pension benefit  on October 30,\n\n1992.  On November 1, 1992, he was forced to retire.  \n\n          On  August  20,  1993  (after having  been  granted\n\npermission to withdraw his administrative  claims), Morrissey\n\nfiled suit  in the  Massachusetts Superior Court  against the\n\nBank, the Boston  Five Bancorp, the individual members of the\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nExecutive  Committee,  and the  administrators of  the Bank's\n\npension  benefits   plan.1     The   complaint  alleged   age\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation in  violation of the ADEA, the\n\nMassachusetts Unlawful Discrimination Act, Gen.

First, he\n\nargues  that during the last two years of his employment with\n\nthe Bank, he was not, in fact, a  high policymaker within the\n\nmeaning of  the ADEA exemption,  and that the  district court\n\nerred  by failing to apply a functional test to determine his\n\nstatus.  Second, he contends that the district court erred in\n\ninterpreting the pension benefit prong of the exemption so as\n\nto permit an employer to increase the amount of an employee's\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nnonforfeitable  pension  benefit  after  the alleged  act  of\n\ndiscrimination in order to meet the statutory minimum amount.\n\nFinally, Morrissey argues that  the district court's grant of\n\nsummary   judgment  was  improper  because  the  supplemental\n\naffidavits he submitted  in support  of his Fed.  R. Civ.  P.\n\n56(f) (\"Rule  56(f)\") motion demonstrated a  genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact.   Alternatively,  he argues  that, in view  of\n\nthese affidavits, the  district court  should have  exercised\n\nits discretion  under Rule 56(f)  to defer judgment  until he\n\nhad  an opportunity to depose the affiants.

We  find guidance, however,\n\nin the EEOC interpretive regulations set forth in 29 C.F.R.  \n\n1625.12 (1994).     \n\n          Section  1625.12(e)  defines  high policymakers  as\n\n\"`certain  top  level  employees   who  are  not  \"bona  fide\n\nexecutives,\"'\"  and as  \"`individuals who  have little  or no\n\nline authority but whose position and responsibility are such\n\nthat  they  play a  significant  role in  the  development of\n\ncorporate policy and effectively recommend the implementation\n\nthereof.'\"   29 C.F.R.   1625.12(e)  (quoting H.R. Conf. Rep.\n\nNo. 950,  95th Cong., 2d Sess. 10  (1978)).  For example, the\n\nchief economist or chief  research scientist of a corporation\n\nwould likely be a high policymaker:\n\n          His    duties    would    be    primarily\n          intellectual as opposed  to executive  or\n          managerial.  His responsibility  would be\n          to   evaluate  significant   economic  or\n          scientific trends and issues,  to develop\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          and recommend policy direction to the top\n          executive  officers  of the  corporation,\n          and he would have a significant impact on\n          the ultimate decision on such policies by\n          virtue of his expertise and direct access\n          to the decisionmakers.  Such  an employee\n          would  meet the  definition  of  a  `high\n          policymaking' employee.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\r               \n\n          As to </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">the  scope of the exemption,    1625.12(b) of\n\nthe  regulations  admonishes  that  it  should  be  construed\n\nnarrowly,  and  that \"the  burden is  on  the one  seeking to\n\ninvoke  the exemption  to show  that every  element has  been\n\nclearly and unmistakably met.\"\n\n          Morrissey does not dispute that,  as Executive Vice\n\nPresident  for Corporate Affairs, he held the title of a high\n\npolicymaker.    Indeed, he  concedes  that  under former  CEO\n\nSpiller,  he was a high policymaker.  Instead, he argues that\n\nthe district court failed to apply the proper standard in its\n\nanalysis  and overlooked  genuine  issues  of material  fact.\n\nMorrissey's argument  rests upon two premises,  one legal and\n\none factual.  The legal premise is that the law requires that\n\nhis  status as a high  policymaker be determined,  not on the\n\nbasis of what  he calls the  \"appearances\" or \"trappings\"  of\n\nhis position -- i.e., title, salary, access to decisionmakers\n\n-- but on the basis of his effectiveness as a policymaker, as\n\njudged   by   his   actual   impact  on   Bank   policy   and\n\ndecisionmaking.  The factual premise is that, although he may\n\nhave been  a high policymaker  under former CEO  Spiller, and\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nwhile  he continued  to hold  the same  title until  the Bank\n\nforced him  to retire, he no longer functioned as a true high\n\npolicymaker  during  the   two-year  statutory  period,  with\n\nBlampied as CEO.  \n\n          We find  that, even assuming arguendo  the truth of\r                                                           \n\nMorrissey's legal premise and applying the effectiveness test\n\nhe urges,  the undisputed  facts clearly demonstrate  that he\n\nwas  a  high policymaker  during  the  relevant time  period.\n\nSignificantly, Morrissey does not dispute the following:  (i)\n\nHe  reported directly to the CEO and had direct access to the\n\nBank's decisionmakers.  (ii)  He attended the weekly meetings\n\nof the Senior Officers Group.  (iii) He alone was responsible\n\nfor monitoring  state and federal legislative  and regulatory\n\ndevelopments, and  in that  capacity recommended  policies to\n\nensure  that the Bank remained in compliance with them.  (iv)\n\nHe worked closely with  state legislators on legislation that\n\nwas  important to the savings  bank industry, and  that had a\n\nsubstantial impact on the  welfare of the  Bank.  (v) He  was\n\nresponsible  for  monitoring and  coordinating  important tax\n\nlitigation  involving  the  Bank,  and  made  recommendations\n\nregarding the choice of legal counsel to handle it.  (vi) The\n\nBank  acted  upon Morrissey's  strong recommendation  that it\n\nlower  the interest  rate on  its passbook  savings accounts.\n\n(vii) He recommended that the Bank acquire the First American\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nBank.   (viii) He was responsible  for the sale of the Bank's\n\ndeposits in a branch office.\n\n          Even assuming  that a high  policymaker within  the\n\nmeaning  of the ADEA must  function at some  minimum level of\n\neffectiveness, Morrissey  was more  than effective enough  to\n\nmake precise line-drawing unnecessary  here.  As the district\n\ncourt stated:\n\n          Morrissey  had direct  access to  the top\n          decisionmakers,  he  was responsible  for\n          evaluating  significant  legislative  and\n          regulatory trends and issues  and working\n          with  legislators on these issues, and he\n          recommended  policy  on acquisitions  and\n          mergers, capitalization,  and other areas\n          of   importance  to   the   Bank.      If\n          Morrissey's  position, the  fifth highest\n          in  the Bank,  were not  to qualify  as a\n          high policymaking position,  it would  be\n          difficult to find a position that did.\n\nMorrissey  v.

By  the\n\ndistrict  court's   analysis,  the  exemption   contains  two\n\ndistinct temporal  restrictions, one of which  applies to the\n\nhigh policymaker prong, and the other of which applies to the\n\npension benefit prong:\n\n          On  the  one  hand,   Congress  prevented\n          manipulation  of   the  high  policymaker\n          prong of the exemption by  requiring that\n          high  policymakers  serve  for two  years\r                                                               \n          before   the  exemption   applies;  thus,\n          promotions  followed by  quick retirement\n          are not permissible.  On the  other hand,\n          more modest time  restrictions attach  to\n          the pension funds prong:  Congress merely\n          required  that an employee be entitled to\n          an immediate benefit of  $44,000 annually\r                                  \n          upon retirement.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\r               \n\n          Had Congress </span><pre class=\"inline\">meant for both prongs to be subject to\n\nthe two-year  minimum, it  presumably would have  limited the\n\nexemption  to  the  employee   who  \"for  the  2-year  period\n\nimmediately  before retirement, is employed  in a .  . . high\n\npolicymaking  position,  [and]  .  .  .  is  entitled  to  an\r                                         \n\nimmediate nonforfeitable annual retirement benefit  . . . . \"\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nThat, however, is not  what Congress wrote.  Under  the ADEA,\n\nthe  high policymaker who is compelled to retire need only be\n\nentitled to  the statutory minimum  amount in  nonforfeitable\n\nannual pension benefits immediately upon retirement.\n\n          In sum, we find the district court's analysis to be\n\npersuasive and consistent with what the plain language of the\n\nexemption would seem to require.4    \n\n                  C.

Our reading of the exemption forecloses Morrissey's other\nargument, that both prongs of the exemption must be satisfied\nat least as of the date  the employee receives notice of  his\ninvoluntary retirement.  Morrissey  characterizes the date of\nnotice   of  retirement   as   the  time   of   the  act   of\ndiscrimination.  As we  construe the statute, as long  as the\nemployee  is entitled to the  statutory minimum benefit as of\nthe day of  his involuntary  retirement, and as  long as  the\nemployee  is  otherwise  within  the exemption,  the  act  of\ncompelling the high policymaking  employee to retire does not\nconstitute an act of discrimination.\n    It   also  forecloses   his  argument  that   the  Bank's\nmodification   of   his   benefits   should  be   viewed   as\n\"manipulation.\"  In support of this argument, Morrissey urges\nthe  case of  Passer v.

The court\n\nalso ordered  Morrissey to  file a  more specific  Rule 56(f)\n\naffidavit.   Morrissey  responded  by  filing a  supplemental\n\nmemorandum  and affidavits  by  four  individuals,6 which  he\n\ncontends clearly demonstrated that he was removed from a high\n\npolicymaking   position  when  Blampied   became  CEO.    The\n\nmemorandum   also  requested   permission  to   depose  these\n\nindividuals.   On appeal,  Morrissey  contends that,  because\n\nthese  affidavits  demonstrated  the existence  of  a genuine\n\ndispute  of material  fact,  the district  court should  have\n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.
