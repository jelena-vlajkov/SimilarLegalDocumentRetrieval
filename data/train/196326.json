This appeal  raises an  issue\r                    SELYA,  Circuit Judge.\r                                         \r\n\nwhich, but for its  effect on the parties  before us, might  well\r\n\ndeserve  a  place  among  the inhabitants  of  Madame  Tussauds's\r\n\nWaxworks.  The tale follows.\r\n\n          We begin with basic bankruptcy bromides.  Chapter 13 of\r\n\nthe Bankruptcy  Code, 11 U.S.C.     1301-1330, enables individual\r\n\ndebtors to reorganize  their financial affairs,  so to speak,  by\r\n\nextending due  dates  and servicing  their  debts out  of  future\r\n\nincome pursuant to  a payment plan crafted  under the supervision\r\n\nof the bankruptcy court.  In contrast, Chapter 7 of  the Code, 11\r\n\nU.S.C.    701-766, provides for what is commonly termed \"straight\r\n\nbankruptcy.\"    It contemplates  the  liquidation  of a  debtor's\r\n\nestate, the  distribution  of  available assets  to  his  or  her\r\n\ncreditors,   and   ultimate   relief  from   liability   for  all\r\n\ndischargeable  debts.   Because the  two chapters mark  a natural\r\n\nprogression   from  difficult  financial  straits  to  unpassable\r\n\nfinancial straits, a proceeding under Chapter 13 may be converted\r\n\ninto  a proceeding under Chapter  7 if the  reorganization of the\r\n\ndebtor's affairs founders.  See 11 U.S.C.   1307.\r                                         \r\n\n          When such a conversion occurs, the Chapter 7 proceeding\r\n\n\"relates back\" in the sense that the Chapter 7 petition is deemed\r\n\nto have been filed on the filing date of the  original Chapter 13\r\n\npetition.  See 11  U.S.C.   348(a).   An enigma arises,  however,\r                        \r\n\nwhere  a  debtor has  earned income  during  the pendency  of the\r\n\nChapter  13 petition,  because the  statutory mosaic  makes clear\r\n\nthat  a Chapter 13 estate includes post-petition earnings, see 11\r                                                                        \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nU.S.C.    1306(a)(2), and  a Chapter 7  estate does  not, see  11\r                                                                       \r\n\nU.S.C.   541(a).  Therein  lies the rub.  For many  years, courts\r\n\ncould  not agree on  an answer to  the question  of whether post-\r\n\npetition income paid to  a Chapter 13 trustee became  property of\r\n\nthe  Chapter 7 estate  on conversion of  an insolvency proceeding\r\n\nfrom  a workout to a straight bankruptcy, even though such income\r\n\nwould  not be  property of  the estate  had the  debtor initially\r\n\nfiled his  or her petition  under Chapter  7.  In  this case  the\r\n\nlower courts ruled  that such post-petition income  inures to the\r\n\nbenefit of the Chapter 7 trustee.  This appeal ensued.\r\n\n          The material facts are undisputed.  The debtors, Derald\r\n\nand  Mary Young, owned and operated  a conglomeration of business\r\n\nenterprises  including Damn  Yankee Gifts, Damn  Yankee Balloons,\r\n\nDamn  Yankee Pewter, and Damn  Yankee Sheepskin.   On October 22,\r\n\n1992, the Youngs petitioned for relief from their creditors under\r\n\nChapter  13.   A  payment plan  emerged.   The  bankruptcy  court\r\n\napproved it, and the debtors agreed to abide by it.\r\n\n          While attempting to satisfy the  terms of the plan, Mr.\r\n\nand Mrs. Young tendered a total of $24,498 in interim earnings to\r\n\nthe  Chapter 13 trustee.   But, to paraphrase  the Scottish poet,\r\n\nthe best-laid plans  of creditors and debtors often go awry.  Cf.\r                                                                           \r\n\nRobert Burns, To a Mouse (1785).  The payment plan collapsed when\r                                  \r\n\nthe Youngs found themselves  unable to sell off certain  assets. \r\n\nKey Bank of Maine,  a secured creditor, took steps to protect its\r\n\ninterests and,  over the debtors' objection,  forced a conversion\r\n\nof the  Chapter 13  proceeding into a  straight bankruptcy  under\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nChapter 7.\r\n\n          The Youngs subsequently moved to determine the property\r\n\nof the  Chapter 7 estate in  order to settle the  status of their\r\n\npost-petition  contribution.   Initially,  the  bankruptcy  court\r\n\naccepted the debtors' position  and held that the funds  were the\r\n\nproperty of  the Chapter  13 trustee.    On reconsideration,  the\r\n\ncourt revoked its  earlier order  and decided,  favorably to  Key\r\n\nBank, that the  funds were the property of the  Chapter 7 estate.\r\n\nOn July 20,  1994, the bankruptcy  judge entered a  new order  to\r\n\nthat effect.  The  debtors appealed to the district  court, which\r\n\nupheld the July 20 order.  We now reverse.\r\n\n          At  the  time  the  events leading  to  this  conundrum\r\n\noccurred, the authorities were divided.  Many courts held, as did\r\n\nthe courts  below, that post-petition earnings  comprised part of\r\n\nthe Chapter 7 estate  when a Chapter 13 proceeding  was converted\r\n\nto a straight bankruptcy.  See, e.g., In re Calder, 973 F.2d 862,\r                                                            \r\n\n866 (10th  Cir. 1992); In re Lybrook, 951 F.2d 136, 137 (7th Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1991); In re Tracy, 28 B.R.  189, 190 (Bankr. D.Me. 1983).  Other\r                            \r\n\ncourts espoused the opposite view.  See, e.g., In re Bobroff, 766\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  797, 803 (3d  Cir. 1985); In  re Borrero, 75  B.R. 141, 142\r                                                        \r\n\n(Bankr. D.P.R. 1987);  In re  Peters, 44 B.R.  68, 70-72  (Bankr.\r                                              \r\n\nM.D.Tenn.   1984).1     The  division   in  the   authorities  is\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1In yet  a third variation on  the theme, a  few courts held\r\nthat  if  post-petition  earnings  were  accumulated  before  the\r\nconfirmation of a  Chapter 13  payment plan, such  funds did  not\r\nbecome property of the  Chapter 7 estate upon conversion;  but if\r\nthe funds were earned  subsequent to the confirmation of  a plan,\r\nthey  would then  become property  of the  Chapter 7  estate upon\r\nconversion.   See,  e.g., In  re Schmeltz,  114 B.R.  607, 610-13\r                                                   \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nunderstandable.  The question  is excruciatingly close, respected\r\n\njurists disagree  as to how it can best be answered, and as Judge\r\n\nPosner acknowledged,  the arguments on  either side  of the  line\r\n\noffer  \"equally good alternative[s].\"   Lybrook, 951 F.2d at 137.\r                                                         \r\n\nThus, for all intents and purposes the law was indeterminate when\r\n\nthis question  came before  the courts  below,  and those  courts\r\n\nresolved the indeterminacy in a plausible way.\r\n\n          Nevertheless,  judges  sometimes   view  issues   quite\r\n\ndifferently,  and our  responsibility  to the  parties before  us\r\n\nrequires  that, on  a  matter of  law  committed to  our  plenary\r\n\nreview, see In  re G.S.F. Corp.,  938 F.2d  1467, 1474 (1st  Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1991), we must interpret the applicable statutes as we read them,\r\n\nconsistent  with our exposition of discerned congressional intent\r\n\nand  without  paying  special  deference  to  the  courts  below.\r\n\nFulfilling  our  proper  function  here, we  reach  a  conclusion\r\n\ncontrary to that reached by the bankruptcy judge and the district\r\n\njudge.  Consequently, we hold that post-petition income earned by\r\n\nand contributed  to a Chapter 13  estate (prior to  the change in\r\n\nthe  law discussed  infra) did  not, upon  the conversion  of the\r                                   \r\n\nproceeding  to  a straight  bankruptcy,  become  property of  the\r\n\nChapter 7 estate.\r\n\n          At this point, the plot thickens.  Ordinarily, we would\r\n\nnow proceed to present an analysis of the bases for our decision,\r\n\nexplicating  our   reasoning  in   suitable  detail.     But  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n(Bankr.  N.D.Ind. 1990); In re  Holly, 109 B.R.  524, 526 (Bankr.\r                                               \r\nS.D.Ga. 1989);  In  re  Richardson,  20  B.R.  490,  492  (Bankr.\r                                            \r\nW.D.N.Y. 1982).\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\ncircumstances of this case are well out of the ordinary, and they\r\n\ncounsel a different, more muted course.  We explain briefly.\r\n\n          Perhaps  because of  the split  in authority  about how\r\n\nbest  to synchronize  Chapter 13  and Chapter  7,  Congress acted\r\n\nwithin  the past year to demystify the situation.  The Bankruptcy\r\n\nReform  Act of 1994 answered the very question that confronts us.\r\n\nIt essentially  codified the  Bobroff rule, enacting  a statutory\r                                               \r\n\nprovision designed to  ensure that, on conversion from  a Chapter\r\n\n13 proceeding,\r\n\n          property of the estate in  the converted case\r\n          shall consist of property  of the estate,  as\r\n          of the  date of filing of  the petition, that\r\n          remains in the possession  of or is under the\r\n          control  of   the  debtor  on   the  date  of\r\n          conversion.\r\n\n11 U.S.C.   348(f)(1)(A) (1994).   In all future cases, this rule\r\n\n(subject to  a statutory  \"bad  faith\" exception  not of  concern\r\n\nhere) will govern.   But the newly crafted statute does not apply\r\n\nin  this  case:    the  Bankruptcy  Reform  Act  explicitly  bars\r\n\nretroactive  application of  the statutory  solution  to accruals\r\n\nantedating the Act's effective date (October 22, 1994).  See Pub.\r                                                                      \r\n\nL. No.  103-394,   702, 108  Stat. 4106, 4150.   The Youngs filed\r\n\ntheir  Chapter  13 petition  exactly two  years earlier,  and the\r\n\nChapter 13 trustee had the disputed funds in hand well before the\r\n\namendment's effective date.   As a result, section 348(f)  is not\r\n\ncontrolling in this case.\r\n\n          Be  that as  it may,  it ill  behooves us  to play  the\r\n\nostrich, struthiously pretending that the neoteric statute is not\r\n\nnow in force.  Though the  amendment does not affect the  outcome\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nof  this appeal,  it  punctuates our  opinion  and strips  it  of\r\n\nvirtually  all precedential  value.   Where, as  here, we  face a\r\n\nlingering question of law that is defunct except  as to a handful\r\n\nof ongoing cases, we see no point in writing at  length either to\r\n\nelucidate our  rationale  or to  justify our  construction of  an\r\n\nambiguous  statute  that  Congress  has  lately  taken  pains  to\r\n\nclarify.  Cf. In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel  Fire Litig., 989\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 36, 38 (1st  Cir. 1993) (suggesting that an  appellate court\r\n\nshould  not  write  opinions  \"simply   to  hear  its  own  words\r\n\nresonate\").  This is  especially true in the instant  case, since\r\n\nother  courts  have  spelled   out  the  reasons  supporting  our\r\n\nconclusion.  See Bobroff, 766 F.2d at 803; Peters, 44 B.R. at 70-\r                                                           \r\n\n72.

This appeal  raises an  issue\r                    SELYA,  Circuit Judge.\r                                         \r\n\nwhich, but for its  effect on the parties  before us, might  well\r\n\ndeserve  a  place  among  the inhabitants  of  Madame  Tussauds's\r\n\nWaxworks.  The tale follows.\r\n\n          We begin with basic bankruptcy bromides.  Chapter 13 of\r\n\nthe Bankruptcy  Code, 11 U.S.C.     1301-1330, enables individual\r\n\ndebtors to reorganize  their financial affairs,  so to speak,  by\r\n\nextending due  dates  and servicing  their  debts out  of  future\r\n\nincome pursuant to  a payment plan crafted  under the supervision\r\n\nof the bankruptcy court.  In contrast, Chapter 7 of  the Code, 11\r\n\nU.S.C.    701-766, provides for what is commonly termed \"straight\r\n\nbankruptcy.\"    It contemplates  the  liquidation  of a  debtor's\r\n\nestate, the  distribution  of  available assets  to  his  or  her\r\n\ncreditors,   and   ultimate   relief  from   liability   for  all\r\n\ndischargeable  debts.   Because the  two chapters mark  a natural\r\n\nprogression   from  difficult  financial  straits  to  unpassable\r\n\nfinancial straits, a proceeding under Chapter 13 may be converted\r\n\ninto  a proceeding under Chapter  7 if the  reorganization of the\r\n\ndebtor's affairs founders.  See 11 U.S.C.   1307.\r                                         \r\n\n          When such a conversion occurs, the Chapter 7 proceeding\r\n\n\"relates back\" in the sense that the Chapter 7 petition is deemed\r\n\nto have been filed on the filing date of the  original Chapter 13\r\n\npetition.  See 11  U.S.C.   348(a).   An enigma arises,  however,\r                        \r\n\nwhere  a  debtor has  earned income  during  the pendency  of the\r\n\nChapter  13 petition,  because the  statutory mosaic  makes clear\r\n\nthat  a Chapter 13 estate includes post-petition earnings, see 11\r                                                                        \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nU.S.C.    1306(a)(2), and  a Chapter 7  estate does  not, see  11\r                                                                       \r\n\nU.S.C.   541(a).  Therein  lies the rub.  For many  years, courts\r\n\ncould  not agree on  an answer to  the question  of whether post-\r\n\npetition income paid to  a Chapter 13 trustee became  property of\r\n\nthe  Chapter 7 estate  on conversion of  an insolvency proceeding\r\n\nfrom  a workout to a straight bankruptcy, even though such income\r\n\nwould  not be  property of  the estate  had the  debtor initially\r\n\nfiled his  or her petition  under Chapter  7.  In  this case  the\r\n\nlower courts ruled  that such post-petition income  inures to the\r\n\nbenefit of the Chapter 7 trustee.  This appeal ensued.\r\n\n          The material facts are undisputed.  The debtors, Derald\r\n\nand  Mary Young, owned and operated  a conglomeration of business\r\n\nenterprises  including Damn  Yankee Gifts, Damn  Yankee Balloons,\r\n\nDamn  Yankee Pewter, and Damn  Yankee Sheepskin.   On October 22,\r\n\n1992, the Youngs petitioned for relief from their creditors under\r\n\nChapter  13.   A  payment plan  emerged.   The  bankruptcy  court\r\n\napproved it, and the debtors agreed to abide by it.\r\n\n          While attempting to satisfy the  terms of the plan, Mr.\r\n\nand Mrs. Young tendered a total of $24,498 in interim earnings to\r\n\nthe  Chapter 13 trustee.   But, to paraphrase  the Scottish poet,\r\n\nthe best-laid plans  of creditors and debtors often go awry.  Cf.\r                                                                           \r\n\nRobert Burns, To a Mouse (1785).  The payment plan collapsed when\r                                  \r\n\nthe Youngs found themselves  unable to sell off certain  assets. \r\n\nKey Bank of Maine,  a secured creditor, took steps to protect its\r\n\ninterests and,  over the debtors' objection,  forced a conversion\r\n\nof the  Chapter 13  proceeding into a  straight bankruptcy  under\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nChapter 7.\r\n\n          The Youngs subsequently moved to determine the property\r\n\nof the  Chapter 7 estate in  order to settle the  status of their\r\n\npost-petition  contribution.   Initially,  the  bankruptcy  court\r\n\naccepted the debtors' position  and held that the funds  were the\r\n\nproperty of  the Chapter  13 trustee.    On reconsideration,  the\r\n\ncourt revoked its  earlier order  and decided,  favorably to  Key\r\n\nBank, that the  funds were the property of the  Chapter 7 estate.\r\n\nOn July 20,  1994, the bankruptcy  judge entered a  new order  to\r\n\nthat effect.  The  debtors appealed to the district  court, which\r\n\nupheld the July 20 order.  We now reverse.\r\n\n          At  the  time  the  events leading  to  this  conundrum\r\n\noccurred, the authorities were divided.  Many courts held, as did\r\n\nthe courts  below, that post-petition earnings  comprised part of\r\n\nthe Chapter 7 estate  when a Chapter 13 proceeding  was converted\r\n\nto a straight bankruptcy.

We explain briefly.\r\n\n          Perhaps  because of  the split  in authority  about how\r\n\nbest  to synchronize  Chapter 13  and Chapter  7,  Congress acted\r\n\nwithin  the past year to demystify the situation.  The Bankruptcy\r\n\nReform  Act of 1994 answered the very question that confronts us.\r\n\nIt essentially  codified the  Bobroff rule, enacting  a statutory\r                                               \r\n\nprovision designed to  ensure that, on conversion from  a Chapter\r\n\n13 proceeding,\r\n\n          property of the estate in  the converted case\r\n          shall consist of property  of the estate,  as\r\n          of the  date of filing of  the petition, that\r\n          remains in the possession  of or is under the\r\n          control  of   the  debtor  on   the  date  of\r\n          conversion.\r\n\n11 U.S.C.   348(f)(1)(A) (1994).   In all future cases, this rule\r\n\n(subject to  a statutory  \"bad  faith\" exception  not of  concern\r\n\nhere) will govern.   But the newly crafted statute does not apply\r\n\nin  this  case:    the  Bankruptcy  Reform  Act  explicitly  bars\r\n\nretroactive  application of  the statutory  solution  to accruals\r\n\nantedating the Act's effective date (October 22, 1994).  See Pub.\r                                                                      \r\n\nL. No.  103-394,   702, 108  Stat. 4106, 4150.   The Youngs filed\r\n\ntheir  Chapter  13 petition  exactly two  years earlier,  and the\r\n\nChapter 13 trustee had the disputed funds in hand well before the\r\n\namendment's effective date.   As a result, section 348(f)  is not\r\n\ncontrolling in this case.\r\n\n          Be  that as  it may,  it ill  behooves us  to play  the\r\n\nostrich, struthiously pretending that the neoteric statute is not\r\n\nnow in force.  Though the  amendment does not affect the  outcome\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nof  this appeal,  it  punctuates our  opinion  and strips  it  of\r\n\nvirtually  all precedential  value.   Where, as  here, we  face a\r\n\nlingering question of law that is defunct except  as to a handful\r\n\nof ongoing cases, we see no point in writing at  length either to\r\n\nelucidate our  rationale  or to  justify our  construction of  an\r\n\nambiguous  statute  that  Congress  has  lately  taken  pains  to\r\n\nclarify.
