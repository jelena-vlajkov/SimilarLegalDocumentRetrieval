In  April 1994, defendant  Ramon Prudencio\r                           \n\nVanegas pled guilty to a charge of possessing, with intent to\n\ndistribute, over 100 kilograms of marijuana on board a vessel\n\nsubject  to  the  jurisdiction   of  the  United  States,  in\n\nviolation of 46  U.S.C. App.   1903(a).   In August  1994, he\n\nwas sentenced to a prison term of 87 months.  Throughout this\n\nperiod,  defendant  (a   57-year-old  citizen  of   Colombia)\n\nsuffered   from   a  hearing   impairment   and   a  prostate\n\ncondition.1   Anticipating that  his medical  condition would\n\nbe a relevant factor  at sentencing, he sought  permission in\n\nMay 1994 to retain a physician to provide him with a complete\n\nassessment thereof.   This motion was denied,  and the matter\n\nwas not thereafter pursued.   Defendant now appeals, alleging\n\nthat  the district court erred  in denying this  request.  We\n\nfind no abuse of discretion and therefore affirm.\n\n     Defendant complains  that the lack of  a private medical\n\nevaluation  hampered  his  ability  to argue  for  a  reduced\n\nsentence in  light of his ailments.2  This contention falters\n\nfor  at  least two  reasons.   First,  far from  objecting at\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  The  hearing  impairment  resulted  in  partial  loss  of\nhearing.  The prostate condition, according to defendant, was\ndiagnosed  in a  May  1994 prison  medical  report as  benign\nprostate hypertrophy  (enlargement),  which caused  no  major\npain or discomfort.\n\n2.  He  similarly complains  that  the denial  of his  motion\nprevented   him  from  negotiating   a  more  favorable  plea\nagreement with the government.  It is difficult to understand\nhow,  since the  plea agreement  was completed  several weeks\nbefore his motion was filed.   \n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nsentencing  to the  state  of the  medical evidence,  defense\n\ncounsel acknowledged  that  the matter  had been  \"adequately\n\naddressed.\"  Second, the district  court ended up agreeing to\n\na  two-level  downward departure  on  account of  defendant's\n\nhealth and  age (going beyond the government's recommendation\n\nfor a one-level departure  in this regard).  See  U.S.S.G.   \r                                                            \n\n5H1.1,  5H1.4.3    It  also  recommended  that  defendant  be\n\nconfined   at  an   institution  equipped   with  appropriate\n\ntreatment  facilities.   By  these  and  other actions,4  the\n\ncourt evinced an obvious appreciation of defendant's  medical\n\nsituation.\n\n     Defendant  also  suggests  that his  hearing  impairment\n\nprevented  him from  fully understanding  what transpired  at\n\nsentencing.    Yet  the  district court  was  aware  of  this\n\ncondition, having  advised the  interpreter at the  outset to\n\nspeak  firmly   since   \"defendant  is   hard  of   hearing.\"\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  Ordinarily,  a defendant  who receives  the benefit  of a\ndownward  departure  cannot appeal  on  the  ground that  the\ndeparture was  not sufficiently  liberal.  See,  e.g., United\r                                                                         \nStates v.  Pighetti, 898 F.2d  3, 4 (1st  Cir. 1990).   Here,\r                               \nhowever,  defendant does not appeal his  sentence per se, but\r                                                                    \nappeals the  denial  of  his  motion  for  appointment  of  a\nphysician.  Since  the outcome is the  same in any event,  we\nassume--but   do   not   decide--that   we   have   appellate\njurisdiction.\n\n4.  Shortly  after  entering his  guilty plea,  defendant had\nfiled  a \"motion  requesting medical  treatment\" in  which he\ncomplained that prison authorities had not  properly attended\nto  his  medical needs.   The  court  allowed the  motion and\nordered that  defendant be provided  with whatever  treatment\n\"his condition may require.\"\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nDefendant's replies to the court's  inquiries were responsive\n\nin nature, reflecting no  difficulties in comprehension.  And\n\nneither defendant  nor counsel  voiced any complaint  in this\n\nregard.  This contention thus falters as well.\n\n     Affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\r                                             \n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
