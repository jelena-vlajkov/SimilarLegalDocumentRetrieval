We affirm the decision of the district court.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The  following facts  are  not in  dispute.   Local  66\r\n\nrepresents laundry workers in the Somerville, Massachusetts area.\r\n\nOn  August  25,  1993,  Local   66  wrote  to  the  International\r\n\nrequesting its approval to disaffiliate from the International in\r\n\norder  to reaffiliate  with  the Amalgamated  Clothing &amp;  Textile\r\n\nWorkers International  Union (\"ACTWU\").  The International denied\r\n\nLocal 66's request.   Thereafter, Local 66's membership voted  to\r\n\ndisaffiliate,  and Local  66 informed  the International  of this\r\n\ndecision on November 18, 1994.\r\n\n          In response, the International declared that, under its\r\n\nconstitution,  an emergency existed with regard to Local 66.  The\r\n\nInternational suspended all of  Local 66's officers and appointed\r\n\na trustee over Local 66.  Local 66 did not recognize the trustee,\r\n\nand also refused to  turn over its books, records,  bank accounts\r\n\nand premises.\r\n\n          On  December  12,  1994,  the   International  filed  a\r\n\ncomplaint  requesting  injunctive  relief  to  force  Local  66's\r\n\nofficers to  recognize the  trustee.  The  district court  denied\r\n\n                               -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nthis request in its Order of January 26, 1995.  When the district\r\n\ncourt made  its decision,  the merits  of the  underlying dispute\r\n\nwere  before the National Labor Relations  Board, which has since\r\n\ndecided that Local 66  (now \"Local 66L,\" but referred  to in this\r\n\nopinion as \"Local  66\") will  represent the workers  as an  ACTWU\r\n\naffiliate.     See  Aramark  Uniform  Services,  Case  1-CA-32465\r                                                        \r\n\n(N.L.R.B.  May 10,  1995) (memorandum  also  addressing companion\r\n\ncases).   Here,  the International  appeals the  district court's\r\n\ndecision denying injunctive relief.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n            We review a  district court's denial of  a motion for\r\n\npreliminary injunction  only for \"abuse of  discretion\" or \"clear\r\n\nerror\"  of fact  or  related law.

Caribbean\r                                                                           \r\n\nPetroleum,  990 F.2d 25,  26 (1st Cir.  1993); Planned Parenthood\r                                                                           \r\n\nLeague of Mass. v. Bellotti, 641 F.2d 1006, 1009 (1st Cir. 1981).\r                                     \r\n\n          To  be  entitled  to   a  preliminary  injunction,  the\r\n\nInternational  had to show the  district court (1)  that it would\r\n\nsuffer irreparable harm  if the injunction were  not granted; (2)\r\n\nthat such  injury outweighed  any harm which  granting injunctive\r\n\nrelief  would  inflict on  the  defendant;  (3) a  likelihood  of\r\n\nsuccess on the merits; and (4) that the public interest would not\r\n\nbe adversely affected by granting the injunction.  See, e.g., Pye\r                                                                           \r\n\non  Behalf of NLRB  v. Sullivan Bros.,  38 F.3d 58,  63 (1st Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1994);  Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Guilbert, 934 F.2d 4, 5 (1st\r                                                       \r\n\nCir. 1991).\r\n\n                               -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n          The district court denied the International's motion on\r\n\nthe  grounds  that  the   International  failed  to  show  either\r\n\nlikelihood that it would succeed  on the merits or that it  would\r\n\nsuffer  irreparable harm  if the  injunction did  not issue.   In\r\n\nparticular,  the   district  court  found  that   contrary  to  a\r\n\nlikelihood of  success, the International  was likely to  fail on\r\n\nthe  merits  since  the  trusteeship aimed  at  the  illegitimate\r\n\npurpose of  preventing Local 66's disaffiliation.   Additionally,\r\n\nthe district court found that the true harm to the International,\r\n\nthe loss of  the workers in Local 66, had already occurred, while\r\n\nthe harm  that the  International claimed, inability  to exercise\r\n\nits rights under its constitution, was merely \"symbolic.\"\r\n\n          On appeal,  the International  responds that it  is not\r\n\ntrying to  use  the trusteeship  to prevent  disaffiliation.   It\r\n\nexplains that  since disaffiliation  has already taken  place, it\r\n\nsimply  wishes to recover the property, books, and records of the\r\n\nentity it terms \"Local  66, Laundry Workers,\" which it  claims is\r\n\nstill  extant.  As a result of this asserted continued existence,\r\n\nthe International  further argues  that its trusteeship  is valid\r\n\nand  it  will likely  succeed on  the  merits.   Furthermore, the\r\n\nInternational contends that it is favored by the balance of harms\r\n\ntest, since this  test requires that  the International be  given\r\n\nthe sought-after assets  in order  to compete with  Local 66  for\r\n\nworker support.\r\n\n                               -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n          The validity  of a  trusteeship, as the  district court\r\n\nrecognized, is  governed by Section  462 of the  Labor Management\r\n\nReporting and Disclosure Act, which states that:\r\n\n            Trusteeships  shall  be  established  and\r\n            administered by a labor organization over\r\n            a  subordinate  body  only in  accordance\r\n            with the constitution  and bylaws of  the\r\n            organization     which    has     assumed\r\n            trusteeship over the subordinate body and\r\n            for the purpose of  correcting corruption\r\n            or  financial  malpractice, assuring  the\r\n            performance   of  collective   bargaining\r\n            agreements   or   other   duties   of   a\r\n            bargaining    representative,   restoring\r\n            democratic   procedures,   or   otherwise\r\n            carrying  out  the legitimate  objects of\r\n            such labor organization.\r\n\n29  U.S.C.    462  (1988).    Section  462  sets  forth  specific\r\n\nlegitimate  reasons for  imposing a  trusteeship that  benefits a\r\n\nunion's   membership,  including:     correcting   corruption  or\r\n\nfinancial  malpractice;  assuring the  performance  of collective\r\n\nbargaining agreements  or other bargaining  duties; and restoring\r\n\ndemocratic  procedures.    Id.     However,  courts  have  widely\r                                        \r\n\nrecognized that preventing disaffiliation is not a proper purpose\r\n\nunder   462 for the  imposition of a trustee.

Tex.\r                                         \r\n\n1987).\r\n\n                               -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n          The International correctly contends that   462 confers\r\n\non its trustee  a presumption  of validity, unless  Local 66  can\r\n\nshow by  clear and convincing  evidence that the  trusteeship was\r\n\nnot established  in good faith for  a purpose under the  Act.  29\r\n\nU.S.C.    464(c) (1988).1  However, the district court found that\r\n\nLocal 66 had  met this  burden, since the  International made  no\r\n\nallegations and  presented no  evidence of financial  misdeeds or\r\n\nother  factors  that would  support  a  trusteeship.   While  the\r\n\nInternational argues  that the trusteeship was  imposed after the\r                                                                       \r\n\ndisaffiliation, and  thus could not prevent it,  we conclude that\r\n\nby denying Local 66 current access to  its records and funds, the\r\n\nInternational  could  forestall  Local  66's  attempts  to   gain\r\n\nrecognition from employers as  a bargaining agent affiliated with\r\n\nACTWU.  The strongest evidence was that  the International sought\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Which states that:\r\n\n              In  any  proceeding  pursuant  to  this\r\n            section  a  trusteeship established  by a\r\n            labor organization in conformity with the\r\n            procedural     requirements    of     its\r\n            constitution and bylaws and authorized or\r\n            ratified  after  a  fair  hearing  either\r\n            before the executive board or before such\r\n            other   body  as   may  be   provided  in\r\n            accordance   with  its   constitution  or\r\n            bylaws  shall  be  presumed  valid  for a\r\n            period of eighteen  months from the  date\r\n            of  its establishment  and  shall not  be\r\n            subject  to  attack  during  such  period\r\n            except  upon  clear and  convincing proof\r\n            that the trusteeship was  not established\r\n            or maintained in good faith for a purpose\r\n            allowable  under  section  462   of  this\r\n            title.\r\n\nId.\r             \r\n\n                               -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nthe  trusteeship to  influence  the matter  of the  disaffilation\r\n\nvote.\r\n\n          On  appeal,  the International  also  contends  that it\r\n\nrequires  the books  and  records in  order  for its  \"Local  66,\r\n\nLaundry Workers\" to continue representing workers, a valid reason\r\n\nfor  a trusteeship under   462.   However, the district court has\r\n\nalready found  that the International and  its appointed trustees\r\n\nwere not representing workers  after the disaffiliation, but were\r\n\ninstead sitting atop  an \"empty  shell.\"  The  district court  so\r\n\ndetermined based on evidence that 98 percent of those voting from\r\n\nLocal 66 had  voted to disaffiliate and  that in less than  three\r\n\nmonths all  but two of  fifteen employers  had already  expressed\r\n\nwillingness  to recognize  Local 66  as an  ACTWU affiliate.   We\r\n\nuphold  the  district court's  factual  finding  that \"Local  66,\r\n\nLaundry  Workers\" is an empty shell as not clearly erroneous, and\r\n\nthus reject the International's argument that it needs the assets\r\n\nfor ongoing representation.\r\n\n          We also  uphold the  district court's finding  that the\r\n\nbalance  of   harms  test  favors  denying  the   motion  for  an\r\n\ninjunction.    On appeal,  the  International  contends that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court failed  to  recognize the  irreparable harm  that\r\n\nresulted  from being deprived of the assets in question while the\r\n\nInternational  had bargaining  rights to  protect.   However, the\r\n\ndistrict  court  recognized  that  Local 66,  ACTWU  was  already\r\n\nrepresenting  the bulk of the  employees in question,  and so the\r\n\nbalance of  harms  favored denying  the  injunction.   While  the\r\n\n                               -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nInternational may indeed have been inhibited in competing for the\r\n\nworkers' representation,  that harm does not  outweigh the danger\r\n\nof obstructing  their actual  current representation.   We uphold\r\n\nthe district court's  finding.2  For  the foregoing reasons,  the\r\n\njudgment  of the  district court  is affirmed.

Local  66\r\n\nrepresents laundry workers in the Somerville, Massachusetts area.\r\n\nOn  August  25,  1993,  Local   66  wrote  to  the  International\r\n\nrequesting its approval to disaffiliate from the International in\r\n\norder  to reaffiliate  with  the Amalgamated  Clothing &amp;  Textile\r\n\nWorkers International  Union (\"ACTWU\").  The International denied\r\n\nLocal 66's request.   Thereafter, Local 66's membership voted  to\r\n\ndisaffiliate,  and Local  66 informed  the International  of this\r\n\ndecision on November 18, 1994.\r\n\n          In response, the International declared that, under its\r\n\nconstitution,  an emergency existed with regard to Local 66.  The\r\n\nInternational suspended all of  Local 66's officers and appointed\r\n\na trustee over Local 66.  Local 66 did not recognize the trustee,\r\n\nand also refused to  turn over its books, records,  bank accounts\r\n\nand premises.\r\n\n          On  December  12,  1994,  the   International  filed  a\r\n\ncomplaint  requesting  injunctive  relief  to  force  Local  66's\r\n\nofficers to  recognize the  trustee.  The  district court  denied\r\n\n                               -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nthis request in its Order of January 26, 1995.  When the district\r\n\ncourt made  its decision,  the merits  of the  underlying dispute\r\n\nwere  before the National Labor Relations  Board, which has since\r\n\ndecided that Local 66  (now \"Local 66L,\" but referred  to in this\r\n\nopinion as \"Local  66\") will  represent the workers  as an  ACTWU\r\n\naffiliate.     See  Aramark  Uniform  Services,  Case  1-CA-32465\r                                                        \r\n\n(N.L.R.B.  May 10,  1995) (memorandum  also  addressing companion\r\n\ncases).   Here,  the International  appeals the  district court's\r\n\ndecision denying injunctive relief.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n            We review a  district court's denial of  a motion for\r\n\npreliminary injunction  only for \"abuse of  discretion\" or \"clear\r\n\nerror\"  of fact  or  related law.

In\r\n\nparticular,  the   district  court  found  that   contrary  to  a\r\n\nlikelihood of  success, the International  was likely to  fail on\r\n\nthe  merits  since  the  trusteeship aimed  at  the  illegitimate\r\n\npurpose of  preventing Local 66's disaffiliation.   Additionally,\r\n\nthe district court found that the true harm to the International,\r\n\nthe loss of  the workers in Local 66, had already occurred, while\r\n\nthe harm  that the  International claimed, inability  to exercise\r\n\nits rights under its constitution, was merely \"symbolic.\"\r\n\n          On appeal,  the International  responds that it  is not\r\n\ntrying to  use  the trusteeship  to prevent  disaffiliation.   It\r\n\nexplains that  since disaffiliation  has already taken  place, it\r\n\nsimply  wishes to recover the property, books, and records of the\r\n\nentity it terms \"Local  66, Laundry Workers,\" which it  claims is\r\n\nstill  extant.  As a result of this asserted continued existence,\r\n\nthe International  further argues  that its trusteeship  is valid\r\n\nand  it  will likely  succeed on  the  merits.   Furthermore, the\r\n\nInternational contends that it is favored by the balance of harms\r\n\ntest, since this  test requires that  the International be  given\r\n\nthe sought-after assets  in order  to compete with  Local 66  for\r\n\nworker support.\r\n\n                               -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n          The validity  of a  trusteeship, as the  district court\r\n\nrecognized, is  governed by Section  462 of the  Labor Management\r\n\nReporting and Disclosure Act, which states that:\r\n\n            Trusteeships  shall  be  established  and\r\n            administered by a labor organization over\r\n            a  subordinate  body  only in  accordance\r\n            with the constitution  and bylaws of  the\r\n            organization     which    has     assumed\r\n            trusteeship over the subordinate body and\r\n            for the purpose of  correcting corruption\r\n            or  financial  malpractice, assuring  the\r\n            performance   of  collective   bargaining\r\n            agreements   or   other   duties   of   a\r\n            bargaining    representative,   restoring\r\n            democratic   procedures,   or   otherwise\r\n            carrying  out  the legitimate  objects of\r\n            such labor organization.\r\n\n29  U.S.C.    462  (1988).    Section  462  sets  forth  specific\r\n\nlegitimate  reasons for  imposing a  trusteeship that  benefits a\r\n\nunion's   membership,  including:     correcting   corruption  or\r\n\nfinancial  malpractice;  assuring the  performance  of collective\r\n\nbargaining agreements  or other bargaining  duties; and restoring\r\n\ndemocratic  procedures.    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561828\"><a href=\"/opinion/561828/narragansett-indian-tribe-v-paul-e-guilbert/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>     However,  courts </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> have  widely\r                                        \r\n\nrecognized that preventing disaffiliation is not a proper purpose\r\n\nunder   462 for the  imposition of a trustee.

While  the\r\n\nInternational argues  that the trusteeship was  imposed after the\r                                                                       \r\n\ndisaffiliation, and  thus could not prevent it,  we conclude that\r\n\nby denying Local 66 current access to  its records and funds, the\r\n\nInternational  could  forestall  Local  66's  attempts  to   gain\r\n\nrecognition from employers as  a bargaining agent affiliated with\r\n\nACTWU.  The strongest evidence was that  the International sought\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Which states that:\r\n\n              In  any  proceeding  pursuant  to  this\r\n            section  a  trusteeship established  by a\r\n            labor organization in conformity with the\r\n            procedural     requirements    of     its\r\n            constitution and bylaws and authorized or\r\n            ratified  after  a  fair  hearing  either\r\n            before the executive board or before such\r\n            other   body  as   may  be   provided  in\r\n            accordance   with  its   constitution  or\r\n            bylaws  shall  be  presumed  valid  for a\r\n            period of eighteen  months from the  date\r\n            of  its establishment  and  shall not  be\r\n            subject  to  attack  during  such  period\r\n            except  upon  clear and  convincing proof\r\n            that the trusteeship was  not established\r\n            or maintained in good faith for a purpose\r\n            allowable  under  section  462   of  this\r\n            title.\r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1557537\"><a href=\"/opinion/1557537/intern-broth-of-boilermakers-v-local-lodge-d474/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\r             \r\n\n                               -6-\r                                         -6-\r</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\r\n\nthe  trusteeship to  influence  the matter  of the  disaffilation\r\n\nvote.\r\n\n          On  appeal,  the International  also  contends  that it\r\n\nrequires  the books  and  records in  order  for its  \"Local  66,\r\n\nLaundry Workers\" to continue representing workers, a valid reason\r\n\nfor  a trusteeship under   462.   However, the district court has\r\n\nalready found  that the International and  its appointed trustees\r\n\nwere not representing workers  after the disaffiliation, but were\r\n\ninstead sitting atop  an \"empty  shell.\"  The  district court  so\r\n\ndetermined based on evidence that 98 percent of those voting from\r\n\nLocal 66 had  voted to disaffiliate and  that in less than  three\r\n\nmonths all  but two of  fifteen employers  had already  expressed\r\n\nwillingness  to recognize  Local 66  as an  ACTWU affiliate.   We\r\n\nuphold  the  district court's  factual  finding  that \"Local  66,\r\n\nLaundry  Workers\" is an empty shell as not clearly erroneous, and\r\n\nthus reject the International's argument that it needs the assets\r\n\nfor ongoing representation.\r\n\n          We also  uphold the  district court's finding  that the\r\n\nbalance  of   harms  test  favors  denying  the   motion  for  an\r\n\ninjunction.    On appeal,  the  International  contends that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court failed  to  recognize the  irreparable harm  that\r\n\nresulted  from being deprived of the assets in question while the\r\n\nInternational  had bargaining  rights to  protect.   However, the\r\n\ndistrict  court  recognized  that  Local 66,  ACTWU  was  already\r\n\nrepresenting  the bulk of the  employees in question,  and so the\r\n\nbalance of  harms  favored denying  the  injunction.   While  the\r\n\n                               -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nInternational may indeed have been inhibited in competing for the\r\n\nworkers' representation,  that harm does not  outweigh the danger\r\n\nof obstructing  their actual  current representation.   We uphold\r\n\nthe district court's  finding.2  For  the foregoing reasons,  the\r\n\njudgment  of the  district court  is affirmed.   Double  costs to\r                                               affirmed.\r                                                       \r\n\nappellee.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  Appellant has asked for a status conference in order to settle\r\nthe question  of  its entitlement  to  the requested  records,  a\r\nrequest which the district court may consider at its discretion.\r\n\n                               -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n</pre>",
