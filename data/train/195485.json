Stern,  United  States  Attorney,  and  Ben   T.\n                                                               \nClements,  Assistant   United  States  Attorney,  on   brief  for\n      \nappellee.\n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n          Per Curiam.  Defendant-appellant Michael J. Ducoing\n                    \n\nwas  convicted of conspiracy  to commit bank  larceny, see 18\n                                                          \n\nU.S.C.   371, and bank robbery, see 18 U.S.C.   2113(a).  The\n                                   \n\ndistrict court  determined that Ducoing is  a career offender\n\nunder   the   Sentencing   Guidelines   and   sentenced   him\n\naccordingly.  Ducoing challenges  his sentence, claiming that\n\nthe district court erred in denying his motion for a downward\n\ndeparture, pursuant to U.S.S.G.   4A1.3, on  the grounds that\n\nhis  criminal  history   category  (VI)  over-represents  the\n\nseriousness of his criminal  record.  We dismiss for  lack of\n\njurisdiction.\n\n          We have  not addressed whether a downward departure\n\npursuant  to    4A1.3  is  permissible in  a  career offender\n\ncase.1   We need not resolve  this issue here.   The district\n\njudge  did express  \"serious doubts\"  about his  authority to\n\ndepart downward.  However,  he concluded that even if  he had\n\nthe authority to depart  downward, he should not do  so given\n\nthe  \"number  of  offenses  that qualify  here,\"  the  \"total\n\nrecord,\" and the policies behind the career offender statute,\n\n28 U.S.C.   994(h).   This latter finding, that the facts  do\n\nnot justify departing, constitutes a discretionary refusal to\n\n                    \n\n1.  A number of other circuits have held that such departures\nare permitted.  See, e.g., United States v. Beckham, 968 F.2d\n                                                   \n47, 54 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (citing  cases from the 4th, 8th, 9th\nand 10th circuits).   In United States v. Norflett,  922 F.2d\n                                                  \n50, 54 n.5 (1st Cir. 1990), we reserved the question whether,\nin view of 28  U.S.C.   994(h), departures are  prohibited in\ncareer offender cases. \n\n                             -2-\n\ndepart.   Since it is sufficient to support the sentence, the\n\ndistrict court's decision not to depart is unreviewable.  See\n                                                             \n\nUnited States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288, 292 (1st Cir.) (appeal\n                       \n\nwill not lie from a district court discretionary decision not\n\nto  depart), cert.  denied,  113 S.  Ct.  224 (1992);  United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Williams,  898  F.2d 1400,  1403  (9th Cir.  1990)\n                   \n\n(declining to  review district court's determination  that it\n\nhad  no authority to depart when court indicated it would not\n\ndepart even if it had authority to do  so).  Accordingly, the\n\nappeal is dismissed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.   \n                         \n\n                             -3-\n",
