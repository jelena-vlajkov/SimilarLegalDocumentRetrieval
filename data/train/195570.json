Defendant Geraldo O'Campo, a citizen of the\n               \n\nDominican  Republic, was  deported to  that country  in March\n\n1991 after  having been  convicted of various  drug offenses.\n\nHe   thereafter  returned   to  the  United   States  without\n\npermission.   Upon  being apprehended  in July  1992, he  was\n\nindicted on a single  count of violating 8 U.S.C.     1326(a)\n\nand  (b)(2).1  He subsequently pled guilty to this charge and\n\nreceived  a prison term of 46 months.  Defendant now advances\n\na single challenge to his sentence, arguing that the district\n\ncourt mistakenly concluded it  lacked the authority to depart\n\ndownward in one  particular respect.   We find  no error  and\n\ntherefore affirm.  See Loc. R. 27.1. \n                      \n\n                              I.\n\n     At issue  is a November 1,  1991 revision to    2L1.2 of\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines,  which governs  the offense  here.\n\nIn  its earlier form, this  section prescribed a base offense\n\nlevel  of  8,  provided  for  a  4-level increase  \"[i]f  the\n\ndefendant   previously  was   deported  after   sustaining  a\n\n                    \n\n1.  This statute provides in pertinent part as follows:\n\n     (a) [A]ny alien who--\n          (1) has been arrested and deported or excluded\n     and deported, and thereafter\n          (2) enters,  attempts to  enter, or is  at any\n     time found in, the United States ...

U.S.S.G.    2L1.2  &amp;\n\ncomment. (n.3) (Nov. 1990).  The revised version provides for\n\na  mandatory 16-level  enhancement  in  all  such  aggravated\n\nfelony  cases.   U.S.S.G.    2L1.2(b)(2)  (Nov.  1991).   The\n\namendment thus \"converted the discretionary choice whether to\n\nincrease   the   penalty  for   [aggravated   felons]   to  a\n\nrequirement, by instructing the court to add 16 points to the\n\ncalculation of their total offense level.\"   United States v.\n                                                          \n\nRodriguez, 26 F.3d 4, 7 (1st Cir. 1994).\n         \n\n     Defendant's argument  for a downward departure hinges on\n\nhis factual assertion that he reentered the country in August\n\n1991, before this amendment took effect.  While not disputing\n\nthe  amendment's applicability  per  se, he  argues that  the\n\n\"real crime\" sought to be proscribed by   1326 is  the act of\n\nreentry.    Sent. Tr.  at 7.   In  his  view, because  he had\n\nalready returned  to this country  by the time  the amendment\n\ntook effect, applying the  full 16-level enhancement to him--\n\n\"without  advance  warning  and  without  an  opportunity  to\n\nconform his conduct accordingly,\"  Brief at 5--would serve no\n\ndeterrent value.   He concludes that,  inasmuch as deterrence\n\nwas one of the purposes underlying the 1991 amendment, see 18\n                                                          \n\nU.S.C.    3553(a)(2)(B), this circumstance is  one that would\n\njustify a downward departure.   The district court disagreed,\n\n                             -3-\n\nholding that  it lacked the  authority to do  so.   We review\n\nthis  determination de  novo.   See,  e.g., United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nRivera, 994 F.2d 942, 951 (1st Cir. 1993).\n      \n\n                             II.\n\n     Even accepting defendant's premise regarding the date of\n\nreentry  (a  matter  hardly  free  of  doubt),2  we find  his\n\nargument  unpersuasive for  three  reasons.   First, it  runs\n\ncontrary to our recent decision in United States v. Smith, 14\n                                                         \n\nF.3d  662 (1st  Cir. 1994).   The  INS there  had erroneously\n\nadvised Smith at  the time  of deportation  that the  maximum\n\npenalty  for unlawful  return was  two years  of imprisonment\n\n                    \n\n2.  While  defendant told  the probation  office that  he had\nreentered  the  country  in   August  1991,  he  had  earlier\nsubmitted a sworn statement  to INS officials indicating that\nhe had returned in  February 1992.  At sentencing,  defendant\ninsisted  this   latter  statement   was  the  result   of  a\nmisunderstanding (apparently due to his lack of facility with\nthe English  language),  and  requested  the  opportunity  to\nestablish,  through the  testimony of  himself and  his wife,\nthat  the  August 1991  date was  the  correct one.   Without\naddressing  this  request,  the  court  announced a  contrary\nfinding.  After first indicating that it lacked the authority\nto depart downward, it stated:\n\n          I  am not  moreover persuaded  that he  did in\n     fact arrive in August  of '91.  He did  tell I.N.S.\n     he arrived in February [1992], and given that fact,\n     I will not depart.\n\nSent. Tr. at 28.   Yet when defendant thereafter  renewed his\nrequest to present evidence  supporting the August 1991 date,\nid. at 32,  the court  mentioned only its  perceived lack  of\n   \ndiscretion to undertake a departure, id. at 35.\n                                        \n     To the extent the court intended to rest its decision in\nthe  alternative  on  this  factual  finding,  of  course,  a\nseparate basis for affirmance would exist.  Given the modicum\nof ambiguity in  the record, however, we think  it preferable\nto address defendant's legal argument on the merits.    \n\n                             -4-\n\n(rather than fifteen years).   Smith argued that,  because he\n\nhad  relied  on this  notice in  deciding  to return,  he was\n\nentitled to a downward  departure.  We agreed with  the lower\n\ncourt that this was  not the kind of circumstance  that would\n\njustify such a  departure.  A contrary  conclusion would have\n\n\"countenance[d]  Smith's  purposeful  decision to  engage  in\n\nfelonious conduct,\" in derogation  of the goals of deterrence\n\nand promoting respect for the law.  Id. at 666; accord United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Ullyses-Salazar,      F.3d    , 1994 WL 267956,  at\n                         \n\n*3 to *4  (9th Cir. June  20, 1994).   So here, defendant  is\n\nseeking \"the benefit of a downward departure [simply] because\n\n[he] understood  the penalty he  would face to  be relatively\n\nminor.\"  Smith, 14 F.3d at 666. \n              \n\n     As a  related matter, defendant overlooks  the fact that\n\nthe former version of   2L1.2 encouraged upward departures in\n\ncases  of  aggravated  felons.    Even  under  that  version,\n\ntherefore, defendant could have  received a sentence at least\n\napproximating  the one  imposed here.   See United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nCampbell, 967 F.2d 20,  27 (2d Cir. 1992) (relying in part on\n        \n\nthe  subsequently enacted  16-level enhancement  in order  to\n\nfind  size of  such  an upward  departure  reasonable).   Cf.\n                                                             \n\nUnited States v.  Aymelek, 926  F.2d 64, 71  (1st Cir.  1991)\n                         \n\n(upholding upward  departure imposed  to take account  of the\n\n\"lag  time\" between  the increased  statutory penalties  in  \n\n1326 and \"the corresponding update of the guidelines\").\n\n                             -5-\n\n     Most important, defendant's focus  on the act of reentry\n\nis  misplaced.   As we  have  recently explained,  a deported\n\nalien  may commit an offense  under   1326  on three separate\n\noccasions:  when  he or  she  (1) \"enters\"  the  country, (2)\n\n\"attempts to enter\" the country, or (3) \"is at any time found\n\nin\" the country.  See Rodriguez, 26  F.3d at 8; United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Troncoso, 23  F.3d 612,  615 (1st Cir.  1994).   Defendant\n           \n\nhere was indicted for, and pled guilty to, the crime of being\n\n\"found  in\" the  country following  deportation.  This  is as\n\nmuch  a \"real crime\" (to use defendant's parlance) as are the\n\nacts  of entry  or  attempted entry.3    Indeed,    2L1.2  is\n\nentitled  \"Unlawfully  Entering  or Remaining  in  the United\n                                                 \n\nStates.\"  (Emphasis added).  Cf. United States v.  Whittaker,\n                                                            \n\n999  F.2d  38,  42-43  (2d  Cir.  1993)  (   1326  adequately\n\n\"informed [defendant]  that, if  he remained in  this country\n\nfollowing  his  illegal  reentry,  he  would  be  subject  to\n\ncriminal  prosecution when he  was 'found' here\").   Once the\n\namendment took  effect, defendant  had  the opportunity,  and\n\n                    \n\n3.  For this  reason, we  held in Rodriguez  that applying   \n                                           \n2L1.2's 16-level  enhancement to  an alien who  had reentered\nthe  country prior  to  November 1991  but  had been  \"found\"\nthereafter entailed no ex  post facto violation.  26  F.3d at\n                                     \n7-8; accord,  e.g., United States v.

On the\n                           \nsame rationale, we  held in  Troncoso that no  ex post  facto\n                                                             \ndifficulties arose from applying the increased penalties in  \n1326(b)(2)  to one who had reentered prior to their enactment\nbut been found thereafter.  23 F.3d at 615. \n\n                             -6-\n\nshould  have  had an  increased  incentive,  to \"conform  his\n\nconduct accordingly\" by departing from the country.  \n\n     For these  reasons, we agree  with the lower  court that\n\nthe circumstances here are not of a kind that would warrant a\n\ndownward departure.

U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2 &amp; comment.  (n.3) (Nov. 1990).  The revised version provides for a mandatory 16-level enhancement in all such aggravated felony cases.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2(b)(2) (Nov. 1991).

He thereafter returned to the United States without permission.  Upon being apprehended in July 1992, he was indicted on a single count of violating 8 U.S.C. Secs. 1326(a) and (b)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  He subsequently pled guilty to this charge and received a prison term of 46 months.  Defendant now advances a single challenge to his sentence, arguing that the district court mistakenly concluded it lacked the authority to depart downward in one particular respect.  We find no error and therefore affirm.  See Loc.  R. 27.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue is a November 1, 1991 revision to Sec. 2L1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which governs the offense here.  In its earlier form, this section prescribed a base offense level of 8, provided for a 4-level increase \"[i]f the defendant previously was deported after sustaining a conviction for a felony,\" and stated that \"an upward departure may be warranted\" where the earlier conviction had consisted of an aggravated felony.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2 &amp; comment.  (n.3) (Nov. 1990).  The revised version provides for a mandatory 16-level enhancement in all such aggravated felony cases.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2(b)(2) (Nov. 1991).  The amendment thus \"converted the discretionary choice whether to increase the penalty for [aggravated felons] to a requirement, by instructing the court to add 16 points to the calculation of their total offense level.\"   United States v. Rodriguez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195433\"><a href=\"/opinion/195433/united-states-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's argument for a downward departure hinges on his factual assertion that he reentered the country in August 1991, before this amendment took effect.  While not disputing the amendment's applicability per se, he argues that the \"real crime\" sought to be proscribed by Sec. 1326 is the act of reentry.  Sent. Tr. at 7. In his view, because he had already returned to this country by the time the amendment took effect, applying the full 16-level enhancement to him-\"without advance warning and without an opportunity to conform his conduct accordingly,\" Brief at 5-would serve no deterrent value.  He concludes that, inasmuch as deterrence was one of the purposes underlying the 1991 amendment, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(a)(2)(B), this circumstance is one that would justify a downward departure.  The district court disagreed, holding that it lacked the authority to do so.  We review this determination  de novo.  See, e.g., United States v. Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span>, 951 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even accepting defendant's premise regarding the date of reentry (a matter hardly free of doubt),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> we find his argument unpersuasive for three reasons.  First, it runs contrary to our recent decision in  United States v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195168\"><a href=\"/opinion/195168/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1994).  The INS there had erroneously advised Smith at the time of deportation that the maximum penalty for unlawful return was two years of imprisonment (rather than fifteen years).  Smith argued that, because he had relied on this notice in deciding to return, he was entitled to a downward departure.  We agreed with the lower court that this was not the kind of circumstance that would justify such a departure.  A contrary conclusion would have \"countenance[d] Smith's purposeful decision to engage in felonious conduct,\" in derogation of the goals of deterrence and promoting respect for the law.   <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195168\"><a href=\"/opinion/195168/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 666; </a></span> accord United States v.
