Howard, Attorney General, was on brief, for appellees.\r                           \r\n\n                                             \r\n\n                                             \r\r\n\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.  Petitioner-appellant Paul Little\r                    SELYA, Circuit Judge.\r                                        \r\n\nasked  the federal  district court  to invoke  its habeas  corpus\r\n\npowers, 28 U.S.C.     2241-2254 (1988), and set aside  a sentence\r\n\nimposed in a New Hampshire state court.\r\n\n          The  historical  facts  are  largely  undisputed.   The\r\n\nparties entered into  an agreement  for a \"naked  plea,\" i.e.,  a\r                                                                       \r\n\nguilty  plea  that  would  merit  a  mutually  agreed  sentencing\r\n\nrecommendation by  the prosecutor without purporting  to bind the\r\n\nsentencing  court  to  accept  the  recommendation.    The  state\r\n\ninitially  failed  to  make  the agreed  recommendation  and  the\r\n\nsuperior court levied a more severe sentence.  On appeal, the New\r\n\nHampshire  Supreme Court  vacated the  sentence.   Petitioner was\r\n\nresentenced before a  different judge, and  a prosecutor who  was\r\n\nnew  to the  case  represented the  state  at resentencing.    In\r\n\npetitioner's  view, she  gave  mere lip  service  to the  state's\r\n\npromise and thereby  deprived petitioner    who again received  a\r\n\nstiffer sentence  than the state  had agreed to suggest    of due\r\n\nprocess.    When petitioner  appealed,  the  state supreme  court\r\n\nrefused to set the sentence aside.  This habeas corpus proceeding\r\n\nfollowed.  The gravamen  of Little's petition is his  charge that\r\n\nthe  state, having  agreed  to recommend  a specific  sentence in\r\n\nexchange for petitioner's guilty  plea, effectively subverted the\r\n\nbargain.\r\n\n          We share  petitioner's major premise:   the Due Process\r\n\nClause  proscribes  not  only   the  explicit  repudiation  of  a\r\n\nprosecutor's assurances  to the defendant, but  also forbids end-\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nruns  around those  assurances.    See,  e.g., United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nCanada,  960 F.2d 263, 269-70  (1st Cir. 1992);  United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nBrown, 500 F.2d  375, 377-78  (4th Cir. 1974);  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nVoccola, 600  F. Supp.  1534, 1537  (D.R.I. 1985); see  generally\r                                                                           \r\n\nSantobello v. New  York, 404 U.S. 257, 262 (1971).   We disagree,\r                                 \r\n\nhowever, with  petitioner's conclusion  that  the state  violated\r\n\nthis tenet on resentencing.\r\n\n          We will not tarry.  The district court, in a thoughtful\r\n\nrescript,  declined to issue the writ.  See Little v. Cunningham,\r                                                                          \r\n\nNo.  C-94-523-L (D.N.H.  Dec.  29,  1994).   We  have  previously\r\n\nstated, and today reaffirm, that when a district judge produces a\r\n\nwell-reasoned  opinion   that  reaches  the   correct  result,  a\r\n\nreviewing tribunal should not  rush to write at length  merely to\r\n\nput  matters in its own words.   See, e.g., In re San Juan Dupont\r                                                                           \r\n\nPlaza  Hotel Fire Litig., 989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1993).  So it\r                                  \r\n\nis here.  Consequently, we affirm  the district court's dismissal\r\n\nof petitioner's habeas application for  substantially the reasons\r\n\nset forth in that court's rescript.\r\n\n          We add  only a decurate comment.   The jurisprudence of\r\n\nhabeas  corpus  demands that  a  federal  court cede  substantial\r\n\ndeference  to the state courts' subsidiary findings of fact.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\n28 U.S.C.   2254(d)  (stipulating presumption of correctness that\r\n\nattaches  to  state  court  findings of  fact  in  federal habeas\r\n\nproceedings);  see also  Miller v.  Fenton, 474 U.S.  104, 112-15\r                                                    \r\n\n(1985).   The  issue that  petitioner raises  here    whether the\r\n\nsecond  prosecutor, although mouthing  the agreed recommendation,\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nsimultaneously subverted it    is peculiarly fact-sensitive.  The\r\n\nrecord,   interpreted  one   way,   is   capable  of   supporting\r\n\npetitioner's view.   But interpreted  another way, the  record is\r\n\nequally  capable of supporting the  state courts' findings.  Both\r\n\ninterpretations  are  reasonable.    Neither   interpretation  is\r\n\ncompelled.  That ends the matter:   where, as here, the record in\r\n\na  habeas  case  supports  plausible  but  conflicting  factbound\r\n\ninferences, we think  that the state courts' choice  between them\r\n\nis  entitled to  the presumption  of correctness.   See  Neron v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nTierney,  841  F.2d  1197,  1200  (1st  Cir.)

The jurisprudence of habeas corpus demands that a federal court cede substantial deference to the state courts' subsidiary findings of fact.  See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2254(d) (stipulating presumption of correctness that attaches to state court findings of fact in federal habeas proceedings);  see also Miller v. Fenton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111542\"><a href=\"/opinion/111542/miller-v-fenton/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 112-15 (1985).  The issue that petitioner raises here whether the second prosecutor, although mouthing the agreed recommendation, simultaneously subverted it is peculiarly fact-sensitive.  The record, interpreted one way, is capable of supporting petitioner's view.  But interpreted another way, the record is equally capable of supporting the state courts' findings.  Both interpretations are reasonable.  Neither interpretation is compelled.  That ends the matter:  where, as here, the record in a habeas case supports plausible but conflicting factbound inferences, we think that the state courts' choice between them is entitled to the presumption of correctness.  See Neron v. Tierney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503069\"><a href=\"/opinion/503069/louis-neron-v-james-e-tierney-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1197</span></a></span>, 1200 (1st Cir.)  (holding that the presumption of correctness \"attaches in full flower\" where a state court's factual determinations are \" 'fairly supported by the record' \") (quoting 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2254(d)(8)), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">832</span> </span>(1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.
