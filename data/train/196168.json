D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                               \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Cyr, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                       Circuit Judges.\r                                                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\nRobert M.

DuBose,\r                                                                             \r\nAssistant United  States Attorney,  on Motion For  Summary Disposition\r\nfor appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          Per  Curiam.       Defendant  Robyn  Anderson   was\r                                 \r\n\nconvicted  of wire fraud,  bank fraud and  credit card fraud.\r\n\nShe appeals  only from one aspect  of her sentence --  a two-\r\n\nlevel  enhancement,  pursuant   to  U.S.S.G.      3C1.1,  for\r\n\nobstruction  of justice.   In  so doing,  defendant does  not\r\n\nchallenge  the   district  court's  determination   that  she\r\n\ncommitted perjury in  testifying at the  trial.  Rather,  she\r\n\nargues that the  district court made insufficiently  specific\r\n\nfactual findings as to  each element of a perjury  violation.\r\n\nThus,  she  concludes, the  matter  must be  remanded  so the\r\n\ndistrict court may make the requisite findings.\r\n\n          Once a district court determines that a defendant's\r\n\ntestimony constitutes  perjury,   3C1.1 mandates  a two-level\r\n\nenhancement in  that defendant's base offense  level.  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.  Austin, 948  F.2d  783, 788  (1st Cir.  1991).   A\r                             \r\n\nwitness  who testifies  under  oath commits  perjury \"if  she\r\n\ngives false  testimony concerning a material  matter with the\r\n\nwillful intent to provide  false testimony, rather than as  a\r\n\nresult  of  confusion, mistake  or faulty  memory.\"    United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Dunnigan, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116 (1993).  In deciding\r                              \r\n\nwhether  a defendant's BOL should be enhanced on the basis of\r\n\nperjury, the district court must  make \"independent findings\"\r\n\nthat \"encompass[] all of the factual predicates for a finding\r\n\nof perjury.\"   Id. at 1117.  \"A sentencing court, however, is\r                             \r\n\nnot required to address each element of perjury in a separate\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nand  clear finding.\"  United States  v. Matiz, 14 F.3d 79, 84\r                                                         \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          Here,  the district  court  judge stated  that  the\r\n\n\"testimony the defendant gave was clearly false, was false in\r\n\nmaterial ways to the issue  of guilt or innocence, and .  . .\r\n\nwas  willful.\"   He  stated also  that  \"all of  the  factual\r\n\npredicates for a finding  of perjury have  been met.\"  It  is\r\n\ndifficult to distinguish this  language from the language the\r\n\nCourt approved  in Dunnigan.   In determining  that defendant\r                                       \r\n\nhad committed  perjury, the Dunnigan  sentencing court stated\r                                                \r\n\nonly  that the defendant  had been \"untruthful  at trial with\r\n\nrespect  to material  matters\" and  that the  statements were\r\n\n\"designed to  substantially affect the outcome  of the case.\"\r\n\nDunnigan,  113 S.Ct.  at  1114-15  (internal quotation  marks\r                    \r\n\nomitted).\r\n\n          Defendant  argues  that   the  Court  in   Dunnigan\r                                                                         \r\n\nintended to limit its endorsement of such conclusory language\r\n\nto  the facts  of  that case.    Thus, she  posits,  Dunnigan\r                                                                         \r\n\nrequires  sentencing  courts,  in   future  cases,  to   make\r\n\n\"separate  and  clear\" findings.    There  is  no support  in\r\n\nDunnigan or  elsewhere for  this interpretation.   Indeed, in\r                                                                     \r\n\nMatiz, we relied on Dunnigan to reject a challenge to equally\r                                        \r\n\nterse phrasing.  Matiz,  14 F.3d at 84 (the  sentencing court\r                                  \r\n\nstated that  it \"did not credit\"  defendant's testimony, that\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ndefendant \"knowingly  told a false story\"  and that defendant\r\n\n\"did commit perjury\").\r\n\n     The  judgment   of  the  district   court  is  summarily\r\n\naffirmed.
