D/B/A AMERICAN EAGLE,\r\n   AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC., AND ICALM GROUP, INC.,\r\n\n                Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n     APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n          FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n     [Hon. Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                        Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n            Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n              and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nMarian H. Glaser for appellant.\r\nDennis J. Kelly with whom Mark J. Ventola and Christopher D.\r\nEngebretson were on brief for appellees.\r\n\nFebruary 5, 1999\r\n\nCOFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.  After sustaining injuries\r\nwhile descending stairs from an airplane, Martha Moise Louis\r\n(\"Louis\") filed suit against the airline and its insurance\r\nadjuster, ICALM.  The court: 1) dismissed the claim against ICALM\r\nfor lack of personal jurisdiction; 2) denied Louis's motion to\r\namend the complaint; and 3) denied her motion for post-judgment\r\ndiscovery regarding the identity of other possible defendants. \r\nLouis now appeals all three decisions.  Because the court's rulings\r\nwere entirely appropriate, we affirm.\r\n                     I. Background\r\nIn the first leg of a journey to Haiti, Louis boarded an\r\nAmerican Eagle (\"American\") commuter flight at Boston's Logan\r\nairport on January 6, 1994.  The flight was subsequently canceled,\r\nand the passengers were asked to deplane.  When descending the\r\nstairs to the tarmac, Louis slipped and fell on an icy patch.  She\r\ndeclined American's offer to arrange and pay for immediate medical\r\nassistance.  More than a year and a half later, in August 1995, her\r\nattorney sent a letter to American seeking a report of the\r\nincident.  American responded in October 1995 that it was\r\ncommencing an investigation of the accident and requested\r\ninformation about Louis's injuries.  Her counsel sent the material\r\non November 5, 1995.\r\nAmerican forwarded the package to its insurance adjuster,\r\nICALM, a New York corporation with its principal place of business\r\nin North Carolina.  On November 20, 1995, ICALM sent Louis a letter\r\nrequesting that she provide the medical and employment\r\nauthorizations necessary to verify the nature and extent of her\r\ninjuries.  Louis provided the materials on January 29, 1996, two\r\nyears and twenty-three days after the accident.  After conducting\r\nits own investigation, ICALM denied her claim because the Warsaw\r\nConvention's two-year statute of limitations had expired.  During\r\nthe entire period, ICALM contacted Louis or her attorney four\r\ntimes: once to request the authorizations, twice to return calls\r\nfrom Louis's attorney, and once to inform Louis that her claim had\r\nbeen denied.\r\nLouis subsequently filed suit in Massachusetts against\r\nAmerican for negligence and against ICALM for unfair or deceptive\r\ninsurance practices.  When both American and ICALM moved for\r\nsummary judgment, the court dismissed the claim against American as\r\nbarred by the statute of limitations.  It also expressed doubt\r\nabout its ability to exercise personal jurisdiction over ICALM, and\r\nasked Louis to file a supplemental memorandum detailing ICALM's\r\nrelevant in-state activities.  Louis filed both the supplemental\r\nmemorandum and a motion to amend the complaint to add \"Underwriters\r\nof Lloyd's of London\" as a defendant.  The court denied her motion\r\nto amend, and dismissed the claims against ICALM for lack of\r\npersonal jurisdiction.  Louis then filed a post-judgment discovery\r\nmotion in an attempt the learn the names of other defendants who\r\nmight not be covered by the same statute of limitations as\r\nAmerican, but again the court denied her entreaty.\r\n                     II. Discussion\r\nThe district court's opinions are lengthy and thoughtful,\r\nand we need not linger in our discussion of the issues.\r\nA. Personal Jurisdiction\r\nDistrict courts may exercise personal jurisdiction over\r\nout-of-state defendants if \"such jurisdiction is authorized by\r\nstate statute or rule and its exercise does not offend due\r\nprocess.\" United Elec. Workers v. 163 Pleasant Street Corp., 960\r\nF.2d 1080, 1086 (1st Cir. 1992).  In relevant part the\r\nMassachusetts long-arm statute provides for personal jurisdiction\r\nover a defendant in another state if he:\r\n(a) transact[s] any business in [Massachusetts];\r\n. . .\r\n(c) caus[es] tortious injury by an act or omission in\r\n[Massachusetts]; [or]\r\n(d) caus[es] tortious injury in [Massachusetts] by an act\r\nor omission outside [Massachusetts] if he regularly does\r\nor solicits business, or engages in any other persistent\r\ncourse of conduct, or derives substantial revenue from\r\ngoods used or consumed or services rendered, in\r\n[Massachusetts]; \r\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 223A,  3.  \r\nIn its opinion, the district court correctly found that\r\nnone of these standards had been met.  Subsection (a) requires the\r\ndefendant to have transacted business in Massachusetts.  ICALM, a\r\nNew York corporation with its principal place of business in North\r\nCarolina, marketed its services to American, a Delaware corporation\r\nwith principal places of business in Texas and Tennessee.  ICALM\r\nhas never maintained any presence in Massachusetts, nor is it\r\nregistered to do business there.  Its only contacts with\r\nMassachusetts arise from adjusting claims made by Massachusetts\r\nresidents against its clients located elsewhere.  \r\nMost cases exploring the reach of the \"transacting\r\nbusiness\" language involve direct contractual relations between the\r\nparties.  See, e.g., Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., 625 N.E.2d 549, 553\r\n(Mass. 1994).  In non-contractual cases such as this one\r\nMassachusetts has required more than the four contacts that\r\noccurred here for its courts to exercise jurisdiction.  See New\r\nHampshire Ins. Guar. Ass'n v. Markem Corp., 676 N.E.2d 809, 812\r\n(Mass. 1997) (finding in action by third party that foreign insured\r\nhad not transacted business in Massachusetts simply because foreign\r\ninsurer had conducted some administration of insured's policies in\r\nMassachusetts).  Even the most liberal interpretation of ICALM's\r\nin-state activities would not permit personal jurisdiction under\r\nthis prong of the statute.\r\nSubsection (c) is equally inapplicable since it requires\r\nthe tortious act to be within Massachusetts.  The complaint alleged\r\nthat ICALM delayed its investigation and failed to affirm or deny\r\ncoverage within a reasonable time.  ICALM's actions and alleged\r\nomissions, consisting solely of examining the related documents and\r\ndenying coverage, took place entirely at its offices in North\r\nCarolina.\r\nSubsection (d) does allow a plaintiff to file suit for\r\ninjuries in Massachusetts based on tortious acts or omissions\r\noutside the state.  However, Louis's complaint cannot meet the\r\nother element of that subsection, which requires a finding that\r\nICALM \"regularly does or solicits business, or engages in any other\r\npersistent course of conduct, or derives substantial revenue from\r\n. . . services rendered, in [Massachusetts].\"  As stated earlier,\r\nICALM does not do business in Massachusetts, or solicit business\r\nthere.  Nor does it derive substantial revenue from services\r\nrendered there.  A finding that ICALM's two letters and two phone\r\ncalls constituted a \"persistent course of conduct\" would stretch\r\nthat term beyond all recognition.\r\nThe long arm statute simply does not allow courts in\r\nMassachusetts to exercise jurisdiction over ICALM under the facts\r\nof this case, as the district court correctly ruled.\r\nB.  Motion to amend\r\nAfter the court permitted Louis to fortify her filing\r\nwith respect to ICALM's in-state activities, Louis filed a\r\nsupplemental memorandum and a motion to amend the complaint to add\r\n\"Underwriters of Lloyd's of London\" as a defendant.  Noting both\r\nthat it was an attempt to delay the inevitable dismissal of the\r\naction against the current defendants and that Louis had learned\r\nabout the insurance company's identity four months earlier, the\r\ncourt denied her motion.  We review such a decision under an abuse\r\nof discretion standard, and \"defer to the district court if any\r\nadequate reason for the denial is apparent on the record.\"  Grantv. News Group Boston, Inc., 55 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\nIt is evident that the court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion.  A finding that Louis unduly delayed filing the motion\r\nis an adequate reason to deny it.  See Acosta-Mestre v. Hilton\r\nInt'l of Puerto Rico, Inc., 156 F.3d 49, 51 (1st Cir. 1998).  The\r\naction began on December 31, 1996.  On October 1, 1997, Louis\r\nlearned that Lloyd's was the insurer.  However, she neglected to\r\nmove to amend until February 19, 1998, fourteen months after the\r\noriginal complaint was filed and more than four months after she\r\ndiscovered the insurer's identity.  The district court found that\r\nthis four month wait constituted undue delay, especially in light\r\nof the court's intervening ruling that the claim against American\r\nwas dismissed and the claims against ICALM would likely be as well. \r\nThe district court's reason for denying her motion is sufficient.\r\nC. Post-Judgment Discovery\r\nLouis subsequently filed a motion asking the court to\r\nstay judgment, to reconsider and to permit discovery of other\r\npossible defendants.  It was denied.  The district court has\r\nconsiderable discretion in ruling on discovery motions and will be\r\noverruled only if it abused that discretion.  Daigle v. Maine Med.\r\nCtr., Inc., 14 F.3d 684, 692 (1st Cir. 1994); see also  Mack v.\r\nGreat Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co., Inc., 871 F.2d 179, 186 (1st\r\nCir. 1989) (requiring the ruling to be \"plainly wrong and result[]\r\nin substantial prejudice\").\r\nSince the district court succinctly and aptly disposed of\r\nthis issue, we quote its language here at length:\r\n     Essentially, plaintiff asks the court\r\nto stay the case until defendants, after the\r\ncourt has ruled that plaintiff does not have\r\nany legally cognizable claims against them,\r\ntell plaintiff who was the owner of the\r\nstaircase on which plaintiff fell. \r\n\n     Plaintiff's request for discovery after\r\na final judgment in this civil action, without\r\neven a contention that the requested discovery\r\nwould be material to the outcome of this civil\r\naction, is simply unprecedented and has no\r\nsupport at law.\r\n\nBecause all three decisions challenged on appeal were\r\nentirely appropriate, the decision is affirmed.\n",
