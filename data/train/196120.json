The 1992 version of   2119 provides:\r\n\n               Whoever, possessing a firearm, . . .\r\n          takes  a  motor  vehicle  that  has  been\r\n          transported,  shipped,   or  received  in\r\n          interstate or foreign  commerce from  the\r\n          person  or presence  of another  by force\r\n          and  violence  or  by   intimidation,  or\r\n          attempts to do so, shall--\r\n               (1)  be  fined under  this  title or\r\n          imprisoned  not more  than  15 years,  or\r\n          both.\r\n\n2.  Section 924(c) provides:\r\n\n          Whoever--\r\n               (1) uses  a  firearm to  commit  any\r\n          felony for which he  may be prosecuted in\r\n          a court of the United States, or\r\n               (2)  carries  a  firearm  unlawfully\r\n          during the commission  of any felony  for\r\n          which he may be  prosecuted in a court of\r\n          the United States, shall, in  addition to\r\n          the    punishment   provided    for   the\r\n          commission of such  felony, be  sentenced\r\n          to a  term of imprisonment  for not  less\r\n          than one year nor more than ten years.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nPuerto  Rico.    The  gunmen  tied  up  Rosado's  family  and\r\n\nthreatened  to kill them if Rosado did not meet their demands\r\n\nfor money and jewelry.\r\n\n          In  response  to their  threat,  Rosado offered  to\r\n\nbring the gunmen to her parents' farm in Barranquitas where a\r\n\nfriend  had  allegedly  buried some  jewelry.    Perez-Garcia\r\n\ninstructed Rosado to give him her car keys.  Perez-Garcia and\r\n\none of his accomplices  then forced Rosado to ride  with them\r\n\nin her car to  Barranquitas to recover the jewelry  while the\r\n\nother gunmen  remained at Rosado's house,  holding her family\r\n\nhostage.\r\n\n          When they arrived at the farm, Perez-Garcia and his\r\n\naccomplice forced Rosado, her mother, brother, and sister-in-\r\n\nlaw,  all  of whom  were home  at the  time,  to dig  for the\r\n\njewelry.   After Rosado and  the others  unearthed six  five-\r\n\ngallon buckets  of  valuables,3 at  the  gunmen's  direction,\r\n\nthey loaded them into the trunk of  Rosado's car.  The gunmen\r\n\nthen  forced Rosado  and her  sister-in-law into the  car and\r\n\nordered Rosado to return to Bayamon.\r\n\n          Upon  reaching   Bayamon,  Perez-Garcia  instructed\r\n\nRosado to stop at a  public telephone.  Perez-Garcia remained\r\n\nin  the car  while his  accomplice ran  across the  street to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  The  buckets  did  not  contain  jewelry  as  Rosado  had\r\nthought,  but  instead  contained  U.S.  currency,  totalling\r\n$654,100.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nplace a call.   While Perez-Garcia waited for  his accomplice\r\n\nto return, three police officers approached Rosado's car with\r\n\ntheir  weapons drawn  and ordered  Perez-Garcia to  get out.4\r\n\nPerez-Garcia  instructed  Rosado to  drive  away.   When  she\r\n\nrefused, Perez-Garcia  pushed her  out of  the car  and drove\r\n\noff.  After a brief pursuit, Perez-Garcia was apprehended.\r\n\n          On November 3, 1993,  a federal grand jury returned\r\n\na   two-count   indictment,   charging    Perez-Garcia   with\r\n\ncarjacking, in violation of    2119 (\"Count I\"), and  using a\r\n\nfirearm in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of  \r\n\n924(c)  (\"Count II\").    Before trial,  Perez-Garcia filed  a\r\n\nmotion to dismiss Count II,  arguing that the Double Jeopardy\r\n\nClause  barred simultaneous  prosecution  under     2119  and\r\n\n924(c).   The district court  denied the motion  and the case\r\n\nproceeded to trial.\r\n\n          At the close of  evidence, Perez-Garcia moved for a\r\n\njudgment of  acquittal  pursuant to  Fed.  R. Crim.  P.  29,5\r\n\narguing that  there was  insufficient evidence to  prove that\r\n\nthe car was taken  \"from the person\" of Rosado, as charged in\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  The gunmen remaining  at Rosado's house  had fled, and  a\r\nmember Rosado's  family had called  the police to  report the\r\nincident and give them a description of Rosado's car. \r\n\n5.  Fed. R. Crim. P.  29 provides:  \"The  court on motion  of\r\nthe defendant  . .  . shall  order the  entry of  judgment of\r\nacquittal of one or  more offenses charged in  the indictment\r\nor information after the evidence on either side is closed if\r\nthe  evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such\r\noffense or offenses.\"\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nthe indictment.  The district court denied the motion and, on\r\n\nFebruary 9, 1994,Perez-Garcia was found guilty onboth counts.\r\n\n          At  the  sentencing   hearing,  Perez-Garcia   made\r\n\nanother  motion  to  dismiss  Count  II  on  double  jeopardy\r\n\ngrounds.  The district court  denied the motion and sentenced\r\n\nPerez-Garcia  to 175  months'  imprisonment for  Count I  and\r\n\nsixty  months'  imprisonment  for  Count  II.    This  appeal\r\n\nfollowed.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          On  appeal, Perez-Garcia  argues that  the evidence\r\n\nwas  insufficient  to  support  a conviction  under     2119,\r\n\nbecause he had not taken the car \"from the person\" of Rosado,\r\n\nas charged in the indictment.6\r\n\n          Count  I  of  the  indictment charged  that  Perez-\r\n\nGarcia:\r\n\n          aided and abetted by persons to the Grand\r\n          Jury unknown and while in possession of a\r\n          firearm .  . .  did take a  motor vehicle\r\n          from the person  of Maria de los  Angeles\r                                     \r\n          Rosado  Rosario,  by force,  violence and\r\n          intimidation  . .  .  said motor  vehicle\r\n          having   been  transported,   shipped  or\r\n          received   in   interstate   or   foreign\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Perez-Garcia also argues that  the Double Jeopardy Clause\r\nbars  cumulative  punishment   under      2119   and  924(c).\r\nHowever, the First Circuit recently  decided that \"cumulative\r\npunishment under 18 U.S.C.    2119 and 924(c) does not offend\r\nthe   Double   Jeopardy   clause   of   the   United   States\r\nConstitution.\"  United States v. Centeno-Torres, No. 94-1882,\r                                                           \r\nslip  op. at 4 (1st Cir. Mar. 28, 1995).  Accordingly, Perez-\r\nGarcia's double jeopardy claim fails.   \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          commerce.  All in violation of [18 U.S.C.\r\n            2119(1) and (2)].\r\n\n(emphasis   added).     Perez-Garcia,   in   challenging  his\r\n\nconviction, argues that the adduced facts belie the charge in\r\n\nthe indictment.   He contends  that although he  was charged,\r\n\nconvicted, and sentenced for taking a motor vehicle \"from the\r\n\nperson\"  of Rosado,  the evidence  presented at  trial proved\r\n\nthat  the motor  vehicle  was taken  \"from  the presence\"  of\r\n\nRosado.7  We reject his argument.\r\n\n          Although  Perez-Garcia  frames  his  argument  as a\r\n\nsufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge, in effect, he contends\r\n\nthat  there  was a  prejudicial  variance  between the  facts\r\n\nproved  at trial  and those  alleged in  the indictment.   \"A\r\n\nvariance occurs when the  charging terms remain unchanged but\r\n\nwhen  the  facts proved  at  trial are  different  from those\r\n\nalleged  in the indictment.\"  United States v. Fisher, 3 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n456, 462 (1st Cir.  1993); see also United States  v.

Perez-Garcia  contends that he  effectively took Rosado's\r\ncar when he obtained her  car keys, at which time  Rosado was\r\ninside her  house and  the car  was parked  on the street  in\r\nfront of  the house. Perez-Garcia  concedes that the  car was\r\ntaken from Rosado's observation or control -- i.e., \"from the\r\npresence\" of Rosado -- but argues that it was not taken \"from\r\nthe person\" of Rosado, as charged in the indictment.  Section\r\n2119 criminalizes takings \"from the person or presence.\"\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nagainst  him  in order  to prepare  an effective  defense and\r\n\navoid  surprise at trial, and to prevent a second prosecution\r\n\nfor the  same offense.'\"     Fisher, 3  F.3d at  463 (quoting\r                                               \r\n\nTormos-Vega, 959 F.2d at 1115). \r                       \r\n\n          The carjacking  statute does  not define \"from  the\r\n\nperson or presence,\" and neither do the robbery statutes upon\r\n\nwhich   2119  was based.  See H.R.  Rep.

Courts  generally agree that  taking from a\r\n\nvictim's  person  is understood  to  include  the common  law\r\n\nconception  of taking  from a victim's  presence.   See e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nCollins  v.

The gunmen tied up Rosado's family and threatened to kill them if Rosado did not meet their demands for money and jewelry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to their threat, Rosado offered to bring the gunmen to her parents' farm in Barranquitas where a friend had allegedly buried some jewelry.  Perez-Garcia instructed Rosado to give him her car keys.  Perez-Garcia and one of his accomplices then forced Rosado to ride with them in her car to Barranquitas to recover the jewelry while the other gunmen remained at Rosado's house, holding her family hostage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When they arrived at the farm, Perez-Garcia and his accomplice forced Rosado, her mother, brother, and sister-in-law, all of whom were home at the time, to dig for the jewelry.  After Rosado and the others unearthed six five-gallon buckets of valuables,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> at the gunmen's direction, they loaded them into the trunk of Rosado's car.  The gunmen then forced Rosado and her sister-in-law into the car and ordered Rosado to return to Bayamon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon reaching Bayamon, Perez-Garcia instructed Rosado to stop at a public telephone.  Perez-Garcia remained in the car while his accomplice ran across the street to place a call.  While Perez-Garcia waited for his accomplice to return, three police officers approached Rosado's car with their weapons drawn and ordered Perez-Garcia to get out.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Perez-Garcia instructed Rosado to drive away.  When she refused, Perez-Garcia pushed her out of the car and drove off.  After a brief pursuit, Perez-Garcia was apprehended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 3, 1993, a federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment, charging Perez-Garcia with carjacking, in violation of Sec. 2119 (\"Count I\"), and using a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of Sec. 924(c) (\"Count II\").  Before trial, Perez-Garcia filed a motion to dismiss Count II, arguing that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred simultaneous prosecution under Secs. 2119 and 924(c).  The district court denied the motion and the case proceeded to trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of evidence, Perez-Garcia moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> arguing that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the car was taken \"from the person\" of Rosado, as charged in the indictment.  The district court denied the motion and, on February 9, 1994, Perez-Garcia was found guilty on both counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, Perez-Garcia made another motion to dismiss Count II on double jeopardy grounds.  The district court denied the motion and sentenced Perez-Garcia to 175 months' imprisonment for Count I and sixty months' imprisonment for Count II.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Perez-Garcia argues that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction under Sec. 2119, because he had not taken the car \"from the person\" of Rosado, as charged in the indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count I of the indictment charged that Perez-Garcia:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>aided and abetted by persons to the Grand Jury unknown and while in possession of a firearm ... did take a motor vehicle from the person of Maria de los Angeles Rosado Rosario, by force, violence and intimidation ... said motor vehicle having been transported, shipped or received in interstate or foreign commerce.  All in violation of [18 U.S.C. Sec. 2119(1) and (2) ].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).  Perez-Garcia, in challenging his conviction, argues that the adduced facts belie the charge in the indictment.  He contends that although he was charged, convicted, and sentenced for taking a motor vehicle \"from the person\" of Rosado, the evidence presented at trial proved that the motor vehicle was taken \"from the presence\" of Rosado.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  We reject his argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Perez-Garcia frames his argument as a sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge, in effect, he contends that there was a prejudicial variance between the facts proved at trial and those alleged in the indictment.  \"A variance occurs when the charging terms remain unchanged but when the facts proved at trial are different from those alleged in the indictment.\"  United States v. Fisher, 3 F.3d 456, 462 (1st Cir.1993);  see also United States v. Tormos-Vega, 959 F.2d 1103, 1115 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 191, 192, 121 L.Ed.2d 135 (1992).  \"A variance is grounds for reversal only if it affected the defendant's 'substantial rights'--i.e., the rights to 'have sufficient knowledge of the charge against him in order to prepare an effective defense and avoid surprise at trial, and to prevent a second prosecution for the same offense.' \"  Fisher, 3 F.3d at 463 (quoting Tormos-Vega, 959 F.2d at 1115).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The carjacking statute does not define \"from the person or presence,\" and neither do the robbery statutes upon which Sec. 2119 was based.  See H.R.Rep. No. 102-851(I), 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 5 (1992), reprinted in 1992 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2829, 2834 (\"definition of [carjacking] tracks the language used in other federal robbery statutes\");  18 U.S.C. Secs. 2111, 2113, and 2118.  Courts generally agree that taking from a victim's person is understood to include the common law conception of taking from a victim's presence.  See e.g., Collins v. McDonald, 258 U.S. 416, 420, 42 S.Ct. 326, 328, 66 L.Ed. 692 (1922) (\"taking property from the presence of another feloniously and by putting him in fear is equivalent to taking it from his personal protection and is, in law, a taking from the person\");  Norris v.

Commonwealth, 18 Va.App. 706, 446 S.E.2d 628, 629 (1994).  Here, it is apparent that the vehicle was taken from the person of Rosado when the defendant forced her to ride with him in her car to the family farm.  Such a taking was, in law, a taking of the motor vehicle \"from the person\" of Rosado.  Thus, the facts proved at trial and those alleged in the indictment do not amount to a variance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment below is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The 1992 version of Sec. 2119 provides:</p>\n        <p>Whoever, possessing a firearm, ... takes a motor vehicle that has been transported, shipped, or received in interstate or foreign commerce from the person or presence of another by force and violence or by intimidation, or attempts to do so, shall--</p>\n        <p>(1) be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 15 years, or both.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Section 924(c) provides:</p>\n        <p>Whoever--</p>\n        <p>(1) uses a firearm to commit any felony for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, or</p>\n        <p>(2) carries a firearm unlawfully during the commission of any felony for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for the commission of such felony, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for not less than one year nor more than ten years.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The buckets did not contain jewelry as Rosado had thought, but instead contained U.S. currency, totalling $654,100</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The gunmen remaining at Rosado's house had fled, and a member of Rosado's family had called the police to report the incident and give them a description of Rosado's car</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 provides:  \"The court on motion of the defendant ... shall order the entry of judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses charged in the indictment or information after the evidence on either side is closed if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Perez-Garcia also argues that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars cumulative punishment under Secs. 2119 and 924(c).

Perez-Garcia, in challenging his conviction, argues that the adduced facts belie the charge in the indictment.  He contends that although he was charged, convicted, and sentenced for taking a motor vehicle \"from the person\" of Rosado, the evidence presented at trial proved that the motor vehicle was taken \"from the presence\" of Rosado.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  We reject his argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Perez-Garcia frames his argument as a sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge, in effect, he contends that there was a prejudicial variance between the facts proved at trial and those alleged in the indictment.  \"A variance occurs when the charging terms remain unchanged but when the facts proved at trial are different from those alleged in the indictment.\"  United States v.
