Laws  Ann. tit. 26,   1914.   It\r\n\nis our preferred  practice that when, as now, \"a  trial court has\r\n\nproduced a first-rate  work product, a reviewing  tribunal should\r\n\nhesitate  to wax  longiloquent  simply  to  hear  its  own  words\r\n\nresonate.\"   In re San Juan  Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire  Litig., 989\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1993).

This is both too\r                       \r\n\nlate and too little.\r\n\n          In the first  place, it is our settled  rule that legal\r\n\ntheories   not   developed   in  the   trial   court   cannot  be\r\n\nsplendiforously unveiled on  appeal.  See Teamsters,  Chauffeurs,\r                                                                           \r\n\nWarehousemen and Helpers Union, Local No. 59 v.

In  the second place, the\r             \r\n\nChevron  principle does not apply \"to agency litigating positions\r                 \r\n\nthat  are   wholly  unsupported   by  regulations,  rulings,   or\r\n\nadministrative practice.\"   Bowen v.
