At issue here  is whether the\r                    TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.\r                                          \r\n\nDefendants  were   properly  required  to  pay   the  Plaintiffs'\r\n\nattorneys'  fees.    Plaintiffs/appellees  are  Whitney  Brothers\r\n\nCompany  (\"Whitney  Brothers\") and  Griffin  M.  Stabler, Whitney\r\n\nBrothers'  president,  chief  executive  officer  and   director.\r\n\nDefendants/appellants, David C. Sprafkin and Joan Barenholtz, are\r\n\nthe   trustees  of  the  Bernard  M.  Barenholtz  Trust,  Whitney\r\n\nBrothers' majority shareholder.\r\n\n          In the underlying litigation, Plaintiffs sued to compel\r\n\nDefendants to sell their stock  in Whitney Brothers pursuant to a\r\n\nwritten buy/sell  contract.  After  two years of  litigation, the\r\n\ndistrict  court ordered the sale  at Defendants' asking price and\r\n\nheld  that the Plaintiffs  were entitled to  satisfy the purchase\r\n\nprice with a prepayable promissory note.  The district court also\r                                 \r\n\nconcluded  that  the  Defendants had  resisted  their obligations\r\n\nunder the buy/sell  agreement in bad faith, and  accordingly used\r\n\nits inherent  powers to  shift the  Plaintiffs' attorneys'  fees.\r\n\nThe  district court  predicated its bad  faith finding  on, inter\r                                                                           \r\n\nalia, the  Defendants'  continuous insistence  that the  purchase\r              \r\n\nprice was not prepayable.\r\n\n          On  appeal, we  reversed the district  court's judgment\r\n\nwith respect  to prepayment.   The Defendants  filed a  Motion to\r\n\nReconsider the  imposition of  attorneys' fees  in  light of  our\r\n\nreversal on  the prepayability of  the note.  The  district court\r\n\nheld that the  fee award was  still justified but  amended it  to\r\n\nexclude  fees earned  in connection  with  the prepayment  issue.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n Defendants now appeal.  For the following reasons, we vacate that\r\n\nportion of the court's order imposing fees and remand for further\r\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Whitney  Brothers is a  New Hampshire  corporation that\r\n\nproduces wooden learning materials.  Bernard Barenholtz  acquired\r\n\n62.6% of  the company's  outstanding shares in  1969.   Ten years\r\n\nlater, he transferred  these shares to the  Bernard M. Barenholtz\r\n\nTrust  (the  \"Trust\")  and  named  himself  and  defendant  David\r\n\nSprafkin trustees.  Plaintiff Griffin  Stabler owned 32.7% of the\r\n\nshares, and his son, David Stabler, owned the remaining 4.7%.\r\n\n          On  January 27, 1987,  Whitney Brothers,  the trustees,\r\n\nand Griffin Stabler  executed a written buy/sell  agreement (\"The\r\n\nAgreement\").  Under The Agreement, Whitney Brothers would buy the\r\n\nTrust's  shares  within  ninety  days  of the  death  of  Bernard\r\n\nBarenholtz and buy Griffin Stabler's shares within ninety days of\r\n\nStabler's death.   To determine  the purchase price,  the parties\r\n\nwould plug  an agreed-upon appraisal into a  formula to determine\r\n\nthe purchase  price.   If  the  parties  could not  agree  on  an\r\n\nappraisal, they  would each  get their own  and plug  the average\r\n\ninto the  formula.  The contract  also provided for payment  by a\r\n\npromissory note, with monthly installments over ten  years at 10%\r\n\ninterest  per  annum.   The  Agreement  did  not  mention whether\r\n\nprepayment of the note was permissible.\r\n\n          On   February  3,   1987,   Bernard  Barenholtz'   (and\r\n\nDefendants')  attorney Samuel M. Sprafkin wrote a letter advising\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n Mr.  Barenholtz that  the promissory  note  should be  prepayable\r\n\nwithout  penalty.   The  district court  found  that the  parties\r\n\norally agreed to  the letter's prepayment provision.   Barenholtz\r\n\nthen placed the letter in a file with the written contract.\r\n\n          When  Bernard Barenholtz died,  on August 5,  1989, his\r\n\ndaughter,  defendant   Joan  Barenholtz,   assumed  his   trustee\r\n\nposition.   A  few days  later,  plaintiff Stabler  and defendant\r\n\nSprafkin discussed  the contract's required  stock sale.   One of\r\n\nthe  parties asked  E.F. Greene  to  update a  past appraisal  of\r\n\nWhitney  Brothers.1     Sprafkin  rejected   Greene's  appraisal;\r\n\nWhitney Brothers  accepted it.   Relying  on Greene's  appraisal,\r\n\nWhitney  Brothers tendered to  Defendants a prepayable promissory\r\n\nnote for $1,178,000 for the stock.2\r\n\n          Instead of responding immediately, Defendants secured a\r\n\nsignificantly  higher appraisal  from  Alfred  Schimmel,  a  real\r\n\nestate appraiser from New York  City.  They then rejected Whitney\r\n\nBrothers'  tender  by  letter,   without  mentioning  the  note's\r\n\nprepayment  clause.     When  Stabler   learned  of   Defendants'\r\n\nappraisal, he rejected it as too high.\r\n\n          Ultimately, Plaintiffs  sued to compel  the transfer of\r\n\nthe stock.   Ten months later, on  December 13, 1990, as  part of\r\n\ntheir cross-motion  for summary  judgment, Plaintiffs offered  to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  The parties disagree over who requested the update.\r\n\n2  Defendants  contend that Stabler made the  tender knowing that\r\nthey did not accept Greene's  appraisal and planned to obtain one\r\nof their own.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n tender  either $1,349,3433  immediately or,  if  the court  found\r\n\nthat The  Agreement did not  permit prepayment, that  amount over\r\n\nten years at 10% interest.  Defendants again rejected the tender.\r\n\nThey now  contend that they  rejected it because: (1)  it omitted\r\n\n$145,000  worth of  interest that  had accrued since  November 3,\r\n\n1989, 90 days  after the death of Bernard  Barenholtz, and (2) it\r\n\nwas  invalid because the  first option permitted  prepayment, and\r\n\nthe  second option  was conditioned  upon a  court judgment  that\r\n\nprepayment  was   prohibited.    Plaintiffs  maintain   that  the\r\n\nDefendants   continually  and   in  bad   faith  resisted   their\r\n\nobligations under The Agreement so that they could sell the stock\r\n\nto one of Whitney Brothers' competitors at a higher price.\r\n\n          In response to the cross-motions for summary  judgment,\r\n\nthe district court: (1)  ordered Defendants to sell their  stock;\r\n\n(2) found that  Plaintiffs were not entitled to  prepay the note;\r\n\nand (3) decided  that a trial was  necessary on the issue  of the\r\n\nstock  price.   See Whitney  Bros. Co.  v. Sprafkin,  No. 90-54-S\r                                                             \r\n\n(D.N.H. filed June 5, 1991)(the \"Summary Judgment Opinion\").\r\n\n          After a  six-day trial,  the court  issued an  order in\r\n\nwhich it: (1)  required the Plaintiffs to pay  $1,349,343 for the\r\n\nstock;4 (2) reconsidered  and reversed, sua sponte,  its previous\r                                                            \r\n\norder  and ruled that  the parties' oral  agreement regarding the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3  This  was the price calculated under the  contract by plugging\r\nthe average of the two appraisals into the formula.\r\n\n4   The  court  held that  the  Plaintiffs were  bound  by  their\r\nsummary-judgment-motion stipulation  that  the  stock  price  was\r\n$1,349,343.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n prepayability of  the note was  binding and, therefore,  that the\r\n\nPlaintiffs  could pay for the stock  with a prepayable promissory\r\n\nnote; (3)  ruled that interest on the  note would begin to accrue\r\n\nwhen it was executed, and not  before; and (4) used its  inherent\r\n\npowers to  assess attorneys' fees against the Defendants based on\r\n\ntheir  bad faith  conduct throughout  the  litigation.5   Whitney\r                                                                           \r\n\nBros. Co. v. Sprafkin, No. 90-054-S, 1992 WL 686272 (D.N.H. Sept.\r                               \r\n\n30, 1992)(\"the Order\").  The  Order cited the Defendants' refusal\r\n\nto accept a prepayable note despite their oral agreement to do so\r\n\nas one of five instances of their bad faith.\r\n\n          On  appeal  (the  \"First  Appeal\"),   we,  inter  alia,\r                                                                          \r\n\nreversed  the district  court's  judgment  with  respect  to  the\r\n\nprepayability of the  note, holding that The  Agreement precluded\r\n\nthe  Plaintiffs'  efforts  to  prepay  regardless  of  whether  a\r\n\nsubsequent oral agreement provided for prepayment.  Whitney Bros.\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo. v. Sprafkin, 3 F.3d 530 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                         \r\n\n          Defendants  then filed a  motion asking that  the court\r\n\nreconsider the  imposition of  attorneys'  fees in  light of  our\r\n\nreversal on the prepayment issue.  The court denied the Motion to\r\n\nReconsider without a hearing,6 holding that the integrity  of the\r\n\ncourt's previous  bad  faith  finding was  not  damaged  by  this\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5   Although the  parties briefed the  issue, the  district court\r\nimposed the fee award without the benefit of a hearing. \r\n\n6  Judge Stahl, who presided over the trial and issued the Order,\r\nrequested that the  matter be assigned to another  judge after he\r\nwas  appointed to  the Court  of Appeals  for the  First Circuit.\r\nJudge   DiClerico  presided  over  the  remainder  of  the  case,\r\nincluding the Defendants' Motion for Reconsideration.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n Court's  reversal  on  the  prepayment issue.    The  court  did,\r\n\nhowever,  amend the  fee  award  to exclude  all  fees earned  in\r\n\nconnection with the prepayment issue.  Defendants now appeal.\r\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\n          We  review a district  court's imposition  of sanctions\r\n\nunder its inherent power for  an abuse of discretion, Chambers v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nNASCO, 501 U.S. 32, 55  (1991), giving recognition to the premise\r               \r\n\nthat the  \"district court  is better situated  than the  court of\r\n\nappeals  to marshal  the  pertinent  facts  and apply  the  fact-\r\n\ndependent  legal standard\" that  informs its determination  as to\r\n\nwhether  sanctions are  warranted.   Cooter  &amp;  Gell v.  Hartmarx\r                                                                           \r\n\nCorp., 496 U.S.  384, 402 (1990).  We  nonetheless remain mindful\r               \r\n\nthat a \"district court would necessarily abuse  its discretion if\r\n\nit  based its  ruling on  an erroneous  view of  the law or  on a\r\n\nclearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\"  Id. at 405.\r                                                             \r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n          The issue  before us  is whether  the district  court's\r\n\nimposition of attorneys' fees constitutes an abuse of discretion,\r\n\nparticularly in  light of our  reversal on the  prepayment issue.\r\n\nThe  Plaintiffs  allege  that  the  Defendants  raised  frivolous\r\n\ndefenses in bad faith solely to avoid their obligations under The\r\n\nAgreement  so that  they  could  sell the  securities  to one  of\r\n\nWhitney  Brothers' competitors at  a higher price.   Accordingly,\r\n\nthe Plaintiffs contend, the fee award  is appropriate despite our\r\n\nreversal on the  prepayment issue.  The Defendants  maintain that\r\n\nthey resisted the Plaintiffs' attempts to implement The Agreement\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n in good  faith because, inter  alia, (1) the  Plaintiffs insisted\r                                             \r\n\nthat  the note  was  prepayable, and  (2) they  were legitimately\r\n\nconcerned that the  Plaintiffs were both financially  and legally\r\n\nincapable of fulfilling  their obligations  under The  Agreement.\r\n\nThe   Defendants  further  maintain  that  our  reversal  on  the\r\n\nprepayment issue completely  justifies their position  throughout\r\n\nthe course  of  the  litigation,  and  that  the  district  court\r\n\ntherefore  abused  its  discretion in  assessing  attorneys' fees\r\n\nagainst them.  \r\n\n          With regard to  the original finding of  bad faith, the\r\n\ndistrict court stated the following:\r\n\n            A retrospective  look at  this litigation\r\n            reveals   Defendants'   bad    faith   in\r\n            resisting  their  obligation  to  perform\r\n            under The  Agreement.  In support  of its\r\n            bad  faith ruling,  the  Court makes  the\r\n            following observations and findings:\r\n\n               1.   In   initially   resisting  their\r\n            obligation    under     The    Agreement,\r\n            Defendants  relied  primarily   upon  the\r\n            argument   that   Plaintiffs   were   not\r\n            financially able  to  perform.   However,\r\n            Defendants  advanced  no  expert  opinion\r\n            either  to  support   their  claim  or to\r\n            counter the opinion of Plaintiffs' expert\r\n            that Plaintiffs   were  indeed ready  and\r\n            able to perform.  Moreover, The Agreement\r\n            itself  certainly   did  not   explicitly\r\n            contemplate the  sort of  financial \"veto\r\n            power\"  Defendants attempted to assert in\r\n            the   earlier   stages  of   this   case.\r\n            Finally, an  examination of the financial\r\n            data   advanced   by   Plaintiffs'  amply\r\n            supports a finding  that Plaintiffs were,\r\n            in fact,  in a position to  perform under\r\n            the  Agreement;\r\n\n               2.   Samuel   Sprafkin,   despite  his\r\n            fiduciary  obligation  to  Whitney  as  a\r\n            director   thereof,    actively   opposed\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n             implementation of the oral agreement that\r\n            Plaintiffs'    obligation    under    The\r\n            Agreement  would  be  prepayable  without\r\n            penalty;\r\n\n               3.

In\r\n            light of  all the evidence in  this case,\r\n            such testimony simply was not credible;\r\n\n               4.  Both  David  and  Samuel  Sprafkin\r\n            testified  that  prior to  being  shown a\r\n            copy   of The Agreement during the August\r\n            10,  1989,  meeting  at  the  Barenholtz'\r\n            home, they had forgotten  about it.  Such\r\n            testimony simply was not credible;\r\n\n               5.   Defendants'   sole   reason   for\r\n            proceeding to  trial after the  Court had\r\n            ruled on  the parties'  cross-motions for\r\n            summary   judgment   was  to   seek   the\r\n            utilization of the  Schimmel appraisal in\r\n            implementing   Article   Three   of   The\r\n            Agreement.   The Schimmel  appraisal was,\r\n            however, so lacking in factual foundation\r\n            that it would not have assisted the trier\r\n            of fact on the  issue of the  securities'\r\n            value.   It  thus would  have been  ruled\r\n            inadmissible  under  Rule  702,  Fed.

(In so stating,  the Court\r\n            adopts in toto the argument  set forth in\r                                    \r\n            the  Plaintiff's  Motion  to  Strike  the\r\n            Testimony   and  Report   of  Alfred   E.\r\n            Schimmel.)\r\n\n               Nonetheless, despite  both Defendants'\r\n            acknowledged duty as  trustees to advance\r\n            a competent  appraisal, see Tr.  VI, 118,\r\n            and   the  obvious   inadequacy  of   the\r\n            Schimmel appraisal, Defendants continued,\r\n            indeed continue, to endorse the  Schimmel\r\n            appraisal.\r\n\n               While  perhaps none  of the  foregoing\r\n            facts and findings, standing alone, would\r\n            persuade the  Court to  award Plaintiffs'\r\n            all of their  fees, the sum total  of the\r\n            delineated behavior  convinces the  Court\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n             that  such a  fee  award is  appropriate.\r\n            Indeed,    the    record   overwhelmingly\r\n            indicates  that  Plaintiffs  should never\r\n            have  had  to  institute this  action  to\r\n            enforce their clear right to purchase the\r\n            disputed  securities   pursuant  to   The\r\n            Agreement.

These principles, when combined with the\r\n\neffect of our reversal on  the prepayment issue, render the order\r\n\nassessing fees unsustainable.\r\n\n          The  district court predicated its first finding of bad\r\n\nfaith on the Defendants'  failure to advance expert  testimony in\r\n\nsupport  of their  earlier insistence  that  the Plaintiffs  were\r\n\nfinancially incapable  of performing.

In   their  cross-motion  for  summary   judgment,  the\r\n\nDefendants advanced eight grounds for resisting their obligations\r\n\nunder the Agreement.  The stated grounds  included the following:\r\n\n(1)   Whitney  Brothers'  financial   condition  would  not  have\r\n\npermitted  it to  make  the  installment  payments;  (2)  Whitney\r\n\nBrothers' funds were restricted because its bank had liens on the\r\n\ncompany's assets; and  (3) payment of the note  would be unlawful\r\n\nbecause, under  New Hampshire  corporate law,  a corporation  can\r\n\nrepurchase  its  own  shares   only  with  unrestricted  surplus.\r\n\nAlthough the district court's Summary Judgment Opinion holds that\r\n\nnone   of  the  stated  grounds  preclude  the  stock  repurchase\r\n\ncontemplated  by the  Agreement, neither  it  nor the  subsequent\r\n\norder imposing  fees explains how these defenses are frivolous or\r\n\nwhy they  were objectively  or subjectively  unreasonable at  the\r\n\ntime  they were advanced.

We\r                                                 \r\n\ntherefore  conclude that the district court abused its discretion\r\n\nwhen it based  the fee award on the  unexplicated conclusion that\r\n\nthe Sprafkins \"simply [were] not credible.\"\r\n\n          The court predicated  its fifth finding of bad faith on\r\n\nthe  Defendants' endorsement of  the Schimmel appraisal.   In its\r\n\norder, the  court found the  Schimmel appraisal to  be completely\r\n\nlacking   in   factual  foundation,   adopting   the  Plaintiffs'\r\n\ncontention that \"the trustees and their attorney found someone in\r\n\nMr. Schimmel  who would say  anything they wanted him  to say.\"10\r\n\nThe Order states  that the Defendants proceeded to  trial for the\r\n\nsole purpose of advancing the Schimmel appraisal \"despite [their]\r\n\nacknowledged  duty as trustees to advance a competent appraisal.\"\r\n\nThe  record  fully  supports this  finding,  indicating  that the\r\n\nSchimmel appraisal relied upon inflated rental and capitalization\r\n\nrates and disregarded the fact that the Whitney Brothers facility\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n10    The  district  court's   fee  order  adopted  in  toto  the\r                                                                      \r\nPlaintiffs' arguments  set forth  in their  Motion to  Strike the\r\nTestimony of Alfred E. Schimmel.\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n was located in an \"A-2  flood zone.\"11  The record  also supports\r\n\nthe  district court's  finding that  Schimmel neither  associated\r\n\nwith a \"qualified  local appraiser\" nor spent \"sufficient time to\r\n\nunderstand the  nuances of the  local market\" as required  by the\r\n\nAppraisal  Foundation's Standards  of  Professional Practice  and\r\n\nConduct.  Moreover, Michael Monks, a local industrial real estate\r\n\nbroker testified that the Sprafkins were aware of the infirmities\r\n\ninfecting the Schimmel opinion before  they advanced it at trial.\r\n\nConsequently, we find that the district court's fifth finding  of\r\n\nbad faith  was well  grounded in  the record  and set  forth with\r\n\nsufficient  particularity  and  is  accordingly  sustainable   on\r\n\nappeal.\r\n\n          The  district  court's  fee  order  indicated  that  it\r\n\npredicated  the fee  award  on  the  cumulative  effect  of  five\r\n\nspecific instances of alleged bad  faith and its finding that the\r\n\n\"record  overwhelmingly indicates  that  Plaintiffs should  never\r\n\nhave had to institute this action to enforce their clear right to\r\n\npurchase  the  disputed securities  pursuant  to  The Agreement.\"\r\n\nAlthough  we affirm  the fifth  finding of  bad faith,  the First\r\n\nAppeal obviated the second, and further examination of  the order\r\n\nseriously  undermines the facial validity of the remaining three.\r\n\nMoreover,   we  do  not  agree  that  the  record  overwhelmingly\r\n\nindicates that the Defendants improperly forced the Plaintiffs to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n11  Mr. Green testified that the area floods not only seasonally,\r\nbut also  during periods of  heavy rain.   We think the  district\r\ncourt  was  entitled to  find  that  this  data would  have  been\r\nconsidered in any competent appraisal.\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\n file  suit.   As we  noted  above, neither  the district  court's\r\n\nSummary Judgment Opinion nor the Order explains why  the defenses\r\n\nmaintained  by the  Defendants were  objectively or  subjectively\r\n\nunreasonable  when  asserted.   Perhaps  more  significantly, the\r\n\nDefendants  ultimately   prevailed  on   the  prepayment   issue,\r\n\napparently vindicating their rejection of the Plaintiffs' initial\r\n\ntenders.  This case  involves a complex set  of facts and  events\r\n\nthat occurred both in and out of court.  In the end, we think the\r\n\ndistrict  court's cursory  explanation of the  bases for  the fee\r\n\naward is  simply inadequate,  particularly in  light of  the fact\r\n\nthat no hearing was held on the issue.\r\n\n          We   remain   cognizant   of    the   Supreme   Court's\r\n\npronouncement that  appellate tribunals should  give deference to\r\n\nthe  district courts'  determinations on  sanctions  in order  to\r\n\n\"streamline  the litigation  process  by  freeing  the  appellate\r\n\ncourts from the duty of reweighing evidence . . . already weighed\r\n\nand considered by  the district court.\"  Cooter  &amp; Gell, 496 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 404.  In  the context of a  court's inherent powers,  however,\r\n\nthis  deference  is only  proper  where  the district  court  has\r\n\nexplained  its actions with  sufficient detail.   Accordingly, we\r\n\nfind that the  combined effect of our reversal  on the prepayment\r\n\nissue  and the district  court's failure to  adequately set forth\r\n\nits  justifications render its  imposition of attorneys'  fees an\r\n\nabuse of discretion.   We therefore  vacate the district  court's\r\n\nfee order and remand so that the district court can make specific\r\n\nfindings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n           Vacated.\r                           \r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n",

After two years of litigation, the district court ordered the sale at Defendants' asking price and held that the Plaintiffs were entitled to satisfy the purchase price with a prepayable promissory note.  The district court also concluded that the Defendants had resisted their obligations under the buy/sell agreement in bad faith, and accordingly used its inherent powers to shift the Plaintiffs' attorneys' fees.  The district court predicated its bad faith finding on, inter alia, the Defendants' continuous insistence that the purchase price was not prepayable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, we reversed the district court's judgment with respect to prepayment.  The Defendants filed a Motion to Reconsider the imposition of attorneys' fees in light of our reversal on the prepayability of the note.  The district court held that the fee award was still justified but amended it to exclude fees earned in connection with the prepayment issue.  Defendants now appeal.  For the following reasons, we vacate that portion of the court's order imposing fees and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whitney Brothers is a New Hampshire corporation that produces wooden learning materials.  Bernard Barenholtz acquired 62.6% of the company's outstanding shares in 1969.  Ten years later, he transferred these shares to the Bernard M. Barenholtz Trust (the \"Trust\") and named himself and defendant David Sprafkin trustees.  Plaintiff Griffin Stabler owned 32.7% of the shares, and his son, David Stabler, owned the remaining 4.7%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 27, 1987, Whitney Brothers, the trustees, and Griffin Stabler executed a written buy/sell agreement (\"The Agreement\").  Under The Agreement, Whitney Brothers would buy the Trust's shares within ninety days of the death of Bernard Barenholtz and buy Griffin Stabler's shares within ninety days of Stabler's death.  To determine the purchase price, the parties would plug an agreed-upon appraisal into a formula to determine the purchase price.  If the parties could not agree on an appraisal, they would each get their own and plug the average into the formula.  The contract also provided for payment by a promissory note, with monthly installments over ten years at 10% interest per annum.  The Agreement did not mention whether prepayment of the note was permissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 3, 1987, Bernard Barenholtz' (and Defendants') attorney Samuel M. Sprafkin wrote a letter advising Mr. Barenholtz that the promissory note should be prepayable without penalty.  The district court found that the parties orally agreed to the letter's prepayment provision.  Barenholtz then placed the letter in a file with the written contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Bernard Barenholtz died, on August 5, 1989, his daughter, defendant Joan Barenholtz, assumed his trustee position.  A few days later, plaintiff Stabler and defendant Sprafkin discussed the contract's required stock sale.  One of the parties asked E.F. Greene to update a past appraisal of Whitney Brothers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Sprafkin rejected Greene's appraisal;  Whitney Brothers accepted it.  Relying on Greene's appraisal, Whitney Brothers tendered to Defendants a prepayable promissory note for $1,178,000 for the stock.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead of responding immediately, Defendants secured a significantly higher appraisal from Alfred Schimmel, a real estate appraiser from New York City.  They then rejected Whitney Brothers' tender by letter, without mentioning the note's prepayment clause.  When Stabler learned of Defendants' appraisal, he rejected it as too high.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, Plaintiffs sued to compel the transfer of the stock.  Ten months later, on December 13, 1990, as part of their cross-motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs offered to tender either $1,349,343<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> immediately or, if the court found that The Agreement did not permit prepayment, that amount over ten years at 10% interest.  Defendants again rejected the tender.  They now contend that they rejected it because:  (1) it omitted $145,000 worth of interest that had accrued since November 3, 1989, 90 days after the death of Bernard Barenholtz, and (2) it was invalid because the first option permitted prepayment, and the second option was conditioned upon a court judgment that prepayment was prohibited.  Plaintiffs maintain that the Defendants continually and in bad faith resisted their obligations under The Agreement so that they could sell the stock to one of Whitney Brothers' competitors at a higher price.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court:  (1) ordered Defendants to sell their stock;  (2) found that Plaintiffs were not entitled to prepay the note;  and (3) decided that a trial was necessary on the issue of the stock price.  See Whitney Bros. Co. v. Sprafkin, No. 90-54-S (D.N.H. filed June 5, 1991) (the \"Summary Judgment Opinion\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a six-day trial, the court issued an order in which it:  (1) required the Plaintiffs to pay $1,349,343 for the stock;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  (2) reconsidered and reversed, sua sponte, its previous order and ruled that the parties' oral agreement regarding the prepayability of the note was binding and, therefore, that the Plaintiffs could pay for the stock with a prepayable promissory note;  (3) ruled that interest on the note would begin to accrue when it was executed, and not before;  and (4) used its inherent powers to assess attorneys' fees against the Defendants based on their bad faith conduct throughout the litigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Whitney Bros. Co. v. Sprafkin, No. 90-054-S, 1992 WL 686272 (D.N.H. Sept. 30, 1992) (\"the Order\").  The Order cited the Defendants' refusal to accept a prepayable note despite their oral agreement to do so as one of five instances of their bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal (the \"First Appeal\"), we, inter alia, reversed the district court's judgment with respect to the prepayability of the note, holding that The Agreement precluded the Plaintiffs' efforts to prepay regardless of whether a subsequent oral agreement provided for prepayment.

Sprafkin, 3 F.3d 530 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants then filed a motion asking that the court reconsider the imposition of attorneys' fees in light of our reversal on the prepayment issue.  The court denied the Motion to Reconsider without a hearing,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> holding that the integrity of the court's previous bad faith finding was not damaged by this Court's reversal on the prepayment issue.  The court did, however, amend the fee award to exclude all fees earned in connection with the prepayment issue.  Defendants now appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's imposition of sanctions under its inherent power for an abuse of discretion, Chambers v. NASCO, 501 U.S. 32, 55, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 2138, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991), giving recognition to the premise that the \"district court is better situated than the court of appeals to marshal the pertinent facts and apply the fact-dependent legal standard\" that informs its determination as to whether sanctions are warranted.  Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 402, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 2459, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990).  We nonetheless remain mindful that a \"district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\"  Id. at 405, 110 S.Ct. at 2461.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue before us is whether the district court's imposition of attorneys' fees constitutes an abuse of discretion, particularly in light of our reversal on the prepayment issue.  The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants raised frivolous defenses in bad faith solely to avoid their obligations under The Agreement so that they could sell the securities to one of Whitney Brothers' competitors at a higher price.  Accordingly, the Plaintiffs contend, the fee award is appropriate despite our reversal on the prepayment issue.  The Defendants maintain that they resisted the Plaintiffs' attempts to implement The Agreement in good faith because, inter alia, (1) the Plaintiffs insisted that the note was prepayable, and (2) they were legitimately concerned that the Plaintiffs were both financially and legally incapable of fulfilling their obligations under The Agreement.  The Defendants further maintain that our reversal on the prepayment issue completely justifies their position throughout the course of the litigation, and that the district court therefore abused its discretion in assessing attorneys' fees against them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to the original finding of bad faith, the district court stated the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>A retrospective look at this litigation reveals Defendants' bad faith in resisting their obligation to perform under The Agreement.  In support of its bad faith ruling, the Court makes the following observations and findings:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  In initially resisting their obligation under The Agreement, Defendants relied primarily upon the argument that Plaintiffs were not financially able to perform.  However, Defendants advanced no expert opinion either to support their claim or to counter the opinion of Plaintiffs' expert that Plaintiffs were indeed ready and able to perform.  Moreover, The Agreement itself certainly did not explicitly contemplate the sort of financial \"veto power\" Defendants attempted to assert in the earlier stages of this case.  Finally, an examination of the financial data advanced by Plaintiffs' amply supports a finding that Plaintiffs were, in fact, in a position to perform under The Agreement;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Samuel Sprafkin, despite his fiduciary obligation to Whitney as a director thereof, actively opposed implementation of the oral agreement that Plaintiffs' obligation under The Agreement would be prepayable without penalty;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.  Both David and Samuel Sprafkin testified that Samuel Sprafkin did not speak with E.F. Greene during the course of the August 10, 1989, meeting.  In light of all the evidence in this case, such testimony simply was not credible;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4.  Both David and Samuel Sprafkin testified that prior to being shown a copy of The Agreement during the August 10, 1989, meeting at the Barenholtz' home, they had forgotten about it.  Such testimony simply was not credible;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5.  Defendants' sole reason for proceeding to trial after the Court had ruled on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment was to seek the utilization of the Schimmel appraisal in implementing Article Three of The Agreement.  The Schimmel appraisal was, however, so lacking in factual foundation that it would not have assisted the trier of fact on the issue of the securities' value.  It thus would have been ruled inadmissible under Rule 702, Fed.R.Evid., were the price issue not resolved at the summary judgment stage of these proceedings.  (In so stating, the Court adopts in toto the argument set forth in the Plaintiff's Motion to Strike the Testimony and Report of Alfred E. Schimmel.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, despite both Defendants' acknowledged duty as trustees to advance a competent appraisal, see Tr. VI, 118, and the obvious inadequacy of the Schimmel appraisal, Defendants continued, indeed continue, to endorse the Schimmel appraisal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While perhaps none of the foregoing facts and findings, standing alone, would persuade the Court to award Plaintiffs' all of their fees, the sum total of the delineated behavior convinces the Court that such a fee award is appropriate.  Indeed, the record overwhelmingly indicates that Plaintiffs should never have had to institute this action to enforce their clear right to purchase the disputed securities pursuant to The Agreement.<sup>17</sup><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Accordingly, the Court rules that Plaintiffs are entitled to recover their attorneys' fees from Defendants....<sup>18</sup><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whitney Bros. Co., No. 90-054-S, 1992 WL 686272 at * 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must first analyze whether our reversal on the prepayment issue significantly affects the overall integrity of the fee award.  The order states that \"the record overwhelmingly indicates that Plaintiffs should never have had to institute this action to enforce their clear right to purchase the disputed securities pursuant to The Agreement.\"   It enumerates five instances of alleged bad faith, including the Defendants' continuous insistence that the debt was not prepayable, and clearly states that the fee award is predicated on the \"sum total of the delineated behavior.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Accordingly, because our reversal on the prepayability issue undermines the fee award, we therefore must determine whether the other enumerated instances of bad faith are sufficient to support the fee award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by emphasizing that the district court assessed the fees pursuant to the court's \"inherent power\" to \"manage [its] own affairs.\"  Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 630-31, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 1389, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962).  It is beyond serious dispute that a district court may use its inherent powers to assess attorneys' fees against a party that has \" 'acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons,' \" Chambers, 501 U.S. at 45-46, 111 S.Ct. at 2133 (quoting Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240, 258-59, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 1622, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975));  see also Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752, 765-66, 100 S.Ct. 2455, 2463-64, 65 L.Ed.2d 488 (1980) (recognizing \"bad faith\" exception to general rule that federal courts cannot ordinarily make fee-shifting awards);  Jones v. Winnepesaukee Realty, et al, 990 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1993) (citations omitted).  Nevertheless, \"[b]ecause of their very potency, inherent powers must be exercised with restraint and discretion.\"  Chambers, 501 U.S. at 44, 111 S.Ct. at 2132 (citation omitted).  Accordingly, a court's inherent power to shift attorneys' fees \"should be used sparingly and reserved for egregious circumstances.\"  Jones, 990 F.2d at 3.   Significantly, we have held that a district court exercising its inherent powers in this fashion must describe the bad faith conduct with \"sufficient specificity,\" accompanied by a \"detailed explanation of the reasons justifying the award.\"   See Gradmann &amp; Holler v. Continental, 679 F.2d 272, 274 (1st Cir.1982) (vacating fee award for district court's failure to provide a sufficiently detailed justification) (citing F.D. Rich Co. v. United States ex rel. Industrial Lumber Co., 417 U.S. 116, 129, 94 S.Ct. 2157, 2165, 40 L.Ed.2d 703 (1974));  cf. Jones, 990 F.2d at 3-4 (holding that the district court's \"specific, meticulously detailed finding of bad faith\" was supportable on appeal).  These principles, when combined with the effect of our reversal on the prepayment issue, render the order assessing fees unsustainable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court predicated its first finding of bad faith on the Defendants' failure to advance expert testimony in support of their earlier insistence that the Plaintiffs were financially incapable of performing.  We agree that a district court could find bad faith where a party maintains an unfounded action or defense without any reasonable hope of prevailing on merits.  See Chambers, 501 U.S. 32, 111 S.Ct. 2123;  see also Perichak v. International Union of Elec. Radio &amp; Machine Workers, Local 601, AFL-CIO, 715 F.2d 78, 83 (1978) (awarding fees because plaintiff brought action without \"any reasonable prospect of prevailing on the merits\");  Nemeroff v. Abelson, 704 F.2d 652, 659-60 (2d Cir.1983) (affirming an award of fees based on a finding of bad faith in maintaining an action after it became clear that the claim was no longer colorable).  Nevertheless, the facts here are not so clear.  In their cross-motion for summary judgment, the Defendants advanced eight grounds for resisting their obligations under the Agreement.  The stated grounds included the following:  (1) Whitney Brothers' financial condition would not have permitted it to make the installment payments;  (2) Whitney Brothers' funds were restricted because its bank had liens on the company's assets;  and (3) payment of the note would be unlawful because, under New Hampshire corporate law, a corporation can repurchase its own shares only with unrestricted surplus.  Although the district court's Summary Judgment Opinion holds that none of the stated grounds preclude the stock repurchase contemplated by the Agreement, neither it nor the subsequent order imposing fees explains how these defenses are frivolous or why they were objectively or subjectively unreasonable at the time they were advanced.  Cf. Blue v. U.S. Dept. of Army, 914 F.2d 525, 544 (4th Cir.1990) (finding that district court's claim-by-claim description of the frivolous nature of the plaintiffs' complaint demonstrated clearly that their \"widespread charges of racial discrimination [were leveled] without any regard for the truth ... in order to harass and embarrass the personnel at Fort Bragg\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third and fourth instances of bad faith were predicated on the district court's belief that both David and Samuel Sprafkin had offered testimony that \"simply was not credible.\"   We have no doubt that when a party has materially perjured himself, this, standing alone, is sufficient grounds for finding bad faith.  See Chambers, 501 U.S. at 46, 111 S.Ct. at 2133 (noting that the \"inherent power extends to a full range of litigation abuses);  see also Perichak, 715 F.2d at 84-85 &amp; n. 9 (3d Cir.1983) (holding that the defendant's \" 'materially false statements [made] under oath' are, having been critical to the success of his case, alone, enough to support a finding of bad faith\");  Carrion v. Yeshiva University, 535 F.2d 722 (2d Cir.1976) (affirming fee award after a civil rights bench trial where the court found that plaintiff's testimony was an \"unmitigated tissue of lies\").  However, \"[a] factfinder's decision that one party's version of the events is more credible than the other party's is, without more, insufficient to justify an award of attorneys' fees....\"  Roth v. Pritikin, 787 F.2d 54, 58 (2d Cir.1986) (discussing fee awards under the Copyright Act);  see also Blue, 914 F.2d at 544 (noting that \"not every instance in which a district court credits one side's witnesses over another's is an occasion for sanctions\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court merely stated that the Sprafkins' testimony, \"[i]n light of all the evidence in this case, ... simply was not credible.\"   It set forth no explanation for this conclusion.  We think that a district court cannot predicate the use of its inherent powers on a mere conclusory statement that the witnesses were not credible.  Cf. Blue, 914 F.2d at 544 (holding that although the fee award was assessed against plaintiffs in a complex civil rights suit, it was proper because the district court's order imposing fees meticulously describes each instance of perjury and bad faith).  Because the district court neither explained why it concluded that the Sprafkins had perjured themselves nor explained why any allegedly untrue statements were material, we cannot say that the bad faith conduct was described with \"sufficient specificity\" or accompanied by a \"detailed explanation of the reasons justifying the award.\"   See Gradmann &amp; Holler, 679 F.2d at 274.   We therefore conclude that the district court abused its discretion when it based the fee award on the unexplicated conclusion that the Sprafkins \"simply [were] not credible.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court predicated its fifth finding of bad faith on the Defendants' endorsement of the Schimmel appraisal.  In its order, the court found the Schimmel appraisal to be completely lacking in factual foundation, adopting the Plaintiffs' contention that \"the trustees and their attorney found someone in Mr. Schimmel who would say anything they wanted him to say.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  The Order states that the Defendants proceeded to trial for the sole purpose of advancing the Schimmel appraisal \"despite [their] acknowledged duty as trustees to advance a competent appraisal.\"   The record fully supports this finding, indicating that the Schimmel appraisal relied upon inflated rental and capitalization rates and disregarded the fact that the Whitney Brothers facility was located in an \"A-2 flood zone.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The record also supports the district court's finding that Schimmel neither associated with a \"qualified local appraiser\" nor spent \"sufficient time to understand the nuances of the local market\" as required by the Appraisal Foundation's Standards of Professional Practice and Conduct.  Moreover, Michael Monks, a local industrial real estate broker testified that the Sprafkins were aware of the infirmities infecting the Schimmel opinion before they advanced it at trial.  Consequently, we find that the district court's fifth finding of bad faith was well grounded in the record and set forth with sufficient particularity and is accordingly sustainable on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's fee order indicated that it predicated the fee award on the cumulative effect of five specific instances of alleged bad faith and its finding that the \"record overwhelmingly indicates that Plaintiffs should never have had to institute this action to enforce their clear right to purchase the disputed securities pursuant to The Agreement.\"   Although we affirm the fifth finding of bad faith, the First Appeal obviated the second, and further examination of the order seriously undermines the facial validity of the remaining three.  Moreover, we do not agree that the record overwhelmingly indicates that the Defendants improperly forced the Plaintiffs to file suit.  As we noted above, neither the district court's Summary Judgment Opinion nor the Order explains why the defenses maintained by the Defendants were objectively or subjectively unreasonable when asserted.  Perhaps more significantly, the Defendants ultimately prevailed on the prepayment issue, apparently vindicating their rejection of the Plaintiffs' initial tenders.  This case involves a complex set of facts and events that occurred both in and out of court.  In the end, we think the district court's cursory explanation of the bases for the fee award is simply inadequate, particularly in light of the fact that no hearing was held on the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We remain cognizant of the Supreme Court's pronouncement that appellate tribunals should give deference to the district courts' determinations on sanctions in order to \"streamline the litigation process by freeing the appellate courts from the duty of reweighing evidence ... already weighed and considered by the district court.\"  Cooter &amp; Gell, 496 U.S. at 404, 110 S.Ct. at 2460.   In the context of a court's inherent powers, however, this deference is only proper where the district court has explained its actions with sufficient detail.  Accordingly, we find that the combined effect of our reversal on the prepayment issue and the district court's failure to adequately set forth its justifications render its imposition of attorneys' fees an abuse of discretion.  We therefore vacate the district court's fee order and remand so that the district court can make specific findings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The parties disagree over who requested the update</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Defendants contend that Stabler made the tender knowing that they did not accept Greene's appraisal and planned to obtain one of their own</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This was the price calculated under the contract by plugging the average of the two appraisals into the formula</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The court held that the Plaintiffs were bound by their summary-judgment-motion stipulation that the stock price was $1,349,343</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Although the parties briefed the issue, the district court imposed the fee award without the benefit of a hearing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Judge Stahl, who presided over the trial and issued the Order, requested that the matter be assigned to another judge after he was appointed to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.

Plaintiffs/appellees are Whitney Brothers Company (\"Whitney Brothers\") and Griffin M. Stabler, Whitney Brothers' president, chief executive officer and director.  Defendants/appellants, David C. Sprafkin and Joan Barenholtz, are the trustees of the Bernard M. Barenholtz Trust, Whitney Brothers' majority shareholder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the underlying litigation, Plaintiffs sued to compel Defendants to sell their stock in Whitney Brothers pursuant to a written buy/sell contract.  After two years of litigation, the district court ordered the sale at Defendants' asking price and held that the Plaintiffs were entitled to satisfy the purchase price with a prepayable promissory note.  The district court also concluded that the Defendants had resisted their obligations under the buy/sell agreement in bad faith, and accordingly used its inherent powers to shift the Plaintiffs' attorneys' fees.  The district court predicated its bad faith finding on, inter alia, the Defendants' continuous insistence that the purchase price was not prepayable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, we reversed the district court's judgment with respect to prepayment.  The Defendants filed a Motion to Reconsider the imposition of attorneys' fees in light of our reversal on the prepayability of the note.  The district court held that the fee award was still justified but amended it to exclude fees earned in connection with the prepayment issue.  Defendants now appeal.  For the following reasons, we vacate that portion of the court's order imposing fees and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whitney Brothers is a New Hampshire corporation that produces wooden learning materials.  Bernard Barenholtz acquired 62.6% of the company's outstanding shares in 1969.  Ten years later, he transferred these shares to the Bernard M. Barenholtz Trust (the \"Trust\") and named himself and defendant David Sprafkin trustees.  Plaintiff Griffin Stabler owned 32.7% of the shares, and his son, David Stabler, owned the remaining 4.7%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 27, 1987, Whitney Brothers, the trustees, and Griffin Stabler executed a written buy/sell agreement (\"The Agreement\").  Under The Agreement, Whitney Brothers would buy the Trust's shares within ninety days of the death of Bernard Barenholtz and buy Griffin Stabler's shares within ninety days of Stabler's death.  To determine the purchase price, the parties would plug an agreed-upon appraisal into a formula to determine the purchase price.  If the parties could not agree on an appraisal, they would each get their own and plug the average into the formula.  The contract also provided for payment by a promissory note, with monthly installments over ten years at 10% interest per annum.  The Agreement did not mention whether prepayment of the note was permissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 3, 1987, Bernard Barenholtz' (and Defendants') attorney Samuel M. Sprafkin wrote a letter advising Mr. Barenholtz that the promissory note should be prepayable without penalty.  The district court found that the parties orally agreed to the letter's prepayment provision.  Barenholtz then placed the letter in a file with the written contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Bernard Barenholtz died, on August 5, 1989, his daughter, defendant Joan Barenholtz, assumed his trustee position.  A few days later, plaintiff Stabler and defendant Sprafkin discussed the contract's required stock sale.  One of the parties asked E.F. Greene to update a past appraisal of Whitney Brothers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Sprafkin rejected Greene's appraisal;  Whitney Brothers accepted it.  Relying on Greene's appraisal, Whitney Brothers tendered to Defendants a prepayable promissory note for $1,178,000 for the stock.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead of responding immediately, Defendants secured a significantly higher appraisal from Alfred Schimmel, a real estate appraiser from New York City.  They then rejected Whitney Brothers' tender by letter, without mentioning the note's prepayment clause.  When Stabler learned of Defendants' appraisal, he rejected it as too high.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, Plaintiffs sued to compel the transfer of the stock.  Ten months later, on December 13, 1990, as part of their cross-motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs offered to tender either $1,349,343<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> immediately or, if the court found that The Agreement did not permit prepayment, that amount over ten years at 10% interest.  Defendants again rejected the tender.  They now contend that they rejected it because:  (1) it omitted $145,000 worth of interest that had accrued since November 3, 1989, 90 days after the death of Bernard Barenholtz, and (2) it was invalid because the first option permitted prepayment, and the second option was conditioned upon a court judgment that prepayment was prohibited.  Plaintiffs maintain that the Defendants continually and in bad faith resisted their obligations under The Agreement so that they could sell the stock to one of Whitney Brothers' competitors at a higher price.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court:  (1) ordered Defendants to sell their stock;  (2) found that Plaintiffs were not entitled to prepay the note;  and (3) decided that a trial was necessary on the issue of the stock price.  See Whitney Bros. Co. v. Sprafkin, No. 90-54-S (D.N.H. filed June 5, 1991) (the \"Summary Judgment Opinion\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a six-day trial, the court issued an order in which it:  (1) required the Plaintiffs to pay $1,349,343 for the stock;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  (2) reconsidered and reversed, sua sponte, its previous order and ruled that the parties' oral agreement regarding the prepayability of the note was binding and, therefore, that the Plaintiffs could pay for the stock with a prepayable promissory note;  (3) ruled that interest on the note would begin to accrue when it was executed, and not before;  and (4) used its inherent powers to assess attorneys' fees against the Defendants based on their bad faith conduct throughout the litigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Whitney Bros.

The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants raised frivolous defenses in bad faith solely to avoid their obligations under The Agreement so that they could sell the securities to one of Whitney Brothers' competitors at a higher price.  Accordingly, the Plaintiffs contend, the fee award is appropriate despite our reversal on the prepayment issue.  The Defendants maintain that they resisted the Plaintiffs' attempts to implement The Agreement in good faith because, inter alia, (1) the Plaintiffs insisted that the note was prepayable, and (2) they were legitimately concerned that the Plaintiffs were both financially and legally incapable of fulfilling their obligations under The Agreement.  The Defendants further maintain that our reversal on the prepayment issue completely justifies their position throughout the course of the litigation, and that the district court therefore abused its discretion in assessing attorneys' fees against them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to the original finding of bad faith, the district court stated the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>A retrospective look at this litigation reveals Defendants' bad faith in resisting their obligation to perform under The Agreement.  In support of its bad faith ruling, the Court makes the following observations and findings:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  In initially resisting their obligation under The Agreement, Defendants relied primarily upon the argument that Plaintiffs were not financially able to perform.  However, Defendants advanced no expert opinion either to support their claim or to counter the opinion of Plaintiffs' expert that Plaintiffs were indeed ready and able to perform.  Moreover, The Agreement itself certainly did not explicitly contemplate the sort of financial \"veto power\" Defendants attempted to assert in the earlier stages of this case.  Finally, an examination of the financial data advanced by Plaintiffs' amply supports a finding that Plaintiffs were, in fact, in a position to perform under The Agreement;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Samuel Sprafkin, despite his fiduciary obligation to Whitney as a director thereof, actively opposed implementation of the oral agreement that Plaintiffs' obligation under The Agreement would be prepayable without penalty;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.  Both David and Samuel Sprafkin testified that Samuel Sprafkin did not speak with E.F. Greene during the course of the August 10, 1989, meeting.  In light of all the evidence in this case, such testimony simply was not credible;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4.  Both David and Samuel Sprafkin testified that prior to being shown a copy of The Agreement during the August 10, 1989, meeting at the Barenholtz' home, they had forgotten about it.  Such testimony simply was not credible;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5.  Defendants' sole reason for proceeding to trial after the Court had ruled on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment was to seek the utilization of the Schimmel appraisal in implementing Article Three of The Agreement.  The Schimmel appraisal was, however, so lacking in factual foundation that it would not have assisted the trier of fact on the issue of the securities' value.  It thus would have been ruled inadmissible under Rule 702, Fed.R.Evid., were the price issue not resolved at the summary judgment stage of these proceedings.  (In so stating, the Court adopts in toto the argument set forth in the Plaintiff's Motion to Strike the Testimony and Report of Alfred E. Schimmel.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, despite both Defendants' acknowledged duty as trustees to advance a competent appraisal, see Tr. VI, 118, and the obvious inadequacy of the Schimmel appraisal, Defendants continued, indeed continue, to endorse the Schimmel appraisal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While perhaps none of the foregoing facts and findings, standing alone, would persuade the Court to award Plaintiffs' all of their fees, the sum total of the delineated behavior convinces the Court that such a fee award is appropriate.

Nevertheless, the facts here are not so clear.  In their cross-motion for summary judgment, the Defendants advanced eight grounds for resisting their obligations under the Agreement.  The stated grounds included the following:  (1) Whitney Brothers' financial condition would not have permitted it to make the installment payments;  (2) Whitney Brothers' funds were restricted because its bank had liens on the company's assets;  and (3) payment of the note would be unlawful because, under New Hampshire corporate law, a corporation can repurchase its own shares only with unrestricted surplus.  Although the district court's Summary Judgment Opinion holds that none of the stated grounds preclude the stock repurchase contemplated by the Agreement, neither it nor the subsequent order imposing fees explains how these defenses are frivolous or why they were objectively or subjectively unreasonable at the time they were advanced.

U.S. Dept. of Army, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548363\"><a href=\"/opinion/548363/sandra-l-blue-and-mattiebelle-c-harris-samuel-p-sheppard-edward-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span>, 544 (4th Cir.1990) (finding that district court's claim-by-claim description of the frivolous nature of the plaintiffs' complaint demonstrated clearly that their \"widespread charges of racial discrimination [were leveled] without any regard for the truth ... in order to harass and embarrass the personnel at Fort Bragg\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third and fourth instances of bad faith were predicated on the district court's belief that both David and Samuel Sprafkin had offered testimony that \"simply was not credible.\"   We have no doubt that when a party has materially perjured himself, this, standing alone, is sufficient grounds for finding bad faith.

We think that a district court cannot predicate the use of its inherent powers on a mere conclusory statement that the witnesses were not credible.  Cf. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548363\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Blue,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/548363/sandra-l-blue-and-mattiebelle-c-harris-samuel-p-sheppard-edward-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">544</span> </a></span>(holding that although the fee award was assessed against plaintiffs in a complex civil rights suit, it was proper because the district court's order imposing fees meticulously describes each instance of perjury and bad faith).  Because the district court neither explained why it concluded that the Sprafkins had perjured themselves nor explained why any allegedly untrue statements were material, we cannot say that the bad faith conduct was described with \"sufficient specificity\" or accompanied by a \"detailed explanation of the reasons justifying the award.\"   See Gradmann &amp; <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"404112\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Holler,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/404112/gradmann-holler-gmbh-v-continental-lines-sa-gradmann-holler-gmbh/\"><span class=\"volume\">679</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>.   We therefore conclude that the district court abused its discretion when it based the fee award on the unexplicated conclusion that the Sprafkins \"simply [were] not credible.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court predicated its fifth finding of bad faith on the Defendants' endorsement of the Schimmel appraisal.  In its order, the court found the Schimmel appraisal to be completely lacking in factual foundation, adopting the Plaintiffs' contention that \"the trustees and their attorney found someone in Mr. Schimmel who would say anything they wanted him to say.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  The Order states that the Defendants proceeded to trial for the sole purpose of advancing the Schimmel appraisal \"despite [their] acknowledged duty as trustees to advance a competent appraisal.\"   The record fully supports this finding, indicating that the Schimmel appraisal relied upon inflated rental and capitalization rates and disregarded the fact that the Whitney Brothers facility was located in an \"A-2 flood zone.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The record also supports the district court's finding that Schimmel neither associated with a \"qualified local appraiser\" nor spent \"sufficient time to understand the nuances of the local market\" as required by the Appraisal Foundation's Standards of Professional Practice and Conduct.  Moreover, Michael Monks, a local industrial real estate broker testified that the Sprafkins were aware of the infirmities infecting the Schimmel opinion before they advanced it at trial.  Consequently, we find that the district court's fifth finding of bad faith was well grounded in the record and set forth with sufficient particularity and is accordingly sustainable on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's fee order indicated that it predicated the fee award on the cumulative effect of five specific instances of alleged bad faith and its finding that the \"record overwhelmingly indicates that Plaintiffs should never have had to institute this action to enforce their clear right to purchase the disputed securities pursuant to The Agreement.\"   Although we affirm the fifth finding of bad faith, the First Appeal obviated the second, and further examination of the order seriously undermines the facial validity of the remaining three.  Moreover, we do not agree that the record overwhelmingly indicates that the Defendants improperly forced the Plaintiffs to file suit.  As we noted above, neither the district court's Summary Judgment Opinion nor the Order explains why the defenses maintained by the Defendants were objectively or subjectively unreasonable when asserted.  Perhaps more significantly, the Defendants ultimately prevailed on the prepayment issue, apparently vindicating their rejection of the Plaintiffs' initial tenders.  This case involves a complex set of facts and events that occurred both in and out of court.  In the end, we think the district court's cursory explanation of the bases for the fee award is simply inadequate, particularly in light of the fact that no hearing was held on the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We remain cognizant of the Supreme Court's pronouncement that appellate tribunals should give deference to the district courts' determinations on sanctions in order to \"streamline the litigation process by freeing the appellate courts from the duty of reweighing evidence ... already weighed and considered by the district court.\"  Cooter &amp; <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112457\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gell,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112457/cooter-gell-v-hartmarx-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span>, 110 S.Ct. at 2460.   In the context of a court's inherent powers, however, this deference is only proper where the district court has explained its actions with sufficient detail.  Accordingly, we find that the combined effect of our reversal on the prepayment issue and the district court's failure to adequately set forth its justifications render its imposition of attorneys' fees an abuse of discretion.  We therefore vacate the district court's fee order and remand so that the district court can make specific findings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The parties disagree over who requested the update</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Defendants contend that Stabler made the tender knowing that they did not accept Greene's appraisal and planned to obtain one of their own</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This was the price calculated under the contract by plugging the average of the two appraisals into the formula</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The court held that the Plaintiffs were bound by their summary-judgment-motion stipulation that the stock price was $1,349,343</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Although the parties briefed the issue, the district court imposed the fee award without the benefit of a hearing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Judge Stahl, who presided over the trial and issued the Order, requested that the matter be assigned to another judge after he was appointed to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.
