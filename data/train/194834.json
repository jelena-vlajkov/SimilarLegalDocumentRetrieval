In  this  criminal  appeal,\n          SELYA,  Circuit  Judge.\n                                \n\ndefendant-appellant Omar Martin Zapata-Medina (Zapata), an alien,\n\nclaims  that the  court below  impermissibly \"double  counted\" in\n\ncalculating  the guideline sentencing  range (GSR)  applicable to\n\nhis  case.    Concluding  that  Zapata's  sentence  was  lawfully\n\nconstituted, we affirm.\n\n                                I\n\n          The  facts relevant  to this  appeal are  not disputed.\n\nThe government deported Zapata  in 1990, following his conviction\n\non a state drug-trafficking  charge for which he served  142 days\n\nin  prison (the remainder of  his term of  immurement having been\n\nsuspended).    Under  applicable  federal  law,  Zapata's   prior\n\nconviction is classified as an aggravated felony.  See 8 U.S.C.  \n                                                      \n\n1101(a)(43).   The deportation did not stick:  Zapata returned to\n\nthe  United States sub rosa  in 1992.   Once apprehended, he pled\n                           \n\nguilty  to a  charge that he  had violated  8 U.S.C.    1326(a) &amp;\n\n(b)(2).1\n\n          At sentencing,  the district  court calculated Zapata's\n\noffense level  and criminal history category (CHC)  in the manner\n\ndirected  by  the  federal  sentencing guidelines.2    The  court\n\n                    \n\n     1These  subsections  stipulate  in  the  aggregate that  any\n\"alien  who .  . .  has been  arrested and  deported .  . .,  and\nthereafter  . .  . is  . . .  found in  . .  . the  United States\n[without the express consent of the Attorney General, and] . .  .\nwhose deportation  was subsequent to a  conviction for commission\nof an aggravated felony, . . . shall be [punished as provided].\"\n\n     2As  a matter of general  interest, we note  that Zapata was\nsentenced on December 1, 1992; hence, the November,  1992 version\nof  the guidelines applied.  See United States v. Harotunian, 920\n                                                            \nF.2d 1040, 1041-42  (1st Cir. 1990) (directing that, except where\n\n                                2\n\nstarted  with a  base  offense level  of  eight, see  U.S.S.G.   \n                                                    \n\n2L1.2(a),  increased  the  offense   level  to  twenty-four,  see\n                                                                 \n\nU.S.S.G.   2L1.2(b)(2) (directing  a sixteen-level increase for a\n\ndefendant who has entered  the United States unlawfully following\n\ndeportation \"after  a conviction for an  aggravated felony\"), and\n\nsubtracted three  levels for  acceptance  of responsibility,  see\n                                                                 \n\nU.S.S.G.   3E1.1, thereby  reaching an adjusted offense  level of\n\ntwenty-one.\n\n          The district  court's calculation of  Zapata's CHC lies\n\nat the heart  of this appeal.   Under   U.S.S.G.   4A1.1(b),  two\n\ncriminal  history points are to be added \"for each prior sentence\n\nof  imprisonment\" of  sixty  days  or  more.    The  term  \"prior\n\nsentence\"   means   \"any   sentence   previously   imposed   upon\n\nadjudication of guilt, whether by guilty plea [or otherwise], for\n\nconduct  not   part  of  the   instant  offense.\"     U.S.S.G.   \n\n4A1.2(a)(1).   The district court invoked  this provision, adding\n\ntwo  points to Zapata's criminal  history score by  reason of the\n\nprior  narcotics  conviction   (notwithstanding  that  the  prior\n\nconviction  had already  been  used  to  ratchet up  his  offense\n\nlevel).  The  two criminal history points  boosted appellant over\n\nthe line into CHC II and upped the GSR to 41-51 months.\n\n          After the district  court sentenced appellant to forty-\n\n                    \n\nnecessary to  avoid ex post facto problems, \"a defendant is to be\n                                 \npunished  in   accordance  with  the  guidelines   in  effect  at\nsentencing\").  Although the district court signalled an intention\nto use the November, 1991 version of the guidelines, this appears\nto have been a slip of  the tongue.  Because the district court's\ncalculations  faithfully track  the  November, 1992  version,  we\ndisregard the lapsus linguae.\n                            \n\n                                3\n\none months in  prison, this appeal arose.   In it, Zapata assigns\n\nerror solely  to the  double counting  of his  original narcotics\n\nconviction.\n\n                                II\n\n          In  the  sentencing  context,  double  counting   is  a\n\nphenomenon  that is  less sinister  than the  name implies.   The\n\npractice is often  perfectly proper.   This case illustrates  the\n\npoint:  the double  counting in which the district  court engaged\n\ndid  not stray  into forbidden  territory.   Rather, the  court's\n\nmethodology   carefully   tracked  the   Sentencing  Commission's\n\ninterpretive  comment, which states  specifically that an offense\n\nlevel  increase  for  a  prior felony  conviction  under  section\n\n2L1.2(b)  \"applies in  addition  to any  criminal history  points\n                                   \n\nadded for  such  conviction in  Chapter  Four, Part  A  (Criminal\n\nHistory).\"  U.S.S.G.   2L1.2, comment. (n.5) (emphasis supplied).\n\nAs a general rule,  courts should strive to apply  the guidelines\n\nas  written,  giving full  force  and  effect  to the  Sentencing\n\nCommission's interpretive commentary and application notes.   See\n                                                                 \n\nStinson  v. United States, 113  S. Ct. 1913,  1915 (1993); United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Jones,     F.2d    ,     (1st Cir. 1993)  [No. 93-1189,\n               \n\nslip op. at 6]; see also United States v. Williams, 954 F.2d 204,\n                                                  \n\n206  (4th Cir. 1992) (approving double counting on the basis that\n\nthe  sentencing   guidelines  must  be  \"applied   as  written\").\n\nAlthough  there are  exceptions to  the general rule,  see, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nStinson,  113 S. Ct. at  1915 (explaining that  commentary may be\n       \n\ndisregarded  if  \"it  violates  the  Constitution  or  a  federal\n\n                                4\n\nstatute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous  reading\n\nof,  [a] guideline\"); United States v. Fiore,  983 F.2d 1, 2 (1st\n                                            \n\nCir. 1992) (stating that courts \"should defer to the Commission's\n\nsuggested interpretation  of  a guideline  provision  unless  the\n\nCommission's  position  is arbitrary,  unreasonable, inconsistent\n\nwith the  guideline's text, or  contrary to law\"),  cert. denied,\n                                                                \n\n113  S.  Ct.  1830 (1993),  no  such  exception  applies in  this\n\ninstance.  To the contrary, note  5 strikes us as fully consonant\n\nwith constitutional  understandings, relevant statutory  law, and\n\nthe text of the applicable guideline provisions.\n\n          Furthermore, the case law offers  a ringing endorsement\n\nfor   the  district  court's  use  of   double  counting  in  the\n\ncircumstances  at hand.  Indeed, in United States v. Adeleke, 968\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 1159 (11th Cir. 1992), the Eleventh  Circuit flatly rejected\n\na  challenge virtually identical to that mounted by Zapata.3  The\n\nAdeleke court determined that  the Sentencing Commission intended\n       \n\na  prior felony  conviction to  be used  in calculating  both the\n\noffense level and the CHC  in a Title 8  case.  See id. at  1161.\n                                                       \n\nThe  court  found support  for this  conclusion  not only  in the\n\nCommission's interpretive commentary  but also in  the sentencing\n\n                    \n\n     3Adeleke involved an  alien found in the United States after\n             \nhe  had  been deported  following  an  earlier conviction  for  a\ngarden-variety  \"felony.\"    See  8  U.S.C.     1326(b)(1).    In\n                                \ncontrast, the  case before  us  involves 8  U.S.C.    1326(b)(2),\nwhich pertains  to an alien  convicted of an  \"aggravated felony\"\nprior  to  deportation.   Because  the  only material  difference\nconcerns the seriousness of the prior felony conviction, we think\nthat \"(b)(1)\" cases, like Adeleke, are relevant authority  when a\n                                 \ncourt ponders the permissibility of double counting in a \"(b)(2)\"\ncase.\n\n                                5\n\ncalculus itself.  In  this respect, the  court viewed the use  of\n\nthe  same conviction  for \"conceptually  separate notions\"  about\n\nsentencing  to  be  permissible,  explaining  that  the  criminal\n\nhistory adjustment is \"designed to punish likely recidivists more\n\nseverely, while the [offense level] enhancement . . . is designed\n\nto deter  aliens who have  been convicted  of a  felony from  re-\n\nentering the United States.\"  Id. (citation omitted).\n                                 \n\n          In  United States  v. Campbell, 967 F.2d  20, 22-23 (2d\n                                        \n\nCir. 1992), a case involving an alien convicted under the statute\n\nat issue  here but  sentenced  pursuant to  an earlier,  somewhat\n\ndifferent version of the  guidelines, the Second Circuit employed\n\na  similar rationale  to  sustain the  two-fold  use of  a  prior\n\nconviction.    The  district  court  double  counted  a  previous\n\naggravated felony conviction in calculating the offense level and\n\nCHC,  respectively, for  an  alien who,  like Zapata,  unlawfully\n\nreentered the  United States.  Id.  at 23.  The  court of appeals\n                                  \n\naffirmed,  noting that,  although the  prior conviction  had been\n\nused  twice in  constructing  the defendant's  sentence, the  two\n\nusages measured  different things:  on one  occasion, the offense\n\nlevel, which represents  the Sentencing Commission's  judgment as\n\nto the  wrongfulness of the  unlawful entry  under the  attendant\n\ncircumstances;  and  on  the  second  occasion,  the  CHC,  which\n\nestimates  the  likelihood  of  recidivism with  respect  to  the\n\nparticular alien who achieves the illegal reentry.  Id. at 24-25.\n                                                       \n\n          Adeleke  and  Campbell  mirror  the  analytic  approach\n                                \n\nadopted by  this court in  United States v.  Sanders, 982 F.2d  4\n                                                    \n\n                                6\n\n(1st Cir. 1992), cert.  denied, 61 U.S.L.W. 3818 (1993).   There,\n                              \n\nwe found double counting to  be permissible because the guideline\n\nin question plainly directed the court to use a single factor   a\n\nconviction for carrying a firearm in the course of a drug crime  \n\nin two different ways:  first,  to calculate the offense level of\n\nan armed career criminal, and second, to calculate the criminal's\n\nCHC.  See id. at 6.\n             \n\n          We see no reason to retreat from these principles or to\n\nskirt  their  application in  the  instant  case.   Congress  has\n\ndelegated  to  the  Sentencing   Commission  the  twin  tasks  of\n\ndetermining (1)  which factors should be  considered in punishing\n\nand  deterring  criminals,  and  (2)  the  methodology  by  which\n\npunishment-related and deterrence-related factors should be taken\n\ninto account in constructing a  particular sentence.  See  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. La Guardia, 902 F.2d 1010, 1015 (1st Cir. 1990).  In a\n                     \n\ncarefully calibrated scheme aimed  at producing sentencing ranges\n\nthat will differ  depending upon  the existence and  nature of  a\n\nprior felony conviction, section 2L1.2 expresses two things:  (1)\n\nthe Commission's determination that the incidence and  attributes\n\nof  a  prior felony  conviction should  be  weighed by  courts in\n\nsentencing  a  special  class   of  aliens  who  have  unlawfully\n\nreentered  the United  States, and  (2) the  Commission's related\n\ndecision  that  the methodology  best  suited  to achieving  both\n\npunishment and  deterrence is to consider the relevant aspects of\n\nsuch a conviction in  calculating not only the offense  level but\n\n                                7\n\nalso the CHC.4\n\n          We  have  said  enough   on  this  score.    Since  the\n\nsentencing scheme that the Commission has devised for the offense\n\nof conviction is plausible  as a whole and not  inconsistent with\n\nstatutory law  or constitutional precepts,  we cannot  substitute\n\nour judgment for that of the Commission.  This  means, of course,\n\nthat we can second-guess  neither the Commission's  determination\n\nthat the  offense of unlawful reentry  subsequent to perpetrating\n\nan  aggravated  felony  is  sufficiently more  serious  than  the\n\ncommission of the same offense while toting less weighty  baggage\n\nand,  thus,   warrants   greater  punishment,   nor  its   allied\n\ndetermination that an alien who, having been deported following a\n\nconviction  for  an aggravated  felony,  and  having exhibited  a\n\nwillingness  to flout our  laws again  by reentering  the country\n\nwithout permission, may be  more likely to commit serious  crimes\n\nthan  an  alien  who unlawfully  reenters  this  country with  no\n\ncriminal record  or  with  a  less  sullied  record,  and,  thus,\n\ndeserves a  sentence possessing  greater deterrent impact.   Cf.,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  id. at 1015 (explaining that, since the Commission is free\n          \n\nto  determine the  extent to  which substantial  assistance by  a\n\ndefendant  should warrant a downward departure  and to fashion an\n\n                    \n\n     4U.S.S.G.   2L1.2(a)  establishes a base offense  level of 8\nfor aliens unlawfully entering the United States.   The guideline\nprovides a  four-level increase  for  aliens previously  deported\nafter  conviction  for a  non-immigration-related, non-aggravated\nfelony, id. at   2L1.2(b)(1), and a sixteen-level increase if the\n           \nprevious conviction was for an  aggravated felony.  See id. at   \n                                                           \n2L1.2(b)(2).  Other aspects of the sentencing scheme, such as how\nit  treats misdemeanors, see id., comment. (n.1), are not germane\n                                \nfor present purposes and, therefore, need not be discussed.\n\n                                8\n\nimplementing methodology, it  is not for  the courts to  question\n\nthe  wisdom of rational choices  made by the  Commission in these\n\nrespects).\n\n          We hold,  therefore, that to the extent the same factor\n\nreflects both the seriousness of an offense and the likelihood of\n\na particular  defendant's recidivism, it may  be considered twice\n\nin  sentencing    for  the  separate purposes  of  punishment and\n\ndeterrence    so  long as  the Commission,  expressly or  by fair\n\nimplication, so directs.

Appellant bases  this\n\nargument  on the combined force of three items:  (1) the language\n\n                                9\n\nof  U.S.S.G.     4A1.2(a)(1)  (defining a  \"prior  sentence\"  for\n\npurposes of computing a defendant's criminal history score as any\n\nsentence \"for conduct not  part of the instant offense\");  (2) an\n\nintroductory  comment to  Chapter 3,  Part D,  of  the sentencing\n\nguidelines (discussing  the need  for grouping rules  \"to prevent\n\nmultiple   punishment   for   substantially   identical   offense\n\nconduct\");  and (3)  a multifaceted  analogy to  several specific\n\ninstances  in which the Commission, having employed an element of\n\nthe offense in fixing the base offense level, thereafter chose to\n\neschew  any double  counting.    See,  e.g., U.S.S.G.      3A1.1,\n                                           \n\ncomment.  (n.2)  (discussing  vulnerability  of  victim),  3A1.3,\n\ncomment.

(n.2)).\n\n          Placing three legs under  the asseverational stool does\n\nnot render it capable of bearing the load that appellant rests on\n\nit.  The first two arguments can be considered in tandem.  As the\n\ngovernment points  out, both  the definition of  \"prior sentence\"\n\nand  the caveat  to the  grouping rules  focus on the  problem of\n\npunishing a defendant twice for the same conduct.  By like token,\n                                                \n\nthe  concern  expressed  by  the  Sentencing  Commission  in  the\n\nintroductory comment  to Chapter 3,  Part D applies  to multiple-\n\ncount   indictments     a   situation  where,  prototypically,  a\n\ndefendant's  guilt  on several  counts  may  flow  from the  same\n\n                                10\n\nunderlying  conduct.   The  case  at  bar presents  a  materially\n\ndifferent set  of circumstances.   Although Zapata's  prior drug-\n\ntrafficking  conviction may  well  be an  element of  the offense\n\nstated by 8 U.S.C.    1326(b)(2),5 the conduct which  resulted in\n\nthat conviction is clearly separate and distinct from the conduct\n\nat issue here.  In other words, section 1326(b)(2) does not focus\n\non appellant's earlier behavior,  but on appellant's status  as a\n                                                           \n\npreviously   convicted  felon.     This   distinction  completely\n\nundermines appellant's  reliance both  on U.S.S.G.    4A2.1(a)(1)\n\nand  on  the introductory  comment to  the  grouping rules.   Cf.\n                                                                 \n\nUnited  States v.

The\n\ninstances  appellant  cites   as  examples   of  the   Sentencing\n\nCommission's policy against double counting simply do not support\n\nthe  suggested analogy.   Those instances,  like our  decision in\n\nPlaza-Garcia, 914 F.2d at 347, do no more than illustrate  that a\n            \n\ngiven  factor  is not  to be  considered  twice in  calculating a\n\ndefendant's offense level.   See,  e.g., Jones,      F.2d at     \n                                              \n\n                    \n\n     5At least one district  court has concluded that 8  U.S.C.  \n1326(a)  and (b)(2)  describe separate  and distinct  offenses so\nthat the government \"must allege, as an element of a violation of\n   1326(b)(2), the  existence of  a defendant's  prior aggravated\nfelony conviction.\"   United States v.  Vieira-Candelario, 811 F.\n                                                         \nSupp. 762, 768 (D.R.I. 1993).

But, such instances  are not particularly instructive in\n\nexamining  the  different question  of  whether  a single  factor\n\n(here, a prior conviction)  may be considered in connection  with\n\nboth  the  calculation of  a  defendant's offense  level  and the\n\ncalculation  of his CHC.   As we previously  indicated, see supra\n                                                                 \n\nPart  II, we believe that where the guidelines so provide, either\n\nexpressly  or  by fair  implication,  a single  factor  may serve\n\ndouble  duty  in that  fashion.    See Newman,  982  F.2d  at 673\n                                             \n\n(holding  that the  Commission's  express prohibition  of  double\n\ncounting  in certain  instances  indicates its  intent to  permit\n\ndouble counting  in other  instances); United States  v.

We conclude,  without serious\n\nquestion,  that double counting of the type employed here   using\n\na single factor to influence  both the defendant's offense  level\n\nand CHC   is permissible.   The double counting done in this case\n\nis,  moreover,  faithful  to   the  tenor  and  purport   of  the\n\nguidelines.

Concluding that Zapata's sentence was lawfully constituted, we affirm.I</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts relevant to this appeal are not disputed.  The government deported Zapata in 1990, following his conviction on a state drug-trafficking charge for which he served 142 days in prison (the remainder of his term of immurement having been suspended).  Under applicable federal law, Zapata's prior conviction is classified as an aggravated felony.  See 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1101(a)(43).  The deportation did not stick:  Zapata returned to the United States sub rosa in 1992.  Once apprehended, he pled guilty to a charge that he had violated 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(a) &amp; (b)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court calculated Zapata's offense level and criminal history category (CHC) in the manner directed by the federal sentencing guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The court started with a base offense level of eight, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2(a), increased the offense level to twenty-four, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2(b)(2) (directing a sixteen-level increase for a defendant who has entered the United States unlawfully following deportation \"after a conviction for an aggravated felony\"), and subtracted three levels for acceptance of responsibility, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1, thereby reaching an adjusted offense level of twenty-one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's calculation of Zapata's CHC lies at the heart of this appeal.  Under U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.1(b), two criminal history points are to be added \"for each prior sentence of imprisonment\" of sixty days or more.  The term \"prior sentence\" means \"any sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt, whether by guilty plea [or otherwise], for conduct not part of the instant offense.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2(a)(1).  The district court invoked this provision, adding two points to Zapata's criminal history score by reason of the prior narcotics conviction (notwithstanding that the prior conviction had already been used to ratchet up his offense level).  The two criminal history points boosted appellant over the line into CHC II and upped the GSR to 41-51 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court sentenced appellant to forty-one months in prison, this appeal arose.  In it, Zapata assigns error solely to the double counting of his original narcotics conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the sentencing context, double counting is a phenomenon that is less sinister than the name implies.  The practice is often perfectly proper.  This case illustrates the point:  the double counting in which the district court engaged did not stray into forbidden territory.  Rather, the court's methodology carefully tracked the Sentencing Commission's interpretive comment, which states specifically that an offense level increase for a prior felony conviction under section 2L1.2(b) \"applies in addition to any criminal history points added for such conviction in Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2, comment.  (n. 5) (emphasis supplied).  As a general rule, courts should strive to apply the guidelines as written, giving full force and effect to the Sentencing Commission's interpretive commentary and application notes.  See Stinson v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1915, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993);  United States v. Jones, 997 F.2d 967, 969 (1st Cir.1993);  see also United States v. Williams, 954 F.2d 204, 206 (4th Cir.1992) (approving double counting on the basis that the sentencing guidelines must be \"applied as written\").  Although there are exceptions to the general rule, see, e.g., Stinson, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1915 (explaining that commentary may be disregarded if \"it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, [a] guideline\");  United States v. Fiore, 983 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1992) (stating that courts \"should defer to the Commission's suggested interpretation of a guideline provision unless the Commission's position is arbitrary, unreasonable, inconsistent with the guideline's text, or contrary to law\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1830, 123 L.Ed.2d 458 (1993), no such exception applies in this instance.  To the contrary, note 5 strikes us as fully consonant with constitutional understandings, relevant statutory law, and the text of the applicable guideline provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the case law offers a ringing endorsement for the district court's use of double counting in the circumstances at hand.  Indeed, in United States v. Adeleke, 968 F.2d 1159 (11th Cir.1992), the Eleventh Circuit flatly rejected a challenge virtually identical to that mounted by Zapata.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The Adeleke court determined that the Sentencing Commission intended a prior felony conviction to be used in calculating both the offense level and the CHC in a Title 8 case.  See id. at 1161.   The court found support for this conclusion not only in the Commission's interpretive commentary but also in the sentencing calculus itself.  In this respect, the court viewed the use of the same conviction for \"conceptually separate notions\" about sentencing to be permissible, explaining that the criminal history adjustment is \"designed to punish likely recidivists more severely, while the [offense level] enhancement ... is designed to deter aliens who have been convicted of a felony from re-entering the United States.\"  Id. (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Campbell, 967 F.2d 20, 22-23 (2d Cir.1992), a case involving an alien convicted under the statute at issue here but sentenced pursuant to an earlier, somewhat different version of the guidelines, the Second Circuit employed a similar rationale to sustain the two-fold use of a prior conviction.  The district court double counted a previous aggravated felony conviction in calculating the offense level and CHC, respectively, for an alien who, like Zapata, unlawfully reentered the United States.  Id. at 23.   The court of appeals affirmed, noting that, although the prior conviction had been used twice in constructing the defendant's sentence, the two usages measured different things:  on one occasion, the offense level, which represents the Sentencing Commission's judgment as to the wrongfulness of the unlawful entry under the attendant circumstances;  and on the second occasion, the CHC, which estimates the likelihood of recidivism with respect to the particular alien who achieves the illegal reentry.  Id. at 24-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adeleke and Campbell mirror the analytic approach adopted by this court in United States v. Sanders, 982 F.2d 4 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2937, 124 L.Ed.2d 686 (1993).  There, we found double counting to be permissible because the guideline in question plainly directed the court to use a single factor--a conviction for carrying a firearm in the course of a drug crime--in two different ways:  first, to calculate the offense level of an armed career criminal, and second, to calculate the criminal's CHC.  See id. at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no reason to retreat from these principles or to skirt their application in the instant case.  Congress has delegated to the Sentencing Commission the twin tasks of determining (1) which factors should be considered in punishing and deterring criminals, and (2) the methodology by which punishment-related and deterrence-related factors should be taken into account in constructing a particular sentence.  See United States v. La Guardia, 902 F.2d 1010, 1015 (1st Cir.1990).  In a carefully calibrated scheme aimed at producing sentencing ranges that will differ depending upon the existence and nature of a prior felony conviction, section 2L1.2 expresses two things:  (1) the Commission's determination that the incidence and attributes of a prior felony conviction should be weighed by courts in sentencing a special class of aliens who have unlawfully reentered the United States, and (2) the Commission's related decision that the methodology best suited to achieving both punishment and deterrence is to consider the relevant aspects of such a conviction in calculating not only the offense level but also the CHC.<sup>4</sup></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said enough on this score.  Since the sentencing scheme that the Commission has devised for the offense of conviction is plausible as a whole and not inconsistent with statutory law or constitutional precepts, we cannot substitute our judgment for that of the Commission.  This means, of course, that we can second-guess neither the Commission's determination that the offense of unlawful reentry subsequent to perpetrating an aggravated felony is sufficiently more serious than the commission of the same offense while toting less weighty baggage and, thus, warrants greater punishment, nor its allied determination that an alien who, having been deported following a conviction for an aggravated felony, and having exhibited a willingness to flout our laws again by reentering the country without permission, may be more likely to commit serious crimes than an alien who unlawfully reenters this country with no criminal record or with a less sullied record, and, thus, deserves a sentence possessing greater deterrent impact.  Cf., e.g., id. at 1015 (explaining that, since the Commission is free to determine the extent to which substantial assistance by a defendant should warrant a downward departure and to fashion an implementing methodology, it is not for the courts to question the wisdom of rational choices made by the Commission in these respects).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that to the extent the same factor reflects both the seriousness of an offense and the likelihood of a particular defendant's recidivism, it may be considered twice in sentencing--for the separate purposes of punishment and deterrence--so long as the Commission, expressly or by fair implication, so directs.  Cf. United States v. Newman, 982 F.2d 665, 672-75 (1st Cir.1992) (holding double counting to be permissible in a situation where it was expressly authorized by the applicable guideline and helped to effectuate the Sentencing Commission's \"carefully calibrated offense level adjustment scheme\"), petition for cert. filed (U.S. Apr. 22, 1993).  Because the ruling below falls squarely within this ambit, we reject appellant's claim of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant has another string to his bow.  Citing United States v. Campos-Martinez, 976 F.2d 589 (9th Cir.1992), he asseverates that, because his prior felony conviction is an element of the crime to which he pled guilty, double counting conflicts with what he terms a \"clear policy of the Sentencing Commission to avoid double counting when the specific behavior is an element of the crime for which the defendant will be sentenced.\"   Appellant's Brief at 6.  Appellant bases this argument on the combined force of three items:  (1) the language of U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2(a)(1) (defining a \"prior sentence\" for purposes of computing a defendant's criminal history score as any sentence \"for conduct not part of the instant offense\");  (2) an introductory comment to Chapter 3, Part D, of the sentencing guidelines (discussing the need for grouping rules \"to prevent multiple punishment for substantially identical offense conduct\");  and (3) a multifaceted analogy to several specific instances in which the Commission, having employed an element of the offense in fixing the base offense level, thereafter chose to eschew any double counting.  See, e.g., U.S.S.G. Secs. 3A1.1, comment.  (n. 2) (discussing vulnerability of victim), 3A1.3, comment.  (n. 2) (discussing restraint of victim), 3B1.3 (discussing abuse of special trust), 3C1.1, comment.  (n. 6) (discussing obstruction of justice);  see also United States v. Plaza-Garcia, 914 F.2d 345 (1st Cir.1990) (applying Sec. 3A1.1, comment.  (n. 2)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Placing three legs under the asseverational stool does not render it capable of bearing the load that appellant rests on it.  The first two arguments can be considered in tandem.  As the government points out, both the definition of \"prior sentence\" and the caveat to the grouping rules focus on the problem of punishing a defendant twice for the same conduct.   By like token, the concern expressed by the Sentencing Commission in the introductory comment to Chapter 3, Part D applies to multiple-count indictments--a situation where, prototypically, a defendant's guilt on several counts may flow from the same underlying conduct.  The case at bar presents a materially different set of circumstances.  Although Zapata's prior drug-trafficking conviction may well be an element of the offense stated by 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(2),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the conduct which resulted in that conviction is clearly separate and distinct from the conduct at issue here.  In other words, section 1326(b)(2) does not focus on appellant's earlier behavior, but on appellant's status as a previously convicted felon.  This distinction completely undermines appellant's reliance both on U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2(a)(1) and on the introductory comment to the grouping rules.  Cf. United States v. Alessandroni, 982 F.2d 419, 421, 422 (10th Cir.1992) (upholding, against a similar challenge premised on Sec. 4A1.2(a)(1), the district court's consideration of a prior burglary conviction in calculating both the base offense level and the CHC applicable to a pending felon-in-possession count).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third leg of the stool is no more sturdy.  The instances appellant cites as examples of the Sentencing Commission's policy against double counting simply do not support the suggested analogy.  Those instances, like our decision in Plaza-Garcia, 914 F.2d at 347, do no more than illustrate that a given factor is not to be considered twice in calculating a defendant's offense level.  See, e.g., Jones, 997 F.2d at 969 (distinguishing Plaza-Garcia on this basis).  For purposes of this case, we accept the premise that a single factor cannot be double counted in setting a defendant's offense level.  But, such instances are not particularly instructive in examining the different question of whether a single factor (here, a prior conviction) may be considered in connection with both the calculation of a defendant's offense level and the calculation of his CHC.  As we previously indicated, see supra Part II, we believe that where the guidelines so provide, either expressly or by fair implication, a single factor may serve double duty in that fashion.  See Newman, 982 F.2d at 673 (holding that the Commission's express prohibition of double counting in certain instances indicates its intent to permit double counting in other instances);  United States v. Blakney, 941 F.2d 114, 117 (2d Cir.1991) (allowing consideration of defendant's prior conviction in connection with both offense level and CHC calculations where the guidelines did not provide to the contrary and the general purposes underlying each usage differed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  We conclude, without serious question, that double counting of the type employed here--using a single factor to influence both the defendant's offense level and CHC--is permissible.  The double counting done in this case is, moreover, faithful to the tenor and purport of the guidelines.  It follows that the lower court sentenced appellant in a lawful manner.  The judgment below is, therefore, summarily affirmed.

Concluding that Zapata's sentence was lawfully constituted, we affirm.I</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts relevant to this appeal are not disputed.  The government deported Zapata in 1990, following his conviction on a state drug-trafficking charge for which he served 142 days in prison (the remainder of his term of immurement having been suspended).  Under applicable federal law, Zapata's prior conviction is classified as an aggravated felony.  See 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1101(a)(43).  The deportation did not stick:  Zapata returned to the United States sub rosa in 1992.  Once apprehended, he pled guilty to a charge that he had violated 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(a) &amp; (b)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court calculated Zapata's offense level and criminal history category (CHC) in the manner directed by the federal sentencing guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The court started with a base offense level of eight, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2(a), increased the offense level to twenty-four, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2(b)(2) (directing a sixteen-level increase for a defendant who has entered the United States unlawfully following deportation \"after a conviction for an aggravated felony\"), and subtracted three levels for acceptance of responsibility, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1, thereby reaching an adjusted offense level of twenty-one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's calculation of Zapata's CHC lies at the heart of this appeal.  Under U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.1(b), two criminal history points are to be added \"for each prior sentence of imprisonment\" of sixty days or more.  The term \"prior sentence\" means \"any sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt, whether by guilty plea [or otherwise], for conduct not part of the instant offense.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2(a)(1).  The district court invoked this provision, adding two points to Zapata's criminal history score by reason of the prior narcotics conviction (notwithstanding that the prior conviction had already been used to ratchet up his offense level).  The two criminal history points boosted appellant over the line into CHC II and upped the GSR to 41-51 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court sentenced appellant to forty-one months in prison, this appeal arose.  In it, Zapata assigns error solely to the double counting of his original narcotics conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the sentencing context, double counting is a phenomenon that is less sinister than the name implies.  The practice is often perfectly proper.  This case illustrates the point:  the double counting in which the district court engaged did not stray into forbidden territory.  Rather, the court's methodology carefully tracked the Sentencing Commission's interpretive comment, which states specifically that an offense level increase for a prior felony conviction under section 2L1.2(b) \"applies in addition to any criminal history points added for such conviction in Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2, comment.  (n. 5) (emphasis supplied).  As a general rule, courts should strive to apply the guidelines as written, giving full force and effect to the Sentencing Commission's interpretive commentary and application notes.  See Stinson v.

In this respect, the court viewed the use of the same conviction for \"conceptually separate notions\" about sentencing to be permissible, explaining that the criminal history adjustment is \"designed to punish likely recidivists more severely, while the [offense level] enhancement ... is designed to deter aliens who have been convicted of a felony from re-entering the United States.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586442\"><a href=\"/opinion/586442/united-states-v-paul-godwin-adeleke/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (citation omitted).</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v.

The district court double counted a previous aggravated felony conviction in calculating the offense level and CHC, respectively, for an alien who, like Zapata, unlawfully reentered the United States.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585218\"><a href=\"/opinion/585218/united-states-v-david-e-campbell-also-known-as-anthony-jarrett-alton/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 23. </a></span>  The court of appeals affirmed, noting that, although the prior conviction had been used twice in constructing the defendant's sentence, the two usages measured different things:  on one occasion, the offense level, which represents the Sentencing Commission's judgment as to the wrongfulness of the unlawful entry under the attendant circumstances;  and on the second occasion, the CHC, which estimates the likelihood of recidivism with respect to the particular alien who achieves the illegal reentry.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585218\"><a href=\"/opinion/585218/united-states-v-david-e-campbell-also-known-as-anthony-jarrett-alton/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 24-25.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adeleke and Campbell mirror the analytic approach adopted by this court in United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span> </span>(1993).  There, we found double counting to be permissible because the guideline in question plainly directed the court to use a single factor--a conviction for carrying a firearm in the course of a drug crime--in two different ways:  first, to calculate the offense level of an armed career criminal, and second, to calculate the criminal's CHC.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 6.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no reason to retreat from these principles or to skirt their application in the instant case.  Congress has delegated to the Sentencing Commission the twin tasks of determining (1) which factors should be considered in punishing and deterring criminals, and (2) the methodology by which punishment-related and deterrence-related factors should be taken into account in constructing a particular sentence.  See United States v. La Guardia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541060\"><a href=\"/opinion/541060/united-states-v-julio-la-guardia-united-states-of-america-v-eredia/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1010</span></a></span>, 1015 (1st Cir.1990).  In a carefully calibrated scheme aimed at producing sentencing ranges that will differ depending upon the existence and nature of a prior felony conviction, section 2L1.2 expresses two things:  (1) the Commission's determination that the incidence and attributes of a prior felony conviction should be weighed by courts in sentencing a special class of aliens who have unlawfully reentered the United States, and (2) the Commission's related decision that the methodology best suited to achieving both punishment and deterrence is to consider the relevant aspects of such a conviction in calculating not only the offense level but also the CHC.<sup>4</sup></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said enough on this score.  Since the sentencing scheme that the Commission has devised for the offense of conviction is plausible as a whole and not inconsistent with statutory law or constitutional precepts, we cannot substitute our judgment for that of the Commission.  This means, of course, that we can second-guess neither the Commission's determination that the offense of unlawful reentry subsequent to perpetrating an aggravated felony is sufficiently more serious than the commission of the same offense while toting less weighty baggage and, thus, warrants greater punishment, nor its allied determination that an alien who, having been deported following a conviction for an aggravated felony, and having exhibited a willingness to flout our laws again by reentering the country without permission, may be more likely to commit serious crimes than an alien who unlawfully reenters this country with no criminal record or with a less sullied record, and, thus, deserves a sentence possessing greater deterrent impact.  Cf., e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541060\"><a href=\"/opinion/541060/united-states-v-julio-la-guardia-united-states-of-america-v-eredia/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1015 </a></span>(explaining that, since the Commission is free to determine the extent to which substantial assistance by a defendant should warrant a downward departure and to fashion an implementing methodology, it is not for the courts to question the wisdom of rational choices made by the Commission in these respects).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that to the extent the same factor reflects both the seriousness of an offense and the likelihood of a particular defendant's recidivism, it may be considered twice in sentencing--for the separate purposes of punishment and deterrence--so long as the Commission, expressly or by fair implication, so directs.  Cf. United States v. Newman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597414\"><a href=\"/opinion/597414/united-states-v-michael-j-newman/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">665</span></a></span>, 672-75 (1st Cir.1992) (holding double counting to be permissible in a situation where it was expressly authorized by the applicable guideline and helped to effectuate the Sentencing Commission's \"carefully calibrated offense level adjustment scheme\"), petition for cert. filed (U.S. Apr. 22, 1993).

Campos-Martinez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591469\"><a href=\"/opinion/591469/united-states-v-carlos-campos-martinez-aka-carlos-martinez-campos/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span> </a></span>(9th Cir.1992), he asseverates that, because his prior felony conviction is an element of the crime to which he pled guilty, double counting conflicts with what he terms a \"clear policy of the Sentencing Commission to avoid double counting when the specific behavior is an element of the crime for which the defendant will be sentenced.\"   Appellant's Brief at 6.  Appellant bases this argument on the combined force of three items:  (1) the language of U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2(a)(1) (defining a \"prior sentence\" for purposes of computing a defendant's criminal history score as any sentence \"for conduct not part of the instant offense\");  (2) an introductory comment to Chapter 3, Part D, of the sentencing guidelines (discussing the need for grouping rules \"to prevent multiple punishment for substantially identical offense conduct\");  and (3) a multifaceted analogy to several specific instances in which the Commission, having employed an element of the offense in fixing the base offense level, thereafter chose to eschew any double counting.  See, e.g., U.S.S.G. Secs. 3A1.1, comment.  (n. 2) (discussing vulnerability of victim), 3A1.3, comment.  (n. 2) (discussing restraint of victim), 3B1.3 (discussing abuse of special trust), 3C1.1, comment.  (n. 6) (discussing obstruction of justice);  see also United States v. Plaza-Garcia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548348\"><a href=\"/opinion/548348/united-states-v-luis-plaza-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1990) (applying Sec. 3A1.1, comment.

The first two arguments can be considered in tandem.  As the government points out, both the definition of \"prior sentence\" and the caveat to the grouping rules focus on the problem of punishing a defendant twice for the same conduct.   By like token, the concern expressed by the Sentencing Commission in the introductory comment to Chapter 3, Part D applies to multiple-count indictments--a situation where, prototypically, a defendant's guilt on several counts may flow from the same underlying conduct.  The case at bar presents a materially different set of circumstances.  Although Zapata's prior drug-trafficking conviction may well be an element of the offense stated by 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(2),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the conduct which resulted in that conviction is clearly separate and distinct from the conduct at issue here.  In other words, section 1326(b)(2) does not focus on appellant's earlier behavior, but on appellant's status as a previously convicted felon.  This distinction completely undermines appellant's reliance both on U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2(a)(1) and on the introductory comment to the grouping rules.  Cf. United States v.

The instances appellant cites as examples of the Sentencing Commission's policy against double counting simply do not support the suggested analogy.  Those instances, like our decision in <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548348\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Plaza-Garcia,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/548348/united-states-v-luis-plaza-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span>, do no more than illustrate that a given factor is not to be considered twice in calculating a defendant's offense level.  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610802\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Jones,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/610802/united-states-v-eric-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">969</span> </a></span>(distinguishing Plaza-Garcia on this basis).  For purposes of this case, we accept the premise that a single factor cannot be double counted in setting a defendant's offense level.  But, such instances are not particularly instructive in examining the different question of whether a single factor (here, a prior conviction) may be considered in connection with both the calculation of a defendant's offense level and the calculation of his CHC.  As we previously indicated, see supra Part II, we believe that where the guidelines so provide, either expressly or by fair implication, a single factor may serve double duty in that fashion.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597414\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Newman,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/597414/united-states-v-michael-j-newman/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">673</span> </a></span>(holding that the Commission's express prohibition of double counting in certain instances indicates its intent to permit double counting in other instances);  United States v. Blakney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566315\"><a href=\"/opinion/566315/united-states-v-jack-blakney/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">114</span></a></span>, 117 (2d Cir.1991) (allowing consideration of defendant's prior conviction in connection with both offense level and CHC calculations where the guidelines did not provide to the contrary and the general purposes underlying each usage differed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  We conclude, without serious question, that double counting of the type employed here--using a single factor to influence both the defendant's offense level and CHC--is permissible.  The double counting done in this case is, moreover, faithful to the tenor and purport of the guidelines.  It follows that the lower court sentenced appellant in a lawful manner.  The judgment below is, therefore, summarily affirmed.  See 1st Cir.Loc.R. 27.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> These subsections stipulate in the aggregate that any \"alien who ... has been arrested and deported ..., and thereafter ... is ... found in ... the United States [without the express consent of the Attorney General, and] ... whose deportation was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony, ... shall be [punished as provided].\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> As a matter of general interest, we note that Zapata was sentenced on December 1, 1992;  hence, the November, 1992 version of the guidelines applied.  See United States v. Harotunian, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552769\"><a href=\"/opinion/552769/united-states-v-dennis-harotunian/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span>, 1041-42 (1st Cir.1990) (directing that, except where necessary to avoid ex post facto problems, \"a defendant is to be punished in accordance with the guidelines in effect at sentencing\").  Although the district court signalled an intention to use the November, 1991 version of the guidelines, this appears to have been a slip of the tongue.  Because the district court's calculations faithfully track the November, 1992 version, we disregard the lapsus linguae</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Adeleke involved an alien found in the United States after he had been deported following an earlier conviction for a garden-variety \"felony.\"   See 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(1).  In contrast, the case before us involves 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(2), which pertains to an alien convicted of an \"aggravated felony\" prior to deportation.  Because the only material difference concerns the seriousness of the prior felony conviction, we think that \"(b)(1)\" cases, like Adeleke, are relevant authority when a court ponders the permissibility of double counting in a \"(b)(2)\" case</p>\n        <p>4 U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2(a) establishes a base offense level of 8 for aliens unlawfully entering the United States.  The guideline provides a four-level increase for aliens previously deported after conviction for a non-immigration-related, non-aggravated felony, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552769\"><a href=\"/opinion/552769/united-states-v-dennis-harotunian/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at Sec. </a></span>2L1.2(b)(1), and a sixteen-level increase if the previous conviction was for an aggravated felony.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552769\"><a href=\"/opinion/552769/united-states-v-dennis-harotunian/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at Sec. </a></span>2L1.2(b)(2).
