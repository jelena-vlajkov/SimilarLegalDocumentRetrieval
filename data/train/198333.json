This appeal involves an action\r\nfiled by plaintiff-appellant Paula Tardie against her employer, the\r\nRehabilitation Hospital of Rhode Island (\"RHRI\"), and its parent\r\norganization, the Braintree Hospital Rehabilitation Network\r\n(\"Braintree\") (collectively, \"appellees\").  Tardie alleges that she\r\nwas discharged from her position as Director of Human Resources at\r\nRHRI due to her disability and while she was on medical leave.  On\r\nMay 29, 1998, the district court entered summary judgment against\r\nTardie's claims.  Tardie appeals, and we affirm.\r\n                          BACKGROUND\r\nIn January of 1990, Tardie began working as a personnel\r\nassistant in the Human Resources Department at Braintree.  Tardie\r\nsubsequently received several promotions, and in late 1993, Tardie\r\nwas selected by her supervisor, Richard Horne, to establish the\r\nHuman Resources Department at the newly-formed RHRI.  One of\r\nTardie's tasks in setting up the department was drafting the job\r\ndescription of the Director of Human Resources at RHRI.  That job\r\ndescription gave a summary of the position and outlined the\r\nessential qualifications, requirements, and functions of the\r\nposition.  One of the listed requirements was \"ABILITY TO MAINTAIN\r\nASSIGNED WORK HOURS:  Has sufficient endurance to perform tasks\r\nover long periods of time.\" \r\nIn January of 1994, Tardie was appointed as Director of\r\nHuman Resources at RHRI.  In this position, Tardie earned a salary\r\nof approximately $50,000 per year and worked \"anywhere from 50 to\r\n70 hours per week.\"  In July of 1994, Tardie began to experience\r\nchest pain, shortness of breath, numbness in her arms, and\r\ndizziness.  Tardie's doctor conducted tests on her heart and found\r\nresults consistent with a left atrial enlargement.  Tardie was then\r\nplaced on medical leave of absence from July 26 through\r\nSeptember 6, 1994.  Horne, who was still Tardie's supervisor,\r\ncalled Tardie, and Tardie told him that she believed that working\r\nexcessive hours was causing the symptoms.  Horne offered to return\r\nTardie to her former position at Braintree, and Tardie accepted the\r\noffer.  Tardie wrote a \"thank you\" note to Horne, thanking him for\r\nall he had done for her, apologizing that she \"couldn't do it,\" and\r\nstating that she \"gave it [her] best.\"  Tardie testified in her\r\ndeposition that, by \"it,\" she meant the long hours of the position.\r\nOn August 16, 1995, Horne and Tardie met to discuss the\r\nstatus of her employment.  Horne stated that there were no\r\navailable positions at RHRI, but that he would create a part-time\r\nposition as a recruiter at Braintree if Tardie was interested.\r\nOtherwise, Horne offered to assist her in obtaining a severance\r\npackage from RHRI and finding employment with another company. \r\nRather than resign or allow Horne to create the part-time position,\r\nTardie called Donald Burman, the Chief Executive Officer of RHRI,\r\nand told him that she intended to return to RHRI.  She stated that\r\nshe would gradually increase her working hours to a maximum of\r\nforty hours per week, but that she could no longer work the\r\nextended hours she had been working.  Burman agreed and stated that\r\nthey could work it out.  Tardie then called Horne, who told her\r\nthat he could justify adding a part-time person to assist Tardie\r\nand that he would present this idea to Burman.\r\nHorne, Burman and Lisa LaDew, Chief Operating Officer at\r\nRHRI, then met to discuss Tardie's situation.  Tardie alleges that\r\nHorne, Burman and LaDew discussed her medical condition and assumed\r\nthat she suffered from an enlarged heart.  The three individuals\r\ndecided not to reinstate Tardie as Human Resources Director because\r\nthey determined that Tardie could not perform the job while working\r\nonly forty hours per week.  Horne called Tardie to inform her of\r\nthe decision and told her that she needed to discuss the matter\r\nwith Burman.  Burman later explained to Tardie the basis for the\r\ndecision and offered to put together a severance package for her. \r\nA package was later offered, but Tardie refused to accept it. \r\nOn November 27, 1996, Tardie filed a complaint against\r\nRHRI and Braintree in United States District Court for the District\r\nof Rhode Island.  Tardie alleged that her discharge violated:\r\n(1) the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"Rehabilitation Act\"), 29\r\nU.S.C.  791 et seq.; (2) the Americans with Disabilities Act of\r\n1990 (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C.  12101 et seq.; (3) the Family and Medical\r\nLeave Act of 1993 (\"FMLA\"), 29 U.S.C.  2601 et seq.; (4) the Rhode\r\nIsland Civil Rights of Individuals with Handicaps Act (\"RICRIHA\"),\r\nR.I. Gen. Laws  42-87-1 et seq.; (5) the Rhode Island Fair\r\nEmployment Practices Act (\"FEPA\"), R.I. Gen. Laws  28-5-1 et seq.;\r\nand (6) the Rhode Island Parental and Family Medical Leave Act\r\n(\"PFMLA\"), R.I. Gen. Laws  28-48-1 et seq.   After the close of\r\ndiscovery, appellees moved for summary judgment on all counts.  The\r\ndistrict court granted appellees' motion, finding: (1) that Tardie\r\nwas unable to demonstrate that she suffered from a \"disability\" or\r\nwas perceived as suffering from a \"disability\" under the ADA or\r\nRehabilitation Act, and (2) that Tardie was unable to work fifty to\r\nseventy hours per week, which was one of the essential functions of\r\nher position.  The district court entered judgment against all of\r\nTardie's claims on May 28, 1998, and this timely appeal followed.\r\n                          DISCUSSION\r\nTardie argues that the district court erred in entering\r\nsummary judgment against her six causes of action.  Summary\r\njudgment is proper where \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits,\r\nif any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\r\nand that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  Once the moving party has pointed to\r\nthe absence of adequate evidence supporting the nonmoving party's\r\ncase, the onus is on the nonmoving party to present facts that show\r\na genuine issue for trial.  See Serrano-Cruz v. DFI Puerto Rico,\r\nInc., 109 F.3d 23, 25 (1st Cir. 1997); LeBlanc v. Great American\r\nIns. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 841-42 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 511\r\nU.S. 1018 (1994).  \"[A] party opposing a properly supported motion\r\nfor summary judgment may not rest upon mere allegation or denials\r\nof his pleading, but must set forth specific facts showing that\r\nthere is a genuine issue for trial.\"  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\r\nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 256 (1986)(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).\r\n\"[P]laintiff . . . [must] offer[] . . . 'significant probative\r\nevidence tending to support the complaint.'\"  Id. at 256 (quoting\r\nfrom First National Bank of Arizona v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S.\r\n253, 290 (1968)).  We review the district court's grant of summary\r\njudgment de novo.  See Serrano-Cruz, 109 F.3d at 25.\r\nA.  The Americans With Disabilities Act\r\nTo prove her ADA claim, Tardie must establish: (1) that\r\nshe suffered from a \"disability\" within the meaning of the ADA;\r\n(2) that she was able to perform the essential functions of her\r\njob, either with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) that\r\nher employer discharged her in whole or in part because of that\r\ndisability.  See Feliciano v. State of Rhode Island, 160 F.3d 780,\r\n784 (1st Cir. 1998) (citing Katz v. City Metal Co., Inc., 87 F.3d\r\n26, 30 (1st Cir. 1996)).  The district court found that it did not\r\nneed to reach the second or third elements because Tardie could not\r\nestablish that she had or has a disability as defined by the ADA.\r\nThe regulations governing the ADA define \"disability\" as:\r\n(A) having a physical or mental impairment which substantially\r\nlimits one or more of an individual's major life activities;\r\n(B) having a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as\r\nhaving such an impairment.  See 42 U.S.C.  12102(2);  29 C.F.R.\r\n1630.2(g).  The district court rejected Tardie's arguments that\r\nshe had a \"disability\" under subsections (2)(A) and (2)(C).  On\r\nappeal, Tardie argues only that she was disabled under subsection\r\n(2)(C), or that appellees regarded her as having a substantially\r\nlimiting impairment.  An individual who has an impairment that is\r\nnot substantially limiting (or has no impairment at all) is\r\nnevertheless \"disabled\" if she is treated by her employer as having\r\nan impairment that does substantially limit major life activities.\r\nSee 29 C.F.R.  1630.2(l); Katz, 87 F.3d at 32.\r\nTardie argues that there is ample evidence that appellees\r\nregarded her as suffering from an impairment.  Tardie claims that\r\nappellees demonstrated their perception of her as disabled at the\r\nmeeting between Horne, Burman, and LaDew.  Tardie claims that the\r\ndecision to discharge her was based upon appellees' misperception\r\nthat she suffered from a heart condition which rendered her unable\r\nto perform her job, either with or without reasonable\r\naccommodation.\r\nTardie has clearly demonstrated that appellees regarded\r\nher as having an impairment that prevented her from working more\r\nthan forty hours per week; Tardie specifically told them as much. \r\nThe question becomes whether such an impairment is an impairment\r\nthat \"substantially limits\" one of Tardie's \"major life\r\nactivities\".  See 42 U.S.C.  12102(2); 29 C.F.R.  1630.2(g).  As \r\nnoted by the district court, working is a major life activity, but\r\nthe perceived impairment is not one that substantially limits the\r\nactivity of working.  The relevant regulation defines\r\n\"substantially limits,\" in the context of the activity of working,\r\nas:\r\nsignificantly restricted in the ability to\r\nperform either a class of jobs or a broad\r\nrange of jobs in various classes as compared\r\nto the average person having comparable\r\ntraining, skills and abilities.  The inability\r\nto perform a single, particular job does not\r\nconstitute a substantial limitation in the\r\nmajor life activity of working.\r\n\n29 C.F.R.  1630.2(j)(3).  Hence, the fact that appellees may have\r\nregarded Tardie as unable to work more than 40 hours per week, and\r\nthereby unable to perform her particular job, does not mean that\r\nappellees regarded her as being substantially limited in the major\r\nlife activity of working.  \"An impairment that disqualifies a\r\nperson from only a narrow range of jobs is not considered a\r\nsubstantially limiting one.\"  Heilweil v. Mount Sinai Hosp., 32\r\nF.3d 718, 723 (2d Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1147 (1995);\r\nsee also McKay v. Toyota Mfg., U.S.A., Inc., 110 F.3d 369, 373 (6th\r\nCir. 1997) (citing Heilweil and finding that the plaintiff's\r\ninability to perform repetitive-motion factory work did not\r\nrestrict her ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad\r\nrange of jobs); Wooten v. Farmland Foods, 58 F.3d 382, 386 (8th\r\nCir. 1995) (citing Heilweil).  As the district court noted, there\r\nare vast employment opportunities available which require only 40-\r\nhour work weeks.  Without more, we cannot ascribe error to the\r\ndistrict court's finding that appellees regarded Tardie as having\r\nan impairment that did not substantially limit one or more of her\r\nmajor life activities.  Therefore, we affirm the district court's\r\ngrant of summary judgment against Tardie's ADA claim for failure to\r\ndemonstrate that she suffered from a disability.\r\nB.  The Rehabilitation Act\r\nSection 504(a) of the Rehabilitation Act provides that\r\n\"[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall,\r\nsolely by reason of her or his disability . . . be subjected to\r\ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal\r\nfinancial assistance.\"  29 U.S.C.  794(a).  In any claim under the\r\nRehabilitation Act, the plaintiff must first establish that she has\r\na disability covered by the Act.  See Leary v. Dalton, 58 F.3d 748, \r\n752 (1st Cir. 1995).  As discussed above, Tardie has not raised a\r\ngenuine issue with regard to whether she has a \"disability\" under\r\nthe ADA.  \"Disability\" is defined identically under the ADA and the\r\nRehabilitation Act. Compare 42 U.S.C.  12102(2)(statutory\r\ndefinition of ADA's \"disability\") and 29 C.F.R.  1630.2(g)\r\n(regulatory definition of ADA's \"disability\") with 29 U.S.C.\r\n705(20) (statutory definition of Rehabilitation Act's \"individual\r\nwith a disability\") and 29 C.F.R.  1614.203(a)(1) (regulatory\r\ndefinition of Rehabilitation Act's \"individual with handicaps\").\r\n   While the ADA's definition of \"substantially limits\"\r\nunder 29 C.F.R.  1630.2(j)(3) does not appear to have a\r\ncounterpart in the Rehabilitation Act or its regulations, Congress\r\nhas provided that the standards used to determine whether  504 of\r\nthe Rehabilitation Act has been violated in a complaint alleging\r\nemployment discrimination shall be the standards applied to\r\nemployment discrimination actions under the ADA, see 29 U.S.C.\r\n794(d).  Additionally, several courts have held, in the\r\nRehabilitation Act context, that the inability to perform a\r\nparticular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the\r\nmajor life activity of working.  See, e.g., Heilweil, 32 F.3d at\r\n723-24 (collecting cases for the proposition and finding that the\r\nplaintiff's inability to work in one particular place did not\r\nconstitute a disability); Gupton v. Virginia, 14 F.3d 203, 205 (4th\r\nCir.) (finding that a plaintiff did not demonstrate that an\r\nimpairment limited her ability to work when she presented only\r\nevidence that it prevented her from performing one particular job),\r\ncert. denied, 513 U.S. 810 (1994); Byrne v. Board of Educ., 979\r\nF.2d 560, 565 (7th Cir. 1992) (stating that it is well-established\r\nthat a person's inability to perform a specific job for a specific\r\nemployer does not substantially limit that person's ability to\r\nwork); Welsh v. City of Tulsa, 977 F.2d 1415, 1417-18 (10th Cir.\r\n1992) (holding that an impairment that an employer perceives as\r\nlimiting an individual's ability to perform only one job is not a\r\nhandicap under the Rehabilitation Act);  Maulding v. Sullivan, 961\r\nF.2d 694, 698 (8th Cir. 1992)(finding no error in the district\r\ncourt's conclusion that the inability to perform lab work does not\r\nsubstantially limit employment as a whole), cert. denied, 507 U.S.\r\n910 (1993).  Therefore, the district court properly granted summary\r\njudgment against Tardie's Rehabilitation Act claim for the same\r\nreason her ADA claim fails: she has not shown that appellees\r\nregarded her as having an impairment which substantially limits a\r\nmajor life activity.\r\nC.  The Family and Medical Leave Act\r\n   Tardie also claims that her termination while she was on\r\nmedical leave violated the FMLA.   An eligible employee who takes\r\nleave under the FMLA is entitled to be restored to the same or an\r\nequivalent position upon returning from leave.  See 29 U.S.C.\r\n2614(a)(1); Hodgens v. General Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 159\r\n(1st Cir. 1998) (citing 29 U.S.C.  2614(a)(1) and 29 C.F.R.\r\n825.100(c)).  However, the regulations promulgated under the FMLA\r\nstate that \"[i]f the employee is unable to perform an essential\r\nfunction of the position because of a physical or mental condition\r\n. . . the employee has no right to restoration to another position\r\nunder the FMLA.\"  29 C.F.R.  825.214(b).  The regulation then goes\r\non to state that the employer in such a situation may have\r\nobligations under the ADA.  See id.  \r\n   In analyzing Tardie's FMLA claim under  825.214(b), the\r\ndistrict court found: (1) that the position of Human Resources\r\nDirector at RHRI requires the employee to work fifty to seventy\r\nhours per week, and (2) that the ability to work extended hours was\r\nan essential function of the position.  Because Tardie cannot work\r\nmore than forty hours per week, the district court found that\r\nTardie could not perform an essential function of the position, and\r\ntherefore had no right to reinstatement.  Tardie raises several\r\narguments challenging this finding.\r\n   First, Tardie claims that the evidence does not support\r\na finding that an essential function of her job was working more\r\nthan 40 hours per week.  She points to the job description of the\r\nDirector of Human Resources position -- which she wrote -- and\r\nnotes that it does not set forth the ability to work sixty- to\r\nseventy-hour weeks as an essential function of the position. \r\nHowever, that job description does state that the person holding\r\nthe position must have \"sufficient endurance to perform tasks over\r\nlong periods of time.\"  Also, Tardie herself testified in her\r\ndeposition that: (1) dealing with employee issues beyond the hours\r\nof 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. was \"part of the job\"; (2) she frequently\r\nneeded to be present at the hospital for at least a portion of all\r\nthree of the hospital's eight-hour work shifts; (3) the position\r\noften required her to return to work after she had gone home for\r\nthe evening; and (4) she worked \"anywhere from 50 to 70 [hours per\r\nweek] depending on what [she] was doing.\"  The only evidence Tardie\r\noffers to support a finding that working extended hours was not an\r\nessential function of the position was a payroll check stub that\r\nstated that Tardie's salary was based upon a 40-hour week. \r\nHowever, even overlooking the fact that this payroll documentation\r\nwas created by an outside accounting organization, this evidence\r\ndoes not support Tardie's position.  Tardie was a salaried employee\r\nwho was not required to keep track of the hours she worked.  The\r\nfact that she was attributed a 40-hour work week for payroll\r\npurposes hardly demonstrates that only 40-hour work weeks were\r\nrequired of her in the actual performance of her position.\r\n   At oral argument, Tardie's counsel argued that the time\r\nspent at a job is not a \"function\" of the job; it is a capability. \r\nTardie claims that only specific duties can be \"functions\" of a\r\nposition.  Tardie attempts to distinguish her position's extended-\r\nhours requirement from the essential functions involved in\r\nFeliciano, 160 F.3d at 785 (lifting patients), and Laurin v.\r\nProvidence Hospital and Massachusetts Nurses Assoc., 150 F.3d 52,\r\n57 (1st Cir. 1998) (working the night shift).  Tardie describes\r\nlifting patients and working the night shift as \"specific duties\"\r\nand describes the hours worked as a \"capability.\"  Tardie cites no\r\nauthority for this distinction, and we believe it to be mere\r\nsemantics.  It strains credulity to argue that the time of day that\r\nthe hours are required to be worked can constitute an essential\r\nfunction but that the number of hours required to be worked cannot. \r\nAt bottom, Tardie offers no evidence that she or anyone else could\r\nperform the job in only forty hours per week and offers no evidence\r\nto rebut appellees' evidence that the extended-hours requirement is\r\nan essential function of the position.  Consequently, the district\r\ncourt did not err in finding that working more than 40 hours per\r\nweek was an essential function of the position.\r\n   Lastly, Tardie argues that, even if she were unable to\r\nperform the essential functions of her job, appellees were still\r\nrequired to offer her the same or equivalent position with\r\nreasonable accommodations.  Tardie claims that she has at least\r\nraised a genuine issue with regard to whether her request to work\r\nonly a 40-hour week was a reasonable accommodation.  We disagree. \r\nFirst of all, it is not at all clear that the concept of\r\n\"reasonable accommodation\" is applicable in the FMLA context. \r\nSection 825.214(b) eliminates the obligation to reinstate an\r\nemployee returning from FMLA leave if that employee is \"unable to\r\nperform an essential function of the position.\"  29 C.F.R.\r\n825.214(b).  Unlike the ADA, this FMLA regulation omits the\r\nqualifying \"with or without reasonable accommodation\" language. \r\nThe regulation goes on to state that the employer may have\r\nobligations under the ADA, but this reminder does not import the\r\n\"reasonable accommodation\" qualifier into the FMLA context.\r\n   Additionally, even if the \"reasonable accommodation\"\r\nlanguage did apply to this exception to the FMLA reinstatement\r\nrequirement, the accommodation sought by Tardie was unreasonable as\r\na matter of law.  Working more than forty hours per week is an\r\nessential function of her position.  Tardie's request to work only\r\nforty hours per week was a request to eliminate this essential\r\nfunction.  We have previously held that an employer need not\r\naccommodate a disability by foregoing an essential function of the\r\njob.  See Feliciano, 160 F.3d at 785; Laurin, 150 F.3d at 56.\r\n   In short, the district court did not err in finding:\r\n(1) that working more than forty hours per week was an essential\r\nfunction of her position, and (2) that Tardie was unable to perform\r\nthat essential function.  Therefore, 29 C.F.R.  825.214(b)\r\nrelieved appellees of the obligation to reinstate Tardie following\r\nher FMLA leave, and the district court properly denied Tardie's\r\nFMLA claim on this basis.\r\nD.  Tardie's State Law Causes of Action\r\n   Tardie assigns no separate or additional error to the\r\ndistrict court in its assessment of her state law claims under\r\nRICRIHA, FEPA, and PFMLA.  The district court found that those\r\nstate law claims required the same analysis as that utilized for\r\nthe corresponding federal statutes already discussed.  Tardie does\r\nnot challenge this determination; rather, she agrees with it.  From\r\nthis, Tardie argues that the genuine issues of material fact that\r\nshe claims to have identified with regard to her federal claims\r\nalso serve to foreclose summary judgment on her state law claims. \r\nBecause we find that no genuine issue exists with regard to\r\nTardie's ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and FMLA claims, we also find\r\nthat no genuine issue exists with regard to Tardie's state law\r\nclaims. See Hodgens, 144 F.3d at 158 n.1; Cook v. Rhode Island\r\nDepartment of Mental Health, Retardation and Hosps., 10 F.3d 17, 21\r\nn.2 (1st Cir. 1993).  Therefore, the district court did not err in\r\ngranting summary judgment against those causes of action.\r\n                          CONCLUSION\r\n   Based on the foregoing, the district court's entry of\r\nsummary judgment against Tardie's claims is AFFIRMED.\r\n",

Tardie alleges that she was discharged from her position as Director of Human Resources at RHRI due to her disability and while she was on medical leave.  On May 29, 1998, the district court entered summary judgment against Tardie's claims.  Tardie appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January of 1990, Tardie began working as a personnel assistant in the Human Resources Department at Braintree.  Tardie subsequently received several promotions, and in late 1993, Tardie was selected by her supervisor, Richard Horne, to establish the Human Resources Department at the newly-formed RHRI.  One of Tardie's tasks in setting up the department was drafting the job description of the Director of Human Resources at RHRI.  That job description gave a summary of the position and outlined the essential qualifications, requirements, and functions of the position.  One of the listed requirements was \"ABILITY TO MAINTAIN ASSIGNED WORK HOURS:  Has sufficient endurance to perform tasks over long periods of time.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January of 1994, Tardie was appointed as Director of Human Resources at RHRI.  In this position, Tardie earned a salary of approximately $50,000 per year and worked \"anywhere from 50 to 70 hours per week.\"   In July of 1994, Tardie began to experience chest pain, shortness of breath, numbness in her arms, and dizziness.  Tardie's doctor conducted tests on her heart and found results consistent with a left atrial enlargement.  Tardie was then placed on medical leave of absence from July 26 through September 6, 1994.  Horne, who was still Tardie's supervisor, called Tardie, and Tardie told him that she believed that working excessive hours was causing the symptoms.  Horne offered to return Tardie to her former position at Braintree, and Tardie accepted the offer.  Tardie wrote a \"thank you\" note to Horne, thanking him for all he had done for her, apologizing that she \"couldn't do it,\" and stating that she \"gave it [her] best.\"   Tardie testified in her deposition that, by \"it,\" she meant the long hours of the position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 16, 1995, Horne and Tardie met to discuss the status of her employment.  Horne stated that there were no available positions at RHRI, but that he would create a part-time position as a recruiter at Braintree if Tardie was interested.  Otherwise, Horne offered to assist her in obtaining a severance package from RHRI and finding employment with another company.  Rather than resign or allow Horne to create the part-time position, Tardie called Donald Burman, the Chief Executive Officer of RHRI, and told him that she intended to return to RHRI.  She stated that she would gradually increase her working hours to a maximum of forty hours per week, but that she could no longer work the extended hours she had been working.  Burman agreed and stated that they could work it out.  Tardie then called Horne, who told her that he could justify adding a part-time person to assist Tardie and that he would present this idea to Burman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Horne, Burman and Lisa LaDew, Chief Operating Officer at RHRI, then met to discuss Tardie's situation.  Tardie alleges that Horne, Burman and LaDew discussed her medical condition and assumed that she suffered from an enlarged heart.  The three individuals decided not to reinstate Tardie as Human Resources Director because they determined that Tardie could not perform the job while working only forty hours per week.  Horne called Tardie to inform her of the decision and told her that she needed to discuss the matter with Burman.  Burman later explained to Tardie the basis for the decision and offered to put together a severance package for her.  A package was later offered, but Tardie refused to accept it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 27, 1996, Tardie filed a complaint against RHRI and Braintree in United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.  Tardie alleged that her discharge violated:  (1) the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"Rehabilitation Act\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 791 et seq.;  (2) the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 et seq.;  (3) the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (\"FMLA\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2601 et seq.;  (4) the Rhode Island Civil Rights of Individuals with Handicaps Act (\"RICRIHA\"), R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 42-87-1 et seq.;  (5) the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act (\"FEPA\"), R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 28-5-1 et seq.;   and (6) the Rhode Island Parental and Family Medical Leave Act (\"PFMLA\"), R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 28-48-1 et seq.   After the close of discovery, appellees moved for summary judgment on all counts.  The district court granted appellees' motion, finding:  (1) that Tardie was unable to demonstrate that she suffered from a \"disability\" or was perceived as suffering from a \"disability\" under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act, and (2) that Tardie was unable to work fifty to seventy hours per week, which was one of the essential functions of her position.  The district court entered judgment against all of Tardie's claims on May 28, 1998, and this timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tardie argues that the district court erred in entering summary judgment against her six causes of action.  Summary judgment is proper where \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  Once the moving party has pointed to the absence of adequate evidence supporting the nonmoving party's case, the onus is on the nonmoving party to present facts that show a genuine issue for trial.  See Serrano-Cruz v. DFI Puerto Rico, Inc., 109 F.3d 23, 25 (1st Cir.1997);  LeBlanc v. Great American Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 841-42 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1018, 114 S.Ct. 1398, 128 L.Ed.2d 72 (1994).  \"[A] party opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment may not rest upon mere allegation or denials of his pleading, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)(citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)).  \"[P]laintiff ... [must] offer[ ] ... 'significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint.' \"  Id. at 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (quoting from First National Bank of Arizona v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S. 253, 290, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968)).  We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo.  See Serrano-Cruz, 109 F.3d at 25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Americans With Disabilities Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove her ADA claim, Tardie must establish:  (1) that she suffered from a \"disability\" within the meaning of the ADA;  (2) that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job, either with or without reasonable accommodation;  and (3) that her employer discharged her in whole or in part because of that disability.  See Feliciano v. State of Rhode Island, 160 F.3d 780, 784 (1st Cir.1998) (citing Katz v. City Metal Co., Inc., 87 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir.1996)).  The district court found that it did not need to reach the second or third elements because Tardie could not establish that she had or has a disability as defined by the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulations governing the ADA define \"disability\" as:  (A) having a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of an individual's major life activities;  (B) having a record of such an impairment;  or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2);  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(g).  The district court rejected Tardie's arguments that she had a \"disability\" under subsections (2)(A) and (2)(C).  On appeal, Tardie argues only that she was disabled under subsection (2)(C), or that appellees regarded her as having a substantially limiting impairment.  An individual who has an impairment that is not substantially limiting (or has no impairment at all) is nevertheless \"disabled\" if she is treated by her employer as having an impairment that does substantially limit major life activities.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(l);  Katz, 87 F.3d at 32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tardie argues that there is ample evidence that appellees regarded her as suffering from an impairment.  Tardie claims that appellees demonstrated their perception of her as disabled at the meeting between Horne, Burman, and LaDew.  Tardie claims that the decision to discharge her was based upon appellees' misperception that she suffered from a heart condition which rendered her unable to perform her job, either with or without reasonable accommodation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tardie has clearly demonstrated that appellees regarded her as having an impairment that prevented her from working more than forty hours per week;  Tardie specifically told them as much.  The question becomes whether such an impairment is an impairment that \"substantially limits\" one of Tardie's \"major life activities\".  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2);  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(g).  As noted by the district court, working is a major life activity, but the perceived impairment is not one that substantially limits the activity of working.  The relevant regulation defines \"substantially limits,\" in the context of the activity of working, as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.  The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(j)(3).  Hence, the fact that appellees may have regarded Tardie as unable to work more than 40 hours per week, and thereby unable to perform her particular job, does not mean that appellees regarded her as being substantially limited in the major life activity of working.  \"An impairment that disqualifies a person from only a narrow range of jobs is not considered a substantially limiting one.\"  Heilweil v. Mount Sinai Hosp., 32 F.3d 718, 723 (2d Cir.1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1147, 115 S.Ct. 1095, 130 L.Ed.2d 1063 (1995);  see also McKay v. Toyota Mfg., U.S.A., Inc., 110 F.3d 369, 373 (6th Cir.1997) (citing Heilweil and finding that the plaintiff's inability to perform repetitive-motion factory work did not restrict her ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs);  Wooten v. Farmland Foods, 58 F.3d 382, 386 (8th Cir.1995) (citing Heilweil ).   As the district court noted, there are vast employment opportunities available which require only 40-hour work weeks.  Without more, we cannot ascribe error to the district court's finding that appellees regarded Tardie as having an impairment that did not substantially limit one or more of her major life activities.  Therefore, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment against Tardie's ADA claim for failure to demonstrate that she suffered from a disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Rehabilitation Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 504(a) of the Rehabilitation Act provides that \"[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability ... be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 794(a).  In any claim under the Rehabilitation Act, the plaintiff must first establish that she has a disability covered by the Act.  See Leary v. Dalton, 58 F.3d 748, 752 (1st Cir.1995).  As discussed above, Tardie has not raised a genuine issue with regard to whether she has a \"disability\" under the ADA.  \"Disability\" is defined identically under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  Compare 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2)(statutory definition of ADA's \"disability\") and 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(g) (regulatory definition of ADA's \"disability\") with 29 U.S.C. &#167; 705(20) (statutory definition of Rehabilitation Act's \"individual with a disability\") and 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1614.203(a)(1) (regulatory definition of Rehabilitation Act's \"individual with handicaps\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the ADA's definition of \"substantially limits\" under 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(j)(3) does not appear to have a counterpart in the Rehabilitation Act or its regulations, Congress has provided that the standards used to determine whether &#167; 504 of the Rehabilitation Act has been violated in a complaint alleging employment discrimination shall be the standards applied to employment discrimination actions under the ADA, see 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794(d).  Additionally, several courts have held, in the Rehabilitation Act context, that the inability to perform a particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.  See, e.g., Heilweil, 32 F.3d at 723-24 (collecting cases for the proposition and finding that the plaintiff's inability to work in one particular place did not constitute a disability);  Gupton v. Virginia, 14 F.3d 203, 205 (4th Cir.)  (finding that a plaintiff did not demonstrate that an impairment limited her ability to work when she presented only evidence that it prevented her from performing one particular job), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 810, 115 S.Ct. 59, 130 L.Ed.2d 17 (1994);  Byrne v. Board of Educ., 979 F.2d 560, 565 (7th Cir.1992) (stating that it is well-established that a person's inability to perform a specific job for a specific employer does not substantially limit that person's ability to work);  Welsh v. City of Tulsa, 977 F.2d 1415, 1417-18 (10th Cir.1992) (holding that an impairment that an employer perceives as limiting an individual's ability to perform only one job is not a handicap under the Rehabilitation Act);  Maulding v. Sullivan, 961 F.2d 694, 698 (8th Cir.1992)(finding no error in the district court's conclusion that the inability to perform lab work does not substantially limit employment as a whole), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 910, 113 S.Ct. 1255, 122 L.Ed.2d 653 (1993).  Therefore, the district court properly granted summary judgment against Tardie's Rehabilitation Act claim for the same reason her ADA claim fails:  she has not shown that appellees regarded her as having an impairment which substantially limits a major life activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The Family and Medical Leave Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tardie also claims that her termination while she was on medical leave violated the FMLA.  An eligible employee who takes leave under the FMLA is entitled to be restored to the same or an equivalent position upon returning from leave.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2614(a)(1);  Hodgens v. General Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 159 (1st Cir.1998) (citing 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2614(a)(1) and 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.100(c)).  However, the regulations promulgated under the FMLA state that \"[i]f the employee is unable to perform an essential function of the position because of a physical or mental condition ... the employee has no right to restoration to another position under the FMLA.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.214(b).  The regulation then goes on to state that the employer in such a situation may have obligations under the ADA.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In analyzing Tardie's FMLA claim under &#167; 825.214(b), the district court found:  (1) that the position of Human Resources Director at RHRI requires the employee to work fifty to seventy hours per week, and (2) that the ability to work extended hours was an essential function of the position.  Because Tardie cannot work more than forty hours per week, the district court found that Tardie could not perform an essential function of the position, and therefore had no right to reinstatement.  Tardie raises several arguments challenging this finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Tardie claims that the evidence does not support a finding that an essential function of her job was working more than 40 hours per week.  She points to the job description of the Director of Human Resources position--which she wrote--and notes that it does not set forth the ability to work sixty to seventy-hour weeks as an essential function of the position.  However, that job description does state that the person holding the position must have \"sufficient endurance to perform tasks over long periods of time.\"   Also, Tardie herself testified in her deposition that:  (1) dealing with employee issues beyond the hours of 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. was \"part of the job\";  (2) she frequently needed to be present at the hospital for at least a portion of all three of the hospital's eight-hour work shifts;  (3) the position often required her to return to work after she had gone home for the evening;  and (4) she worked \"anywhere from 50 to 70 [hours per week] depending on what [she] was doing.\"   The only evidence Tardie offers to support a finding that working extended hours was not an essential function of the position was a payroll check stub that stated that Tardie's salary was based upon a 40-hour week.  However, even overlooking the fact that this payroll documentation was created by an outside accounting organization, this evidence does not support Tardie's position.  Tardie was a salaried employee who was not required to keep track of the hours she worked.  The fact that she was attributed a 40-hour work week for payroll purposes hardly demonstrates that only 40-hour work weeks were required of her in the actual performance of her position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, Tardie's counsel argued that the time spent at a job is not a \"function\" of the job;  it is a capability.  Tardie claims that only specific duties can be \"functions\" of a position.  Tardie attempts to distinguish her position's extended-hours requirement from the essential functions involved in Feliciano, 160 F.3d at 785 (lifting patients), and Laurin v. Providence Hospital, Massachusetts Nurses Assoc., 150 F.3d 52, 57 (1st Cir.1998) (working the night shift).  Tardie describes lifting patients and working the night shift as \"specific duties\" and describes the hours worked as a \"capability.\"   Tardie cites no authority for this distinction, and we believe it to be mere semantics.  It strains credulity to argue that the time of day that the hours are required to be worked can constitute an essential function but that the number of hours required to be worked cannot.  At bottom, Tardie offers no evidence that she or anyone else could perform the job in only forty hours per week and offers no evidence to rebut appellees' evidence that the extended-hours requirement is an essential function of the position.  Consequently, the district court did not err in finding that working more than 40 hours per week was an essential function of the position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, Tardie argues that, even if she were unable to perform the essential functions of her job, appellees were still required to offer her the same or equivalent position with reasonable accommodations.  Tardie claims that she has at least raised a genuine issue with regard to whether her request to work only a 40-hour week was a reasonable accommodation.  We disagree.  First of all, it is not at all clear that the concept of \"reasonable accommodation\" is applicable in the FMLA context.  Section 825.214(b) eliminates the obligation to reinstate an employee returning from FMLA leave if that employee is \"unable to perform an essential function of the position.\"  29 C.F.R. 825.214(b).  Unlike the ADA, this FMLA regulation omits the qualifying \"with or without reasonable accommodation\" language.  The regulation goes on to state that the employer may have obligations under the ADA,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but this reminder does not import the \"reasonable accommodation\" qualifier into the FMLA context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, even if the \"reasonable accommodation\" language did apply to this exception to the FMLA reinstatement requirement, the accommodation sought by Tardie was unreasonable as a matter of law.  Working more than forty hours per week is an essential function of her position.  Tardie's request to work only forty hours per week was a request to eliminate this essential function.  We have previously held that an employer need not accommodate a disability by foregoing an essential function of the job.  See Feliciano, 160 F.3d at 785;  Laurin, 150 F.3d at 56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the district court did not err in finding:  (1) that working more than forty hours per week was an essential function of her position, and (2) that Tardie was unable to perform that essential function.  Therefore, 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.214(b) relieved appellees of the obligation to reinstate Tardie following her FMLA leave, and the district court properly denied Tardie's FMLA claim on this basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Tardie's State Law Causes of Action</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tardie assigns no separate or additional error to the district court in its assessment of her state law claims under RICRIHA, FEPA, and PFMLA.  The district court found that those state law claims required the same analysis as that utilized for the corresponding federal statutes already discussed.  Tardie does not challenge this determination;  rather, she agrees with it.  From this, Tardie argues that the genuine issues of material fact that she claims to have identified with regard to her federal claims also serve to foreclose summary judgment on her state law claims.

Tardie alleges that she was discharged from her position as Director of Human Resources at RHRI due to her disability and while she was on medical leave.  On May 29, 1998, the district court entered summary judgment against Tardie's claims.  Tardie appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January of 1990, Tardie began working as a personnel assistant in the Human Resources Department at Braintree.  Tardie subsequently received several promotions, and in late 1993, Tardie was selected by her supervisor, Richard Horne, to establish the Human Resources Department at the newly-formed RHRI.  One of Tardie's tasks in setting up the department was drafting the job description of the Director of Human Resources at RHRI.  That job description gave a summary of the position and outlined the essential qualifications, requirements, and functions of the position.  One of the listed requirements was \"ABILITY TO MAINTAIN ASSIGNED WORK HOURS:  Has sufficient endurance to perform tasks over long periods of time.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January of 1994, Tardie was appointed as Director of Human Resources at RHRI.  In this position, Tardie earned a salary of approximately $50,000 per year and worked \"anywhere from 50 to 70 hours per week.\"   In July of 1994, Tardie began to experience chest pain, shortness of breath, numbness in her arms, and dizziness.  Tardie's doctor conducted tests on her heart and found results consistent with a left atrial enlargement.  Tardie was then placed on medical leave of absence from July 26 through September 6, 1994.  Horne, who was still Tardie's supervisor, called Tardie, and Tardie told him that she believed that working excessive hours was causing the symptoms.  Horne offered to return Tardie to her former position at Braintree, and Tardie accepted the offer.  Tardie wrote a \"thank you\" note to Horne, thanking him for all he had done for her, apologizing that she \"couldn't do it,\" and stating that she \"gave it [her] best.\"   Tardie testified in her deposition that, by \"it,\" she meant the long hours of the position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 16, 1995, Horne and Tardie met to discuss the status of her employment.  Horne stated that there were no available positions at RHRI, but that he would create a part-time position as a recruiter at Braintree if Tardie was interested.  Otherwise, Horne offered to assist her in obtaining a severance package from RHRI and finding employment with another company.  Rather than resign or allow Horne to create the part-time position, Tardie called Donald Burman, the Chief Executive Officer of RHRI, and told him that she intended to return to RHRI.  She stated that she would gradually increase her working hours to a maximum of forty hours per week, but that she could no longer work the extended hours she had been working.  Burman agreed and stated that they could work it out.  Tardie then called Horne, who told her that he could justify adding a part-time person to assist Tardie and that he would present this idea to Burman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Horne, Burman and Lisa LaDew, Chief Operating Officer at RHRI, then met to discuss Tardie's situation.  Tardie alleges that Horne, Burman and LaDew discussed her medical condition and assumed that she suffered from an enlarged heart.  The three individuals decided not to reinstate Tardie as Human Resources Director because they determined that Tardie could not perform the job while working only forty hours per week.  Horne called Tardie to inform her of the decision and told her that she needed to discuss the matter with Burman.  Burman later explained to Tardie the basis for the decision and offered to put together a severance package for her.  A package was later offered, but Tardie refused to accept it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 27, 1996, Tardie filed a complaint against RHRI and Braintree in United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.  Tardie alleged that her discharge violated:  (1) the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"Rehabilitation Act\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 791 et seq.;  (2) the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 et seq.;  (3) the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (\"FMLA\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2601 et seq.;  (4) the Rhode Island Civil Rights of Individuals with Handicaps Act (\"RICRIHA\"), R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 42-87-1 et seq.;  (5) the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act (\"FEPA\"), R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 28-5-1 et seq.;   and (6) the Rhode Island Parental and Family Medical Leave Act (\"PFMLA\"), R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 28-48-1 et seq.   After the close of discovery, appellees moved for summary judgment on all counts.  The district court granted appellees' motion, finding:  (1) that Tardie was unable to demonstrate that she suffered from a \"disability\" or was perceived as suffering from a \"disability\" under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act, and (2) that Tardie was unable to work fifty to seventy hours per week, which was one of the essential functions of her position.  The district court entered judgment against all of Tardie's claims on May 28, 1998, and this timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tardie argues that the district court erred in entering summary judgment against her six causes of action.  Summary judgment is proper where \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  Once the moving party has pointed to the absence of adequate evidence supporting the nonmoving party's case, the onus is on the nonmoving party to present facts that show a genuine issue for trial.

See Feliciano v. State of Rhode Island, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759220\"><a href=\"/opinion/759220/rosemary-feliciano-v-state-of-rhode-island/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></a></span>, 784 (1st Cir.1998) (citing Katz v.

The district court found that it did not need to reach the second or third elements because Tardie could not establish that she had or has a disability as defined by the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulations governing the ADA define \"disability\" as:  (A) having a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of an individual's major life activities;  (B) having a record of such an impairment;  or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2);  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(g).  The district court rejected Tardie's arguments that she had a \"disability\" under subsections (2)(A) and (2)(C).  On appeal, Tardie argues only that she was disabled under subsection (2)(C), or that appellees regarded her as having a substantially limiting impairment.  An individual who has an impairment that is not substantially limiting (or has no impairment at all) is nevertheless \"disabled\" if she is treated by her employer as having an impairment that does substantially limit major life activities.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(l);  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196845\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Katz,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196845/katz-v-city-metal-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tardie argues that there is ample evidence that appellees regarded her as suffering from an impairment.  Tardie claims that appellees demonstrated their perception of her as disabled at the meeting between Horne, Burman, and LaDew.  Tardie claims that the decision to discharge her was based upon appellees' misperception that she suffered from a heart condition which rendered her unable to perform her job, either with or without reasonable accommodation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tardie has clearly demonstrated that appellees regarded her as having an impairment that prevented her from working more than forty hours per week;  Tardie specifically told them as much.  The question becomes whether such an impairment is an impairment that \"substantially limits\" one of Tardie's \"major life activities\".  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2);  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(g).  As noted by the district court, working is a major life activity, but the perceived impairment is not one that substantially limits the activity of working.  The relevant regulation defines \"substantially limits,\" in the context of the activity of working, as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.  The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(j)(3).  Hence, the fact that appellees may have regarded Tardie as unable to work more than 40 hours per week, and thereby unable to perform her particular job, does not mean that appellees regarded her as being substantially limited in the major life activity of working.  \"An impairment that disqualifies a person from only a narrow range of jobs is not considered a substantially limiting one.\"  Heilweil v.

As the district court noted, there are vast employment opportunities available which require only 40-hour work weeks.  Without more, we cannot ascribe error to the district court's finding that appellees regarded Tardie as having an impairment that did not substantially limit one or more of her major life activities.  Therefore, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment against Tardie's ADA claim for failure to demonstrate that she suffered from a disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Rehabilitation Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 504(a) of the Rehabilitation Act provides that \"[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability ... be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 794(a).  In any claim under the Rehabilitation Act, the plaintiff must first establish that she has a disability covered by the Act.  See Leary v. Dalton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196146\"><a href=\"/opinion/196146/leary-v-navy-secretary/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span>, 752 (1st Cir.1995).  As discussed above, Tardie has not raised a genuine issue with regard to whether she has a \"disability\" under the ADA.  \"Disability\" is defined identically under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  Compare 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2)(statutory definition of ADA's \"disability\") and 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(g) (regulatory definition of ADA's \"disability\") with 29 U.S.C. &#167; 705(20) (statutory definition of Rehabilitation Act's \"individual with a disability\") and 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1614.203(a)(1) (regulatory definition of Rehabilitation Act's \"individual with handicaps\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the ADA's definition of \"substantially limits\" under 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(j)(3) does not appear to have a counterpart in the Rehabilitation Act or its regulations, Congress has provided that the standards used to determine whether &#167; 504 of the Rehabilitation Act has been violated in a complaint alleging employment discrimination shall be the standards applied to employment discrimination actions under the ADA, see 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794(d).  Additionally, several courts have held, in the Rehabilitation Act context, that the inability to perform a particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.

An eligible employee who takes leave under the FMLA is entitled to be restored to the same or an equivalent position upon returning from leave.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2614(a)(1);  Hodgens v. General Dynamics Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197958\"><a href=\"/opinion/197958/hodgens-v-general-dynamics-cor/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span>, 159 (1st Cir.1998) (citing 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2614(a)(1) and 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.100(c)).  However, the regulations promulgated under the FMLA state that \"[i]f the employee is unable to perform an essential function of the position because of a physical or mental condition ... the employee has no right to restoration to another position under the FMLA.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.214(b).  The regulation then goes on to state that the employer in such a situation may have obligations under the ADA.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In analyzing Tardie's FMLA claim under &#167; 825.214(b), the district court found:  (1) that the position of Human Resources Director at RHRI requires the employee to work fifty to seventy hours per week, and (2) that the ability to work extended hours was an essential function of the position.  Because Tardie cannot work more than forty hours per week, the district court found that Tardie could not perform an essential function of the position, and therefore had no right to reinstatement.  Tardie raises several arguments challenging this finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Tardie claims that the evidence does not support a finding that an essential function of her job was working more than 40 hours per week.  She points to the job description of the Director of Human Resources position--which she wrote--and notes that it does not set forth the ability to work sixty to seventy-hour weeks as an essential function of the position.  However, that job description does state that the person holding the position must have \"sufficient endurance to perform tasks over long periods of time.\"   Also, Tardie herself testified in her deposition that:  (1) dealing with employee issues beyond the hours of 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. was \"part of the job\";  (2) she frequently needed to be present at the hospital for at least a portion of all three of the hospital's eight-hour work shifts;  (3) the position often required her to return to work after she had gone home for the evening;  and (4) she worked \"anywhere from 50 to 70 [hours per week] depending on what [she] was doing.\"   The only evidence Tardie offers to support a finding that working extended hours was not an essential function of the position was a payroll check stub that stated that Tardie's salary was based upon a 40-hour week.  However, even overlooking the fact that this payroll documentation was created by an outside accounting organization, this evidence does not support Tardie's position.  Tardie was a salaried employee who was not required to keep track of the hours she worked.  The fact that she was attributed a 40-hour work week for payroll purposes hardly demonstrates that only 40-hour work weeks were required of her in the actual performance of her position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, Tardie's counsel argued that the time spent at a job is not a \"function\" of the job;  it is a capability.  Tardie claims that only specific duties can be \"functions\" of a position.  Tardie attempts to distinguish her position's extended-hours requirement from the essential functions involved in <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759220\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Feliciano,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/759220/rosemary-feliciano-v-state-of-rhode-island/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">785</span> </a></span>(lifting patients), and Laurin v. Providence Hospital, Massachusetts Nurses Assoc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756419\"><a href=\"/opinion/756419/sharon-laurin-v-the-providence-hospital-and-massachusetts-nurses/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir.1998) (working the night shift).  Tardie describes lifting patients and working the night shift as \"specific duties\" and describes the hours worked as a \"capability.\"   Tardie cites no authority for this distinction, and we believe it to be mere semantics.  It strains credulity to argue that the time of day that the hours are required to be worked can constitute an essential function but that the number of hours required to be worked cannot.  At bottom, Tardie offers no evidence that she or anyone else could perform the job in only forty hours per week and offers no evidence to rebut appellees' evidence that the extended-hours requirement is an essential function of the position.  Consequently, the district court did not err in finding that working more than 40 hours per week was an essential function of the position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, Tardie argues that, even if she were unable to perform the essential functions of her job, appellees were still required to offer her the same or equivalent position with reasonable accommodations.  Tardie claims that she has at least raised a genuine issue with regard to whether her request to work only a 40-hour week was a reasonable accommodation.  We disagree.  First of all, it is not at all clear that the concept of \"reasonable accommodation\" is applicable in the FMLA context.  Section 825.214(b) eliminates the obligation to reinstate an employee returning from FMLA leave if that employee is \"unable to perform an essential function of the position.\"  29 C.F.R. 825.214(b).  Unlike the ADA, this FMLA regulation omits the qualifying \"with or without reasonable accommodation\" language.  The regulation goes on to state that the employer may have obligations under the ADA,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but this reminder does not import the \"reasonable accommodation\" qualifier into the FMLA context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, even if the \"reasonable accommodation\" language did apply to this exception to the FMLA reinstatement requirement, the accommodation sought by Tardie was unreasonable as a matter of law.  Working more than forty hours per week is an essential function of her position.  Tardie's request to work only forty hours per week was a request to eliminate this essential function.  We have previously held that an employer need not accommodate a disability by foregoing an essential function of the job.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759220\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Feliciano,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/759220/rosemary-feliciano-v-state-of-rhode-island/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">785</span></a></span>;  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756419\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Laurin,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/756419/sharon-laurin-v-the-providence-hospital-and-massachusetts-nurses/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the district court did not err in finding:  (1) that working more than forty hours per week was an essential function of her position, and (2) that Tardie was unable to perform that essential function.  Therefore, 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.214(b) relieved appellees of the obligation to reinstate Tardie following her FMLA leave, and the district court properly denied Tardie's FMLA claim on this basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Tardie's State Law Causes of Action</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tardie assigns no separate or additional error to the district court in its assessment of her state law claims under RICRIHA, FEPA, and PFMLA.  The district court found that those state law claims required the same analysis as that utilized for the corresponding federal statutes already discussed.  Tardie does not challenge this determination;  rather, she agrees with it.  From this, Tardie argues that the genuine issues of material fact that she claims to have identified with regard to her federal claims also serve to foreclose summary judgment on her state law claims.  Because we find that no genuine issue exists with regard to Tardie's ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and FMLA claims, we also find that no genuine issue exists with regard to Tardie's state law claims.
