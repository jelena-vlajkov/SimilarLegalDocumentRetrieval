Gentile, Esq.,  On Memorandum  In Support  of Motion for\r                                  \r\nSummary Disposition for appellees. \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per  Curiam.   Bernardo  Figueroa appeals  from the\r                                 \r\n\ndistrict  court's decision that  a prison  disciplinary board\r\n\ndid  not violate  his  federal due  process  rights under  42\r\n\nU.S.C.   1983 when it found him guilty of planning  to murder\r\n\nCaptain  Ronald Brodeur,  a correction  officer.   We affirm.\r\n\nSince  the facts have been described  in the district court's\r\n\nopinion, we do not repeat them here except as is necessary to\r\n\nexplain our  affirmance.   We turn immediately  to Figueroa's\r\n\ncontentions on appeal.\r\n\n          1.  Notice of Time of Disciplinary Hearing\r                                                                \r\n\n          Figueroa claims  that he  was not given  a required\r\n\n24-hour notice of his  disciplinary hearing and that delivery\r\n\nof the disciplinary report to him two days before the hearing\r\n\nwas insufficient  notice.  Federal  law does not  require 24-\r\n\nhour  advance notice of a disciplinary  hearing, however.  It\r\n\nrequires only  that inmates  be given  written notice of  the\r\n\ncharges   against  them   at  least   24  hours   before  the\r                   \r\n\ndisciplinary hearing.   See Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539,\r                                                          \r\n\n564  (1974).    This   court  has  said  that   delivering  a\r\n\ndisciplinary report describing the  charges against an inmate\r\n\nto the inmate meets that requirement.  See Langton v. Berman,\r                                                                        \r\n\n667 F.2d 231,  234 (1st Cir. 1981).  Since  Figueroa does not\r\n\ndispute that  he received a  copy of the  disciplinary report\r\n\ndescribing  the  charge  against  him  two  days  before  the\r\r\n\ndisciplinary  hearing, the district court correctly concluded\r\n\nthat the notice given to Figueroa satisfied due process.1\r\n\n          2.  Provision of Interpreter\r                                                  \r\n\n          Figueroa alleges  that he should have  been given a\r\n\nSpanish-speaking counselor  to assist him at the disciplinary\r\n\nhearing  rather  than  an  English-speaking  counselor.    He\r\n\nacknowledges  that  he  understands English,  except  for  an\r\n\noccasional  word, but says he does not speak English well and\r\n\nso could not participate \"fully\" in the hearing.  (His spoken\r\n\nEnglish can be hard  to understand, as the hearing  and trial\r\n\ntranscripts show.)  At trial, Figueroa said that he had asked\r\n\nboth Jack Ward, his  English-speaking counselor, and  Captain\r\n\nAndrew Anderson, the chairman of the disciplinary board,  for\r\n\nMaria  Pezza's   assistance,  but  was  told   that  she  was\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  On appeal, Figueroa appears to claim as well that failure\r\nto provide 24-hour advance notice of the hearing violated the\r\nMorris Rules,  which are regulations governing the discipline\r\nand  classification of  inmates at  the state  facility where\r\nFigueroa is incarcerated and which have the  force and effect\r\nof state  law.  See  Rodi v.  Ventetuolo, 941 F.2d  22, 26-28\r                                                    \r\n(1st Cir. 1991).  The version of the Morris Rules at issue is\r\nappended to  Morris v.  Travisono, 499  F. Supp.  149 (D.R.I.\r                                             \r\n1980).    Figueroa's  state law  claims  are  not before  us.\r\nAlthough  his  complaint  asserted  both  state  and  federal\r\nclaims, in his pre-trial  memorandum Figueroa argued only his\r\ndue process  claims, relying on cases  discussing federal due\r\nprocess.   Without objection by Figueroa,  the district court\r\nissued  a  pre-trial  order   limiting  the  evidence  to  be\r\npresented  at trial to the  federal due process  issues.  The\r\ncourt's  decision  resolved  only  the  federal  due  process\r\nclaims.  Since the  court never asserted pendent jurisdiction\r\nover Figueroa's state  law claims and  did not resolve  those\r\nclaims,  Figueroa remains free to bring  his state law claims\r\nin state court if not otherwise barred from doing so by state\r\nlaw, e.g., by any applicable statute of limitations.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nunavailable.2    Figueroa wanted  her  to assist  him  at the\r\n\nhearing because she could explain words he did not understand\r\n\nand she would have \"defend[ed]\" him.  \r\n\n          We  agree  with  the  district court  that  no  due\r\n\nprocess violation occurred here.   In part, Figueroa seems to\r\n\nhave  hoped that  Pezza  could have  presented his  case more\r\n\npersuasively to the disciplinary board than he did.  In other\r\n\nwords,  Pezza would have been  useful to him  as an advocate.\r\n\nIn Wolff, the Supreme Court  held that inmates do not have  a\r                    \r\n\nright  to counsel  in disciplinary  proceedings, 418  U.S. at\r\n\n570, a  position it  confirmed in Baxter  v. Palmigiano,  425\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S. 308,  315 (1976).   The  Court suggested,  however, that\r\n\nilliterate inmates  or inmates  with complex cases  should be\r\n\nable to \"seek  the aid of a  fellow inmate, or . .  . to have\r\n\nadequate substitute aid in the form of help from the  staff .\r\n\n.  . .\"  See Wolff, 418  U.S. at 570.  Assuming that Figueroa\r                              \r\n\nshould have been treated as  an illiterate inmate, any  right\r\n\nthat  he may  have had  to staff  assistance under  Wolff was\r                                                                     \r\n\nsatisfied when Ward was  assigned to help him.   In addition,\r\n\nnothing  in  the  record  suggests  that  any  deficiency  in\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The  district  court  apparently  discredited  Figueroa's\r\ntestimony at trial that he had asked for Pezza's  assistance,\r\nrelying on  the transcript of the  disciplinary hearing which\r\ndid not  record any  such request.   Anderson  testified that\r\nFigueroa had never asked him for a Spanish-speaking counselor\r\nor interpreter  and that he  would have  readily granted  any\r\nsuch request.   However, Figueroa testified that he  had also\r\nasked Ward for Pezza's assistance.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nFigueroa's  English  adversely   affected  the   disciplinary\r\n\nproceedings.   As  the  transcript of  the hearing  confirms,\r\n\nFigueroa  understands  spoken  English.    Despite  sometimes\r\n\nunclear  syntax,  he  can  also make  himself  understood  in\r\n\nEnglish.   At the hearing, he denied his guilt, explained why\r\n\nhe wanted  to call Captain  Brodeur as a  witness, challenged\r\n\nhis  lack of access to  confidential reports, and denied that\r\n\nhe had been  working in  the prison kitchen  at the time  the\r\n\nalleged  murder   weapon  disappeared.     Furthermore,  Ward\r\n\nappeared with him at the hearing and, according to Figueroa's\r\n\npost-trial brief, participated  in questioning  Investigating\r\n\nOfficer Joseph Forgue.3  Figueroa  presented his own case and\r\n\nthe transcript does  not reflect that  he ever sought  Ward's\r\n\naid  in   making  his  presentation.4     Moreover,  Figueroa\r\n\ntestified  that Anderson and Ward had told him that Pezza was\r\n\nunavailable, but does not  allege any unconditional denial of\r\n\nthe assistance of a Spanish-speaking counselor.  Although his\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Ward's  participation is  not  evident  from the  hearing\r\ntranscript  which  apparently   incorrectly  attributes   his\r\nquestions to disciplinary board members.\r\n\n4.  At trial, Figueroa stated  that Ward had been of  no help\r\nto him, but he  does not suggest that Ward's  alleged failure\r\nto help him is actionable under section 1983.   In any event,\r\nbecause there is no right  to counsel at prison  disciplinary\r\nhearings,  an inmate  has  no cause  of  action for  a  staff\r\nassistant's allegedly ineffective assistance.   See Bostic v.\r                                                                      \r\nCarlson, 884  F.2d 1267,  1274 (9th  Cir. 1989);  Harrison v.\r                                                                      \r\nSeay,  856 F. Supp. 1275, 1281 (W.D. Tenn. 1994); cf. Coleman\r                                                                         \r\nv.  Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 755 (1991) (because an inmate has\r                        \r\nno right to counsel to collaterally attack his conviction, he\r\nhas no claim for ineffective assistance of such counsel).  \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\ntestimony  may suggest that he  was told to  proceed with the\r\n\nhearing or  to  proceed  with  Ward  as  his  counselor,5  he\r\n\napparently did not actually  ask prison officials to postpone\r\n\nhis hearing until Pezza was available.  Anderson testified at\r\n\ntrial  that he had never  denied any inmate  the counselor of\r\n\nhis choice and that he had postponed hearings if the inmate's\r\n\npreferred  counselor was  absent.   We  therefore affirm  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's  determination  that  defendants   did  not\r\n\nviolate Figueroa's constitutional rights by not  appointing a\r\n\nSpanish-speaking counselor  or interpreter to aid  him at the\r\n\nhearing.\r\n\n          3.  Denial of Witnesses\r                                             \r\n\n          According   to  Figueroa,   he  should   have  been\r\n\npermitted to  call as  witnesses at his  disciplinary hearing\r\n\nCaptain  Brodeur, the  correction officer  Figueroa allegedly\r\n\nintended  to  murder;  an  Officer  Fletcher, who  apparently\r\n\ninvestigated  the alleged  murder  plot and/or  prepared  the\r\n\ndisciplinary  report against Figueroa; and two inmates, Larry\r\n\nBotton (also given as  Boton or Baton in the record) and Gary\r\n\nOrtiz.  At  the hearing,  Figueroa stated that  he wanted  to\r\n\ncall  Brodeur to  confirm  that he  and  Brodeur had  had  no\r\n\nproblems  with each other.  On appeal, Figueroa says that, if\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Figueroa  testified  as  follows:     \"I  ask  [Ward  and\r\nAnderson] if  I can have Spanish  counsellor, specific, Maria\r\nPezza.   I was told  that Maria Pezza  was embarcation at the\r\ntime, [inaudible].  I have to proceed.\"\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nFletcher, Botton and Ortiz had appeared at the hearing, their\r\n\n\"testimony  could  have  brought  forth  new or  previous[ly]\r\n\nunsolicited facts.\"  \r\n\n          At the  disciplinary hearing  and  again at  trial,\r\n\nCaptain  Anderson, the  chairman of  the  disciplinary board,\r\n\nexplained the board's determination that testimony by Brodeur\r\n\nabout his  relationship with Figueroa would  not be relevant.\r\n\nAlthough lack  of animosity  might normally seem  relevant in\r\n\ndetermining whether one individual might be motivated to kill\r\n\nanother,  Officer Joseph  Forgue,  who had  investigated  the\r\n\ncharge against  Figueroa, explained at the  hearing that such\r\n\nevidence would  be irrelevant in Figueroa's  case.  According\r\n\nto Forgue, it was \"well known\" in the prison that there was a\r\n\n\"contract\" on Brodeur's life and that confidential informants\r\n\nhad reported  that Figueroa had \"pick[ed]  up\" that contract.\r\n\nFor that reason,  an inmate would not \"have to have a problem\r\n\nwith  someone to stick  them.  That's  irrelevant whether you\r\n\nhad a problem with  them or not.\"  Given  Forgue's statement,\r\n\nthe board did not abuse its discretion in not calling Brodeur\r\n\nas a  witness.   See  Smith  v. Massachusetts  Department  of\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorrection,  936   F.2d  1390,  1399-1400  (1st   Cir.  1991)\r                      \r\n\n(applying   abuse   of  discretion   standard   in  reviewing\r\n\ndisciplinary  board's  failure  to  call  inmate  witnesses);\r\n\nTurner  v. Caspari,  38 F.3d  388, 391,  392 (8th  Cir. 1994)\r                              \r\n\n(noting that prison disciplinary boards have great discretion\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nto decline to call inmate witnesses  whose testimony would be\r\n\nirrelevant or unnecessary).6\r\n\n          Nor is there merit in Figueroa's claims  respecting\r\n\nBotton and Ortiz.  The transcript of the disciplinary hearing\r\n\nshows  that  he  never  asked  the  board  to  call  them  as\r\n\nwitnesses, and so the board obviously did not violate his due\r\n\nprocess  rights in not calling  them.  See  Harrison v. Seay,\r                                                                        \r\n\n856 F. Supp. 1275, 1281 (W.D. Tenn. 1994).7  \r\n\n          On appeal, Figueroa alleges that Officer Fletcher's\r\n\ntestimony  \"could  have  brought  forth  new  or previous[ly]\r\n\nunsolicited  facts.\"8    The  record indicates  that Figueroa\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Brodeur's testimony would  also have been cumulative  and\r\nwas  unnecessary for that  reason.   Figueroa told  the board\r\nthat  he had had no problems with Brodeur, and Forgue agreed,\r\ntelling the board that Figueroa had no motive to kill Brodeur\r\nthat  he knew  of and  that,  as Figueroa  had  said, he  and\r\nBrodeur did not appear to have problems with each other.  \r\n\n7.  In his pre-trial  memorandum, Figueroa told the  district\r\ncourt that Botton  would testify at  trial that Figueroa  had\r\nbeen  \"set up\" by a correction officer and another inmate and\r\nthat Ortiz would testify that an Officer  Martinez and inmate\r\nArmando Perez had plotted to set  him up.  The district court\r\nwould not  let Botton  and Ortiz testify,  ruling, correctly,\r\nthat the question  before the court was  not whether Figueroa\r\nwas  actually innocent of the charge against him.  On appeal,\r\nFigueroa appears to have abandoned the claim that  Botton and\r\nOrtiz would have testified that he had been set up.\r\n\n8.  In  his  post-trial   memorandum,  Figueroa  stated  that\r\nFletcher was the original investigating officer, that another\r\ninmate had been under  investigation, and that Fletcher would\r\ntestify  that Figueroa was the \"wrong man.\"  In his pre-trial\r\nmemorandum,  however,  Figueroa  had  shown  no  interest  in\r\ncalling  Fletcher  as  a  witness,  proffering   instead  the\r\ndistinctly  different  theory  described above  that  another\r\ninmate and a correction  officer had set him up.   On appeal,\r\nhe has obviously abandoned his claim that Fletcher would have\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nhad told the board that Fletcher would either offer favorable\r\n\ncharacter testimony or would corroborate  Figueroa's trouble-\r\n\nfree relationship with Brodeur.  The disciplinary  transcript\r\n\nindicates that  Figueroa told  the board that  Fletcher would\r\n\ntestify that Figueroa was \"not of that type of character\" and\r\n\nthat  the board  regarded  his testimony  to be  irrelevant.9\r\n\nAccording to  Anderson's trial  testimony, Figueroa  had said\r\n\nthat Fletcher would testify that Figueroa and Brodeur had not\r\n\nhad   any   problems   with   each  other.10      Under   the\r\n\ncircumstances, the court did  not err in concluding  that the\r\n\nboard had  not  violated due  process  by declining  to  call\r\n\nFletcher  as a  witness.   As  noted  above, testimony  about\r\n\nFigueroa's  relationship  with  Brodeur  was  irrelevant  and\r\n\nunnecessary.   In  addition, without  further specifics,  the\r\n\nsimple  testimony that Figueroa was not  the \"type\" of person\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ntestified that  a different inmate than  Figueroa had plotted\r\nto murder Brodeur. \r\n\n9.  The disciplinary hearing  transcript shows that  Figueroa\r\nasked to call Fletcher as a witness, but  does not record any\r\ndiscussion of  the substance  of Fletcher's testimony.   That\r\ndiscussion  apparently occurred,  however.    The  transcript\r\nindicates that Figueroa assented to Anderson's statement that\r\n\"you  request .  .  .

Accordingly,  we  do  not  decide   whether  substantial\r\nevidence in the record supported the board's decision.\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\nthe disciplinary board.\"   Figueroa recognizes that  granting\r\n\nhim access  to the  confidential report \"could  have violated\r\n\ninstitutional security  and other investigations.\"13   But he\r\n\nclaims that Ward could have reviewed the report and  inquired\r\n\ninto the informants' mutual corroboration, personal knowledge\r\n\nof the matter, and  reliability.  His point seems to  be that\r\n\nWard   might   have  uncovered   evidence   discrediting  the\r\n\ninformants or their information,  so that Ward's inability to\r\n\nsee  the  report not  only  violated  Figueroa's due  process\r\n\nrights,  but should  also  preclude the  district court  from\r\n\nconsidering  evidence deriving  from the  report.   Under the\r\n\ncircumstances  present  here, we  disagree.    First, as  the\r\n\nchairman of  the disciplinary  board testified at  trial, the\r\n\nboard  did not  rely on  the confidential  report in  finding\r\n\nFigueroa guilty; it did  not even see that report.   Although\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.  Therefore,  Figueroa is  apparently not  challenging the\r\ndistrict  court's finding that he was not entitled to see the\r                                             \r\nconfidential report which apparently  identified at least one\r\nof  the inmates who had reported that Figueroa had planned to\r\nkill  Brodeur.  It is  well established that  inmates have no\r\nfederal  due process  right  to obtain  evidence which  could\r\nidentify confidential informants.   See,  e.g., Langton,  667\r                                                                   \r\nF.2d at 235 (rejecting an inmate's contention that he had the\r\nright to cross-examine a confidential informant or review the\r\ninformant's  statement because  Wolff  left  such matters  to\r                                                 \r\nprison officials'  discretion); Mendoza v.

(According  to\r\n\nAnderson's trial testimony,  Forgue authored the confidential\r\n\nreport).   Figueroa was present  at the hearing and obviously\r\n\nknew  what Forgue had said.   Accordingly, he  was in exactly\r\n\nthe  same position as the  board in terms  of his familiarity\r\n\nwith the evidence  against him.   Figueroa  was permitted  to\r\n\nspeak freely during the  hearing and had the right  to cross-\r\n\nexamine Forgue.  See  Morris v. Travisono, 499 F.

At no  time during  the hearing did  Figueroa\r\n\nattempt to question Forgue about the confidential informants'\r\n\ninformation,  reliability,  or   personal  knowledge  of  the\r\n\nmatter.  Second, Figueroa  never asked the disciplinary board\r\n\nto  let  Ward review  the  confidential  report,  nor did  he\r\n\npresent  that issue  to the  district court.14   Accordingly,\r\n\nthis issue is not  even properly before us.

He also reported that Figueroa had worked in the\r\n\nkitchen  at  the time  the  ladle  disappeared.   On  appeal,\r\n\nFigueroa denies that he  ever worked in the kitchen  and that\r\n\nhe ever had access  to the soup  ladle.  At the  disciplinary\r\n\nhearing, however, Figueroa acknowledged that he had worked in\r\n\nthe kitchen.  He also indicated that he had heard that a soup\r\n\nladle was missing, but denied that he had been working in the\r\n\nkitchen at  the  time  the  ladle  disappeared.    Thus,  the\r\n\nundisputed evidence  before the  board was that  Figueroa had\r\n\nworked  in the kitchen and that a  soup ladle was missing.  A\r\n\ncontroversy   existed  on  the   important  question  whether\r\n\nFigueroa  had worked  in the  kitchen at  the time  the ladle\r\n\ndisappeared.  On that  point, the board obviously discredited\r\n\nFigueroa,  choosing  to  believe  the  results  of   Forgue's\r\n\ninvestigation.   On review, neither we nor the district court\r\n\nmay  revisit the  board's decision  not to  credit Figueroa's\r\n\ntestimony.   Cf.

Remaining Claims\r                                          \r\n\n          Figueroa  complains that defendants  failed to give\r\n\nhim a copy  of the  disciplinary hearing tape  in advance  of\r\n\ntrial as ordered  by the  district court.   Figueroa did  not\r\n\nbring that fact to the court's attention until the day of the\r\n\ntrial.    When he  did so,  the court  recessed the  trial to\r\n\npermit the parties to listen to the tape.  After the  parties\r\n\nhad listened to the  tape, the court asked Figueroa if he was\r\n\nready  to proceed.   Figueroa said that he  was and the trial\r\n\nwas   conducted   without   any   subsequent   objection   by\r\n\nFigueroa.16   The  trial transcript  shows that  Figueroa was\r\n\nfamiliar with  the contents of the  disciplinary hearing tape\r\n\nand knew what  had gone on  at the hearing.   Nothing in  the\r\n\ntranscript suggests that his inability  to listen to the tape\r\n\nin  advance had  prejudiced his  presentation of  evidence at\r\n\ntrial.  Under those circumstances, his claim is meritless.  \r\n\n          In an  \"Addendum\" to his  appellate brief, Figueroa\r\n\nclaims that Officer Forgue  sat on the disciplinary board  in\r\n\nviolation  of the Morris Rules.  See Morris v. Travisono, 499\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.

It requires only that inmates be given written notice of the charges against them at least 24 hours before the disciplinary hearing.  See Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 564 (1974).  This court has said that delivering a disciplinary report describing the charges against an inmate to the inmate meets that requirement.  See Langton v. Berman, 667 F.2d 231, 234 (1st Cir. 1981).  Since Figueroa does not dispute that he received a copy of the disciplinary report describing the charge against him two days before the disciplinary hearing, the district court correctly concluded that the notice given to Figueroa satisfied due process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Provision of Interpreter</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa alleges that he should have been given a Spanish-speaking counselor to assist him at the disciplinary hearing rather than an English-speaking counselor.  He acknowledges that he understands English, except for an occasional word, but says he does not speak English well and so could not participate \"fully\" in the hearing.  (His spoken English can be hard to understand, as the hearing and trial transcripts show.)  At trial, Figueroa said that he had asked both Jack Ward, his English-speaking counselor, and Captain Andrew Anderson, the chairman of the disciplinary board, for Maria Pezza's assistance, but was told that she was unavailable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Figueroa wanted her to assist him at the hearing because she could explain words he did not understand and she would have \"defend[ed]\" him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that no due process violation occurred here.  In part, Figueroa seems to have hoped that Pezza could have presented his case more persuasively to the disciplinary board than he did.  In other words, Pezza would have been useful to him as an advocate.  In Wolff, the Supreme Court held that inmates do not have a right to counsel in disciplinary proceedings, 418 U.S. at 570, a position it confirmed in Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 315 (1976).  The Court suggested, however, that illiterate inmates or inmates with complex cases should be able to \"seek the aid of a fellow inmate, or ... to have adequate substitute aid in the form of help from the staff....\"  See Wolff, 418 U.S. at 570.  Assuming that Figueroa should have been treated as an illiterate inmate, any right that he may have had to staff assistance under Wolff was satisfied when Ward was assigned to help him.  In addition, nothing in the record suggests that any deficiency in Figueroa's English adversely affected the disciplinary proceedings.  As the transcript of the hearing confirms, Figueroa understands spoken English.  Despite sometimes unclear syntax, he can also make himself understood in English.  At the hearing, he denied his guilt, explained why he wanted to call Captain Brodeur as a witness, challenged his lack of access to confidential reports, and denied that he had been working in the prison kitchen at the time the alleged murder weapon disappeared.  Furthermore, Ward appeared with him at the hearing and, according to Figueroa's post-trial brief, participated in questioning Investigating Officer Joseph Forgue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Figueroa presented his own case and the transcript does not reflect that he ever sought Ward's aid in making his presentation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Moreover, Figueroa testified that Anderson and Ward had told him that Pezza was unavailable, but does not allege any unconditional denial of the assistance of a Spanish- speaking counselor.  Although his testimony may suggest that he was told to proceed with the hearing or to proceed with Ward as his counselor,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> he apparently did not actually ask prison officials to postpone his hearing until Pezza was available.  Anderson testified at trial that he had never denied any inmate the counselor of his choice and that he had postponed hearings if the inmate's preferred counselor was absent.  We therefore affirm the district court's determination that defendants did not violate Figueroa's constitutional rights by not appointing a Spanish-speaking counselor or interpreter to aid him at the hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Denial of Witnesses</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Figueroa, he should have been permitted to call as witnesses at his disciplinary hearing Captain Brodeur, the correction officer Figueroa allegedly intended to murder;  an Officer Fletcher, who apparently investigated the alleged murder plot and/or prepared the disciplinary report against Figueroa;  and two inmates, Larry Botton (also given as Boton or Baton in the record) and Gary Ortiz.  At the hearing, Figueroa stated that he wanted to call Brodeur to confirm that he and Brodeur had had no problems with each other.  On appeal, Figueroa says that, if Fletcher, Botton and Ortiz had appeared at the hearing, their \"testimony could have brought forth new or previous[ly] unsolicited facts.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disciplinary hearing and again at trial, Captain Anderson, the chairman of the disciplinary board, explained the board's determination that testimony by Brodeur about his relationship with Figueroa would not be relevant.  Although lack of animosity might normally seem relevant in determining whether one individual might be motivated to kill another, Officer Joseph Forgue, who had investigated the charge against Figueroa, explained at the hearing that such evidence would be irrelevant in Figueroa's case.  According to Forgue, it was \"well known\" in the prison that there was a \"contract\" on Brodeur's life and that confidential informants had reported that Figueroa had \"pick[ed] up\" that contract.  For that reason, an inmate would not \"have to have a problem with someone to stick them.  That's irrelevant whether you had a problem with them or not.\"  Given Forgue's statement, the board did not abuse its discretion in not calling Brodeur as a witness.  See Smith v. Massachusetts Department of Correction, 936 F.2d 1390, 1399-1400 (1st Cir. 1991) (applying abuse of discretion standard in reviewing disciplinary board's failure to call inmate witnesses);  Turner v. Caspari, 38 F.3d 388, 391, 392 (8th Cir. 1994) (noting that prison disciplinary boards have great discretion to decline to call inmate witnesses whose testimony would be irrelevant or unnecessary).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is there merit in Figueroa's claims respecting Botton and Ortiz.  The transcript of the disciplinary hearing shows that he never asked the board to call them as witnesses, and so the board obviously did not violate his due process rights in not calling them.  See Harrison v. Seay, 856 F. Supp. 1275, 1281 (W.D. Tenn. 1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Figueroa alleges that Officer Fletcher's testimony \"could have brought forth new or previous[ly] unsolicited facts.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The record indicates that Figueroa had told the board that Fletcher would either offer favorable character testimony or would corroborate Figueroa's trouble- free relationship with Brodeur.  The disciplinary transcript indicates that Figueroa told the board that Fletcher would testify that Figueroa was \"not of that type of character\" and that the board regarded his testimony to be irrelevant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  According to Anderson's trial testimony, Figueroa had said that Fletcher would testify that Figueroa and Brodeur had not had any problems with each other.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Under the circumstances, the court did not err in concluding that the board had not violated due process by declining to call Fletcher as a witness.  As noted above, testimony about Figueroa's relationship with Brodeur was irrelevant and unnecessary.  In addition, without further specifics, the simple testimony that Figueroa was not the \"type\" of person to commit murder would not have impugned the confidential informants' clear identification of Figueroa as the inmate who planned to kill Brodeur.  See Graham v. Baughman, 772 F.2d 441, 445 (8th Cir. 1985) (prison officials who had to determine whether an inmate had started a fire outside of his cell were well within their discretion in concluding that character evidence was either irrelevant or unnecessary).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Sufficiency of Evidence and Related Claims</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa claimed below that the board's decision was not supported by substantial evidence.  The district court concluded that its task in a section 1983 action alleging a violation of federal due process was to determine whether \"some evidence\" supported the board's decision, citing Superintendent, Massachusetts Correctional Institution v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445 (1985).  In Hill, the Supreme Court held that federal due process is satisfied if \"some evidence\" in the record supports a disciplinary decision, defining that term to mean \"any evidence in the record that could support the conclusion reached by the disciplinary board.\"  Id. at 455-56.  Using that standard, the district court found that \"some evidence\" supported the board's decision, and we agree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  We also agree with the court that the Hill standard describes the relevant federal due process standard even though state law imposes a stricter evidentiary standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  See id. at 456 (\"We decline to adopt a more stringent evidentiary standard [than the some evidence standard] as a constitutional requirement.\");  see Goff v. Dailey, 991 F.2d 1437, 1441 n.9 (8th Cir.)  (state regulations may provide more protection than the federal Constitution, but cannot raise the standard of due process under the Constitution), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 564 (1993);  but see Brown v. Fauver, 819 F.2d 395, 399 n.4 (3d Cir. 1987) (Hill did not establish whether the Constitution requires a particular burden of proof in disciplinary proceedings, but spoke only to appellate review standards).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In connection with his argument that the board's decision was not supported by substantial evidence, Figueroa asserts two additional claims, which we consider in turn.  First, he complains that neither he nor his counselor, Jack Ward, had access to a confidential investigative report based on information provided by unidentified informants \"as did the disciplinary board.\"  Figueroa recognizes that granting him access to the confidential report \"could have violated institutional security and other investigations.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  But he claims that Ward could have reviewed the report and inquired into the informants' mutual corroboration, personal knowledge of the matter, and reliability.  His point seems to be that Ward might have uncovered evidence discrediting the informants or their information, so that Ward's inability to see the report not only violated Figueroa's due process rights, but should also preclude the district court from considering evidence deriving from the report.  Under the circumstances present here, we disagree.  First, as the chairman of the disciplinary board testified at trial, the board did not rely on the confidential report in finding Figueroa guilty;  it did not even see that report.  Although the report had been attached to Figueroa's disciplinary report at one time, it had been removed before the hearing.  Instead, the board relied solely on Officer Forgue's statements at the hearing describing the nature and reliability of the informants' information.  (According to Anderson's trial testimony, Forgue authored the confidential report).  Figueroa was present at the hearing and obviously knew what Forgue had said.  Accordingly, he was in exactly the same position as the board in terms of his familiarity with the evidence against him.  Figueroa was permitted to speak freely during the hearing and had the right to cross-examine Forgue.  See Morris v. Travisono, 499 F. Supp. 149, 169 (D.R.I. 1980) (Disciplinary Procedures, Sec. III.C.4:  An inmate has \"the right to call a reasonable number of witnesses, both adverse and favorable and examine said witnesses.\").  At no time during the hearing did Figueroa attempt to question Forgue about the confidential informants' information, reliability, or personal knowledge of the matter.  Second, Figueroa never asked the disciplinary board to let Ward review the confidential report, nor did he present that issue to the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Accordingly, this issue is not even properly before us.  Finally, prison officials have no general federal due process obligation to disclose confidential reports to staff members assisting inmates charged with disciplinary infractions.  See Mendoza v. Miller, 779 F.2d 1287, 1298 (7th Cir. 1985) (declining to adopt a general rule that inmate counsel should have access to confidential investigative reports used in disciplinary hearings), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1142 (1986);  Freitas v. Auger, 837 F.2d 806, 810 n.7 (8th Cir. 1988) (rejecting an inmate's contention that the court should have made confidential reports available to him or his attorney after the informants were transferred to a different prison);  see also Wagner v. Williford, 804 F.2d 1012, 1017-18 (7th Cir. 1986), and on appeal after remand Wagner v. Henman, 902 F.2d 578, 581 (7th Cir. 1990) (both confirming that there is no \"general rule\" in the Seventh Circuit that confidential reports may be disclosed to inmates' counsel and describing the circumstances under which a \"limited release of redacted material information\" to counsel might be possible);  White v. Nix, 43 F.3d 374, 378 (8th Cir. 1994) (concluding that case law concerning the discovery of confidential investigative files during prison disciplinary hearings \"uniformly\" sets certain conditions on an inmate's counsel's access to such files).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Figueroa challenges the district court's reliance on evidence that the intended murder weapon was a sharpened soup ladle which had disappeared from the prison kitchen at the time Figueroa worked there.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  At the hearing, Officer Forgue told the board that confidential informants had reported that the murder weapon was a honed soup ladle.  He also reported that Figueroa had worked in the kitchen at the time the ladle disappeared.  On appeal, Figueroa denies that he ever worked in the kitchen and that he ever had access to the soup ladle.  At the disciplinary hearing, however, Figueroa acknowledged that he had worked in the kitchen.  He also indicated that he had heard that a soup ladle was missing, but denied that he had been working in the kitchen at the time the ladle disappeared.  Thus, the undisputed evidence before the board was that Figueroa had worked in the kitchen and that a soup ladle was missing.  A controversy existed on the important question whether Figueroa had worked in the kitchen at the time the ladle disappeared.  On that point, the board obviously discredited Figueroa, choosing to believe the results of Forgue's investigation.  On review, neither we nor the district court may revisit the board's decision not to credit Figueroa's testimony.  Cf. Hill, 472 U.S. at 455 (indicating that a disciplinary board's factual findings are not subject to \"second-guessing\" upon review, nor is the reviewing court required to independently assess the credibility of witnesses or weigh the evidence);  Turner v. Scroggy, 831 F.2d 135, 140 (6th Cir. 1987) (\"it is not our task nor the magistrate's to substitute credibility determinations contrary to the [disciplinary] committee's ultimate finding\") (majority opinion);  Harrison, 856 F. Supp. at 1280 (\"Reexamination of a prison disciplinary board's credibility choices is beyond the scope of federal court review of disciplinary proceedings.\")  (citing Turner v. Scroggy ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">5. Remaining Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa complains that defendants failed to give him a copy of the disciplinary hearing tape in advance of trial as ordered by the district court.  Figueroa did not bring that fact to the court's attention until the day of the trial.  When he did so, the court recessed the trial to permit the parties to listen to the tape.  After the parties had listened to the tape, the court asked Figueroa if he was ready to proceed.  Figueroa said that he was and the trial was conducted without any subsequent objection by Figueroa.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  The trial transcript shows that Figueroa was familiar with the contents of the disciplinary hearing tape and knew what had gone on at the hearing.  Nothing in the transcript suggests that his inability to listen to the tape in advance had prejudiced his presentation of evidence at trial.  Under those circumstances, his claim is meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an \"Addendum\" to his appellate brief, Figueroa claims that Officer Forgue sat on the disciplinary board in violation of the Morris Rules.  See Morris v. Travisono, 499 F. Supp. at 169 (Disciplinary Procedures, Sec. III.B:  \"Any officer who initiates a violation report or who investigates and reviews the initiating officer's report is not eligible to sit on the disciplinary board to hear that case.\").  This claim, which is apparently based on an inadvertent error in the district court's description of the facts, was not presented below and is clearly refuted by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On appeal, Figueroa appears to claim as well that failure to provide 24-hour advance notice of the hearing violated the Morris Rules, which are regulations governing the discipline and classification of inmates at the state facility where Figueroa is incarcerated and which have the force and effect of state law.  See Rodi v. Ventetuolo, 941 F.2d 22, 26-28 (1st Cir. 1991).  The version of the Morris Rules at issue is appended to Morris v. Travisono, 499 F. Supp. 149 (D.R.I. 1980).  Figueroa's state law claims are not before us.  Although his complaint asserted both state and federal claims, in his pre-trial memorandum Figueroa argued only his due process claims, relying on cases discussing federal due process.  Without objection by Figueroa, the district court issued a pre-trial order limiting the evidence to be presented at trial to the federal due process issues.  The court's decision resolved only the federal due process claims.  Since the court never asserted pendent jurisdiction over Figueroa's state law claims and did not resolve those claims, Figueroa remains free to bring his state law claims in state court if not otherwise barred from doing so by state law, e.g., by any applicable statute of limitations</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court apparently discredited Figueroa's testimony at trial that he had asked for Pezza's assistance, relying on the transcript of the disciplinary hearing which did not record any such request.  Anderson testified that Figueroa had never asked him for a Spanish-speaking counselor or interpreter and that he would have readily granted any such request.  However, Figueroa testified that he had also asked Ward for Pezza's assistance</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Ward's participation is not evident from the hearing transcript which apparently incorrectly attributes his questions to disciplinary board members</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> At trial, Figueroa stated that Ward had been of no help to him, but he does not suggest that Ward's alleged failure to help him is actionable under section 1983.  In any event, because there is no right to counsel at prison disciplinary hearings, an inmate has no cause of action for a staff assistant's allegedly ineffective assistance.  See Bostic v. Carlson, 884 F.2d 1267, 1274 (9th Cir. 1989);  Harrison v. Seay, 856 F. Supp. 1275, 1281 (W.D. Tenn. 1994);  cf.  Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 755 (1991) (because an inmate has no right to counsel to collaterally attack his conviction, he has no claim for ineffective assistance of such counsel)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Figueroa testified as follows:  \"I ask [Ward and Anderson] if I can have Spanish counsellor, specific, Maria Pezza.  I was told that Maria Pezza was embarcation at the time, [inaudible].  I have to proceed.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Brodeur's testimony would also have been cumulative and was unnecessary for that reason.  Figueroa told the board that he had had no problems with Brodeur, and Forgue agreed, telling the board that Figueroa had no motive to kill Brodeur that he knew of and that, as Figueroa had said, he and Brodeur did not appear to have problems with each other</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In his pre-trial memorandum, Figueroa told the district court that Botton would testify at trial that Figueroa had been \"set up\" by a correction officer and another inmate and that Ortiz would testify that an Officer Martinez and inmate Armando Perez had plotted to set him up.  The district court would not let Botton and Ortiz testify, ruling, correctly, that the question before the court was not whether Figueroa was actually innocent of the charge against him.  On appeal, Figueroa appears to have abandoned the claim that Botton and Ortiz would have testified that he had been set up</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In his post-trial memorandum, Figueroa stated that Fletcher was the original investigating officer, that another inmate had been under investigation, and that Fletcher would testify that Figueroa was the \"wrong man.\"  In his pre-trial memorandum, however, Figueroa had shown no interest in calling Fletcher as a witness, proffering instead the distinctly different theory described above that another inmate and a correction officer had set him up.  On appeal, he has obviously abandoned his claim that Fletcher would have testified that a different inmate than Figueroa had plotted to murder Brodeur</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The disciplinary hearing transcript shows that Figueroa asked to call Fletcher as a witness, but does not record any discussion of the substance of Fletcher's testimony.  That discussion apparently occurred, however.  The transcript indicates that Figueroa assented to Anderson's statement that \"you request ... Officer Fletcher to come up here to testify that you're not of that type of character\" and his explanation that the proposed testimony was irrelevant.  In addition, in his appellate statement of facts, Figueroa states that he told the board that Fletcher would have testified that he was not the \"type of person who would commit the act alleged.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Although Figueroa objected to Anderson's statement, he did not explain his basis for disagreeing and did not tell the court that Fletcher would have given different testimony</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The district court cited the following facts:  that different informants, who had had no contact with each other, had identified Figueroa as the inmate who was to stab Brodeur;  that each informant's information corroborated the information proffered by the other informant;  that the informants had personal knowledge of the matter and had provided accurate information in the past;  that there was evidence that the informants were credible;  that the weapon the informants claimed Figueroa intended to use-a soup ladle honed to a knife blade-had disappeared from the kitchen when Figueroa worked in the kitchen;  and, finally, that Figueroa had offered no rebuttal information or any exonerating evidence</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Accordingly, we do not decide whether substantial evidence in the record supported the board's decision</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> Therefore, Figueroa is apparently not challenging the district court's finding that he was not entitled to see the confidential report which apparently identified at least one of the inmates who had reported that Figueroa had planned to kill Brodeur.  It is well established that inmates have no federal due process right to obtain evidence which could identify confidential informants.  See, e.g., Langton, 667 F.2d at 235 (rejecting an inmate's contention that he had the right to cross-examine a confidential informant or review the informant's statement because Wolff left such matters to prison officials' discretion);  Mendoza v. Miller, 779 F.2d 1287, 1294 (7th Cir. 1985) (stating that Wolff and Seventh Circuit cases establish \"unequivocally\" that an inmate does not have a due process right to be informed of the identity of confidential informants), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1142 (1986);  Zimmerlee v.

Sec. 1983 when it found him guilty of planning to murder Captain Ronald Brodeur, a correction officer.  We affirm.  Since the facts have been described in the district court's opinion, we do not repeat them here except as is necessary to explain our affirmance.  We turn immediately to Figueroa's contentions on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Notice of Time of Disciplinary Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa claims that he was not given a required 24- hour notice of his disciplinary hearing and that delivery of the disciplinary report to him two days before the hearing was insufficient notice.  Federal law does not require 24-hour advance notice of a disciplinary hearing, however.  It requires only that inmates be given written notice of the charges against them at least 24 hours before the disciplinary hearing.  See Wolff v. McDonnell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span>, 564 (1974).  This court has said that delivering a disciplinary report describing the charges against an inmate to the inmate meets that requirement.  See Langton v. Berman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398207\"><a href=\"/opinion/398207/william-langton-v-louis-berman/\"><span class=\"volume\">667</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 234 (1st Cir. 1981).  Since Figueroa does not dispute that he received a copy of the disciplinary report describing the charge against him two days before the disciplinary hearing, the district court correctly concluded that the notice given to Figueroa satisfied due process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Provision of Interpreter</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa alleges that he should have been given a Spanish-speaking counselor to assist him at the disciplinary hearing rather than an English-speaking counselor.  He acknowledges that he understands English, except for an occasional word, but says he does not speak English well and so could not participate \"fully\" in the hearing.  (His spoken English can be hard to understand, as the hearing and trial transcripts show.)  At trial, Figueroa said that he had asked both Jack Ward, his English-speaking counselor, and Captain Andrew Anderson, the chairman of the disciplinary board, for Maria Pezza's assistance, but was told that she was unavailable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Figueroa wanted her to assist him at the hearing because she could explain words he did not understand and she would have \"defend[ed]\" him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that no due process violation occurred here.  In part, Figueroa seems to have hoped that Pezza could have presented his case more persuasively to the disciplinary board than he did.  In other words, Pezza would have been useful to him as an advocate.  In Wolff, the Supreme Court held that inmates do not have a right to counsel in disciplinary <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">proceedings,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span>, a position it confirmed in Baxter v. Palmigiano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109429\"><a href=\"/opinion/109429/baxter-v-palmigiano/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 315 (1976).  The Court suggested, however, that illiterate inmates or inmates with complex cases should be able to \"seek the aid of a fellow inmate, or ... to have adequate substitute aid in the form of help from the staff....\"  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Wolff,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span>.  Assuming that Figueroa should have been treated as an illiterate inmate, any right that he may have had to staff assistance under Wolff was satisfied when Ward was assigned to help him.  In addition, nothing in the record suggests that any deficiency in Figueroa's English adversely affected the disciplinary proceedings.  As the transcript of the hearing confirms, Figueroa understands spoken English.  Despite sometimes unclear syntax, he can also make himself understood in English.  At the hearing, he denied his guilt, explained why he wanted to call Captain Brodeur as a witness, challenged his lack of access to confidential reports, and denied that he had been working in the prison kitchen at the time the alleged murder weapon disappeared.  Furthermore, Ward appeared with him at the hearing and, according to Figueroa's post-trial brief, participated in questioning Investigating Officer Joseph Forgue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Figueroa presented his own case and the transcript does not reflect that he ever sought Ward's aid in making his presentation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Moreover, Figueroa testified that Anderson and Ward had told him that Pezza was unavailable, but does not allege any unconditional denial of the assistance of a Spanish- speaking counselor.  Although his testimony may suggest that he was told to proceed with the hearing or to proceed with Ward as his counselor,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> he apparently did not actually ask prison officials to postpone his hearing until Pezza was available.  Anderson testified at trial that he had never denied any inmate the counselor of his choice and that he had postponed hearings if the inmate's preferred counselor was absent.  We therefore affirm the district court's determination that defendants did not violate Figueroa's constitutional rights by not appointing a Spanish-speaking counselor or interpreter to aid him at the hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Denial of Witnesses</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Figueroa, he should have been permitted to call as witnesses at his disciplinary hearing Captain Brodeur, the correction officer Figueroa allegedly intended to murder;  an Officer Fletcher, who apparently investigated the alleged murder plot and/or prepared the disciplinary report against Figueroa;  and two inmates, Larry Botton (also given as Boton or Baton in the record) and Gary Ortiz.  At the hearing, Figueroa stated that he wanted to call Brodeur to confirm that he and Brodeur had had no problems with each other.  On appeal, Figueroa says that, if Fletcher, Botton and Ortiz had appeared at the hearing, their \"testimony could have brought forth new or previous[ly] unsolicited facts.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disciplinary hearing and again at trial, Captain Anderson, the chairman of the disciplinary board, explained the board's determination that testimony by Brodeur about his relationship with Figueroa would not be relevant.  Although lack of animosity might normally seem relevant in determining whether one individual might be motivated to kill another, Officer Joseph Forgue, who had investigated the charge against Figueroa, explained at the hearing that such evidence would be irrelevant in Figueroa's case.  According to Forgue, it was \"well known\" in the prison that there was a \"contract\" on Brodeur's life and that confidential informants had reported that Figueroa had \"pick[ed] up\" that contract.  For that reason, an inmate would not \"have to have a problem with someone to stick them.  That's irrelevant whether you had a problem with them or not.\"  Given Forgue's statement, the board did not abuse its discretion in not calling Brodeur as a witness.  See Smith v. Massachusetts Department of Correction, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563775\"><a href=\"/opinion/563775/guy-l-smith-jr-v-massachusetts-department-of-correction/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1390</span></a></span>, 1399-1400 (1st Cir. 1991) (applying abuse of discretion standard in reviewing disciplinary board's failure to call inmate witnesses);  Turner v. Caspari, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"680756\"><a href=\"/opinion/680756/shon-turner-v-paul-caspari-mary-brundage-ann-austermann-major-j-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span>, 391, 392 (8th Cir. 1994) (noting that prison disciplinary boards have great discretion to decline to call inmate witnesses whose testimony would be irrelevant or unnecessary).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is there merit in Figueroa's claims respecting Botton and Ortiz.  The transcript of the disciplinary hearing shows that he never asked the board to call them as witnesses, and so the board obviously did not violate his due process rights in not calling them.  See Harrison v. Seay, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1681502\"><a href=\"/opinion/1681502/harrison-v-seay/\"><span class=\"volume\">856</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1275</span></a></span>, 1281 (W.D. Tenn. 1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Figueroa alleges that Officer Fletcher's testimony \"could have brought forth new or previous[ly] unsolicited facts.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The record indicates that Figueroa had told the board that Fletcher would either offer favorable character testimony or would corroborate Figueroa's trouble- free relationship with Brodeur.  The disciplinary transcript indicates that Figueroa told the board that Fletcher would testify that Figueroa was \"not of that type of character\" and that the board regarded his testimony to be irrelevant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  According to Anderson's trial testimony, Figueroa had said that Fletcher would testify that Figueroa and Brodeur had not had any problems with each other.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Under the circumstances, the court did not err in concluding that the board had not violated due process by declining to call Fletcher as a witness.  As noted above, testimony about Figueroa's relationship with Brodeur was irrelevant and unnecessary.  In addition, without further specifics, the simple testimony that Figueroa was not the \"type\" of person to commit murder would not have impugned the confidential informants' clear identification of Figueroa as the inmate who planned to kill Brodeur.  See Graham v. Baughman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457905\"><a href=\"/opinion/457905/james-p-graham-v-jack-baughman-former-warden-iowa-state-penitentiary/\"><span class=\"volume\">772</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span>, 445 (8th Cir. 1985) (prison officials who had to determine whether an inmate had started a fire outside of his cell were well within their discretion in concluding that character evidence was either irrelevant or unnecessary).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Sufficiency of Evidence and Related Claims</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa claimed below that the board's decision was not supported by substantial evidence.  The district court concluded that its task in a section 1983 action alleging a violation of federal due process was to determine whether \"some evidence\" supported the board's decision, citing Superintendent, Massachusetts Correctional Institution v. Hill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111476\"><a href=\"/opinion/111476/superintendent-mass-correctional-institution-at-walpole-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span> </a></span>(1985).  In Hill, the Supreme Court held that federal due process is satisfied if \"some evidence\" in the record supports a disciplinary decision, defining that term to mean \"any evidence in the record that could support the conclusion reached by the disciplinary board.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111476\"><a href=\"/opinion/111476/superintendent-mass-correctional-institution-at-walpole-v-hill/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 455-56. </a></span> Using that standard, the district court found that \"some evidence\" supported the board's decision, and we agree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  We also agree with the court that the Hill standard describes the relevant federal due process standard even though state law imposes a stricter evidentiary standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111476\"><a href=\"/opinion/111476/superintendent-mass-correctional-institution-at-walpole-v-hill/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 456 </a></span>(\"We decline to adopt a more stringent evidentiary standard [than the some evidence standard] as a constitutional requirement.\");  see Goff v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span> </span>(1993);  but see Brown v. Fauver, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488735\"><a href=\"/opinion/488735/ralph-brown-v-william-h-fauver-commissioner-of-corrections-elaine/\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">395</span></a></span>, 399 n.4 (3d Cir. 1987) (Hill did not establish whether the Constitution requires a particular burden of proof in disciplinary proceedings, but spoke only to appellate review standards).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In connection with his argument that the board's decision was not supported by substantial evidence, Figueroa asserts two additional claims, which we consider in turn.  First, he complains that neither he nor his counselor, Jack Ward, had access to a confidential investigative report based on information provided by unidentified informants \"as did the disciplinary board.\"  Figueroa recognizes that granting him access to the confidential report \"could have violated institutional security and other investigations.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  But he claims that Ward could have reviewed the report and inquired into the informants' mutual corroboration, personal knowledge of the matter, and reliability.  His point seems to be that Ward might have uncovered evidence discrediting the informants or their information, so that Ward's inability to see the report not only violated Figueroa's due process rights, but should also preclude the district court from considering evidence deriving from the report.  Under the circumstances present here, we disagree.  First, as the chairman of the disciplinary board testified at trial, the board did not rely on the confidential report in finding Figueroa guilty;  it did not even see that report.  Although the report had been attached to Figueroa's disciplinary report at one time, it had been removed before the hearing.  Instead, the board relied solely on Officer Forgue's statements at the hearing describing the nature and reliability of the informants' information.  (According to Anderson's trial testimony, Forgue authored the confidential report).  Figueroa was present at the hearing and obviously knew what Forgue had said.  Accordingly, he was in exactly the same position as the board in terms of his familiarity with the evidence against him.  Figueroa was permitted to speak freely during the hearing and had the right to cross-examine Forgue.  See Morris v. Travisono, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1871633\"><a href=\"/opinion/1871633/morris-v-travisono/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span>, 169 (D.R.I. 1980) (Disciplinary Procedures, Sec. III.C.4:  An inmate has \"the right to call a reasonable number of witnesses, both adverse and favorable and examine said witnesses.\").  At no time during the hearing did Figueroa attempt to question Forgue about the confidential informants' information, reliability, or personal knowledge of the matter.  Second, Figueroa never asked the disciplinary board to let Ward review the confidential report, nor did he present that issue to the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Accordingly, this issue is not even properly before us.  Finally, prison officials have no general federal due process obligation to disclose confidential reports to staff members assisting inmates charged with disciplinary infractions.  See Mendoza v. Miller, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"462502\"><a href=\"/opinion/462502/charles-mendoza-v-harold-g-miller-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">779</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1287</span></a></span>, 1298 (7th Cir. 1985) (declining to adopt a general rule that inmate counsel should have access to confidential investigative reports used in disciplinary hearings), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1142</span> </span>(1986);  Freitas v.

He also reported that Figueroa had worked in the kitchen at the time the ladle disappeared.  On appeal, Figueroa denies that he ever worked in the kitchen and that he ever had access to the soup ladle.  At the disciplinary hearing, however, Figueroa acknowledged that he had worked in the kitchen.  He also indicated that he had heard that a soup ladle was missing, but denied that he had been working in the kitchen at the time the ladle disappeared.  Thus, the undisputed evidence before the board was that Figueroa had worked in the kitchen and that a soup ladle was missing.  A controversy existed on the important question whether Figueroa had worked in the kitchen at the time the ladle disappeared.  On that point, the board obviously discredited Figueroa, choosing to believe the results of Forgue's investigation.  On review, neither we nor the district court may revisit the board's decision not to credit Figueroa's testimony.

Figueroa did not bring that fact to the court's attention until the day of the trial.  When he did so, the court recessed the trial to permit the parties to listen to the tape.  After the parties had listened to the tape, the court asked Figueroa if he was ready to proceed.  Figueroa said that he was and the trial was conducted without any subsequent objection by Figueroa.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  The trial transcript shows that Figueroa was familiar with the contents of the disciplinary hearing tape and knew what had gone on at the hearing.  Nothing in the transcript suggests that his inability to listen to the tape in advance had prejudiced his presentation of evidence at trial.

See Rodi v. Ventetuolo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566305\"><a href=\"/opinion/566305/stephen-gerard-rodi-v-donald-r-ventetuolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 26-28 (1st Cir. 1991).  The version of the Morris Rules at issue is appended to Morris v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span> </a></span>(D.R.I. 1980).  Figueroa's state law claims are not before us.  Although his complaint asserted both state and federal claims, in his pre-trial memorandum Figueroa argued only his due process claims, relying on cases discussing federal due process.  Without objection by Figueroa, the district court issued a pre-trial order limiting the evidence to be presented at trial to the federal due process issues.  The court's decision resolved only the federal due process claims.  Since the court never asserted pendent jurisdiction over Figueroa's state law claims and did not resolve those claims, Figueroa remains free to bring his state law claims in state court if not otherwise barred from doing so by state law, e.g., by any applicable statute of limitations</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court apparently discredited Figueroa's testimony at trial that he had asked for Pezza's assistance, relying on the transcript of the disciplinary hearing which did not record any such request.  Anderson testified that Figueroa had never asked him for a Spanish-speaking counselor or interpreter and that he would have readily granted any such request.  However, Figueroa testified that he had also asked Ward for Pezza's assistance</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Ward's participation is not evident from the hearing transcript which apparently incorrectly attributes his questions to disciplinary board members</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> At trial, Figueroa stated that Ward had been of no help to him, but he does not suggest that Ward's alleged failure to help him is actionable under section 1983.  In any event, because there is no right to counsel at prison disciplinary hearings, an inmate has no cause of action for a staff assistant's allegedly ineffective assistance.  See Bostic v.

I was told that Maria Pezza was embarcation at the time, [inaudible].  I have to proceed.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Brodeur's testimony would also have been cumulative and was unnecessary for that reason.  Figueroa told the board that he had had no problems with Brodeur, and Forgue agreed, telling the board that Figueroa had no motive to kill Brodeur that he knew of and that, as Figueroa had said, he and Brodeur did not appear to have problems with each other</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In his pre-trial memorandum, Figueroa told the district court that Botton would testify at trial that Figueroa had been \"set up\" by a correction officer and another inmate and that Ortiz would testify that an Officer Martinez and inmate Armando Perez had plotted to set him up.  The district court would not let Botton and Ortiz testify, ruling, correctly, that the question before the court was not whether Figueroa was actually innocent of the charge against him.  On appeal, Figueroa appears to have abandoned the claim that Botton and Ortiz would have testified that he had been set up</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In his post-trial memorandum, Figueroa stated that Fletcher was the original investigating officer, that another inmate had been under investigation, and that Fletcher would testify that Figueroa was the \"wrong man.\"  In his pre-trial memorandum, however, Figueroa had shown no interest in calling Fletcher as a witness, proffering instead the distinctly different theory described above that another inmate and a correction officer had set him up.  On appeal, he has obviously abandoned his claim that Fletcher would have testified that a different inmate than Figueroa had plotted to murder Brodeur</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The disciplinary hearing transcript shows that Figueroa asked to call Fletcher as a witness, but does not record any discussion of the substance of Fletcher's testimony.  That discussion apparently occurred, however.  The transcript indicates that Figueroa assented to Anderson's statement that \"you request ... Officer Fletcher to come up here to testify that you're not of that type of character\" and his explanation that the proposed testimony was irrelevant.  In addition, in his appellate statement of facts, Figueroa states that he told the board that Fletcher would have testified that he was not the \"type of person who would commit the act alleged.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Although Figueroa objected to Anderson's statement, he did not explain his basis for disagreeing and did not tell the court that Fletcher would have given different testimony</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The district court cited the following facts:  that different informants, who had had no contact with each other, had identified Figueroa as the inmate who was to stab Brodeur;  that each informant's information corroborated the information proffered by the other informant;  that the informants had personal knowledge of the matter and had provided accurate information in the past;  that there was evidence that the informants were credible;  that the weapon the informants claimed Figueroa intended to use-a soup ladle honed to a knife blade-had disappeared from the kitchen when Figueroa worked in the kitchen;  and, finally, that Figueroa had offered no rebuttal information or any exonerating evidence</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Accordingly, we do not decide whether substantial evidence in the record supported the board's decision</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> Therefore, Figueroa is apparently not challenging the district court's finding that he was not entitled to see the confidential report which apparently identified at least one of the inmates who had reported that Figueroa had planned to kill Brodeur.  It is well established that inmates have no federal due process right to obtain evidence which could identify confidential informants.
