In this  case, the Sierra  Club\n                          \n\nappeals  from the judgment of the district court declining to\n\nenjoin construction of the central artery/third harbor tunnel\n\nproject in Boston.  It also petitions to review the action of\n\nthe Environmental Protection Agency in approving an amendment\n\nto  Massachusetts  state  regulations  that  bears  upon  the\n\nproject.   We affirm the district court and deny the petition\n\nfor review.\n\n              I. THE FACTS AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n\n     Massachusetts, through its  Department of Public  Works,\n\nhas  begun construction  of a  mammoth project  that includes\n\nrebuilding a  major segment of  Interstate Route 93  that now\n\nruns on a  viaduct through  downtown Boston and  is known  as\n\n\"the central artery.\"  When the central artery/tunnel project\n\nis  completed some  years  from now,  the highway  segment in\n\nquestion will be widened, sunk below ground level, and mostly\n\ncovered.  It  will connect  at the  north with  a new  bridge\n\nacross the Charles River and at the south with a newly  built\n\nthird  harbor  tunnel  running  from South  Boston  to  Logan\n\nAirport in East Boston.\n\n     The depressed and covered portion of the new highway and\n\nthe  tunnel will  be  ventilated by  ducts  and fans  in  six\n\nbuildings located  on the highway  route and near  the tunnel\n\nportals.   Vast amounts of air will be drawn into the covered\n\nhighway  and tunnel, and the mixture of air and motor vehicle\n\n                             -3-\n\nemissions will be  pumped up  through the  six buildings  and\n\nexhausted  through stacks ranging  from 90 to  225 feet high.\n\nStudies  indicate  that  the  project  will  reduce   traffic\n\ncongestion,  increase  average speeds,  and  reduce area-wide\n\ncarbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions.\n\n     The  Sierra  Club,  a  non-profit  environmental  group,\n\nbelieves that whatever the  area-wide effects of the project,\n\nit will create new \"hot spots\" of pollution in certain of the\n\nneighborhoods near  to the six ventilation buildings.  In its\n\nview, pollution  control equipment,  in the nature  of after-\n\nburners,  should be  installed in the  ventilation buildings.\n\nThe federal and  state governments, which have  filed a joint\n\nbrief in this case, deny that any dangerous hot spots will be\n\ncreated,  pointing  to  studies  conducted  as  part  of  the\n\nproject's environmental review.  They also assert that after-\n\nburner  technology  is  not   feasible  because  of  the  low\n\nconcentration of pollutants in the vented air.\n\n     In  March  1991,  the Sierra  Club  and  certain  of its\n\nmembers  who  live  in the  vicinity  of  the central  artery\n\nbrought  suit in district court against a collection of state\n\nand  federal  officials associated  with  the  project.   The\n\ngravamen of the  suit was  the Sierra Club's  claim that  the\n\nventilation buildings  planned  for the  project comprised  a\n\n\"major stationary  source\" of air  pollution as that  term is\n\nused in the  Clean Air Act,  42 U.S.C.    7401, et seq.,  and\n                                                       \n\n                             -4-\n\ncounterpart Massachusetts regulations,  310 C.M.R.   7.00  et\n                                                             \n\nseq.   It is common ground that, if the ventilation buildings\n   \n\nwere so classified,  then the project would  require a permit\n\nor permits from Massachusetts that have not been secured.  To\n\nframe this issue entails a brief description of the statute.\n\n     The Clean  Air Act  enacted a complex  statutory regime,\n\nseveral times amended, to  control and mitigate air pollution\n\nin  the  United States.   Broadly  speaking,  Title I  of the\n\nstatute  regulates stationary sources  of pollution and Title\n\nII regulates mobile sources, most importantly motor vehicles.\n\nFor  specified pollutants, national air quality standards are\n\npromulgated  by  EPA.    42  U.S.C.     7409.    Whether  new\n\nconstruction of polluting facilities is permitted in an area,\n\nand what  kind of controls  are required, depends  on whether\n\nthe area is below  or above the standard for  each pollutant.\n\nPart C,  42 U.S.C.     7470-7492,  governs permits where  the\n\nstandard  has  been attained;  Part  D  applies to  so-called\n\nnonattainment areas.  Id.    7501-7515. \n                        \n\n     In  either  event, the  construction  of  a \"major\"  new\n\nstationary source--normally, one emitting 100 or more tons of\n\npollutant  each  year,  see 42  U.S.C.     7602(j)--generally\n                           \n\nrequires  a permit.  42 U.S.C.     7475(a), 7502(c)(5).1   In\n\n                    \n\n     1The definition  of \"major stationary source\" in section\n7602(j) directly governs permits under part  D where the same\nphrase is  used in  section 7502(c)(5)'s  permit requirement.\nPart  C  requires  permits  for  specified  \"major   emitting\nfacilities,\" in  areas already  in compliance  with pollution\n\n                             -5-\n\nthe case of  Boston, some  of the pollutants  that will  flow\n\nthrough  the proposed ventilation  buildings currently exceed\n\nnational standards so  that new major sources  are subject to\n\nthe more stringent class of limitations; other pollutants are\n\nbelow the standards and less stringent limitations apply.  By\n\nway of example, the Boston area exceeds the national standard\n\nfor  carbon  monoxide, and  to  secure a  permit  the highway\n\nproponents would have to show that a  major stationary source\n\ncan achieve  the \"lowest  achievable emission rate\"  for that\n\npollutant.  42 U.S.C.   7503(a)(2).\n\n     The  Clean Air Act  allocates different responsibilities\n\nto the EPA  on the one hand  and to the states on  the other.\n\nEach  state  is  directed to  adopt  and  submit  to EPA  for\n\napproval a state implementation  plan to achieve and maintain\n\nthe  national standards  established  by EPA.    42 U.S.C.   \n\n7410(a).  See also  id.    7471, 7502.  If the state fails to\n                      \n\nadopt  an  approvable  plan,   the  EPA  must  adopt  federal\n\nregulations   for   the  area.      42   U.S.C.      7410(c).\n\nMassachusetts  has an  approved  state  implementation  plan.\n\nUnder  the Clean Air Act,  \"citizen\" suits may  be brought to\n\nenjoin  a project that requires  a permit under  Parts C or D\n\nbut has not obtained one.  42 U.S.C.   7604(a)(3).\n\n                    \n\nstandards, 42 U.S.C.    7475, 7479,  but--with qualifications\nnot  here  relevant--the  statute instructs  that  the  terms\n\"major stationary  source\" and \"major  emitting facility\"  be\nused interchangeably.  42 U.S.C.   7602(j).\n\n                             -6-\n\n     In  this case, in April 1991 the Sierra Club and certain\n\nof  its  members  sought  a  preliminary  injunction  against\n\nconstruction of the  central artery and tunnel  project.  The\n\nrequest was  denied on July 30, 1991.   After transfer of the\n\ncase to  another judge,  the district court  received further\n\nbriefing  and argument.    On September  16, 1992,  the court\n\ngranted  summary   judgment  in   favor  of   the  government\n\ndefendants, state and  federal, holding that the  ventilation\n\nbuildings did not comprise stationary sources subject to pre-\n\nconstruction permit  requirements.   The Sierra Club  and its\n\nnamed members appealed.\n\n     Shortly before the lawsuit, the Massachusetts Department\n\nof  Environmental   Protection  submitted   to  the   EPA  on\n\nJanuary 30, 1991, a new regulation--regulation 7.38, codified\n\nas  310  C.M.R.     7.38--as  a  proposed  amendment  to  the\n\nMassachusetts  state  implementation plan.    This regulation\n\nseeks  to classify  tunnel  ventilation systems  as \"indirect\n\nsources\" under the Clean  Air Act.   In the early 1970s,  the\n\nEPA  had begun  to  require that  state implementation  plans\n\nregulate  such  facilities  as  parking  lots,  highways  and\n\ngarages that  do not  emit pollutants themselves  but attract\n\nnumbers of polluting vehicles.  Congress responded in 1977 by\n\nbarring the EPA from regulation of what were called \"indirect\n\n                             -7-\n\nsources.\"  42 U.S.C.   7410(a)(5)(B).2   However, Congress at\n\nthe same time gave  the states permission, if they  so chose,\n\nto regulate such indirect sources themselves as part of their\n\nstate implementation plans.  Id.    7410(a)(5)(A), (C).  \n                               \n\n     Massachusetts, exercising this option through regulation\n\n7.38,    proposed   to  regulate  roadway/tunnel  ventilation\n\nsystems   as  indirect   sources.      The  regime   involves\n\ncertification   by  the  builder   that  specified  pollution\n\nstandards will  be met,  and the Department  of Environmental\n\nProtection may  accept, conditionally approve,  or reject the\n\ncertification after  notice and  hearing.   Monitoring  after\n\nconstruction and  periodical renewal  of the certificate  are\n\nrequired.  The  new regulation also  states that the  systems\n\nare not  subject to the pre-construction  permitting required\n\nfor  various  stationary sources  under regulation  7.02, 310\n\nC.M.R.   7.02.\n\n     The Sierra Club opposed  the approval of regulation 7.38\n\nwhen Massachusetts submitted it to the EPA as an amendment to\n\nthe state implementation plan.   The Sierra Club  argued that\n\nthe  effect would  be indirectly  to  relieve the  project at\n\nissue  in this  case of  the more  stringent pre-construction\n\n                    \n\n     2To the  extent that a  highway or other  major indirect\nsource  is federally  assisted, the  EPA retains  some direct\nregulatory authority,  see 42 U.S.C.    7410(a)(5)(B); but no\n                          \nclaim has  been made  that  the project  in this  case is  in\nviolation of any requirements laid down by the EPA under this\nreservation.\n\n                             -8-\n\napproval required of major stationary sources under the Clean\n\nAir  Act  and the  Massachusetts  regulations  that apply  to\n\nstationary  sources.   After  notice  and  receipt of  public\n\ncomments, the EPA on October 8, 1992, published notice of its\n\napproval,  57 Fed. Reg. 46310  (1992).  The  Sierra Club then\n\npetitioned  for review  of  the EPA's  action  in this  court\n\npursuant to 42 U.S.C.   7607(b)(1).\n\n     Because of the  overlapping issues  and common  subject,\n\nthis  court  consolidated  the  two appeals  taken  from  the\n\ndistrict court judgment with the proceeding for direct review\n\nof  the EPA  action.   In this  opinion, we  address first  a\n\njurisdictional  objection raised  by the  federal defendants,\n\nthen statutory issues posed by the appeals from the  district\n\ncourt,  and  finally  the  additional  issues  posed  by  the\n\nMassachusetts regulations  and by the petition  to review the\n\nEPA's action approving regulation 7.38.\n\n                       II. JURISDICTION\n\n     The   federal  defendants  renew  in  this  court  their\n\nargument,  not passed  upon  below, that  the district  court\n\n\"lacked jurisdiction\" over the  complaint against the federal\n\ndefendants.  The  \"citizen suits\" provision of  the Clean Air\n\nAct permits private suits in three defined classes of  cases.\n\nAs  already  noted,  it  explicitly permits  a  private  suit\n\nagainst  anyone   who  \"proposes  to   construct\"  any  major\n\nstationary  source without a permit required by parts C or D.\n\n                             -9-\n\n42 U.S.C.    7604(a)(3).   The federal  defendants deny  that\n\nthey  are proposing to construct  the project or  any part of\n\nit; in other  words, they argue that if anyone  is subject to\n\nsuitunder subsection(a)(3), itis onlyMassachusetts officials.\n\n     The  statute  also  permits  such  citizen  suits  where\n\nemission standards or limitations  are exceeded, or where the\n\nEPA  Administrator has failed to perform an act or duty under\n\nthe Clean  Air Act \"which  is not  discretionary . .  .\"   42\n\nU.S.C.     7604(a)(1),  (2).   As  to  these categories,  the\n\nfederal  defendants argue  that  any violations  of  emission\n\nstandards or  limitations would  be those of  the state,  and\n\nthat the  EPA Administrator  cannot be  sued for  violating a\n\nnon-discretionary duty since enforcement by the Administrator\n\nis inherently a discretionary matter.\n\n     The  Sierra  Club,  responds, unpersuasively,  that  any\n\njurisdictional objection  has been  waived by the  failure of\n\nthe federal defendants to cross appeal.3   More usefully, the\n\nSierra Club urges that  the Administrator did violate a  non-\n\ndiscretionary duty by  failing to take  action to enjoin  the\n\nproject,  and   that  in   any  event  the   Federal  Highway\n\nAdministration  is so  closely  involved in  the funding  and\n\nplanning of this project as to  be effectively a party to its\n\n                    \n\n     3The  jurisdictional  objection  could be  viewed  as an\nalternative  ground   for   sustaining  the   denial  of   an\ninjunction,  dispensing with any need for a cross appeal.  In\nany  event, courts  are  expected to  \"notice\" jurisdictional\nobjections even if no one has raised them.\n\n                             -10-\n\nconstruction.  However, like the government brief, the Sierra\n\nClub's  brief is  silent  as to  what practical  implications\n\nthese questions have in  this case where no one  has disputed\n\nthat   Massachusetts  defendants   can   be   enjoined   from\n\nconstruction if a permit is required.\n\n     Absent some  showing that  the jurisdictional  issue has\n\npractical importance in  this case, we decline to address it.\n\nSince  the Massachusetts  officials are  subject to  suit for\n\nconstructing the project without a permit, the merits must be\n\nreached in  any event.   And since we  resolve the merits  in\n\ntheir  favor,  the jurisdictional  issue  as  to the  federal\n\ndefendants is pretty  close to moot, affecting  only the form\n\nof the  dismissal as to them.   There is  ample precedent for\n\nby-passing jurisdictional objections when  the court can more\n\neasily dismiss on the  merits.  E.g., Norton v.  Mathews, 427\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 524, 532 (1976). \n\n                  III. THE STATUTORY ISSUES\n\n     The  merits  of  the  appeals from  the  district  court\n\njudgment  turn principally  on  a narrow  point of  statutory\n\nconstruction, namely, whether the ventilation  buildings that\n\nwill vent the underground  highway and harbor tunnel comprise\n\na \"stationary source or sources\" within the meaning the Clean\n\nAir Act.  If so labeled, a permit is required; apparently the\n\namount  of pollutant needed to qualify as a \"major\" source is\n\nnot  at issue.    Easily stated,  the  issue is  less  easily\n\n                             -11-\n\nresolved: there is little by way  of statutory definition, no\n\nuseful  judicial precedent or  legislative history offered to\n\nus, and a reasonable possibility that Congress never gave any\n\nthought  to  the  idiosyncracy  posed  by  these  ventilation\n\nbuildings.  \n\n     Starting as one normally does with language, parts C and\n\nD, which contain the pre-construction permit requirements for\n\nmajor stationary sources, originally contained  no definition\n\nof  stationary  source.   Instead  part  D  defines  a \"major\n\nstationary  source\" as  \"any  stationary facility  or source\"\n\nemitting the  specified quantity  of pollutant.   Part C,  by\n\ncross-reference  (see  note  1,   above),  adopts  the   same\n\nlanguage.    Part  A, concerned  with  so-called  performance\n\nstandards, other than air quality standards, did use the term\n\n\"stationary  source\" in 42 U.S.C.   7411, defining it as \"any\n\nbuilding, structure, facility, or installation which emits or\n\nmay  emit any air pollutant.\"  42 U.S.C.    7411(a)(3).  That\n\ndefinition,  however,  was  adopted  \"for  purposes  of  this\n\nsection,\" i.e., section 7411.4  \n              \n\n                    \n\n     4The obscurity  of the  relationship between the  part A\ndefinition just  quoted and the \"major  stationary source\" in\nparts C and D was the subject of comment by the Supreme Court\nin Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,\n                                                             \nInc., 467 U.S. 837,  859-860 (1984).  Yet  another definition\n    \nof stationary  source appears  in, and is  apparently limited\nto, a provision  of part A concerned with  accidental release\nof hazardous substances.  See 42 U.S.C.   7412(r)(2)(C).\n                             \n\n                             -12-\n\n     Thus far the breadth of the  language appears helpful to\n\nthe Sierra Club position, since linguistically  a ventilation\n\nsystem  with a stack could be called a \"facility,\" a \"source\"\n\nor even a \"building.\"  The table tilted back the other way in\n\n1977  when Congress  amended  the Clean  Air  Act to  exclude\n\n\"indirect   sources\"  from   mandatory   coverage  in   state\n\nimplementation  plans.    42  U.S.C.     7410(a)(5)(A).    An\n\nindirect source is defined in the statute as\n\n     a facility, building, structure, installation, real\n     property, road,  or highway which attracts,  or may\n     attract, mobile  sources of pollution.   Such  term\n     includes parking  lots, parking garages,  and other\n     facilities subject to any measure for management of\n     parking supply  . . . .\n\n42 U.S.C.   7410(a)(5)(C).  Asserting that auto makers should\n\nbear  the  brunt  of  reducing  tailpipe  emissions, Congress\n\nimposed the limitations already  described on the EPA efforts\n\nto regulate the magnets for vehicles rather than the vehicles\n\nthemselves.  See  H.R. Rep.  No. 294, 95th  Cong., 1st  Sess.\n                \n\n219-227 (1977).\n\n     Although indirect sources are not in terms excluded from\n\nthe definition of stationary sources--the former provision is\n\ncast instead as  a limitation on EPA authority--the effect of\n\nthe amendment  is  to treat  indirect sources  as a  separate\n\ncategory of sources subject to a different legal regime.  The\n\nstates  may  still  \"choose[]\"  to  regulate  them  in  state\n\nimplementation  plans, 42  U.S.C.     7410(a)(5)(i), but  the\n\ndecision whether and how  to regulate is left largely  to the\n\n                             -13-\n\nstates.   Our best reading  of the statute is  that, at least\n\nafter 1977,  an indirect  source is  not to be  treated as  a\n\nstationary  source under Parts C  and D.   Cf. South Terminal\n                                                             \n\nCorp. v. EPA,  504 F.2d  646, 669 (1st  Cir. 1974)  (\"parking\n            \n\nstructures, which themselves emit  no pollutants but  instead\n\nonly  attract   vehicles  which   emit  pollution,   are  not\n\nstationary sources\").\n\n     Assuming that a stationary source and an indirect source\n\nare  exclusive  categories,  the difficult  question  remains\n\nwhether ventilation  buildings should be  assimilated to  the\n\nformer or to the latter.   It is a question that dictionaries\n\ncannot answer.   The terms  are technical rather  than common\n\nones,  and they  were developed against  the background  of a\n\ncomplex statute  with  interlocking provisions  and  specific\n\ngoals.  Nor does  legislative history furnish any clue  as to\n\nCongress' intent  for  ventilation buildings.   Perhaps  this\n\nsmall corner  among possible applications of  the statute was\n\nsimply overlooked.\n\n     Similarly,  it  is difficult  to  derive  any clear  cut\n\nanswer  from analogy or policy.5  A covered highway or tunnel\n\n                    \n\n     5The Sierra Club urges that the definition of stationary\nsource is analogous to the  definition of \"point source\",  33\nU.S.C.    1362(14), in the Clean Water Act and that we should\nregard  the  related  caselaw  as precedent.    See  National\n                                                             \nWildlife v. Gorsuch, 693 F.2d  156, 173-174 (D.C. Cir. 1982).\n                   \nWe find little help from a different term used in a different\nstatutory scheme.  Nor  do we think that it  matters whether,\nas the  Sierra Club  asserts, pollution tests  or projections\ndone by  engineers for  the ventilation  systems are akin  to\n\n                             -14-\n\nwith  a ventilation system is akin to an uncovered highway or\n\nopen  sided  garage--clearly,  indirect sources--in  multiple\n\nsenses: in each instance the  facility or space attracts more\n\ncars, pollution in the vicinity may be greatly increased, and\n\nthe initial source  of the pollution is  the cars themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, the possibility exists (no information has\n\nbeen  provided to  us  on the  point)  that the  large  scale\n\nventilation systems  may  be more  potent than  a highway  or\n\ngarage  in  concentrating  and  expelling  pollutants   in  a\n\nspecific area; and  on this  ground, if no  other, one  might\n\ndistinguish between  them and  a facility that  is ordinarily\n\nventilated without  mechanical aid.  Thus  the analogy hardly\n\ndispels all doubt.\n\n     Two other  arguments pressed by  the parties seem  to us\n\ninconclusive.   The Sierra Club points us to a new provision,\n\nadded  to  Title  I in  1990  without  limitation  as to  its\n\napplication,  which for  the  first time  defines  stationary\n\nsource as meaning \"generally  any source of an air  pollutant\n\nexcept those  emissions resulting  directly from an  internal\n\ncombustion  engine  for  transportation purposes  or  from  a\n\nnonroad engine or nonroad vehicle  as defined in section 7550\n\n.  . . .\"  42 U.S.C.   7602(z).  The Sierra Club stresses the\n\nword   \"directly,\"  arguing  that   the  emissions  from  the\n\n                    \n\nthose  done for  stationary sources;  presumably, they  would\nalso be similar if the system vented a large garage, which is\nunquestionably an indirect source.\n\n                             -15-\n\nventilation shaft do not fit the  \"except\" clause because the\n\nauto emissions  are emitted first (\"directly,\"  in the Sierra\n\nClub's  view) into the air  of the covered  highway or tunnel\n\nandonly thengatheredbyfansand spewedoutthroughtheventilators.\n\n     The government brief offers its  own parsing of this new\n\nlanguage, but  both sides'  arguments about what  is \"direct\"\n\nand  what  is an  \"indirect\" emission  have  the flavor  of a\n\nMedieval dispute in theology.   The reality is that  Congress\n\nframed  this new  subsection  (z) to  deal  with an  entirely\n\ndifferent problem,  namely, to include  within the stationary\n\nsource definition mobile sources  of pollution, like ships in\n\nport and  portable asphalt  concrete plants,  so far  as they\n\nemit pollutants as part of their stationary activities, e.g.,\n                                                             \n\nby leaking fuel at dockside  (in contrast to engine emissions\n\nthat   occur  when  the  ship  or  plant  travels  to  a  new\n\ndestination).   S. Rep. No.  228, 101st Cong.,  1st Sess. 376\n\n(1990).  In other words,  Congress was not addressing  tunnel\n\nventilation when it drew up this new provision.\n\n     Conversely,  we  are  doubtful  about  the  government's\n\nargument   based  upon   the   structure   of  the   statute.\n\nAdmittedly,  Congress did  establish  two different  regimes:\n\nthat  in Title  I,  with  which  we are  concerned,  governed\n\nstationary  sources;  that  in   Title  II  created  a  quite\n\ndifferent regime, part of which is familiar to anyone who has\n\na  car  inspected, to  regulate  vehicle emissions  directly.\n\n                             -16-\n\nThis  symmetry could  suggest  that  tailpipe  pollution--the\n\nsource of the pollutants at issue here--was not meant to fall\n\nwithin Title I at all.  The difficulty is that Congress might\n\nnot have minded two layers of control, and contrivances  like\n\nthe \"indirect  source\" provision in  Title I blur  the notion\n\nthat auto pollution is exclusively a Title II problem.\n\n     In the end,  we think the balance is  tipped here by the\n\nexplicit administrative interpretation  of the Clean Air  Act\n\nadopted  by the EPA.  In approving the addition of regulation\n\n7.38  to Massachusetts'  state  implementation plan,  the EPA\n\nstated:\n\n     Tunnel ventilation  systems, which do  not generate\n     their  own  emissions  but  rather   simply  funnel\n     emissions from mobile  sources, are not  stationary\n     sources  within the meaning of the Clean Air Act.  \n\n57 Fed. Reg. 46310, 46311 (1992).  The Supreme Court has told\n\nus that in  construing a statute the courts should ordinarily\n\nshow  a  measure  of  deference to  the  agency  charged with\n\nadministering the  statute.6  The  case most often  cited for\n\nthat  precept   is  Chevron,   which  involved  a   different\n                           \n\napplication of  the very  same \"stationary  source\" provision\n\nthat is now before us.\n\n                    \n\n     6See Environmental Protection Agency v. National Crushed\n                                                             \nStone Ass'n, 449 U.S. 64, 83 (1980); Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.\n                                                          \nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984);\n                                       \nUnited  States v.

See,\n                                                             \n\ne.g., INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,  480 U.S. 421, 448 (1987).   To\n                            \n\nbe  sure,  the  courts  have   the  last  word  on  statutory\n\ninterpretation--the  question  is one  of  the  weight to  be\n                                                      \n\naccorded to agency views--and often the statute's language or\n\nhistory  leaves no latitude for  the agency.   In other cases\n\nthe  issue  of  interpretation  may  be  so  central  to  the\n\noperation  of  the statute  that,  whether  or not  Congress'\n\nmeaning  is clear, it  is improbable that  Congress meant for\n\nthe courts to  defer to the agency.  We do not think these or\n\nother qualifications on Chevron deflect its impact here.\n                               \n\n     On the contrary, this statute  is ambiguous on the issue\n                                      \n\nbefore us,  at least when  the words \"stationary  source\" are\n\nread  together with  the  \"indirect source\"  proviso and  the\n\nstructural  juxtaposition  of  Titles  I   and  II.       The\n\napplication of the stationary and indirect source language to\n\ntunnel  ventilation is  not the  heart of  the statute  but a\n\nfringe  issue on which  Congress did not  clearly express its\n\nintent.   The  Clean  Air Act  is  an immensely  complex  and\n\ntechnical statute  more familiar to EPA than  to anyone else,\n\nand  the   task  of   making  its  parts   function  together\n\nharmoniously is entrusted to many actors but above all to the\n\nEPA.  \n\n                             -18-\n\n     In sum this is a case in which Chevron  and deference to\n                                           \n\nthe agency  are  not make-weights  or  subsidiary  arguments.\n\nRather,  in  this  fairly  debatable  case,  where  statutory\n\nlanguage  is  ambiguous, legislative  history  is silent  and\n\npolicies  and analogies can be and have been mustered on both\n\nsides,  we  think  that  the EPA's  unqualified  and  precise\n\nreading  is  decisive.     It  is  unnecessary  to  calibrate\n\nperfectly  the weight to be accorded to  the agency view in a\n\ncase of this species:  once \"considerable\" weight is accorded\n\nto EPA's reading  of the  statute, see Chevron,  467 U.S.  at\n                                              \n\n844, it is enough to tip a set of scales otherwise so closely\n\nbalanced.\n\n      IV. THE MASSACHUSETTS REGULATIONS AND EPA APPROVAL\n\n     Our concern  with the district  court case is  not quite\n\nover.   Even if Congress  did not  designate the  ventilation\n\nfacilities  in   this   case  as   stationary  sources,   the\n\npossibility  remains that  Massachusetts  has adopted  in its\n\nstate implementation plan--and then  sought to ignore for its\n\nown construction project--pertinent  legal restrictions  that\n\ncan be implemented through a  suit under the Clean Air Act.  \n\nOf  course, not every state-law restriction on a project is a\n\nmatter of federal  concern, but a  state restriction that  is\n\npart of a federally  approved state implementation plan under\n\nthe  Clean  Air Act  may at  least  in some  circumstances be\n\n                             -19-\n\nwithin the purview of a citizens suit under 42 U.S.C.   7604.\n\n     At  one point  in its  brief, the  Sierra Club  seems to\n\nargue  that whatever  Congress may  have meant  by stationary\n\nsource,  Massachusetts  in  its  general  permit  requirement\n\nregulation  7.02,  310  C.M.R.     7.02,  has  required  pre-\n\nconstruction approval of a  class of facilities that includes\n\nthe ventilation  buildings  in this  case.   One  version  of\n\nregulation  7.02   has  been  approved  by  EPA  as  part  of\n\nMassachusetts'   state   implementation   plan.      Although\n\nMassachusetts has  adopted a later version  not yet approved,\n                                               \n\nwe will  assume arguendo that the  original, approved version\n                        \n\nof the regulation still exists as a matter of federal law and\n\nthat a violation of this version  might well be remedied by a\n\ncitizen suit under the federal statute.7\n\n     The difficulty  with the Sierra Club's  argument, as the\n\ngovernment brief points out, is  that this regulation on  its\n\nface applies  to a short  list of specific  facilities (e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nchemical products manufacturing plants)  that do not  include\n\nhighways,  tunnels or  associated ventilation  systems.   The\n\n                    \n\n     7The  Sierra  Club  also  argues that  the  more  recent\nversion of regulation 7.02 applies to the project (or  would,\nif not invalidly qualified  by regulation 7.38); but we  need\nnot  decide whether  the  more general  language  of the  new\nversion could embrace highway and tunnel ventilation systems.\nThe  new  version  does  not  reflect  a  federally  approved\nrequirement, nor do we think that it casts any light upon, or\nrepresents an exercise of authority under, the older version.\n\n                             -20-\n\nregulation  also applies  to  \"such other  facilities as  the\n\n[state]   Department   [of   Environmental  Protection]   may\n\nrequire,\"  but  that  state  agency  has  not  required  pre-\n\nconstruction review of  the ventilation buildings  under this\n\nversion of the regulation.  The most that the Sierra Club can\n\nextract  from the  affidavit  submitted by  the  head of  the\n\nagency is that his  agency wobbled over  the issue of how  to\n\nregulate the ventilators at issue  in this case, and  finally\n\ndecided to propose the  \"indirect source\" regime now embodied\n\nin regulation 7.38.  \n\n     Regulation 7.38  which  now governs  tunnel  ventilation\n\nsystems says  that they are  not subject to  regulation 7.02.\n\nWe think that this exclusion seeks to remove ambiguity and is\n\nvery weak  evidence that the  new version of  regulation 7.02\n\nwould otherwise cover such systems, and no evidence at all of\n\nthe meaning of  the old version.   Nor do  we agree with  the\n\nSierra  Club that its reading of old regulation 7.02 is borne\n\nout by Town of Brookline v. Commissioner of the Department of\n                                                             \n\nEnvironmental Quality  Engineering, 387 Mass. 372, 439 N.E.2d\n                                  \n\n372 (1982).  That case involved the application of regulation\n\n7.02  to   a  diesel  fuel-powered  facility   (in  fact,  an\n\nelectrical generating station), which is listed as a facility\n\nautomatically covered by old regulation 7.02.\n\n     To  construe   the  old  version   of  regulation   7.02\n\ndefinitively is  a daunting  task, for  it was complex,  ill-\n\n                             -21-\n\nstructured, and apparently confusing even to the state agency\n\nthat administered it.  But the Sierra Club's argument depends\n\nupon a showing by it that  the old regulation 7.02 did govern\n\nhighway and tunnel ventilation systems.  Such systems do  not\n\nfall within the list of  specifically named facilities in the\n\nregulation.   Similarly, the Sierra  Club has not  shown that\n\nthe state agency ever extended that version of the regulation\n\nto such systems under the \"may require\" clause.\n\n     This  brings us to the attack on regulation 7.38 that is\n\nthe subject of  Sierra Club's  direct review  petition.   One\n\nmight  at first wonder why  the Sierra Club  is interested in\n\noverthrowing a  regulation which, if less  stringent than the\n\npre-construction  permit  requirement  for  major  stationary\n\nsources,  is  at least  a sizable  step  in the  direction of\n\nregulating ventilation  systems, a  step that the  state need\n\nnot  take at all if--as  the EPA has  ruled--such systems are\n\nnot  stationary  sources  but  merely  adjuncts  to  indirect\n\nsources.    Indeed,  the   EPA's  notice  approving  the  new\n\nregulation  notes  that   the  Conservation  Law   Foundation\n\nendorsed it.  57 Fed. Reg. 46310, 46311 (1992).\n\n     The answer  is that  the Sierra Club,  with considerable\n\nimagination, has constructed the following argument: the 1990\n\namendments to  the Clean Air  Act contained a  savings clause\n\nthat  sought to  forbid  states from  softening pre-amendment\n\n\"control requirement[s]\"  in areas that had  not attained the\n\n                             -22-\n\nnational air quality  standard for a  pollutant, 42 U.S.C.   \n\n7515;  the Boston area has admittedly not met these standards\n\nfor certain pollutants; and  therefore (says the Sierra Club)\n\nregulation 7.38 is in violation of the savings clause because\n\nit substitutes  as to  tunnel ventilation systems  the softer\n\nregime of  the new regulation  7.38 for  the more  stringent,\n\npreviously applicable regime of regulation 7.02.\n\n     We will assume without  deciding that the savings clause\n\nwould prevent  the weakening of a  state implementation plan.\n\nBut even so  we do not  read the savings  clause to refer  to\n\nanything  other than  an effective, federally  approved state\n\nimplementation plan.8  It is  the older version of regulation\n\n7.02  which alone was federally  approved at the  time of the\n\n1990 Clean  Air Act Amendments.   And, as  already explained,\n\nthe Sierra  Club has failed  to establish that  the pertinent\n\nolder version of regulation 7.02 did apply to covered highway\n\nor tunnel ventilation systems.  Accordingly, regulation  7.38\n\n                    \n\n     8As Senator Chafee explained in the floor debate on this\nprovision:\n\n          \"The  savings  provision was  intended to\n          ensure  that there  is no  backsliding on\n          the   implementation   of   adopted   and\n          currently feasible measures that  EPA has\n          approved    as    part    of   a    State\n          implementation plan in  the past, or that\n          EPA has  added to State plans  on its own\n          initiative or pursuant  to a court  order\n          or settlement.\"\n\n136 Cong. Rec. S17,237 (daily ed., October 26, 1990).\n\n                             -23-\n\ndoes  not  weaken a  federally approved  state implementation\n\nplan but rather strengthens  it by extending a new  regime to\n\nsuch  ventilation  systems   where  previously  no  federally\n\napproved regime applied at all.  \n\n     We are  left with two  further arguments in  relation to\n\nregulation  7.38.  First, it is  claimed that regulation 7.38\n\nis  invalid because, according to  the Sierra Club, the state\n\nwas  required  by  M.G.L. ch.  111,     142A,  to obtain  the\n\napproval of  the Governor of Massachusetts  and the Executive\n\nCouncil  but did  not  do so.    This argument  was  made, it\n\nappears,  on the premise  that regulation 7.38  was needed by\n\nthe government defendants in order  to remove a bar otherwise\n\npresented by regulation 7.02.   As we have seen,  the premise\n\nis mistaken, and invalidating  regulation 7.38 would probably\n\nfree the ventilation  systems from any federally  enforceable\n\nregulation.\n\n     Nevertheless,   the    issue   of   governor-and-council\n\napproval,  although irrelevant  to the injunction  action, is\n\nraised by the Sierra Club's petition to review EPA's approval\n\nof the new regulation.  Since the direct review statute has a\n\ntime limit  on petitions, 42  U.S.C.   7607(b)(1),  we cannot\n\nproperly defer decision on the validity of regulation 7.38 to\n\nsome future point.  Indeed,  EPA in approving the regulation,\n\nnoted  that Massachusetts'  Secretary  of State  had attested\n\nthat  the regulation  was  properly adopted,  and EPA  itself\n\n                             -24-\n\nruled  that the  Massachusetts  Department  of  Environmental\n\nProtection  had authority \"to  adopt such regulations without\n\napproval  by  the Governor  and Council.\"    57 Fed.  Reg. at\n\n46312.\n\n     It is difficult for anyone  but a Massachusetts court to\n\npronounce  with  certainty  on  this  issue.    But when  the\n\nregulation  is attested  by  the state  secretary as  validly\n\nadopted and its procedural validity  is supported in a  brief\n\nsigned  by the  state's  attorney general,  it  would take  a\n\nrather  strong  showing  to  persuade  us to  hold  that  the\n\nregulation is  invalid on  procedural grounds.   Assuming (as\n\nseems likely) that its procedural  validity is open to review\n\nin this  court and that the state  secretary's attestation is\n\nnecessary but  not conclusive,9  we think that  EPA correctly\n\nconcluded that the  regulation was  properly adopted  without\n\nthe approval of governor and council.\n\n     The state in submitting regulation 7.38 to  the EPA said\n\nthat it was  adopted pursuant to M.G.L. ch.  111,    142B and\n\n142D, not section  142A.  Section  142B establishes a  Boston\n\narea pollution  control district and gives  the Department of\n\nEnvironmental  Protection   authority  to  issue   rules  and\n\nregulations to prevent pollution in the district.  Regulation\n\n                    \n\n     9The  Clean   Air  Act  requires  a   state  to  provide\n\"necessary assurances\" that it  has authority under state law\nto  carry  out   the  implementation  plan.    42   U.S.C.   \n7410(a)(2)(E)(i).\n\n                             -25-\n\n7.38, which  is directed exclusively to  the Boston district,\n\nappears  to fit comfortably within the ambit of section 142B.\n\nThe  rulemaking provision  of  section 142B,  unlike  section\n\n142A, contains no  requirement for approval  of rules by  the\n\nstate's governor or council.\n\n     The  Sierra   Club's  contrary  argument  is   based  on\n\nconfusing  language  in M.G.L.  ch.  111,    142A,  a broader\n\nprovision governing air pollution in general.  In its opening\n\nsentence,  this   section   says  that   the  Department   of\n\nEnvironmental Protection,  \"in this section  and in  sections\n\none hundred and forty-two  B to one hundred and  forty-two E,\n\ninclusive, hereinafter  called the department\" may subject to\n\nthe approval of the governor and council adopt regulations to\n\ncontrol pollution.   Id.   The  Sierra Club  apparently reads\n                        \n\nthis sentence as  extending the governor-and-council approval\n\nrequirement of section 142A to rules made under section 142B.\n\n     We think the more natural reading of the quoted language\n\nin  section 142A  is to  specify that the  term \"department,\"\n\nwhen  used without  further  explanation in  the cited  later\n\nsections,  means the Department  of Environmental Protection.\n\nSection  142B,   for  example,   does  refer  only   to  \"the\n\ndepartment.\"    Nor   is  there  anything  remarkable   about\n\nrequiring    governor-and-council   approval    for   general\n\nregulations while not doing so for those directed to a single\n\ndistrict;  indeed, the  Sierra  Club reading  would make  the\n\n                             -26-\n\ngrant  of  rulemaking   power  in  section  142B   redundant.\n\nAccordingly, we  reject this challenge to  the EPA's approval\n\nand dismiss the petition to review.\n\n     The  government  brief   construes  the  Sierra   Club's\n\nargument to embrace, in addition  to the claim just rejected,\n\na  further  claim  that  regulation 7.38  cannot  be  applied\n\n\"retroactively\" to the  central artery and tunnel at issue in\n\nthis case.  The  regulation by its terms is intended to apply\n\nto the project.   See 310 C.M.R.   7.38(1).   In response the\n                     \n\ngovernment  argues at  length  that under  Massachusetts  law\n\nwhatever retroactivity  may be  involved in applying  the new\n\nregime  to a  previously  planned but  unbuilt  portion of  a\n\nproject is permissible.\n\n     It  is not entirely clear that the Sierra Club is making\n\nthe argument  attributed to it  by the  government.   However\n\nthis may be, the EPA did not suggest that its approval of the\n\nregulation  depended on how or whether it would be applied to\n\nexisting  projects; the  EPA's  notice of  approval does  not\n\ndiscuss  retroactivity at all.  There is no reason to suppose\n\nthat  EPA's approval is at all dependent on the retroactivity\n\nissue.   We have no  need, in fact  no warrant, to  decide an\n\nissue  that  is not  material  either to  the  district court\n\njudgment nor  to the validity  of the EPA action  that is the\n\nsubject of the petition to review.  \n\n                             -27-\n\n     The judgment of  the district  court is  affirmed.   The\n                                                      \n\npetition for review is denied.\n                             \n\n                             -28-\n",

It also petitions to review the action of the Environmental Protection Agency in approving an amendment to Massachusetts state regulations that bears upon the project.  We affirm the district court and deny the petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. THE FACTS AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts, through its Department of Public Works, has begun construction of a mammoth project that includes rebuilding a major segment of Interstate Route 93 that now runs on a viaduct through downtown Boston and is known as \"the central artery.\"   When the central artery/tunnel project is completed some years from now, the highway segment in question will be widened, sunk below ground level, and mostly covered.  It will connect at the north with a new bridge across the Charles River and at the south with a newly built third harbor tunnel running from South Boston to Logan Airport in East Boston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The depressed and covered portion of the new highway and the tunnel will be ventilated by ducts and fans in six buildings located on the highway route and near the tunnel portals.  Vast amounts of air will be drawn into the covered highway and tunnel, and the mixture of air and motor vehicle emissions will be pumped up through the six buildings and exhausted through stacks ranging from 90 to 225 feet high.  Studies indicate that the project will reduce traffic congestion, increase average speeds, and reduce area-wide carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sierra Club, a non-profit environmental group, believes that whatever the area-wide effects of the project, it will create new \"hot spots\" of pollution in certain of the neighborhoods near to the six ventilation buildings.  In its view, pollution control equipment, in the nature of after-burners, should be installed in the ventilation buildings.  The federal and state governments, which have filed a joint brief in this case, deny that any dangerous hot spots will be created, pointing to studies conducted as part of the project's environmental review.  They also assert that after-burner technology is not feasible because of the low concentration of pollutants in the vented air.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1991, the Sierra Club and certain of its members who live in the vicinity of the central artery brought suit in district court against a collection of state and federal officials associated with the project.  The gravamen of the suit was the Sierra Club's claim that the ventilation buildings planned for the project comprised a \"major stationary source\" of air pollution as that term is used in the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7401, et seq., and counterpart Massachusetts regulations, 310 C.M.R. Sec. 7.00 et seq.   It is common ground that, if the ventilation buildings were so classified, then the project would require a permit or permits from Massachusetts that have not been secured.  To frame this issue entails a brief description of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Clean Air Act enacted a complex statutory regime, several times amended, to control and mitigate air pollution in the United States.  Broadly speaking, Title I of the statute regulates stationary sources of pollution and Title II regulates mobile sources, most importantly motor vehicles.  For specified pollutants, national air quality standards are promulgated by the EPA.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7409.  Whether new construction of polluting facilities is permitted in an area, and what kind of controls are required, depends on whether the area is below or above the standard for each pollutant.  Part C, 42 U.S.C. Secs. 7470-7492, governs permits where the standard has been attained;  Part D applies to so-called nonattainment areas.  Id.  Secs. 7501-7515.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In either event, the construction of a \"major\" new stationary source--normally, one emitting 100 or more tons of pollutant each year, see 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7602(j)--generally requires a permit.  42 U.S.C. Secs. 7475(a), 7502(c)(5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In the case of Boston, some of the pollutants that will flow through the proposed ventilation buildings currently exceed national standards so that new major sources are subject to the more stringent class of limitations;  other pollutants are below the standards and less stringent limitations apply.  By way of example, the Boston area exceeds the national standard for carbon monoxide, and to secure a permit the highway proponents would have to show that a major stationary source can achieve the \"lowest achievable emission rate\" for that pollutant.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7503(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Clean Air Act allocates different responsibilities to the EPA on the one hand and to the states on the other.  Each state is directed to adopt and submit to the EPA for approval a state implementation plan to achieve and maintain the national standards established by the EPA.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7410(a).  See also id. Secs. 7471, 7502.  If the state fails to adopt an approvable plan, the EPA must adopt federal regulations for the area.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7410(c).  Massachusetts has an approved state implementation plan.  Under the Clean Air Act, \"citizen\" suits may be brought to enjoin a project that requires a permit under Parts C or D but has not obtained one.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7604(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, in April 1991 the Sierra Club and certain of its members sought a preliminary injunction against construction of the central artery and tunnel project.  The request was denied on July 30, 1991.  After transfer of the case to another judge, the district court received further briefing and argument.  On September 16, 1992, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the government defendants, state and federal, holding that the ventilation buildings did not comprise stationary sources subject to pre-construction permit requirements.  The Sierra Club and its named members appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before the lawsuit, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection submitted to the EPA on January 30, 1991, a new regulation--regulation 7.38, codified as 310 C.M.R. Sec. 7.38--as a proposed amendment to the Massachusetts state implementation plan.  This regulation seeks to classify tunnel ventilation systems as \"indirect sources\" under the Clean Air Act.  In the early 1970s, the EPA had begun to require that state implementation plans regulate such facilities as parking lots, highways and garages that do not emit pollutants themselves but attract numbers of polluting vehicles.  Congress responded in 1977 by barring the EPA from regulation of what were called \"indirect sources.\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7410(a)(5)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  However, Congress at the same time gave the states permission, if they so chose, to regulate such indirect sources themselves as part of their state implementation plans.  Id. Sec. 7410(a)(5)(A), (C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts, exercising this option through regulation 7.38, proposed to regulate roadway/tunnel ventilation systems as indirect sources.  The regime involves certification by the builder that specified pollution standards will be met, and the Department of Environmental Protection may accept, conditionally approve, or reject the certification after notice and hearing.  Monitoring after construction and periodical renewal of the certificate are required.  The new regulation also states that the systems are not subject to the preconstruction permitting required for various stationary sources under regulation 7.02, 310 C.M.R. Sec. 7.02.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sierra Club opposed the approval of regulation 7.38 when Massachusetts submitted it to the EPA as an amendment to the state implementation plan.  The Sierra Club argued that the effect would be indirectly to relieve the project at issue in this case of the more stringent pre-construction approval required of major stationary sources under the Clean Air Act and the Massachusetts regulations that apply to stationary sources.  After notice and receipt of public comments, the EPA on October 8, 1992, published notice of its approval, 57 Fed.Reg. 46310 (1992).  The Sierra Club then petitioned for review of the EPA's action in this court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7607(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the overlapping issues and common subject, this court consolidated the two appeals taken from the district court judgment with the proceeding for direct review of the EPA action.  In this opinion, we address first a jurisdictional objection raised by the federal defendants, then statutory issues posed by the appeals from the district court, and finally the additional issues posed by the Massachusetts regulations and by the petition to review the EPA's action approving regulation 7.38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal defendants renew in this court their argument, not passed upon below, that the district court \"lacked jurisdiction\" over the complaint against the federal defendants.  The \"citizen suits\" provision of the Clean Air Act permits private suits in three defined classes of cases.  As already noted, it explicitly permits a private suit against anyone who \"proposes to construct\" any major stationary source without a permit required by parts C or D.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7604(a)(3).  The federal defendants deny that they are proposing to construct the project or any part of it;  in other words, they argue that if anyone is subject to suit under subsection (a)(3), it is only Massachusetts officials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute also permits such citizen suits where emission standards or limitations are exceeded, or where the EPA Administrator has failed to perform an act or duty under the Clean Air Act \"which is not discretionary ....\"  42 U.S.C. Secs. 7604(a)(1), (2).  As to these categories, the federal defendants argue that any violations of emission standards or limitations would be those of the state, and that the EPA Administrator cannot be sued for violating a non-discretionary duty since enforcement by the Administrator is inherently a discretionary matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sierra Club, responds, unpersuasively, that any jurisdictional objection has been waived by the failure of the federal defendants to cross appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  More usefully, the Sierra Club urges that the Administrator did violate a non-discretionary duty by failing to take action to enjoin the project, and that in any event the Federal Highway Administration is so closely involved in the funding and planning of this project as to be effectively a party to its construction.  However, like the government brief, the Sierra Club's brief is silent as to what practical implications these questions have in this case where no one has disputed that Massachusetts defendants can be enjoined from construction if a permit is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent some showing that the jurisdictional issue has practical importance in this case, we decline to address it.  Since the Massachusetts officials are subject to suit for constructing the project without a permit, the merits must be reached in any event.  And since we resolve the merits in their favor, the jurisdictional issue as to the federal defendants is pretty close to moot, affecting only the form of the dismissal as to them.  There is ample precedent for by-passing jurisdictional objections when the court can more easily dismiss on the merits.  E.g.,Norton v. Mathews, 427 U.S. 524, 532, 96 S.Ct. 2771, 2775, 49 L.Ed.2d 672 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE STATUTORY ISSUES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The merits of the appeals from the district court judgment turn principally on a narrow point of statutory construction, namely, whether the ventilation buildings that will vent the underground highway and harbor tunnel comprise a \"stationary source or sources\" within the meaning the Clean Air Act.  If so labeled, a permit is required;  apparently the amount of pollutant needed to qualify as a \"major\" source is not at issue.  Easily stated, the issue is less easily resolved:  there is little by way of statutory definition, no useful judicial precedent or legislative history offered to us, and a reasonable possibility that Congress never gave any thought to the idiosyncracy posed by these ventilation buildings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting as one normally does with language, parts C and D, which contain the pre-construction permit requirements for major stationary sources, originally contained no definition of stationary source.  Instead part D defines a \"major stationary source\" as \"any stationary facility or source\" emitting the specified quantity of pollutant.  Part C, by cross-reference (see note 1, above), adopts the same language.  Part A, concerned with so-called performance standards, other than air quality standards, did use the term \"stationary source\" in 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7411, defining it as \"any building, structure, facility, or installation which emits or may emit any air pollutant.\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7411(a)(3).  That definition, however, was adopted \"for purposes of this section,\" i.e., section 7411.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus far the breadth of the language appears helpful to the Sierra Club position, since linguistically a ventilation system with a stack could be called a \"facility,\" a \"source\" or even a \"building.\"   The table tilted back the other way in 1977 when Congress amended the Clean Air Act to exclude \"indirect sources\" from mandatory coverage in state implementation plans.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7410(a)(5)(A).  An indirect source is defined in the statute as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>a facility, building, structure, installation, real property, road, or highway which attracts, or may attract, mobile sources of pollution.  Such term includes parking lots, parking garages, and other facilities subject to any measure for management of parking supply....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. Sec. 7410(a)(5)(C).  Asserting that auto makers should bear the brunt of reducing tailpipe emissions, Congress imposed the limitations already described on the EPA efforts to regulate the magnets for vehicles rather than the vehicles themselves.  See H.R.Rep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 219-227 (1977), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1977, 1077, 1298-1306.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although indirect sources are not in terms excluded from the definition of stationary sources--the former provision is cast instead as a limitation on EPA authority--the effect of the amendment is to treat indirect sources as a separate category of sources subject to a different legal regime.  The states may still \"choose[ ]\" to regulate them in state implementation plans, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7410(a)(5)(A)(i), but the decision whether and how to regulate is left largely to the states.  Our best reading of the statute is that, at least after 1977, an indirect source is not to be treated as a stationary source under Parts C and D.  Cf.South Terminal Corp. v. EPA, 504 F.2d 646, 669 (1st Cir.1974) (\"parking structures, which themselves emit no pollutants but instead only attract vehicles which emit pollution, are not stationary sources\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that a stationary source and an indirect source are exclusive categories, the difficult question remains whether ventilation buildings should be assimilated to the former or to the latter.  It is a question that dictionaries cannot answer.  The terms are technical rather than common ones, and they were developed against the background of a complex statute with interlocking provisions and specific goals.  Nor does legislative history furnish any clue as to Congress' intent for ventilation buildings.  Perhaps this small corner among possible applications of the statute was simply overlooked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, it is difficult to derive any clear cut answer from analogy or policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  A covered highway or tunnel with a ventilation system is akin to an uncovered highway or open sided garage--clearly, indirect sources--in multiple senses:  in each instance the facility or space attracts more cars, pollution in the vicinity may be greatly increased, and the initial source of the pollution is the cars themselves.  On the other hand, the possibility exists (no information has been provided to us on the point) that the large scale ventilation systems may be more potent than a highway or garage in concentrating and expelling pollutants in a specific area;  and on this ground, if no other, one might distinguish between them and a facility that is ordinarily ventilated without mechanical aid.  Thus the analogy hardly dispels all doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two other arguments pressed by the parties seem to us inconclusive.  The Sierra Club points us to a new provision, added to Title I in 1990 without limitation as to its application, which for the first time defines stationary source as meaning \"generally any source of an air pollutant except those emissions resulting directly from an internal combustion engine for transportation purposes or from a nonroad engine or nonroad vehicle as defined in section 7550....\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7602(z).  The Sierra Club stresses the word \"directly,\" arguing that the emissions from the ventilation shaft do not fit the \"except\" clause because the auto emissions are emitted first (\"directly,\" in the Sierra Club's view) into the air of the covered highway or tunnel and only then gathered by fans and spewed out through the ventilators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government brief offers its own parsing of this new language, but both sides' arguments about what is \"direct\" and what is an \"indirect\" emission have the flavor of a Medieval dispute in theology.  The reality is that Congress framed this new subsection (z) to deal with an entirely different problem, namely, to include within the stationary source definition mobile sources of pollution, like ships in port and portable asphalt concrete plants, so far as they emit pollutants as part of their stationary activities, e.g., by leaking fuel at dockside (in contrast to engine emissions that occur when the ship or plant travels to a new destination).  S.Rep. No. 228, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 376 (1990).  In other words, Congress was not addressing tunnel ventilation when it drew up this new provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely, we are doubtful about the government's argument based upon the structure of the statute.  Admittedly, Congress did establish two different regimes:  that in Title I, with which we are concerned, governed stationary sources;  that in Title II created a quite different regime, part of which is familiar to anyone who has a car inspected, to regulate vehicle emissions directly.  This symmetry could suggest that tailpipe pollution--the source of the pollutants at issue here--was not meant to fall within Title I at all.  The difficulty is that Congress might not have minded two layers of control, and contrivances like the \"indirect source\" provision in Title I blur the notion that auto pollution is exclusively a Title II problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we think the balance is tipped here by the explicit administrative interpretation of the Clean Air Act adopted by the EPA.  In approving the addition of regulation 7.38 to Massachusetts' state implementation plan, the EPA stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>Tunnel ventilation systems, which do not generate their own emissions but rather simply funnel emissions from mobile sources, are not stationary sources within the meaning of the Clean Air Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">57 Fed.Reg. 46310, 46311 (1992).  The Supreme Court has told us that in construing a statute the courts should ordinarily show a measure of deference to the agency charged with administering the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The case most often cited for that precept is Chevron, which involved a different application of the very same \"stationary source\" provision that is now before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Chevron doctrine has been the subject of much debate and, in subsequent decisions, the Supreme Court may have softened its impact somewhat and in some situations.  See, e.g.,INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 448, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 1221, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).  To be sure, the courts have the last word on statutory interpretation--the question is one of the weight to be accorded to agency views--and often the statute's language or history leaves no latitude for the agency.  In other cases the issue of interpretation may be so central to the operation of the statute that, whether or not Congress' meaning is clear, it is improbable that Congress meant for the courts to defer to the agency.  We do not think these or other qualifications on Chevron deflect its impact here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the contrary, this statute is ambiguous on the issue before us, at least when the words \"stationary source\" are read together with the \"indirect source\" proviso and the structural juxtaposition of Titles I and II.  The application of the stationary and indirect source language to tunnel ventilation is not the heart of the statute but a fringe issue on which Congress did not clearly express its intent.  The Clean Air Act is an immensely complex and technical statute more familiar to the EPA than to anyone else, and the task of making its parts function together harmoniously is entrusted to many actors but above all to the EPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum this is a case in which Chevron and deference to the agency are not make-weights or subsidiary arguments.  Rather, in this fairly debatable case, where statutory language is ambiguous, legislative history is silent and policies and analogies can be and have been mustered on both sides, we think that the EPA's unqualified and precise reading is decisive.  It is unnecessary to calibrate perfectly the weight to be accorded to the agency view in a case of this species:  once \"considerable\" weight is accorded to EPA's reading of the statute, seeChevron, 467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. at 2782, it is enough to tip a set of scales otherwise so closely balanced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>IV. THE MASSACHUSETTS REGULATIONS AND EPA APPROVAL</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our concern with the district court case is not quite over.  Even if Congress did not designate the ventilation facilities in this case as stationary sources, the possibility remains that Massachusetts has adopted in its state implementation plan--and then sought to ignore for its own construction project--pertinent legal restrictions that can be implemented through a suit under the Clean Air Act.  Of course, not every state-law restriction on a project is a matter of federal concern, but a state restriction that is part of a federally approved state implementation plan under the Clean Air Act may at least in some circumstances be within the purview of a citizens suit under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7604.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At one point in its brief, the Sierra Club seems to argue that whatever Congress may have meant by stationary source, Massachusetts in its general permit requirement regulation 7.02, 310 C.M.R. Sec. 7.02, has required pre-construction approval of a class of facilities that includes the ventilation buildings in this case.  One version of regulation 7.02 has been approved by the EPA as part of Massachusetts' state implementation plan.  Although Massachusetts has adopted a later version not yet approved, we will assume arguendo that the original, approved version of the regulation still exists as a matter of federal law and that a violation of this version might well be remedied by a citizen suit under the federal statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty with the Sierra Club's argument, as the government brief points out, is that this regulation on its face applies to a short list of specific facilities (e.g., chemical products manufacturing plants) that do not include highways, tunnels or associated ventilation systems.  The regulation also applies to \"such other facilities as the [state] Department [of Environmental Protection] may require,\" but that state agency has not required pre-construction review of the ventilation buildings under this version of the regulation.  The most that the Sierra Club can extract from the affidavit submitted by the head of the agency is that his agency wobbled over the issue of how to regulate the ventilators at issue in this case, and finally decided to propose the \"indirect source\" regime now embodied in regulation 7.38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regulation 7.38 which now governs tunnel ventilation systems says that they are not subject to regulation 7.02.  We think that this exclusion seeks to remove ambiguity and is very weak evidence that the new version of regulation 7.02 would otherwise cover such systems, and no evidence at all of the meaning of the old version.  Nor do we agree with the Sierra Club that its reading of old regulation 7.02 is borne out by Town of Brookline v. Commissioner of Department of Environmental Quality Engineering, 387 Mass. 372, 439 N.E.2d 372 (1982).  That case involved the application of regulation 7.02 to a diesel fuel-powered facility (in fact, an electrical generating station), which is listed as a facility automatically covered by old regulation 7.02.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To construe the old version of regulation 7.02 definitively is a daunting task, for it was complex, ill-structured, and apparently confusing even to the state agency that administered it.  But the Sierra Club's argument depends upon a showing by it that the old regulation 7.02 did govern highway and tunnel ventilation systems.  Such systems do not fall within the list of specifically named facilities in the regulation.  Similarly, the Sierra Club has not shown that the state agency ever extended that version of the regulation to such systems under the \"may require\" clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the attack on regulation 7.38 that is the subject of the Sierra Club's direct review petition.  One might at first wonder why the Sierra Club is interested in overthrowing a regulation which, if less stringent than the pre-construction permit requirement for major stationary sources, is at least a sizable step in the direction of regulating ventilation systems, a step that the state need not take at all if--as the EPA has ruled--such systems are not stationary sources but merely adjuncts to indirect sources.  Indeed, the EPA's notice approving the new regulation notes that the Conservation Law Foundation endorsed it.  57 Fed.Reg. 46310, 46311 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer is that the Sierra Club, with considerable imagination, has constructed the following argument:  the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act contained a savings clause that sought to forbid states from softening pre-amendment \"control requirement[s]\" in areas that had not attained the national air quality standard for a pollutant, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7515;  the Boston area has admittedly not met these standards for certain pollutants;  and therefore (says the Sierra Club) regulation 7.38 is in violation of the savings clause because it substitutes as to tunnel ventilation systems the softer regime of the new regulation 7.38 for the more stringent, previously applicable regime of regulation 7.02.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will assume without deciding that the savings clause would prevent the weakening of a state implementation plan.  But even so we do not read the savings clause to refer to anything other than an effective, federally approved state implementation plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  It is the older version of regulation 7.02 which alone was federally approved at the time of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.  And, as already explained, the Sierra Club has failed to establish that the pertinent older version of regulation 7.02 did apply to covered highway or tunnel ventilation systems.  Accordingly, regulation 7.38 does not weaken a federally approved state implementation plan but rather strengthens it by extending a new regime to such ventilation systems where previously no federally approved regime applied at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are left with two further arguments in relation to regulation 7.38.  First, it is claimed that regulation 7.38 is invalid because, according to the Sierra Club, the state was required by M.G.L. ch. 111, Sec. 142A, to obtain the approval of the Governor of Massachusetts and the Executive Council but did not do so.  This argument was made, it appears, on the premise that regulation 7.38 was needed by the government defendants in order to remove a bar otherwise presented by regulation 7.02.  As we have seen, the premise is mistaken, and invalidating regulation 7.38 would probably free the ventilation systems from any federally enforceable regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the issue of governor-and-council approval, although irrelevant to the injunction action, is raised by the Sierra Club's petition to review the EPA's approval of the new regulation.  Since the direct review statute has a time limit on petitions, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7607(b)(1), we cannot properly defer decision on the validity of regulation 7.38 to some future point.  Indeed, the EPA in approving the regulation, noted that Massachusetts' Secretary of State had attested that the regulation was properly adopted, and the EPA itself ruled that the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection had authority \"to adopt such regulations without approval by the Governor and Council.\"  57 Fed.Reg. at 46312.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is difficult for anyone but a Massachusetts court to pronounce with certainty on this issue.  But when the regulation is attested by the state secretary as validly adopted and its procedural validity is supported in a brief signed by the state's attorney general, it would take a rather strong showing to persuade us to hold that the regulation is invalid on procedural grounds.  Assuming (as seems likely) that its procedural validity is open to review in this court and that the state secretary's attestation is necessary but not conclusive,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> we think that the EPA correctly concluded that the regulation was properly adopted without the approval of governor and council.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state in submitting regulation 7.38 to the EPA said that it was adopted pursuant to M.G.L. ch. 111, Secs. 142B and 142D, not section 142A.  Section 142B establishes a Boston area pollution control district and gives the Department of Environmental Protection authority to issue rules and regulations to prevent pollution in the district.  Regulation 7.38, which is directed exclusively to the Boston district, appears to fit comfortably within the ambit of section 142B.  The rulemaking provision of section 142B, unlike section 142A, contains no requirement for approval of rules by the state's governor or council.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sierra Club's contrary argument is based on confusing language in M.G.L. ch. 111, Sec. 142A, a broader provision governing air pollution in general.  In its opening sentence, this section says that the Department of Environmental Protection, \"in this section and in sections one hundred and forty-two B to one hundred and forty-two E, inclusive, hereinafter called the department\" may subject to the approval of the governor and council adopt regulations to control pollution.  Id.  The Sierra Club apparently reads this sentence as extending the governor-and-council approval requirement of section 142A to rules made under section 142B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the more natural reading of the quoted language in section 142A is to specify that the term \"department,\" when used without further explanation in the cited later sections, means the Department of Environmental Protection.  Section 142B, for example, does refer only to \"the department.\"   Nor is there anything remarkable about requiring governor-and-council approval for general regulations while not doing so for those directed to a single district;  indeed, the Sierra Club reading would make the grant of rulemaking power in section 142B redundant.  Accordingly, we reject this challenge to the EPA's approval and dismiss the petition to review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government brief construes the Sierra Club's argument to embrace, in addition to the claim just rejected, a further claim that regulation 7.38 cannot be applied \"retroactively\" to the central artery and tunnel at issue in this case.  The regulation by its terms is intended to apply to the project.  See 310 C.M.R. Sec. 7.38(1).  In response the government argues at length that under Massachusetts law whatever retroactivity may be involved in applying the new regime to a previously planned but unbuilt portion of a project is permissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not entirely clear that the Sierra Club is making the argument attributed to it by the government.  However this may be, the EPA did not suggest that its approval of the regulation depended on how or whether it would be applied to existing projects;  the EPA's notice of approval does not discuss retroactivity at all.  There is no reason to suppose that the EPA's approval is at all dependent on the retroactivity issue.  We have no need, in fact no warrant, to decide an issue that is not material either to the district court judgment nor to the validity of the EPA action that is the subject of the petition to review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.

Secs. 7475, 7479, but--with qualifications not here relevant--the statute instructs that the terms \"major stationary source\" and \"major emitting facility\" be used interchangeably.  42 U.S.C.

We find little help from a different term used in a different statutory scheme.  Nor do we think that it matters whether, as the Sierra Club asserts, pollution tests or projections done by engineers for the ventilation systems are akin to those done for stationary sources;  presumably, they would also be similar if the system vented a large garage, which is unquestionably an indirect source</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> SeeEnvironmental Protection Agency v.

THE FACTS AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts, through its Department of Public Works, has begun construction of a mammoth project that includes rebuilding a major segment of Interstate Route 93 that now runs on a viaduct through downtown Boston and is known as \"the central artery.\"   When the central artery/tunnel project is completed some years from now, the highway segment in question will be widened, sunk below ground level, and mostly covered.  It will connect at the north with a new bridge across the Charles River and at the south with a newly built third harbor tunnel running from South Boston to Logan Airport in East Boston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The depressed and covered portion of the new highway and the tunnel will be ventilated by ducts and fans in six buildings located on the highway route and near the tunnel portals.  Vast amounts of air will be drawn into the covered highway and tunnel, and the mixture of air and motor vehicle emissions will be pumped up through the six buildings and exhausted through stacks ranging from 90 to 225 feet high.  Studies indicate that the project will reduce traffic congestion, increase average speeds, and reduce area-wide carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sierra Club, a non-profit environmental group, believes that whatever the area-wide effects of the project, it will create new \"hot spots\" of pollution in certain of the neighborhoods near to the six ventilation buildings.  In its view, pollution control equipment, in the nature of after-burners, should be installed in the ventilation buildings.  The federal and state governments, which have filed a joint brief in this case, deny that any dangerous hot spots will be created, pointing to studies conducted as part of the project's environmental review.  They also assert that after-burner technology is not feasible because of the low concentration of pollutants in the vented air.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1991, the Sierra Club and certain of its members who live in the vicinity of the central artery brought suit in district court against a collection of state and federal officials associated with the project.  The gravamen of the suit was the Sierra Club's claim that the ventilation buildings planned for the project comprised a \"major stationary source\" of air pollution as that term is used in the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7401, et seq., and counterpart Massachusetts regulations, 310 C.M.R. Sec. 7.00 et seq.   It is common ground that, if the ventilation buildings were so classified, then the project would require a permit or permits from Massachusetts that have not been secured.  To frame this issue entails a brief description of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Clean Air Act enacted a complex statutory regime, several times amended, to control and mitigate air pollution in the United States.  Broadly speaking, Title I of the statute regulates stationary sources of pollution and Title II regulates mobile sources, most importantly motor vehicles.  For specified pollutants, national air quality standards are promulgated by the EPA.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7409.  Whether new construction of polluting facilities is permitted in an area, and what kind of controls are required, depends on whether the area is below or above the standard for each pollutant.  Part C, 42 U.S.C. Secs. 7470-7492, governs permits where the standard has been attained;  Part D applies to so-called nonattainment areas.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  Secs. 7501-7515.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In either event, the construction of a \"major\" new stationary source--normally, one emitting 100 or more tons of pollutant each year, see 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7602(j)--generally requires a permit.  42 U.S.C. Secs. 7475(a), 7502(c)(5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In the case of Boston, some of the pollutants that will flow through the proposed ventilation buildings currently exceed national standards so that new major sources are subject to the more stringent class of limitations;  other pollutants are below the standards and less stringent limitations apply.  By way of example, the Boston area exceeds the national standard for carbon monoxide, and to secure a permit the highway proponents would have to show that a major stationary source can achieve the \"lowest achievable emission rate\" for that pollutant.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7503(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Clean Air Act allocates different responsibilities to the EPA on the one hand and to the states on the other.  Each state is directed to adopt and submit to the EPA for approval a state implementation plan to achieve and maintain the national standards established by the EPA.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7410(a).  See also <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Secs. 7471, </span>7502.  If the state fails to adopt an approvable plan, the EPA must adopt federal regulations for the area.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7410(c).  Massachusetts has an approved state implementation plan.  Under the Clean Air Act, \"citizen\" suits may be brought to enjoin a project that requires a permit under Parts C or D but has not obtained one.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7604(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, in April 1991 the Sierra Club and certain of its members sought a preliminary injunction against construction of the central artery and tunnel project.  The request was denied on July 30, 1991.  After transfer of the case to another judge, the district court received further briefing and argument.  On September 16, 1992, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the government defendants, state and federal, holding that the ventilation buildings did not comprise stationary sources subject to pre-construction permit requirements.  The Sierra Club and its named members appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before the lawsuit, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection submitted to the EPA on January 30, 1991, a new regulation--regulation 7.38, codified as 310 C.M.R. Sec. 7.38--as a proposed amendment to the Massachusetts state implementation plan.  This regulation seeks to classify tunnel ventilation systems as \"indirect sources\" under the Clean Air Act.  In the early 1970s, the EPA had begun to require that state implementation plans regulate such facilities as parking lots, highways and garages that do not emit pollutants themselves but attract numbers of polluting vehicles.  Congress responded in 1977 by barring the EPA from regulation of what were called \"indirect sources.\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7410(a)(5)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  However, Congress at the same time gave the states permission, if they so chose, to regulate such indirect sources themselves as part of their state implementation plans.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Sec. 7410(a)(5)(A), </span>(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts, exercising this option through regulation 7.38, proposed to regulate roadway/tunnel ventilation systems as indirect sources.  The regime involves certification by the builder that specified pollution standards will be met, and the Department of Environmental Protection may accept, conditionally approve, or reject the certification after notice and hearing.  Monitoring after construction and periodical renewal of the certificate are required.  The new regulation also states that the systems are not subject to the preconstruction permitting required for various stationary sources under regulation 7.02, 310 C.M.R. Sec. 7.02.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sierra Club opposed the approval of regulation 7.38 when Massachusetts submitted it to the EPA as an amendment to the state implementation plan.  The Sierra Club argued that the effect would be indirectly to relieve the project at issue in this case of the more stringent pre-construction approval required of major stationary sources under the Clean Air Act and the Massachusetts regulations that apply to stationary sources.  After notice and receipt of public comments, the EPA on October 8, 1992, published notice of its approval, 57 Fed.Reg. 46310 (1992).  The Sierra Club then petitioned for review of the EPA's action in this court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7607(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the overlapping issues and common subject, this court consolidated the two appeals taken from the district court judgment with the proceeding for direct review of the EPA action.  In this opinion, we address first a jurisdictional objection raised by the federal defendants, then statutory issues posed by the appeals from the district court, and finally the additional issues posed by the Massachusetts regulations and by the petition to review the EPA's action approving regulation 7.38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal defendants renew in this court their argument, not passed upon below, that the district court \"lacked jurisdiction\" over the complaint against the federal defendants.  The \"citizen suits\" provision of the Clean Air Act permits private suits in three defined classes of cases.  As already noted, it explicitly permits a private suit against anyone who \"proposes to construct\" any major stationary source without a permit required by parts C or D.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7604(a)(3).  The federal defendants deny that they are proposing to construct the project or any part of it;  in other words, they argue that if anyone is subject to suit under subsection (a)(3), it is only Massachusetts officials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute also permits such citizen suits where emission standards or limitations are exceeded, or where the EPA Administrator has failed to perform an act or duty under the Clean Air Act \"which is not discretionary ....\"  42 U.S.C. Secs. 7604(a)(1), (2).  As to these categories, the federal defendants argue that any violations of emission standards or limitations would be those of the state, and that the EPA Administrator cannot be sued for violating a non-discretionary duty since enforcement by the Administrator is inherently a discretionary matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sierra Club, responds, unpersuasively, that any jurisdictional objection has been waived by the failure of the federal defendants to cross appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  More usefully, the Sierra Club urges that the Administrator did violate a non-discretionary duty by failing to take action to enjoin the project, and that in any event the Federal Highway Administration is so closely involved in the funding and planning of this project as to be effectively a party to its construction.  However, like the government brief, the Sierra Club's brief is silent as to what practical implications these questions have in this case where no one has disputed that Massachusetts defendants can be enjoined from construction if a permit is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent some showing that the jurisdictional issue has practical importance in this case, we decline to address it.  Since the Massachusetts officials are subject to suit for constructing the project without a permit, the merits must be reached in any event.  And since we resolve the merits in their favor, the jurisdictional issue as to the federal defendants is pretty close to moot, affecting only the form of the dismissal as to them.  There is ample precedent for by-passing jurisdictional objections when the court can more easily dismiss on the merits.  E.g.,Norton v. Mathews, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109524\"><a href=\"/opinion/109524/norton-v-mathews/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span>, 532, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109524\"><a href=\"/opinion/109524/norton-v-mathews/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span> </a></span>(1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE STATUTORY ISSUES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The merits of the appeals from the district court judgment turn principally on a narrow point of statutory construction, namely, whether the ventilation buildings that will vent the underground highway and harbor tunnel comprise a \"stationary source or sources\" within the meaning the Clean Air Act.  If so labeled, a permit is required;  apparently the amount of pollutant needed to qualify as a \"major\" source is not at issue.  Easily stated, the issue is less easily resolved:  there is little by way of statutory definition, no useful judicial precedent or legislative history offered to us, and a reasonable possibility that Congress never gave any thought to the idiosyncracy posed by these ventilation buildings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting as one normally does with language, parts C and D, which contain the pre-construction permit requirements for major stationary sources, originally contained no definition of stationary source.  Instead part D defines a \"major stationary source\" as \"any stationary facility or source\" emitting the specified quantity of pollutant.  Part C, by cross-reference (see note 1, above), adopts the same language.  Part A, concerned with so-called performance standards, other than air quality standards, did use the term \"stationary source\" in 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7411, defining it as \"any building, structure, facility, or installation which emits or may emit any air pollutant.\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7411(a)(3).  That definition, however, was adopted \"for purposes of this section,\" i.e., section 7411.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus far the breadth of the language appears helpful to the Sierra Club position, since linguistically a ventilation system with a stack could be called a \"facility,\" a \"source\" or even a \"building.\"   The table tilted back the other way in 1977 when Congress amended the Clean Air Act to exclude \"indirect sources\" from mandatory coverage in state implementation plans.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7410(a)(5)(A).  An indirect source is defined in the statute as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>a facility, building, structure, installation, real property, road, or highway which attracts, or may attract, mobile sources of pollution.  Such term includes parking lots, parking garages, and other facilities subject to any measure for management of parking supply....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. Sec. 7410(a)(5)(C).  Asserting that auto makers should bear the brunt of reducing tailpipe emissions, Congress imposed the limitations already described on the EPA efforts to regulate the magnets for vehicles rather than the vehicles themselves.  See H.R.Rep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 219-227 (1977), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1977, 1077, 1298-1306.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although indirect sources are not in terms excluded from the definition of stationary sources--the former provision is cast instead as a limitation on EPA authority--the effect of the amendment is to treat indirect sources as a separate category of sources subject to a different legal regime.  The states may still \"choose[ ]\" to regulate them in state implementation plans, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7410(a)(5)(A)(i), but the decision whether and how to regulate is left largely to the states.  Our best reading of the statute is that, at least after 1977, an indirect source is not to be treated as a stationary source under Parts C and D.  Cf.South Terminal Corp. v. EPA, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"322295\"><a href=\"/opinion/322295/south-terminal-corporation-v-environmental-protection-agency-and-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">646</span></a></span>, 669 (1st Cir.1974) (\"parking structures, which themselves emit no pollutants but instead only attract vehicles which emit pollution, are not stationary sources\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that a stationary source and an indirect source are exclusive categories, the difficult question remains whether ventilation buildings should be assimilated to the former or to the latter.  It is a question that dictionaries cannot answer.  The terms are technical rather than common ones, and they were developed against the background of a complex statute with interlocking provisions and specific goals.  Nor does legislative history furnish any clue as to Congress' intent for ventilation buildings.  Perhaps this small corner among possible applications of the statute was simply overlooked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, it is difficult to derive any clear cut answer from analogy or policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  A covered highway or tunnel with a ventilation system is akin to an uncovered highway or open sided garage--clearly, indirect sources--in multiple senses:  in each instance the facility or space attracts more cars, pollution in the vicinity may be greatly increased, and the initial source of the pollution is the cars themselves.  On the other hand, the possibility exists (no information has been provided to us on the point) that the large scale ventilation systems may be more potent than a highway or garage in concentrating and expelling pollutants in a specific area;  and on this ground, if no other, one might distinguish between them and a facility that is ordinarily ventilated without mechanical aid.  Thus the analogy hardly dispels all doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two other arguments pressed by the parties seem to us inconclusive.  The Sierra Club points us to a new provision, added to Title I in 1990 without limitation as to its application, which for the first time defines stationary source as meaning \"generally any source of an air pollutant except those emissions resulting directly from an internal combustion engine for transportation purposes or from a nonroad engine or nonroad vehicle as defined in section 7550....\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7602(z).  The Sierra Club stresses the word \"directly,\" arguing that the emissions from the ventilation shaft do not fit the \"except\" clause because the auto emissions are emitted first (\"directly,\" in the Sierra Club's view) into the air of the covered highway or tunnel and only then gathered by fans and spewed out through the ventilators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government brief offers its own parsing of this new language, but both sides' arguments about what is \"direct\" and what is an \"indirect\" emission have the flavor of a Medieval dispute in theology.  The reality is that Congress framed this new subsection (z) to deal with an entirely different problem, namely, to include within the stationary source definition mobile sources of pollution, like ships in port and portable asphalt concrete plants, so far as they emit pollutants as part of their stationary activities, e.g., by leaking fuel at dockside (in contrast to engine emissions that occur when the ship or plant travels to a new destination).  S.Rep. No. 228, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 376 (1990).  In other words, Congress was not addressing tunnel ventilation when it drew up this new provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely, we are doubtful about the government's argument based upon the structure of the statute.  Admittedly, Congress did establish two different regimes:  that in Title I, with which we are concerned, governed stationary sources;  that in Title II created a quite different regime, part of which is familiar to anyone who has a car inspected, to regulate vehicle emissions directly.  This symmetry could suggest that tailpipe pollution--the source of the pollutants at issue here--was not meant to fall within Title I at all.  The difficulty is that Congress might not have minded two layers of control, and contrivances like the \"indirect source\" provision in Title I blur the notion that auto pollution is exclusively a Title II problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we think the balance is tipped here by the explicit administrative interpretation of the Clean Air Act adopted by the EPA.  In approving the addition of regulation 7.38 to Massachusetts' state implementation plan, the EPA stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>Tunnel ventilation systems, which do not generate their own emissions but rather simply funnel emissions from mobile sources, are not stationary sources within the meaning of the Clean Air Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">57 Fed.Reg. 46310, 46311 (1992).  The Supreme Court has told us that in construing a statute the courts should ordinarily show a measure of deference to the agency charged with administering the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The case most often cited for that precept is Chevron, which involved a different application of the very same \"stationary source\" provision that is now before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Chevron doctrine has been the subject of much debate and, in subsequent decisions, the Supreme Court may have softened its impact somewhat and in some situations.  See, e.g.,INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111838\"><a href=\"/opinion/111838/ins-v-cardoza-fonseca/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">421</span></a></span>, 448, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111838\"><a href=\"/opinion/111838/ins-v-cardoza-fonseca/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1207</span></a></span>, 1221, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111838\"><a href=\"/opinion/111838/ins-v-cardoza-fonseca/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span> </a></span>(1987).  To be sure, the courts have the last word on statutory interpretation--the question is one of the weight to be accorded to agency views--and often the statute's language or history leaves no latitude for the agency.  In other cases the issue of interpretation may be so central to the operation of the statute that, whether or not Congress' meaning is clear, it is improbable that Congress meant for the courts to defer to the agency.  We do not think these or other qualifications on Chevron deflect its impact here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the contrary, this statute is ambiguous on the issue before us, at least when the words \"stationary source\" are read together with the \"indirect source\" proviso and the structural juxtaposition of Titles I and II.  The application of the stationary and indirect source language to tunnel ventilation is not the heart of the statute but a fringe issue on which Congress did not clearly express its intent.  The Clean Air Act is an immensely complex and technical statute more familiar to the EPA than to anyone else, and the task of making its parts function together harmoniously is entrusted to many actors but above all to the EPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum this is a case in which Chevron and deference to the agency are not make-weights or subsidiary arguments.  Rather, in this fairly debatable case, where statutory language is ambiguous, legislative history is silent and policies and analogies can be and have been mustered on both sides, we think that the EPA's unqualified and precise reading is decisive.  It is unnecessary to calibrate perfectly the weight to be accorded to the agency view in a case of this species:  once \"considerable\" weight is accorded to EPA's reading of the statute, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">seeChevron,</span> <span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">844</span></span>, 104 S.Ct. at 2782, it is enough to tip a set of scales otherwise so closely balanced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>IV. THE MASSACHUSETTS REGULATIONS AND EPA APPROVAL</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our concern with the district court case is not quite over.  Even if Congress did not designate the ventilation facilities in this case as stationary sources, the possibility remains that Massachusetts has adopted in its state implementation plan--and then sought to ignore for its own construction project--pertinent legal restrictions that can be implemented through a suit under the Clean Air Act.  Of course, not every state-law restriction on a project is a matter of federal concern, but a state restriction that is part of a federally approved state implementation plan under the Clean Air Act may at least in some circumstances be within the purview of a citizens suit under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7604.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At one point in its brief, the Sierra Club seems to argue that whatever Congress may have meant by stationary source, Massachusetts in its general permit requirement regulation 7.02, 310 C.M.R. Sec. 7.02, has required pre-construction approval of a class of facilities that includes the ventilation buildings in this case.  One version of regulation 7.02 has been approved by the EPA as part of Massachusetts' state implementation plan.  Although Massachusetts has adopted a later version not yet approved, we will assume arguendo that the original, approved version of the regulation still exists as a matter of federal law and that a violation of this version might well be remedied by a citizen suit under the federal statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty with the Sierra Club's argument, as the government brief points out, is that this regulation on its face applies to a short list of specific facilities (e.g., chemical products manufacturing plants) that do not include highways, tunnels or associated ventilation systems.  The regulation also applies to \"such other facilities as the [state] Department [of Environmental Protection] may require,\" but that state agency has not required pre-construction review of the ventilation buildings under this version of the regulation.  The most that the Sierra Club can extract from the affidavit submitted by the head of the agency is that his agency wobbled over the issue of how to regulate the ventilators at issue in this case, and finally decided to propose the \"indirect source\" regime now embodied in regulation 7.38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regulation 7.38 which now governs tunnel ventilation systems says that they are not subject to regulation 7.02.  We think that this exclusion seeks to remove ambiguity and is very weak evidence that the new version of regulation 7.02 would otherwise cover such systems, and no evidence at all of the meaning of the old version.  Nor do we agree with the Sierra Club that its reading of old regulation 7.02 is borne out by Town of Brookline v. Commissioner of Department of Environmental Quality Engineering, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2159448\"><a href=\"/opinion/2159448/brookline-v-comm-of-the-dept-of-envtl-quality-engg/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span> </span>(1982).  That case involved the application of regulation 7.02 to a diesel fuel-powered facility (in fact, an electrical generating station), which is listed as a facility automatically covered by old regulation 7.02.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To construe the old version of regulation 7.02 definitively is a daunting task, for it was complex, ill-structured, and apparently confusing even to the state agency that administered it.  But the Sierra Club's argument depends upon a showing by it that the old regulation 7.02 did govern highway and tunnel ventilation systems.  Such systems do not fall within the list of specifically named facilities in the regulation.  Similarly, the Sierra Club has not shown that the state agency ever extended that version of the regulation to such systems under the \"may require\" clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the attack on regulation 7.38 that is the subject of the Sierra Club's direct review petition.  One might at first wonder why the Sierra Club is interested in overthrowing a regulation which, if less stringent than the pre-construction permit requirement for major stationary sources, is at least a sizable step in the direction of regulating ventilation systems, a step that the state need not take at all if--as the EPA has ruled--such systems are not stationary sources but merely adjuncts to indirect sources.  Indeed, the EPA's notice approving the new regulation notes that the Conservation Law Foundation endorsed it.  57 Fed.Reg. 46310, 46311 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer is that the Sierra Club, with considerable imagination, has constructed the following argument:  the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act contained a savings clause that sought to forbid states from softening pre-amendment \"control requirement[s]\" in areas that had not attained the national air quality standard for a pollutant, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7515;  the Boston area has admittedly not met these standards for certain pollutants;  and therefore (says the Sierra Club) regulation 7.38 is in violation of the savings clause because it substitutes as to tunnel ventilation systems the softer regime of the new regulation 7.38 for the more stringent, previously applicable regime of regulation 7.02.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will assume without deciding that the savings clause would prevent the weakening of a state implementation plan.  But even so we do not read the savings clause to refer to anything other than an effective, federally approved state implementation plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  It is the older version of regulation 7.02 which alone was federally approved at the time of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.  And, as already explained, the Sierra Club has failed to establish that the pertinent older version of regulation 7.02 did apply to covered highway or tunnel ventilation systems.  Accordingly, regulation 7.38 does not weaken a federally approved state implementation plan but rather strengthens it by extending a new regime to such ventilation systems where previously no federally approved regime applied at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are left with two further arguments in relation to regulation 7.38.  First, it is claimed that regulation 7.38 is invalid because, according to the Sierra Club, the state was required by M.G.L. ch. 111, Sec. 142A, to obtain the approval of the Governor of Massachusetts and the Executive Council but did not do so.  This argument was made, it appears, on the premise that regulation 7.38 was needed by the government defendants in order to remove a bar otherwise presented by regulation 7.02.  As we have seen, the premise is mistaken, and invalidating regulation 7.38 would probably free the ventilation systems from any federally enforceable regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the issue of governor-and-council approval, although irrelevant to the injunction action, is raised by the Sierra Club's petition to review the EPA's approval of the new regulation.  Since the direct review statute has a time limit on petitions, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7607(b)(1), we cannot properly defer decision on the validity of regulation 7.38 to some future point.  Indeed, the EPA in approving the regulation, noted that Massachusetts' Secretary of State had attested that the regulation was properly adopted, and the EPA itself ruled that the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection had authority \"to adopt such regulations without approval by the Governor and Council.\"  57 Fed.Reg. at 46312.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is difficult for anyone but a Massachusetts court to pronounce with certainty on this issue.  But when the regulation is attested by the state secretary as validly adopted and its procedural validity is supported in a brief signed by the state's attorney general, it would take a rather strong showing to persuade us to hold that the regulation is invalid on procedural grounds.  Assuming (as seems likely) that its procedural validity is open to review in this court and that the state secretary's attestation is necessary but not conclusive,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> we think that the EPA correctly concluded that the regulation was properly adopted without the approval of governor and council.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state in submitting regulation 7.38 to the EPA said that it was adopted pursuant to M.G.L. ch. 111, Secs. 142B and 142D, not section 142A.  Section 142B establishes a Boston area pollution control district and gives the Department of Environmental Protection authority to issue rules and regulations to prevent pollution in the district.  Regulation 7.38, which is directed exclusively to the Boston district, appears to fit comfortably within the ambit of section 142B.  The rulemaking provision of section 142B, unlike section 142A, contains no requirement for approval of rules by the state's governor or council.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sierra Club's contrary argument is based on confusing language in M.G.L. ch. 111, Sec. 142A, a broader provision governing air pollution in general.  In its opening sentence, this section says that the Department of Environmental Protection, \"in this section and in sections one hundred and forty-two B to one hundred and forty-two E, inclusive, hereinafter called the department\" may subject to the approval of the governor and council adopt regulations to control pollution.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  The Sierra </span>Club apparently reads this sentence as extending the governor-and-council approval requirement of section 142A to rules made under section 142B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the more natural reading of the quoted language in section 142A is to specify that the term \"department,\" when used without further explanation in the cited later sections, means the Department of Environmental Protection.  Section 142B, for example, does refer only to \"the department.\"   Nor is there anything remarkable about requiring governor-and-council approval for general regulations while not doing so for those directed to a single district;  indeed, the Sierra Club reading would make the grant of rulemaking power in section 142B redundant.  Accordingly, we reject this challenge to the EPA's approval and dismiss the petition to review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government brief construes the Sierra Club's argument to embrace, in addition to the claim just rejected, a further claim that regulation 7.38 cannot be applied \"retroactively\" to the central artery and tunnel at issue in this case.  The regulation by its terms is intended to apply to the project.  See 310 C.M.R. Sec. 7.38(1).  In response the government argues at length that under Massachusetts law whatever retroactivity may be involved in applying the new regime to a previously planned but unbuilt portion of a project is permissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not entirely clear that the Sierra Club is making the argument attributed to it by the government.  However this may be, the EPA did not suggest that its approval of the regulation depended on how or whether it would be applied to existing projects;  the EPA's notice of approval does not discuss retroactivity at all.  There is no reason to suppose that the EPA's approval is at all dependent on the retroactivity issue.  We have no need, in fact no warrant, to decide an issue that is not material either to the district court judgment nor to the validity of the EPA action that is the subject of the petition to review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.   The petition for review is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The definition of \"major stationary source\" in section 7602(j) directly governs permits under part D where the same phrase is used in section 7502(c)(5)'s permit requirement.

Secs. 7475, 7479, but--with qualifications not here relevant--the statute instructs that the terms \"major stationary source\" and \"major emitting facility\" be used interchangeably.  42 U.S.C.

We find little help from a different term used in a different statutory scheme.  Nor do we think that it matters whether, as the Sierra Club asserts, pollution tests or projections done by engineers for the ventilation systems are akin to those done for stationary sources;  presumably, they would also be similar if the system vented a large garage, which is unquestionably an indirect source</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> SeeEnvironmental Protection Agency v.
