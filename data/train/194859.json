William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n                                                    \n\n                                         \n\n                            Before\n\n                    Cyr, Boudin and Stahl,\n                       Circuit Judges.\n                                     \n\n                                         \n\nThomas  E.  Nannicelli   and  Nannicelli  &amp;  Woods  on  brief  for\n                                                  \nappellant.\nRichard T. Rook on brief for appellee, Tooling Research, Inc.\n               \n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per Curiam.   Appellant claims it  did not  receive\n                    \n\ntimely  notice of the denial  of its timely  served motion to\n\namend judgment and for that reason failed to appeal.  Shortly\n\nafter  learning that  the motion  to amend  had been  denied,\n\nappellant asked  the district  court  to reopen  the time  to\n\nappeal under Fed.  R. App.  P. 4(a)(6).   The district  court\n\ndenied the  motion without  stating  any reasons  or  finding\n\nwhether  appellant had been sent  notice of the order denying\n\nthe motion to amend judgment.  Appellant now appeals from the\n\norder denying its motion to reopen.\n\n          We decline to determine whether the  district court\n\nabused its discretion in denying appellant's motion to reopen\n\nthe  time for  appeal, Fed.  R. App.  P. 4(a)(6),  because we\n\nconclude that the time for appealing has not yet commenced to\n\nrun and that therefore a timely appeal may be filed.1\n\n          The  docket  indicates   that  the  district  court\n\nendorsed defendant's timely  served motion to amend  judgment\n\nas denied and entered the denial on April 13, 1992.  There is\n\nno indication that a separate document embodying the order of\n\ndenial  and  complying  with Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  58 was  ever\n\n                    \n\n1.  We note, however, that the district court docket does not\nrecord  notice having been sent  to counsel of  the April 13,\n1992 order denying defendant's motion to amend judgment.  See\n                                                             \nFed. R.  Civ.  P. 77(d) (directing  clerk to serve notice  of\nentry by  mail and  to  \"make a  note in  the  docket of  the\nmailing\").    This circumstance  lends  support  to counsel's\nuncontradicted  statement that  he  did  not  receive  timely\nnotice of the April  13, 1992 order.  In  such circumstances,\nwe  would  benefit from  the  district  court's statement  of\nreasons for denying the motion to reopen the time for appeal.\nSee, e.g., Foster  v. Mydas Associates,  Inc., 943 F.2d  139,\n                                             \n141-42 (1st Cir. 1991) (need for findings or reasons in order\nto afford informed appellate review).\n\nprepared.  Consequently, the time for  appeal has not expired\n\nbecause it has not yet commenced to run.  Fiore v. Washington\n                                                             \n\nCounty Community Mental Health Center, 960 F.2d 229 (1st Cir.\n                                     \n\n1992).   To  be  sure, in  Fiore  we indicated  that  \"absent\n                                \n\nexceptional  circumstances,\" a  party wishing  to  appeal and\n\nwaiting  a separate  document should  ordinarily request  one\n\nwithin  three months  of the  court's last  order lest  he be\n\nfound to have waived his right to appeal.  Fiore, 960 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n236 and n.11.   Here, however, where counsel's uncontradicted\n\naffidavit  states that he did not receive notice of the April\n\n13, 1992 entry, the  district court docket supports counsel's\n\nposition  (see note one), and the district court did not find\n\nthat notice was timely  sent, we cannot say that  the failure\n\nto appeal was \"a matter of choice, not confusion,\" Fiore, 960\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 236 n.11, and we think exceptional  circumstances are\n\npresent.     Therefore,   waiver  will   not   be   inferred.\n\nConsequently, as  the separate document  requirement has  not\n\nbeen satisfied, the time for appealing from the July 29, 1991\n\njudgment  and April  13,  1992 order  has  not expired.    We\n\ntherefore affirm  the district court's denial  of appellant's\n\nmotion to reopen, but  on the ground that no  such motion was\n\nrequired since the  time for appeal had not run.   See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nIn  re Parque  Forestal, Inc.,  949 F.2d  504, 510  (1st Cir.\n                             \n\n1991) (a reviewing court may affirm on grounds different from\n\nthose used by the lower court).\n\n                             -3-\n\n          Appellant's   August  25,  1992  motion  to  reopen\n\nmanifests an  intention  to appeal  from  the July  29,  1991\n\njudgment and  April 13, 1992 order.   As no purpose  would be\n\nserved by requiring  appellant to file  yet another piece  of\n\npaper labelled notice of appeal, we will treat the August 25,\n\n1992  motion as a notice  of appeal.

Barksdale,\n                                                            \n\n823 F.2d 981, 983 (6th Cir. 1987) (document meeting Rule 3(c)\n\nrequirements and  manifesting an  intention to appeal  may be\n\ntreated  as a  notice of  appeal); Stallworth v.  Shuler, 758\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  1409 (11th Cir. 1985).   We transmit  the motion to the\n\nclerk of the district court with instructions to docket it as\n\na notice of appeal and to certify the record to this court.\n\n          Pursuant to First Circuit  Rule 27.1, the March 15,\n\n1993  order is  summarily affirmed.   Appellees'  request for\n\ndamages and costs under Fed. R. App. 38 is denied.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -4-\n",
