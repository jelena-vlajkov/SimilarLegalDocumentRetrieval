We have reviewed  carefully the record, the\n               \n\ndistrict court opinion, and the parties' briefs in this case.\n\nWe summarily  affirm the district  court judgment essentially\n\nfor the reasons  stated in its  memorandum of decision  dated\n\nMarch 29, 1994.  See  1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.  We add only the\n                    \n\nfollowing.\n\n     Even if we assume  that appellant properly raised before\n\nthe  district  court  a  claim that  he  had  been wrongfully\n\nterminated  in violation  of  a state  public policy  against\n\ndismissal of an  employee who  has only been  charged with  a\n\ncrime, we  find no merit in  the claim.  The  general rule in\n\nMassachusetts is that \"[e]mployment  at will is terminable by\n\neither  the  employee or  the  employer  without notice,  for\n\nalmost  any reason  or for  no reason  at all.\"   Jackson  v.\n                                                         \n\nAction for  Boston Community Development, Inc.,  403 Mass. 8,\n                                             \n\n9,  525 N.E.2d 411, 412  (1988).  Although  a \"public policy\"\n\nexception  to the  employment  at will  doctrine exists,  the\n\nexception is  \"interpreted . . . narrowly,\" King v. Driscoll,\n                                                            \n\n1994  Mass. LEXIS  474,  at 11  (Mass.  Aug. 11,  1994),  and\n\nrequires  a showing  that the  dismissal violated  a \"clearly\n\nestablished public policy,\" id. at 10. \n                              \n\n     Appellant asserts that his dismissal  violated the state\n\npolicy which presumes an accused  to be innocent until proven\n\nguilty.  This presumption, however, serves to focus a jury on\n\nwhat a prosecutor must establish so as to obtain a conviction\n\nin a criminal  case.   Commonwealth v. Boyd,  367 Mass.  169,\n                                           \n\n188, 326  N.E.2d 320, 332 (1975) (emphasis added).  It has no\n\napplicability  in the  employment context  and, consequently,\n\ndoes not  warrant invocation of the  public policy exception.\n\nSee  Borschel v.  City of  Perry, 512  N.W.2d 565,  568 (Iowa\n                                \n\n1994)   (presumption  of   innocence  \"limited   to  criminal\n\nprocedures\" and  is not  \"a public  policy applicable in  the\n\nemployment context\"); Cisco v. United  Parcel Services, Inc.,\n                                                           \n\n328 Pa. Super. 300,  476 A.2d 1340, 1344 (1984)  (presumption\n\nof innocence applies to  trial and is not  \"superimposed into\n\nan accused's  remaining life  experiences\");  see also  King,\n                                                            \n\nsupra, at 15 (statutory  right \"must relate to or  arise from\n     \n\nthe employee's  status as an employee\"  to warrant invocation\n\nof public policy exception).  Furthermore,           although\n\nMassachusetts does not appear  to have directly addressed the\n\nquestion of whether a  dismissal of an employee on  the basis\n\nof a mere accusation  is a violation of public  policy, other\n\nstates  which have  addressed similar  claims have  held that\n\nsuch a dismissal is  not a violation of  public policy.   See\n                                                             \n\nBeery v. Maryland  Medical Laboratory, Inc., 89 Md.
