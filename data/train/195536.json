Torres-Gonzales was\n\nnamed  in   twenty-four  counts  of   a  twenty-seven   count\n\nindictment returned  on November  1,  1990.   The  indictment\n\ncharged  him  with  conspiracy  to  possess  with  intent  to\n\ndistribute  over  five  kilograms  of  cocaine,  one  hundred\n\nkilograms of marijuana,  and one kilogram  of heroin, see  21\n                                                         \n\nU.S.C.    841(a)(1), 846; making false statements in passport\n\napplications, see 18  U.S.C.   1542;  importing four  hundred\n                 \n\nand seventy-five kilograms of cocaine into the United States,\n\nsee 21  U.S.C.    952, 960 and 18 U.S.C.   2; possessing with\n   \n\nintent  to  distribute  the  four  hundred  and  seventy-five\n\nkilograms  of cocaine, see 21 U.S.C. 841 (a)(1) and 18 U.S.C.\n                          \n\n  2;  failing to file  United States Customs  reporting forms\n\nwith  regard to the exportation of  $100,000 in United States\n\ncurrency, see 31 U.S.C.    5316, 5322(b), and 18  U.S.C.   2;\n             \n\nstructuring  cash transactions  involving $100,000  in United\n\nStates currency, see 31 U.S.C.    5313, 5324, and 18 U.S.C.  \n                    \n\n2; and continuing criminal  enterprise, see 21 U.S.C.    848.\n                                           \n\nBased onthese charges,appellant faced apossible lifesentence.\n\n     In December 1990 or January 1991, appellant agreed to be\n\ndebriefed by the  government.  The  preliminary agreement  he\n\nentered into  with the  government provided  that he  was not\n\nentitled at that juncture  to any \"specific consideration\" in\n\nexchange for providing  a statement.  Sometime in  January or\n\nFebruary  1991,  then-prosecutor  De Jesus  informed  defense\n\ncounsel that, \"at that moment,\" he was willing to recommend a\n\nfifteen-year  term  of  imprisonment  based   on  appellant's\n\ncooperation.    When  defense   counsel  later  brought  this\n\nstatement to  the attention  of prosecutor Gil,  lead counsel\n\nfor  the government,  Gil  informed him  that the  government\n\nwould  not  make  such  a  recommendation.    By  that  time,\n\nprosecutor De Jesus was  no longer involved in the  case.  On\n\nJanuary   31,  1992,  Torres-Gonzalez  entered  into  a  plea\n\nagreement with the government under  which he agreed to plead\n\nguilty to the pre-Sentencing Guidelines offense of continuing\n\ncriminal enterprise, and the government agreed to dismiss the\n\nremaining   counts   and   to   recommend   eighteen   years'\n\nimprisonment.    The  district  court  subsequently  accepted\n\nappellant's guilty plea and, on  May 11, 1992, sentenced  him\n\nto eighteen years' imprisonment.   Appellant did not directly\n\nappeal his conviction or sentence.\n\n     On August 6,  1993, appellant filed a motion  to correct\n\nhis  sentence, pursuant to Fed.  R. Crim. P.  35(a), based on\n\nthe first prosecutor's  \"offer\" to  recommend fifteen  years'\n\nimprisonment.  Appellant also expressed great remorse for his\n\nactions and  requested that  the district court  exercise its\n\nleniency  to reduce the sentence to fifteen years.  On August\n\n                             -3-\n\n12, 1993, the district  court denied the motion.   On October\n\n25, 1993, appellant filed a motion for reconsideration of the\n\ndenial  of his Rule 35(a) motion, this time alleging that the\n\nplea agreement that he ultimately reached with the government\n\nwas  unconstitutionally coerced.   On  December 2,  1993, the\n\ndistrict court  denied the motion for  reconsideration.  This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                             II.\n\n     On appeal, Torres-Gonzalez advances an argument based on\n\ncontract principles.   He concedes that,  as a general  rule,\n\nthe government may unilaterally  withdraw a plea offer before\n\nit has  been approved by  the district court.   See  Mabry v.\n                                                          \n\nJohnson,  467 U.S.  504, 506-08 (1984).   However,  he argues\n       \n\nthat the government is bound by  such an offer if a defendant\n\nworsens his position in reliance on it.  See United States v.\n                                                          \n\nPapaleo,  853 F.2d 16, 18-19  (1st Cir. 1988) (observing that\n       \n\ndue process concerns may arise when a defendant detrimentally\n\nrelies  upon  a  government  promise and  stating  that  plea\n\nagreements are  governed by  contract principles).   Although\n\nthe further details  of his argument are not  entirely clear,\n\nappellant appears  to contend  that the  government initially\n\npromised  him   a  lenient  sentence  in   exchange  for  his\n\ncooperation  and  later  agreed  to  recommend  a  \"lenient,\"\n\nfifteen-year sentence  based on his cooperation.   He further\n\nargues that  the government's promise to  recommend a lenient\n\n                             -4-\n\nsentence  induced him  to  cooperate with  the government  by\n\nmaking   a   statement   and   by    surrendering   property.\n\nConsequently,  he   argues,  he  is   entitled  to   specific\n\nperformance by  the government of its  \"promise\" to recommend\n\nfifteen years' imprisonment.  \n\n     At  the  outset,  we  observe that  it  is  questionable\n\nwhether we  have jurisdiction over this  appeal.  Appellant's\n\nRule 35(a) motion,  filed on  August 6, 1993,  was denied  on\n\nAugust  12, 1993.   The  time period  for appealing  from the\n\ndenial of a Rule 35(a) motion  is ten days.  Fed. R.  App. P.\n\n4(b).   Appellant's  notice of  appeal  was not  filed  until\n\nDecember 17, 1993, obviously well beyond this ten-day period.\n\nAlthough a  motion for reconsideration filed  within the time\n\nperiod allotted for the filing of  a notice of an appeal will\n\nextend the time for filing a notice of appeal, the October 25\n\nmotion  for  reconsideration  was  filed  beyond the  ten-day\n\nperiod and  was  therefore untimely.   See  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nCarr, 932 F.2d 67,  70 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 112 S.  Ct.\n                                                \n\n112 (1991); United States v. Russo, 760 F.2d 1229, 1230 (11th\n                                  \n\nCir. 1985).  Consequently, the motion for reconsideration did\n\nnot  extend the time for  appeal from the  Rule 35(a) denial,\n\nand  this court  is also  apparently without  jurisdiction to\n\n                             -5-\n\nreview  the  district  court's   denial  of  the  motion  for\n\nreconsideration.  See Russo, 760 F.2d at 1230.1  \n                           \n\n     Arguably, appellant's  October 25 motion  advances a new\n\nground to set aside his sentence and could be construed  as a\n\ntimely second Rule 35(a)  motion or as a timely  first motion\n\nto  vacate, correct, or set aside his sentence pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C.    2255.2   Cf.  United States  v.  Zuleta-Molina, 840\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 157, 158 (1st Cir. 1988) (observing that the merits of a\n\nfederal pro se prisoner's claims need not be circumscribed by\n              \n\nthe  label attached  to  his pleadings).   However,  assuming\n\nwithout deciding  that we  have jurisdiction over  the appeal\n\nfrom the denial of  the October 25 motion, appellant  faces a\n\ndifferent  hurdle.   The detrimental  reliance argument  that\n\nappellant  advances  on  appeal  was  not  presented  to  the\n\n                    \n\n1.  In  light of  our determination  that appellant  does not\nhave a timely appeal from the denial of his  August 6 motion,\nwe need  not address  whether Rule  35(a) was an  appropriate\nvehicle for  this motion,  or, relatedly, whether  the motion\nwas timely filed.\n\n2.  Under  the  version  of  Rule 35(a)  applicable  to  pre-\nSentencing Guideline cases, the court \"may correct an illegal\nsentence at any time.\"  The government questions whether this\nrule  is a  source  of authority  to  provide relief  from  a\nsentence  allegedly  imposed   after  an   unconstitutionally\ncoerced  plea agreement.  We  need not decide  whether such a\nsentence  is  an \"illegal  sentence\"  within  the meaning  of\nformer Rule 35(a) because, as  noted above, the motion  could\nalso  be  construed as  a  collateral  attack on  appellant's\nconviction,  which  also may  be brought  at  any time.   Cf.\n                                                             \nUnited  States v.  Flenory, 876  F.2d 10,  11 (3d  Cir. 1989)\n                          \n(declining  to  decide  whether Rule  35(a)  is  a source  of\nauthority to  afford relief from  breach of a  plea agreement\nwhere  the Rule 35(a) motion  could be construed  as a   2255\nmotion). \n\n                             -6-\n\ndistrict  court,  and hence  is  deemed waived.    See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nSandstrom  v. Chemlawn Corp., 904 F.2d 83, 86 (1st Cir. 1990)\n                            \n\n(arguments not made to the district court are waived).\n\n     We  add  that, in  any  event, the  arguments  raised on\n\nappeal appear unavailing.   We observe, first,  that there is\n\nno  support whatsoever  in the  record for  appellant's claim\n\nthat  the  prosecution  initially   promised  him  a  lenient\n\nsentence.  Even  were we  to assume that  such a promise  had\n\nbeen made,  we would  reject appellant's contention  that the\n\ngovernment  breached this  \"promise\"  when it  recommended an\n\neighteen-year  sentence instead  of a  fifteen-year sentence.\n\nEither recommendation was relatively lenient in comparison to\n\nthe potential life sentence appellant faced.\n\n     Second,  although it  is undisputed  that in  January or\n\nFebruary   1991,   then-prosecutor   De  Jesus   stated   his\n\nwillingness,  \"at that moment,\"  to recommend  fifteen years'\n\nincarceration,  it  is  by  no  means  clear that  De  Jesus'\n\nstatement constituted a firm offer or promise to do so.   See\n                                                             \n\nSantoni  v. FDIC,  677  F.2d 174,  179  (1st Cir.  1982)  (an\n                \n\nestoppel  claim must be  supported by a  definite and certain\n\npromise).    Assuming,  arguendo, that  it  did,  appellant's\n                                \n\ndetrimental  reliance  argument  still  fails.   By  his  own\n\nadmission  and  version  of  events,  the  cooperation  which\n\nappellant  claims  was  induced  by De  Jesus'  \"offer,\"  was\n\ncompleted  before  any  specific  number of  years  was  ever\n\n                             -7-\n\nmentioned.  Under the  circumstances, it cannot be  said that\n\nappellant  relied upon  any promise  to recommend  a specific\n\nterm of incarceration.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -8-\n",

Torres-Gonzales was named in twenty-four counts of a twenty-seven count indictment returned on November 1, 1990.  The indictment charged him with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute over five kilograms of cocaine, one hundred kilograms of marijuana, and one kilogram of heroin, see 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1), 846; making false statements in passport applications, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1542;  importing four hundred and seventy-five kilograms of cocaine into the United States, see 21 U.S.C.

Sec. 2;  failing to file United States Customs reporting forms with regard to the exportation of $100,000 in United States currency, see 31 U.S.C. Secs. 5316, 5322(b), and 18 U.S.C.

Sec. 848.  Based on these charges, appellant faced a possible life sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1990 or January 1991, appellant agreed to be debriefed by the government.  The preliminary agreement he entered into with the government provided that he was not entitled at that juncture to any \"specific consideration\" in exchange for providing a statement.  Sometime in January or February 1991, then-prosecutor De Jesus informed defense counsel that, \"at that moment,\" he was willing to recommend a fifteen-year term of imprisonment based on appellant's cooperation.  When defense counsel later brought this statement to the attention of prosecutor Gil, lead counsel for the government, Gil informed him that the government would not make such a recommendation.  By that time, prosecutor De Jesus was no longer involved in the case.  On January 31, 1992, Torres- Gonzalez entered into a plea agreement with the government under which he agreed to plead guilty to the pre-Sentencing Guidelines offense of continuing criminal enterprise, and the government agreed to dismiss the remaining counts and to recommend eighteen years' imprisonment.  The district court subsequently accepted appellant's guilty plea and, on May 11, 1992, sentenced him to eighteen years' imprisonment.  Appellant did not directly appeal his conviction or sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 6, 1993, appellant filed a motion to correct his sentence, pursuant to Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 35(a), based on the first prosecutor's \"offer\" to recommend fifteen years' imprisonment.  Appellant also expressed great remorse for his actions and requested that the district court exercise its leniency to reduce the sentence to fifteen years.  On August 12, 1993, the district court denied the motion.  On October 25, 1993, appellant filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial of his Rule 35(a) motion, this time alleging that the plea agreement that he ultimately reached with the government was unconstitutionally coerced.  On December 2, 1993, the district court denied the motion for reconsideration.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Torres-Gonzalez advances an argument based on contract principles.  He concedes that, as a general rule, the government may unilaterally withdraw a plea offer before it has been approved by the district court.   See Mabry v. Johnson, 467 U.S. 504, 506-08 (1984).  However, he argues that the government is bound by such an offer if a defendant worsens his position in reliance on it.   See United States v. Papaleo, 853 F.2d 16, 18-19 (1st Cir. 1988) (observing that due process concerns may arise when a defendant detrimentally relies upon a government promise and stating that plea agreements are governed by contract principles).  Although the further details of his argument are not entirely clear, appellant appears to contend that the government initially promised him a lenient sentence in exchange for his cooperation and later agreed to recommend a \"lenient,\" fifteen-year sentence based on his cooperation.  He further argues that the government's promise to recommend a lenient sentence induced him to cooperate with the government by making a statement and by surrendering property.  Consequently, he argues, he is entitled to specific performance by the government of its \"promise\" to recommend fifteen years' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, we observe that it is questionable whether we have jurisdiction over this appeal.  Appellant's Rule 35(a) motion, filed on August 6, 1993, was denied on August 12, 1993.  The time period for appealing from the denial of a Rule 35(a) motion is ten days.  Fed. R. App.  P. 4(b).  Appellant's notice of appeal was not filed until December 17, 1993, obviously well beyond this ten-day period.  Although a motion for reconsideration filed within the time period allotted for the filing of a notice of an appeal will extend the time for filing a notice of appeal, the October 25 motion for reconsideration was filed beyond the ten-day period and was therefore untimely.   See United States v. Carr, 932 F.2d 67, 70 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 112 (1991);   United States v. Russo, 760 F.2d 1229, 1230 (11th Cir. 1985).  Consequently, the motion for reconsideration did not extend the time for appeal from the Rule 35(a) denial, and this court is also apparently without jurisdiction to review the district court's denial of the motion for reconsideration.   See Russo, 760 F.2d at 1230.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arguably, appellant's October 25 motion advances a new ground to set aside his sentence and could be construed as a timely second Rule 35(a) motion or as a timely first motion to vacate, correct, or set aside his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>   Cf. United States v. Zuleta-Molina, 840 F.2d 157, 158 (1st Cir. 1988) (observing that the merits of a federal pro se prisoner's claims need not be circumscribed by the label attached to his pleadings).  However, assuming without deciding that we have jurisdiction over the appeal from the denial of the October 25 motion, appellant faces a different hurdle.  The detrimental reliance argument that appellant advances on appeal was not presented to the district court, and hence is deemed waived.   See, e.g., Sandstrom v. Chemlawn Corp., 904 F.2d 83, 86 (1st Cir. 1990) (arguments not made to the district court are waived).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that, in any event, the arguments raised on appeal appear unavailing.  We observe, first, that there is no support whatsoever in the record for appellant's claim that the prosecution initially promised him a lenient sentence.  Even were we to assume that such a promise had been made, we would reject appellant's contention that the government breached this \"promise\" when it recommended an eighteen-year sentence instead of a fifteen-year sentence.  Either recommendation was relatively lenient in comparison to the potential life sentence appellant faced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, although it is undisputed that in January or February 1991, then-prosecutor De Jesus stated his willingness, \"at that moment,\" to recommend fifteen years' incarceration, it is by no means clear that De Jesus' statement constituted a firm offer or promise to do so.   See Santoni v. FDIC, 677 F.2d 174, 179 (1st Cir. 1982) (an estoppel claim must be supported by a definite and certain promise).  Assuming, arguendo, that it did, appellant's detrimental reliance argument still fails.  By his own admission and version of events, the cooperation which appellant claims was induced by De Jesus' \"offer,\" was completed before any specific number of years was ever mentioned.  Under the circumstances, it cannot be said that appellant relied upon any promise to recommend a specific term of incarceration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In light of our determination that appellant does not have a timely appeal from the denial of his August 6 motion, we need not address whether Rule 35(a) was an appropriate vehicle for this motion, or, relatedly, whether the motion was timely filed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Under the version of Rule 35(a) applicable to pre- Sentencing Guideline cases, the court \"may correct an illegal sentence at any time.\"  The government questions whether this rule is a source of authority to provide relief from a sentence allegedly imposed after an unconstitutionally coerced plea agreement.  We need not decide whether such a sentence is an \"illegal sentence\" within the meaning of former Rule 35(a) because, as noted above, the motion could also be construed as a collateral attack on appellant's conviction, which also may be brought at any time.

Flenory, 876 F.2d 10, 11 (3d Cir. 1989) (declining to decide whether Rule 35(a) is a source of authority to afford relief from breach of a plea agreement where the Rule 35(a) motion could be construed as a Sec. 2255 motion)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

R. App.  P. 35(a), as well as from the court's order denying his motion for reconsideration.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are undisputed.  Torres-Gonzales was named in twenty-four counts of a twenty-seven count indictment returned on November 1, 1990.  The indictment charged him with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute over five kilograms of cocaine, one hundred kilograms of marijuana, and one kilogram of heroin, see 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1), 846; making false statements in passport applications, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1542;  importing four hundred and seventy-five kilograms of cocaine into the United States, see 21 U.S.C. Secs. 952, 960 and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2;  possessing with intent to distribute the four hundred and seventy-five kilograms of cocaine, see 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2;  failing to file United States Customs reporting forms with regard to the exportation of $100,000 in United States currency, see 31 U.S.C. Secs. 5316, 5322(b), and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2;  structuring cash transactions involving $100,000 in United States currency, see 31 U.S.C. Secs. 5313, 5324, and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2;  and continuing criminal enterprise, see 21 U.S.C. Sec. 848.  Based on these charges, appellant faced a possible life sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1990 or January 1991, appellant agreed to be debriefed by the government.  The preliminary agreement he entered into with the government provided that he was not entitled at that juncture to any \"specific consideration\" in exchange for providing a statement.  Sometime in January or February 1991, then-prosecutor De Jesus informed defense counsel that, \"at that moment,\" he was willing to recommend a fifteen-year term of imprisonment based on appellant's cooperation.  When defense counsel later brought this statement to the attention of prosecutor Gil, lead counsel for the government, Gil informed him that the government would not make such a recommendation.  By that time, prosecutor De Jesus was no longer involved in the case.  On January 31, 1992, Torres- Gonzalez entered into a plea agreement with the government under which he agreed to plead guilty to the pre-Sentencing Guidelines offense of continuing criminal enterprise, and the government agreed to dismiss the remaining counts and to recommend eighteen years' imprisonment.  The district court subsequently accepted appellant's guilty plea and, on May 11, 1992, sentenced him to eighteen years' imprisonment.  Appellant did not directly appeal his conviction or sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 6, 1993, appellant filed a motion to correct his sentence, pursuant to Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 35(a), based on the first prosecutor's \"offer\" to recommend fifteen years' imprisonment.  Appellant also expressed great remorse for his actions and requested that the district court exercise its leniency to reduce the sentence to fifteen years.  On August 12, 1993, the district court denied the motion.  On October 25, 1993, appellant filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial of his Rule 35(a) motion, this time alleging that the plea agreement that he ultimately reached with the government was unconstitutionally coerced.  On December 2, 1993, the district court denied the motion for reconsideration.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Torres-Gonzalez advances an argument based on contract principles.  He concedes that, as a general rule, the government may unilaterally withdraw a plea offer before it has been approved by the district court.   See Mabry v. Johnson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111208\"><a href=\"/opinion/111208/mabry-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span>, 506-08 (1984).  However, he argues that the government is bound by such an offer if a defendant worsens his position in reliance on it.   See United States v. Papaleo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509521\"><a href=\"/opinion/509521/united-states-v-antonio-papaleo/\"><span class=\"volume\">853</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 18-19 (1st Cir. 1988) (observing that due process concerns may arise when a defendant detrimentally relies upon a government promise and stating that plea agreements are governed by contract principles).  Although the further details of his argument are not entirely clear, appellant appears to contend that the government initially promised him a lenient sentence in exchange for his cooperation and later agreed to recommend a \"lenient,\" fifteen-year sentence based on his cooperation.  He further argues that the government's promise to recommend a lenient sentence induced him to cooperate with the government by making a statement and by surrendering property.  Consequently, he argues, he is entitled to specific performance by the government of its \"promise\" to recommend fifteen years' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, we observe that it is questionable whether we have jurisdiction over this appeal.
