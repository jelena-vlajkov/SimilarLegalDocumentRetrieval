The implicated portions  of the applicable\r\nstatutes are as follows:\r\n\n          Whoever,  by   force  and  violence,   or  by\r\n          intimidation,  takes,  or  attempts to  take,\r\n          from the person or presence of another . .  .\r\n          any property  or money or any  other thing of\r\n          value belonging to, or in the  care, custody,\r\n          control,  management,  or possession  of, any\r\n          [federally  insured] bank  .  . .  [shall  be\r\n          punished as provided by law].\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   2113(a) (1988).\r\n\n          Whoever, in committing,  or in attempting  to\r\n          commit, any  offense defined in  [  2113(a)],\r\n          puts in  jeopardy the  life of any  person by\r\n          the  use of  a  dangerous  weapon or  device,\r\n          shall be . . . [punished as provided by law].\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   2113(d) (1988).\r\n\n          Whoever, during and in  relation to any crime\r\n          of  violence  .  .  .  for  which  he  may be\r\n          prosecuted in  a court of the  United States,\r\n          uses or  carries a  firearm, shall  . .  . be\r\n          [subjected to additional punishment].\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   924(c)(1) (1988).\r\n\n          Whoever commits an offense against the United\r\n          States  or  aids, abets,  counsels, commands,\r\n          induces  or  procures   its  commission,   is\r\n          punishable as a principal.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   2(a) (1988).\r\n\n          As  the text  indicates,  a conviction  for armed  bank\r\nrobbery,  18 U.S.C.     2113(d), necessarily  signifies that  the\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nsimilarities,  require  the   application  of  dissimilar   legal\r\n\nstandards.  Because the evidence  amassed by the government falls\r\n\nbetween these stools, we affirm the first conviction  but reverse\r\n\nthe second.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We limn the pertinent facts in the light most favorable\r\n\nto the government, see United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 710-\r                                                       \r\n\n11 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied,  113 S. Ct. 1005 (1993), paying\r                                          \r\n\nparticular  heed  to those  details  that  arguably reflect  what\r\n\nappellant knew and when he knew it.\r\n\n          On August 20, 1991, at  around 3:00 p.m., Gerald Mohan,\r\n\na conscientious FBI agent, noticed appellant (a person previously\r\n\nknown to him)  sitting on  the steps of  the Federal Building  in\r\n\nLowell,  Massachusetts.   Mohan  decided  to  mount an  impromptu\r\n\nsurveillance.    As  he  was  positioning  his  vehicle,  a  blue\r\n\nOldsmobile arrived at  the scene.   After  appellant entered  the\r\n\nOldsmobile,  it made several quick  turns and then  pulled to the\r\n\ncurb.  The driver (subsequently  identified as Paul Kirvan) moved\r\n\ninto  the  front passenger  seat  and appellant  took  the wheel.\r\n\nKirvan and appellant proceeded  to criss-cross the streets around\r\n\nthe  Lowell Institution for Savings (the  Bank).  Mohan testified\r\n\nthat the pair's driving pattern appeared to  be part of a process\r\n\nof careful scrutiny.\r\n\n          Roughly fifteen minutes  after beginning  surveillance,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\ngovernment has proved the elements of the lesser included offense\r\nof unarmed bank robbery, 18 U.S.C.   2113(a).\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nMohan  followed  the  Oldsmobile  to  Academy  Drive.    There he\r\n\nobserved  a  classic   getaway  \"switch  site\"  on   a  dead  end\r\n\napproximately 0.3 miles from the Bank.  Appellant and Kirvan next\r\n\nreturned to the  vicinity of  the Federal Building.   On  Fayette\r\n\nStreet,  Kirvan alighted  from the  Oldsmobile (which  he owned),\r\n\nentered a parked Chevrolet Monte Carlo (later ascertained to have\r\n\nbeen stolen some  distance away),  and began  driving toward  the\r\n\nBank.    Appellant followed  him  in  the  Oldsmobile, and  Mohan\r\n\nfollowed both of them,  caravan-style, in his own vehicle.   When\r\n\nthe two  drivers veered in separate directions,  Mohan lost sight\r\n\nof both  cars.  He circled in the general vicinity and, some four\r\n\nminutes  later, glimpsed  the  Chevrolet at  a standstill  in the\r\n\nBank's parking lot.\r\n\n          Mohan made a U-turn and  headed back to the Bank.   His\r\n\nefforts were  unavailing; at  that precise moment,  the Chevrolet\r\n\naccelerated  rapidly out of the parking lot and passed him (going\r\n\nin the  opposite direction).  Kirvan was alone in the car.  Mohan\r\n\nmade yet another U-turn and unsuccessfully gave chase.\r\n\n          At approximately 3:25 p.m., ostensibly during the brief\r\n\ninterval in which Mohan lost track of his quarry, a masked Kirvan\r\n\nentered the  Bank, instructed those  present not to  move, jumped\r\n\nover  the tellers' counter, stuffed  the contents of several cash\r\n\ndrawers  into a  garbage bag,  leapt back  over the  counter, and\r\n\nfled.  Although Kirvan  brandished a handgun at the height of the\r\n\nrobbery,  a teller testified that the weapon was not visible when\r\n\nhe entered the Bank.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n          Other percipient witnesses reported that, mid-afternoon\r\n\nof the  same day,  they saw  a Chevrolet  Monte Carlo speed  down\r\n\nAcademy  Drive.  Two  men, one  holding a  bag, emerged  from the\r\n\nvehicle, crossed through two  gates, and drove away in  a waiting\r\n\nblue car.  The  witnesses were unable to identify  either suspect\r\n\npositively, although one of the men \"looked like\" appellant.  The\r\n\nLowell police recovered the Chevrolet that afternoon.  They found\r\n\nKirvan's blue Oldsmobile the next morning, abandoned not far from\r\n\nthe switch site.\r\n\n          The  government established  that appellant  and Kirvan\r\n\nhad been close friends for many years.  Telephone   toll  records\r\n\nreflected seventy-three calls between the men's residences in the\r\n\nnineteen days  preceding the  robbery, including eleven  calls on\r\n\nAugust 19.\r\n\n          A federal  grand jury  indicted appellant on  counts of\r\n\ncounts of conspiracy to commit bank  robbery, see 18 U.S.C.   371\r                                                           \r\n\n(which count was  later dismissed), aiding and abetting  an armed\r\n\nbank  robbery, see 18 U.S.C.    2113(d), and  aiding and abetting\r                            \r\n\nthe  use  of a  firearm  during and  in  relation to  a  crime of\r\n\nviolence,  see  18 U.S.C.    924(c).    A jury  trial eventuated.\r                        \r\n\nAfter appellant unsuccessfully moved  for judgment of  acquittal,\r\n\nthe jurors returned  a guilty verdict  on each remaining  count.2\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2In a separate proceeding before a different judge and jury,\r\nKirvan  was convicted of armed bank robbery  and use of a firearm\r\nduring and in relation  to a crime of violence.   Notwithstanding\r\nthe  verdict, the judge ordered an acquittal on the latter count.\r\nWe affirmed the armed bank robbery conviction and  reinstated the\r\nfirearms conviction.  See  United States v. Kirvan, 997  F.2d 963\r                                                            \r\n(1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nThe court sentenced appellant  to serve 262 months in  prison for\r\n\narmed  robbery and  imposed a  mandatory sixty-month  consecutive\r\n\nsentence  in  respect  to  the  firearms  charge.    This  appeal\r\n\nfollowed.\r\n\nII.  ARMED BANK ROBBERY\r          II.  ARMED BANK ROBBERY\r\n\n          Appellant  challenges the  sufficiency of  the evidence\r\n\nsupporting   his   conviction  on   count   2.     Our   task  is\r\n\nstraightforward.  We must  ascertain whether, \"after assaying all\r\n\nthe evidence in  the light  most amiable to  the government,  and\r\n\ntaking  all  reasonable  inferences  in  its  favor,  a  rational\r\n\nfactfinder  could  find,  beyond  a reasonable  doubt,  that  the\r\n\nprosecution  successfully proved  the  essential elements  of the\r\n\ncrime.\"  United  States v.  O'Brien, 14 F.3d  703, 706 (1st  Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1994).    In  performing  this task,  we  do  not  pass  upon the\r\n\ncredibility  of witnesses,  see id.,  nor do  we demand  that the\r                                             \r\n\ngovernment   disprove  every   hypothesis  consistent   with  the\r\n\ndefendant's innocence,  see United States v.  Echeverri, 982 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n675, 677 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n          The  jury reached its verdict in this case on the basis\r\n\nof circumstantial evidence.  Reliance  on indirect, as opposed to\r\n\ndirect,  evidence in  a  criminal case  is  both permissible  and\r\n\ncommonplace.   See O'Brien, 14  F.3d at 706  (observing that \"the\r                                    \r\n\ncriminal  law  does  not  place  a  special   premium  on  direct\r\n\nevidence\").  In making  such judgments, \"juries are not  required\r\n\nto examine the evidence  in isolation, for `individual  pieces of\r\n\nevidence, insufficient  in themselves  to prove a  point, may  in\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\ncumulation prove it.'\"  Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 711 (quoting Bourjaily\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. United States,  483 U.S.  171, 179-80 (1987)).   Thus, when  a\r                          \r\n\njury draws inferences  from circumstantial evidence, a  reviewing\r\n\ncourt should refrain from second-guessing the ensuing conclusions\r\n\nas long as  (1) the  inferences derive support  from a  plausible\r\n\nrendition of  the record, and (2) the conclusions flow rationally\r\n\nfrom those inferences.  See id.\r                                         \r\n\n          We add a  cautionary note.  Despite the  deference that\r\n\ncharacterizes appellate  review of  jury verdicts, juries  do not\r\n\nhave carte blanche.  The appellate function, properly understood,\r                            \r\n\nrequires the reviewing  court to take a  hard look at the  record\r\n\nand  to reject  those  evidentiary interpretations  and illations\r\n\nthat  are unreasonable,  insupportable,  or  overly  speculative.\r\n\nSee,  e.g., United States  v. Valerio, 48  F.3d 58,  64 (1st Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1995);  United States  v. Loder,  23 F.3d  586, 589-92  (1st Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1994).  This function is especially  important in criminal cases,\r\n\ngiven the prosecution's  obligation to prove every element  of an\r\n\noffense beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\n          In this  instance, the jury convicted  the appellant on\r\n\ncount 2  as an aider and abettor.   See 18 U.S.C.    2(a).  Under\r                                                 \r\n\nthis theory of accomplice liability, Spinney would be guilty only\r\n\nif  the  government  proved   (1)  that  Kirvan  (the  principal)\r\n\ncommitted the  substantive offense (armed bank  robbery), and (2)\r\n\nthat Spinney (the accomplice) became associated with the endeavor\r\n\nand took part in it, intending to ensure its success.

Because the jury heard plethoric evidence  from\r\n\nwhich it  rationally could  conclude that Kirvan  committed armed\r\n\nbank robbery, we direct our  analysis to the second of these  two\r\n\nelements.\r\n\n          The  central requirement  of the  second element  is \"a\r\n\nshowing that  the defendant  consciously  shared the  principal's\r\n\nknowledge of the  underlying criminal act,  and intended to  help\r\n\nthe principal.\"   United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d  967, 975 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1995).  In a prosecution for armed bank robbery, this shared\r\n\nknowledge requirement is binary; it extends both to awareness  of\r\n\nthe  robbery and to comprehension  that a weapon  would likely be\r\n\nused.   See United States v.  Jones, 678 F.2d 102,  106 (9th Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1982)  (explaining   that,  to  convict  under      2113(d),  the\r\n\nprosecution must \"show that the  defendant aided and abetted  the\r\n\nprincipal  both in the act of bank robbery and in the principal's\r\n\nuse  of `a dangerous weapon  or device' during  the act\") (citing\r\n\nother  cases).    Appellant  maintains that  neither  finding  is\r\n\njustified here.   In the first place, he claims that the evidence\r\n\ndoes not adequately  show that he knew Kirvan aspired  to rob the\r\n\nBank  and  nonetheless endeavored  to help  him.   In  the second\r\n\nplace, he claims  that the record is devoid of  any proof that he\r                                                             \r\n\nknew about the actual or intended use of a gun.3\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3If  both arguments  succeed,  then the  conviction must  be\r\nreversed.     Conversely,  if  both  arguments   fail,  then  the\r\nconviction  must be  affirmed.   However, if  the first  argument\r\nfails, but the second succeeds, then,  since the jury necessarily\r\nfound  all  the elements  of unarmed  bank  robbery, 18  U.S.C.  \r                                              \r\n2113(a), and since the  trial court charged on that  statute as a\r\nlesser  included offense  under    2113(d), we  would  remand for\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\n          1.

Appellant does not assert\r\n\nthat he was  \"merely present\" at the scene.   See Ortiz, 966 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 711 (\"Mere association between the principal and those accused\r\n\nof aiding and abetting is not  sufficient to establish guilt; . .\r\n\n.  nor is mere  presence at the scene and knowledge that  a crime\r\n\nwas  to   be  committed   sufficient  to  establish   aiding  and\r\n\nabetting.\")  (internal  quotation  marks omitted).    Rather,  he\r\n\nfocuses on the lack of direct evidence placing him at  the switch\r\n\nsite, in or  near the Bank,  or in Kirvan's  company at any  time\r\n\nexcept immediately prior to the  commission of the crime, thereby\r\n\nattempting  to raise  doubts  about whether  he had  any specific\r\n\nintent to assist in the enterprise.\r\n\n          This  argument  is flawed  in  its  presumption that  a\r\n\ndearth of  direct evidence somehow precludes  jurors from drawing\r\n\nlogical  inferences based  on available  circumstantial evidence.\r\n\nContrary to  the burden  of appellant's thesis,  it is  precisely\r\n\nthose situations  that involve an  absence of direct  evidence in\r\n\nwhich circumstantial evidence must be most closely analyzed.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nO'Brien,  14  F.3d  at 706  (explaining  that  a  lack of  direct\r                 \r\n\nevidence spurs  examination of indirect  evidence).  In  the last\r\n\nanalysis,  the persuasive  power  of  circumstantial evidence  is\r\n\nattributable  more to its  relevance and probative  force than to\r\n\nthe presence of complementary direct evidence.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nresentencing on that basis.

See United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nOlbres,      F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1995) [No. 94-2123, slip op.\r                \r\n\nat   10]  (finding   a  \"sturdy   infrastructure,\"  provided   by\r\n\n\"circumstantial  and  suggestive\"   evidence,  for  making  sound\r\n\nrational inferences); Taylor, 57 F.3d at 975 (similar); see  also\r                                                                           \r\n\nOrtiz,  966  F.2d  at  711  (remarking  that  \"[t]he  sum  of  an\r               \r\n\nevidentiary  presentation may  be  greater than  its  constituent\r\n\nparts\") (quoting  Bourjaily,  483  U.S. at  180).    Since  every\r                                     \r\n\nnecessary inference is adequately rooted in the record, we reject\r\n\nas meritless  appellant's assignment of error based on a supposed\r\n\nlack of  proof that he knew  of, and helped to  further, Kirvan's\r\n\ndesire to rob the Bank.4\r\n\n          2.

Refined to bare essence, appellant's asseveration on\r\n\nthis  point is that the evidence, taken  as a whole, is so sparse\r\n\nthat it does not  satisfy the Sanborn standard; there  are simply\r                                               \r\n\nno  facts, he  tells  us, from  which  a reasonable  juror  could\r\n\nextrapolate to a finding of shared knowledge.5  We do not agree.\r\n\n          In  terms, the  Sanborn rubric  requires only  proof of\r                                           \r\n\n\"notice of . . . likelihood\"  to satisfy this prong of the shared\r\n\nknowledge  element  in connection  with  a charge  of  aiding and\r\n\nabetting  an  armed  bank robbery.    This  phrase  is not  self-\r\n\ndefining.  Hence, it is important to search out its meaning.\r\n\n          We  start from  the  premise that  the Sanborn  court's\r                                                                  \r\n\nformulation of the shared knowledge requirement is  not merely an\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Having  Moved for  the  dismissal of  the conspiracy  count\r\nagainst  appellant,  the  government  did  not try  to  hang  his\r\ncriminal  liability  on  the  reasonably  foreseeable  act  of  a\r\ncoconspirator.

See infra  Part III.  The glaring  linguistic difference\r                            \r\n\nbetween the two formulations guides our inquiry.\r\n\n          Knowledge is a concept,  not an absolute.  In  the law,\r\n\nas  in  life, \"knowledge\"  means  different  things in  different\r\n\ncontexts.    Accordingly, we  believe it  is  useful to  view the\r\n\nconcept as a continuum.\r\n\n          At  one end of the  continuum is what  the law commonly\r\n\ncalls \"constructive  knowledge.\"   Constructive knowledge  is the\r\n\nlaw's  way of  recognizing that,  given  an awareness  of certain\r\n\nsubsidiary  facts, a  person  is quite  likely  to know,  can  be\r\n\nexpected to  know, or at  least should  know that a  further fact\r\n\nexists.   See Black's Law Dictionary 314  (6th ed. 1990) (\"If one\r                       \r\n\nby exercise  of reasonable  care would have  known a fact,  he is\r\n\ndeemed to have had constructive knowledge of said fact . . . .\").\r\n\nBy way of illustration, if an easily visible foreign object is on\r\n\na  staircase for an appreciable  length of time,  the law accepts\r\n\nthe  reasonableness  of a  conclusion  that the  occupier  of the\r\n\npremises \"knew\" of its presence (even though there is no evidence\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nthat the occupier actually knew, by observation or report, of the\r                                    \r\n\nobject's whereabouts).\r\n\n          At  the  other end  of the  continuum  is what  the law\r\n\ncommonly calls \"actual knowledge.\"  Actual knowledge, as the term\r\n\nimplies, reduces the need for inference; it suggests the presence\r\n\nof   particular   evidence   which,  if   credited,   establishes\r\n\nconclusively that the person in question knew of the existence of\r\n\nthe fact in question.  See  id. at 873 (defining actual knowledge\r                                         \r\n\nas  \"positive, in contrast to imputed or inferred, knowledge of a\r\n\nfact\").   To carry our example forward, if witnesses testify that\r\n\nthe occupier himself placed  the foreign object on the  stair, or\r\n\nremarked its  location, that testimony,  if believed, establishes\r\n\nthat the occupier actually knew of its presence.\r\n\n          The concepts  of constructive  and actual knowledge  do\r\n\nnot occupy the entire span of the continuum.  Knowledge varies in\r\n\norigin, degree, and an array of other respects.  These gradations\r\n\nare best  visualized as way  stations that dot the  length of the\r\n\nhypothetical knowledge continuum.  Notice of likelihood fits into\r\n\nthe poorly charted area  that stretches between the poles  of the\r\n\ncontinuum.   While  we  believe that,  in  a criminal  case,  the\r\n\nreasonable  doubt  standard  requires that  notice  of likelihood\r\n\ncomprise   more  than  constructive  knowledge  simpliciter,  its\r                                                                     \r\n\narticulation evokes  echoes of constructive knowledge  and places\r\n\nthe  proof  requirement  closer to  that  end  of  the continuum.\r\n\nActual knowledge, after all,  is certain knowledge, see  id., and\r                                                                      \r\n\nlikelihood is not the stuff of certainty.\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\n          Logically,  then,  the  Sanborn rubric  implies,  in  a\r                                                   \r\n\nsection 2113(d) case, that  the defendant's shared knowledge need\r\n\nnot amount to actual knowledge that his cohort  intended to use a\r                              \r\n\ngun or  other  dangerous  weapon in  robbing  the  bank;  indeed,\r\n\nSanborn's disjunctive phraseology, 563  F.2d at 491 (\"knew .  . .\r                 \r\n\nor at  least . . .  was on notice of the  likelihood\"), leaves no\r\n\ndoubt  that a conviction can  be grounded on  something less than\r\n\nactual  knowledge.   We  conclude  that  an  enhanced showing  of\r\n\nconstructive  knowledge  will  suffice.   See  United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nGrubczak, 793 F.2d 458, 463 (2d Cir. 1986).\r                  \r\n\n          While  this is  a very  close case,  we think  that the\r\n\nevidence clears  the notice of  likelihood hurdle.   Our analysis\r\n\nbuilds  on  the human  condition.   Jurors  are \"not  expected to\r\n\nignore  what is perfectly  obvious,\" Echeverri, 982  F.2d at 679,\r                                                        \r\n\nbut,   rather,  \"to  take  full  advantage  of  their  collective\r\n\nexperience and common sense.\"  O'Brien, 14 F.3d at 708.   In this\r                                                \r\n\ncase, the  scheme called for a lone robber to enter a bank during\r\n\nbusiness hours with the intent  of looting it.  One  would expect\r\n\ntellers, guards, customers, and other persons unsympathetic to an\r\n\nunauthorized  withdrawal of funds to  be on the  premises.  Under\r\n\nthose circumstances,  not even  the most sanguine  criminal would\r\n\nexpect clear sailing without some menace in  the wind.  In short,\r\n\nthe circumstances gave rise  to constructive knowledge beforehand\r\n\nthat the intruder would need a gun or some other dangerous device\r\n\nto  accomplish the  felons' agreed  goal.

A jury\r\n\ncould  reasonably  infer  from  the  totality  of  the  attendant\r\n\ncircumstances,  particularly  from the  host  of telephone  calls\r\n\nbetween Spinney  and Kirvan  and from Spinney's  participation in\r\n\nthe elaborate reconnaissance mission, that he had a major role in\r\n\nplanning the heist.   Even  assuming that there  was no  specific\r\n\ndiscussion  of  the  use of  a  gun,  evidence  of a  defendant's\r\n\nsubstantial  involvement  over  the  course of  several  days  in\r\n\nplanning and  orchestrating a  robbery, when coupled  with actual\r\n\nparticipation in carrying it  out, permits a compelling inference\r\n\nthat  the defendant knew the  salient details of  the plot (e.g.,\r\n\nthe  timing of the robbery, the bank's identity and location, the\r\n\nplanned entry by a lone robber).   These circumstances seem to us\r\n\nto  sustain  a finding  that Spinney  was  on notice  that Kirvan\r\n\nlikely would  tote a gun in  the course of  the upcoming robbery.\r\n\nSee  Grubczak,  793  F.2d  at  464  (relying  on  evidence  of  a\r                       \r\n\ndefendant's  substantial  involvement  as  a  planner  of  and  a\r\n\n\"principal player[] in the robbery\" to help ground \"the inference\r\n\nthat he had to have been aware of the likely use of a  gun\"); see\r                                                                           \r\n\nalso United States v.

In one\r\n\nsense,  at least, this may be so   but \"[t]he rule is not that an\r\n\ninference,  no matter how reasonable, is to be rejected if it, in\r\n\nturn,  depends upon  another  reasonable inference;  rather,  the\r\n\nquestion  is  merely   whether  the  total   evidence,  including\r\n\nreasonable inferences, when put together is sufficient to warrant\r\n\na jury to conclude  that defendant is guilty beyond  a reasonable\r\n\ndoubt.\"  Dirring v.

Chains of inference  are a\r                      \r\n\nfamiliar,  widely   accepted   ingredient  of   any  process   of\r\n\nratiocination.  This method  of reasoning, commonly called logic,\r\n\nis  regularly relied  upon in  the realm  of human  endeavor, and\r\n\nshould not be forbidden to a criminal jury.\r\n\n          Of course,  the inferential chain must be strong6   but\r\n\nhere,  the  hypothesis  upon   which  Spinney's  section  2113(d)\r\n\nconviction rests is not at all dubious.  On  this record, despite\r\n\nthe lack of direct evidence and the uncertainties associated with\r\n\nthat lack, the jury rationally could find Spinney to have been an\r\n\narchitect of, and an  active participant in, the robbery.

See  Dinkane,  17  F.3d  at  1197;  United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\nPendergraph, 791  F.2d 1462, 1466 (11th Cir. 1986), cert. denied,\r                                                                          \r\n479  U.S. 869 (1986).   But every  case is different  and must be\r\njudged on its particular array of facts.  Moreover, in this case,\r\nunlike in Dinkane, 17  F.3d at 1195, the district  court properly\r                           \r\ninstructed  the jury as to  the elements of  aiding and abetting,\r\nand unlike in Pendergraph, 791 F.2d at 1464-65, the court did not\r                                   \r\nerroneously  admit  evidence that  would  have  allowed the  jury\r\nimproperly to convict.   At any rate,  to the extent our  holding\r\ntoday  contradicts  Dinkane  and/or  Pendergraph,  we  stand  our\r                                                          \r\nground.   In the final  analysis, we cannot  reject as irrational\r\nthe jury's \"conclu[sion] that an accomplice so closely associated\r\nwith the venture could not fail to know what would be the central\r\nquestion in  any robbery:    how the  robbers were  to force  the\r\nbank's employees to part  with the money.\"  Sanborn,  563 F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n490.\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nU.S.C.    2113(d)  and 924(c), respectively,  at the less  taxing\r\n\nend of the knowledge  continuum.  We are uncomfortable  with this\r\n\nesemplastic approach.  Particularly when  juxtaposed with \"notice\r\n\nof  . . . likelihood,\" we believe that \"practical certainty\" is a\r\n\nrubric that  calls  for proof  verging on  actual knowledge,  see\r                                                                           \r\n\nModel Penal  Code   2.02  at 236  n.13 (1985)  (\"With respect  to\r\n\nresult elements, one  cannot of course  `know' infallibly that  a\r\n\ncertain  result will follow from engaging in conduct, and thus to\r\n\nsome  extent  `knowledge,'  when   applied  to  result  elements,\r\n\nincludes  a  contingency  factor  as  well.    This  is expressed\r\n\ndefinitionally  in terms  of  whether the  actor is  `practically\r\n\ncertain' that  the result will  follow.\"), and, thus,  presents a\r\n\nconsiderably higher hurdle  for the prosecution to overcome.  Nor\r\n\ndo  we think that  we are free  to cut  this hurdle down  to size\r\n\neither  by  reading  significantly  dissimilar  articulations  to\r\n\ndenote  a  single  meaning  or  by treating  one  of  them  as  a\r\n\nlinguistic  accident.  Courts invite error when they try to weigh\r\n\nmeaning only after placing a thumb on the scale, or when they too\r\n\nfreely write  off as  malapropos  words carefully  chosen in  the\r\n\npast.   If principle  is to prevail,  we must give  effect to the\r\n\nobvious difference in standards of knowledge.8\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8There are,  moreover, policy reasons why  courts might wish\r\nto adopt divergent standards  for an accomplice's knowledge under\r\nthe  two statutes. While possession  of a gun  or other dangerous\r\ninstrumentality will  likely facilitate  a bank robbery,  many of\r\nthe felonies  that underlie    924(c) can  be   and  often are   \r\ncompleted   unarmed.     Furthermore,  defendants   convicted  of\r\nviolating    924(c), unlike  defendants convicted of  violating  \r\n2113(d),  must be given an  additional sentence of  at least five\r                                                \r\nyears, to run  consecutively to the term of incarceration imposed\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\n          In  this  case, the  difference  is  dispositive.   The\r\n\ngovernment's argument  boils down to  an assertion that  the jury\r\n\ncould  infer that  Spinney  was practically  certain of  Kirvan's\r\n\nanticipated use  of a  gun based  on  the evidence  we have  just\r\n\nreviewed,  principally  the  confederates'  joint  design  of the\r\n\nrobbery.  Yet, the government adduced no evidence suggesting that\r\n\nfirearms were  actually contemplated  in the planning  stages, or\r\n\nthat Spinney had any actual knowledge that Kirvan would be armed.\r\n\nUnder the  circumstances, we conclude that  the government's best\r\n\nevidence (that  Spinney helped to mastermind  the robbery), taken\r\n\nin the light  most favorable  to the verdict,  even when  coupled\r\n\nwith  the   jury's  ability  to  make   intuitive  judgments,  is\r\n\ninsufficient  to  support the  requisite  inference of  practical\r\n\ncertainty.9   See, e.g., Powell,  929 F.2d at  729; United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

Medina, 32 F.3d 40, 47 (2d Cir. 1994)\r                                            \r\n(narrowly directing its holding to cases brought  under   924(c),\r\nand distinguishing  cases brought under    2113(d)), our research\r\nhas  revealed no  reported case  in which  the evidence  has been\r\nfound sufficient to sustain an aiding and abetting conviction for\r\narmed  bank  robbery, but  insufficient  to sustain  a  charge of\r\naiding and abetting the commission of a firearms offense based on\r\nthe same incident.  To that extent, our decision today breaks new\r\nground.\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nknowledge of a vessel's cargo was imputed to crew members.

But these scenarios are readily distinguishable from\r\n\nthe  case at bar.  In  those cases, guilty knowledge was inferred\r\n\nfrom the  crew members' close proximity  to detectable quantities\r\n\nof  drugs over  an  extended period  of  time.10   See  Guerrero-\r                                                                           \r\n\nGuerrero, 776 F.2d at 1074-75;  Quejada-Zurique, 708 F.2d at 859-\r                                                         \r\n\n60.  Here,  Spinney did not even enter the bank, and there was no\r\n\nevidence  that Kirvan had the  weapon in his  possession while he\r\n\nand Spinney were together  before the robbery, let alone  that it\r\n\nwas visible  or  otherwise  detectable at  that  juncture.    Put\r\n\nbluntly, even though Spinney may have spent much time with Kirvan\r\n\ndevising the plan, and was on notice of the likelihood that a gun\r\n\nwould be  used in the course  of the robbery, there  is simply no\r\n\nevidence  to  support  a  reasoned conclusion  that  Spinney  was\r\n\npractically certain that Kirvan would be armed.\r\n\n          In sum, \"likelihood\" and \"practical certainty\" are  not\r\n\nequivalent terms.

CONCLUSION\r          IV.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          This is  the rare  case in  which the evidence,  viewed\r\n\nmost  congenially  to the  government,  passes  muster under  the\r\n\nnotice   of  likelihood   test  and,  therefore,   justifies  the\r\n\nappellant's  conviction for  aiding  and abetting  an armed  bank\r\n\nrobbery,  18  U.S.C.     2113(d), but,  nevertheless,  fails  the\r\n\npractical  certainty test  and, therefore,  does not  justify the\r\n\nappellant's conviction for  aiding and  abetting the  principal's\r\n\nuse of a firearm during  and in relation to a crime  of violence,\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   924(c).  This  result, though it is unusual, does not\r\n\nstrike us as strange.  See, e.g., Model Penal Code   2.02 at 236-\r                                          \r\n\n37  n.13 (suggesting  that, where  knowledge is  in issue,  it is\r\n\nsometimes \"meaningful to draw  a line between practical certainty\r\n\nand awareness  of substantial  risk\").   So it  is here:   though\r\n\nnotice  of likelihood must  be proven beyond  a reasonable doubt,\r\n\nthe government  can meet  this burden  by an  evidentiary showing\r\n\nless  than is  required to  prove that  the defendant  knew to  a\r\n\npractical certainty that a gun would be used.\r\n\n          We   need  go  no  further.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We limn the pertinent facts in the light most favorable to the government, see United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 710-11 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1005, 122 L.Ed.2d 154 (1993), paying particular heed to those details that arguably reflect what appellant knew and when he knew it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 20, 1991, at around 3:00 p.m., Gerald Mohan, a conscientious FBI agent, noticed appellant (a person previously known to him) sitting on the steps of the Federal Building in Lowell, Massachusetts.  Mohan decided to mount an impromptu surveillance.  As he was positioning his vehicle, a blue Oldsmobile arrived at the scene.  After appellant entered the Oldsmobile, it made several quick turns and then pulled to the curb.  The driver (subsequently identified as Paul Kirvan) moved into the front passenger seat and appellant took the wheel.  Kirvan and appellant proceeded to criss-cross the streets around the Lowell Institution for Savings (the Bank).  Mohan testified that the pair's driving pattern appeared to be part of a process of careful scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roughly fifteen minutes after beginning surveillance, Mohan followed the Oldsmobile to Academy Drive.  There he observed a classic getaway \"switch site\" on a dead end approximately 0.3 miles from the Bank.  Appellant and Kirvan next returned to the vicinity of the Federal Building.  On Fayette Street, Kirvan alighted from the Oldsmobile (which he owned), entered a parked Chevrolet Monte Carlo (later ascertained to have been stolen some distance away), and began driving toward the Bank.  Appellant followed him in the Oldsmobile, and Mohan followed both of them, caravan-style, in his own vehicle.  When the two drivers veered in separate directions, Mohan lost sight of both cars.  He circled in the general vicinity and, some four minutes later, glimpsed the Chevrolet at a standstill in the Bank's parking lot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mohan made a U-turn and headed back to the Bank.  His efforts were unavailing;  at that precise moment, the Chevrolet accelerated rapidly out of the parking lot and passed him (going in the opposite direction).  Kirvan was alone in the car.  Mohan made yet another U-turn and unsuccessfully gave chase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 3:25 p.m., ostensibly during the brief interval in which Mohan lost track of his quarry, a masked Kirvan entered the Bank, instructed those present not to move, jumped over the tellers' counter, stuffed the contents of several cash drawers into a garbage bag, leapt back over the counter, and fled.  Although Kirvan brandished a handgun at the height of the robbery, a teller testified that the weapon was not visible when he entered the Bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other percipient witnesses reported that, mid-afternoon of the same day, they saw a Chevrolet Monte Carlo speed down Academy Drive.  Two men, one holding a bag, emerged from the vehicle, crossed through two gates, and drove away in a waiting blue car.  The witnesses were unable to identify either suspect positively, although one of the men \"looked like\" appellant.  The Lowell police recovered the Chevrolet that afternoon.  They found Kirvan's blue Oldsmobile the next morning, abandoned not far from the switch site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government established that appellant and Kirvan had been close friends for many years.  Telephone toll records reflected seventy-three calls between the men's residences in the nineteen days preceding the robbery, including eleven calls on August 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury indicted appellant on counts of conspiracy to commit bank robbery, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371 (which count was later dismissed), aiding and abetting an armed bank robbery, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2113(d), and aiding and abetting the use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c).  A jury trial eventuated.  After appellant unsuccessfully moved for judgment of acquittal, the jurors returned a guilty verdict on each remaining count.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The court sentenced appellant to serve 262 months in prison for armed robbery and imposed a mandatory sixty-month consecutive sentence in respect to the firearms charge.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ARMED BANK ROBBERY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction on count 2.  Our task is straightforward.  We must ascertain whether, \"after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government, and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.\"  United States v. O'Brien, 14 F.3d 703, 706 (1st Cir.1994).  In performing this task, we do not pass upon the credibility of witnesses, see id., nor do we demand that the government disprove every hypothesis consistent with the defendant's innocence, see United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury reached its verdict in this case on the basis of circumstantial evidence.  Reliance on indirect, as opposed to direct, evidence in a criminal case is both permissible and commonplace.  See O'Brien, 14 F.3d at 706 (observing that \"the criminal law does not place a special premium on direct evidence\").  In making such judgments, \"juries are not required to examine the evidence in isolation, for 'individual pieces of evidence, insufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in cumulation prove it.' \"  Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 711 (quoting Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 179-80, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 2780-81, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987)).  Thus, when a jury draws inferences from circumstantial evidence, a reviewing court should refrain from second-guessing the ensuing conclusions as long as (1) the inferences derive support from a plausible rendition of the record, and (2) the conclusions flow rationally from those inferences.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a cautionary note.  Despite the deference that characterizes appellate review of jury verdicts, juries do not have carte blanche.   The appellate function, properly understood, requires the reviewing court to take a hard look at the record and to reject those evidentiary interpretations and illations that are unreasonable, insupportable, or overly speculative.  See, e.g., United States v. Valerio, 48 F.3d 58, 64 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Loder, 23 F.3d 586, 589-92 (1st Cir.1994).  This function is especially important in criminal cases, given the prosecution's obligation to prove every element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the jury convicted the appellant on count 2 as an aider and abettor.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2(a).  Under this theory of accomplice liability, Spinney would be guilty only if the government proved (1) that Kirvan (the principal) committed the substantive offense (armed bank robbery), and (2) that Spinney (the accomplice) became associated with the endeavor and took part in it, intending to ensure its success.  See Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States, 336 U.S. 613, 619, 69 S.Ct. 766, 769-70, 93 L.Ed. 919 (1949);  Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 711 n. 1.   Because the jury heard plethoric evidence from which it rationally could conclude that Kirvan committed armed bank robbery, we direct our analysis to the second of these two elements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The central requirement of the second element is \"a showing that the defendant consciously shared the principal's knowledge of the underlying criminal act, and intended to help the principal.\"  United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 975 (1st Cir.1995).  In a prosecution for armed bank robbery, this shared knowledge requirement is binary;  it extends both to awareness of the robbery and to comprehension that a weapon would likely be used.  See United States v. Jones, 678 F.2d 102, 106 (9th Cir.1982) (explaining that, to convict under Sec. 2113(d), the prosecution must \"show that the defendant aided and abetted the principal both in the act of bank robbery and in the principal's use of 'a dangerous weapon or device' during the act\") (citing other cases).  Appellant maintains that neither finding is justified here.  In the first place, he claims that the evidence does not adequately show that he knew Kirvan aspired to rob the Bank and nonetheless endeavored to help him.  In the second place, he claims that the record is devoid of any proof that he knew about the actual or intended use of a gun.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Shared Knowledge of the Robbery.   The first challenge need not occupy us for long.  Appellant does not assert that he was \"merely present\" at the scene.  See Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 711 (\"Mere association between the principal and those accused of aiding and abetting is not sufficient to establish guilt;  ...  nor is mere presence at the scene and knowledge that a crime was to be committed sufficient to establish aiding and abetting.\")  (internal quotation marks omitted).  Rather, he focuses on the lack of direct evidence placing him at the switch site, in or near the Bank, or in Kirvan's company at any time except immediately prior to the commission of the crime, thereby attempting to raise doubts about whether he had any specific intent to assist in the enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is flawed in its presumption that a dearth of direct evidence somehow precludes jurors from drawing logical inferences based on available circumstantial evidence.  Contrary to the burden of appellant's thesis, it is precisely those situations that involve an absence of direct evidence in which circumstantial evidence must be most closely analyzed.  See O'Brien, 14 F.3d at 706 (explaining that a lack of direct evidence spurs examination of indirect evidence).  In the last analysis, the persuasive power of circumstantial evidence is attributable more to its relevance and probative force than to the presence of complementary direct evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having in mind Mohan's observations, the events that transpired on Academy Drive, the vehicles abandoned in close proximity to the Bank, and the telephone logs, a completely rational juror need make only modest inferential leaps to arrive at a founded conclusion that the two long-time friends planned the crime, the flight, and the car switch.  See United States v. Olbres, 61 F.3d 967, 971-72 (1st Cir.1995) (finding a \"sturdy infrastructure,\" provided by \"circumstantial and suggestive\" evidence, for making sound rational inferences);  Taylor, 54 F.3d at 975 (similar);  see also Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 711 (remarking that \"[t]he sum of an evidentiary presentation may be greater than its constituent parts\") (quoting Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 180, 107 S.Ct. at 2781).   Since every necessary inference is adequately rooted in the record, we reject as meritless appellant's assignment of error based on a supposed lack of proof that he knew of, and helped to further, Kirvan's desire to rob the Bank.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Shared Knowledge of the Weapon.   Appellant's stronger challenge is directed at the jury's finding of shared knowledge, prior to the commission of the crime, that Kirvan would use a firearm.  See United States v. Dinkane, 17 F.3d 1192, 1197 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that, for purposes of Sec. 2113(d), aiding and abetting requires prior knowledge of weapon);  see generally United States v. de la Cruz-Paulino, 61 F.3d 986, 999-1000 (1st Cir.1995) (stating, in aiding and abetting case, that shared knowledge must be prior knowledge).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A participant in the holdup of a bank will be found to be an aider and abettor of an armed robbery only if the government can provide an additional piece of the puzzle:  proof that the accomplice \"knew a dangerous weapon would be used [in the robbery] or at least ... was on notice of the likelihood of its use,\" United States v. Sanborn, 563 F.2d 488, 491 (1st Cir.1977);  accord United States v. Ferreira, 625 F.2d 1030, 1032 (1st Cir.1980).  Refined to bare essence, appellant's asseveration on this point is that the evidence, taken as a whole, is so sparse that it does not satisfy the Sanborn standard;  there are simply no facts, he tells us, from which a reasonable juror could extrapolate to a finding of shared knowledge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In terms, the Sanborn rubric requires only proof of \"notice of ... likelihood\" to satisfy this prong of the shared knowledge element in connection with a charge of aiding and abetting an armed bank robbery.  This phrase is not self-defining.  Hence, it is important to search out its meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start from the premise that the Sanborn court's formulation of the shared knowledge requirement is not merely an awkward locution.  Other courts have adopted it, see, e.g., United States v. McCaskill, 676 F.2d 995, 998 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1018, 103 S.Ct. 381, 74 L.Ed.2d 513 (1982);  Ingram v. United States, 592 A.2d 992, 1003 (D.C.App.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1017, 112 S.Ct. 667, 116 L.Ed.2d 757 (1991), and it stands in marked contrast--almost as point and counterpoint--to the \"practical certainty\" formulation that courts have developed for assessing the shared knowledge requirement applicable to aiding and abetting firearms charges brought under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c).  See infra Part III.  The glaring linguistic difference between the two formulations guides our inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knowledge is a concept, not an absolute.  In the law, as in life, \"knowledge\" means different things in different contexts.  Accordingly, we believe it is useful to view the concept as a continuum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At one end of the continuum is what the law commonly calls \"constructive knowledge.\"   Constructive knowledge is the law's way of recognizing that, given an awareness of certain subsidiary facts, a person is quite likely to know, can be expected to know, or at least should know that a further fact exists.  See Black's Law Dictionary 314 (6th ed. 1990) (\"If one by exercise of reasonable care would have known a fact, he is deemed to have had constructive knowledge of said fact....\").  By way of illustration, if an easily visible foreign object is on a staircase for an appreciable length of time, the law accepts the reasonableness of a conclusion that the occupier of the premises \"knew\" of its presence (even though there is no evidence that the occupier actually knew, by observation or report, of the object's whereabouts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the other end of the continuum is what the law commonly calls \"actual knowledge.\"   Actual knowledge, as the term implies, reduces the need for inference;  it suggests the presence of particular evidence which, if credited, establishes conclusively that the person in question knew of the existence of the fact in question.  See id. at 873 (defining actual knowledge as \"positive, in contrast to imputed or inferred, knowledge of a fact\").  To carry our example forward, if witnesses testify that the occupier himself placed the foreign object on the stair, or remarked its location, that testimony, if believed, establishes that the occupier actually knew of its presence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The concepts of constructive and actual knowledge do not occupy the entire span of the continuum.  Knowledge varies in origin, degree, and an array of other respects.  These gradations are best visualized as way stations that dot the length of the hypothetical knowledge continuum.  Notice of likelihood fits into the poorly charted area that stretches between the poles of the continuum.  While we believe that, in a criminal case, the reasonable doubt standard requires that notice of likelihood comprise more than constructive knowledge simpliciter, its articulation evokes echoes of constructive knowledge and places the proof requirement closer to that end of the continuum.  Actual knowledge, after all, is certain knowledge, see id., and likelihood is not the stuff of certainty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Logically, then, the Sanborn rubric implies, in a section 2113(d) case, that the defendant's shared knowledge need not amount to actual knowledge that his cohort intended to use a gun or other dangerous weapon in robbing the bank;  indeed, Sanborn 's disjunctive phraseology, 563 F.2d at 491 (\"knew ... or at least ... was on notice of the likelihood\"), leaves no doubt that a conviction can be grounded on something less than actual knowledge.  We conclude that an enhanced showing of constructive knowledge will suffice.  See United States v. Grubczak, 793 F.2d 458, 463 (2d Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this is a very close case, we think that the evidence clears the notice of likelihood hurdle.  Our analysis builds on the human condition.  Jurors are \"not expected to ignore what is perfectly obvious,\" Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 679, but, rather, \"to take full advantage of their collective experience and common sense.\"  O'Brien, 14 F.3d at 708.   In this case, the scheme called for a lone robber to enter a bank during business hours with the intent of looting it.  One would expect tellers, guards, customers, and other persons unsympathetic to an unauthorized withdrawal of funds to be on the premises.  Under those circumstances, not even the most sanguine criminal would expect clear sailing without some menace in the wind.  In short, the circumstances gave rise to constructive knowledge beforehand that the intruder would need a gun or some other dangerous device to accomplish the felons' agreed goal.  See United States v. Powell, 929 F.2d 724, 727 (D.C.Cir.1991) (stating, in dictum, that \"possession of a gun ... is virtually essential in [perpetrating a bank robbery]\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, moreover, Spinney was not merely a bit player (say, a lookout or a getaway driver), but a leading man.  A jury could reasonably infer from the totality of the attendant circumstances, particularly from the host of telephone calls between Spinney and Kirvan and from Spinney's participation in the elaborate reconnaissance mission, that he had a major role in planning the heist.  Even assuming that there was no specific discussion of the use of a gun, evidence of a defendant's substantial involvement over the course of several days in planning and orchestrating a robbery, when coupled with actual participation in carrying it out, permits a compelling inference that the defendant knew the salient details of the plot (e.g., the timing of the robbery, the bank's identity and location, the planned entry by a lone robber).  These circumstances seem to us to sustain a finding that Spinney was on notice that Kirvan likely would tote a gun in the course of the upcoming robbery.  See Grubczak, 793 F.2d at 464 (relying on evidence of a defendant's substantial involvement as a planner of and a \"principal player[ ] in the robbery\" to help ground \"the inference that he had to have been aware of the likely use of a gun\");  see also United States v. DeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1316 (1st Cir.1994) (inferring knowledge that weapons would be employed from accomplice's awareness of the conspirators' overall plan), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 947, 130 L.Ed.2d 890 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant decries this approach, claiming that it necessitates the stacking of inference upon inference.  In one sense, at least, this may be so--but \"[t]he rule is not that an inference, no matter how reasonable, is to be rejected if it, in turn, depends upon another reasonable inference;  rather, the question is merely whether the total evidence, including reasonable inferences, when put together is sufficient to warrant a jury to conclude that defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Dirring v. United States, 328 F.2d 512, 515 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 1003, 84 S.Ct. 1939, 12 L.Ed.2d 1052 (1964).  Chains of inference are a familiar, widely accepted ingredient of any process of ratiocination.  This method of reasoning, commonly called logic, is regularly relied upon in the realm of human endeavor, and should not be forbidden to a criminal jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the inferential chain must be strong<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>--but here, the hypothesis upon which Spinney's section 2113(d) conviction rests is not at all dubious.  On this record, despite the lack of direct evidence and the uncertainties associated with that lack, the jury rationally could find Spinney to have been an architect of, and an active participant in, the robbery.  Given these available findings, and the persuasive force of the other permissible inferences supported by the overall circumstances, we cannot say that the jury exceeded its proper province in concluding that Spinney was on notice of the likelihood that Kirvan would use a gun.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  See Sanborn, 563 F.2d at 490.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE FIREARMS CHARGE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence in regard to his conviction under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c).  Although here, too, appellant is charged as an aider and abettor, his assignment of error raises a somewhat different question.  To prove that a defendant aided and abetted a violation of section 924(c), the government must establish that the defendant knew \"to a practical certainty that the principal would be [using] a gun.\"  United States v. Torres-Maldonado, 14 F.3d 95, 103 (1st Cir.)  (quoting Powell, 929 F.2d at 728), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 193, 130 L.Ed.2d 125 (1994);  accord DeMasi, 40 F.3d at 1316.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government strives to collapse the linguistically different standards for aiding and abetting liability under 18 U.S.C. Secs. 2113(d) and 924(c), respectively, at the less taxing end of the knowledge continuum.  We are uncomfortable with this esemplastic approach.  Particularly when juxtaposed with \"notice of ... likelihood,\" we believe that \"practical certainty\" is a rubric that calls for proof verging on actual knowledge, see Model Penal Code Sec. 2.02 at 236 n. 13 (1985) (\"With respect to result elements, one cannot of course 'know' infallibly that a certain result will follow from engaging in conduct, and thus to some extent 'knowledge,' when applied to result elements, includes a contingency factor as well.  This is expressed definitionally in terms of whether the actor is 'practically certain' that the result will follow.\"), and, thus, presents a considerably higher hurdle for the prosecution to overcome.  Nor do we think that we are free to cut this hurdle down to size either by reading significantly dissimilar articulations to denote a single meaning or by treating one of them as a linguistic accident.  Courts invite error when they try to weigh meaning only after placing a thumb on the scale, or when they too freely write off as malapropos words carefully chosen in the past.  If principle is to prevail, we must give effect to the obvious difference in standards of knowledge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the difference is dispositive.  The government's argument boils down to an assertion that the jury could infer that Spinney was practically certain of Kirvan's anticipated use of a gun based on the evidence we have just reviewed, principally the confederates' joint design of the robbery.  Yet, the government adduced no evidence suggesting that firearms were actually contemplated in the planning stages, or that Spinney had any actual knowledge that Kirvan would be armed.  Under the circumstances, we conclude that the government's best evidence (that Spinney helped to mastermind the robbery), taken in the light most favorable to the verdict, even when coupled with the jury's ability to make intuitive judgments, is insufficient to support the requisite inference of practical certainty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  See, e.g., Powell, 929 F.2d at 729;  United States v. Hamblin, 911 F.2d 551, 558-59 (11th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 943, 111 S.Ct. 2241, 114 L.Ed.2d 482 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch effort to save the day, the government directs our attention to a series of drug cases in which knowledge of a vessel's cargo was imputed to crew members.  See, e.g., United States v. Guerrero-Guerrero, 776 F.2d 1071 (1st Cir.1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1029, 106 S.Ct. 1233, 89 L.Ed.2d 342 (1986);  United States v. Quejada-Zurique, 708 F.2d 857 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 855, 104 S.Ct. 173, 78 L.Ed.2d 156 (1983).  But these scenarios are readily distinguishable from the case at bar.  In those cases, guilty knowledge was inferred from the crew members' close proximity to detectable quantities of drugs over an extended period of time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See Guerrero-Guerrero, 776 F.2d at 1074-75;  Quejada-Zurique, 708 F.2d at 859-60.   Here, Spinney did not even enter the bank, and there was no evidence that Kirvan had the weapon in his possession while he and Spinney were together before the robbery, let alone that it was visible or otherwise detectable at that juncture.  Put bluntly, even though Spinney may have spent much time with Kirvan devising the plan, and was on notice of the likelihood that a gun would be used in the course of the robbery, there is simply no evidence to support a reasoned conclusion that Spinney was practically certain that Kirvan would be armed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, \"likelihood\" and \"practical certainty\" are not equivalent terms.  Applying the practical certainty rubric, we hold that the jury reached its verdict on the section 924(c) count without an adequate evidentiary foundation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is the rare case in which the evidence, viewed most congenially to the government, passes muster under the notice of likelihood test and, therefore, justifies the appellant's conviction for aiding and abetting an armed bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2113(d), but, nevertheless, fails the practical certainty test and, therefore, does not justify the appellant's conviction for aiding and abetting the principal's use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c).  This result, though it is unusual, does not strike us as strange.  See, e.g., Model Penal Code Sec. 2.02 at 236-37 n. 13 (suggesting that, where knowledge is in issue, it is sometimes \"meaningful to draw a line between practical certainty and awareness of substantial risk\").  So it is here:  though notice of likelihood must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the government can meet this burden by an evidentiary showing less than is required to prove that the defendant knew to a practical certainty that a gun would be used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  The law is full of complexities, and language is, at best, an imperfect device for capturing the energy of ideas.  Here, interpreting the words used by the Sanborn court (\"notice of ... likelihood\"), on the one hand, and by the Powell court (\"practical certainty\"), on the other hand, \"in the light of the tacit assumptions upon which it is reasonable to suppose that the language was used,\" Ohio v. Agler, 280 U.S. 379, 383, 50 S.Ct. 154, 155, 74 L.Ed. 489 (1930) (Holmes, J.), it is unsurprising to discover a fork in the road.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's conviction on count 2 is affirmed and the appellant's conviction on count 3 is reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Count 1, which charged appellant with conspiring to commit bank robbery, see 18 U.S.C.

The implicated portions of the applicable statutes are as follows:</p>\n        <p>Whoever, by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes, or attempts to take, from the person or presence of another ... any property or money or any other thing of value belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management, or possession of, any [federally insured] bank ...

Notwithstanding the verdict, the judge ordered an acquittal on the latter count.  We affirmed the armed bank robbery conviction and reinstated the firearms conviction.  See United States v.

Sec. 2113(a), and since the trial court charged on that statute as a lesser included offense under Sec. 2113(d), we would remand for resentencing on that basis.  See, e.g., United States v.

Compare Pinkerton v.

But a conjecture consistent with the evidence becomes less and less a conjecture, and moves gradually toward proof, as alternative innocent explanations are discarded or made less likely.\"  Stewart v. Coalter, 48 F.3d 610, 615-16 (1st Cir.1995), petition for cert. filed (U.S. June 19, 1995) (No. 94-9742)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We acknowledge that two other courts, on somewhat analogous facts, have found that a defendant's participation in planning will not support a conviction for aiding and abetting under Sec. 2113(d).  See Dinkane, 17 F.3d at 1197;  United States v. Pendegraph, 791 F.2d 1462, 1466 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 869, 107 S.Ct. 235, 93 L.Ed.2d 160 (1986).  But every case is different and must be judged on its particular array of facts.  Moreover, in this case, unlike in Dinkane, 17 F.3d at 1195, the district court properly instructed the jury as to the elements of aiding and abetting, and unlike in Pendegraph, 791 F.2d at 1464-65, the court did not erroneously admit evidence that would have allowed the jury improperly to convict.  At any rate, to the extent our holding today contradicts Dinkane and/or Pendegraph, we stand our ground.  In the final analysis, we cannot reject as irrational the jury's \"conclu[sion] that an accomplice so closely associated with the venture could not fail to know what would be the central question in any robbery:  how the robbers were to force the bank's employees to part with the money.\"  Sanborn, 563 F.2d at 490</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> There are, moreover, policy reasons why courts might wish to adopt divergent standards for an accomplice's knowledge under the two statutes.  While possession of a gun or other dangerous instrumentality will likely facilitate a bank robbery, many of the felonies that underlie Sec. 924(c) can be--and often are--completed unarmed.  Furthermore, defendants convicted of violating Sec. 924(c), unlike defendants convicted of violating Sec. 2113(d), must be given an additional sentence of at least five years, to run consecutively to the term of incarceration imposed for the underlying crime.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1).  Both of these considerations suggest that a higher threshold of knowledge may well be appropriate in the Sec. 924(c) milieu</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Although courts sometimes have distinguished between prosecutions under the two statutes with which we are concerned, see, e.g., United States v. Medina, 32 F.3d 40, 47 (2d Cir.1994) (narrowly directing its holding to cases brought under Sec. 924(c), and distinguishing cases brought under Sec. 2113(d)), our research has revealed no reported case in which the evidence has been found sufficient to sustain an aiding and abetting conviction for armed bank robbery, but insufficient to sustain a charge of aiding and abetting the commission of a firearms offense based on the same incident.  To that extent, our decision today breaks new ground</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> These situations involve what we have termed \"culpable presence.\"  Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 712.

Mohan decided to mount an impromptu surveillance.  As he was positioning his vehicle, a blue Oldsmobile arrived at the scene.  After appellant entered the Oldsmobile, it made several quick turns and then pulled to the curb.  The driver (subsequently identified as Paul Kirvan) moved into the front passenger seat and appellant took the wheel.  Kirvan and appellant proceeded to criss-cross the streets around the Lowell Institution for Savings (the Bank).  Mohan testified that the pair's driving pattern appeared to be part of a process of careful scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roughly fifteen minutes after beginning surveillance, Mohan followed the Oldsmobile to Academy Drive.  There he observed a classic getaway \"switch site\" on a dead end approximately 0.3 miles from the Bank.  Appellant and Kirvan next returned to the vicinity of the Federal Building.  On Fayette Street, Kirvan alighted from the Oldsmobile (which he owned), entered a parked Chevrolet Monte Carlo (later ascertained to have been stolen some distance away), and began driving toward the Bank.  Appellant followed him in the Oldsmobile, and Mohan followed both of them, caravan-style, in his own vehicle.  When the two drivers veered in separate directions, Mohan lost sight of both cars.  He circled in the general vicinity and, some four minutes later, glimpsed the Chevrolet at a standstill in the Bank's parking lot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mohan made a U-turn and headed back to the Bank.  His efforts were unavailing;  at that precise moment, the Chevrolet accelerated rapidly out of the parking lot and passed him (going in the opposite direction).  Kirvan was alone in the car.  Mohan made yet another U-turn and unsuccessfully gave chase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 3:25 p.m., ostensibly during the brief interval in which Mohan lost track of his quarry, a masked Kirvan entered the Bank, instructed those present not to move, jumped over the tellers' counter, stuffed the contents of several cash drawers into a garbage bag, leapt back over the counter, and fled.  Although Kirvan brandished a handgun at the height of the robbery, a teller testified that the weapon was not visible when he entered the Bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other percipient witnesses reported that, mid-afternoon of the same day, they saw a Chevrolet Monte Carlo speed down Academy Drive.  Two men, one holding a bag, emerged from the vehicle, crossed through two gates, and drove away in a waiting blue car.  The witnesses were unable to identify either suspect positively, although one of the men \"looked like\" appellant.  The Lowell police recovered the Chevrolet that afternoon.

Despite the deference that characterizes appellate review of jury verdicts, juries do not have carte blanche.   The appellate function, properly understood, requires the reviewing court to take a hard look at the record and to reject those evidentiary interpretations and illations that are unreasonable, insupportable, or overly speculative.  See, e.g., United States v.

Under this theory of accomplice liability, Spinney would be guilty only if the government proved (1) that Kirvan (the principal) committed the substantive offense (armed bank robbery), and (2) that Spinney (the accomplice) became associated with the endeavor and took part in it, intending to ensure its success.

In a prosecution for armed bank robbery, this shared knowledge requirement is binary;  it extends both to awareness of the robbery and to comprehension that a weapon would likely be used.  See United States v. Jones, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"403744\"><a href=\"/opinion/403744/united-states-v-chippy-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">678</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span>, 106 (9th Cir.1982) (explaining that, to convict under Sec. 2113(d), the prosecution must \"show that the defendant aided and abetted the principal both in the act of bank robbery and in the principal's use of 'a dangerous weapon or device' during the act\") (citing other cases).  Appellant maintains that neither finding is justified here.  In the first place, he claims that the evidence does not adequately show that he knew Kirvan aspired to rob the Bank and nonetheless endeavored to help him.  In the second place, he claims that the record is devoid of any proof that he knew about the actual or intended use of a gun.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

Rather, he focuses on the lack of direct evidence placing him at the switch site, in or near the Bank, or in Kirvan's company at any time except immediately prior to the commission of the crime, thereby attempting to raise doubts about whether he had any specific intent to assist in the enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is flawed in its presumption that a dearth of direct evidence somehow precludes jurors from drawing logical inferences based on available circumstantial evidence.  Contrary to the burden of appellant's thesis, it is precisely those situations that involve an absence of direct evidence in which circumstantial evidence must be most closely analyzed.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661452\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">O'Brien,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/661452/43-socsecrepser-489-medicaremedicaid-guide-p-42092-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">706</span> </a></span>(explaining that a lack of direct evidence spurs examination of indirect evidence).

Refined to bare essence, appellant's asseveration on this point is that the evidence, taken as a whole, is so sparse that it does not satisfy the Sanborn standard;  there are simply no facts, he tells us, from which a reasonable juror could extrapolate to a finding of shared knowledge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In terms, the Sanborn rubric requires only proof of \"notice of ... likelihood\" to satisfy this prong of the shared knowledge element in connection with a charge of aiding and abetting an armed bank robbery.

Sec. 924(c).  See infra Part III.  The glaring linguistic difference between the two formulations guides our inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knowledge is a concept, not an absolute.  In the law, as in life, \"knowledge\" means different things in different contexts.  Accordingly, we believe it is useful to view the concept as a continuum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At one end of the continuum is what the law commonly calls \"constructive knowledge.\"   Constructive knowledge is the law's way of recognizing that, given an awareness of certain subsidiary facts, a person is quite likely to know, can be expected to know, or at least should know that a further fact exists.  See Black's Law Dictionary 314 (6th ed. 1990) (\"If one by exercise of reasonable care would have known a fact, he is deemed to have had constructive knowledge of said fact....\").  By way of illustration, if an easily visible foreign object is on a staircase for an appreciable length of time, the law accepts the reasonableness of a conclusion that the occupier of the premises \"knew\" of its presence (even though there is no evidence that the occupier actually knew, by observation or report, of the object's whereabouts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the other end of the continuum is what the law commonly calls \"actual knowledge.\"   Actual knowledge, as the term implies, reduces the need for inference;  it suggests the presence of particular evidence which, if credited, establishes conclusively that the person in question knew of the existence of the fact in question.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 873 </span>(defining actual knowledge as \"positive, in contrast to imputed or inferred, knowledge of a fact\").  To carry our example forward, if witnesses testify that the occupier himself placed the foreign object on the stair, or remarked its location, that testimony, if believed, establishes that the occupier actually knew of its presence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The concepts of constructive and actual knowledge do not occupy the entire span of the continuum.  Knowledge varies in origin, degree, and an array of other respects.  These gradations are best visualized as way stations that dot the length of the hypothetical knowledge continuum.  Notice of likelihood fits into the poorly charted area that stretches between the poles of the continuum.  While we believe that, in a criminal case, the reasonable doubt standard requires that notice of likelihood comprise more than constructive knowledge simpliciter, its articulation evokes echoes of constructive knowledge and places the proof requirement closer to that end of the continuum.  Actual knowledge, after all, is certain knowledge, see <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> and likelihood </span>is not the stuff of certainty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Logically, then, the Sanborn rubric implies, in a section 2113(d) case, that the defendant's shared knowledge need not amount to actual knowledge that his cohort intended to use a gun or other dangerous weapon in robbing the bank;  indeed, Sanborn 's disjunctive <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349526\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">phraseology,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/349526/united-states-v-donald-k-sanborn/\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">491</span> </a></span>(\"knew ... or at least ... was on notice of the likelihood\"), leaves no doubt that a conviction can be grounded on something less than actual knowledge.  We conclude that an enhanced showing of constructive knowledge will suffice.  See United States v. Grubczak, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471767\"><a href=\"/opinion/471767/united-states-v-jeffrey-grubczak/\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span>, 463 (2d Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this is a very close case, we think that the evidence clears the notice of likelihood hurdle.

In this case, the scheme called for a lone robber to enter a bank during business hours with the intent of looting it.  One would expect tellers, guards, customers, and other persons unsympathetic to an unauthorized withdrawal of funds to be on the premises.  Under those circumstances, not even the most sanguine criminal would expect clear sailing without some menace in the wind.  In short, the circumstances gave rise to constructive knowledge beforehand that the intruder would need a gun or some other dangerous device to accomplish the felons' agreed goal.  See United States v. Powell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558557\"><a href=\"/opinion/558557/united-states-v-raymond-j-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span>, 727 (D.C.Cir.1991) (stating, in dictum, that \"possession of a gun ... is virtually essential in [perpetrating a bank robbery]\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, moreover, Spinney was not merely a bit player (say, a lookout or a getaway driver), but a leading man.  A jury could reasonably infer from the totality of the attendant circumstances, particularly from the host of telephone calls between Spinney and Kirvan and from Spinney's participation in the elaborate reconnaissance mission, that he had a major role in planning the heist.  Even assuming that there was no specific discussion of the use of a gun, evidence of a defendant's substantial involvement over the course of several days in planning and orchestrating a robbery, when coupled with actual participation in carrying it out, permits a compelling inference that the defendant knew the salient details of the plot (e.g., the timing of the robbery, the bank's identity and location, the planned entry by a lone robber).  These circumstances seem to us to sustain a finding that Spinney was on notice that Kirvan likely would tote a gun in the course of the upcoming robbery.

On this record, despite the lack of direct evidence and the uncertainties associated with that lack, the jury rationally could find Spinney to have been an architect of, and an active participant in, the robbery.  Given these available findings, and the persuasive force of the other permissible inferences supported by the overall circumstances, we cannot say that the jury exceeded its proper province in concluding that Spinney was on notice of the likelihood that Kirvan would use a gun.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349526\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Sanborn,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/349526/united-states-v-donald-k-sanborn/\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

Secs. 2113(d) and 924(c), respectively, at the less taxing end of the knowledge continuum.  We are uncomfortable with this esemplastic approach.  Particularly when juxtaposed with \"notice of ... likelihood,\" we believe that \"practical certainty\" is a rubric that calls for proof verging on actual knowledge, see Model Penal Code Sec. 2.02 at 236 n. 13 (1985) (\"With respect to result elements, one cannot of course 'know' infallibly that a certain result will follow from engaging in conduct, and thus to some extent 'knowledge,' when applied to result elements, includes a contingency factor as well.  This is expressed definitionally in terms of whether the actor is 'practically certain' that the result will follow.\"), and, thus, presents a considerably higher hurdle for the prosecution to overcome.  Nor do we think that we are free to cut this hurdle down to size either by reading significantly dissimilar articulations to denote a single meaning or by treating one of them as a linguistic accident.  Courts invite error when they try to weigh meaning only after placing a thumb on the scale, or when they too freely write off as malapropos words carefully chosen in the past.  If principle is to prevail, we must give effect to the obvious difference in standards of knowledge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the difference is dispositive.  The government's argument boils down to an assertion that the jury could infer that Spinney was practically certain of Kirvan's anticipated use of a gun based on the evidence we have just reviewed, principally the confederates' joint design of the robbery.  Yet, the government adduced no evidence suggesting that firearms were actually contemplated in the planning stages, or that Spinney had any actual knowledge that Kirvan would be armed.  Under the circumstances, we conclude that the government's best evidence (that Spinney helped to mastermind the robbery), taken in the light most favorable to the verdict, even when coupled with the jury's ability to make intuitive judgments, is insufficient to support the requisite inference of practical certainty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558557\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Powell,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/558557/united-states-v-raymond-j-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">729</span></a></span>;  United States v.

Here, Spinney did not even enter the bank, and there was no evidence that Kirvan had the weapon in his possession while he and Spinney were together before the robbery, let alone that it was visible or otherwise detectable at that juncture.  Put bluntly, even though Spinney may have spent much time with Kirvan devising the plan, and was on notice of the likelihood that a gun would be used in the course of the robbery, there is simply no evidence to support a reasoned conclusion that Spinney was practically certain that Kirvan would be armed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, \"likelihood\" and \"practical certainty\" are not equivalent terms.

CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is the rare case in which the evidence, viewed most congenially to the government, passes muster under the notice of likelihood test and, therefore, justifies the appellant's conviction for aiding and abetting an armed bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2113(d), but, nevertheless, fails the practical certainty test and, therefore, does not justify the appellant's conviction for aiding and abetting the principal's use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c).  This result, though it is unusual, does not strike us as strange.  See, e.g., Model Penal Code Sec. 2.02 at 236-37 n. 13 (suggesting that, where knowledge is in issue, it is sometimes \"meaningful to draw a line between practical certainty and awareness of substantial risk\").  So it is here:  though notice of likelihood must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the government can meet this burden by an evidentiary showing less than is required to prove that the defendant knew to a practical certainty that a gun would be used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

Furthermore, defendants convicted of violating Sec. 924(c), unlike defendants convicted of violating Sec. 2113(d), must be given an additional sentence of at least five years, to run consecutively to the term of incarceration imposed for the underlying crime.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1).
