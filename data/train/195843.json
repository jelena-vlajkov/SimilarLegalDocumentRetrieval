Defendant Frederick  Thurlow appeals\r                      Per  Curiam.\r                                  \n\nfrom the  district court's imposition of  a special condition\n\nof  supervised release.   Thurlow  was sentenced  following a\n\nguilty  plea to  three counts  of an  eleven-count indictment\n\nthat  alleged possession  of stolen  mail, theft  of property\n\nused  by the United States Postal  Service and other offenses\n\nresulting  from a  crime spree  engaged in  by Thurlow  and a\n\ncoconspirator.     As  part  of  a   three-year  sentence  of\n\nsupervised release,  the  district court  ordered Thurlow  to\n\nabstain from the  use or  possession of  alcohol and  illegal\n\ndrugs  during   this  period.     Thurlow  argues   that  the\n\nrequirement  of   total  abstinence   from  alcohol  was   an\n\nunwarranted abuse of discretion.  We do not agree.\n\n          Thurlow  argues  that  U.S.S.G.     5D1.3(b), which\n\nrequires  that special  conditions  imposed by  the court  be\n\n\"reasonably related  to the  nature and circumstances  of the\n\noffense   and  the   history   and  characteristics   of  the\n\ndefendant,\" does not authorize  the type of special condition\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nimposed.1  Specifically, Thurlow  claims that he exhibited no\n\nparticular attributes warranting the condition imposed.  \n\n          Thurlow  argues too  much.   Thurlow  comes from  a\n\nfamily with an active history of alcohol abuse and his record\n\nindicated  that substance  abuse was  and continued  to be  a\n\nserious problem for him.   Indeed, Thurlow's counsel admitted\n\nas  much in  the presentence  conference before  the district\n\ncourt.  Cf. United  States v. Ruiz-Garcia, 886 F.2d  474, 476\r                                                     \n\n(1st   Cir.  1989)   (concessions  voluntarily   made  during\n\nsentencing   cannot   be   withdrawn   absent   extraordinary\n\ncircumstances).   Moreover,  the record reveals  that Thurlow\n\nused proceeds  from the  crime spree  to purchase  alcohol on\n\nseveral  occasions.     The  district  court   gave  thorough\n\nconsideration  to the  defendant's  history  in reaching  its\n\ndecision to  impose the  special condition.   Accordingly, we\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  U.S.S.G.   5D1.3 provides in relevant part:\n\n          (b)      The  court   may   impose  other\n          conditions of supervised release,  to the\n          extent    that   such    conditions   are\n          reasonably  related to (1) the nature and\n          circumstances  of  the  offense  and  the\n          history   and   characteristics  of   the\n          defendant,  and  (2)  the  need  for  the\n          sentence   imposed  to   afford  adequate\n          deterrence   to   criminal  conduct,   to\n          protect the public from further crimes of\n          the   defendant,   and  to   provide  the\n          defendant  with   needed  educational  or\n          vocational  training,  medical  care,  or\n          other correctional treatment in  the most\n          effective   manner.      18   U.S.C.     \n          3553(a)(2) and 3583(d).\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nfind no abuse of  discretion.  See United States  v. Johnson,\r                                                                        \n\n998 F.2d  696, 699 (9th Cir. 1993) (no abuse of discretion to\n\nimpose,  along with  other restrictions,  condition requiring\n\nthat defendant  abstain from alcohol use  where defendant had\n\nhistory of substance abuse and  had been involved in alcohol-\n\nrelated incidents).2\n\n          The decision  of the  district court to  impose the\n\nspecial condition of supervised release is affirmed.3\r                                                       affirmed\r                                                               \n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  The cases cited by  Thurlow are not apposite.   He relies\nprincipally on  United States v. Prendergast,  979 F.2d 1289,\r                                                        \n1292-93 (8th  Cir. 1992), in  which the  Eighth Circuit  held\nthat the  district court abused its  discretion in requiring,\ninter   alia,   the   complete   abstinence   from   alcohol.\r                        \nPrendergast is  off the mark,  however, because in  that case\r                       \nthere was no  evidence that  the defendant had  a history  of\nalcoholism.  Id.  See also United States v. Stoural, 990 F.2d\r                                                               \n372  (8th  Cir.  1993)  (relying on  Prendergast  to  reverse\r                                                            \nimposition of condition requiring abstinence from alcohol).  \n\n3.  In  so holding, we do not give approval to the imposition\nof  such a special  condition as a  standard practice without\nevidentiary support for it in the record.\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n",
