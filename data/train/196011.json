Dennis  Sirois appeals the  dismissal\r                                \r\r\n\npursuant  to  28 U.S.C.    1915(d)  of  his pro  se complaint\r                                                               \n\nalleging  constitutionally deficient medical  treatment.  His\n\nsuit under 42 U.S.C.   1983 -- against the prison entity, its\n\nwarden and deputy warden, a medical administrator, a John Doe\n\nnurse,  and the entire medical staff at the prison -- alleged\n\nvarious instances  of failure  to provide  medical treatment.\n\nSpecifically, Sirois  claimed that the defendants  refused to\n\ntreat  an   abscess  that  resulted  from   an  injection  of\n\nmedication  administered on  March  2, 1994.   The  complaint\n\nsought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as monetary\n\ndamages.  The magistrate-judge recommended that the complaint\n\nbe dismissed as frivolous.  Sirois objected, but the district\n\ncourt  adopted the  recommended  decision  and dismissed  the\n\ncomplaint.\n\n          Although  the  district  court  may have  erred  in\n\ndismissing the  complaint as frivolous under    1915(d) since\n\nSirois'  claims  are  at   least  arguable,  see  Neitzke  v.\r                                                                     \n\nWilliams, 490 U.S. 319,  327-28 (1989), we nonetheless affirm\r                    \n\non the basis  that the  error was harmless.

The  condition\r                     \n\nsuffered  as a result of  the injection appears  to have been\n\nrelatively minor.   There are  no allegations  of fever,  and\n\nSirois  was vague about the severity and duration of pain, as\n\nwell  as  the  number of  treatment  requests  made.   It  is\n\nacknowledged that the condition  was treated after the filing\n\nof this  complaint, seemingly to Sirois'  satisfaction.
