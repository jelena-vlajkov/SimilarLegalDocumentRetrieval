R. App. P.\n\n10(e) to correct the record.  We affirm.  \n\n                          BACKGROUND\n\n     On  March 20  1990,  a federal  indictment was  returned\n\ncharging  appellant, Barney  Canada,  and  Gayle Canada  with\n\noperating  an \"advance  fee\" scheme  in which  they allegedly\n\ndefrauded  potential borrowers  by falsely  representing that\n\nthey  could  arrange financing  for them  and then,  when the\n\nfinancing did not occur, refusing to refund the advance fees.\n\nAppellant,  in  particular, was  charged  with  one count  of\n\nconspiracy, see 18 U.S.C.   371, twelve counts of wire fraud,\r                           \n\nsee  18 U.S.C.    1343, and one  count of mail  fraud, see 18\r                                                                      \n\nU.S.C.    1341.    Some  time thereafter,  appellant  made  a\n\nmassive  proffer of documentary  evidence to  the government.\n\nInitial  plea negotiations  apparently failed.   On  July 17,\n\n1990, a  superseding indictment  was  returned which  charged\n\nappellant with an additional count of wire fraud.\n\n     The trial began on March  4, 1991.  In its opening,  the\n\ngovernment outlined  a complex scheme to  defraud which began\n\nin early 1987 when co-defendant Barney Canada set up  various\n\nshell   corporations,  including  a   merchant  bank  on  the\n\nCaribbean island  of Saint  Kitts, and advertised  in various\n\nnewspapers that he  could fund or  arrange funding for  large\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ncommercial projects.  Sometime  in late 1987, Canada enlisted\n\nappellant in his plan.   At the time, appellant  was employed\n\nby  ComFed Advisory  Group,  a subsidiary  of ComFed  Savings\n\nBank.  During  late 1987  and early 1988,  after having  been\n\nterminated by ComFed, appellant held himself out to potential\n\nborrowers as a manager at ComFed and falsely represented that\n\nComFed  would provide them with  funding.  Appellant also set\n\nup  an  account  at the  Bank  of  Boston  called the  ComFed\n\nAdvisory Client Group account.  Prospective  borrowers, whose\n\nadvance fees were  placed in this  account, were misled  into\n\nbelieving that their money  was being held in safe  escrow by\n\nComFed Savings  Bank.  In  February or March  1988, appellant\n\ntook over and operated  through the bank on Saint  Kitts even\n\nthough  it  was never  licensed.   During  the course  of the\n\nconspiracy, appellant  and Canada misled  potential borrowers\n\nin many ways.   Among other things, they misrepresented their\n\nbackground and experience; demanded large advance fees, which\n\nwere to be  held in safe escrow but  were, in fact, converted\n\nto  their personal use; and made no valid attempts to arrange\n\nfinancing for their clients.  \n\n     For his  part, defense counsel painted  a very different\n\npicture.   He submitted  that  the evidence  would show  that\n\nappellant was a  \"patsy,\" who was lulled  into believing that\n\nwhat Canada was doing was legitimate, in part, by appellant's\n\npast dealings with Canada, but also by Canada's employment of\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\na  well-appointed Boston  law firm  and his  association with\n\nformer  Senator Vance  Hartke  of Indiana.   Defense  counsel\n\nfurther submitted that appellant  spent a lot of money  and a\n\nlot  of time  actively attempting  to arrange  loan packages,\n\nthat  he  had  no  intent to  defraud,  and  that  appellant,\n\nhimself, was defrauded by Barney Canada.\n\n     During  five days  of  trial,  the government  submitted\n\nevidence which  strongly showed that appellant  was a knowing\n\nparticipant  in the scheme  to defraud.  On  the sixth day of\n\ntrial,  near the  close of  the government's  case, appellant\n\nexpressed his  desire to  plead guilty.   After conducting  a\n\nthorough  colloquy, in accord with  Fed. R. Crim.  P. 11, the\n\ndistrict  court  accepted  the  change of  plea.    Appellant\n\nadmitted, under  oath, that  potential borrowers had  got the\n\n\"run around.\"  He  also indicated that he was  satisfied with\n\ntrial counsel's  representation and  that his change  of plea\n\nwas voluntary.  On  May 23, 1991, appellant was  sentenced to\n\neighteen   months  imprisonment,  followed  by  a  period  of\n\nsupervised release.  There was no direct appeal.\n\n     On  February 23, 1993, appellant filed a pro se petition\r                                                                \n\nto  vacate his  conviction under  28 U.S.C.    2255  alleging\n\nineffective  assistance  of   trial  counsel,   prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct, and lack of jurisdiction.  The petition was later\n\namended  to allege, as a fourth ground for relief, the denial\n\nof appellant's  rights to due process  and compulsory process\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nbased  on  trial   counsel's  alleged  failure  to   subpoena\n\n\"indispensable  witnesses\"  and   the  government's   alleged\n\nfailure  to extend  immunity to  these witnesses.   With  his\n\npetition,  appellant filed initial and continuing affidavits,\n\nas well as seven  volumes of documentary evidence.   On March\n\n1, 1993,  appellant filed various motions  including a motion\n\nfor  the   appointment  of   \"assistant\"  counsel,   for  the\n\nproduction of grand  jury minutes documenting attendance  and\n\nvoting,   for  the  production   of  trial   transcripts  [at\n\ngovernment expense], and for  an evidentiary hearing and oral\n\nargument for the purpose of introducing \"documentary evidence\n\nwithout  limitation.\"   These motions  were denied.   In  May\n\n1993,  appellant  filed  a  motion for  summary  judgment,  a\n\ndiscovery request, and  a motion for expansion  of the record\n\nto  include  all documentary  materials  referred  to in  the\n\ninitial and continuing affidavits.  The district court denied\n\nthese motions on September  16, 1993.  On September  21, 1993\n\nthe  district court  denied the    2255 petition.   Appellant\n\nfiled a timely notice of appeal.\n\n     On  March 14,  1994, after  filing his  appellate brief,\n\nappellant  filed a motion in the district court under Fed. R.\n\nApp.  P. 10(e) for correction of the transcript of the change\n\nof  plea hearing.    Appellant alleged  that this  transcript\n\nomitted a statement that he had made in open court protesting\n\nhis innocence and blaming his attorney for failing to procure\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nwitnesses.    In  opposition,  the  government  provided  the\n\ndistrict court with  a statement from the court  reporter re-\n\ncertifying the accuracy of the transcript based on his review\n\nof  his notes and the  voice recording of  the plea colloquy.\n\nThe government also submitted  an affidavit by the prosecutor\n\non  appeal attesting to the accuracy  of the transcript based\n\non her own review of the voice recording.  The district court\n\ndenied the Rule 10(e) motion without evidentiary hearing, and\n\nappellant  appealed.    We subsequently  granted  appellant's\n\nmotion to consolidate the two appeals.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n\n     As an  initial matter,  we observe  that when  a dispute\n\nconcerning the  accuracy of the record has  been submitted to\n\nthe district court, \"the  court's determination is conclusive\n\n`absent  a  showing  of  intentional falsification  or  plain\n\nunreasonableness.'\"  United States v. Serrano, 870 F.2d 1, 12\r                                                         \n\n(1st Cir. 1989) (quoting United States v. Mori, 444 F.2d 240,\r                                                          \n\n246  (5th Cir.), cert. denied,  404 U.S. 913  (1971)).  There\r                                         \n\nhas been no such showing here, and appellant fails to advance\n\nany  persuasive reason why an evidentiary hearing on his Rule\n\n10(e)  motion   was  necessary.     Accordingly,   we  reject\n\nappellant's argument that the district court erred in denying\n\nhis  Rule 10(e) motion, and  we accept the  transcript of the\n\nchange of plea hearing as an accurate record.\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n     We turn  next to appellant's allegations  that his trial\n\ncounsel rendered  ineffective  assistance.   A defendant  who\n\npleads guilty  and later  seeks to  set aside  his conviction\n\nbased   on  inadequate  counsel  must  demonstrate  that  his\n\ncounsel's  performance fell  below an  objective  standard of\n\nreasonableness and  \"a reasonable  probability that,  but for\n\ncounsel's errors, he  would not have pleaded guilty and would\n\nhave insisted on going to trial.\"  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S.\r                                                               \n\n52, 56-59 (1985).   We accept statements made by  the accused\n\nin  a change  of plea  proceeding as  true, unless  he offers\n\n\"credible, valid  reasons why a departure  from those earlier\n\ncontradictory  statements  is  now  justified.\"    Hernandez-\r                                                                         \n\nHernandez v. United States, 904 F.2d 758, 762 (1st Cir. 1990)\r                                      \n\n(quoting United States  v. Butt,  731 F.2d 75,  80 (1st  Cir.\r                                           \n\n1984)).  \n\n     Applying  these  standards,  we  cannot  say   that  the\n\ndistrict  court  erred  in  rejecting  appellant's  claim  of\n\nineffective assistance based on \"distracted\" and \"unprepared\"\n\ncounsel.   Appellant's principal complaint is  that his trial\n\ncounsel did not have a \"working knowledge\" of the one hundred\n\nand  twenty-five volumes  of  documentary evidence  appellant\n\nprovided him  and failed  to  ensure that  appellant had  the\n\nwitnesses he needed in his defense.  However, trial counsel's\n\nperformance  before  and  during   the  five  days  of  trial\n\ndemonstrates that he was  focused and well-prepared.  Counsel\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nfiled   many   pre-trial  motions   on   appellant's  behalf,\n\neffectively  cross-examined  the government's  witnesses, and\n\nintroduced numerous  documents into evidence.   Counsel  also\n\nsubmitted a  proposed witness  list  of approximately  thirty\n\nwitnesses  and  subpoenaed   three  out-of-state   witnesses,\n\nincluding Senator Vance Hartke, Jan Hartke, and Bob Schatz.\n\n     Moreover,  appellant fails  to  offer  any valid  reason\n\nwhich would  explain why  he expressed his  satisfaction with\n\ntrial counsel at the plea colloquy when he now claims that he\n\nwas  forced  to  plead  guilty  because  of  trial  counsel's\n\nincompetence.     In   particular,  we   reject   appellant's\n\nsuggestion that he was misled  when trial counsel advised him\n\nthat attorneys Barry Klickstein  and Paul Roberts, members of\n\nthe law firm employed by  Barney Canada, would be unavailable\n\nto testify  on appellant's behalf.   Although these attorneys\n\nhad  indicated their  intention, if  called as  witnesses, to\n\nexercise  their Fifth  Amendment privilege,  appellant argues\n\nthat there  are various ways his attorney could have resolved\n\nthe dilemma.  Evaluating trial counsel's practical advice, as\n\nwe must, from his perspective at the time, we cannot say that\n\nit fell below  an objective level of  competency.  Klickstein\n\nand  Roberts  appeared  to   be  additional  targets  of  the\n\ngovernment's  investigation,  making  it  unlikely  that  the\n\ngovernment  would seek  formal  immunity for  them.   See  18\r                                                                     \n\nU.S.C.     6003.   In addition,  most  courts have  held that\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\njudges are powerless  to confer immunity.   United States  v.\r                                                                     \n\nAngiulo, 897  F.2d 1169, 1191 (1st  Cir.) (collecting cases),\r                   \n\ncert. denied, 498 U.S. 845 (1990).1  \r                        \n\n     Appellant  also  urges   that  his  trial   counsel  was\n\nineffective because he operated under a conflict of interest.\n\nAccording to appellant, trial  counsel was a former colleague\n\nof  attorney  Bruce  Singal, who  had  represented  appellant\n\nduring  some of  the period  covered by  the indictment.   It\n\nappears  from  the  materials  filed  that   appellant  hired\n\nAttorney  Singal  on  or about  the  time  the  FBI began  to\n\ninvestigate the  financing scheme.    Appellant also  alleges\n\nthat  trial counsel went to  law school with  Jan Hartke, the\n\nson  of  Senator  Vance  Hartke.    Senator  Hartke,  also an\n\nattorney,  had been hired as a special consultant to the bank\n\non Saint  Kitts.  Appellant  apparently wished  to call  both\n\nSenator Hartke and Attorney Singal in support of a defense of\n\nadvice  of counsel,  but  trial counsel  advised against  it.\n\nAppellant  now suggests that trial counsel's advice proceeded\n\nfrom  his loyalty towards Singal and to the Hartkes, and that\n\nit conflicted with appellant's interests.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Although  a trial  judge  might refuse  to entertain  the\nprosecution  if  it found  that  defense  testimony had  been\nthwarted by prosecutorial misconduct, see United States v. De\r                                                                         \nLa Cruz, 996 F.2d 1307, 1313 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 114 S.\r                                                                 \nCt.  356  (1993), there  would have  been,  in this  case, no\napparent basis to urge such a finding.  \n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n     To  demonstrate  an  actual  conflict   of  interest,  a\n\ndefendant  must  show  that  a  defense  strategy  or  tactic\n\ninherently in  conflict with his  attorney's other  loyalties\n\npossessed  sufficient substance  to be a  viable alternative.\n\nUnited  States v. Fahey, 769  F.2d 829, 836  (1st Cir. 1985).\r                                   \n\nBased  on  the record,  we do  not  think that  appellant has\n\nsustained  this burden.  There  is no evidence, and appellant\n\ndoes not allege, that either Hartke or Singal were kept fully\n\ninformed  of  all  important   and  material  facts  or  that\n\nappellant acted strictly in  accord with their advice  in his\n\ndealings  with prospective  borrowers.   See  Liss v.  United\r                                                                         \n\nStates, 915 F.2d 287 (7th  Cir. 1990) (setting forth elements\r                  \n\nof  \"advice   of  counsel\"   defense).    Indeed,   based  on\n\nappellant's affidavits  and exhibits, it appears  that Hartke\n\nand  Singal had limited roles as legal counsel in the instant\n\nmatter.  Hartke  allegedly provided some guidance to the bank\n\non  Saint Kitts during its \"early affairs.\"  Singal was hired\n\nafter  most of the acts charged in the indictment had already\n\ntaken  place.2  Since an advice of counsel defense built upon\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  In one of the exhibits filed below, appellant states that\nhe  employed Attorney  Singal between  June and  August 1988.\nMost  of the acts  charged in the  indictment occurred during\n1987 and the first half of 1988.\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\ntheir  testimony was not a viable alternative, we do not find\n\nan actual conflict of interest.3\n\n     We need  not linger  long on appellant's  allegations of\n\nprosecutorial  misconduct.   Appellant contends,  inter alia,\r                                                                        \n\nthat the prosecution employed  perjured testimony before  the\n\ngrand  jury, failed  to present  exculpatory evidence  to the\n\nsecond  grand jury,  engaged  in  selective prosecution,  and\n\nfailed  to  grant  immunity  to witnesses  essential  to  his\n\ndefense.   We  express  no opinion  on  the merits  of  these\n\nclaims.    A knowing  and  voluntary guilty  plea  waives all\n\nnonjurisdictional defects.  United  States v. Broce, 488 U.S.\r                                                               \n\n563, 569 (1989); Valencia v. United States, 923 F.2d 917, 920\r                                                      \n\n(1st Cir.  1991).   Since  appellant has  made no  persuasive\n\nargument that actions by  the prosecution rendered his guilty\n\nplea   involuntary,  his   claims   based  on   prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct are foreclosed.   \n\n     Finally,  we  turn  to  appellant's  argument  that  the\n\ndistrict   court  should  have  granted  him  an  evidentiary\n\nhearing.   Under Rule 4 of the Rules Governing Proceedings in\n\nthe U.S. District Courts under   2255, the district court was\n\nentitled to  dismiss the  petition if  it appeared  \"from the\n\nface of the  motion and  any annexed exhibits  and the  prior\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  We add  that  trial counsel's  advice against  proceeding\nwith  Senator  Hartke as  a witness  appears  to have  been a\nstrategic  decision.   Hartke  had  indicated  that he  would\n\"bury\" appellant if called to testify.\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nproceedings  in the case that  the movant is  not entitled to\n\nrelief . . . \"  We have clarified that when, as in this case,\n\na   2255 petition is presented to the judge who presided over\n\nthe trial, \"the judge  is at liberty to employ  the knowledge\n\ngleaned during previous proceedings and make findings thereon\n\nwithout convening  an additional hearing.\"   United States v.\r                                                                      \n\nMcGill, 11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir. 1993).  \r                  \n\n     In the instant case, the  familiarity of the judge  with\n\nthe  case obviated the need  for an evidentiary  hearing.  In\n\nparticular,  we reject  appellant's  suggestion that  he  was\n\nentitled to an evidentiary hearing so that he could introduce\n\ndocumentary  material \"without  limitation.\"    Based  on his\n\naffidavits,  appellant  had   assembled  this  material   and\n\npresented it to  trial counsel  prior to the  change of  plea\n\nhearing in which he indicated his satisfaction with counsel's\n\nrepresentation.   Since  the district  court was  entitled to\n\naccept his statements at  the Rule 11 proceeding as  true, it\n\ncould  properly  reject his  claim  of inadequate  assistance\n\nwithout further inquiry into  the contents of these materials\n\nor counsel's alleged failure  to master them. We add  that to\n\nthe  extent  these  documentary materials  were  relevant  to\n\nappellant's   claims   of   prosecutorial    misconduct,   no\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nevidentiary  hearing  was necessary  since  these  claims are\n\nwaived.4\n\n     Having found  that the district  court properly rejected\n\nthe instant  petition based  upon  the papers  filed and  the\n\nprior proceedings, we need  not discuss in detail appellant's\n\nclaim  that he was entitled to summary judgment in his favor.\n\nWe observe, however,  that any failure  by the government  to\n\nadequately  respond to  appellant's filings  does not,  as he\n\nsuggests, automatically entitle him to relief.

Michael Any (\"appellant\") appeals pro se the denial of his petition under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255 to vacate his conviction, as well as his motion under Fed.  R. App.  P. 10(e) to correct the record.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 20 1990, a federal indictment was returned charging appellant, Barney Canada, and Gayle Canada with operating an \"advance fee\" scheme in which they allegedly defrauded potential borrowers by falsely representing that they could arrange financing for them and then, when the financing did not occur, refusing to refund the advance fees.  Appellant, in particular, was charged with one count of conspiracy, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371, twelve counts of wire fraud, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343, and one count of mail fraud, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341.  Some time thereafter, appellant made a massive proffer of documentary evidence to the government.  Initial plea negotiations apparently failed.  On July 17, 1990, a superseding indictment was returned which charged appellant with an additional count of wire fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial began on March 4, 1991.  In its opening, the government outlined a complex scheme to defraud which began in early 1987 when co-defendant Barney Canada set up various shell corporations, including a merchant bank on the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts, and advertised in various newspapers that he could fund or arrange funding for large commercial projects.  Sometime in late 1987, Canada enlisted appellant in his plan.  At the time, appellant was employed by ComFed Advisory Group, a subsidiary of ComFed Savings Bank.  During late 1987 and early 1988, after having been terminated by ComFed, appellant held himself out to potential borrowers as a manager at ComFed and falsely represented that ComFed would provide them with funding.  Appellant also set up an account at the Bank of Boston called the ComFed Advisory Client Group account.  Prospective borrowers, whose advance fees were placed in this account, were misled into believing that their money was being held in safe escrow by ComFed Savings Bank.  In February or March 1988, appellant took over and operated through the bank on Saint Kitts even though it was never licensed.  During the course of the conspiracy, appellant and Canada misled potential borrowers in many ways.  Among other things, they misrepresented their background and experience;  demanded large advance fees, which were to be held in safe escrow but were, in fact, converted to their personal use;  and made no valid attempts to arrange financing for their clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For his part, defense counsel painted a very different picture.  He submitted that the evidence would show that appellant was a \"patsy,\" who was lulled into believing that what Canada was doing was legitimate, in part, by appellant's past dealings with Canada, but also by Canada's employment of a well-appointed Boston law firm and his association with former Senator Vance Hartke of Indiana.  Defense counsel further submitted that appellant spent a lot of money and a lot of time actively attempting to arrange loan packages, that he had no intent to defraud, and that appellant, himself, was defrauded by Barney Canada.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During five days of trial, the government submitted evidence which strongly showed that appellant was a knowing participant in the scheme to defraud.  On the sixth day of trial, near the close of the government's case, appellant expressed his desire to plead guilty.  After conducting a thorough colloquy, in accord with Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 11, the district court accepted the change of plea.  Appellant admitted, under oath, that potential borrowers had got the \"run around.\"  He also indicated that he was satisfied with trial counsel's representation and that his change of plea was voluntary.  On May 23, 1991, appellant was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment, followed by a period of supervised release.  There was no direct appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 23, 1993, appellant filed a pro se petition to vacate his conviction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255 alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, and lack of jurisdiction.  The petition was later amended to allege, as a fourth ground for relief, the denial of appellant's rights to due process and compulsory process based on trial counsel's alleged failure to subpoena \"indispensable witnesses\" and the government's alleged failure to extend immunity to these witnesses.  With his petition, appellant filed initial and continuing affidavits, as well as seven volumes of documentary evidence.  On March 1, 1993, appellant filed various motions including a motion for the appointment of \"assistant\" counsel, for the production of grand jury minutes documenting attendance and voting, for the production of trial transcripts [at government expense], and for an evidentiary hearing and oral argument for the purpose of introducing \"documentary evidence without limitation.\"  These motions were denied.  In May 1993, appellant filed a motion for summary judgment, a discovery request, and a motion for expansion of the record to include all documentary materials referred to in the initial and continuing affidavits.  The district court denied these motions on September 16, 1993.  On September 21, 1993 the district court denied the Sec. 2255 petition.  Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 14, 1994, after filing his appellate brief, appellant filed a motion in the district court under Fed.  R. App.  P. 10(e) for correction of the transcript of the change of plea hearing.  Appellant alleged that this transcript omitted a statement that he had made in open court protesting his innocence and blaming his attorney for failing to procure witnesses.  In opposition, the government provided the district court with a statement from the court reporter re-certifying the accuracy of the transcript based on his review of his notes and the voice recording of the plea colloquy.  The government also submitted an affidavit by the prosecutor on appeal attesting to the accuracy of the transcript based on her own review of the voice recording.  The district court denied the Rule 10(e) motion without evidentiary hearing, and appellant appealed.  We subsequently granted appellant's motion to consolidate the two appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, we observe that when a dispute concerning the accuracy of the record has been submitted to the district court, \"the court's determination is conclusive 'absent a showing of intentional falsification or plain unreasonableness.' \"  United States v. Serrano, 870 F.2d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 1989) (quoting United States v. Mori, 444 F.2d 240, 246 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 913 (1971)).  There has been no such showing here, and appellant fails to advance any persuasive reason why an evidentiary hearing on his Rule 10(e) motion was necessary.  Accordingly, we reject appellant's argument that the district court erred in denying his Rule 10(e) motion, and we accept the transcript of the change of plea hearing as an accurate record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to appellant's allegations that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance.  A defendant who pleads guilty and later seeks to set aside his conviction based on inadequate counsel must demonstrate that his counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\"  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 56-59 (1985).  We accept statements made by the accused in a change of plea proceeding as true, unless he offers \"credible, valid reasons why a departure from those earlier contradictory statements is now justified.\"  Hernandez-Hernandez v. United States, 904 F.2d 758, 762 (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting United States v. Butt, 731 F.2d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these standards, we cannot say that the district court erred in rejecting appellant's claim of ineffective assistance based on \"distracted\" and \"unprepared\" counsel.  Appellant's principal complaint is that his trial counsel did not have a \"working knowledge\" of the one hundred and twenty- five volumes of documentary evidence appellant provided him and failed to ensure that appellant had the witnesses he needed in his defense.  However, trial counsel's performance before and during the five days of trial demonstrates that he was focused and well-prepared.  Counsel filed many pre-trial motions on appellant's behalf, effectively cross-examined the government's witnesses, and introduced numerous documents into evidence.  Counsel also submitted a proposed witness list of approximately thirty witnesses and subpoenaed three out-of-state witnesses, including Senator Vance Hartke, Jan Hartke, and Bob Schatz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, appellant fails to offer any valid reason which would explain why he expressed his satisfaction with trial counsel at the plea colloquy when he now claims that he was forced to plead guilty because of trial counsel's incompetence.  In particular, we reject appellant's suggestion that he was misled when trial counsel advised him that attorneys Barry Klickstein and Paul Roberts, members of the law firm employed by Barney Canada, would be unavailable to testify on appellant's behalf.  Although these attorneys had indicated their intention, if called as witnesses, to exercise their Fifth Amendment privilege, appellant argues that there are various ways his attorney could have resolved the dilemma.  Evaluating trial counsel's practical advice, as we must, from his perspective at the time, we cannot say that it fell below an objective level of competency.  Klickstein and Roberts appeared to be additional targets of the government's investigation, making it unlikely that the government would seek formal immunity for them.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 6003.  In addition, most courts have held that judges are powerless to confer immunity.  United States v. Angiulo, 897 F.2d 1169, 1191 (1st Cir.)  (collecting cases), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 845 (1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also urges that his trial counsel was ineffective because he operated under a conflict of interest.  According to appellant, trial counsel was a former colleague of attorney Bruce Singal, who had represented appellant during some of the period covered by the indictment.  It appears from the materials filed that appellant hired Attorney Singal on or about the time the FBI began to investigate the financing scheme.  Appellant also alleges that trial counsel went to law school with Jan Hartke, the son of Senator Vance Hartke.  Senator Hartke, also an attorney, had been hired as a special consultant to the bank on Saint Kitts.  Appellant apparently wished to call both Senator Hartke and Attorney Singal in support of a defense of advice of counsel, but trial counsel advised against it.  Appellant now suggests that trial counsel's advice proceeded from his loyalty towards Singal and to the Hartkes, and that it conflicted with appellant's interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To demonstrate an actual conflict of interest, a defendant must show that a defense strategy or tactic inherently in conflict with his attorney's other loyalties possessed sufficient substance to be a viable alternative.  United States v. Fahey, 769 F.2d 829, 836 (1st Cir. 1985).  Based on the record, we do not think that appellant has sustained this burden.  There is no evidence, and appellant does not allege, that either Hartke or Singal were kept fully informed of all important and material facts or that appellant acted strictly in accord with their advice in his dealings with prospective borrowers.  See Liss v. United States, 915 F.2d 287 (7th Cir. 1990) (setting forth elements of \"advice of counsel\" defense).  Indeed, based on appellant's affidavits and exhibits, it appears that Hartke and Singal had limited roles as legal counsel in the instant matter.  Hartke allegedly provided some guidance to the bank on Saint Kitts during its \"early affairs.\"  Singal was hired after most of the acts charged in the indictment had already taken place.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Since an advice of counsel defense built upon their testimony was not a viable alternative, we do not find an actual conflict of interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not linger long on appellant's allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.  Appellant contends, inter alia, that the prosecution employed perjured testimony before the grand jury, failed to present exculpatory evidence to the second grand jury, engaged in selective prosecution, and failed to grant immunity to witnesses essential to his defense.  We express no opinion on the merits of these claims.  A knowing and voluntary guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional defects.  United States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, 569 (1989);  Valencia v. United States, 923 F.2d 917, 920 (1st Cir. 1991).  Since appellant has made no persuasive argument that actions by the prosecution rendered his guilty plea involuntary, his claims based on prosecutorial misconduct are foreclosed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we turn to appellant's argument that the district court should have granted him an evidentiary hearing.  Under Rule 4 of the Rules Governing Proceedings in the U.S. District Courts under Sec. 2255, the district court was entitled to dismiss the petition if it appeared \"from the face of the motion and any annexed exhibits and the prior proceedings in the case that the movant is not entitled to relief ... \" We have clarified that when, as in this case, a Sec. 2255 petition is presented to the judge who presided over the trial, \"the judge is at liberty to employ the knowledge gleaned during previous proceedings and make findings thereon without convening an additional hearing.\"  United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the familiarity of the judge with the case obviated the need for an evidentiary hearing.  In particular, we reject appellant's suggestion that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing so that he could introduce documentary material \"without limitation.\"  Based on his affidavits, appellant had assembled this material and presented it to trial counsel prior to the change of plea hearing in which he indicated his satisfaction with counsel's representation.  Since the district court was entitled to accept his statements at the Rule 11 proceeding as true, it could properly reject his claim of inadequate assistance without further inquiry into the contents of these materials or counsel's alleged failure to master them.  We add that to the extent these documentary materials were relevant to appellant's claims of prosecutorial misconduct, no evidentiary hearing was necessary since these claims are waived.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found that the district court properly rejected the instant petition based upon the papers filed and the prior proceedings, we need not discuss in detail appellant's claim that he was entitled to summary judgment in his favor.  We observe, however, that any failure by the government to adequately respond to appellant's filings does not, as he suggests, automatically entitle him to relief.  Cf. Jaroma v. Massey, 873 F.2d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 1989) (stating that the district court cannot grant a motion for summary judgment merely for lack of any response by the opposing party).  In so observing, we express no opinion on whether the government's response was adequate or inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have carefully considered appellant's remaining arguments and reject them as without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although a trial judge might refuse to entertain the prosecution if it found that defense testimony had been thwarted by prosecutorial misconduct, see United States v. De La Cruz, 996 F.2d 1307, 1313 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 356 (1993), there would have been, in this case, no apparent basis to urge such a finding</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In one of the exhibits filed below, appellant states that he employed Attorney Singal between June and August 1988.

Michael Any (\"appellant\") appeals pro se the denial of his petition under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255 to vacate his conviction, as well as his motion under Fed.  R. App.  P. 10(e) to correct the record.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 20 1990, a federal indictment was returned charging appellant, Barney Canada, and Gayle Canada with operating an \"advance fee\" scheme in which they allegedly defrauded potential borrowers by falsely representing that they could arrange financing for them and then, when the financing did not occur, refusing to refund the advance fees.  Appellant, in particular, was charged with one count of conspiracy, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371, twelve counts of wire fraud, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343, and one count of mail fraud, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341.  Some time thereafter, appellant made a massive proffer of documentary evidence to the government.  Initial plea negotiations apparently failed.  On July 17, 1990, a superseding indictment was returned which charged appellant with an additional count of wire fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial began on March 4, 1991.  In its opening, the government outlined a complex scheme to defraud which began in early 1987 when co-defendant Barney Canada set up various shell corporations, including a merchant bank on the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts, and advertised in various newspapers that he could fund or arrange funding for large commercial projects.  Sometime in late 1987, Canada enlisted appellant in his plan.  At the time, appellant was employed by ComFed Advisory Group, a subsidiary of ComFed Savings Bank.  During late 1987 and early 1988, after having been terminated by ComFed, appellant held himself out to potential borrowers as a manager at ComFed and falsely represented that ComFed would provide them with funding.  Appellant also set up an account at the Bank of Boston called the ComFed Advisory Client Group account.  Prospective borrowers, whose advance fees were placed in this account, were misled into believing that their money was being held in safe escrow by ComFed Savings Bank.  In February or March 1988, appellant took over and operated through the bank on Saint Kitts even though it was never licensed.  During the course of the conspiracy, appellant and Canada misled potential borrowers in many ways.  Among other things, they misrepresented their background and experience;  demanded large advance fees, which were to be held in safe escrow but were, in fact, converted to their personal use;  and made no valid attempts to arrange financing for their clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For his part, defense counsel painted a very different picture.  He submitted that the evidence would show that appellant was a \"patsy,\" who was lulled into believing that what Canada was doing was legitimate, in part, by appellant's past dealings with Canada, but also by Canada's employment of a well-appointed Boston law firm and his association with former Senator Vance Hartke of Indiana.  Defense counsel further submitted that appellant spent a lot of money and a lot of time actively attempting to arrange loan packages, that he had no intent to defraud, and that appellant, himself, was defrauded by Barney Canada.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During five days of trial, the government submitted evidence which strongly showed that appellant was a knowing participant in the scheme to defraud.  On the sixth day of trial, near the close of the government's case, appellant expressed his desire to plead guilty.  After conducting a thorough colloquy, in accord with Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 11, the district court accepted the change of plea.  Appellant admitted, under oath, that potential borrowers had got the \"run around.\"  He also indicated that he was satisfied with trial counsel's representation and that his change of plea was voluntary.  On May 23, 1991, appellant was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment, followed by a period of supervised release.  There was no direct appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 23, 1993, appellant filed a pro se petition to vacate his conviction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255 alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, and lack of jurisdiction.  The petition was later amended to allege, as a fourth ground for relief, the denial of appellant's rights to due process and compulsory process based on trial counsel's alleged failure to subpoena \"indispensable witnesses\" and the government's alleged failure to extend immunity to these witnesses.  With his petition, appellant filed initial and continuing affidavits, as well as seven volumes of documentary evidence.  On March 1, 1993, appellant filed various motions including a motion for the appointment of \"assistant\" counsel, for the production of grand jury minutes documenting attendance and voting, for the production of trial transcripts [at government expense], and for an evidentiary hearing and oral argument for the purpose of introducing \"documentary evidence without limitation.\"  These motions were denied.  In May 1993, appellant filed a motion for summary judgment, a discovery request, and a motion for expansion of the record to include all documentary materials referred to in the initial and continuing affidavits.  The district court denied these motions on September 16, 1993.  On September 21, 1993 the district court denied the Sec. 2255 petition.  Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 14, 1994, after filing his appellate brief, appellant filed a motion in the district court under Fed.  R. App.  P. 10(e) for correction of the transcript of the change of plea hearing.  Appellant alleged that this transcript omitted a statement that he had made in open court protesting his innocence and blaming his attorney for failing to procure witnesses.  In opposition, the government provided the district court with a statement from the court reporter re-certifying the accuracy of the transcript based on his review of his notes and the voice recording of the plea colloquy.  The government also submitted an affidavit by the prosecutor on appeal attesting to the accuracy of the transcript based on her own review of the voice recording.  The district court denied the Rule 10(e) motion without evidentiary hearing, and appellant appealed.  We subsequently granted appellant's motion to consolidate the two appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, we observe that when a dispute concerning the accuracy of the record has been submitted to the district court, \"the court's determination is conclusive 'absent a showing of intentional falsification or plain unreasonableness.' \"  United States v. Serrano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"519968\"><a href=\"/opinion/519968/united-states-v-miguel-a-serrano-dba-ponce-developers-inc-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir. 1989) (quoting United States v. Mori, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"297388\"><a href=\"/opinion/297388/united-states-v-jean-robert-mori/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span>, 246 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">913</span> </span>(1971)).  There has been no such showing here, and appellant fails to advance any persuasive reason why an evidentiary hearing on his Rule 10(e) motion was necessary.  Accordingly, we reject appellant's argument that the district court erred in denying his Rule 10(e) motion, and we accept the transcript of the change of plea hearing as an accurate record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to appellant's allegations that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance.  A defendant who pleads guilty and later seeks to set aside his conviction based on inadequate counsel must demonstrate that his counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\"  Hill v. Lockhart, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111539\"><a href=\"/opinion/111539/hill-v-lockhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 56-59 (1985).  We accept statements made by the accused in a change of plea proceeding as true, unless he offers \"credible, valid reasons why a departure from those earlier contradictory statements is now justified.\"  Hernandez-Hernandez v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542854\"><a href=\"/opinion/542854/arnaldo-hernandez-hernandez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></a></span>, 762 (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting United States v. Butt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"433521\"><a href=\"/opinion/433521/united-states-v-mohammed-y-butt/\"><span class=\"volume\">731</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 80 (1st Cir. 1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these standards, we cannot say that the district court erred in rejecting appellant's claim of ineffective assistance based on \"distracted\" and \"unprepared\" counsel.  Appellant's principal complaint is that his trial counsel did not have a \"working knowledge\" of the one hundred and twenty- five volumes of documentary evidence appellant provided him and failed to ensure that appellant had the witnesses he needed in his defense.  However, trial counsel's performance before and during the five days of trial demonstrates that he was focused and well-prepared.  Counsel filed many pre-trial motions on appellant's behalf, effectively cross-examined the government's witnesses, and introduced numerous documents into evidence.  Counsel also submitted a proposed witness list of approximately thirty witnesses and subpoenaed three out-of-state witnesses, including Senator Vance Hartke, Jan Hartke, and Bob Schatz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, appellant fails to offer any valid reason which would explain why he expressed his satisfaction with trial counsel at the plea colloquy when he now claims that he was forced to plead guilty because of trial counsel's incompetence.  In particular, we reject appellant's suggestion that he was misled when trial counsel advised him that attorneys Barry Klickstein and Paul Roberts, members of the law firm employed by Barney Canada, would be unavailable to testify on appellant's behalf.  Although these attorneys had indicated their intention, if called as witnesses, to exercise their Fifth Amendment privilege, appellant argues that there are various ways his attorney could have resolved the dilemma.  Evaluating trial counsel's practical advice, as we must, from his perspective at the time, we cannot say that it fell below an objective level of competency.  Klickstein and Roberts appeared to be additional targets of the government's investigation, making it unlikely that the government would seek formal immunity for them.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 6003.  In addition, most courts have held that judges are powerless to confer immunity.  United States v. Angiulo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537726\"><a href=\"/opinion/537726/united-states-v-gennaro-j-angiulo-donato-f-angiulo-samuel-s-granito/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1169</span></a></span>, 1191 (1st Cir.)  (collecting cases), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">845</span> </span>(1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also urges that his trial counsel was ineffective because he operated under a conflict of interest.  According to appellant, trial counsel was a former colleague of attorney Bruce Singal, who had represented appellant during some of the period covered by the indictment.  It appears from the materials filed that appellant hired Attorney Singal on or about the time the FBI began to investigate the financing scheme.  Appellant also alleges that trial counsel went to law school with Jan Hartke, the son of Senator Vance Hartke.  Senator Hartke, also an attorney, had been hired as a special consultant to the bank on Saint Kitts.  Appellant apparently wished to call both Senator Hartke and Attorney Singal in support of a defense of advice of counsel, but trial counsel advised against it.  Appellant now suggests that trial counsel's advice proceeded from his loyalty towards Singal and to the Hartkes, and that it conflicted with appellant's interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To demonstrate an actual conflict of interest, a defendant must show that a defense strategy or tactic inherently in conflict with his attorney's other loyalties possessed sufficient substance to be a viable alternative.  United States v. Fahey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"456323\"><a href=\"/opinion/456323/united-states-v-joseph-p-fahey/\"><span class=\"volume\">769</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">829</span></a></span>, 836 (1st Cir. 1985).  Based on the record, we do not think that appellant has sustained this burden.  There is no evidence, and appellant does not allege, that either Hartke or Singal were kept fully informed of all important and material facts or that appellant acted strictly in accord with their advice in his dealings with prospective borrowers.  See Liss v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548727\"><a href=\"/opinion/548727/philip-liss-also-known-as-gerald-l-drazin-also-known-as-john-doe-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span> </a></span>(7th Cir. 1990) (setting forth elements of \"advice of counsel\" defense).  Indeed, based on appellant's affidavits and exhibits, it appears that Hartke and Singal had limited roles as legal counsel in the instant matter.  Hartke allegedly provided some guidance to the bank on Saint Kitts during its \"early affairs.\"  Singal was hired after most of the acts charged in the indictment had already taken place.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Since an advice of counsel defense built upon their testimony was not a viable alternative, we do not find an actual conflict of interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not linger long on appellant's allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.  Appellant contends, inter alia, that the prosecution employed perjured testimony before the grand jury, failed to present exculpatory evidence to the second grand jury, engaged in selective prosecution, and failed to grant immunity to witnesses essential to his defense.  We express no opinion on the merits of these claims.  A knowing and voluntary guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional defects.  United States v. Broce, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112177\"><a href=\"/opinion/112177/united-states-v-broce/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span>, 569 (1989);  Valencia v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554889\"><a href=\"/opinion/554889/jesus-geles-valencia-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">917</span></a></span>, 920 (1st Cir. 1991).  Since appellant has made no persuasive argument that actions by the prosecution rendered his guilty plea involuntary, his claims based on prosecutorial misconduct are foreclosed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we turn to appellant's argument that the district court should have granted him an evidentiary hearing.  Under Rule 4 of the Rules Governing Proceedings in the U.S. District Courts under Sec. 2255, the district court was entitled to dismiss the petition if it appeared \"from the face of the motion and any annexed exhibits and the prior proceedings in the case that the movant is not entitled to relief ... \" We have clarified that when, as in this case, a Sec. 2255 petition is presented to the judge who presided over the trial, \"the judge is at liberty to employ the knowledge gleaned during previous proceedings and make findings thereon without convening an additional hearing.\"  United States v. McGill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195053\"><a href=\"/opinion/195053/united-states-v-mcgill/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 225 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the familiarity of the judge with the case obviated the need for an evidentiary hearing.  In particular, we reject appellant's suggestion that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing so that he could introduce documentary material \"without limitation.\"  Based on his affidavits, appellant had assembled this material and presented it to trial counsel prior to the change of plea hearing in which he indicated his satisfaction with counsel's representation.  Since the district court was entitled to accept his statements at the Rule 11 proceeding as true, it could properly reject his claim of inadequate assistance without further inquiry into the contents of these materials or counsel's alleged failure to master them.  We add that to the extent these documentary materials were relevant to appellant's claims of prosecutorial misconduct, no evidentiary hearing was necessary since these claims are waived.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found that the district court properly rejected the instant petition based upon the papers filed and the prior proceedings, we need not discuss in detail appellant's claim that he was entitled to summary judgment in his favor.  We observe, however, that any failure by the government to adequately respond to appellant's filings does not, as he suggests, automatically entitle him to relief.  Cf. Jaroma v. Massey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521954\"><a href=\"/opinion/521954/alexander-jaroma-v-james-j-massey-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir. 1989) (stating that the district court cannot grant a motion for summary judgment merely for lack of any response by the opposing party).  In so observing, we express no opinion on whether the government's response was adequate or inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have carefully considered appellant's remaining arguments and reject them as without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although a trial judge might refuse to entertain the prosecution if it found that defense testimony had been thwarted by prosecutorial misconduct, see United States v. De La Cruz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610551\"><a href=\"/opinion/610551/united-states-v-efrain-de-la-cruz-united-states-v-luis-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1307</span></a></span>, 1313 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span> </span>(1993), there would have been, in this case, no apparent basis to urge such a finding</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In one of the exhibits filed below, appellant states that he employed Attorney Singal between June and August 1988.  Most of the acts charged in the indictment occurred during 1987 and the first half of 1988</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We add that trial counsel's advice against proceeding with Senator Hartke as a witness appears to have been a strategic decision.  Hartke had indicated that he would \"bury\" appellant if called to testify</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> For the same reasons, we think that the district appropriately denied appellant's request to expand the record to include these documents</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
