Nathaniel M.

Craveiro, Jr. on brief pro se.\n                       \nScott  Harshbarger,  Attorney General,  and  Eleanor Coe  Sinnott,\n                                                                 \nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellees.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per Curiam.  Appellant Joseph Craveiro appeals from\n                    \n\nthe  district court's order  dismissing his 42  U.S.C.   1983\n\ncomplaint as frivolous  under 28  U.S.C.   1915(d).   Upon  a\n\ncareful review  of the  record  and the  parties' briefs,  we\n\nagree with the judgment of the district court for essentially\n\nthe  reasons stated in its Memorandum  and Order dated August\n\n3, 1993.  We add the following comments.\n\n          First,  appellant's request for  an order directing\n\ndefendants to  correct the state judgment is barred by Rooker\n                                                             \n\nv.  Fidelity  Trust  Co., 263  U.S.  413,  416 (1923)  (lower\n                        \n\nfederal court has no  jurisdiction to sit in review  of state\n\ncourt  judgment).   Second, a  federal court  cannot instruct\n\nstate  officials   how  to  behave  based   upon  state  law.\n                                                       \n\nPennhurst State School &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 106\n                                           \n\n(1984).    These  cases  dispose of  appellant's  claims  for\n\ndeclaratory and  injunctive relief.   Finally, a  judgment in\n\nfavor  of appellant in this case plainly would imply that his\n\nconviction for armed robbery is invalid.  Thus, his claim for\n\ndamages  is not  cognizable  under     1983.    See  Heck  v.\n                                                         \n\nHumphrey, 114 S. Ct. 2364, 2372 (1994).\n        \n\n          Appellant's    complaint,    being   premised    on\n\n\"indisputably  meritless  legal  theor[ies],\"   is  therefore\n\nfrivolous within the meaning of Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n319,  327  (1989).   The judgment  of  the district  court is\n\naffirmed.\n        \n",
