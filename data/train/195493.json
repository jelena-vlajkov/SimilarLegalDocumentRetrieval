In  this   interlocutory  appeal,\n                      \n\nplaintiff-appellant  Todd  G. Ducharme  (\"Ducharme\") contends\n\nthat  the  district court  erred  in  refusing to  approve  a\n\nconsent judgment  in settlement  of  Ducharme's civil  rights\n\naction  against the  Rhode  Island Division  of State  Police\n\n(\"State  Police\") and  Raymond  A.  Driscoll (\"Driscoll\"),  a\n\nmember of  the State Police.   Alternatively, Ducharme argues\n\nthat the district court  exceeded its authority in preventing\n\nthe  parties from  entering  the proposed  consent decree  on\n\ntheir  own  in the  guise of  an  accepted offer  of judgment\n\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          On  July 23,  1991,  Ducharme was  arrested by  the\n\nState Police and charged with disorderly conduct.  The charge\n\nwas  based on Ducharme's  \"abusive and  belligerent\" behavior\n\ntoward a lifeguard who had  requested Ducharme to remove  his\n\ndog from  Beach Pond, a state-run facility located in Exeter,\n\nRhode Island.  Clad only in \"swim trunks,\" Ducharme was taken\n\nto  a  police building  and  strip  searched.   Specifically,\n\ndefendant Driscoll commanded Ducharme to pull his swim trunks\n\ndown to his knees, pull them up again, and then take them off\n\nso that Driscoll could search the pockets of the swim trunks.\n\nDriscoll  then   returned  the  swim   trunks  to   Ducharme.\n\nAccording to State  Police Superintendent Edmond  S. Culhane,\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nJr., Ducharme was  strip searched  because it  \"is a  routine\n\nprocedure  performed  prior to  placing  an  individual in  a\n\nholding cell.\"  We assume that  Ducharme was then placed in a\n\nholding  cell  and that  the  disorderly  conduct charge  was\n\nresolved in some fashion.\n\n          Ducharme  later filed  this  action  in the  United\n\nStates  District  Court  for  the District  of  Rhode  Island\n\nagainst  the  State  Police  and Driscoll.1    The  complaint\n\nalleges,  inter alia,  that  the strip  search constituted  a\n                    \n\nviolation  of Ducharme's  right  to be  free of  unreasonable\n\nsearches and  seizures pursuant to the  Fourth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments to the Constitution,  actionable under 42 U.S.C.  \n\n1983.\n\n          The   complaint   contains   specific   allegations\n\nconcerning the unreasonableness of an  automatic strip search\n\npolicy.  The complaint  asserts that \"it is well  settled law\n\nthat mandatory strip searches of arrestees charged with minor\n\noffenses, absent a reasonable  suspicion that the arrestee is\n\nconcealing weapons  or contraband, such as  that performed on\n\n[Ducharme],  are unconstitutional.\"   As  additional evidence\n\nthat an  automatic strip  search policy is  unreasonable, the\n\ncomplaint reports that Rhode Island's Attorney General issued\n\nthe following advice to the State Police in 1985:\n\n                    \n\n1.  The complaint  names Driscoll in both  his individual and\nofficial capacities.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          The strip searching  of persons  detained\n          for  a  short  period of  time  for petty\n          offenses  should not  be undertaken  as a\n          matter of routine procedure.  The persons\n          arrested for petty offenses should not be\n          strip searched unless  there is  probable\n          cause  to  believe  that  the  person  is\n          concealing a weapon, drugs or evidence of\n          a crime.\n\n          Ducharme  also alleged  that  he  might again  fall\n\nvictim to  defendants' strip  search policy.   In particular,\n\nDucharme alleged that he\n\n          resides in  close proximity to  the State\n          of Rhode Island and  has and continues to\n          travel  to and  frequent  places  in  the\n          State  of Rhode  Island, as  a result  of\n          which,  he has [been] and continues to be\n          exposed  to  the  possibility of  further\n          invasion  of  his privacy  by Defendants'\n          policy   of  routinely   strip  searching\n          arrestees for minor offenses, even in the\n          absence of reasonable grounds  to justify\n          such a search.\n\n          In addition to  requesting compensatory damages and\n\nattorney's  fees,  Ducharme  also  sought  several  forms  of\n\nequitable  relief:    (1)  a declaratory  judgment  that  the\n\nautomatic  strip  search  policy   of  the  State  Police  is\n\nunconstitutional; (2) a declaratory judgment that defendants'\n\nstrip  search of  Ducharme was  unconstitutional; and  (3) an\n\ninjunction  preventing  \"[d]efendants  from  routinely  strip\n\nsearching [Ducharme] and all other persons arrested for minor\n\noffenses,  absent reasonable suspicion  that the  arrestee is\n\nconcealing a weapon or contraband.\" \n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          Prior   to  the   filing  of   an  answer   or  the\n\ncommencement of  discovery, the parties began  to negotiate a\n\nsettlement.   In February 1993,  defendants made an  offer of\n\njudgment  pursuant  to  Rule  682  in  the  amount  of $7500.\n\nDucharme  rejected the  offer, explaining  that he  would not\n\nsettle without a promise  on the part of the  defendants that\n\nthey  would no  longer conduct  unreasonable strip  searches.\n\nDefendants responded  by proposing, in addition  to the money\n\njudgment, a  letter to  Ducharme reportedly stating  that the\n\npolicy of the  State Police  was now in  conformity with  the\n\nAttorney  General's  1985  letter.3    Once  again,  Ducharme\n\nrefused. \n\n          Sometime  thereafter  the   parties  agreed  on   a\n\nproposed consent judgment, presented to the district court in\n\n                    \n\n2.  In pertinent part, Fed R. Civ. P. 68 provides:\n\n          At any time more  than 10 days before the\n          trial begins, a party defending against a\n          claim may serve upon the adverse party an\n          offer  to  allow  judgment  to  be  taken\n          against the defending party for the money\n          or property or to the effect specified in\n          the offer, with  costs then accrued.   If\n          within 10 days after  the service of  the\n          offer  the  adverse party  serves written\n          notice that the offer is accepted, either\n          party may then file the offer and  notice\n          of  acceptance  together  with  proof  of\n          service thereof and  thereupon the  clerk\n          shall enter judgment.\n\n3.  This is our understanding of statements made by the State\nat  oral argument  before this  court.   The letter  does not\nappear in the record on appeal.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nApril  1993,  that would  award Ducharme  $7500 and  bind the\n\ndefendants with the following prospective provision:\n\n          Defendants shall not  require as a matter\n          of  policy,  nor  shall  they  perform or\n          cause to be  performed strip searches  of\n          arrestees  charged  with  misdemeanor  or\n          motor   vehicle    offenses,   absent   a\n          reasonable suspicion that an  arrestee is\n          concealing  a  weapon or  contraband, and\n          shall   otherwise  conduct   searches  of\n          arrestees within  the limitations imposed\n          by law.\n\nIn  an  unrecorded  chambers conference,  the  district court\n\napparently  expressed its  concern that  the proposed  decree\n\nwould saddle  the court with  the task  of supervising  strip\n\nsearches  conducted by  the State  Police and  on  that basis\n\nrefused to approve the judgment.\n\n          With  this  avenue  closed, the  parties  developed\n\nanother solution.   Defendants  orally agreed to  amend their\n\nRule  68  offer  of judgment  to  include  the  terms of  the\n\nproposed consent decree.   Because Rhode Island law prohibits\n\nthe State from  settling a  case without some  form of  court\n\napproval, see  R.I. Gen. Laws     9-31-6 and  9-31-10 (1985),\n             \n\nthe parties gave the district judge an opportunity  to object\n\nby notifying him  of their intentions.  In another unrecorded\n\nchambers conference, the district court evidently stated that\n\nit  had  the discretion  to prevent  the  entry of  a consent\n\njudgment even if  the judgment was offered in  the form of an\n\notherwise nondiscretionary, self-executing Rule 68  offer and\n\nacceptance.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          Finally, Ducharme filed  a self-styled \"Motion  for\n\nEntry of Consent Judgment or in the Alternative Withdrawal of\n\nthe Court's Interference With the Entry of Judgment by Way of\n\na  Rule 68 Offer and  Acceptance Thereof.\"   In the meantime,\n\nthe parties amended the  proposed consent judgment to specify\n\nthat it could  only be  enforced by Ducharme.   The  district\n\ncourt  conducted   a  hearing   in  June  1993,   and,  after\n\nconsidering the parties' arguments, denied  Ducharme's motion\n\nfrom the bench.  This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                         JURISDICTION\n                                     \n\n          Two important jurisdictional issues prevent us from\n\naddressing  the merits  of  this appeal.   First,  Ducharme's\n\nclaims for  equitable relief do  not fall within  the subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction  of the federal  courts.  Second,  to the\n\nextent that the prospective  relief contained in the proposed\n\nconsent judgment does not amount to an injunction, we have no\n\nappellate  jurisdiction  to  consider  the  district  court's\n\ninterlocutory  refusal  to   approve  the  proposed   consent\n\njudgment.  We discuss each jurisdictional issue in turn.\n\nA.  Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n                               \n\n          Article III of the Constitution outlines the limits\n\nof our  mandate; federal jurisdiction extends  only to actual\n\n\"Cases [or] Controversies.\"  A federal court is  powerless to\n\nanswer   hypothetical  legal   questions  or   legislate  the\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nresolution  of  future problems.    Nor may  a  federal court\n\nintervene  in  an  actual,  ongoing  controversy unless  that\n\ncontroversy is  reduced to  a dispute among  parties lawfully\n\nbefore the court.   Accordingly, to  stand before an  Article\n\nIII court, \"[a] plaintiff  must demonstrate a concrete injury\n\ncaused  by  the defendant  and  remediable  by the  requested\n\nrelief.\"  American  Postal Workers Union  v. Frank, 968  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1373, 1378 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          The  standing inquiry does  not require  an all-or-\n\nnothing analysis,  but may call for  some careful dissection.\n\nA suit may  proceed in federal court even if  some aspects of\n\nthe plaintiff's  requested relief  are not likely  to redress\n\nplaintiff's  injuries.    By   the  same  token,  however,  a\n\nplaintiff who is otherwise properly in federal court may lack\n\nstanding to pursue particular forms of relief.   For example,\n\nwhile  past injury generates standing  to bring an action for\n\ndamages, \"past exposure to  harm will not, in and  of itself,\n\nconfer standing  upon a  litigant to obtain  equitable relief\n\n`[a]bsent a  sufficient likelihood  that [the litigant]  will\n\nagain  be wronged in  a similar way.'\"   Id. at 1376 (quoting\n                                            \n\nCity of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111 (1983)) (first\n                            \n\nbrackets in original).\n\n          In this  case,  Ducharme clearly  has  standing  to\n\nbring  an action for damages against  the defendants based on\n\nthe July 23, 1991, strip search.   It is equally obvious that\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nDucharme  has  no  standing  to   request  equitable  relief.\n\nAccording to  Ducharme, the routine strip  search policy only\n\napplied  to arrestees about to  be placed in  a holding cell.\n\nWe simply cannot assume that Ducharme will violate the law in\n\nthe future in  a manner that would  lead the State  Police to\n\narrest him and place him  in a holding cell.  And,  as far as\n\nthe record reveals, Ducharme is not in a State Police holding\n\ncell now, nor is he  about to be placed in one.   Finally, it\n\nappears that even in  the event of a future  arrest, Ducharme\n\nis unlikely to be  subject to an unconstitutional  search if,\n\nas the State  represented at oral argument, the  State Police\n\nstrip search policy now conforms to the prospective provision\n\nof the proposed consent judgment.   In the absence of  a case\n\nor controversy with respect to Ducharme's claim for equitable\n\nrelief, Lyons teaches that neither we nor the  district court\n             \n\nhave  jurisdiction to  consider  the merits  of an  equitable\n\ndecree.  Nor do we perceive any reason why the outcome of the\n\njurisdictional inquiry  should turn on whether  the decree is\n\nthe product of a  pre-trial consent judgment or  a post-trial\n\norder.\n\n          We hasten to add that  the peculiarities of Rule 68\n\ndo   not  require   a  court  to   postpone  ruling   on  the\n\njurisdictional  basis of  the  judgment the  parties seek  to\n\nenter.  We acknowledge that Rule 68 requires the clerk of the\n\ndistrict court to enter  the parties' agreed-upon judgment in\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\na ministerial fashion.   See  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 68  (providing\n                            \n\nthat  \"the clerk shall enter judgment\" according to the terms\n                      \n\nof a  timely accepted offer) (emphasis  added); see generally\n                                                             \n\nMallory v. Eyrich, 922 F.2d 1273, 1279 (6th Cir. 1991) (\"Rule\n                 \n\n68  . . .  leaves no discretion  in the district  court to do\n\nanything  but   enter  judgment   once  an  offer   has  been\n\naccepted.\")     Accordingly,  a  district  court   would  not\n\nordinarily have an opportunity to question the jurisdictional\n\nbasis for an injunction  embodied in the judgment until  some\n\nlater  time,  such as  when one  party  seeks to  enforce the\n\ninjunction.    But   Rule  68  cannot  require  entry   of  a\n\njurisdictionally  defective judgment  when the  parties bring\n\nthat judgment to the attention of the court.\n\n          Our conclusion as to the claim for equitable relief\n\ndoes  not  necessarily imply,  however,  that  subject matter\n\njurisdiction  is now entirely absent.   As we have mentioned,\n\nDucharme  still has  standing  to pursue  his damages  claim.\n\nConsequently,  Ducharme still  has  the right  to settle  his\n\ndamages claim by way  of an agreement that  does not ask  the\n\ncourt to ignore its jurisdictional limitations.  And, because\n\nneither the proposed consent judgment nor defendants' amended\n\nRule 68  offer of judgment are on  their terms \"injunctions,\"\n\nthe parties may simply have been seeking the district court's\n\napproval of a private contract containing a promise governing\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\ndefendants' future behavior.   With the issues thus narrowed,\n\nwe now turn to the matter of appellate jurisdiction.\n\nB.  Appellate Jurisdiction\n                          \n\n          Ducharme  concedes that his appeal does not concern\n\na \"final decision[]\" appealable  under 28 U.S.C. 1291 (1988),\n\nbut  correctly observes that we are authorized by 28 U.S.C.  \n\n1292(a)(1)  (1988) to  hear an  appeal from  \"[i]nterlocutory\n\norders  of  the  district  courts  .  .  .  refusing  .  .  .\n\ninjunctions.\"   The  Supreme  Court has  held  that an  order\n\nrefusing to approve a consent judgment containing  injunctive\n\nrelief   has  the  \"practical  effect\"  of  a  denial  of  an\n\ninjunction and  is therefore  appealable pursuant to  Section\n\n1292(a)(1).  Carson  v. American Brands,  Inc., 450 U.S.  79,\n                                              \n\n83-84  (1981); Durrett  v. Housing  Auth. of  Providence, 896\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 600, 602 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n          We have  already concluded that neither  we nor the\n\ndistrict court have jurisdiction to consider the  entry of an\n\nactual injunction.

Ducharme (\"Ducharme\") contends that the district court erred in refusing to approve a consent judgment in settlement of Ducharme's civil rights action against the Rhode Island Division of State Police (\"State Police\") and Raymond A. Driscoll (\"Driscoll\"), a member of the State Police.  Alternatively, Ducharme argues that the district court exceeded its authority in preventing the parties from entering the proposed consent decree on their own in the guise of an accepted offer of judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 23, 1991, Ducharme was arrested by the State Police and charged with disorderly conduct.  The charge was based on Ducharme's \"abusive and belligerent\" behavior toward a lifeguard who had requested Ducharme to remove his dog from Beach Pond, a state-run facility located in Exeter, Rhode Island.  Clad only in \"swim trunks,\" Ducharme was taken to a police building and strip searched.  Specifically, defendant Driscoll commanded Ducharme to pull his swim trunks down to his knees, pull them up again, and then take them off so that Driscoll could search the pockets of the swim trunks.  Driscoll then returned the swim trunks to Ducharme.  According to State Police Superintendent Edmond S. Culhane, Jr., Ducharme was strip searched because it \"is a routine procedure performed prior to placing an individual in a holding cell.\"  We assume that Ducharme was then placed in a holding cell and that the disorderly conduct charge was resolved in some fashion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ducharme later filed this action in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the State Police and Driscoll.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The complaint alleges, inter alia, that the strip search constituted a violation of Ducharme's right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures pursuant to the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution, actionable under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint contains specific allegations concerning the unreasonableness of an automatic strip search policy.  The complaint asserts that \"it is well settled law that mandatory strip searches of arrestees charged with minor offenses, absent a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing weapons or contraband, such as that performed on [Ducharme], are unconstitutional.\"  As additional evidence that an automatic strip search policy is unreasonable, the complaint reports that Rhode Island's Attorney General issued the following advice to the State Police in 1985:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The strip searching of persons detained for a short period of time for petty offenses should not be undertaken as a matter of routine procedure.  The persons arrested for petty offenses should not be strip searched unless there is probable cause to believe that the person is concealing a weapon, drugs or evidence of a crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ducharme also alleged that he might again fall victim to defendants' strip search policy.  In particular, Ducharme alleged that he</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">resides in close proximity to the State of Rhode Island and has and continues to travel to and frequent places in the State of Rhode Island, as a result of which, he has [been] and continues to be exposed to the possibility of further invasion of his privacy by Defendants' policy of routinely strip searching arrestees for minor offenses, even in the absence of reasonable grounds to justify such a search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to requesting compensatory damages and attorney's fees, Ducharme also sought several forms of equitable relief:  (1) a declaratory judgment that the automatic strip search policy of the State Police is unconstitutional;  (2) a declaratory judgment that defendants' strip search of Ducharme was unconstitutional;  and (3) an injunction preventing \"[d]efendants from routinely strip searching [Ducharme] and all other persons arrested for minor offenses, absent reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the filing of an answer or the commencement of discovery, the parties began to negotiate a settlement.  In February 1993, defendants made an offer of judgment pursuant to Rule 68<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> in the amount of $7500.  Ducharme rejected the offer, explaining that he would not settle without a promise on the part of the defendants that they would no longer conduct unreasonable strip searches.  Defendants responded by proposing, in addition to the money judgment, a letter to Ducharme reportedly stating that the policy of the State Police was now in conformity with the Attorney General's 1985 letter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Once again, Ducharme refused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime thereafter the parties agreed on a proposed consent judgment, presented to the district court in April 1993, that would award Ducharme $7500 and bind the defendants with the following prospective provision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants shall not require as a matter of policy, nor shall they perform or cause to be performed strip searches of arrestees charged with misdemeanor or motor vehicle offenses, absent a reasonable suspicion that an arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband, and shall otherwise conduct searches of arrestees within the limitations imposed by law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an unrecorded chambers conference, the district court apparently expressed its concern that the proposed decree would saddle the court with the task of supervising strip searches conducted by the State Police and on that basis refused to approve the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this avenue closed, the parties developed another solution.  Defendants orally agreed to amend their Rule 68 offer of judgment to include the terms of the proposed consent decree.  Because Rhode Island law prohibits the State from settling a case without some form of court approval, see R.I. Gen. Laws Secs. 9-31-6 and 9-31-10 (1985), the parties gave the district judge an opportunity to object by notifying him of their intentions.  In another unrecorded chambers conference, the district court evidently stated that it had the discretion to prevent the entry of a consent judgment even if the judgment was offered in the form of an otherwise nondiscretionary, self- executing Rule 68 offer and acceptance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Ducharme filed a self-styled \"Motion for Entry of Consent Judgment or in the Alternative Withdrawal of the Court's Interference With the Entry of Judgment by Way of a Rule 68 Offer and Acceptance Thereof.\"  In the meantime, the parties amended the proposed consent judgment to specify that it could only be enforced by Ducharme.  The district court conducted a hearing in June 1993, and, after considering the parties' arguments, denied Ducharme's motion from the bench.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two important jurisdictional issues prevent us from addressing the merits of this appeal.  First, Ducharme's claims for equitable relief do not fall within the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts.  Second, to the extent that the prospective relief contained in the proposed consent judgment does not amount to an injunction, we have no appellate jurisdiction to consider the district court's interlocutory refusal to approve the proposed consent judgment.  We discuss each jurisdictional issue in turn.  A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article III of the Constitution outlines the limits of our mandate;  federal jurisdiction extends only to actual \"Cases [or] Controversies.\"  A federal court is powerless to answer hypothetical legal questions or legislate the resolution of future problems.  Nor may a federal court intervene in an actual, ongoing controversy unless that controversy is reduced to a dispute among parties lawfully before the court.  Accordingly, to stand before an Article III court, \"[a] plaintiff must demonstrate a concrete injury caused by the defendant and remediable by the requested relief.\"   American Postal Workers Union v. Frank, 968 F.2d 1373, 1378 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standing inquiry does not require an all-or- nothing analysis, but may call for some careful dissection.  A suit may proceed in federal court even if some aspects of the plaintiff's requested relief are not likely to redress plaintiff's injuries.  By the same token, however, a plaintiff who is otherwise properly in federal court may lack standing to pursue particular forms of relief.  For example, while past injury generates standing to bring an action for damages, \"past exposure to harm will not, in and of itself, confer standing upon a litigant to obtain equitable relief '[a]bsent a sufficient likelihood that [the litigant] will again be wronged in a similar way.' \"   Id. at 1376 (quoting  City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111 (1983)) (first brackets in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Ducharme clearly has standing to bring an action for damages against the defendants based on the July 23, 1991, strip search.  It is equally obvious that Ducharme has no standing to request equitable relief.  According to Ducharme, the routine strip search policy only applied to arrestees about to be placed in a holding cell.  We simply cannot assume that Ducharme will violate the law in the future in a manner that would lead the State Police to arrest him and place him in a holding cell.  And, as far as the record reveals, Ducharme is not in a State Police holding cell now, nor is he about to be placed in one.  Finally, it appears that even in the event of a future arrest, Ducharme is unlikely to be subject to an unconstitutional search if, as the State represented at oral argument, the State Police strip search policy now conforms to the prospective provision of the proposed consent judgment.  In the absence of a case or controversy with respect to Ducharme's claim for equitable relief, Lyons teaches that neither we nor the district court have jurisdiction to consider the merits of an equitable decree.  Nor do we perceive any reason why the outcome of the jurisdictional inquiry should turn on whether the decree is the product of a pre-trial consent judgment or a post-trial order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hasten to add that the peculiarities of Rule 68 do not require a court to postpone ruling on the jurisdictional basis of the judgment the parties seek to enter.  We acknowledge that Rule 68 requires the clerk of the district court to enter the parties' agreed-upon judgment in a ministerial fashion.  See Fed.  R. Civ. P. 68 (providing that \"the clerk shall enter judgment\" according to the terms of a timely accepted offer) (emphasis added);   see generally Mallory v. Eyrich, 922 F.2d 1273, 1279 (6th Cir. 1991) (\"Rule 68 ... leaves no discretion in the district court to do anything but enter judgment once an offer has been accepted.\")  Accordingly, a district court would not ordinarily have an opportunity to question the jurisdictional basis for an injunction embodied in the judgment until some later time, such as when one party seeks to enforce the injunction.  But Rule 68 cannot require entry of a jurisdictionally defective judgment when the parties bring that judgment to the attention of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion as to the claim for equitable relief does not necessarily imply, however, that subject matter jurisdiction is now entirely absent.  As we have mentioned, Ducharme still has standing to pursue his damages claim.  Consequently, Ducharme still has the right to settle his damages claim by way of an agreement that does not ask the court to ignore its jurisdictional limitations.  And, because neither the proposed consent judgment nor defendants' amended Rule 68 offer of judgment are on their terms \"injunctions,\" the parties may simply have been seeking the district court's approval of a private contract containing a promise governing defendants' future behavior.  With the issues thus narrowed, we now turn to the matter of appellate jurisdiction.  B. Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ducharme concedes that his appeal does not concern a \"final decision[ ]\" appealable under 28 U.S.C. 1291 (1988), but correctly observes that we are authorized by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a)(1) (1988) to hear an appeal from \"[i]nterlocutory orders of the district courts ... refusing ... injunctions.\"  The Supreme Court has held that an order refusing to approve a consent judgment containing injunctive relief has the \"practical effect\" of a denial of an injunction and is therefore appealable pursuant to Section 1292(a)(1).   Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 83-84 (1981);   Durrett v. Housing Auth. of Providence, 896 F.2d 600, 602 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have already concluded that neither we nor the district court have jurisdiction to consider the entry of an actual injunction.  Thus, we need only determine whether we have jurisdiction to review a district court's refusal to approve a consent judgment containing non-injunctive yet forward-looking contractual relief.  Plainly, we do not.  Even if a simple contractual promise is nearly as valuable to a plaintiff as an actual injunction, such a promise is not the equivalent of an injunction and therefore a district court's refusal to approve such a promise does not constitute the denial of an \"injunction\" within the meaning of Section 1292(a)(1).  Moreover, to the extent that the prospective provision of the settlement agreement in this case is amenable to interpretation as an \"injunction,\" appellate jurisdiction would be meaningless because there is no jurisdiction in the district court for the issuance of such an injunction.  In short, Ducharme has offered no valid basis for the exercise of appellate jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the jurisdictional defect outlined above, the district court's order denying plaintiff's motion is vacated, and the cause is remanded for dismissal of plaintiff's claim for equitable relief for lack of jurisdiction.  Any further action necessary to resolve plaintiff's damages claim shall proceed in harmony with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The complaint names Driscoll in both his individual and official capacities</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In pertinent part, Fed R.

If within 10 days after the service of the offer the adverse party serves written notice that the offer is accepted, either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance together with proof of service thereof and thereupon the clerk shall enter judgment.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This is our understanding of statements made by the State at oral argument before this court.

The complaint asserts that \"it is well settled law that mandatory strip searches of arrestees charged with minor offenses, absent a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing weapons or contraband, such as that performed on [Ducharme], are unconstitutional.\"  As additional evidence that an automatic strip search policy is unreasonable, the complaint reports that Rhode Island's Attorney General issued the following advice to the State Police in 1985:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The strip searching of persons detained for a short period of time for petty offenses should not be undertaken as a matter of routine procedure.  The persons arrested for petty offenses should not be strip searched unless there is probable cause to believe that the person is concealing a weapon, drugs or evidence of a crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ducharme also alleged that he might again fall victim to defendants' strip search policy.  In particular, Ducharme alleged that he</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">resides in close proximity to the State of Rhode Island and has and continues to travel to and frequent places in the State of Rhode Island, as a result of which, he has [been] and continues to be exposed to the possibility of further invasion of his privacy by Defendants' policy of routinely strip searching arrestees for minor offenses, even in the absence of reasonable grounds to justify such a search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to requesting compensatory damages and attorney's fees, Ducharme also sought several forms of equitable relief:  (1) a declaratory judgment that the automatic strip search policy of the State Police is unconstitutional;  (2) a declaratory judgment that defendants' strip search of Ducharme was unconstitutional;  and (3) an injunction preventing \"[d]efendants from routinely strip searching [Ducharme] and all other persons arrested for minor offenses, absent reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the filing of an answer or the commencement of discovery, the parties began to negotiate a settlement.  In February 1993, defendants made an offer of judgment pursuant to Rule 68<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> in the amount of $7500.  Ducharme rejected the offer, explaining that he would not settle without a promise on the part of the defendants that they would no longer conduct unreasonable strip searches.  Defendants responded by proposing, in addition to the money judgment, a letter to Ducharme reportedly stating that the policy of the State Police was now in conformity with the Attorney General's 1985 letter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Once again, Ducharme refused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime thereafter the parties agreed on a proposed consent judgment, presented to the district court in April 1993, that would award Ducharme $7500 and bind the defendants with the following prospective provision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants shall not require as a matter of policy, nor shall they perform or cause to be performed strip searches of arrestees charged with misdemeanor or motor vehicle offenses, absent a reasonable suspicion that an arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband, and shall otherwise conduct searches of arrestees within the limitations imposed by law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an unrecorded chambers conference, the district court apparently expressed its concern that the proposed decree would saddle the court with the task of supervising strip searches conducted by the State Police and on that basis refused to approve the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this avenue closed, the parties developed another solution.  Defendants orally agreed to amend their Rule 68 offer of judgment to include the terms of the proposed consent decree.  Because Rhode Island law prohibits the State from settling a case without some form of court approval, see R.I. Gen. Laws Secs. 9-31-6 and 9-31-10 (1985), the parties gave the district judge an opportunity to object by notifying him of their intentions.  In another unrecorded chambers conference, the district court evidently stated that it had the discretion to prevent the entry of a consent judgment even if the judgment was offered in the form of an otherwise nondiscretionary, self- executing Rule 68 offer and acceptance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Ducharme filed a self-styled \"Motion for Entry of Consent Judgment or in the Alternative Withdrawal of the Court's Interference With the Entry of Judgment by Way of a Rule 68 Offer and Acceptance Thereof.\"  In the meantime, the parties amended the proposed consent judgment to specify that it could only be enforced by Ducharme.  The district court conducted a hearing in June 1993, and, after considering the parties' arguments, denied Ducharme's motion from the bench.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two important jurisdictional issues prevent us from addressing the merits of this appeal.  First, Ducharme's claims for equitable relief do not fall within the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts.  Second, to the extent that the prospective relief contained in the proposed consent judgment does not amount to an injunction, we have no appellate jurisdiction to consider the district court's interlocutory refusal to approve the proposed consent judgment.  We discuss each jurisdictional issue in turn.  A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article III of the Constitution outlines the limits of our mandate;  federal jurisdiction extends only to actual \"Cases [or] Controversies.\"  A federal court is powerless to answer hypothetical legal questions or legislate the resolution of future problems.  Nor may a federal court intervene in an actual, ongoing controversy unless that controversy is reduced to a dispute among parties lawfully before the court.  Accordingly, to stand before an Article III court, \"[a] plaintiff must demonstrate a concrete injury caused by the defendant and remediable by the requested relief.\"   American Postal Workers Union v. Frank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586809\"><a href=\"/opinion/586809/american-postal-workers-union-v-anthony-m-frank/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1373</span></a></span>, 1378 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standing inquiry does not require an all-or- nothing analysis, but may call for some careful dissection.  A suit may proceed in federal court even if some aspects of the plaintiff's requested relief are not likely to redress plaintiff's injuries.  By the same token, however, a plaintiff who is otherwise properly in federal court may lack standing to pursue particular forms of relief.  For example, while past injury generates standing to bring an action for damages, \"past exposure to harm will not, in and of itself, confer standing upon a litigant to obtain equitable relief '[a]bsent a sufficient likelihood that [the litigant] will again be wronged in a similar way.' \"   <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586809\"><a href=\"/opinion/586809/american-postal-workers-union-v-anthony-m-frank/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1376 </a></span>(quoting  City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110916\"><a href=\"/opinion/110916/los-angeles-v-lyons/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span>, 111 (1983)) (first brackets in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Ducharme clearly has standing to bring an action for damages against the defendants based on the July 23, 1991, strip search.  It is equally obvious that Ducharme has no standing to request equitable relief.  According to Ducharme, the routine strip search policy only applied to arrestees about to be placed in a holding cell.  We simply cannot assume that Ducharme will violate the law in the future in a manner that would lead the State Police to arrest him and place him in a holding cell.  And, as far as the record reveals, Ducharme is not in a State Police holding cell now, nor is he about to be placed in one.  Finally, it appears that even in the event of a future arrest, Ducharme is unlikely to be subject to an unconstitutional search if, as the State represented at oral argument, the State Police strip search policy now conforms to the prospective provision of the proposed consent judgment.  In the absence of a case or controversy with respect to Ducharme's claim for equitable relief, Lyons teaches that neither we nor the district court have jurisdiction to consider the merits of an equitable decree.  Nor do we perceive any reason why the outcome of the jurisdictional inquiry should turn on whether the decree is the product of a pre-trial consent judgment or a post-trial order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hasten to add that the peculiarities of Rule 68 do not require a court to postpone ruling on the jurisdictional basis of the judgment the parties seek to enter.  We acknowledge that Rule 68 requires the clerk of the district court to enter the parties' agreed-upon judgment in a ministerial fashion.  See Fed.  R. Civ. P. 68 (providing that \"the clerk shall enter judgment\" according to the terms of a timely accepted offer) (emphasis added);   see generally Mallory v. Eyrich, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553871\"><a href=\"/opinion/553871/william-mallory-arthur-primus-vera-johnson-charles-collins-ii-mary-ann/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1273</span></a></span>, 1279 (6th Cir. 1991) (\"Rule 68 ... leaves no discretion in the district court to do anything but enter judgment once an offer has been accepted.\")  Accordingly, a district court would not ordinarily have an opportunity to question the jurisdictional basis for an injunction embodied in the judgment until some later time, such as when one party seeks to enforce the injunction.  But Rule 68 cannot require entry of a jurisdictionally defective judgment when the parties bring that judgment to the attention of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion as to the claim for equitable relief does not necessarily imply, however, that subject matter jurisdiction is now entirely absent.  As we have mentioned, Ducharme still has standing to pursue his damages claim.  Consequently, Ducharme still has the right to settle his damages claim by way of an agreement that does not ask the court to ignore its jurisdictional limitations.  And, because neither the proposed consent judgment nor defendants' amended Rule 68 offer of judgment are on their terms \"injunctions,\" the parties may simply have been seeking the district court's approval of a private contract containing a promise governing defendants' future behavior.  With the issues thus narrowed, we now turn to the matter of appellate jurisdiction.  B. Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ducharme concedes that his appeal does not concern a \"final decision[ ]\" appealable under 28 U.S.C. 1291 (1988), but correctly observes that we are authorized by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a)(1) (1988) to hear an appeal from \"[i]nterlocutory orders of the district courts ... refusing ... injunctions.\"  The Supreme Court has held that an order refusing to approve a consent judgment containing injunctive relief has the \"practical effect\" of a denial of an injunction and is therefore appealable pursuant to Section 1292(a)(1).   Carson v. American Brands, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110416\"><a href=\"/opinion/110416/carson-v-american-brands-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 83-84 (1981);   Durrett v. Housing Auth. of Providence, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536971\"><a href=\"/opinion/536971/ruth-durrett-v-housing-authority-of-the-city-of-providence/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span>, 602 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have already concluded that neither we nor the district court have jurisdiction to consider the entry of an actual injunction.  Thus, we need only determine whether we have jurisdiction to review a district court's refusal to approve a consent judgment containing non-injunctive yet forward-looking contractual relief.  Plainly, we do not.  Even if a simple contractual promise is nearly as valuable to a plaintiff as an actual injunction, such a promise is not the equivalent of an injunction and therefore a district court's refusal to approve such a promise does not constitute the denial of an \"injunction\" within the meaning of Section 1292(a)(1).  Moreover, to the extent that the prospective provision of the settlement agreement in this case is amenable to interpretation as an \"injunction,\" appellate jurisdiction would be meaningless because there is no jurisdiction in the district court for the issuance of such an injunction.  In short, Ducharme has offered no valid basis for the exercise of appellate jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the jurisdictional defect outlined above, the district court's order denying plaintiff's motion is vacated, and the cause is remanded for dismissal of plaintiff's claim for equitable relief for lack of jurisdiction.  Any further action necessary to resolve plaintiff's damages claim shall proceed in harmony with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The complaint names Driscoll in both his individual and official capacities</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In pertinent part, Fed R.

If within 10 days after the service of the offer the adverse party serves written notice that the offer is accepted, either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance together with proof of service thereof and thereupon the clerk shall enter judgment.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This is our understanding of statements made by the State at oral argument before this court.
