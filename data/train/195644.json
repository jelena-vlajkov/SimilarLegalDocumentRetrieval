LEAHY,\n\n                     Defendant, Appellee.\n\n                                         \n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n        [Hon. Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n                                         \n\n                            Before\n\n                    Cyr, Boudin and Stahl,\n                       Circuit Judges.\n                                     \n\n                                         \n\nLawrence Curtin on brief pro se.\n               \nScott  Harshbarger,  Attorney General,  and  Rebecca  P. McIntyre,\n                                                                 \nAssistant Attorney General, on Motion for Summary Affirmance.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per Curiam.   Appellant contends he  was denied due\n                    \n\nprocess  in  a  state  court proceeding  because  a  judgment\n\nentered against  him without  service ever having  been made.\n\nAppellant  claims he did not learn of the judgment until long\n\nafter the time  to appeal  had expired, and  the state  court\n\njudge  subsequently refused  during  a  telephone inquiry  to\n\nreopen the case.   Apparently believing  no avenue of  relief\n\nwas available within the  state court system, appellant filed\n\nthe present civil rights action against the state court judge\n\nand  asked  the federal  court to  enjoin enforcement  of the\n\nstate   court  judgment.     The  district   court  dismissed\n\nappellant's action.\n\n          We  affirm  the  dismissal  because  appellant  has\n\nfailed  to  state a  claim  for  deprivation of  due  process\n\ncognizable  under    1983.   Appellant  has not  attacked the\n\nconstitutionality or sufficiency of  Massachusetts procedures\n\nfor  service  or  setting   aside  judgments.    Rather,  his\n\ncomplaint is that these procedures were, or will be, misused.\n\nMassachusetts,  however, affords  a procedure  for correcting\n\nerrors of the sort  alleged through a motion for  relief from\n\njudgment,  Mass. R. Dom. Rel.  P. 60(b), and  an appeal, were\n\nsuch a  motion denied.  Massachusetts  therefore provides its\n\nlitigants due  process.  See  McCulloch v. County  of Washoe,\n                                                            \n\n720  F.2d 1020, 1021 (9th  Cir. 1983) (even  if plaintiff was\n\nnever served  with process  and state court  default judgment\n\nentered  improperly,  state procedure  for  vacating judgment\n\naffords adequate due process; consequently,  plaintiff failed\n\nto state a claim for relief under   1983). \n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -3-\n",
