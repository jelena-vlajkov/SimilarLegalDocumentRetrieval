Papps, First Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r                           \nPaul M. Gagnon, United States Attorney,  was on briefs for the  United\r                      \nStates.\nCharles  S.  Temple,  by  Appointment  of  the  Court,  with  whom\r                               \nUpshall, Cooper &amp; Temple, P.A. was on brief for appellee.\r                                      \n\n                                         \n\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per  Curiam.  On January 26, 1990, a jury convicted Gary\r                            \n\nWlodyka of possession with intent to distribute marijuana and\n\ncocaine.  21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1).  At sentencing, the district\n\njudge concluded that the defendant had an offense level of 32\n\nand a criminal history category  of 6, generating a guideline\n\nrange  of 210 to 262  months.  Departing  downward, the court\n\nsentenced defendant to 168 months' imprisonment.\n\n     The  grounds  for  the  departure included  a  harrowing\n\nchildhood, involving  the  suicide of  one parent,  attempted\n\nsuicide by another, a stint in an orphanage, and finally rape\n\nby an alcoholic stepfather  and continued physical and sexual\n\nabuse; service in the Marine  Corps in Vietnam and subsequent\n\naddiction to drugs (derived in part from treatment for injury\n\nwhile  in service)  and  later  treatment for  post-traumatic\n\nstress disorder;  and present  infection with the  HIV virus.\n\nIn the  sentencing memorandum,  the court noted:   \"overkill,\n\nlife sentence,  defendant dying from  AIDS, Vietnam  veteran,\n\ndrug addicted.\"  \n\n     On June 18,  1990, Wlodyka asked  the district court  to\n\nhave  an  appeal filed  on his  behalf.   The  district court\n\ndenied the  request as  untimely, and  Wlodyka appealed.   On\n\nJune 27,  1990, this court in an  unpublished order sustained\n\nthe  district court's action.  This court declined to pass on\n\nthe  claim that defendant had not been given timely notice of\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nhis right to appeal, noting that relief on this ground should\n\nbe sought under 28 U.S.C.   2255.  \n\n     After an  unsuccessful effort to reduce  his sentence by\n\nmotion under Fed. R. Crim. P. 35, a ruling summarily affirmed\n\nby this court on  appeal, United States v. Wlodyka,  953 F.2d\r                                                              \n\n632  (1st Cir.  1991)  (per curiam),  Wlodyka filed  a motion\n\nunder 28 U.S.C.    2255.  He  argued that the district  court\n\nhad failed at  the time  of sentencing to  advise him of  his\n\nright to appeal, as required by  Fed. R. Crim. P. 32; he also\n\nurged  ineffective assistance  of  counsel at  sentencing,  a\n\nclaim  later rejected  and not  appealed  by Wlodyka.   After\n\nhearings  in late  1993 and  early 1994,  the district  court\n\ndetermined  that it had not complied with Rule 32 and granted\n\nthe defendant a new sentencing hearing.\n\n     On January 20, 1994, a new sentencing hearing  was held.\n\nDefendant presented evidence, addressed  to the events in his\n\nhistory  already  described,  but  more  extensive  than  the\n\nevidence offered at the  time of his original sentence.   The\n\ndistrict  court   gave  Wlodyka  a  two-point  reduction  for\n\nacceptance of responsibility, which  had been withheld in the\n\noriginal sentence, and determined  that he had reduced mental\n\ncapacity  as well as a  serious medical condition  due to his\n\ncurrent HIV  affliction.  Departing downward,  the court then\n\nsentenced  the defendant to 100 months  of imprisonment.  The\n\ngovernment now appeals.\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n     On  appeal,  the   government  does  not  dispute   that\n\ndefendant  was entitled to be resentenced because of the Rule\n\n32 violation but argues that the only remedy available to the\n\ndistrict court  was to vacate the original  sentence and then\n\nreimpose it  in precisely the  same terms.   The government's\n\npremise is that vacating the old sentence but then reimposing\n\nthe same sentence  gives the  defendant just what  he or  she\n\nwould have had  if the  Rule 32 warning  had been  originally\n\ngiven,  that   is,  a  right  to  appeal  from  the  sentence\n\noriginally imposed.  Anything more, says the government, is a\n\nsecond bite at  the apple  and a potential  windfall for  the\n\ndefendant.\n\n     In the  ordinary case,  we  agree that  the natural  and\n\nadequate remedy is to vacate  and reimpose the same sentence.\n\nBut  being  unable  to  envisage every  possibility,  we  are\n\nunwilling to establish  an ironclad, mechanical rule.  In any\n\nevent, this is certainly not a jurisdictional matter, and the\n\nobjection now  raised by the government  was not sufficiently\n\nbrought home to the district judge at or before resentencing.\n\nAccordingly,  we think  that  the government  has waived  its\n\npotential objection in this case.\n\n     At the original  section 2255 hearing, the  government's\n\nmain argument  was that the  error had been  harmless because\n\nWlodyka necessarily knew that  he had a right to  appeal, and\n\nthe  appeal  was  in  any  event  frivolous.    Although  the\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\ngovernment did refer briefly to the possibility of reimposing\n\nthe  same sentence,  this somewhat  buried assertion  did not\n\nclearly  apprise  the  district  judge  of  the  government's\n\npresent  position that this was the most he could legally do.\n\nAt the  resentencing itself, the government's argument, which\n\nwas extensive and thorough, was directed to explaining why on\n\nthe merits no lower sentence was appropriate.\n\n     The  government's  next  claim  is  that  the  reduction\n\nviolates the law of the case doctrine.  The government points\n\nto nothing specific that the district court said earlier from\n\nwhich it is now departing.  This court affirmed the denial of\n\nthe  Rule 35  motion  without opinion  and  has never  spoken\n\ndirectly about the sentence.   What has happened is  that the\n\ndistrict  court,   on   somewhat  different   evidence,   has\n\ndetermined  that  the  departure  should be  larger  than  it\n\noriginally determined.\n\n     In all events, without suggesting  that the law of  case\n\nargument is frivolous, we  think it is unnecessary to  pursue\n\nit.     As  with   the  limitation-of-remedy  issue   already\n\ndiscussed,  we think that  the government did  not bring this\n\nclaim squarely  to the  attention of  the district  court and\n\ncannot rely upon it on appeal.  Here, too, the government did\n\nmake  timely  references  in  the  district  court  to  prior\n\nrulings; but the suggestion that the district court was bound\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nby  law of  the  case does  not  seem to  have been  squarely\n\npresented.\n\n     The  government's next  argument  is that  the  district\n\ncourt erred at resentencing in granting a two-level reduction\n\nfor  acceptance of  responsibility.   The district  court had\n\ndeclined  to do so at the original hearing because it thought\n\nthat  the  defendant  had accepted  responsibility  but  also\n\nthought  that  it  was  barred from  granting  an  adjustment\n\nbecause Wlodyka was a career offender.  The government agrees\n\nthat this was error and that the acceptance of responsibility\n\nadjustment is available to Wlodyka if he otherwise qualifies.\n\n     We  see no  reason  to discuss,  or  even describe,  the\n\nmerits  of the  acceptance of  responsibility dispute  beyond\n\nsaying that  both sides  appear to have  colorable arguments.\n\nThe sentence  in this case was based  on a departure from the\n\nguideline  range.   The  district judge  knew precisely  what\n\nWlodyka  had said about his  own culpability and  when he had\n\nmade the  statements.    Whether  Wlodyka's  statements  were\n\ntechnically an  acceptance of  responsibility or fell  barely\n\nshort appears to have had no effect on the 100-month sentence\n\nultimately selected.  \n\n     The  government's final  contention  is  a  kitchen-sink\n\nargument that the entire departure was based on impermissible\n\ngrounds.   While the government  did not  appeal the  earlier\n\nsubstantial   departure, its current position--it appears--is\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nthat no departure at all is now justified.  How this position\n\nis to  be reconciled with its  prior law of  case argument is\n\nnot explained.   In all events, the  government concedes that\n\nthe grounds  cited or  apparently considered by  the district\n\ncourt are for the most  part \"discouraged\" but not prohibited\n\ngrounds for departure.  \n\n     A  clear-cut  legal  issue  would be  presented  if  the\n\ndistrict court had based the  departure upon any ground  that\n\nwas legally impermissible.  The government does in fact claim\n\nthat the court  was not entitled  to consider the  \"childhood\n\ntrauma\"  suffered  by the  defendant  because  of U.S.S.G.   \n\n5H1.12, which provides in full:  \"Lack of guidance as a youth\n\nand   similar   circumstances   indicating  a   disadvantaged\n\nupbringing are  not relevant grounds for  imposing a sentence\n\noutside the applicable guideline range.\"  It is sufficient to\n\nsay  that the  catalogue of  horrors already  recited  go far\n\nbeyond lack of guidance and a disadvantaged upbringing.\n\n     Concluding that  the district court did not act upon any\n\nspecifically forbidden grounds, we are left with the question\n\nwhether  the district  court's  action  was unreasonable,  an\n\nissue that is  open to judicial review  under the Guidelines.\n\n18 U.S.C.   3742(e)(3).  Although the issue depends very much\n\non  the  individual  facts,   we  recognize  that  review  of\n\ndepartures is contemplated by the statute and is  intended to\n\nserve  a function.    With  this  in  mind,  we  have  looked\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\ncarefully at the transcript of the sentencing hearing setting\n\nout evidence  pertaining to Wlodyka and  the district court's\n\nexplanation  for  its  action.     Having  given  the  matter\n\nsearching  consideration,  we  conclude  that  the  departure\n\ngranted was not outside the bounds  of reason and that it  is\n\ntime for this case to be brought to a close.\n\n     Affirmed.       \r                         \n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n",

Sec. 841(a)(1).  At sentencing, the district judge concluded that the defendant had an offense level of 32 and a criminal history category of 6, generating a guideline range of 210 to 262 months.  Departing downward, the court sentenced defendant to 168 months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grounds for the departure included a harrowing childhood, involving the suicide of one parent, attempted suicide by another, a stint in an orphanage, and finally rape by an alcoholic stepfather and continued physical and sexual abuse;  service in the Marine Corps in Vietnam and subsequent addiction to drugs (derived in part from treatment for injury while in service) and later treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder;  and present infection with the HIV virus.  In the sentencing memorandum, the court noted: \"overkill, life sentence, defendant dying from AIDS, Vietnam veteran, drug addicted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 18, 1990, Wlodyka asked the district court to have an appeal filed on his behalf.  The district court denied the request as untimely, and Wlodyka appealed.  On June 27, 1990, this court in an unpublished order sustained the district court's action.  This court declined to pass on the claim that defendant had not been given timely notice of his right to appeal, noting that relief on this ground should be sought under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After an unsuccessful effort to reduce his sentence by motion under Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 35, a ruling summarily affirmed by this court on appeal,  United States v. Wlodyka, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575335\"><a href=\"/opinion/575335/united-states-v-wlodyka-gary-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam), Wlodyka filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255.  He argued that the district court had failed at the time of sentencing to advise him of his right to appeal, as required by Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 32;  he also urged ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing, a claim later rejected and not appealed by Wlodyka.  After hearings in late 1993 and early 1994, the district court determined that it had not complied with Rule 32 and granted the defendant a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 20, 1994, a new sentencing hearing was held.  Defendant presented evidence, addressed to the events in his history already described, but more extensive than the evidence offered at the time of his original sentence.  The district court gave Wlodyka a two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility, which had been withheld in the original sentence, and determined that he had reduced mental capacity as well as a serious medical condition due to his current HIV affliction.  Departing downward, the court then sentenced the defendant to 100 months of imprisonment.  The government now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the government does not dispute that defendant was entitled to be resentenced because of the Rule 32 violation but argues that the only remedy available to the district court was to vacate the original sentence and then reimpose it in precisely the same terms.  The government's premise is that vacating the old sentence but then reimposing the same sentence gives the defendant just what he or she would have had if the Rule 32 warning had been originally given, that is, a right to appeal from the sentence originally imposed.  Anything more, says the government, is a second bite at the apple and a potential windfall for the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the ordinary case, we agree that the natural and adequate remedy is to vacate and reimpose the same sentence.  But being unable to envisage every possibility, we are unwilling to establish an ironclad, mechanical rule.  In any event, this is certainly not a jurisdictional matter, and the objection now raised by the government was not sufficiently brought home to the district judge at or before resentencing.  Accordingly, we think that the government has waived its potential objection in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the original section 2255 hearing, the government's main argument was that the error had been harmless because Wlodyka necessarily knew that he had a right to appeal, and the appeal was in any event frivolous.  Although the government did refer briefly to the possibility of reimposing the same sentence, this somewhat buried assertion did not clearly apprise the district judge of the government's present position that this was the most he could legally do.  At the resentencing itself, the government's argument, which was extensive and thorough, was directed to explaining why on the merits no lower sentence was appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's next claim is that the reduction violates the law of the case doctrine.  The government points to nothing specific that the district court said earlier from which it is now departing.  This court affirmed the denial of the Rule 35 motion without opinion and has never spoken directly about the sentence.  What has happened is that the district court, on somewhat different evidence, has determined that the departure should be larger than it originally determined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, without suggesting that the law of case argument is frivolous, we think it is unnecessary to pursue it.  As with the limitation-of-remedy issue already discussed, we think that the government did not bring this claim squarely to the attention of the district court and cannot rely upon it on appeal.  Here, too, the government did make timely references in the district court to prior rulings;  but the suggestion that the district court was bound by law of the case does not seem to have been squarely presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's next argument is that the district court erred at resentencing in granting a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.  The district court had declined to do so at the original hearing because it thought that the defendant had accepted responsibility but also thought that it was barred from granting an adjustment because Wlodyka was a career offender.  The government agrees that this was error and that the acceptance of responsibility adjustment is available to Wlodyka if he otherwise qualifies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no reason to discuss, or even describe, the merits of the acceptance of responsibility dispute beyond saying that both sides appear to have colorable arguments.  The sentence in this case was based on a departure from the guideline range.  The district judge knew precisely what Wlodyka had said about his own culpability and when he had made the statements.  Whether Wlodyka's statements were technically an acceptance of responsibility or fell barely short appears to have had no effect on the 100-month sentence ultimately selected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's final contention is a kitchen-sink argument that the entire departure was based on impermissible grounds.  While the government did not appeal the earlier substantial departure, its current position-it appears-is that no departure at all is now justified.  How this position is to be reconciled with its prior law of case argument is not explained.  In all events, the government concedes that the grounds cited or apparently considered by the district court are for the most part \"discouraged\" but not prohibited grounds for departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A clear-cut legal issue would be presented if the district court had based the departure upon any ground that was legally impermissible.  The government does in fact claim that the court was not entitled to consider the \"childhood trauma\" suffered by the defendant because of U.S.S.G. Sec. 5H1.12, which provides in full:  \"Lack of guidance as a youth and similar circumstances indicating a disadvantaged upbringing are not relevant grounds for imposing a sentence outside the applicable guideline range.\"  It is sufficient to say that the catalogue of horrors already recited go far beyond lack of guidance and a disadvantaged upbringing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concluding that the district court did not act upon any specifically forbidden grounds, we are left with the question whether the district court's action was unreasonable, an issue that is open to judicial review under the Guidelines.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(e)(3).  Although the issue depends very much on the individual facts, we recognize that review of departures is contemplated by the statute and is intended to serve a function.  With this in mind, we have looked carefully at the transcript of the sentencing hearing setting out evidence pertaining to Wlodyka and the district court's explanation for its action.  Having given the matter searching consideration, we conclude that the departure granted was not outside the bounds of reason and that it is time for this case to be brought to a close.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
