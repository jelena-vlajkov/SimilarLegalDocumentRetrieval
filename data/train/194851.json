Antonio Cordova Gonzalez  was disbarred by\n               \n\nthe United States  District Court for the District  of Puerto\n\nRico.  Cordova appealed  that decision.   This  court ordered\n\nCordova to  show cause why we should  not disbar him as well.\n\nThe matters  were consolidated.   We now affirm  the district\n\ncourt's order,  and disbar Cordova from  practice before this\n\ncourt.\n\n                              I\n                               \n\n     Cordova does not seriously dispute the facts as found by\n\nMagistrate  Arenas, the  committee  of lawyers  appointed  by\n\nJudge  Laffitte, and the district  court.  We  agree with the\n\ncommittee that,  with respect to the  first charge, involving\n\nthe provision of bail on behalf of Cordova's client Irma Cruz\n\nVazquez, Cordova  may not \"technically\" have  violated D.P.R.\n\nLocal Rule  401.1(C)(3).  The  rule prohibits  a lawyer  from\n\nstanding bail for  his client,  but in this  case it  appears\n\nthat Cordova's  wife  actually posted  the bond,  and it  was\n\nnever conclusively  determined that  Cordova owned or  had an\n\ninterest in the property that his wife put up to secure Cruz'\n\nrelease.    This  technicality,  however,  does  not  absolve\n\nCordova of all culpability in the matter: the committee found\n\nthat Cordova's wife posted bail \"under his auspices and  with\n\nhis  express concurrence,\"  and did  so by  pledging property\n\nthat was  subject to the  jurisdiction of  the United  States\n\nBankruptcy Court in bankruptcy proceedings that involved both\n\n                             -2-\n\nMr.  and  Mrs. Cordova.    Cordova therefore  connived  at an\n\neffort  to deceive  the  district court  by obtaining  Cruz's\n\nrelease  through the  pledge  of property  that  was not  the\n\npledgor's to give, and thus violated ABA Model Rule 8.4(d) by\n\nengaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration\n\nof justice.1\n\n     With respect  to the  second charge,  we agree with  the\n\ndistrict court  that Cordova  violated ABA Model  Rule 1.8(a)\n\nwhen he borrowed $100,000  from his client Jose Lopez-Nieves.\n\nRule 1.8(a) prohibits a lawyer from  entering into a business\n\ntransaction  with a  client unless,  among other  things, the\n\nterms of  the transaction  are fair  and reasonable  and \"are\n\nfully disclosed and transmitted in writing to the client in a\n\nmanner  which can  be reasonably  understood by  the client.\"\n\nCordova borrowed  money from Lopez-Nieves  without disclosing\n\nto his client (a) that he did not own the property pledged as\n\ncollateral, (b) that his wife -- who did own the collateral -\n\n-  and he  were involved  in bankruptcy proceedings,  and (c)\n\nthat the collateral  was subject to  the jurisdiction of  the\n\nbankruptcy court, which had not approved the pledge.\n\n     As  to the  third charge,  that Cordova  filed pleadings\n\ncontaining vitriolic  slurs on  judges and lawyers  that were\n\n                    \n\n1.   The American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional\nConduct govern the conduct of lawyers who practice before the\nUnited  States District  Court in  Puerto  Rico.   Local Rule\n211.4(B).\n\n                             -3-\n\n\"degrading to  the law, the  bar and the Court,\"  we will not\n\nrepeat Cordova's  invective  here.   We  do find  the  record\n\nadequate legally  to support the  district court's conclusion\n\nthat the  pleadings  Cordova  submitted  \"show  an  incessant\n\nincorporation  of abusive and  disrespectful language against\n\njudges  and  opposing  counsel, replete  with  offensive  and\n\nvituperative statements in contravention  of Rules 3.5(c) and\n\n8.4(d) of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct.\"\n\n                              II\n                                \n\n     We  review  the  district  court's  decision  to  disbar\n\nCordova  only  for  abuse  of  discretion,  In  re  Grievance\n                                                             \n\nCommittee of  United States District  Court, 847 F.2d  57, 61\n                                           \n\n(2d Cir.  1988); In  re Evans,  801 F.2d 703,  706 (4th  Cir.\n                             \n\n1986);  In re  Olkon, 795  F.2d 1379,  1381 (8th  Cir. 1986);\n                    \n\nStanding Committee on Discipline v. Ross, 735 F.2d 1168, 1172\n                                        \n\n(9th Cir. 1984), and we find none here.  Cordova  is a lawyer\n\nof  some   thirty  years  experience,  and   no  stranger  to\n\ndisciplinary proceedings.   See  In re Cordova  Gonzalez, 726\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 16 (1st Cir.  1984); In re Antonio Cordova  Gonzalez, 90\n                                                         \n\nJ.T.S. 28 (P.R. 1990).   His dealings  with his client Lopez-\n\nNieves show a  lack of  consideration for the  duty of  trust\n\nbetween lawyer and client that finds expression in Model Rule\n\n1.8(a).   Standing alone, such a  transgression would warrant\n\nsignificant punishment.   See,  e.g., People v.  Bennett, 843\n                                                        \n\nP.2d 1385, 1387 (Colo.  1993) (lawyer disbarred for borrowing\n\n                             -4-\n\nfrom clients); Lipson v. State Bar, 810 P.2d 1007 (Cal. 1991)\n                                  \n\n(lawyer suspended).    Here Cordova's  misconduct toward  his\n\nclient comes accompanied  by his misconduct in  the Cruz case\n\nand his  verbal attacks upon opposing counsel  and the court.\n\nCordova had been  warned on  at least two  occasions, by  two\n\ndifferent courts, that  further intemperate accusations would\n\nexpose  him to  disciplinary action.   He  continued  to make\n\nvitriolic and, as far as the record shows, unfounded personal\n\nassaults.   Attorneys  have  on a  number  of occasions  been\n\ndisbarred for such conduct.  See, e.g., In re Evans, 801 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat 706;  In re Whiteside,  386 F.2d  805 (2d Cir.  1967); see\n                                                             \n\ngenerally, ABA/BNA Lawyers' Manual on Professional Conduct at\n         \n\n101:609 and cases cited therein.  We therefore conclude that,\n\nin this case, the punishment is  not out of proportion to the\n\noffense.\n\n                             III\n                                \n\n     We reject Cordova's claim that he was denied due process\n\nduring  the  investigation  and  resolution  of  the  charges\n\nagainst him.  Although  attorney discipline proceedings  have\n\nbeen called  \"quasi-criminal,\" In  re Ruffalo, 390  U.S. 544,\n                                             \n\n550  (1968), the  due  process rights  of  an attorney  in  a\n\ndisciplinary proceeding \"do not extend so far as to guarantee\n\nthe  full panoply  of  rights afforded  to  an accused  in  a\n\ncriminal case.\"  Razatos v. Colorado Supreme Court,  746 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1429, 1435 (10th  Cir. 1984) (quoting People v. Harfmann, 638\n                                                        \n\n                             -5-\n\nP.2d 745, 747 (Col.  1981)).  See also Rosenthal  v.

Rather,   an  attorney  facing\n\ndiscipline \"is entitled to  procedural due process, including\n\nnotice  and  an opportunity  to  be  heard.\"    Rosenthal  v.\n                                                         \n\nJustices of Supreme Court, 910 F.2d at 564.  See also Lowe v.\n                                                          \n\nScott,  959 F.2d  323, 335  (1st Cir.  1992) (due  process in\n     \n\nproceeding to  revoke physician's license  requires notice of\n\nthe  charges and  an opportunity  to be  heard).   The record\n\nshows  that Cordova  received notice  of the  charges against\n\nhim, and had an  opportunity to respond to those  charges, at\n\nevery stage of the proceedings.\n\n     We also reject Cordova's claim that two of  the district\n\ncourt  judges who  took part  in the  decision to  disbar him\n\nshould have refrained from  participation.  At various times,\n\nCordova filed  six motions  to disqualify Judges  Laffitte or\n\nPerez-Gimenez.2   However, his subjective impressions of bias\n\nor  prejudice, no  matter how  vehemently expressed,  find so\n\nlittle, and such weak,  objective corroboration in the record\n\nthat we  see no reason to  deem the judges' decision  to take\n\npart in the disciplinary  proceedings an abuse of discretion.\n\n                    \n\n2.  Several of  the motions also sought  the disqualification\nof  Judge Fuste,  who recused  himself and  did not  sign the\nopinion that disbarred Cordova.\n\n                             -6-\n\nSee Blizard v.  Frechette, 601 F.2d  1217, 1220-21 (1st  Cir.\n                         \n\n1979).\n\n                              IV\n                                \n\n     Under Fed. R.  App. P. 46(b),  when \"it is  shown to  [a\n\ncourt  of  appeals]  that any  member  of  its  bar has  been\n\nsuspended or  disbarred from practice  in any other  court of\n\nrecord  . . .,  the member will  be subject to  suspension or\n\ndisbarment by  the  court [of  appeals].\"   \"[T]he record  of\n\nprior  disciplinary  proceedings  in  district  court are  of\n\nsubstantial  relevance in  determining  whether  an  attorney\n\nshould be disbarred from practice before\" a court of appeals.\n\nIn re  Evans, 834 F.2d 90,  91 (4th Cir. 1987).   Cordova has\n            \n\nneither disproved the charges  against him, nor explained, as\n\nRule  46(b)  requires, why  we  should  not impose  the  same\n\nsanction  as the  district  court.   Cordova's misconduct  in\n\ndealings with  his Lopez-Nieves  and Cruz, and  his flagrant,\n\nrepeated  disrespect for  the tribunals  before which  he has\n\npracticed, warrant his disbarment.\n\n     The decision of the district court is affirmed.  Cordova\n                                                   \n\nis disbarred from practice before this court.\n            \n\n                             -7-\n",

Antonio Cordova Gonzalez  was disbarred by\n               \n\nthe United States  District Court for the District  of Puerto\n\nRico.  Cordova appealed  that decision.   This  court ordered\n\nCordova to  show cause why we should  not disbar him as well.\n\nThe matters  were consolidated.   We now affirm  the district\n\ncourt's order,  and disbar Cordova from  practice before this\n\ncourt.\n\n                              I\n                               \n\n     Cordova does not seriously dispute the facts as found by\n\nMagistrate  Arenas, the  committee  of lawyers  appointed  by\n\nJudge  Laffitte, and the district  court.  We  agree with the\n\ncommittee that,  with respect to the  first charge, involving\n\nthe provision of bail on behalf of Cordova's client Irma Cruz\n\nVazquez, Cordova  may not \"technically\" have  violated D.P.R.\n\nLocal Rule  401.1(C)(3).  The  rule prohibits  a lawyer  from\n\nstanding bail for  his client,  but in this  case it  appears\n\nthat Cordova's  wife  actually posted  the bond,  and it  was\n\nnever conclusively  determined that  Cordova owned or  had an\n\ninterest in the property that his wife put up to secure Cruz'\n\nrelease.    This  technicality,  however,  does  not  absolve\n\nCordova of all culpability in the matter: the committee found\n\nthat Cordova's wife posted bail \"under his auspices and  with\n\nhis  express concurrence,\"  and did  so by  pledging property\n\nthat was  subject to the  jurisdiction of  the United  States\n\nBankruptcy Court in bankruptcy proceedings that involved both\n\n                             -2-\n\nMr.  and  Mrs. Cordova.    Cordova therefore  connived  at an\n\neffort  to deceive  the  district court  by obtaining  Cruz's\n\nrelease  through the  pledge  of property  that  was not  the\n\npledgor's to give, and thus violated ABA Model Rule 8.4(d) by\n\nengaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration\n\nof justice.1\n\n     With respect  to the  second charge,  we agree with  the\n\ndistrict court  that Cordova  violated ABA Model  Rule 1.8(a)\n\nwhen he borrowed $100,000  from his client Jose Lopez-Nieves.\n\nRule 1.8(a) prohibits a lawyer from  entering into a business\n\ntransaction  with a  client unless,  among other  things, the\n\nterms of  the transaction  are fair  and reasonable  and \"are\n\nfully disclosed and transmitted in writing to the client in a\n\nmanner  which can  be reasonably  understood by  the client.\"\n\nCordova borrowed  money from Lopez-Nieves  without disclosing\n\nto his client (a) that he did not own the property pledged as\n\ncollateral, (b) that his wife -- who did own the collateral -\n\n-  and he  were involved  in bankruptcy proceedings,  and (c)\n\nthat the collateral  was subject to  the jurisdiction of  the\n\nbankruptcy court, which had not approved the pledge.\n\n     As  to the  third charge,  that Cordova  filed pleadings\n\ncontaining vitriolic  slurs on  judges and lawyers  that were\n\n                    \n\n1.   The American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional\nConduct govern the conduct of lawyers who practice before the\nUnited  States District  Court in  Puerto  Rico.   Local Rule\n211.4(B).\n\n                             -3-\n\n\"degrading to  the law, the  bar and the Court,\"  we will not\n\nrepeat Cordova's  invective  here.   We  do find  the  record\n\nadequate legally  to support the  district court's conclusion\n\nthat the  pleadings  Cordova  submitted  \"show  an  incessant\n\nincorporation  of abusive and  disrespectful language against\n\njudges  and  opposing  counsel, replete  with  offensive  and\n\nvituperative statements in contravention  of Rules 3.5(c) and\n\n8.4(d) of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct.\"\n\n                              II\n                                \n\n     We  review  the  district  court's  decision  to  disbar\n\nCordova  only  for  abuse  of  discretion,  In  re  Grievance\n                                                             \n\nCommittee of  United States District  Court, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506196\"><a href=\"/opinion/506196/in-re-grievance-committee-of-the-united-states-district-court-district-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 61\n                                           \n\n(2d Cir.  1988); In  re Evans,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"476669\"><a href=\"/opinion/476669/in-re-paul-g-evans/\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  706 (4th  Cir.\n                             \n\n1986);  In re  Olkon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"473655\"><a href=\"/opinion/473655/in-the-matter-of-the-application-for-the-discipline-of-ellis-olkon-an/\"><span class=\"volume\">795</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1379</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  1381 (8th  Cir. 1986);\n                    \n\nStanding Committee on Discipline v.
