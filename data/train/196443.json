Two issues -- the exclusion of expert evidence\r\n\nattempting  to  establish  an   insanity  defense  based   on\r\n\nPosttraumatic Stress  Disorder claimed to have  resulted from\r\n\nmilitary  service  in  Vietnam   and  the  prosecutor's  ill-\r\n\nconsidered reference  to religion in his  closing argument --\r\n\nmerit close discussion.  We affirm, rejecting the defendants'\r\n\nchallenges on these and other grounds.\r\n\nFacts and Trial Proceedings\r                                       \r\n\n          In the  summer of 1992, Jefferson  Mor n, a special\r\n\nagent  with  the  Drug  Enforcement  Administration  (\"DEA\"),\r\n\nlearned  from  a confidential  informant, Ram n  Malav , that\r\n\ndefendant  Carlos  Lugo-L pez   was  interested  in   selling\r\n\nkilogram quantities  of cocaine.  On  instruction from Mor n,\r\n\nMalav  confirmed Lugo-L pez' interest in a phone conversation\r\n\nand later called to  negotiate the purchase of  two kilograms\r\n\nof  cocaine.  Malav  told Lugo-L pez that he could page Mor n\r\n\n(whom Malav  said would  handle the money) when he  was ready\r\n\nto make the transactions.  Lugo-L pez had Mor n paged.  Lugo-\r\n\nL pez  left a  message for  Mor n that  the \"contracts\"  were\r\n\nready  and that he should  drop by Lugo-L pez'  house to pick\r\n\nthem up.  \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          Malav  went to  the Lugo-L pez residence, where  he\r\n\nmet  the  supplier,  defendant  Luis  Cartagena-Carrasquillo.\r\n\nCartagena-Carrasquillo  left,  saying  that he  would  return\r\n\nright  away  with the  drugs.   Cartagena-Carrasquillo  later\r\n\nreturned with  defendant Jos   L. Figueroa-Garc a and  a bag.\r\n\nThey  went  to  a room  at  the  rear  of  the carport  where\r\n\nCartagena-Carrasquillo opened the  bag and took out a kilo of\r\n\ncocaine.\r\n\n          During phone conversations between Mor n and Malav \r\n\nwhile Malav  was  at Lugo-L pez' house,  Malav  said two  men\r\n\nhad arrived to  sell two of the four kilograms  of cocaine in\r\n\nthe bag.  Lugo-L pez asked Malav  to call his partner, Mor n,\r\n\nto  come and put up the money.   In a round robin, Lugo-L pez\r\n\nkept insisting that the  money be brought to his  house while\r\n\nMalav , on instructions from  Mor n, tried to lure Lugo-L pez\r\n\nto San Juan (where  an arrest would be easier)  with promises\r\n\nhe would be paid there.   At some point during the  series of\r\n\npages   and   telephone  calls,   Cartagena-Carrasquillo  and\r\n\nFigueroa-Garc a left to  sell one  of the  kilos to  another.\r\n\nWhen  the  two returned,  Lugo-L pez  and  Malav  were  still\r\n\nsallying about where  the sale would take  place.  Cartagena-\r\n\nCarrasquillo got upset with the delay  and left in a car with\r\n\nFigueroa-Garc a.\r\n\n          Law enforcement agents shadowed the car, driven  by\r\n\nFigueroa-Garc a,  and saw  Cartagena-Carrasquillo get  out of\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nthe  car carrying a tan bag.   When agents approached him, he\r\n\ngot back into the car  and fled with Figueroa-Garc a.   A car\r\n\nchase  resulted, ending in a public housing project.  The two\r\n\nmen fled by  foot and were  ultimately arrested.   Cartagena-\r\n\nCarrasquillo,  who had  the  tan bag  in  his hands  when  he\r\n\nabandoned  the car,  did not  have it  when he  was arrested.\r\n\nAgents later found  it in a  trash can in  the area where  he\r\n\nfirst  fled on foot.  It contained three kilograms of cocaine\r\n\nand $12,900 in cash.\r\n\n          On June 17,  1992, a  grand jury  returned a  four-\r\n\ncount   indictment   charging  that   Lugo-L pez,  Cartagena-\r\n\nCarrasquillo,  Figueroa-Garc a,  and   another,  aiding   and\r\n\nabetting each other, possessed with intent to distribute some\r\n\n3303.96  grams  of  cocaine  in  violation  of  21  U.S.C.   \r\n\n841(a)(1)  and 18 U.S.C.   2.  Lugo-L pez was also charged in\r\n\ntwo  counts with  using a  telephone in  furtherance  of drug\r\n\ndistribution in violation of 21 U.S.C.   843(b).\r\n\n          Trial  started on  November 30,  1993.   After four\r\n\ndays of  testimony, defendants  requested and were  granted a\r\n\nmistrial.   Cartagena-Carrasquillo  and Lugo-L pez  moved for\r\n\ndismissal on  double jeopardy grounds.   The district court's\r\n\ndenial of the motion was appealed.\r\n\n          While that  appeal was  pending, this case  went to\r\n\ntrial  for the  second  time  on  February  14,  1994.    The\r\n\ndefendants were found guilty of all counts.  The appeals from\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nthe conviction  were consolidated  with the appeals  from the\r\n\ndenial  of  the  motion  to  dismiss  on  grounds  of  double\r\n\njeopardy.\r\n\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder\r                                          \r\n\n          Lugo-L pez argues there was  error in the exclusion\r\n\nof  his  proffered expert  testimony  that  he suffered  from\r\n\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder  (\"PTSD\") and  his attempts  to\r\n\nbase an insanity defense on PTSD.1 \r\n\n          The insanity defense, set forth at  18 U.S.C.   17,\r\n\nis an affirmative defense.  The burden is on the defendant to\r\n\nshow by clear and convincing evidence, see 18 U.S.C.   17(b),\r                                                      \r\n\nthat:\r\n\n          at the time of the commission of the acts\r\n          constituting the  offense, the defendant,\r\n          as a result of a severe mental disease or\r\n          defect,  was  unable  to  appreciate  the\r\n          nature and quality or the wrongfulness of\r\n          his acts.  Mental  disease or defect does\r\n          not otherwise constitute a defense.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Lugo-L pez  is a  Vietnam   veteran  who asserted  he was\r\nexposed  to Agent  Orange, has  been hospitalized  for mental\r\nillness and  had been  diagnosed as  schizophrenic.  He  also\r\nasserted  that  he  suffers  from PTSD,  which  is  a  mental\r\ndisorder recognized in the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\r                                                                         \r\nof Mental Disorders 424-29 (4th ed. 1994).  PTSD is caused by\r                               \r\nexposure to an extreme traumatic stressor involving actual or\r\nthreatened death or  serious injury or other  threat to one's\r\nphysical integrity and  tends to result  in symptoms such  as\r\nre-experiencing  the traumatic  event,  a  tendency to  avoid\r\nstimuli  associated  with  the  trauma,  numbing  of  general\r\nresponsiveness, and increased arousal.  Id. at 424.\r                                                       \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n18  U.S.C.    17(a).   There  is  a procedural  component  to\r\n\nassertion of the defense as  well.  Rule 12.2 of  the Federal\r\n\nRules  of  Criminal  Procedure  requires that  notice  of  an\r\n\nintention  to raise the insanity defense must be given by the\r\n\ndefendant to the government \"within the time provided for the\r\n\nfiling of pretrial motions or at such later time as the court\r\n\nmay  direct.\"   If  such notice  is  not given,  the insanity\r\n\ndefense may not be raised.\r\n\n          The   trial  court   excluded  the   PTSD  evidence\r\n\nprimarily because  it felt  inadequate notice had  been given\r\n\nand   secondarily  because   it  thought  the   evidence  was\r\n\ninsufficient  in  any event.    The  standard of  review  for\r\n\nexcluding  the   testimony  under  Rule  12.2   is  abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion.   See United  States v.  Cameron, 907  F.2d 1051,\r                                                        \r\n\n1059  (11th Cir.  1990);  United States  v.

The motion  indicated that Lugo-L pez would present\r\n\nthe testimony  of both Luis Falc n-Torres,  his caseworker at\r\n\nthe Puerto Rico Vietnam  Veteran's Assistance Program, and an\r\n\nas yet unnamed expert on PTSD.  The motion also said that the\r\n\nfacts  surrounding the  commission of  the crime  showed that\r\n\ndefendant  was  suffering  from  delusions or  a  disease  or\r\n\ndisorder that affected his conduct.  The motion was discussed\r\n\nin a February 1, 1994 status conference and the judge hearing\r\n\nthat motion \"noted\" that Lugo-L pez \"shall raise at trial the\r\n\ndefense  of  insanity\" and  that  \"[t]he  issue whether  post\r\n\ntraumatic stress disorder is  admissible shall be resolved at\r\n\ntrial.\"  \r\n\n          The   government,   aware   only   of   psychiatric\r\n\nevaluations performed by a Dr. Cabrera earlier on defendant's\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\ncompetence  to  stand  trial,   on  February  4  requested  a\r\n\npreliminary hearing on the admissibility of the proposed PTSD\r\n\ntestimony.  On  February 9, Lugo-L pez responded  and filed a\r\n\nmotion  stating his  intent to  offer a  Dr. Santiago  as his\r\n\nexpert witness and requesting authorization for this expert's\r\n\nservices.   The  authorization was  granted, and  counsel was\r\n\n\"reminded that the admissibility  of Dr. Santiago's testimony\r\n\n[would be] left to the trial judge.\"\r\n\n          Trial started before a different judge  on February\r\n\n14.   At no time did Lugo-L pez file proposed instructions on\r\n\nan  insanity defense, although on  the first day  of trial he\r\n\ndid  file  a  memorandum of  law  as  to  whether PTSD  could\r\n\nconstitute an insanity defense.  On the fifth day of the six-\r\n\nday  trial, the issue of the PTSD defense came up indirectly,\r\n\nduring  colloquy  concerning  an  objection   to  the  social\r\n\nworker's testimony  as to Lugo-L pez' war  record and medals.\r\n\nThe court noted at a  sidebar conference that such  testimony\r\n\nwould be admissible,  if at  all,2 only if  the PTSD  defense\r\n\nwas admissible and asked  to see psychiatric expert's report.\r\n\nLater, after review  of the report, the trial  court excluded\r\n\nthe insanity defense.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The  trial  judge later  ruled  the war-record  testimony\r\ninadmissible for  other reasons.   Thus, we  understand Lugo-\r\nL pez' appeal on the insanity defense issue to be focussed on\r\nthe exclusion  of the  expert testimony of  his psychiatrist.\r\nThe social  worker's testimony was not  intended to establish\r\nthe  defense;  at  most  it would  buttress  the  psychiatric\r\ntestimony.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          The defense  was, we think, timely  raised in light\r\n\nof the pre-trial  rulings of the conference judge  noting the\r\n\nraising of the defense  and reserving the admissibility issue\r\n\nto  trial and the later authorization of the retention of the\r\n\npsychiatric expert.

But  we\r                                            \r\n\nalso  hold that there was no abuse in excluding the testimony\r\n\nproffered  for  certain other  reasons  stated  by the  trial\r\n\njudge.   The trial judge found that Dr. Santiago's report was\r\n\nat best conclusory  in that it did \"not show  in what way the\r\n\nPTSD   syndrome   could   relieve   the   defendant   of  the\r\n\nresponsibility  for the  crimes charged\"; that  the testimony\r\n\nwas insufficient as  a matter of law in that it did not go to\r\n\nLugo-L pez' state of mind  on the dates of commission  of the\r\n\ncrimes charged,  and that it  would be unduly  prejudicial in\r\n\nviolation of Rule 403 in light of its lesser probative value.\r\n\n          The only witness proffered to establish the defense\r\n\nwas Dr. Santiago.  As to PTSD, the expert's report stated, in\r\n\npertinent part:\r\n\n          [Lugo-L pez] justifies  his behavior with\r\n          his  special army  training and  his Viet\r\n          Nam  experience when his  main problem is\r\n          his poor judgment -- he cannot anticipate\r\n          the consequences of  his behavior most of\r\n          the time.  His schizophrenic make up adds\r\n          to his difficulties.\r\n\nThe psychiatrist's diagnosis was that:\r\n\n          [C]ocaine and heroin use and dependency .\r\n          . . together with his  schizophrenic make\r\n          up explain his  grandiose and  delusional\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          behavior, [e]specially in relation to the\r\n          informant during investigation.\r\n\nThe report concluded:\r\n\n          There is no doubt  that the patient meets\r\n          the criteria for a P.T.S.D. patient [and]\r\n          was  having delusions  when he  was being\r\n          intervened  (sic)  by a  D.E.A. confident\r\n          (sic)  and it is  confirmed in the report\r\n          prepared by D.E.A. agents. . . .   At the\r\n          time  of the  intervention of  the D.E.A.\r\n          representatives, Mr. Lugo because  of his\r\n          delusions of grandeur  had a  significant\r\n          mental disease and was unable  to conform\r\n          his  conduct to  the requirements  of the\r\n          law.\r\n\n          There was  no abuse of discretion  in excluding the\r\n\ntestimony  based on this  proffer.  The  report is singularly\r\n\nunfocussed  and does not address  whether at the  time of the\r\n\ncommission of the crimes charged, Lugo-L pez \"as a result  of\r\n\na severe mental  disease or defect, was  unable to appreciate\r\n\nthe nature  and quality or the wrongfulness  of his act.\"  18\r\n\nU.S.C.    17.  As the  statute itself says, the  mere fact of\r\n\n\"mental  disease or  defect does  not otherwise  constitute a\r\n\ndefense.\"  Id.\r                          \r\n\n          The report does not  establish that Lugo-L pez  was\r\n\nsuffering  from a  \"severe\" mental  disorder  at the  time of\r\n\ncommission  of the  offenses; at  most, it  characterizes his\r\n\nclaimed  disorder  as  \"significant.\"    Indeed,  the  report\r\n\nrecounts  that by 1992, the year of the crime, Lugo-L pez had\r\n\nstopped using his drugs  of choice, heroin and cocaine.   His\r\n\nhospitalizations for  schizophrenia  had  been  more  than  a\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\ndecade  before.   His  mental  status  at  the  time  of  Dr.\r\n\nSantiago's   examination  was   described  as   \"mild[ly]  to\r\n\nmoderate[ly]  depress[ed],\"  \"logical  and coherent\"  but  at\r\n\ntimes  \"irrelevant,\"  \"well  oriented  in  time,  place,  and\r\n\nperson,\" suffering from \"poor judgment\" and being \"insecure.\"\r\n\nThe legislative history of 18 U.S.C.   17 reveals that:\r\n\n          The  concept of  severity  was  added  to\r\n          emphasize  that   non-psychotic  behavior\r\n          disorders   or   neuroses   such  as   an\r\n          \"inadequate    personality,\"    \"immature\r\n          personality,\"  or  a  pattern  of  \"anti-\r\n          social\r                           tendencies\"donot\r                                          constitutethedefense.\r\n\nS.

Salava, 978 F.2d 320, 323 (7th Cir. 1992).\r                     \r\n\n          There is nothing in the psychiatrist's report which\r\n\nsuggests  that  the  defendant  did  not know  or  could  not\r\n\nappreciate  that selling  cocaine was  wrong.   At  best, the\r\n\nreport accepts and repeats Lugo-L pez' statements that he was\r\n\nsuffering delusions at the time that Malav  approached him to\r\n\nask whether he would  sell Malav  drugs.  Lugo-L pez  said he\r\n\nwas \"feeling\" he was a CIA spy with connections to the police\r\n\nin  Haiti.  The report does not  link such a delusion with an\r\n\nincapacity to  determine whether  selling  cocaine is  wrong.\r\n\nMoreover, there  is no explanation  as to why  such delusions\r\n\nwould be associated  with PTSD.  And there  is no evidence in\r\n\nthe report  or otherwise  that Lugo-L pez was  suffering from\r\n\nany effects, delusional  or otherwise, on the  dates when the\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\ncrimes   --   the   drug   transaction  and   the   telephone\r\n\nconversations -- actually took place.\r\n\n          The psychiatrist's  testimony is the  only evidence\r\n\nthe defendant offered to establish the insanity defense.  The\r\n\npsychiatrist's report  is inadequate  to establish that  as a\r\n\nresult  of his PTSD Lugo-L pez was  \"unable to appreciate the\r\n\nnature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts.\"  See  18\r                                                                     \r\n\nU.S.C.    17(a);  Duggan, 743  F.2d at  81 (expert  affidavit\r                                    \r\n\nasserted that \"as a  result of [PTSD], [defendants] were  not\r\n\nable  to  conform their  conduct to  the requirements  of the\r\n\nlaw,\"  but  contained no  evidence  or  clinical findings  in\r\n\nsupport of these conclusions and was thus inadequate to raise\r\n\nthe insanity defense in compliance with Rule 12.2); see  also\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v.

The proffered  insanity\r\ndefense,  supported  only  by  vague,  weak   and  conclusory\r\ntestimony,  could skeptically be viewed as  only a pretext to\r\nget before the  jury the extremely sad and  sympathetic story\r\nof a much decorated Vietnam war hero gone far astray.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nReligious Reference\r                               \r\n\n          Cartagena-Carrasquillo,  who throughout  trial wore\r\n\nwhite clothing, a possible marker  of adherence to a minority\r\n\nreligious  sect, now  objects on  appeal to  the prosecutor's\r\n\nclosing arguments  which, in an apparent  effort to discredit\r\n\nthe defendant's  testimony, embraced Catholicism.   While the\r\n\nprosecutor's argument was improper, that is not enough to win\r\n\nthe  day for  this defendant,  who did  not properly  make or\r\n\npreserve  his objection, and as to whom the evidence of guilt\r\n\nwas overwhelming.\r\n\n          We know only from  assertions of defense counsel on\r\n\nthis  appeal, which  the  government on  questioning at  oral\r\n\nargument  conceded,  that  Cartagena-Carrasquillo wore  white\r\n\nclothing at trial  and that  this manner of  dress in  Puerto\r\n\nRico may symbolize membership  in a minority religious group.\r\n\nWe do not know, nor apparently  did the jury, whether he  was\r\n\nin fact  a member of  such a  group nor the  strength of  the\r\n\ninference that he might be.  Nothing was put on the record.\r\n\n          The  closing argument,  though, is  on  the record.\r\n\nThe prosecutor argued:\r\n\n          When we live in the same neighborhood, we\r\n          go  to the  same  church, when  we go  to\r\n          church,   we   come  out,   we   talk  to\r\n          everybody.  Now that we are in [L]ent and\r\n          this is in \"Cuaresma\", we do \"via crusis\"\r\n          where we go from house to house and say a\r\n          prayer and meet the people there.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nThe prosecutor's reference to Lent (\"Cuaresma\"), to doing the\r\n\nway of the cross  (\"via crusis\"), to saying prayers,  and the\r\n\nuse  of  the term  \"we\"  suggested  an alliance  between  the\r\n\ngovernment  and a  church to which,  presumably, many  of the\r\n\njurors,  but  not  the  defendant, belonged.    Injection  of\r\n\nreligion  into the case was flatly wrong and contrary to what\r\n\nthe public has a right to expect of government prosecutors.\r\n\n          Cartagena-Carrasquillo  objected to  the reference.\r\n\nThe court  responded it  would hear  the  objection later  at\r\n\nsidebar  and  asked counsel  to keep  the objection  in mind.\r\n\nDuring the  sidebar conference, the objection  was not raised\r\n\nagain  and there was no request for a curative instruction or\r\n\nother curative action.\r\n\n          Cartagena-Carrasquillo  argues  that  even  in  the\r\n\nabsence  of a renewed objection or  a request for instruction\r\n\nthat  the  trial judge  was  obligated  to  give  a  curative\r\n\ninstruction  sua sponte.   While there  may be  situations in\r                                   \r\n\nwhich  the  imposition of  sua  sponte  obligations on  trial\r                                                  \r\n\njudges  has  been considered,  see,  e.g.,  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nSantiago  Soto, 871 F.2d  200, 202 (1st  Cir.), cert. denied,\r                                                                        \r\n\n493  U.S. 831 (1989), we decline to impose one here.  Whether\r\n\nan instruction  will \"cure\"  a  problem or  exacerbate it  by\r\n\ncalling more attention to it than warranted is within the ken\r\n\nof counsel and part of litigation strategy and judgment.

In  reviewing whether\r\n\nimproper  remarks  in  a  closing argument  are  grounds  for\r\n\nreversal in that they \"so poisoned the well\" that the trial's\r\n\noutcome  was  likely  affected,   this  court  considers  the\r\n\nfollowing factors:  \"(1) whether the prosecutor's conduct was\r\n\nisolated and/or deliberate; (2)  whether the trial court gave\r\n\na strong and explicit cautionary instruction; and (3) whether\r\n\nit is likely that any prejudice . . . could have affected the\r\n\noutcome of the case.\"  Id.\r                                      \r\n\n          As to  the first prong, \"[d]efendant's religion has\r\n\nno bearing whatsoever  on any legitimate issue in  the case.\"\r\n\nUnited  States v.

Although  there was  no evidence  of\r\n\nviolation  of  that  instruction,  an  objection  by  defense\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\ncounsel to the two talking precipitated  a defense motion for\r\n\nmistrial, which  was allowed.   The trial  court specifically\r\n\nheld  that there was no  misconduct by the  prosecutor and no\r\n\nintent to goad a  mistrial.  Those fact findings  are subject\r\n\nto  a clearly erroneous standard of review.

Ct. 105 (1992).\r\n\n          Defendants   contend  that   the  conduct   of  the\r\n\ngovernment's  witness  and  the  DEA agent  was  designed  to\r\n\nproduce  a mistrial.   This  is based  on  a theory  that the\r\n\nwitness  felt he had not testified well, that he attempted to\r\n\nsignal  his discomfort to the prosecution in full view of the\r\n\ndefense, and that the hostility expressed by the DEA agent to\r\n\ndefense counsel  when they confronted him  about meeting with\r\n\nthe witness  all were intended to goad defendants into moving\r\n\nfor a mistrial.  The government's  hypothesized gain would be\r\n\na second  chance  for its  key witness  to do  a better  job.\r\n\nTheory is not fact and  the trial court specifically rejected\r\n\nthe theory as not based on the facts.  Nothing  in the record\r\n\nsuggests its findings were clearly erroneous.\r\n\n          Because  the defendants  consented to  the mistrial\r\n\ndeclaration  and because there was  no basis to conclude that\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nthe  conduct  giving rise  to  the mistrial  was  intended to\r\n\nprovoke the defendant  into moving for a mistrial,  there was\r\n\nno double jeopardy bar to  reprosecution.

Kelly v. United  States, 29 F.3d  1107, 1110 (7th\r                                               \r\n\nCir.  1994) (citing  cases).   That  the information  was not\r\n\nfiled  during the first trial did not bar the government from\r\n\nseeking  an enhanced  penalty during  the second,  unless the\r\n\ngovernment sought  to punish  the defendant for  exercising a\r\n\nconstitutional  or statutory  right.   See  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nGoodwin,  457 U.S. 368, 384  (1982).

Even if seeking an enhancement\r\n\nbefore the second trial that was not sought before an earlier\r\n\ntrial  were sufficiently  likely to  be vindictive  so as  to\r\n\nwarrant a presumption of  vindictiveness, the prosecutor here\r\n\nrebutted that  presumption.  See United  States v. Marrapese,\r                                                                        \r\n\n826  F.2d 145,  149 (1st  Cir.), cert.  denied, 484  U.S. 944\r                                                          \r\n\n(1987).   The district court, after  hearing the government's\r\n\nreasons for  the eve-of-trial filing,  determined that  there\r\n\nwas  no vindictiveness.  There  is no reason  to disturb that\r\n\nfinding.\r\n\n          Lugo-L pez also contends  that the information  was\r\n\nsigned  by  an  unauthorized  person  and  contained  certain\r\n\nmistakes  of fact.    This contention  is  unavailing.   Even\r\n\nassuming  that an  Assistant United  States Attorney  was not\r\n\nauthorized  to  sign  the  information, that  and  the  other\r\n\nmistakes could  be and were corrected  prior to pronouncement\r\n\nof the sentence, as permitted under the statute.\r\n\nSufficiency of the Evidence\r                                       \r\n\n          The claims by Cartagena-Carrasquillo and Figueroa-\r\n\nGarc a that  the evidence  was insufficient to  support their\r\n\nconvictions  are without  merit,  as the  description of  the\r\n\nfacts of record amply demonstrates.\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nChain of Custody\r                            \r\n\n          Cartagena-Carrasquillo  challenges   the  chain  of\r\n\ncustody of the  cocaine.

Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 716.\r                                                     \r\n\n          Defendant argues that the  deal was for 2 kilograms\r\n\nof  cocaine while  the  amount found  in  the tan  bag  was 3\r\n\nkilograms,  that one bag of  cocaine was opened  while at the\r\n\nLugo-L pez house, but that  no bags were opened when  the DEA\r\n\nagents  found them, and that the bags were found abandoned in\r\n\na high crime area.  From this, the defendant says, there is a\r\n\nchance of altered or substituted evidence.  This is a classic\r\n\nweight of the evidence argument.  \r\n\n          The  government  agents  testified  as   to  proper\r\n\ncustodial  procedures  and  the evidence  suggests  plausible\r\n\nexplanations  for   the  discrepancies   noted.    One   such\r\n\nexplanation  is that  there were  four kilograms  originally,\r\n\nthat  the  opened one  kilogram bag  of  cocaine was  sold to\r\n\nanother when Cartagena-Carrasquillo left Lugo-L pez' house to\r\n\nmake a sale, thus accounting for the remaining 3 kilograms of\r\n\ncocaine and the $12,900 in cash found in the bag later.\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nOther Evidentiary Rulings\r                                     \r\n\n          Lugo-L pez complains that the trial court  erred in\r\n\ncurtailing the cross-examination of an informant.  \r\n\nLimitations   on  the  cross-examination  of  a  witness  are\r\n\nreviewed for abuse  of discretion.  United  States v. Boylan,\r                                                                        \r\n\n898  F.2d 230,  254 (1st  Cir.), cert.  denied, 498  U.S. 849\r                                                          \r\n\n(1990).   Although  a  defendant does  have a  constitutional\r\n\nright  to  cross-examine witnesses  against him,  U.S. Const.\r\n\namend. VI, that  right is  not unlimited.   United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nCorgain, 5  F.3d 5, 8  (1st Cir. 1993).   Here, the  district\r                   \r\n\ncourt  refused   to  allow   cross-examination   as  to   the\r\n\nconfidential informant's  failure to file income tax returns.\r\n\nThe informant's  motive and  potential bias had  already been\r\n\nestablished.   Defense counsel  also had already  pointed out\r\n\nmany  inconsistencies  in  his  trial testimony  as  well  as\r\n\ndiscrepancies between the informant's testimony at  trial and\r\n\nhis earlier testimony both  before the grand jury and  at the\r\n\nmistrial.  The jury had ample information from which to gauge\r\n\nthe credibility of this witness.  See, e.g., United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nRodriguez, 63 F.3d  1159, 1168  (1st Cir. 1995).   The  trial\r                     \r\n\ncourt  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  in  limiting  cross-\r\n\nexamination on the failure to file income tax returns.\r\n\n          Lugo-L pez  also  complains   about  the   district\r\n\ncourt's allowance of the withdrawal of a number of pages of a\r\n\ntrial transcript  that had  previously been admitted.   There\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nwas  no  objection to  this withdrawal  by Lugo-L pez  at the\r\n\ntime; he waited  until after the verdicts had  been returned.\r\n\nEven assuming  that we should  consider this issue  given the\r\n\nlate  objection,  the  error,  if  any,  was  harmless.   The\r\n\ndistrict court ruled that this  portion of the transcript was\r\n\ninadmissible  as irrelevant and confusing to  the jury.  Such\r\n\nwas  well within its discretion.   Moreover, the only purpose\r\n\ndefendant gives to be served by the portion of the transcript\r\n\nthat was  withdrawn was to further  undermine the credibility\r\n\nof the confidential informant.   Because the jury  had enough\r\n\ninformation to  determine  such  credibility,  there  was  no\r\n\nprejudice.\r\n\n          Cartagena-Carrasquillo  argues  that  the  district\r\n\ncourt erred in allowing a DEA  agent to give his opinion that\r\n\nannotations on the back of a business presentation  card were\r\n\nrelated to a drug transaction.  Cartagena-Carrasquillo argues\r\n\nthat  the annotations  were simply  the addition  of numbers,\r\n\nfacially innocent.   This court  has previously held  that it\r\n\nwas well within  a trial court's  discretion to admit  expert\r\n\ntestimony  identifying  a similar  document  --  a column  of\r\n\nnumbers added together -- as a drug ledger and explaining its\r\n\ncontents.   United States v. Echeverri, 982  F.2d 675, 680-81\r                                                  \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1993).  There was similarly no abuse of discretion\r\n\nhere.\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nSentencing\r                      \r\n\n          Figueroa-Garc a asserts he should not have received\r\n\nany more  than the mandatory  minimum sentence of  60 months,\r\n\nbecause, he  asserts, there  was  never any  evidence of  his\r\n\nguilt  or, at  least, hardly  any evidence.   The  jury found\r\n\notherwise.  He  was sentenced  to 78 months  after the  court\r\n\nfound  he   had  not  accepted  responsibility   and  so  was\r\n\nineligible  for  a   two-level  decrease  under  U.S.S.G.    \r\n\n3E1.1(a).   He claims  he was  entitled to  a reduction  as a\r\n\nminor participant under U.S.S.G.   3B1.2(a).\r\n\n          The  defendant has the burden of showing that he is\r\n\nentitled  to  a  reduction  in  his  offense  level  under   \r\n\n3B1.2(a).   United States v.  Ocasio, 914 F.2d  330, 332 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1990).  On appeal, the defendant must establish that the\r\n\ndistrict court's determination was clearly erroneous.  Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n333.   Defendant  has  not met  that  burden.   The  evidence\r\n\nclearly  shows that he was  more than a  minor participant in\r\n\nthe  criminal venture.  He and Cartagena-Carrasquillo arrived\r\n\nat the Lugo-L pez house  together with kilogram quantities of\r\n\ncocaine.   They left together  to sell a  kilogram to someone\r\n\nelse and  returned together.   When the transaction  with the\r\n\nconfidential   informant    failed,   Figueroa-Garc a   drove\r\n\nCartagena-Carrasquillo  away.

On instruction from Moran, Malave confirmed Lugo-Lopez' interest in a phone conversation and later called to negotiate the purchase of two kilograms of cocaine.  Malave told Lugo-Lopez that he could page Moran (whom Malave said would handle the money) when he was ready to make the transactions.  Lugo-Lopez had Moran paged.  Lugo-Lopez left a message for Moran that the \"contracts\" were ready and that he should drop by Lugo-Lopez' house to pick them up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Malave went to the Lugo-Lopez residence, where he met the supplier, defendant Luis Cartagena-Carrasquillo.  Cartagena-Carrasquillo left, saying that he would return right away with the drugs.  Cartagena-Carrasquillo later returned with defendant Jose L. Figueroa-Garcia and a bag.  They went to a room at the rear of the carport where Cartagena-Carrasquillo opened the bag and took out a kilo of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During phone conversations between Moran and Malave while Malave was at Lugo- Lopez' house, Malave said two men had arrived to sell two of the four kilograms of cocaine in the bag.  Lugo-Lopez asked Malave to call his partner, Moran, to come and put up the money.  In a round robin, Lugo-Lopez kept insisting that the money be brought to his house while Malave, on instructions from Moran, tried to lure Lugo-Lopez to San Juan (where an arrest would be easier) with promises he would be paid there.  At some point during the series of pages and telephone calls, Cartagena-Carrasquillo and Figueroa-Garcia left to sell one of the kilos to another.  When the two returned, Lugo-Lopez and Malave were still sallying about where the sale would take place.  Cartagena-Carrasquillo got upset with the delay and left in a car with Figueroa-Garcia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law enforcement agents shadowed the car, driven by Figueroa-Garcia, and saw Cartagena-Carrasquillo get out of the car carrying a tan bag.  When agents approached him, he got back into the car and fled with Figueroa-Garcia.  A car chase resulted, ending in a public housing project.  The two men fled by foot and were ultimately arrested.  Cartagena-Carrasquillo, who had the tan bag in his hands when he abandoned the car, did not have it when he was arrested.  Agents later found it in a trash can in the area where he first fled on foot.

Sec. 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2.  Lugo-Lopez was also charged in two counts with using a telephone in furtherance of drug distribution in violation of 21 U.S.C.

After four days of testimony, defendants requested and were granted a mistrial.  Cartagena-Carrasquillo and Lugo-Lopez moved for dismissal on double jeopardy grounds.  The district court's denial of the motion was appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While that appeal was pending, this case went to trial for the second time on February 14, 1994.  The defendants were found guilty of all counts.  The appeals from the conviction were consolidated with the appeals from the denial of the motion to dismiss on grounds of double jeopardy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lugo-Lopez argues there was error in the exclusion of his proffered expert testimony that he suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (\"PTSD\") and his attempts to base an insanity defense on PTSD.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The insanity defense, set forth at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 17, is an affirmative defense.  The burden is on the defendant to show by clear and convincing evidence, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 17(b), that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the defendant, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts.  Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. Sec. 17(a).  There is a procedural component to assertion of the defense as well.  Rule 12.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that notice of an intention to raise the insanity defense must be given by the defendant to the government \"within the time provided for the filing of pretrial motions or at such later time as the court may direct.\"   If such notice is not given, the insanity defense may not be raised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court excluded the PTSD evidence primarily because it felt inadequate notice had been given and secondarily because it thought the evidence was insufficient in any event.  The standard of review for excluding the testimony under Rule 12.2 is abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Cameron, 907 F.2d 1051, 1059 (11th Cir.1990);  United States v. Weaver, 882 F.2d 1128, 1136 (7th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom.  Schmanke v. United States, 493 U.S. 968, 110 S.Ct. 415, 107 L.Ed.2d 380 (1989);  United States v. Duggan, 743 F.2d 59, 80 (2d Cir.1984).  A district court's decision to admit or exclude expert testimony is entitled to great deference and will be reversed only if:  (1) the decision was based on an incorrect legal standard or (2) the reviewing court has a \" 'definite and firm conviction that the court made a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached based upon a weighing of the relevant factors.' \"  United States v. Shay, 57 F.3d 126, 132 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting United States v. Benavente Gomez, 921 F.2d 378, 384 (1st Cir.1990));  see also United States v. Brien, 59 F.3d 274, 277 (1st Cir.1995) (\"[T]rial judges have traditionally been afforded wide discretion to admit or exclude expert evidence.\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 401, 133 L.Ed.2d 320 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The insanity defense was not raised in the aborted first trial, nor was it raised when Lugo-Lopez asserted and lost the issue of whether he was competent to stand trial.  One month after the mistrial, Lugo-Lopez first filed a written motion on January 11, 1994, giving notice of a PTSD defense.  The motion indicated that Lugo-Lopez would present the testimony of both Luis Falcon-Torres, his caseworker at the Puerto Rico Vietnam Veteran's Assistance Program, and an as yet unnamed expert on PTSD.  The motion also said that the facts surrounding the commission of the crime showed that defendant was suffering from delusions or a disease or disorder that affected his conduct.  The motion was discussed in a February 1, 1994 status conference and the judge hearing that motion \"noted\" that Lugo-Lopez \"shall raise at trial the defense of insanity\" and that \"[t]he issue whether post traumatic stress disorder is admissible shall be resolved at trial.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, aware only of psychiatric evaluations performed by a Dr. Cabrera earlier on defendant's competence to stand trial, on February 4 requested a preliminary hearing on the admissibility of the proposed PTSD testimony.  On February 9, Lugo-Lopez responded and filed a motion stating his intent to offer a Dr. Santiago as his expert witness and requesting authorization for this expert's services.  The authorization was granted, and counsel was \"reminded that the admissibility of Dr. Santiago's testimony [would be] left to the trial judge.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial started before a different judge on February 14.  At no time did Lugo- Lopez file proposed instructions on an insanity defense, although on the first day of trial he did file a memorandum of law as to whether PTSD could constitute an insanity defense.  On the fifth day of the six-day trial, the issue of the PTSD defense came up indirectly, during colloquy concerning an objection to the social worker's testimony as to Lugo-Lopez' war record and medals.  The court noted at a sidebar conference that such testimony would be admissible, if at all,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> only if the PTSD defense was admissible and asked to see psychiatric expert's report.  Later, after review of the report, the trial court excluded the insanity defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense was, we think, timely raised in light of the pre-trial rulings of the conference judge noting the raising of the defense and reserving the admissibility issue to trial and the later authorization of the retention of the psychiatric expert.  See Cameron, 907 F.2d at 1059.   But we also hold that there was no abuse in excluding the testimony proffered for certain other reasons stated by the trial judge.  The trial judge found that Dr. Santiago's report was at best conclusory in that it did \"not show in what way the PTSD syndrome could relieve the defendant of the responsibility for the crimes charged\";  that the testimony was insufficient as a matter of law in that it did not go to Lugo-Lopez' state of mind on the dates of commission of the crimes charged, and that it would be unduly prejudicial in violation of Rule 403 in light of its lesser probative value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only witness proffered to establish the defense was Dr. Santiago.  As to PTSD, the expert's report stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>[Lugo-Lopez] justifies his behavior with his special army training and his Viet Nam experience when his main problem is his poor judgment--he cannot anticipate the consequences of his behavior most of the time.  His schizophrenic make up adds to his difficulties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The psychiatrist's diagnosis was that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>[C]ocaine and heroin use and dependency ... together with his schizophrenic make up explain his grandiose and delusional behavior, [e]specially in relation to the informant during investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The report concluded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>There is no doubt that the patient meets the criteria for a P.T.S.D. patient [and] was having delusions when he was being intervened (sic) by a D.E.A. confident (sic) and it is confirmed in the report prepared by D.E.A. agents....  At the time of the intervention of the D.E.A. representatives, Mr. Lugo because of his delusions of grandeur had a significant mental disease and was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no abuse of discretion in excluding the testimony based on this proffer.  The report is singularly unfocussed and does not address whether at the time of the commission of the crimes charged, Lugo-Lopez \"as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his act.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 17.  As the statute itself says, the mere fact of \"mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The report does not establish that Lugo-Lopez was suffering from a \"severe\" mental disorder at the time of commission of the offenses;  at most, it characterizes his claimed disorder as \"significant.\"   Indeed, the report recounts that by 1992, the year of the crime, Lugo-Lopez had stopped using his drugs of choice, heroin and cocaine.  His hospitalizations for schizophrenia had been more than a decade before.  His mental status at the time of Dr. Santiago's examination was described as \"mild[ly] to moderate[ly] depress[ed],\" \"logical and coherent\" but at times \"irrelevant,\" \"well oriented in time, place, and person,\" suffering from \"poor judgment\" and being \"insecure.\"   The legislative history of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 17 reveals that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>The concept of severity was added to emphasize that non-psychotic behavior disorders or neuroses such as an \"inadequate personality,\" \"immature personality,\" or a pattern of \"anti-social tendencies\" do not constitute the defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.Rep. No. 98-225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 229 (1984), reprinted in U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3411, quoted in United States v. Salava, 978 F.2d 320, 323 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is nothing in the psychiatrist's report which suggests that the defendant did not know or could not appreciate that selling cocaine was wrong.  At best, the report accepts and repeats Lugo-Lopez' statements that he was suffering delusions at the time that Malave approached him to ask whether he would sell Malave drugs.  Lugo-Lopez said he was \"feeling\" he was a CIA spy with connections to the police in Haiti.  The report does not link such a delusion with an incapacity to determine whether selling cocaine is wrong.  Moreover, there is no explanation as to why such delusions would be associated with PTSD.  And there is no evidence in the report or otherwise that Lugo-Lopez was suffering from any effects, delusional or otherwise, on the dates when the crimes--the drug transaction and the telephone conversations--actually took place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The psychiatrist's testimony is the only evidence the defendant offered to establish the insanity defense.  The psychiatrist's report is inadequate to establish that as a result of his PTSD Lugo-Lopez was \"unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts.\"   See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 17(a);  Duggan, 743 F.2d at 81 (expert affidavit asserted that \"as a result of [PTSD], [defendants] were not able to conform their conduct to the requirements of the law,\" but contained no evidence or clinical findings in support of these conclusions and was thus inadequate to raise the insanity defense in compliance with Rule 12.2);  see also United States v. Whitehead, 896 F.2d 432, 435 (9th Cir.1990) (jury not permitted to consider defense where testimony could not establish with convincing clarity that PTSD caused defendant to be unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of bank robbery), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 938, 111 S.Ct. 342, 112 L.Ed.2d 306 (1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The district court did not apply an incorrect legal standard or make an error in judgment in excluding the psychiatrist's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Religious Reference</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cartagena-Carrasquillo, who throughout trial wore white clothing, a possible marker of adherence to a minority religious sect, now objects on appeal to the prosecutor's closing arguments which, in an apparent effort to discredit the defendant's testimony, embraced Catholicism.  While the prosecutor's argument was improper, that is not enough to win the day for this defendant, who did not properly make or preserve his objection, and as to whom the evidence of guilt was overwhelming.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We know only from assertions of defense counsel on this appeal, which the government on questioning at oral argument conceded, that Cartagena-Carrasquillo wore white clothing at trial and that this manner of dress in Puerto Rico may symbolize membership in a minority religious group.  We do not know, nor apparently did the jury, whether he was in fact a member of such a group nor the strength of the inference that he might be.  Nothing was put on the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The closing argument, though, is on the record.  The prosecutor argued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>When we live in the same neighborhood, we go to the same church, when we go to church, we come out, we talk to everybody.  Now that we are in [L]ent and this is in \"Cuaresma\", we do \"via crusis\" where we go from house to house and say a prayer and meet the people there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor's reference to Lent (\"Cuaresma\"), to doing the way of the cross (\"via crusis\"), to saying prayers, and the use of the term \"we\" suggested an alliance between the government and a church to which, presumably, many of the jurors, but not the defendant, belonged.  Injection of religion into the case was flatly wrong and contrary to what the public has a right to expect of government prosecutors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cartagena-Carrasquillo objected to the reference.  The court responded it would hear the objection later at sidebar and asked counsel to keep the objection in mind.  During the sidebar conference, the objection was not raised again and there was no request for a curative instruction or other curative action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cartagena-Carrasquillo argues that even in the absence of a renewed objection or a request for instruction that the trial judge was obligated to give a curative instruction sua sponte.   While there may be situations in which the imposition of sua sponte obligations on trial judges has been considered, see, e.g., United States v. Santiago Soto, 871 F.2d 200, 202 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 831, 110 S.Ct. 103, 107 L.Ed.2d 66 (1989), we decline to impose one here.  Whether an instruction will \"cure\" a problem or exacerbate it by calling more attention to it than warranted is within the ken of counsel and part of litigation strategy and judgment.  The obligation to suggest the appropriate response, if any, rested on defense counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Balancing, on Cartagena-Carrasquillo's part, the failure to properly give notice to the trial court of a desire for remedial instruction, to preserve the issue, or even to create a proper record, against the isolated but seemingly deliberate injection of religion into the case by the prosecutor, we turn to a test adopted by this Court in a more straightforward case, United States v. Hodge-Balwing, 952 F.2d 607, 610 (1st Cir.1991).  In reviewing whether improper remarks in a closing argument are grounds for reversal in that they \"so poisoned the well\" that the trial's outcome was likely affected, this court considers the following factors:  \"(1) whether the prosecutor's conduct was isolated and/or deliberate;  (2) whether the trial court gave a strong and explicit cautionary instruction;  and (3) whether it is likely that any prejudice ... could have affected the outcome of the case.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first prong, \"[d]efendant's religion has no bearing whatsoever on any legitimate issue in the case.\"  United States v. Goldman, 563 F.2d 501, 504 (1st Cir.1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1067, 98 S.Ct. 1245, 55 L.Ed.2d 768 (1978).  But a reference to religion does not necessarily require reversal.  Id. at 505.   Second, while there was no curative instruction here, there was no request for one, and we do not discount the possibility that the failure to make the request was a tactical choice by defense counsel.  See United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 446 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied sub nom.  Granoff v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 80, 130 L.Ed.2d 34 (1994) and Ward v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 81, 130 L.Ed.2d 34 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, then, to the third prong of the Hodge-Balwing test and ask whether it is likely that any prejudice could have affected the outcome of the case.  The religious references in the prosecutor's closing were less a direct appeal to religious prejudice than in other cases we have considered (such as Goldman ) and there is less reason here to draw an inference of prejudice.  On objection, the remarks stopped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instructions given to the jury assisted it in keeping to the path before it, free from prejudice.  The district court instructed the jury to perform its duty \"objectively without any bias or without any prejudice,\" reminded the jury that the defendants were presumed innocent unless guilt was established beyond a reasonable doubt, told the jury that statements of counsel were not evidence, and explicitly set out the elements of the crimes charged.  See United States v. Giry, 818 F.2d 120, 132-33 (1st Cir.)  (prosecutor's improper closing argument that defendant \"sounds like Peter who for the third time denied Christ\" was deliberate and unprovoked, but was not objected to and did not produce plain error in light of overall jury instructions, even without an instruction specifically addressed to the prejudicial comment), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 855, 108 S.Ct. 162, 98 L.Ed.2d 116 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the evidence of guilt was very strong.  Cartagena-Carrasquillo was introduced by Lugo-Lopez as the supplier.  He arrived at the Lugo-Lopez house with a bag containing cocaine.  He left the house with the bag, fled when approached by law enforcement agents, led the agents on a car chase, left the car with the bag in hand, and the bag containing cocaine was found soon after the arrests in a trash can in the area where he had been.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Double Jeopardy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the origins and demise of defendants' double jeopardy claims lie in the termination of the first trial by mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mistrial was declared by the judge after the government's first witness, Malave, was observed going into a witness room with DEA special agent Moran.  Moran had been assigned to protect the witness, a confidential informant and the only witness to the drug transaction.  The court had given a general instruction to all witnesses not to talk about their testimony.  Although there was no evidence of violation of that instruction, an objection by defense counsel to the two talking precipitated a defense motion for mistrial, which was allowed.  The trial court specifically held that there was no misconduct by the prosecutor and no intent to goad a mistrial.  Those fact findings are subject to a clearly erroneous standard of review.  United States v. Serra, 882 F.2d 471, 473 (11th Cir.1989).  The trial court's denial of defendants' motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy is subject to de novo review.  United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta, 957 F.2d 18, 21 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 834, 113 S.Ct. 105, 121 L.Ed.2d 64 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that the conduct of the government's witness and the DEA agent was designed to produce a mistrial.  This is based on a theory that the witness felt he had not testified well, that he attempted to signal his discomfort to the prosecution in full view of the defense, and that the hostility expressed by the DEA agent to defense counsel when they confronted him about meeting with the witness all were intended to goad defendants into moving for a mistrial.  The government's hypothesized gain would be a second chance for its key witness to do a better job.  Theory is not fact and the trial court specifically rejected the theory as not based on the facts.  Nothing in the record suggests its findings were clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the defendants consented to the mistrial declaration and because there was no basis to conclude that the conduct giving rise to the mistrial was intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial, there was no double jeopardy bar to reprosecution.  Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, 675-76, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 2088-89, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982);  United States v.

Sec. 851(a)(1) seeking an enhancement of penalties.  While such cliff-hanging practices are not wise, the filing was made before jury selection, and that is all that was required.  Kelly v. United States, 29 F.3d 1107, 1110 (7th Cir.1994) (citing cases).  That the information was not filed during the first trial did not bar the government from seeking an enhanced penalty during the second, unless the government sought to punish the defendant for exercising a constitutional or statutory right.  See United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 384, 102 S.Ct. 2485, 2494, 73 L.Ed.2d 74 (1982).  Lugo-Lopez alleges that the prosecution made the last minute filing of the information out of prosecutorial vindictiveness arising from earlier dealings in the case.  Even if seeking an enhancement before the second trial that was not sought before an earlier trial were sufficiently likely to be vindictive so as to warrant a presumption of vindictiveness, the prosecutor here rebutted that presumption.  See United States v. Marrapese, 826 F.2d 145, 149 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 944, 108 S.Ct. 331, 98 L.Ed.2d 358 (1987).  The district court, after hearing the government's reasons for the eve-of-trial filing, determined that there was no vindictiveness.

From this, the defendant says, there is a chance of altered or substituted evidence.  This is a classic weight of the evidence argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government agents testified as to proper custodial procedures and the evidence suggests plausible explanations for the discrepancies noted.  One such explanation is that there were four kilograms originally, that the opened one kilogram bag of cocaine was sold to another when Cartagena-Carrasquillo left Lugo-Lopez' house to make a sale, thus accounting for the remaining 3 kilograms of cocaine and the $12,900 in cash found in the bag later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Other Evidentiary Rulings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lugo-Lopez complains that the trial court erred in curtailing the cross-examination of an informant.  Limitations on the cross-examination of a witness are reviewed for abuse of discretion.  United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 254 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 849, 111 S.Ct. 139, 112 L.Ed.2d 106 (1990).  Although a defendant does have a constitutional right to crossexamine witnesses against him, U.S. Const. amend.  VI, that right is not unlimited.  United States v. Corgain, 5 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1993).  Here, the district court refused to allow cross-examination as to the confidential informant's failure to file income tax returns.  The informant's motive and potential bias had already been established.  Defense counsel also had already pointed out many inconsistencies in his trial testimony as well as discrepancies between the informant's testimony at trial and his earlier testimony both before the grand jury and at the mistrial.  The jury had ample information from which to gauge the credibility of this witness.  See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez, 63 F.3d 1159, 1168 (1st Cir.1995).  The trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting cross-examination on the failure to file income tax returns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lugo-Lopez also complains about the district court's allowance of the withdrawal of a number of pages of a trial transcript that had previously been admitted.  There was no objection to this withdrawal by Lugo-Lopez at the time;  he waited until after the verdicts had been returned.  Even assuming that we should consider this issue given the late objection, the error, if any, was harmless.  The district court ruled that this portion of the transcript was inadmissible as irrelevant and confusing to the jury.  Such was well within its discretion.  Moreover, the only purpose defendant gives to be served by the portion of the transcript that was withdrawn was to further undermine the credibility of the confidential informant.  Because the jury had enough information to determine such credibility, there was no prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cartagena-Carrasquillo argues that the district court erred in allowing a DEA agent to give his opinion that annotations on the back of a business presentation card were related to a drug transaction.  Cartagena-Carrasquillo argues that the annotations were simply the addition of numbers, facially innocent.  This court has previously held that it was well within a trial court's discretion to admit expert testimony identifying a similar document--a column of numbers added together--as a drug ledger and explaining its contents.  United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 680-81 (1st Cir.1993).  There was similarly no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa-Garcia asserts he should not have received any more than the mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months, because, he asserts, there was never any evidence of his guilt or, at least, hardly any evidence.  The jury found otherwise.  He was sentenced to 78 months after the court found he had not accepted responsibility and so was ineligible for a two-level decrease under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1(a).  He claims he was entitled to a reduction as a minor participant under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.2(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant has the burden of showing that he is entitled to a reduction in his offense level under Sec. 3B1.2(a).  United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 332 (1st Cir.1990).  On appeal, the defendant must establish that the district court's determination was clearly erroneous.  Id. at 333.   Defendant has not met that burden.  The evidence clearly shows that he was more than a minor participant in the criminal venture.  He and Cartagena-Carrasquillo arrived at the Lugo-Lopez house together with kilogram quantities of cocaine.  They left together to sell a kilogram to someone else and returned together.  When the transaction with the confidential informant failed, Figueroa-Garcia drove Cartagena-Carrasquillo away.  Figueroa-Garcia then led the agents in a car chase and fled from the law.  The district court did not clearly err by denying a reduction under Sec. 3B1.2(a).  Figueroa-Garcia was not a minor participant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the U.S. Court of International Trade, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Lugo-Lopez is a Vietnam veteran who asserted he was exposed to Agent Orange, has been hospitalized for mental illness and had been diagnosed as schizophrenic.  He also asserted that he suffers from PTSD, which is a mental disorder recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 424-29 (4th ed.1994).  PTSD is caused by exposure to an extreme traumatic stressor involving actual or threatened death or serious injury or other threat to one's physical integrity and tends to result in symptoms such as re-experiencing the traumatic event, a tendency to avoid stimuli associated with the trauma, numbing of general responsiveness, and increased arousal.

Two issues--the exclusion of expert evidence attempting to establish an insanity defense based on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder claimed to have resulted from military service in Vietnam and the prosecutor's ill-considered reference to religion in his closing argument--merit close discussion.  We affirm, rejecting the defendants' challenges on these and other grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Facts and Trial Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1992, Jefferson Moran, a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\"), learned from a confidential informant, Ramon Malave, that defendant Carlos Lugo-Lopez was interested in selling kilogram quantities of cocaine.  On instruction from Moran, Malave confirmed Lugo-Lopez' interest in a phone conversation and later called to negotiate the purchase of two kilograms of cocaine.  Malave told Lugo-Lopez that he could page Moran (whom Malave said would handle the money) when he was ready to make the transactions.  Lugo-Lopez had Moran paged.  Lugo-Lopez left a message for Moran that the \"contracts\" were ready and that he should drop by Lugo-Lopez' house to pick them up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Malave went to the Lugo-Lopez residence, where he met the supplier, defendant Luis Cartagena-Carrasquillo.  Cartagena-Carrasquillo left, saying that he would return right away with the drugs.  Cartagena-Carrasquillo later returned with defendant Jose L. Figueroa-Garcia and a bag.  They went to a room at the rear of the carport where Cartagena-Carrasquillo opened the bag and took out a kilo of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During phone conversations between Moran and Malave while Malave was at Lugo- Lopez' house, Malave said two men had arrived to sell two of the four kilograms of cocaine in the bag.  Lugo-Lopez asked Malave to call his partner, Moran, to come and put up the money.  In a round robin, Lugo-Lopez kept insisting that the money be brought to his house while Malave, on instructions from Moran, tried to lure Lugo-Lopez to San Juan (where an arrest would be easier) with promises he would be paid there.  At some point during the series of pages and telephone calls, Cartagena-Carrasquillo and Figueroa-Garcia left to sell one of the kilos to another.  When the two returned, Lugo-Lopez and Malave were still sallying about where the sale would take place.  Cartagena-Carrasquillo got upset with the delay and left in a car with Figueroa-Garcia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law enforcement agents shadowed the car, driven by Figueroa-Garcia, and saw Cartagena-Carrasquillo get out of the car carrying a tan bag.  When agents approached him, he got back into the car and fled with Figueroa-Garcia.  A car chase resulted, ending in a public housing project.  The two men fled by foot and were ultimately arrested.  Cartagena-Carrasquillo, who had the tan bag in his hands when he abandoned the car, did not have it when he was arrested.  Agents later found it in a trash can in the area where he first fled on foot.  It contained three kilograms of cocaine and $12,900 in cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 17, 1992, a grand jury returned a four-count indictment charging that Lugo-Lopez, Cartagena-Carrasquillo, Figueroa-Garcia, and another, aiding and abetting each other, possessed with intent to distribute some 3303.96 grams of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2.  Lugo-Lopez was also charged in two counts with using a telephone in furtherance of drug distribution in violation of 21 U.S.C.

Sec. 17, is an affirmative defense.  The burden is on the defendant to show by clear and convincing evidence, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 17(b), that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the defendant, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts.

Sec. 17(a).  There is a procedural component to assertion of the defense as well.  Rule 12.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that notice of an intention to raise the insanity defense must be given by the defendant to the government \"within the time provided for the filing of pretrial motions or at such later time as the court may direct.\"   If such notice is not given, the insanity defense may not be raised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court excluded the PTSD evidence primarily because it felt inadequate notice had been given and secondarily because it thought the evidence was insufficient in any event.

One month after the mistrial, Lugo-Lopez first filed a written motion on January 11, 1994, giving notice of a PTSD defense.  The motion indicated that Lugo-Lopez would present the testimony of both Luis Falcon-Torres, his caseworker at the Puerto Rico Vietnam Veteran's Assistance Program, and an as yet unnamed expert on PTSD.  The motion also said that the facts surrounding the commission of the crime showed that defendant was suffering from delusions or a disease or disorder that affected his conduct.  The motion was discussed in a February 1, 1994 status conference and the judge hearing that motion \"noted\" that Lugo-Lopez \"shall raise at trial the defense of insanity\" and that \"[t]he issue whether post traumatic stress disorder is admissible shall be resolved at trial.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, aware only of psychiatric evaluations performed by a Dr. Cabrera earlier on defendant's competence to stand trial, on February 4 requested a preliminary hearing on the admissibility of the proposed PTSD testimony.  On February 9, Lugo-Lopez responded and filed a motion stating his intent to offer a Dr. Santiago as his expert witness and requesting authorization for this expert's services.  The authorization was granted, and counsel was \"reminded that the admissibility of Dr. Santiago's testimony [would be] left to the trial judge.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial started before a different judge on February 14.  At no time did Lugo- Lopez file proposed instructions on an insanity defense, although on the first day of trial he did file a memorandum of law as to whether PTSD could constitute an insanity defense.  On the fifth day of the six-day trial, the issue of the PTSD defense came up indirectly, during colloquy concerning an objection to the social worker's testimony as to Lugo-Lopez' war record and medals.  The court noted at a sidebar conference that such testimony would be admissible, if at all,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> only if the PTSD defense was admissible and asked to see psychiatric expert's report.  Later, after review of the report, the trial court excluded the insanity defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense was, we think, timely raised in light of the pre-trial rulings of the conference judge noting the raising of the defense and reserving the admissibility issue to trial and the later authorization of the retention of the psychiatric expert.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544359\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Cameron,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/544359/united-states-v-karen-cameron/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1059</span></a></span>.   But we also hold that there was no abuse in excluding the testimony proffered for certain other reasons stated by the trial judge.  The trial judge found that Dr. Santiago's report was at best conclusory in that it did \"not show in what way the PTSD syndrome could relieve the defendant of the responsibility for the crimes charged\";  that the testimony was insufficient as a matter of law in that it did not go to Lugo-Lopez' state of mind on the dates of commission of the crimes charged, and that it would be unduly prejudicial in violation of Rule 403 in light of its lesser probative value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only witness proffered to establish the defense was Dr. Santiago.  As to PTSD, the expert's report stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>[Lugo-Lopez] justifies his behavior with his special army training and his Viet Nam experience when his main problem is his poor judgment--he cannot anticipate the consequences of his behavior most of the time.

At the time of the intervention of the D.E.A. representatives, Mr. Lugo because of his delusions of grandeur had a significant mental disease and was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no abuse of discretion in excluding the testimony based on this proffer.

Lugo-Lopez said he was \"feeling\" he was a CIA spy with connections to the police in Haiti.  The report does not link such a delusion with an incapacity to determine whether selling cocaine is wrong.  Moreover, there is no explanation as to why such delusions would be associated with PTSD.

In reviewing whether improper remarks in a closing argument are grounds for reversal in that they \"so poisoned the well\" that the trial's outcome was likely affected, this court considers the following factors:  \"(1) whether the prosecutor's conduct was isolated and/or deliberate;  (2) whether the trial court gave a strong and explicit cautionary instruction;  and (3) whether it is likely that any prejudice ... could have affected the outcome of the case.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first prong, \"[d]efendant's religion has no bearing whatsoever on any legitimate issue in the case.\"  United States v.

The court had given a general instruction to all witnesses not to talk about their testimony.  Although there was no evidence of violation of that instruction, an objection by defense counsel to the two talking precipitated a defense motion for mistrial, which was allowed.

This is based on a theory that the witness felt he had not testified well, that he attempted to signal his discomfort to the prosecution in full view of the defense, and that the hostility expressed by the DEA agent to defense counsel when they confronted him about meeting with the witness all were intended to goad defendants into moving for a mistrial.  The government's hypothesized gain would be a second chance for its key witness to do a better job.

From this, the defendant says, there is a chance of altered or substituted evidence.  This is a classic weight of the evidence argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government agents testified as to proper custodial procedures and the evidence suggests plausible explanations for the discrepancies noted.  One such explanation is that there were four kilograms originally, that the opened one kilogram bag of cocaine was sold to another when Cartagena-Carrasquillo left Lugo-Lopez' house to make a sale, thus accounting for the remaining 3 kilograms of cocaine and the $12,900 in cash found in the bag later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Other Evidentiary Rulings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lugo-Lopez complains that the trial court erred in curtailing the cross-examination of an informant.  Limitations on the cross-examination of a witness are reviewed for abuse of discretion.  United States v. Boylan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538369\"><a href=\"/opinion/538369/united-states-v-peter-boylan-united-states-of-america-v-john-e-carey/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 254 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span> </span>(1990).  Although a defendant does have a constitutional right to crossexamine witnesses against him, U.S. Const. amend.  VI, that right is not unlimited.  United States v. Corgain, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194958\"><a href=\"/opinion/194958/united-states-v-corgain/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1993).  Here, the district court refused to allow cross-examination as to the confidential informant's failure to file income tax returns.  The informant's motive and potential bias had already been established.  Defense counsel also had already pointed out many inconsistencies in his trial testimony as well as discrepancies between the informant's testimony at trial and his earlier testimony both before the grand jury and at the mistrial.  The jury had ample information from which to gauge the credibility of this witness.  See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702494\"><a href=\"/opinion/702494/united-states-v-geraldo-rodriguez-aka-jose-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1159</span></a></span>, 1168 (1st Cir.1995).  The trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting cross-examination on the failure to file income tax returns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lugo-Lopez also complains about the district court's allowance of the withdrawal of a number of pages of a trial transcript that had previously been admitted.  There was no objection to this withdrawal by Lugo-Lopez at the time;  he waited until after the verdicts had been returned.  Even assuming that we should consider this issue given the late objection, the error, if any, was harmless.  The district court ruled that this portion of the transcript was inadmissible as irrelevant and confusing to the jury.  Such was well within its discretion.  Moreover, the only purpose defendant gives to be served by the portion of the transcript that was withdrawn was to further undermine the credibility of the confidential informant.  Because the jury had enough information to determine such credibility, there was no prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cartagena-Carrasquillo argues that the district court erred in allowing a DEA agent to give his opinion that annotations on the back of a business presentation card were related to a drug transaction.  Cartagena-Carrasquillo argues that the annotations were simply the addition of numbers, facially innocent.  This court has previously held that it was well within a trial court's discretion to admit expert testimony identifying a similar document--a column of numbers added together--as a drug ledger and explaining its contents.  United States v. Echeverri, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597415\"><a href=\"/opinion/597415/united-states-v-marco-a-echeverri/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span>, 680-81 (1st Cir.1993).  There was similarly no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa-Garcia asserts he should not have received any more than the mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months, because, he asserts, there was never any evidence of his guilt or, at least, hardly any evidence.  The jury found otherwise.  He was sentenced to 78 months after the court found he had not accepted responsibility and so was ineligible for a two-level decrease under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1(a).  He claims he was entitled to a reduction as a minor participant under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.2(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant has the burden of showing that he is entitled to a reduction in his offense level under Sec. 3B1.2(a).  United States v. Ocasio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548346\"><a href=\"/opinion/548346/united-states-v-gilberto-ocasio-aka-gilberto-ocasio-agosto/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, 332 (1st Cir.1990).  On appeal, the defendant must establish that the district court's determination was clearly erroneous.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548346\"><a href=\"/opinion/548346/united-states-v-gilberto-ocasio-aka-gilberto-ocasio-agosto/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 333. </a></span>  Defendant has not met that burden.  The evidence clearly shows that he was more than a minor participant in the criminal venture.  He and Cartagena-Carrasquillo arrived at the Lugo-Lopez house together with kilogram quantities of cocaine.  They left together to sell a kilogram to someone else and returned together.  When the transaction with the confidential informant failed, Figueroa-Garcia drove Cartagena-Carrasquillo away.  Figueroa-Garcia then led the agents in a car chase and fled from the law.  The district court did not clearly err by denying a reduction under Sec. 3B1.2(a).  Figueroa-Garcia was not a minor participant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the U.S. Court of International Trade, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Lugo-Lopez is a Vietnam veteran who asserted he was exposed to Agent Orange, has been hospitalized for mental illness and had been diagnosed as schizophrenic.  He also asserted that he suffers from PTSD, which is a mental disorder recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 424-29 (4th ed.1994).  PTSD is caused by exposure to an extreme traumatic stressor involving actual or threatened death or serious injury or other threat to one's physical integrity and tends to result in symptoms such as re-experiencing the traumatic event, a tendency to avoid stimuli associated with the trauma, numbing of general responsiveness, and increased arousal.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548346\"><a href=\"/opinion/548346/united-states-v-gilberto-ocasio-aka-gilberto-ocasio-agosto/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 424</a></span></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The trial judge later ruled the war-record testimony inadmissible for other reasons.  Thus, we understand Lugo-Lopez' appeal on the insanity defense issue to be focussed on the exclusion of the expert testimony of his psychiatrist.  The social worker's testimony was not intended to establish the defense;  at most it would buttress the psychiatric testimony</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We also note, but do not rest our decision on, the trial judge's concern under Rule 403.  Cf. United States v. Shay, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196160\"><a href=\"/opinion/196160/united-states-v-shay/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span>, 133 (1st Cir.1995).  The proffered insanity defense, supported only by vague, weak and conclusory testimony, could skeptically be viewed as only a pretext to get before the jury the extremely sad and sympathetic story of a much decorated Vietnam war hero gone far astray</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
