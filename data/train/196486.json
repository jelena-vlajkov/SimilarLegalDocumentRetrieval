Stork Brabant B.V.  and Stork Brabant, Inc.\r                           \r\n\n(\"Stork\")  appeal  from  a  judgment of  the  district  court\r\n\ndismissing  a  third-party  action  for  indemnification  and\r\n\ncontribution  against Ing.  Gerritse B.V. (\"Gerritse\").   The\r\n\nfacts  are set out at length in the Report and Recommendation\r\n\nof the  magistrate judge; the  legal issues  are whether  the\r\n\nMassachusetts  long-arm statute,  Mass. Gen.  L. ch.  223A,  \r\n\n3(d), authorizes the assertion of  personal jurisdiction over\r\n\nGerritse,  and,   if  so,   whether  such  an   assertion  of\r\n\njurisdiction  is consistent  with due  process.   Although we\r\n\nwould normally decide the  issue if possible on the  basis of\r\n\nthe statute, in  this case there is real doubt  as to how the\r\n\nMassachusetts courts  would decide  the statutory  issue, and\r\n\nthe resolution  of the constitutional issue  is, by contrast,\r\n\nreasonably clear.   We therefore  proceed to the  due process\r\n\nanalysis.\r\n\n     The  third-party  complaint,  which  we  accept  at this\r\n\nstage,  reveals  that  Stork,  as a  distributor,  ordered  a\r\n\nmachine from Gerritse; after  negligently and/or in breach of\r\n\nwarranty producing  a defective machine, Gerritse  sent it to\r\n\nMassachusetts on Stork's instruction.  Whether this course of\r\n\nconduct gave Gerritse \"minimum contacts\" with the forum state\r\n\nas to satisfy the requirements of the due process clause, see\r                                                                         \r\n\nInternational  Shoe  Co. v.  Washington,  326  U.S. 310,  316\r                                                   \r\n\n(1945), is  a very close call.   The arguments on  both sides\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nare ably set  forth in the  magistrate judge's report;  while\r\n\nshe concluded that minimum contacts were not present, and the\r\n\ndistrict court  agreed, we need  not decide the  issue, which\r\n\nwould  be especially  difficult if  the injured  plaintiff in\r\n\nthis case had brought suit against Gerritse.\r\n\n     But even if minimum  contacts were arguably present, due\r\n\nprocess further  imposes a requirement that  the assertion of\r\n\njurisdiction be \"consistent with traditional  notions of fair\r\n\nplay and substantial justice\" International Shoe, 326 U.S. at\r                                                            \r\n\n316, and this additional requirement controls here.  The sole\r\n\ncause  of action against Gerritse  is an action  by Stork for\r\n\nindemnification.  The parties  must reasonably have  expected\r\n\nthat any  litigation between  them  would not  take place  in\r\n\nMassachusetts;  indeed,  their  contract  included   a  forum\r\n\nselection  clause  designating   Holland  as  the  locus   of\r\n\nlitigation.   More important,  Massachusetts' interest in the\r\n\nindemnification   dispute   are   extremely    limited,   the\r\n\ncompensation of its citizen not being at stake.\r\n\n     Extensive discussion  is unnecessary because in our view\r\n\nthis  phase of the case  is directly governed  by Asahi Metal\r                                                                         \r\n\nIndustry Co. v. Superior Court,  480 U.S. 102, 113-16 (1987).\r                                          \r\n\nThere eight  justices applied the \"fair  play and substantial\r\n\njustice\" requirement to hold that jurisdiction was lacking in\r\n\nquite similar circumstances.   Thus, even if minimum contacts\r\n\nwere barely  present, a  question we  decline to answer,  the\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nassertion   of   jurisdiction    over   Gerritse   in    this\r\n\nindemnification action would still be unconstitutional.  \r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \r\n\n                                         Concurrence follows.\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n          BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring.

On the\r\n\nbasis of  a head count of the  Justices in Asahi Metal Indus.\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo.,  480 U.S. 102, the  majority concludes that  it need not\r               \r\n\ndetermine  whether the  defendant had  minimum contacts  with\r\n\nMassachusetts \"such that the maintenance of the suit does not\r\n\noffend  'traditional  notions of  fair  play  and substantial\r\n\njustice.'\"   International Shoe  Co. v. State  of Washington,\r                                                                        \r\n\n326 U.S. 310, 316  (quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311  U.S. 457,\r                                                         \r\n\n463  (1940)).   In  Ashai there  was a  holding  albeit by  a\r                                     \r\n\nplurality:  the facts \"do not establish minimum contacts such\r\n\nthat the exercise of personal jurisdiction is consistent with\r\n\nfair play and substantial justice . . . .\"   480 U.S. at 116.\r\n\nThat is the  only jurisdictional holding  in the case.   I do\r\n\nnot think we should, on the  basis of a head count,  jettison\r\n\nas  a  prerequisite  to  a  jurisdictional  determination   a\r\n\n\"minimum contact\"  analysis.  Up  until now such  an analysis\r\n\nhas  been the  required starting  front for  a jurisdictional\r\n\ndetermination.\r\n\n          The analysis as applied here, would run as follows:\r\n\nThe  question  is  whether  Gerritse has  sufficient  minimum\r\n\ncontacts with  the forum  state, such  that the  assertion of\r\n\njurisdiction  will not  offend  \"traditional notions  of fair\r\n\nplay and substantial justice.\"   International Shoe, 326 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nat  316.   The test  for the  assertion of  specific personal\r\n\njurisdiction is tripartite.   First, the claim underlying the\r\n\nlitigation must  arise out  of or  relate to  the defendant's\r\n\ncontacts with  the forum state.   See Helicopteros Nacionales\r                                                                         \r\n\nde Columbia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 414 (1984).  Second,\r                                     \r\n\n\"it is essential in each case that there be some act by which\r\n\nthe defendant purposefully avails  itself of the privilege of\r\n\nconducting activities within  the forum state, thus  invoking\r\n\nthe  benefits and  protections  of  its  laws.\"    Hanson  v.\r                                                                         \r\n\nDenckla,  357 U.S. 235, 253  (1958).  Third,  the exercise of\r                   \r\n\njurisdiction must be reasonable in light of the five criteria\r\n\nannounced in  Burger King Corp.  v. Rudzewicz, 471  U.S. 462,\r                                                         \r\n\n477 (1985):  (1) the defendant's burden of appearing, (2) the\r\n\nforum state's  interest in adjudicating the  dispute, (3) the\r\n\nplaintiff's  interest in  obtaining convenient  and effective\r\n\nrelief, (4)  the  interstate judicial  system's  interest  in\r\n\nobtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies, and\r\n\n(5) the shared interest  of the several states in  furthering\r\n\nfundamental substantive policies.\r\n\n          I  do not agree with the majority that the \"minimum\r\n\ncontacts\"  issue  \"is  a  very  close  call\"  and  \"would  be\r\n\nespecially  difficult  if the  injured  plaintiff .  .  . had\r\n\nbrought    suit   against   Gerritse.\"       The   undisputed\r\n\njurisdictional  facts are  as  follows.   Stork and  Gerritse\r\n\nsigned  a contract  in the  Netherlands under  which Gerritse\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nwould build  machines exclusively for Stork.   Both companies\r\n\nare headquartered  in  the Netherlands.    Stork is  a  large\r\n\ninternational  corporation that  does  business all  over the\r\n\nworld.    Under the  contract  Stork agreed  to  purchase the\r\n\nmachines  manufactured  by  Gerritse  and sell  them  on  the\r\n\ninternational  market.   When  the  machine  was finished  to\r\n\nStork's satisfaction, Stork supplied  Gerritse with a mailing\r\n\nlabel  and arranged to  transport the  machine to  the buyer.\r\n\nStork controlled all marketing, sales, and transporta-tion of\r\n\nthe machines.\r\n\n          Gerritse  had no  contacts with Massachusetts.   It\r\n\ndid  know from the order form  furnished it by Stork that the\r\n\nmachine was  going to  Massachusetts.   It  was delivered  to\r\n\nShawmut  Mills.    Subsequent  to  the  installation  of  the\r\n\nmachine,  Roland Dekens,  an  engineer-employee of  Gerritse,\r\n\nwhile on  a trip to the  United States as an  agent of Stork,\r\n\ninspected the machine at Shawmut Mills and submitted a report\r\n\nto both Stork and Gerritse.\r\n\n          I  think it  is  clear that  under the  traditional\r\n\n\"minimum  contacts\"  analysis  there  could  be  no  personal\r\n\njurisdiction over Gerritse.\r\n\n          But  even if  the  issue is  a  close one,  as  the\r\n\nmajority  states, that is no excuse  for not deciding it.  To\r\n\napply  the  \"fair  play  and  substantial  justice\"  doctrine\r\n\nwithout any \"minimum  contacts\" analysis ignores  established\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nlaw and flies in the teeth of binding precedent.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n",

Gerritse B.V. (\"Gerritse\").   The\r\n\nfacts  are set out at length in the Report and Recommendation\r\n\nof the  magistrate judge; the  legal issues  are whether  the\r\n\nMassachusetts  long-arm statute,  Mass. Gen.  L. ch.  223A,  \r\n\n3(d), authorizes the assertion of  personal jurisdiction over\r\n\nGerritse,  and,   if  so,   whether  such  an   assertion  of\r\n\njurisdiction  is consistent  with due  process.   Although we\r\n\nwould normally decide the  issue if possible on the  basis of\r\n\nthe statute, in  this case there is real doubt  as to how the\r\n\nMassachusetts courts  would decide  the statutory  issue, and\r\n\nthe resolution  of the constitutional issue  is, by contrast,\r\n\nreasonably clear.   We therefore  proceed to the  due process\r\n\nanalysis.\r\n\n     The  third-party  complaint,  which  we  accept  at this\r\n\nstage,  reveals  that  Stork,  as a  distributor,  ordered  a\r\n\nmachine from Gerritse; after  negligently and/or in breach of\r\n\nwarranty producing  a defective machine, Gerritse  sent it to\r\n\nMassachusetts on Stork's instruction.  Whether this course of\r\n\nconduct gave Gerritse \"minimum contacts\" with the forum state\r\n\nas to satisfy the requirements of the due process clause, see\r                                                                         \r\n\nInternational  Shoe  Co. v.

Up  until now such  an analysis\r\n\nhas  been the  required starting  front for  a jurisdictional\r\n\ndetermination.\r\n\n          The analysis as applied here, would run as follows:\r\n\nThe  question  is  whether  Gerritse has  sufficient  minimum\r\n\ncontacts with  the forum  state, such  that the  assertion of\r\n\njurisdiction  will not  offend  \"traditional notions  of fair\r\n\nplay and substantial justice.\"   International Shoe, 326 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nat  316.

Stork and  Gerritse\r\n\nsigned  a contract  in the  Netherlands under  which Gerritse\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nwould build  machines exclusively for Stork.   Both companies\r\n\nare headquartered  in  the Netherlands.    Stork is  a  large\r\n\ninternational  corporation that  does  business all  over the\r\n\nworld.    Under the  contract  Stork agreed  to  purchase the\r\n\nmachines  manufactured  by  Gerritse  and sell  them  on  the\r\n\ninternational  market.   When  the  machine  was finished  to\r\n\nStork's satisfaction, Stork supplied  Gerritse with a mailing\r\n\nlabel  and arranged to  transport the  machine to  the buyer.\r\n\nStork controlled all marketing, sales, and transporta-tion of\r\n\nthe machines.\r\n\n          Gerritse  had no  contacts with Massachusetts.   It\r\n\ndid  know from the order form  furnished it by Stork that the\r\n\nmachine was  going to  Massachusetts.   It  was delivered  to\r\n\nShawmut  Mills.    Subsequent  to  the  installation  of  the\r\n\nmachine,  Roland Dekens,  an  engineer-employee of  Gerritse,\r\n\nwhile on  a trip to the  United States as an  agent of Stork,\r\n\ninspected the machine at Shawmut Mills and submitted a report\r\n\nto both Stork and Gerritse.\r\n\n          I  think it  is  clear that  under the  traditional\r\n\n\"minimum  contacts\"  analysis  there  could  be  no  personal\r\n\njurisdiction over Gerritse.\r\n\n          But  even if  the  issue is  a  close one,  as  the\r\n\nmajority  states, that is no excuse  for not deciding it.  To\r\n\napply  the  \"fair  play  and  substantial  justice\"  doctrine\r\n\nwithout any \"minimum  contacts\" analysis ignores  established\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nlaw and flies in the teeth of binding precedent.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n</pre>",
