Given that burden,  given\n\nthe  conflicted nature  of the  evidence, given  the gaps  in the\n\navailable information that existed  up to the time of  trial, and\n\ngiven,  especially,  the  deferential  standard  of  review  that\n\npertains,  see, e.g., DiMillo v. Sheepscot Pilots, Inc., 870 F.2d\r                                                                 \n\n746, 749 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"In maritime cases, we review factbound\n\nfindings  stemming  from a  bench  trial in  accordance  with the\n\n`clearly erroneous'  principle of  Fed.

After all, when there are two plausible sets of\n\ninferences that can be  drawn from the facts, the  trier's choice\n\nbetween them cannot be  clearly erroneous.  See Anderson  v.

So it  is\r                        \n\nhere.\n\n          We need go no further.2   Because it \"clearly appear[s]\n\nthat  no substantial question  is presented\" by  this appeal, 1st\n\nCir.

In  any event,  the\ninsurer's status as a party obviously would not have affected the\noutcome either of the case or of the appeal.\n\n                                3\r\r\n",
