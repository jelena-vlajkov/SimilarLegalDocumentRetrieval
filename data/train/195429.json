In both\n\ncases,  the district  court ruled  that, in essence,  the illegal\n\nconduct  of  Telex  J.  LeBlanc  and  Richard  E.  Weinstein  was\n\nbookmaking, and  therefore, it  was more appropriate  to sentence\n\nthem pursuant to guidelines  established for operating an illegal\n\ngambling business,  rather than pursuant to  the money laundering\n\nguidelines, which  were applicable  to the  crimes to  which both\n\nLeBlanc  and  Weinstein  had  pled  guilty.    For the  following\n\nreasons,  we reverse and remand  the cases to  the district court\n\nfor resentencing.\n\n          In a  cross-appeal, LeBlanc  v.

Telex J. LeBlanc\n\n          LeBlanc and two other individuals, Stephen Dickhaut and\n\nWilliam  Byrne, operated an illegal gambling business  during the\n\nyears  1986 through 1990.   Essentially, LeBlanc was convicted of\n\nmoney  laundering based  upon his  acceptance and  negotiation of\n\nchecks from gamblers who  bet on various sporting events  through\n\nthe  bookmaking business.   LeBlanc  was an  \"agent\" for  his two\n\ncodefendants  who \"owned\" the  business, and LeBlanc  had his own\n\n\"customers\" for whom he received commissions.\n\n          The  gamblers'  checks  were  usually made  payable  to\n\nfictitious payees and  were in  amounts less than  $10,000.   For\n\ninstance, one  gambler settled a  gambling debt with  LeBlanc and\n\nhis codefendants by  giving them four  cashier's checks from  the\n\nFirst National Bank of  Boston, all dated November 26,  1990, and\n\neach in the amount of $8750.  These cashier's checks were payable\n\nto  a  fictitious  payee,   \"J.  Johnson.\"    LeBlanc  personally\n\nnegotiated one  of these  cashier's checks at  Baybank Boston  on\n\nNovember 27, 1990.\n\n          On November  12, 1992, a federal grand  jury returned a\n\nseventeen-count  indictment against  LeBlanc.  Count  One charged\n\nthat between  1986 and 1990,  LeBlanc and  two other  individuals\n\nconspired to  violate money  laundering and  currency transaction\n\nlaws in violation of 18  U.S.C.   371.  Counts Two  through Four,\n\nand  Counts  Eight  through  Sixteen,  charged  LeBlanc  and  his\n\ncodefendants  with  various substantive  money  laundering crimes\n\nincluding violations of 18 U.S.C.    1956 and 1957, as well as 31\n\n                               -4-\n\nU.S.C.   5324.\n\n          On January 25, 1993, LeBlanc pled guilty to Counts One,\n\nTwo, Nine, Eleven, Twelve, Fifteen and Sixteen of the indictment.\n\nLeBlanc's guilty pleas  were entered pursuant to a plea agreement\n\nwith the Government, in which LeBlanc  agreed that he had in fact\n\nviolated   the  money   laundering  statutes  specified   in  the\n\nindictment.\n\n          The  Probation Department  then issued  its PSR,  which\n\nindicated that,  based upon sentencing \"grouping\"  rules, LeBlanc\n\nshould be  sentenced for money laundering, based  upon his guilty\n\nplea to 18 U.S.C.    1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and (ii).1   Therefore, the\n\noffense level, as set forth in U.S.S.G.   2S1.1, should have been\n\n23.2   The Government suggested that after a three level decrease\n\nin  offense level for  acceptance of  responsibility and  a three\n\n                    \n\n1   Because  all  of  the counts  to  which  LeBlanc pled  guilty\ninvolved  substantially the  same  harm, the  counts  were to  be\n\"grouped\"  together  pursuant  to   U.S.S.G.     3D1.2(d).    The\nsentencing guidelines applicable to the specific money laundering\noffenses to which LeBlanc pled  guilty were U.S.S.G.    2S1.1-.3.\nU.S.S.G.   2S1.1(a)(2) establishes a base offense level of 20 for\nlaundering  monetary  instruments in  violation  of  18 U.S.C.   \n1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and  18 U.S.C.   1956(a)(1)(B)(ii).   U.S.S.G.  \n2S1.2(a) establishes a base offense level of 17 for violations of\n18 U.S.C.   1957.   U.S.S.G.   2S1.3(a)(1)(A) establishes  a base\noffense level of 13 for structuring transactions in  violation of\n31 U.S.C.    5324.  According to U.S.S.G.    3D1.3, the Guideline\nsection with  the  highest  offense level  must  be  utilized  to\ncalculate the Guideline range  for these money laundering crimes.\nUnder  either U.S.S.G.    3D1.3(a)  or (b),  the highest  offense\nlevel (i.e. 20) should have been applied to LeBlanc.\n\n2   In  the plea  agreement, the  Government stipulated  that the\nvalue of the funds involved  in the counts to which LeBlanc  pled\nguilty   was  less  than  $600,000.     Pursuant  to  U.S.S.G.   \n2S1.1(b)(2)(D), three points were added to the base offense level\nof 20 because the value of the funds exceeded $350,000.\n\n                               -5-\n\npoint decrease  in offense  level for LeBlanc's  mitigating role,\n\nthe final total offense level should be 17 with a guideline range\n\nof 24-30 months' incarceration.\n\n          On  June  25, 1993,  the  district court  held  a final\n\ndisposition hearing.  At  this hearing, the court found  that the\n\nconduct  attributable  to  LeBlanc  was  essentially  that  of  a\n\nbookmaker, who  took sporting bets from bettors.  His status as a\n\n\"money  launderer\" arose solely by  virtue of the  fact that bets\n\nwere placed with him by check, and these checks were subsequently\n\neither negotiated by  him or turned over to Dickhaut and Byrne to\n\nbe  negotiated by  them.   The court  stated that  LeBlanc's case\n\ninvolved  behavior that  fell  outside of  the  \"heartland\" of  a\n\ntypical  money  laundering offense  and,  therefore, warranted  a\n\ndownward departure from the otherwise applicable Guideline range.\n\nThe court then ruled  that the Guideline section established  for\n\noperating an illegal gambling  business was more appropriate, and\n\nproceeded  to  sentence  LeBlanc  to   12  months'  incarceration\n\npursuant to U.S.S.G.    2E3.1, which sets forth an  offense level\n\nof 12  and a corresponding  Guideline range  of 10 to  16 month's\n\nincarceration for an individual  with a Criminal History Category\n\nof I.\n\n          2.  Richard E. Weinstein\n\n          Weinstein  operated an  illegal gambling  business from\n\n1986 to 1991.   In January 1988, Weinstein began  accepting large\n\nsports bets from a gambler named Elliot Mael.  In order to gamble\n\nthrough Weinstein, Mael would call Weinstein's beeper and leave a\n\n                               -6-\n\ncode number representing  Mael.  Weinstein  would then call  Mael\n\nand  accept his wagers.  Mael would  \"settle\" with Weinstein on a\n\nweekly basis, and usually exchanged cash.\n\n          In  October 1988,  Mael  owed  Weinstein  approximately\n\n$200,000 in gambling  debts.  To satisfy part of  this debt, Mael\n\npaid  Weinstein  $75,000  in   cashier's  checks.    Pursuant  to\n\nWeinstein's instructions, Mael made nine cashier's checks payable\n\nto Brockton  Financial Services  rather than to  Weinstein.   The\n\nnine cashier's checks were issued by the Bank of New England, and\n\nwere  all  dated October  14, 1988.    Weinstein then  gave these\n\ncashier's  checks to  another bookmaker,  James Katz,  who cashed\n\nthem at Brockton Financial Services.  The checks  were structured\n\nso as to avoid currency reporting requirements applicable to cash\n\ntransactions exceeding  $10,000 --  eight checks were  for $9,000\n\nand one check was for $3,000.\n\n          On November 12, 1992,  a federal grand jury  returned a\n\nfive-count indictment against Weinstein.   Count One charged that\n\nbetween 1986 and 1991, Weinstein  and others conspired to violate\n\nmoney laundering and currency transaction laws in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C.   371.  Counts Two, Three and Four charged  Weinstein with\n\nvarious substantive money laundering crimes, including violations\n\nof 18 U.S.C.    1956  and 1957, as well as 31 U.S.C.    5324.  On\n\nMarch 4, 1993, Weinstein  pled guilty to Counts One  through Four\n\nof  the  indictment.    Weinstein's  guilty  pleas  were  entered\n\npursuant  to  a  plea  agreement  with the  Government  in  which\n\nWeinstein   agreed  that  he  had  in  fact  violated  the  money\n\n                               -7-\n\nlaundering statutes specified in the indictment.\n\n          The  Probation Department  then issued  its PSR,  which\n\nindicated that, based upon sentencing \"grouping\" rules, Weinstein\n\nshould  be sentenced for money  laundering, based upon his guilty\n\nplea to 18 U.S.C.    1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and (ii).3   Therefore, the\n\nbase  offense level,  as  set forth  in  U.S.S.G.    2S1.1(a)(2),\n\nshould have been 20.  The Government suggested that after a three\n\nlevel reduction for  acceptance of responsibility, as well  as an\n\nadditional two  level reduction  for his  mitigating role  in the\n\noverall  conspiracy,  the   applicable  offense  level  was   15,\n\ncorresponding to a sentencing range of 21-27 months.\n\n          On  August  5,  1993,  the  district  court   sentenced\n\nWeinstein.     The  court  departed  from  the  applicable  money\n\nlaundering  Guideline   range  because   the  court  found   that\n\nWeinstein's  behavior  essentially  constituted  bookmaking,  and\n\ntherefore  fell  outside of  the \"heartland\"  of a  typical money\n\nlaundering  offense.    The   court  instead  adopted  a  reduced\n\nsentencing  range  based  on    2E3.1, which  is  applicable  for\n\noperating an  illegal gambling business, and which  sets forth an\n\noffense level of 12 and a corresponding Guideline range of  12 to\n\n18  months'  incarceration  for  an individual  with  a  Criminal\n\nHistory Category of II.  The court then sentenced Weinstein to 12\n\nmonths' incarceration.\n\n                      B.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n                    \n\n3   The sentencing  grouping rules  operate  the same  way as  in\nLeBlanc's case to arrive at this conclusion.  See supra note 1.\n                                                       \n\n                               -8-\n\n          The  first   issue  that  we  must   determine  is  the\n\nappropriate standard  of review on appeal.   Generally, appellate\n\nreview of a sentencing decision involves three questions:  1) are\n\nthe departure related circumstances of a sort that the sentencing\n\ncourt  can appropriately rely  upon to justify  its departure; 2)\n\ndoes  the  record  support a  finding  of  fact  establishing the\n\nexistence of such circumstances;  and 3) does the  record support\n\nthe  \"direction  and degree\"  of  departure.    United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nM ndez-Col n,  No. 93-1346,  slip. op.  at 3  (1st Cir.  Jan. 19,\n            \n\n1994);  United  States v.

In United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nRivera,  994 F.2d  942  (1st Cir.  1993),  we elaborated  on  the\n      \n\nappropriate  standard of review which  we would employ to address\n\ncertain sentencing departure issues.\n\n            Plenary review is . . . appropriate where\n            the appellate court, in  deciding whether\n            the  allegedly special  circumstances are\n            of a \"kind\"  that permits departure, will\n            have  to  perform  the  \"quintessentially\n            legal\" function . .  . of interpreting  a\n            set  of  words,  those of  an  individual\n            guideline, in light of their intention or\n            purpose,  in order to identify the nature\n            of the guideline's \"heartland\" (to see if\n            the allegedly  special circumstance falls\n            within it).\n\nId.  at 951 (citations omitted).  Thus, where departure decisions\n  \n\n\"reflect a determination of the  purpose of, or an interpretation\n\nof the language  in, a  guideline or statute,  plenary review  is\n\nappropriate.\"  United  States v.

This case\n            presents  just such  a circumstance.   It\n            involves behavior that  falls outside  of\n            the  \"heartland\"  of   a  typical   money\n            laundering offense. . . . \n\n            Here,  LeBlanc  acted  as   a  bookmaking\n            agent,   an   offense   for   which   the\n            guidelines set forth a base offense level\n            of 12.  It is difficult for this court to\n            conceive of gambling  being conducted  or\n            transacted  in  any  form  other  than by\n            money or monetary   instruments.  Yet, by\n            participating in conduct which  calls for\n            a base offense  level of 12, LeBlanc  was\n            charged  with   money  laundering,  which\n            calls  for an offense  level of 17, given\n            LeBlanc's  acceptance of  responsibility.\n            In essence, LeBlanc finds  himself facing\n            a sentence far in excess of that which is\n            commensurate with his actual conduct.\n\n            While  LeBlanc's conduct  may technically\n            constitute money laundering -- an offense\n            to which he has pled guilty -- this court\n            finds that sentencing him pursuant to the\n            strictures   of   the  money   laundering\n            statute  would  present  an inequity  not\n            adequately  taken  into consideration  by\n            the  Sentencing Commission.

Accordingly, this\n            court  finds  that  a  5  level  downward\n            departure is warranted,  resulting in  an\n            offense level of 12.\n\nUnited States v. LeBlanc, 825 F.

Mass.\n                                       \n\n1993), the court, citing LeBlanc, based its downward departure on\n                                \n\nan identical  rationale.  The  court reiterated  its belief  that\n\nbecause  it  could not  conceive of  a  manner in  which gambling\n\noperations  could be  conducted  without the  exchange of  money,\n\napplication of the money  laundering statute to someone who  is a\n\nbookmaker would  always result  in a simultaneous  application of\n\nthe money  laundering statutes,  which would be  an impermissible\n\n\"alternative means  of  punishing the  prior  specified  unlawful\n\nactivity.\"  Weinstein, 828 F. Supp. at 5.\n                     \n\n          In  both  cases, the  sentencing  court suggested  that\n\nmoney  laundering offenses  that  stem from  the prior  specified\n\nunlawful activity of operating  an illegal gambling business fell\n\noutside of  the \"heartland\"  of the money  laundering guidelines.\n\nThe court's decisions were not factually tied to the specifics of\n\nthe  cases of LeBlanc or  Weinstein.  Rather,  the decisions were\n\ncategorical, legal  conclusions centered on the  intent and scope\n\n                               -11-\n\nof  the money laundering statutes, and thereby, the nature of the\n\napplicable  sentencing   guideline's  heartland.    This   was  a\n\nquintessentially legal question, and  as such, subject to plenary\n\nreview.\n\n                    C.  THE DEPARTURE DECISION\n\n          We   first  review   the  district   court's  departure\n\ndecisions    to    determine   whether    the   departure-related\n\ncircumstances it relied upon to depart downward were appropriate,\n\nand  more  specifically,  whether  the  conduct  of  LeBlanc  and\n\nWeinstein  fell outside  of  the  heartland  of a  typical  money\n\nlaundering  case.    The   Government  contends  that  the  court\n\nconstrued the  scope of 18 U.S.C.    1956 much too  narrowly.  It\n\nclaims that the actions of LeBlanc and Weinstein ran afoul of the\n\nmoney  laundering  statute,  and  both so  admitted  by  pleading\n\nguilty.   Therefore, the Government argues, the court should have\n\nsentenced them pursuant to the money laundering guideline.\n\n          LeBlanc and Weinstein contend that  the court correctly\n\nconcluded  that their  cases  were atypical  of  the usual  money\n\nlaundering  case,  and  that  their illegal  conduct  was  simply\n\ngambling.   Thus,  LeBlanc  and Weinstein  argue  that the  court\n\nproperly  found that  it  would be  inequitable to  sentence them\n\npursuant  to  the  money  laundering  guideline,  and  rightfully\n\ndeparted downward.\n\n          To determine the  applicable sentence,  a court  should\n\nfirst determine the offense  guideline section most applicable to\n\nthe  offense of conviction, which is \"the offense conduct charged\n\n                               -12-\n\nin  the count of the indictment .  . . of which the defendant was\n\nconvicted.\"  U.S.S.G.    1B1.2.  Both LeBlanc and  Weinstein pled\n\nguilty to violations of 18 U.S.C.    1956 and 1957, as well as 31\n\nU.S.C.    5324.  For sentencing purposes, the operative counts in\n\nthe indictments  charged that  LeBlanc and Weinstein  violated 18\n\nU.S.C.   1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and (ii).4\n\n          To  determine   the  nature  of  the   crime  of  money\n\nlaundering, and  therefore the  scope of the  \"heartland\" of  the\n\ncorresponding  sentencing guideline,  we  look, in  part, to  the\n\nlanguage of  the statute  and the legislative  history associated\n\nwith it.  18 U.S.C.   1956 provides in pertinent part:\n\n            (a)(1) Whoever, knowing that the property\n            involved   in  a   financial  transaction\n            represents the proceeds  of some form  of\n            unlawful  activity, conducts  or attempts\n            to conduct such  a financial  transaction\n            which  in fact  involves the  proceeds of\n            specified unlawful activity -\n\n            (B)  knowing  that  the   transaction  is\n            designed in whole or in part -\n\n               (i) to conceal or disguise the nature,\n            the location, the source,  the ownership,\n            or   the  control  of   the  proceeds  of\n            specified unlawful activity; or\n\n               (ii) to avoid a  transaction reporting\n            requirement under State or Federal law, \n\n            shall be  sentenced to  a fine .  . .  or\n\n                    \n\n4  This is so  because the counts to which LeBlanc  and Weinstein\npled guilty  involved substantially the same  harm, and therefore\nthe  counts were  grouped together.   U.S.S.G.    3D1.2(d).   The\nsentencing grouping  rules mandate that a  defendant be sentenced\npursuant to the guideline section with the highest offense level.\nU.S.S.G.   3D1.3.  In this case, the applicable guideline section\nis U.S.S.G.  2S1.1(a)(2), which establishes a  base offense level\nfor laundering monetary instruments.\n\n                               -13-\n\n            imprisonment . . . or both.\n\nThis  statute was enacted as part of the Money Laundering Control\n\nAct of 1986.

The\n\nlegislative   history  associated  with     1956  indicates  that\n\nCongress  designed the statute to  fill \"the gap  in the criminal\n\nlaw with respect to  the post-crime hiding of  ill-gotten gains,\"\n\nand intended  money laundering  to be a  separate crime  distinct\n\nfrom the  underlying offense  that generated  the money.

The  language of  the  statute, in\n       \n\nconjunction with the definitions provided in 18 U.S.C.   1956(c),\n\nindicates that Congress  intended to criminalize a broad array of\n\ntransactions  designed  to  facilitate  numerous  federal crimes,\n\nincluding illegal gambling.  See generally Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat  691 (\"Section 1956 creates the crime of money laundering, and\n\nit takes dead  aim at the attempt to launder dirty  money . . . .\n\nCongress has  made clear  that concealing  the source  of illegal\n\ngambling proceeds is just as detrimental to society as concealing\n\nthe source of  narcotics money.\"); United States  v. Skinner, 946\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 176, 177 (2d Cir. 1991).5\n\n          There  is little  question  that the  conduct to  which\n\nLeBlanc and Weinstein pled guilty not only comes within the plain\n\nlanguage  of 18  U.S.C.    1956,  but  also was  within  the full\n\ncontemplation  of   Congress  when   it  enacted   that  statute.\n\nWeinstein  asked gamblers  to structure  their checks  in amounts\n\nless than $10,000;  he asked  that the gamblers  make the  checks\n\npayable to fictitious payees; he received the checks; and he then\n\nnegotiated the  checks.   LeBlanc received and  negotiated checks\n\nobtained from  illegal gambling  activities, which had  been made\n\npayable to fictitious payees.\n\n          The  district  court  suggests  that  all  LeBlanc  and\n\nWeinstein  are really guilty of  is gambling, and  that the money\n\n                    \n\n5  The  language of U.S.S.G.    2S1.1 and  the associated  policy\nstatements are  not inconsistent with this  interpretation of the\nscope of the crime of money laundering.\n\n                               -15-\n\nlaundering statutes were improperly used as an alternative method\n\nto punish this underlying  offense.  As a preliminary  matter, if\n\nthe  court did not believe that LeBlanc and Weinstein were guilty\n\nof  money laundering,  the court  should have  refused  to accept\n\ntheir guilty pleas to those offenses for lack of a factual basis.\n\nMoreover,  LeBlanc and  Weinstein did  more than  conduct illegal\n\ngambling businesses.  Both took specific  and concrete actions to\n\nlaunder  the  proceeds  from  these  gambling  activities.    The\n\ncritical financial  transactions occurred after the  gamblers had\n\nplaced  and lost  their wagers with  LeBlanc and  Weinstein, when\n\nthey then negotiated the  checks.  The court's recharacterization\n\nof the actual conduct  of LeBlanc and Weinstein ignores  the fact\n\nthat  they both  pled  guilty  to,  and  were  guilty  of,  money\n\nlaundering,  a distinct,  successor offense.   See,  e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Morris, 18 F.3d 562, 569 (8th Cir. 1994).  \n                \n\n          Put  simply,   the  court  failed  to   recognize  that\n\ndefendants  had  committed two  offenses;  gambling,  followed by\n\nmoney laundering.  Its statement that  it was \"difficult . . . to\n\nconceive of gambling  being conducted or  transacted in any  form\n\nother than by money or monetary instruments,\" and that sentencing\n\nfor money  laundering \"would present  an inequity,\"   misses  the\n\npoint.  There  was no inequity.   Leblanc  and Weinstein did  not\n\nhave to act in a manner that patently violated 18 U.S.C.   1956.\n\n          The court  erred by construing  the scope of  the money\n\nlaundering  statute,  and  the  heartland  of   its  commensurate\n\nsentencing  guideline too narrowly.   The conduct  of LeBlanc and\n\n                               -16-\n\nWeinstein  did, in fact, fall  within the \"heartland\"  of a money\n\nlaundering  case, and therefore their conduct was not of a \"kind\"\n\nthat properly justified a  downward departure.  We find  that the\n\ncourt erred by departing downward, and that LeBlanc and Weinstein\n\nshould have  been  sentenced pursuant  to the  strictures of  the\n\nmoney laundering guideline.\n\n                               -17-\n\n                      II.  LEBLANC'S APPEAL\n\n                          A.  BACKGROUND\n\n          At sentencing, LeBlanc  moved for a downward  departure\n\nfrom the Sentencing Guidelines based upon his physical condition.\n\nLeBlanc suffered his first heart attack in 1981 at the age of 34.\n\nAfter  pleading  guilty  in  the  instant  case,  while  awaiting\n\nsentencing, LeBlanc suffered a  second heart attack on  March 18,\n\n1993.\n\n          Prior  to   the  first  disposition   hearing,  LeBlanc\n\nsubmitted a medical report  to the court from his  own physician,\n\nDr. Solomon A. Gabbay.  The report stated that \"Mr. LeBlanc has a\n\n[known] history of coronary artery disease\" and that \"Mr. LeBlanc\n\nwill probably require long term therapy for his cardiac history.\"\n\nDr. Gabbay concluded:  \"[a]t this  point in time  I would  expect\n\n[LeBlanc] to require medicine for the rest of his life.\"\n\n          The  initial disposition  hearing was  held on  May 20,\n\n1993.   The court then continued  the hearing and ordered that an\n\nindependent cardiologist examine  LeBlanc, at Government expense,\n\nand report the  medical findings  to the court  to determine  the\n\nextent and seriousness of LeBlanc's cardiac problems.\n\n          A second disposition hearing was held on June 25, 1993.\n\nPursuant to the court's previous order, LeBlanc had been examined\n\nby Dr. Guy L. Reed on June 10, 1993.  Dr. Reed issued a report in\n\nwhich he stated  that LeBlanc  had coronary artery  disease.   He\n\nconcluded that LeBlanc's \"heart  disease is likely to  be largely\n\ncontrolled with medication but  he is also at risk  for recurrent\n\n                               -18-\n\nmyocardial infarction.   Because  of his coronary  artery disease\n\nand  hypercholesterolemia,  he  will  continue  to  need  ongoing\n\nmedical care indefinitely with check-ups at 4-6 month intervals.\"\n\n          After reviewing Dr. Reed's report, the court refused to\n\ngrant  LeBlanc a downward departure based on health reasons.  The\n\ncourt stated:\n\n            I  don't read  this report  as  being one\n            that  would  even  permit me,  let  alone\n            persuade me, to go beyond the guidelines.\n\n            Now,  I  would  put it  in  those  terms;\n            because,  if  I am  wrong,  then you  can\n            appeal that.  In other words, I determine\n            that this report, which we will mark as a\n            Court Exhibit,  does  not permit  me,  or\n            there is nothing  here that would  permit\n            me  to go below the guidelines.   If I am\n            wrong as a matter  of law, you can appeal\n            it, and you can come back and we will re-\n            sentence him.\n\n                    B.  THE DEPARTURE DECISION\n\n          As a general rule, a  district court's refusal to grant\n\na  downward  departure  is  not  appealable.    United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nLombardi, 5  F.3d 568,  571 (1st Cir.  1993);   United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nHilton,  946  F.2d 955,  957 (1st  Cir.  1991); United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nRomolo,  937 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir. 1991).  Appellate jurisdiction\n      \n\ndoes attach, however, where  the sentencing court's decision \"not\n\nto depart is based on the court's mistaken view that it lacks the\n\nlegal  authority to consider a  departure.\"  Hilton,  946 F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n957 (quoting Romolo,  937 F.2d at  22).  Thus,  in order to  have\n                   \n\njurisdiction,   we  must   conclude  that   the   district  court\n\nmisunderstood  its  authority  to depart  under  the  guidelines.\n\nUnited States  v. DiIorio, 948 F.2d 1, 8 (1st  Cir. 1991).  If we\n                         \n\n                               -19-\n\nfind that the court  understood its power to depart,  but refused\n\nto  exercise that  power, we  lack jurisdiction  to consider  the\n\nappeal.   Id.    In fact,  the  district court  acknowledged  our\n            \n\nability  to review  its decision  when the  court stated  that it\n\nlacked the legal authority to depart based upon the circumstances\n\npresented to it, and that LeBlanc could appeal this determination\n\nif the court was wrong as a matter of law.\n\n          We  believe that  based upon  the record,  the district\n\ncourt  fully   understood  its   ability  to  depart   under  the\n\nguidelines, but found that it was unable to do so under the facts\n\nof  this  case.    LeBlanc   contends  that  the  district  court\n\nerroneously concluded  that it was \"forbidden\"  by the guidelines\n\nto consider his heart condition as a basis for departure.   We do\n\nnot agree.  At the first disposition hearing, LeBlanc moved for a\n\ndownward  departure based  on his  heart condition  and presented\n\nsupporting evidence from  his physician, Dr.  Gabbay.  The  court\n\nthen  continued the  hearing and  ordered the  parties to  have a\n\ncourt  appointed  physician  examine  LeBlanc  to  determine  the\n\nseverity of his heart condition.   If the court had believed that\n\na downward  departure was forbidden,  it would not  have required\n\nthe parties to  engage in  the useless exercise  of obtaining  an\n\nindependent physician's opinion.   Thus, the court considered the\n\npossibility that  LeBlanc's heart condition warranted  a downward\n\ndeparture,  but  after  reviewing   the  facts,  found  that  his\n\ncondition was not serious enough to justify such a departure.\n\n          The  court correctly  understood  that a  departure for\n\n                               -20-\n\nmedical reasons was \"discouraged\"  by the guidelines.  Departures\n\nbased  upon health  problems are  \"discouraged\" and  can only  be\n\njustified if the medical problems are \"present in unusual kind or\n\ndegree\".   Rivera, 994 F.2d at  948.  U.S.S.G.    5H1.4 states in\n                 \n\npertinent part:\n\n            Physical    condition   or    appearance,\n            including  physique,  is  not  ordinarily\n            relevant   in   determining   whether   a\n            sentence should be outside the applicable\n            guideline    range.        However,    an\n            extraordinary physical  impairment may be\n            a reason  to impose a sentence  below the\n            applicable guideline range . . . .\n\n          Based upon the facts presented to it at sentencing, the\n\ndistrict  court did  not believe  that LeBlanc's  heart condition\n\npresented an extraordinary physical impairment within the meaning\n\nof U.S.S.G.    5H1.4 that would permit the court  to depart, much\n\nless persuade it to do so, under the Guidelines.  LeBlanc suffers\n\nfrom a  heart condition.   Both Dr.  Gabbay and Dr.  Reed stated,\n\nhowever,  that LeBlanc's  heart condition  could be  treated with\n\nmedicine.  There  was no indication in either physicians' medical\n\nreport  that LeBlanc's life  would be threatened  or shortened by\n\nvirtue  of  being  incarcerated.    Additionally,  there  was  no\n\nevidence that the Bureau of Prisons would be unable to adequately\n\naccommodate LeBlanc's medical needs.\n\n          There was  nothing in  the record which  indicated that\n\nthe  sentencing  court was  mistaken  about its  power  to depart\n\ndownward.    Rather, the  court  fully  understood its  departure\n\nability,  but concluded  that  U.S.S.G.    5H1.4  simply did  not\n\npermit departure under  the circumstances.   This was a  judgment\n\n                               -21-\n\ncall  which was supported  by the record.   As such,  the court's\n\ndeparture  decision is  not  reviewable on  appeal.

Telex J. LeBlanc\n\n          LeBlanc and two other individuals, Stephen Dickhaut and\n\nWilliam  Byrne, operated an illegal gambling business  during the\n\nyears  1986 through 1990.   Essentially, LeBlanc was convicted of\n\nmoney  laundering based  upon his  acceptance and  negotiation of\n\nchecks from gamblers who  bet on various sporting events  through\n\nthe  bookmaking business.   LeBlanc  was an  \"agent\" for  his two\n\ncodefendants  who \"owned\" the  business, and LeBlanc  had his own\n\n\"customers\" for whom he received commissions.\n\n          The  gamblers'  checks  were  usually made  payable  to\n\nfictitious payees and  were in  amounts less than  $10,000.   For\n\ninstance, one  gambler settled a  gambling debt with  LeBlanc and\n\nhis codefendants by  giving them four  cashier's checks from  the\n\nFirst National Bank of  Boston, all dated November 26,  1990, and\n\neach in the amount of $8750.  These cashier's checks were payable\n\nto  a  fictitious  payee,   \"J.  Johnson.\"    LeBlanc  personally\n\nnegotiated one  of these  cashier's checks at  Baybank Boston  on\n\nNovember 27, 1990.\n\n          On November  12, 1992, a federal grand  jury returned a\n\nseventeen-count  indictment against  LeBlanc.  Count  One charged\n\nthat between  1986 and 1990,  LeBlanc and  two other  individuals\n\nconspired to  violate money  laundering and  currency transaction\n\nlaws in violation of 18  U.S.C.   371.  Counts Two  through Four,\n\nand  Counts  Eight  through  Sixteen,  charged  LeBlanc  and  his\n\ncodefendants  with  various substantive  money  laundering crimes\n\nincluding violations of 18 U.S.C.    1956 and 1957, as well as 31\n\n                               -4-\n\nU.S.C.   5324.\n\n          On January 25, 1993, LeBlanc pled guilty to Counts One,\n\nTwo, Nine, Eleven, Twelve, Fifteen and Sixteen of the indictment.\n\nLeBlanc's guilty pleas  were entered pursuant to a plea agreement\n\nwith the Government, in which LeBlanc  agreed that he had in fact\n\nviolated   the  money   laundering  statutes  specified   in  the\n\nindictment.\n\n          The  Probation Department  then issued  its PSR,  which\n\nindicated that,  based upon sentencing \"grouping\"  rules, LeBlanc\n\nshould be  sentenced for money laundering, based  upon his guilty\n\nplea to 18 U.S.C.    1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and (ii).1   Therefore, the\n\noffense level, as set forth in U.S.S.G.   2S1.1, should have been\n\n23.2   The Government suggested that after a three level decrease\n\nin  offense level for  acceptance of  responsibility and  a three\n\n                    \n\n1   Because  all  of  the counts  to  which  LeBlanc pled  guilty\ninvolved  substantially the  same  harm, the  counts  were to  be\n\"grouped\"  together  pursuant  to   U.S.S.G.     3D1.2(d).    The\nsentencing guidelines applicable to the specific money laundering\noffenses to which LeBlanc pled  guilty were U.S.S.G.    2S1.1-.3.\nU.S.S.G.   2S1.1(a)(2) establishes a base offense level of 20 for\nlaundering  monetary  instruments in  violation  of  18 U.S.C.   \n1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and  18 U.S.C.   1956(a)(1)(B)(ii).   U.S.S.G.  \n2S1.2(a) establishes a base offense level of 17 for violations of\n18 U.S.C.   1957.   U.S.S.G.   2S1.3(a)(1)(A) establishes  a base\noffense level of 13 for structuring transactions in  violation of\n31 U.S.C.    5324.  According to U.S.S.G.    3D1.3, the Guideline\nsection with  the  highest  offense level  must  be  utilized  to\ncalculate the Guideline range  for these money laundering crimes.\nUnder  either U.S.S.G.    3D1.3(a)  or (b),  the highest  offense\nlevel (i.e. 20) should have been applied to LeBlanc.\n\n2   In  the plea  agreement, the  Government stipulated  that the\nvalue of the funds involved  in the counts to which LeBlanc  pled\nguilty   was  less  than  $600,000.     Pursuant  to  U.S.S.G.   \n2S1.1(b)(2)(D), three points were added to the base offense level\nof 20 because the value of the funds exceeded $350,000.\n\n                               -5-\n\npoint decrease  in offense  level for LeBlanc's  mitigating role,\n\nthe final total offense level should be 17 with a guideline range\n\nof 24-30 months' incarceration.\n\n          On  June  25, 1993,  the  district court  held  a final\n\ndisposition hearing.  At  this hearing, the court found  that the\n\nconduct  attributable  to  LeBlanc  was  essentially  that  of  a\n\nbookmaker, who  took sporting bets from bettors.  His status as a\n\n\"money  launderer\" arose solely by  virtue of the  fact that bets\n\nwere placed with him by check, and these checks were subsequently\n\neither negotiated by  him or turned over to Dickhaut and Byrne to\n\nbe  negotiated by  them.   The court  stated that  LeBlanc's case\n\ninvolved  behavior that  fell  outside of  the  \"heartland\" of  a\n\ntypical  money  laundering offense  and,  therefore, warranted  a\n\ndownward departure from the otherwise applicable Guideline range.\n\nThe court then ruled  that the Guideline section established  for\n\noperating an illegal gambling  business was more appropriate, and\n\nproceeded  to  sentence  LeBlanc  to   12  months'  incarceration\n\npursuant to U.S.S.G.    2E3.1, which sets forth an  offense level\n\nof 12  and a corresponding  Guideline range  of 10 to  16 month's\n\nincarceration for an individual  with a Criminal History Category\n\nof I.\n\n          2.  Richard E. Weinstein\n\n          Weinstein  operated an  illegal gambling  business from\n\n1986 to 1991.   In January 1988, Weinstein began  accepting large\n\nsports bets from a gambler named Elliot Mael.  In order to gamble\n\nthrough Weinstein, Mael would call Weinstein's beeper and leave a\n\n                               -6-\n\ncode number representing  Mael.  Weinstein  would then call  Mael\n\nand  accept his wagers.  Mael would  \"settle\" with Weinstein on a\n\nweekly basis, and usually exchanged cash.\n\n          In  October 1988,  Mael  owed  Weinstein  approximately\n\n$200,000 in gambling  debts.  To satisfy part of  this debt, Mael\n\npaid  Weinstein  $75,000  in   cashier's  checks.    Pursuant  to\n\nWeinstein's instructions, Mael made nine cashier's checks payable\n\nto Brockton  Financial Services  rather than to  Weinstein.   The\n\nnine cashier's checks were issued by the Bank of New England, and\n\nwere  all  dated October  14, 1988.    Weinstein then  gave these\n\ncashier's  checks to  another bookmaker,  James Katz,  who cashed\n\nthem at Brockton Financial Services.  The checks  were structured\n\nso as to avoid currency reporting requirements applicable to cash\n\ntransactions exceeding  $10,000 --  eight checks were  for $9,000\n\nand one check was for $3,000.\n\n          On November 12, 1992,  a federal grand jury  returned a\n\nfive-count indictment against Weinstein.   Count One charged that\n\nbetween 1986 and 1991, Weinstein  and others conspired to violate\n\nmoney laundering and currency transaction laws in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C.   371.  Counts Two, Three and Four charged  Weinstein with\n\nvarious substantive money laundering crimes, including violations\n\nof 18 U.S.C.    1956  and 1957, as well as 31 U.S.C.    5324.  On\n\nMarch 4, 1993, Weinstein  pled guilty to Counts One  through Four\n\nof  the  indictment.    Weinstein's  guilty  pleas  were  entered\n\npursuant  to  a  plea  agreement  with the  Government  in  which\n\nWeinstein   agreed  that  he  had  in  fact  violated  the  money\n\n                               -7-\n\nlaundering statutes specified in the indictment.\n\n          The  Probation Department  then issued  its PSR,  which\n\nindicated that, based upon sentencing \"grouping\" rules, Weinstein\n\nshould  be sentenced for money  laundering, based upon his guilty\n\nplea to 18 U.S.C.    1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and (ii).3   Therefore, the\n\nbase  offense level,  as  set forth  in  U.S.S.G.    2S1.1(a)(2),\n\nshould have been 20.  The Government suggested that after a three\n\nlevel reduction for  acceptance of responsibility, as well  as an\n\nadditional two  level reduction  for his  mitigating role  in the\n\noverall  conspiracy,  the   applicable  offense  level  was   15,\n\ncorresponding to a sentencing range of 21-27 months.\n\n          On  August  5,  1993,  the  district  court   sentenced\n\nWeinstein.     The  court  departed  from  the  applicable  money\n\nlaundering  Guideline   range  because   the  court  found   that\n\nWeinstein's  behavior  essentially  constituted  bookmaking,  and\n\ntherefore  fell  outside of  the \"heartland\"  of a  typical money\n\nlaundering  offense.    The   court  instead  adopted  a  reduced\n\nsentencing  range  based  on    2E3.1, which  is  applicable  for\n\noperating an  illegal gambling business, and which  sets forth an\n\noffense level of 12 and a corresponding Guideline range of  12 to\n\n18  months'  incarceration  for  an individual  with  a  Criminal\n\nHistory Category of II.

We  quote this  memorandum  at\n\nlength,  in order to have  a complete understanding  of the basis\n\nfor the district court's decision:\n\n            Congress has empowered district courts to\n            impose a sentence  outside the  guideline\n            range  when the  court finds  \"that there\n            exists   an  aggravating   or  mitigating\n            circumstance of  a kind,  or to  a degree\n            not  adequately taken  into consideration\n            by    the   Sentencing    Commission   in\n            formulating the guidelines.\"  l8 U.S.C.  \n            3553(b);  U.S.S.G.    5K2.0.    This case\n            presents  just such  a circumstance.   It\n            involves behavior that  falls outside  of\n            the  \"heartland\"  of   a  typical   money\n            laundering offense. . . . \n\n            Here,  LeBlanc  acted  as   a  bookmaking\n            agent,   an   offense   for   which   the\n            guidelines set forth a base offense level\n            of 12.  It is difficult for this court to\n            conceive of gambling  being conducted  or\n            transacted  in  any  form  other  than by\n            money or monetary   instruments.  Yet, by\n            participating in conduct which  calls for\n            a base offense  level of 12, LeBlanc  was\n            charged  with   money  laundering,  which\n            calls  for an offense  level of 17, given\n            LeBlanc's  acceptance of  responsibility.\n            In essence, LeBlanc finds  himself facing\n            a sentence far in excess of that which is\n            commensurate with his actual conduct.\n\n            While  LeBlanc's conduct  may technically\n            constitute money laundering -- an offense\n            to which he has pled guilty -- this court\n            finds that sentencing him pursuant to the\n            strictures   of   the  money   laundering\n            statute  would  present  an inequity  not\n            adequately  taken  into consideration  by\n            the  Sentencing Commission.

Rather,  the decisions were\n\ncategorical, legal  conclusions centered on the  intent and scope\n\n                               -11-\n\nof  the money laundering statutes, and thereby, the nature of the\n\napplicable  sentencing   guideline's  heartland.    This   was  a\n\nquintessentially legal question, and  as such, subject to plenary\n\nreview.\n\n                    C.  THE DEPARTURE DECISION\n\n          We   first  review   the  district   court's  departure\n\ndecisions    to    determine   whether    the   departure-related\n\ncircumstances it relied upon to depart downward were appropriate,\n\nand  more  specifically,  whether  the  conduct  of  LeBlanc  and\n\nWeinstein  fell outside  of  the  heartland  of a  typical  money\n\nlaundering  case.    The   Government  contends  that  the  court\n\nconstrued the  scope of 18 U.S.C.    1956 much too  narrowly.  It\n\nclaims that the actions of LeBlanc and Weinstein ran afoul of the\n\nmoney  laundering  statute,  and  both so  admitted  by  pleading\n\nguilty.   Therefore, the Government argues, the court should have\n\nsentenced them pursuant to the money laundering guideline.\n\n          LeBlanc and Weinstein contend that  the court correctly\n\nconcluded  that their  cases  were atypical  of  the usual  money\n\nlaundering  case,  and  that  their illegal  conduct  was  simply\n\ngambling.   Thus,  LeBlanc  and Weinstein  argue  that the  court\n\nproperly  found that  it  would be  inequitable to  sentence them\n\npursuant  to  the  money  laundering  guideline,  and  rightfully\n\ndeparted downward.\n\n          To determine the  applicable sentence,  a court  should\n\nfirst determine the offense  guideline section most applicable to\n\nthe  offense of conviction, which is \"the offense conduct charged\n\n                               -12-\n\nin  the count of the indictment .  . . of which the defendant was\n\nconvicted.\"  U.S.S.G.    1B1.2.  Both LeBlanc and  Weinstein pled\n\nguilty to violations of 18 U.S.C.    1956 and 1957, as well as 31\n\nU.S.C.    5324.  For sentencing purposes, the operative counts in\n\nthe indictments  charged that  LeBlanc and Weinstein  violated 18\n\nU.S.C.   1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and (ii).4\n\n          To  determine   the  nature  of  the   crime  of  money\n\nlaundering, and  therefore the  scope of the  \"heartland\" of  the\n\ncorresponding  sentencing guideline,  we  look, in  part, to  the\n\nlanguage of  the statute  and the legislative  history associated\n\nwith it.  18 U.S.C.   1956 provides in pertinent part:\n\n            (a)(1) Whoever, knowing that the property\n            involved   in  a   financial  transaction\n            represents the proceeds  of some form  of\n            unlawful  activity, conducts  or attempts\n            to conduct such  a financial  transaction\n            which  in fact  involves the  proceeds of\n            specified unlawful activity -\n\n            (B)  knowing  that  the   transaction  is\n            designed in whole or in part -\n\n               (i) to conceal or disguise the nature,\n            the location, the source,  the ownership,\n            or   the  control  of   the  proceeds  of\n            specified unlawful activity; or\n\n               (ii) to avoid a  transaction reporting\n            requirement under State or Federal law, \n\n            shall be  sentenced to  a fine .  . .  or\n\n                    \n\n4  This is so  because the counts to which LeBlanc  and Weinstein\npled guilty  involved substantially the same  harm, and therefore\nthe  counts were  grouped together.   U.S.S.G.    3D1.2(d).   The\nsentencing grouping  rules mandate that a  defendant be sentenced\npursuant to the guideline section with the highest offense level.\nU.S.S.G.   3D1.3.  In this case, the applicable guideline section\nis U.S.S.G.  2S1.1(a)(2), which establishes a  base offense level\nfor laundering monetary instruments.\n\n                               -13-\n\n            imprisonment . . . or both.\n\nThis  statute was enacted as part of the Money Laundering Control\n\nAct of 1986.

LeBlanc received and  negotiated checks\n\nobtained from  illegal gambling  activities, which had  been made\n\npayable to fictitious payees.\n\n          The  district  court  suggests  that  all  LeBlanc  and\n\nWeinstein  are really guilty of  is gambling, and  that the money\n\n                    \n\n5  The  language of U.S.S.G.    2S1.1 and  the associated  policy\nstatements are  not inconsistent with this  interpretation of the\nscope of the crime of money laundering.\n\n                               -15-\n\nlaundering statutes were improperly used as an alternative method\n\nto punish this underlying  offense.  As a preliminary  matter, if\n\nthe  court did not believe that LeBlanc and Weinstein were guilty\n\nof  money laundering,  the court  should have  refused  to accept\n\ntheir guilty pleas to those offenses for lack of a factual basis.\n\nMoreover,  LeBlanc and  Weinstein did  more than  conduct illegal\n\ngambling businesses.  Both took specific  and concrete actions to\n\nlaunder  the  proceeds  from  these  gambling  activities.    The\n\ncritical financial  transactions occurred after the  gamblers had\n\nplaced  and lost  their wagers with  LeBlanc and  Weinstein, when\n\nthey then negotiated the  checks.  The court's recharacterization\n\nof the actual conduct  of LeBlanc and Weinstein ignores  the fact\n\nthat  they both  pled  guilty  to,  and  were  guilty  of,  money\n\nlaundering,  a distinct,  successor offense.   See,  e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.

Its statement that  it was \"difficult . . . to\n\nconceive of gambling  being conducted or  transacted in any  form\n\nother than by money or monetary instruments,\" and that sentencing\n\nfor money  laundering \"would present  an inequity,\"   misses  the\n\npoint.  There  was no inequity.   Leblanc  and Weinstein did  not\n\nhave to act in a manner that patently violated 18 U.S.C.   1956.\n\n          The court  erred by construing  the scope of  the money\n\nlaundering  statute,  and  the  heartland  of   its  commensurate\n\nsentencing  guideline too narrowly.   The conduct  of LeBlanc and\n\n                               -16-\n\nWeinstein  did, in fact, fall  within the \"heartland\"  of a money\n\nlaundering  case, and therefore their conduct was not of a \"kind\"\n\nthat properly justified a  downward departure.  We find  that the\n\ncourt erred by departing downward, and that LeBlanc and Weinstein\n\nshould have  been  sentenced pursuant  to the  strictures of  the\n\nmoney laundering guideline.\n\n                               -17-\n\n                      II.  LEBLANC'S APPEAL\n\n                          A.  BACKGROUND\n\n          At sentencing, LeBlanc  moved for a downward  departure\n\nfrom the Sentencing Guidelines based upon his physical condition.\n\nLeBlanc suffered his first heart attack in 1981 at the age of 34.\n\nAfter  pleading  guilty  in  the  instant  case,  while  awaiting\n\nsentencing, LeBlanc suffered a  second heart attack on  March 18,\n\n1993.\n\n          Prior  to   the  first  disposition   hearing,  LeBlanc\n\nsubmitted a medical report  to the court from his  own physician,\n\nDr. Solomon A. Gabbay.  The report stated that \"Mr. LeBlanc has a\n\n[known] history of coronary artery disease\" and that \"Mr. LeBlanc\n\nwill probably require long term therapy for his cardiac history.\"\n\nDr. Gabbay concluded:  \"[a]t this  point in time  I would  expect\n\n[LeBlanc] to require medicine for the rest of his life.\"\n\n          The  initial disposition  hearing was  held on  May 20,\n\n1993.   The court then continued  the hearing and ordered that an\n\nindependent cardiologist examine  LeBlanc, at Government expense,\n\nand report the  medical findings  to the court  to determine  the\n\nextent and seriousness of LeBlanc's cardiac problems.\n\n          A second disposition hearing was held on June 25, 1993.\n\nPursuant to the court's previous order, LeBlanc had been examined\n\nby Dr. Guy L. Reed on June 10, 1993.  Dr. Reed issued a report in\n\nwhich he stated  that LeBlanc  had coronary artery  disease.   He\n\nconcluded that LeBlanc's \"heart  disease is likely to  be largely\n\ncontrolled with medication but  he is also at risk  for recurrent\n\n                               -18-\n\nmyocardial infarction.   Because  of his coronary  artery disease\n\nand  hypercholesterolemia,  he  will  continue  to  need  ongoing\n\nmedical care indefinitely with check-ups at 4-6 month intervals.\"\n\n          After reviewing Dr. Reed's report, the court refused to\n\ngrant  LeBlanc a downward departure based on health reasons.  The\n\ncourt stated:\n\n            I  don't read  this report  as  being one\n            that  would  even  permit me,  let  alone\n            persuade me, to go beyond the guidelines.\n\n            Now,  I  would  put it  in  those  terms;\n            because,  if  I am  wrong,  then you  can\n            appeal that.  In other words, I determine\n            that this report, which we will mark as a\n            Court Exhibit,  does  not permit  me,  or\n            there is nothing  here that would  permit\n            me  to go below the guidelines.   If I am\n            wrong as a matter  of law, you can appeal\n            it, and you can come back and we will re-\n            sentence him.\n\n                    B.

Thus,  in order to  have\n                   \n\njurisdiction,   we  must   conclude  that   the   district  court\n\nmisunderstood  its  authority  to depart  under  the  guidelines.\n\nUnited States  v.

LeBlanc   contends  that  the  district  court\n\nerroneously concluded  that it was \"forbidden\"  by the guidelines\n\nto consider his heart condition as a basis for departure.   We do\n\nnot agree.  At the first disposition hearing, LeBlanc moved for a\n\ndownward  departure based  on his  heart condition  and presented\n\nsupporting evidence from  his physician, Dr.  Gabbay.  The  court\n\nthen  continued the  hearing and  ordered the  parties to  have a\n\ncourt  appointed  physician  examine  LeBlanc  to  determine  the\n\nseverity of his heart condition.   If the court had believed that\n\na downward  departure was forbidden,  it would not  have required\n\nthe parties to  engage in  the useless exercise  of obtaining  an\n\nindependent physician's opinion.   Thus, the court considered the\n\npossibility that  LeBlanc's heart condition warranted  a downward\n\ndeparture,  but  after  reviewing   the  facts,  found  that  his\n\ncondition was not serious enough to justify such a departure.\n\n          The  court correctly  understood  that a  departure for\n\n                               -20-\n\nmedical reasons was \"discouraged\"  by the guidelines.  Departures\n\nbased  upon health  problems are  \"discouraged\" and  can only  be\n\njustified if the medical problems are \"present in unusual kind or\n\ndegree\".   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rivera,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at  <span class=\"page\">948</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

However,    an\n            extraordinary physical  impairment may be\n            a reason  to impose a sentence  below the\n            applicable guideline range . . . .\n\n          Based upon the facts presented to it at sentencing, the\n\ndistrict  court did  not believe  that LeBlanc's  heart condition\n\npresented an extraordinary physical impairment within the meaning\n\nof U.S.S.G.    5H1.4 that would permit the court  to depart, much\n\nless persuade it to do so, under the Guidelines.  LeBlanc suffers\n\nfrom a  heart condition.   Both Dr.  Gabbay and Dr.  Reed stated,\n\nhowever,  that LeBlanc's  heart condition  could be  treated with\n\nmedicine.  There  was no indication in either physicians' medical\n\nreport  that LeBlanc's life  would be threatened  or shortened by\n\nvirtue  of  being  incarcerated.    Additionally,  there  was  no\n\nevidence that the Bureau of Prisons would be unable to adequately\n\naccommodate LeBlanc's medical needs.\n\n          There was  nothing in  the record which  indicated that\n\nthe  sentencing  court was  mistaken  about its  power  to depart\n\ndownward.    Rather, the  court  fully  understood its  departure\n\nability,  but concluded  that  U.S.S.G.    5H1.4  simply did  not\n\npermit departure under  the circumstances.   This was a  judgment\n\n                               -21-\n\ncall  which was supported  by the record.   As such,  the court's\n\ndeparture  decision is  not  reviewable on  appeal.
