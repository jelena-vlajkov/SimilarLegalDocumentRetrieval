Plaintiff/appellant Kimball  Hall appeals\n                \n\nthe dismissal of his complaint against  defendant/appellee R.\n\nScott Gonfrade  by the United  States District Court  for the\n\nDistrict  of Massachusetts.   We  affirm, albeit  for reasons\n\nother than those on which the district court relied.\n\n                              I\n\n     According  to the  allegations in  Hall's complaint,  on\n\nApril  5,  1989,  Hall  and his  brother  attempted  to serve\n\nGonfrade,  a  Deputy  Sheriff  of Middlesex  County,  with  a\n\nsummons and complaint stemming from Gonfrade's alleged  false\n\narrest   and  prosecution  of  Hall  in  1985.1      Gonfrade\n\nallegedly responded by assaulting  Hall's brother, seizing  a\n\ncamera  from   Hall  and   destroying  the  film,   and  then\n\nfraudulently arresting  Hall and  charging him  with assault.\n\nHall further alleges  that Gonfrade  submitted false  reports\n\nabout  the incident.   A  jury found  Hall not guilty  of the\n\nassault charge on May 11, 1990.\n\n     On April 29, 1993, Hall filed a pro se complaint against\n\nGonfrade and others.2   As amended on July 1,  the complaint,\n\nliberally  construed,  asserts  claims  against  Gonfrade for\n\nviolations of  Hall's civil rights,  pursuant to 42  U.S.C.  \n\n                    \n\n1.  Although   Hall's   complaint  contains   several  counts\nstemming from the 1985 incident, these claims are time barred\nand have not been pressed on appeal.\n\n2.  Hall  does  not appeal  the  dismissal  of the  complaint\nagainst any of the defendants except Gonfrade.\n\n1983,  for  false arrest  and malicious  prosecution stemming\n\nfrom  the 1989  incident.   He  also asserts  several pendant\n\nstate law claims.  \n\n     On  July 8, 1993, Gonfrade filed a motion to dismiss the\n\ncomplaint on  statute of  limitations grounds.   On  July 22,\n\nHall  filed a  motion  to enlarge  the  time for  filing  his\n\nopposition  to  the  motion   to  dismiss  to  and  including\n\nSeptember  16, 1993.  This  motion was granted  on August 19,\n\n1993.  Nevertheless, Hall failed to file an opposition to the\n\nmotion to dismiss.  He now asserts that he was never informed\n\nthat his motion to  extend the time for filing  an opposition\n\nhad been granted.   On November 19, 1993, the  district court\n\ngranted  the  motion  to  dismiss  on  the  ground  that  \"no\n\nopposition ha[d] been filed.\"  \n\n                              II\n\n     A litigant's \"pro  se status [does not] absolve him from\n\ncompliance  with the  Federal  Rules of  Procedure.\"   United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Heller, 957 F.2d  26, 31 (1st  Cir. 1992) (quoting\n                 \n\nFeinstein v. Moses, 951  F.2d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 1991)).  Thus,\n                  \n\npursuant to Local  Rule 7.1(B)(2), Hall was required  to file\n\nany opposition to  Gonfrade's motion to dismiss  on or before\n\nSeptember 16.  Nor can Hall  be excused from this deadline by\n\nlack  of awareness that the  court had granted  his motion to\n\nextend  the  time  for filing  his  opposition.    It is  \"an\n\nabecedarian  rule  of civil  practice  [that]  parties to  an\n\n                             -3-\n\nongoing case  have an  independent obligation to  monitor all\n\ndevelopments in  the  case and  cannot  rely on  the  clerk's\n\noffice to do  their homework for them.\"  Witty  v. Dukakis, 3\n                                                          \n\nF.3d 517, 520  (1st Cir. 1993).   Hence, when Hall  failed to\n\nrespond to the motion  to dismiss by September 16,  he waived\n\nhis right to oppose the motion.  \n\n     Nevertheless, nothing  in Local Rule 7.1  indicates that\n\nfailure  to  oppose  a  motion is  grounds  for  granting the\n\nunopposed motion.  This  court has recently held that  in the\n\ncase  of  failure to  oppose a  motion for  summary judgment,\n\n\"[t]he consequence .  . . of failing to comply  with the rule\n\nis that the party may lose the right to  file an opposition.\"\n\nMullen v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 972 F.2d 446, 451-\n                                        \n\n52  (1st  Cir.  1992) (interpreting  Local  Rule  7.1(A)(2)).\n\nHowever,  the court is still obliged  to consider whether, in\n\nlight  of the record, the  motion should be granted according\n\nto  the  appropriate  legal  standard.     See  id.  at   452\n                                                  \n\n(discussing unopposed  motion for summary judgment).   We see\n\nno reason why the rule should be any different in regard to a\n\nmotion  to dismiss.3   See also Local  Rule 7.1(F) (providing\n                               \n\n                    \n\n3.  This court's opinion in Mangual v. General Battery Corp.,\n                                                           \n710 F.2d  15  (1st Cir.  1983), is  distinguishable from  the\ninstant case.  In Mangual, the district court had ordered the\n                         \nplaintiffs to  file their opposition to the motion to dismiss\nwithin  30 days of the  completion of discovery.   It granted\nthe unopposed motion  to dismiss  only after  this order  was\nignored.   In  reviewing  the district  court decision,  this\ncourt  likewise relied on cases  in which an  action had been\ndismissed for failure to comply with a district court order.\n\n                             -4-\n\nthat motions which are  to be decided without  hearings \"will\n                                                             \n\nbe decided on the papers submitted after an opposition to the\n                                  \n\nmotion  has been filed, or  if no opposition  is filed, after\n\nthe  time for  filing an  opposition has  elapsed\") (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n     In the instant case, we agree with Gonfrade  that Hall's\n\nclaim for false arrest is time barred.  A civil rights  claim\n\npursuant to     1983 must  be brought  within the  applicable\n\nstatute of limitations period  of the state within which  the\n\nincident occurred, see  Wilson v. Garcia,  471 U.S. 261,  275\n                                        \n\n(1985), in this case, three years,  see Mass. Gen. L. c. 260,\n                                       \n\n  2A;  Street v. Vose,  936 F.2d 38,  39-40 (1st  Cir. 1991),\n                     \n\ncert. denied,  112 S.Ct. 948 (1992).   Hall's arrest occurred\n            \n\nin 1989.   Since a claim for false arrest accrues on the date\n\nof the  arrest, see, e.g., Rose v.  Bartle, 871 F.2d 331, 351\n                                          \n\n(3d Cir. 1989);  McCune v.  Grand Rapids, 842  F.2d 903,  907\n                                        \n\n(6th  Cir. 1988); Venegas v. Wagner, 704 F.2d 1144, 1146 (9th\n                                   \n\nCir. 1983); Singleton v. New York, 632 F.2d 185, 191 (2d Cir.\n                                 \n\n1980), cert. denied, 450  U.S. 920 (1981), Hall's  April 1993\n                   \n\nclaim was time barred.\n\n     Hall's claim for malicious prosecution, however, did not\n\naccrue until he was found not guilty of the assault charge in\n\nMay 1990.  See, e.g., Heck v. Humphrey, 114  S.Ct. 2364, 2371\n                                      \n\n(1994); Brummett v. Camble, 946 F.2d 1178, 1183-84  (5th Cir.\n                          \n\n1991), cert. denied, 112 S.Ct. 2323 (1992); Rose, 871 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n                             -5-\n\n348;  McCune, 842  F.2d at  907; Venegas,  704 F.2d  at 1146;\n                                        \n\nSingleton, 632 F.2d  at 198.   Hence, this  claim was  timely\n         \n\nfiled.  Nonetheless, it must be dismissed because it fails to\n\nstate  a claim for which relief can  be granted.  See Fed. R.\n                                                     \n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6).  \n\n     Malicious prosecution standing  alone does not implicate\n\nfederally protected rights.   See Torres v. Superintendent of\n                                                             \n\nPolice, 893 F.2d 404, 409 (1st Cir. 1990).  Hence, to state a\n      \n\nfederal  claim  under    1983  for  malicious prosecution,  a\n\nplaintiff must allege that  he suffered a deprivation  of his\n\nconstitutional   right  to  substantive   or  procedural  due\n\nprocess.  Id.  at 409-10.   Hall has  not alleged  sufficient\n            \n\nfacts to support a claim that he was deprived of either.\n\n     A  substantive  due  process  deprivation   must  allege\n\n\"conscience  shocking\" conduct by the defendant.   See id. at\n                                                         \n\n410.  Such conduct rarely has been found absent a plaintiff's\n\nhaving been  \"physically abused, detained,  prosecuted due to\n\nracial or political motivation or otherwise deprived of equal\n\nprotection  of the law.\"  Id. (citing cases); see also Ayala-\n                                                             \n\nMartinez v.  Anglero,  982 F.2d  26,  27-28 (1st  Cir.  1992)\n                    \n\n(affirming grant  of summary judgment where  evidence did not\n\nshow prosecution was \"for  racial or political motivation, or\n\notherwise deprived  [plaintiff]  of equal  protection\").   No\n\nsimilar conduct has been alleged by Hall.  Rather, he alleges\n\n                             -6-\n\nsimple  misuse of  the legal  process.   This alone  will not\n\nsustain a claim under   1983.4  See id.\n                                      \n\n     To support  a claim for  malicious prosecution due  to a\n\nviolation of  procedural due process, a  plaintiff must show,\n\ninter  alia, that state tort  law remedy does  not furnish an\n           \n\nadequate  remedy.  Id.   The existence of  an adequate remedy\n                     \n\nfor malicious prosecution under  Massachusetts law, see Smith\n                                                             \n\nv.  Massachusetts Dep't  of Correction,  936 F.2d  1390, 1402\n                                      \n\n(1st Cir.  1991), is fatal  to Hall's procedural  due process\n\nclaim.  \n\n     Finally, our determination that Hall has failed to plead\n\nan  actionable claim  of malicious  prosecution and  that his\n\nclaim  for false  arrest is time  barred precludes  any claim\n\nthat he  has been the  victim of a  continuing constitutional\n\nviolation.  See Perez-Ruiz, 25 F.3d at 41 n.1. \n                          \n\n     The order of the district court dismissing Hall's claims\n\nis affirmed. \n           \n\n                    \n\n4.  Moreover, the  recent Supreme  Court case of  Albright v.\n                                                          \nOliver,  114 S.Ct.  807  (1994), \"would  appear virtually  to\n      \nforeclose reliance  on substantive  due process as  the basis\nfor a viable malicious prosecution claim under section 1983.\"\nPerez-Ruiz v.

However, the court is still obliged to consider whether, in light of the record, the motion should be granted according to the appropriate legal standard.  See id. at 452 (discussing unopposed motion for summary judgment).  We see no reason why the rule should be any different in regard to a motion to dismiss.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See also Local Rule 7.1(F) (providing that motions which are to be decided without hearings \"will be decided on the papers submitted after an opposition to the motion has been filed, or if no opposition is filed, after the time for filing an opposition has elapsed\") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, we agree with Gonfrade that Hall's claim for false arrest is time barred.  A civil rights claim pursuant to Sec. 1983 must be brought within the applicable statute of limitations period of the state within which the incident occurred,  see Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 275 (1985), in this case, three years, see Mass.  Gen. L. c. 260, Sec. 2A;   Street v. Vose, 936 F.2d 38, 39-40 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S.Ct. 948 (1992).  Hall's arrest occurred in 1989.  Since a claim for false arrest accrues on the date of the arrest, see, e.g.,  Rose v. Bartle, 871 F.2d 331, 351 (3d Cir. 1989);   McCune v. Grand Rapids, 842 F.2d 903, 907 (6th Cir. 1988);   Venegas v. Wagner, 704 F.2d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir. 1983);   Singleton v. New York, 632 F.2d 185, 191 (2d Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 920 (1981), Hall's April 1993 claim was time barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall's claim for malicious prosecution, however, did not accrue until he was found not guilty of the assault charge in May 1990.  See, e.g.,  Heck v. Humphrey, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 2371 (1994);   Brummett v. Camble, 946 F.2d 1178, 1183-84 (5th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S.Ct. 2323 (1992);   Rose, 871 F.2d at 348;   McCune, 842 F.2d at 907;   Venegas, 704 F.2d at 1146;   Singleton, 632 F.2d at 198.  Hence, this claim was timely filed.  Nonetheless, it must be dismissed because it fails to state a claim for which relief can be granted.  See Fed.  R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Malicious prosecution standing alone does not implicate federally protected rights.   See Torres v. Superintendent of Police, 893 F.2d 404, 409 (1st Cir. 1990).  Hence, to state a federal claim under Sec. 1983 for malicious prosecution, a plaintiff must allege that he suffered a deprivation of his constitutional right to substantive or procedural due process.   Id. at 409-10.  Hall has not alleged sufficient facts to support a claim that he was deprived of either.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A substantive due process deprivation must allege \"conscience shocking\" conduct by the defendant.

Anglero, 982 F.2d 26, 27-28 (1st Cir. 1992) (affirming grant of summary judgment where evidence did not show prosecution was \"for racial or political motivation, or otherwise deprived [plaintiff] of equal protection\").  No similar conduct has been alleged by Hall.  Rather, he alleges simple misuse of the legal process.

Id. The existence of an adequate remedy for malicious prosecution under Massachusetts law,  see Smith v.

Scott Gonfrade by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  We affirm, albeit for reasons other than those on which the district court relied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* According to the allegations in Hall's complaint, on April 5, 1989, Hall and his brother attempted to serve Gonfrade, a Deputy Sheriff of Middlesex County, with a summons and complaint stemming from Gonfrade's alleged false arrest and prosecution of Hall in 1985.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Gonfrade allegedly responded by assaulting Hall's brother, seizing a camera from Hall and destroying the film, and then fraudulently arresting Hall and charging him with assault.  Hall further alleges that Gonfrade submitted false reports about the incident.  A jury found Hall not guilty of the assault charge on May 11, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 29, 1993, Hall filed a pro se complaint against Gonfrade and others.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  As amended on July 1, the complaint, liberally construed, asserts claims against Gonfrade for violations of Hall's civil rights, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, for false arrest and malicious prosecution stemming from the 1989 incident.  He also asserts several pendant state law claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 8, 1993, Gonfrade filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on statute of limitations grounds.  On July 22, Hall filed a motion to enlarge the time for filing his opposition to the motion to dismiss to and including September 16, 1993.  This motion was granted on August 19, 1993.  Nevertheless, Hall failed to file an opposition to the motion to dismiss.  He now asserts that he was never informed that his motion to extend the time for filing an opposition had been granted.  On November 19, 1993, the district court granted the motion to dismiss on the ground that \"no opposition ha[d] been filed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A litigant's \"pro se status [does not] absolve him from compliance with the Federal Rules of Procedure.\"   United States v.

Thus, pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(B)(2), Hall was required to file any opposition to Gonfrade's motion to dismiss on or before September 16.  Nor can Hall be excused from this deadline by lack of awareness that the court had granted his motion to extend the time for filing his opposition.  It is \"an abecedarian rule of civil practice [that] parties to an ongoing case have an independent obligation to monitor all developments in the case and cannot rely on the clerk's office to do their homework for them.\"   Witty v.

Hence, when Hall failed to respond to the motion to dismiss by September 16, he waived his right to oppose the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, nothing in Local Rule 7.1 indicates that failure to oppose a motion is grounds for granting the unopposed motion.
