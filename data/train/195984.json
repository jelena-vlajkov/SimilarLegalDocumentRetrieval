Donoghue on brief for appellant.\r                              \nDonald K. Stern, United States  Attorney, and Carole  S. Schwartz,\r                                                                             \nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per  Curiam.      Appellant,  Jorge Silva,  pleaded\r                                 \n\nguilty  to  charges of  conspiracy  to  possess cocaine  with\n\nintent to distribute and possession of cocaine with intent to\n\ndistribute.   The district court, after a  lengthy hearing on\n\nthe issue of  the amount  of cocaine that  appellant knew  or\n\nreasonably foresaw was involved  in the relevant transaction,\n\nfound  that the full nine  kilograms was attributable to him.\n\nAccordingly,  on  July 21,  1994,  it  imposed the  mandatory\n\nminimum ten-year prison sentence  prescribed by statute.  See\r                                                                         \n\n21 U.S.C.    841(b)(1)(A)(ii).  Appellant's  sole argument on\n\nappeal is that  it was clear error for the  district court to\n\nfind that  the government  proved by  a preponderance  of the\n\nevidence that  Silva knew or reasonably foresaw  that five or\n\nmore kilograms  of cocaine  were involved in  the transaction\n\nunderlying the  possession charge.  Appellant  urges that his\n\nsentence be recalculated based upon a quantity of one-to-four\n\nkilograms of cocaine.  We affirm.\n\n     The statements and findings by the district court at the\n\nsentencing hearing, as well  as the parties' briefs,  seem to\n\nassume that only the  amount of drugs that appellant  knew or\n\nreasonably foresaw  as being involved  in his conduct  can be\n\nattributed to him for  purposes of imposing mandatory minimum\n\nsentence.   See United States  v. Ekwunoh, 813  F. Supp. 168,\r                                                     \n\n178 (E.D.N.Y.  1993), vacated on  other grounds, 12  F.3d 368\r                                                           \n\n(2d Cir. 1994).  Although that argument has been presented to\r\r\n\nthis  court, we  have not  yet been  required to  resolve the\n\nissue.   See United States v. Ortiz, 23 F.3d 21, 28 (1st Cir.\r                                               \n\n1994); United States  v. Beasley,  12 F.3d 280, 285 (1st Cir.\r                                            \n\n1993).   Nor are we required to  resolve it here.  The record\n\nclearly supports a finding by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat appellant reasonably foresaw  the quantity of drugs upon\n\nwhich his sentence was based.\n\n     \"For sentencing purposes, the government must prove drug\n\nquantities by a preponderance of the evidence.\" United States\r                                                                         \n\nv.  Sepulveda, 15  F.3d  1161, 1198  (1st  Cir. 1993).    The\r                         \n\ndistrict  court's  judgment  as  to  the  quantity  of  drugs\n\nreasonably foreseen  by the  appellant will not  be disturbed\n\nunless  clearly erroneous.  See, e.g., United States v. De La\r                                                                         \n\nCruz, 996 F.2d 1307,  1314 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,     U.S.\r                                                               \n\n  , 114 S.Ct. 356  (1993).  Given that the  mandatory minimum\n\nsentence  applies so long as quantities of five grams or more\n\nare  involved, this  court  need only  determine whether  the\n\ncourt clearly  erred in attributing that amount of cocaine to\n\nSilva. See Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1200.\r                                \n\n     The  record  supports  the   court's  finding  that  the\n\ngovernment  proved by  a preponderance  of the  evidence that\n\nSilva knew or reasonably foresaw that the drug transaction in\n\nwhich  he participated  involved  five or  more kilograms  of\n\ncocaine.   Both appellant and  the government  relied at  the\n\nsentencing hearing  on transcripts  from the  trial of a  co-\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ndefendant,  Jaime  Corrales, at  which  the  sentencing judge\n\npresided.    Those  transcripts  demonstrate  that Silva  was\n\nresponsible  for  making  deliveries  of the  drugs  for  the\n\nconspirators. They further show that at some point during the\n\ntransaction, Silva  brought the bag containing nine kilograms\n\nof cocaine to  the owner of the  cocaine. From the weight  of\n\nthe  bag alone,  he could  have reasonably  foreseen  that it\n\ncontained  five or  more  kilogramos of  cocaine. See  United\r                                                                         \n\nStates  v. Ortiz, 23 F.3d at 28 (concluding that \"there would\r                            \n\nbe no basis for  finding that defendant did not  foresee that\n\nat least  five  kilograms of  cocaine  were involved  in  his\n\ncrimes\" where  the bags containing the  cocaine \"were visibly\n\nheavy\"   and  actually  contained  twenty-five  kilograms  of\n\ncocaine);  United   States  v.   Beasley,  12  F.3d   at  284\r                                                    \n\n(concluding   that  record   supported  finding   of  \"actual\n\nknowledge\"  that transaction involved  more than one kilogram\n\nof heroin  where  the suitcase  in fact  contained more  than\n\nthree  kilograms  and defendant  had  lifted  and shaken  the\n\nsuitcase.)       There being no clear  error in the  district\n\ncourt's finding  with respect  to drug  quantity, appellant's\n\nsentence is affirmed.   See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.  \r                                       \n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
