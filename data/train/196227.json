L. No.\r\n\n101-433, 104  Stat. 978,  presents two  questions  for review  on\r\n\nappeal:   a question of first  impression as to  the operation of\r\n\nthe OWBPA's nonretroactivity provision; and  a situation-specific\r\n\nquestion concerning justiciability.   The district court resolved\r\n\nboth of these  questions in  the defendants' favor.   It  entered\r\n\nsummary judgment  against a pair of  plaintiffs, determining that\r\n\nthe  OWBPA did  not  apply to  their  claims, and  simultaneously\r\n\ndismissed the third  plaintiff's claim  as unripe.   See Riva  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nCommonwealth of  Mass.,  871 F.  Supp.  1511, 1517-20  (D.  Mass.\r                                \r\n\n1994).   We affirm the  summary judgment ruling,  but reverse the\r\n\ndismissal  of  the remaining  plaintiff's  claim  and remand  for\r\n\nfurther proceedings.\r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r                                           \r\n\n                            The OWBPA\r                                      The OWBPA\r\n\n          Congress enacted the ADEA in 1967 to prohibit age-based\r\n\ndiscrimination  in the  \"terms,  conditions,  or  privileges\"  of\r\n\nemployment.  29 U.S.C.   623(a).  The law originally contained an\r\n\nexclusion for employee benefit  plans, providing that an employer\r\n\ncould  continue to  \"observe the  terms of  . .  . any  bona fide\r\n\nemployee benefit plan such as a retirement, pension, or insurance\r\n\nplan, which is not a subterfuge to evade [ADEA's] purposes.\"  Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n   623(f)(2).   The Department  of Labor,  and, later,  the Equal\r\n\nEmployment  Opportunity  Commission   (EEOC),  interpreted   this\r\n\nprovision to require that age-based distinctions in benefit plans\r\n\nbe  cost-justified in  order to  qualify for  the shelter  of the\r\n\nexclusion.  See 29 C.F.R.   1625.10 (1988).  When confronted with\r                         \r\n\nthe issue,  the Supreme Court  expanded the safe haven.   It held\r\n\nthat, under the ADEA, an employee challenging a benefit plan must\r\n\nprove  that  \"the  discriminatory  plan  provision  actually  was\r\n\nintended  to serve  the purpose  of discriminating  in some  non-\r\n\nfringe-benefit  aspect  of  the  employment  relation.\"    Public\r                                                                           \r\n\nEmployees Ret. Sys. v. Betts, 492 U.S. 158, 181 (1989).\r                                      \r\n\n          On  October 16,  1990, Congress  enacted the  OWBPA and\r\n\nthus reconfigured the exclusion.   The amendments placed employee\r\n\nbenefits  squarely within  the  protective custody  of the  ADEA,\r\n\noverturned Betts, and reinstated  the earlier view that age-based\r                          \r\n\ndistinctions  in  employee   benefits  must  be   cost-justified.\r\n\nRecognizing  the  potential  implications  of these  changes  for\r\n\npublic employers,  Congress stipulated  that the OWBPA  would not\r\n\ntake effect  as to states and their  political subdivisions until\r\n\ntwo years after its passage.   See OWBPA   105(c).   Moreover, in\r                                            \r\n\ngrappling with  the question  of retroactivity, Congress  decreed\r\n\nthat the OWBPA  would not apply  at all to  \"a series of  benefit\r\n\npayments made to an individual or the individual's representative\r\n\nthat  began prior to the  effective date and  that continue after\r\n\nthe  effective date pursuant to an arrangement that was in effect\r\n\non the effective date . . . . \"  Id.   105(e).\r                                              \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r                                           \r\n\n         The Commonwealth's Disability Retirement Scheme\r                   The Commonwealth's Disability Retirement Scheme\r\n\n          In Massachusetts, public  employees who are injured  on\r\n\nthe job  and  cannot  continue working  may  retire  and  receive\r\n\naccidental disability  benefits.  See Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 32,    7\r\n\n(1989).   Ordinarily, the amount  of an employee's  benefits will\r\n\nequal roughly  72% of her previous wages.  See id.   7(2)(a)(ii).\r                                                            \r\n\nBut there  is a rub:   section  7(2)(b ), added in  1987, affords\r\n\nsignificantly  different treatment  for employees  who have  less\r\n\nthan  ten years  of creditable  service and  who are at  least 55\r\n\nyears old at the time  of accidental disability retirement. Under\r\n\nsection 7(2)(b ), an employee  who fits this description receives\r\n\nher regular  disability retirement  benefits until she  turns 65,\r\n\nbut her benefits are then refigured to equal the amount she would\r\n\nhave received  if she  retired on  superannuation,  i.e., if  she\r                                                                  \r\n\nretired based on age and years of service.1\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1As amended, the statute provides in relevant part:\r\n\n          The  normal yearly amount of the allowance of\r\n          any  member retired  under the  provisions of\r\n          this  section . . .  who at the  time of such\r\n          retirement had attained the age of fifty-five\r\n          and who  at the  time of such  retirement had\r\n          accrued  fewer than  ten years  of creditable\r\n          service shall be adjusted  on the last day of\r\n          the  month in  which  he attains  the age  of\r\n          sixty-five  to  that  to  which he  would  be\r\n          entitled . . .  if he were to be  retired for\r\n          superannuation  upon  the  attainment of  age\r\n          sixty-five . . . . \r\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 32,   7(2)(b ) (1989).\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n                               III.\r                                         III.\r                                            \r\n\n                          The Plaintiffs\r                                    The Plaintiffs\r\n\n          Albert Riva  commenced his employment with  the City of\r\n\nBoston  in August  of 1982.   He retired  in April  of 1992 after\r\n\nexperiencing  a permanently disabling injury.  At the time of his\r\n\nretirement, Riva  had not  yet accrued  ten  years of  creditable\r\n\nservice.  On August  19, 1992, the Boston Retirement  Board (BRB)\r\n\ntransmitted  a letter advising him that his benefits were subject\r\n\nto  reduction under  section  7(2)(b ).   Approximately one  year\r\n\nlater, after  Riva had  celebrated his sixty-fifth  birthday, the\r\n\nBoard  implemented  the  law  and reduced  Riva's  benefits  from\r\n\napproximately $2,130 per month to approximately $775 per month.\r\n\n          Nancy Pentland was employed by the Town of Andover from\r\n\nFebruary  of  1981  until  she  retired  due   to  a  job-related\r\n\ndisability  on November 30, 1988.  At the time of her retirement,\r\n\nshe  was  61 years  old  but had  not  yet accrued  ten  years of\r\n\ncreditable  service.    As  of  October  31,  1992,  the  Andover\r\n\nRetirement Board (ARB) recalculated her benefits according to the\r\n\nsuperannuation  guidelines, resulting in a substantial downsizing\r\n\nof her monthly stipend. \r\n\n          Robert Keenan toiled as  a Boston school custodian from\r\n\nDecember of 1989 until  March of 1991.  At the  age of 56, having\r\n\nless  than  ten  years  of  creditable  service,  he  retired  on\r\n\naccidental  disability  and began  receiving a  monthly allowance\r\n\neffective February 20, 1993.  On June 22,  1994, the BRB notified\r\n\nhim of the  prospective applicability of section 7(2)(b )  to his\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\ncase.  Keenan was born on August 10, 1937, so his monthly benefit\r\n\nis  not  scheduled  to  be  recalculated  until  the  year  2002.\r\n\nNonetheless, subscribing to the adage that an ounce of prevention\r\n\nis  sometimes worth a pound  of cure, he  (like Riva and Pentland\r\n\nbefore him) filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC.\r\n\n          It  is significant  that, when  the OWBPA  took effect,\r\n\nboth  Riva  and  Pentland   were  already  receiving   disability\r\n\nretirement benefits, but Keenan    whose retirement postdated the\r\n\nstatute's effective date   was not.\r\n\n                               IV.\r                                         IV.\r                                           \r\n\n                          The Litigation\r                                    The Litigation\r\n\n          Riva and Pentland commenced the instant action against,\r\n\ninter   alia,  the  Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts,  the  Public\r                      \r\n\nEmployee  Retirement  Administration,  the   BRB,  and  the   ARB\r\n\n(collectively,  \"the  Commonwealth\").    Their  complaint  sought\r\n\ndeclaratory, injunctive, and  compensatory relief, alleging  that\r\n\nthe   Massachusetts   accidental  disability   retirement  scheme\r\n\nviolated the  OWBPA  because it  arbitrarily  reduced  retirement\r\n\nbenefits  based on  the  recipient's age.2   Keenan  subsequently\r\n\njoined the suit as an additional plaintiff.\r\n\n          The  parties   cross-moved  for  summary   judgment  on\r\n\nstipulated facts.  The  district court granted brevis disposition\r                                                               \r\n\nin  the Commonwealth's  favor  vis-a-vis Riva  and Pentland,  and\r                                                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The  complaint also  included two  claims for  relief under\r\nstate  anti-discrimination  laws.    Both of  these  claims  were\r\ndismissed  on the plaintiffs' motion, and have no bearing on this\r\nappeal.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\ndismissed Keenan's claim as  unripe.  See  Riva, 871 F. Supp.  at\r                                                         \r\n\n1517-20.   The court ruled that even though Riva's and Pentland's\r\n\nbenefits were recalculated after the effective date of  the OWBPA\r\n\n(when they reached age 65), the smaller payments were of the same\r\n\nclass as the  original payments, were part of a  single series of\r\n\nbenefit payments that straddled the effective date, and were paid\r\n\npursuant to  a preexisting arrangement.  See id. at 1519.  Hence,\r                                                          \r\n\nsection   105(e)  applied,   and  the   Massachusetts  disability\r\n\nretirement scheme,  as it  affected those plaintiffs,  eluded the\r\n\nOWBPA's grasp.  See id.\r                                 \r\n\n          Keenan's case  easily vaults this hurdle.   Unlike Riva\r\n\nand Pentland, he began receiving benefit payments only  after the\r\n\nOWBPA  had become fully effective.  Thus,  his claim does not fit\r\n\nwithin  the confines  of section  105(e).   In the  trial court's\r\n\nview,  however, a  different obstacle  loomed.   Because Keenan's\r\n\nbenefits  were  not  scheduled to  be  pared  for several  years,\r\n\nKeenan's  alleged injury  was  both remote  and contingent,  and,\r\n\naccordingly, his  claim was  unripe.

Applying  these  tenets, we  find  that section  105(e)\r\n\nunambiguously excludes  Pentland's benefits from  the application\r\n\nof the OWBPA.\r\n\n          As previously noted, Congress exempted from the OWBPA's\r\n\ngrasp any \"series  of benefit payments . . .  that began prior to\r\n\n[OWBPA's] effective  date and  that continue after  the effective\r\n\ndate  pursuant  to  an arrangement  that  was  in  effect on  the\r\n\neffective date  .  . .  .  \"   OWBPA    105(e).   A  \"series\"  is\r\n\nroutinely defined as \"a  group of usu[ally] three or  more things\r\n\nor  events  standing or  succeeding in  order  and having  a like\r\n\nrelationship to  each other.\"  Webster's  Third New International\r                                                                           \r\n\nDictionary  2073 (1986);  accord Webster's  Ninth New  Collegiate\r                                                                           \r\n\nDictionary 1074 (1989) (defining series  to include \"a number  of\r                    \r\n\nthings or events of  the same class coming  one after another  in\r\n\nspatial or temporal succession\");  The Random House Dictionary of\r                                                                           \r\n\nthe English  Language  1748 (2d  ed.  1987) (defining  series  to\r                               \r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\ninclude  \"a group  or  a number  of  related or  similar  things,\r\n\nevents,  etc., arranged  or  occurring in  temporal, spatial,  or\r\n\nother   order   or   succession\").4     Consistent   with   these\r\n\ndefinitions,  all the benefit payments  to Pentland form a single\r\n\n\"series\" as that word is used in section 105(e).\r\n\n          The  like  relationship  of  the  payments  is  readily\r\n\napparent.     The  disbursements,  both  before   and  after  the\r\n\nrecalculation, form a continuing stream of monthly payments, made\r\n\non account of the same disability, and determined at the  time of\r\n\ninception under the same statutory scheme.  What is more, the ARB\r\n\nbegan to pay  these serial benefits before  the OWBPA's effective\r\n\ndate, continued to pay them afterwards, and did so pursuant to an\r\n\narrangement   the payment scheme established in the Massachusetts\r\n\nstatute   that was in full flower when the OWBPA took effect.\r\n\n          To  be  sure,  the  size of  Pentland's  monthly  check\r\n\ndiminished  when she turned 65, but her argument that the reduced\r\n\nbenefits comprise a  new \"series\" because her payments  were then\r\n\nrecalculated on the basis of  the superannuation tables is belied\r\n\nby the  text of the  Massachusetts statute.   It directs  that an\r\n\naffected  individual's benefits  shall  be adjusted  \"to that  to\r\n\nwhich [s]he  would be entitled  under the  [statutory scheme]  if\r\n\n[s]he were to be retired for superannuation.\"   Mass. Gen. L. ch.\r\n\n32,   7(2)(b ).  This language makes it transpicuously clear that\r\n\nPentland has  continuously received the  same kind of  benefits  \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4Courts are  free to use standard  dictionary definitions to\r\nassist in determining the ordinary meaning of statutory language.\r\nSee, e.g., FDIC v. Meyer, 114 S. Ct. 996, 1001 (1994).\r                                  \r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\naccidental disability retirement benefits   both before and after\r\n\nthe  OWBPA's  effective date.   Only  the  amount of  the monthly\r\n\nstipend,  not  the  nature  of  the  payments,  changed when  she\r\n\nattained age 65.\r\n\n          At  the expense of  carting coals to  Newcastle, we add\r\n\nthat appellants' interpretation of  a \"series\" as comprising, for\r\n\nall intents and  purposes, a  \"sequence of  identical items,\"  is\r\n\nprofoundly flawed.   To read section 105(e) in this  way would be\r\n\ntotally at odds with ordinary usage and,  moreover, would lead to\r\n\nabsurd results.  Carried  to its logical extreme, such  a reading\r\n\nwould  gut the  exemption  by rendering  it  inapplicable to  any\r\n\nstream of benefits that changed after the OWBPA's  effective date\r\n\nby  reference to  an  external  source.    Thus,  even  the  most\r\n\ncommonplace adjustments (such as cost-of-living  increases) would\r\n\nserve  to defeat the exemption.  We cannot conceive of any reason\r\n\nwhy Congress   which patently believed that employers should have\r\n\na substantial degree  of protection against the application  of a\r\n\nnew  rule to payment protocols already in use to sustain existing\r\n\npayment  schemes    would  have desired  to  take so  quixotic  a\r\n\nposition.\r\n\n          Section   105(e)'s   reference    to   a    preexisting\r\n\n\"arrangement\"  is equally  unhelpful to  Pentland's quest.   Both\r\n\nsection 7(2)(b ) and the  relevant superannuation guidelines were\r\n\nin existence at the  time that the ARB started  paying Pentland's\r\n\nretirement  benefits,  and  the  parties have  not  directed  our\r\n\nattention  to any  subsequent changes  in either  provision which\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nmight  support  a  finding  that  the  Commonwealth  put  a fresh\r\n\n\"arrangement\" into  effect.   In Pentland's case,  therefore, the\r\n\nentire stream of  benefit payments  has been (and  will be)  made\r\n\npursuant  to a single arrangement that was crafted in whole prior\r\n\nto  the OWBPA's  effective  date.   Consequently, section  105(e)\r\n\napplies unreservedly.\r\n\n          Although the plain language  of section 105(e)  carries\r\n\nthe  day  and obviates  any need  for  a detailed  examination of\r\n\nextrinsic  sources,  we  note  in passing  that  the  legislative\r\n\nhistory  of the  OWBPA strongly  suggests that  Congress intended\r\n\nprecisely   the  result  that   follows  from  a  straightforward\r\n\nrendering of section 105(e)'s plain language.  The original draft\r\n\nof  the  bill, submitted  to the  Senate  on September  17, 1990,\r\n\ncontemplated that  the OWBPA provisions on  which Pentland relies\r\n\nwould  apply retrospectively.  See 136 Cong. Rec. S13, 237 (daily\r                                            \r\n\ned. Sept. 17,  1990).  This  approach provoked stout  opposition,\r\n\nand  section 105(e) emerged as a  compromise.  See 136 Cong. Rec.\r                                                            \r\n\nS13,603 (daily  ed. Sept. 24, 1990).  In responding to a question\r\n\nabout  the  truncated  version  of  the  nonretroactivity clause,\r\n\nSenator Pryor, chairman of  the Special Committee on Aging  and a\r\n\nprime  sponsor of  the legislation,  indicated that  the drafters\r\n\nintended, through the  compromise, to ensure that the OWBPA would\r\n\nreach benefits  that were  discriminatorily structured  after the\r\n\napplicable  effective date,  leaving  other benefits  unaffected.\r\n\nSee  id. at S13,609.  Senator Metzenbaum, whose original bill, as\r                  \r\n\nwe  have said,  featured broad  retroactivity, concurred  in this\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\ninterpretation of  the compromise language.5  So  did another key\r\n\nsupporter, Senator Hatch.6\r\n\n          In sum, it appears  virtually certain that Congress did\r\n\nnot  intend  the   OWBPA  to  apply  to  benefit  payments,  like\r\n\nPentland's,  which were  structured  and commenced  prior to  the\r\n\neffective date  of the neoteric legislation.  The comments relied\r\n\non  by the  appellants  in  urging  an  opposite  view     mainly\r\n\nstatements  by legislators  who expressed  their desire  to avoid\r\n\n\"disruptions\" in ongoing benefits, such as the remarks of Senator\r\n\nHatch, quoted supra note 6    are more plausibly read as  wishing\r                             \r\n\nto  avoid  displacements that  would  be  caused by  wide-ranging\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Senator Metzenbaum stated:\r\n\n          We  also  clarify  the effective  date  as it\r\n          relates to a stream of benefit  payments made\r\n          to  an individual  that  began  prior to  the\r\n          effective  date.   We  exempt such  a benefit\r\n          stream  from  the requirements  of  the bill,\r\n          provided that the  employer has not initiated\r\n          the  stream pursuant  to a  modification made\r\n          after the  date of enactment, with the intent\r\n          to evade the purposes of the bill.\r\n\n136 Cong. Rec. S13,598 (daily ed. Sept. 24, 1990).\r\n\n     6Senator Hatch  voiced his concern that,  under the original\r\nversion, \"all the  new requirements would  be applied to  ongoing\r\nbenefit payments  that began  before the bill's  effective date.\"\r\n136 Cong.  Rec. S13,600 (daily ed.  Sept. 24, 1990).   Because he\r\nfeared this result, Senator Hatch concluded that \"it was critical\r\nto  amend  the  bill  to  remove  the  possibility  that  current\r\nrecipients of  [disability,  severance and  retirement]  benefits\r\ncould suffer disruptions in their payments.\"  Id.  He assured his\r                                                           \r\nfellow  solons  that \"[t]he  compromise\"  embodied  in the  final\r\nversion of  the bill  ensured \"that  ongoing benefit  payments to\r\nindividuals  that began prior to  the effective date  of the bill\r\nwill not be affected by this  legislation.\"  Id.; see also id. at\r                                                                        \r\nS13,607 (similar; statement of Sen. Grassley).\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nretroactive application of the  OWBPA rather than as guaranteeing\r\n\nlevel  benefit  rates, regardless  of  the  circumstances, or  as\r\n\ndisfavoring  changes  in  benefits  compelled  by  the  unamended\r\n\noperation of preexisting retirement schemes.\r\n\n          We  have exhausted this  issue.   To conclude,  we hold\r\n\nthat a stream  of benefits does not become a  new \"series\" in the\r\n\ncontemplation  of  OWBPA     105(e) simply  because  the  monthly\r\n\nbenefit amount  is adjusted  by reference to  an external  source\r\n\npursuant to  a directive contained in  a preexisting arrangement.\r\n\nRiva and Pentland are, therefore, fishing in an empty pond.\r\n\n                               VII.\r                                         VII.\r                                            \r\n\n                      The Ripeness Paradigm\r                                The Ripeness Paradigm\r                                                     \r\n\n          We  turn now  to  the more  vexing  of the  two  issues\r\n\npresented  in  this  appeal.   Since  section  7(2)(b )  will not\r\n\ndirectly  affect  Keenan's  stipend  until  the  year  2002,  the\r\n\ndistrict  court determined  that  his claim  lacked the  ripeness\r\n\nnecessary  to confer justiciability.   See Riva, 871  F. Supp. at\r                                                         \r\n\n1517-18.   Before  evaluating  this determination,  we scout  the\r\n\nlegal landscape.   \r\n\n          When  a  litigant   seeks  relief  that   is  primarily\r\n\nprospective  in  character,  questions of  ripeness  are analyzed\r\n\nunder  a familiar  framework that  considers the  fitness  of the\r\n\nissue for  immediate  review and  the  hardship to  the  litigant\r\n\nshould review be postponed.  See Abbott Labs v. Gardner, 387 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n136,  148-49 (1967); Ernst &amp; Young, 45  F.3d at 535.

For  example,  even  when  the  direct\r\n\napplication  of a statute  is open to  a charge  of remoteness by\r\n\nreason of a lengthy, built-in time delay before the statute takes\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\neffect,  ripeness may be found as long as the statute's operation\r\n\nis  inevitable (or nearly so).   See, e.g.,  Regional Rail Reorg.\r                                                                           \r\n\nAct Cases,  419  U.S. 102,  142-43 (1974).   And,  even when  the\r                   \r\n\ndirect application of such a statute is subject to some degree of\r\n\ncontingency,   the  statute   may  impose   sufficiently  serious\r\n\ncollateral  injuries  that  an  inquiring  court  will  deem  the\r\n\nhardship  component satisfied.   See  Erwin  Chemerinsky, Federal\r                                                                           \r\n\nJurisdiction     2.4.2, at  121-22 (2d  ed.  1994).

See, e.g., Pacific\r                                                                           \r\n\nGas,  461 U.S. at  201; Duke Power  Co. v.  Carolina Envtl.

We caution,  however,\r                     \r\n\nthat in such murky waters generalizations  are dangerous, and the\r\n\nweighing  of collateral effects is  for the most  part a judgment\r\n\ncall, to be made case by case.\r\n\n                              VIII.\r                                        VIII.\r                                            \r\n\n                      Applying the Paradigm\r                                Applying the Paradigm\r                                                     \r\n\n          Viewed against this backdrop,  we think that Keenan has\r\n\nmade  a satisfactory showing under both prongs of the Abbott Labs\r                                                                           \r\n\nparadigm.    Given  the   relative  certainty  of  the  statute's\r\n\napplication,  the  purity  of  the  legal  issue  presented,  the\r\n\npresence of all necessary  parties before the court,  the dilemma\r\n\nthat Keenan  currently  faces, and  the  hardship to  him  should\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nimmediate  review be denied, we  conclude that he  has advanced a\r\n\nripe claim.\r\n\n          The paramount  harm to Keenan    the eventual reduction\r\n\nin  his benefits  pursuant to  section 7(2)(b )    is  distant in\r\n\ntime, but its incidence seems highly probable.   The Commonwealth\r\n\nhas pointed  to three contingencies that might shield Keenan from\r\n\nultimate harm  of this kind: (1) he might die before reaching age\r\n\n65, (2)  he might no longer be disabled when he reaches that age,\r\n\nor (3)  the challenged  statute might  be amended  prior thereto.\r\n\nThere  is no evidence in the record  to suggest that any of these\r\n\nthree contingencies are likely to eventuate.  The life expectancy\r\n\nof a man in his mid-50s is  roughly 20 years.  See, e.g.,  United\r                                                                  \r\n\nStates  Bureau of the Census,  Statistical Abstract of the United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates:   1994 Table 116, at 88 (114th ed.); Keenan's disability,\r                        \r\n\naccording  to state law, is permanent and total, see, e.g., Mass.\r                                                                    \r\n\nGen.

The demise of a party or\r\n\nthe repeal  of a statute will  always be possible in  any case of\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\ndelayed  enforcement, yet it is  well settled that  a time delay,\r\n\nwithout more,  will not  render a  claim of  statutory invalidity\r\n\nunripe   if  the   application  of   the  statute   is  otherwise\r\n\nsufficiently  probable.

The  degree  of  contingency  is  an  important\r\n\nbarometer of ripeness in  this respect.

Here, the  relative  certainty  of\r\n\nKeenan's asserted injury indicates that his claim is suitable for\r\n\ncontemporaneous judicial review.\r\n\n          Three other circumstances buttress the  conclusion that\r\n\nKeenan's claim is ready for adjudication.  In the first place, he\r\n\nmounts  a facial  challenge to the  state law,  and does  so on a\r\n\nstipulated record.  Thus, his claim is unabashedly legal, and the\r\n\ndistrict court is capable of resolving it with no further factual\r\n\nexposition.   Second, and relatedly, the  controversy is narrowly\r\n\ndefined  and  is  susceptible  to specific  relief,  adequate  to\r\n\nconclude  the  matter,   without  speculation  or  reference   to\r\n\nhypothetical  facts,  and  without  much risk  that  the  court's\r\n\nopinion  will prove superfluous.  Last but not least, the case is\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\nfully adverse; all the proper parties are before the court.\r\n\n          We  are equally  convinced  that allowing  the case  to\r\n\nproceed, here and now, would serve a useful purpose, and would be\r\n\nof great practical assistance to all concerned.

See id. at  905-06.

So it is here:  a ripeness analysis\r\n\ncan take  into account not  only the  harm that  arises from  the\r\n\nreduced  value of Keenan's benefits,  but also the  harm from the\r\n\nstate's  possible  endorsement  of  age  discrimination  and  the\r\n\nprejudice that underlies it.\r\n\n          Moreover, the uncertainty about the validity of section\r\n\n7(2)(b ) is also imposing a present hardship on Keenan apart from\r\n\nthe specter of  reduced future benefits.  At  age 58, people must\r\n\nnail  down their  plans for  financial security  in  their golden\r\n\nyears.  Thus, the most immediate harm to Keenan comes in the form\r\n\nof  an inability  prudently to  arrange his  fiscal affairs.   If\r\n\nKeenan anticipates that  his benefits  will not  be reduced,  and\r\n\nguesses  wrong,  he may  find  himself  inadequately prepared  to\r\n\nsubsist on the unwanted birthday  present   a drastically reduced\r\n\npension     that  will  accompany  his  attainment  of  age   65.\r\n\nConversely, if  he anticipates that  the statute will  be upheld,\r\n\nand  guesses wrong,  he  may needlessly  deprive  himself in  the\r\n\nintervening seven  years, preparing  for a  rainy day that  never\r\n\ndawns.  We believe that  this uncertainty and the  considerations\r\n\nof utility that we have mentioned coalesce to show that Keenan is\r\n\nsuffering a sufficient present injury to satisfy the second prong\r\n\nof the Abbott Labs paradigm.

Secs. 621-634 (1988), as amended by the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA), Pub.L. No. 101-433, 104 Stat. 978, presents two questions for review on appeal:  a question of first impression as to the operation of the OWBPA's nonretroactivity provision;  and a situation-specific question concerning justiciability.  The district court resolved both of these questions in the defendants' favor.  It entered summary judgment against a pair of plaintiffs, determining that the OWBPA did not apply to their claims, and simultaneously dismissed the third plaintiff's claim as unripe.  See Riva v. Commonwealth of Mass., 871 F.Supp. 1511, 1517-20 (D.Mass.1994).  We affirm the summary judgment ruling, but reverse the dismissal of the remaining plaintiff's claim and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>The OWBPA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress enacted the ADEA in 1967 to prohibit age-based discrimination in the \"terms, conditions, or privileges\" of employment.  29 U.S.C. Sec. 623(a).  The law originally contained an exclusion for employee benefit plans, providing that an employer could continue to \"observe the terms of ... any bona fide employee benefit plan such as a retirement, pension, or insurance plan, which is not a subterfuge to evade [ADEA's] purposes.\"   Id. Sec. 623(f)(2).  The Department of Labor, and, later, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), interpreted this provision to require that age-based distinctions in benefit plans be cost-justified in order to qualify for the shelter of the exclusion.  See 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1625.10 (1988).  When confronted with the issue, the Supreme Court expanded the safe haven.  It held that, under the ADEA, an employee challenging a benefit plan must prove that \"the discriminatory plan provision actually was intended to serve the purpose of discriminating in some non-fringe-benefit aspect of the employment relation.\"  Public Employees Ret.  Sys. v. Betts, 492 U.S. 158, 181, 109 S.Ct. 2854, 2868, 106 L.Ed.2d 134 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 16, 1990, Congress enacted the OWBPA and thus reconfigured the exclusion.  The amendments placed employee benefits squarely within the protective custody of the ADEA, overturned Betts, and reinstated the earlier view that age-based distinctions in employee benefits must be cost-justified.  Recognizing the potential implications of these changes for public employers, Congress stipulated that the OWBPA would not take effect as to states and their political subdivisions until two years after its passage.  See OWBPA Sec. 105(c).  Moreover, in grappling with the question of retroactivity, Congress decreed that the OWBPA would not apply at all to \"a series of benefit payments made to an individual or the individual's representative that began prior to the effective date and that continue after the effective date pursuant to an arrangement that was in effect on the effective date....\"  Id. Sec. 105(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>The Commonwealth's Disability Retirement Scheme</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Massachusetts, public employees who are injured on the job and cannot continue working may retire and receive accidental disability benefits.  See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 32, Sec. 7 (1989).  Ordinarily, the amount of an employee's benefits will equal roughly 72% of her previous wages.  See id. Sec. 7(2)(a)(ii).  But there is a rub:  section 7(2)(b 1/2), added in 1987, affords significantly different treatment for employees who have less than ten years of creditable service and who are at least 55 years old at the time of accidental disability retirement.  Under section 7(2)(b 1/2), an employee who fits this description receives her regular disability retirement benefits until she turns 65, but her benefits are then refigured to equal the amount she would have received if she retired on superannuation, i.e., if she retired based on age and years of service.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>The Plaintiffs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Albert Riva commenced his employment with the City of Boston in August of 1982.  He retired in April of 1992 after experiencing a permanently disabling injury.  At the time of his retirement, Riva had not yet accrued ten years of creditable service.  On August 19, 1992, the Boston Retirement Board (BRB) transmitted a letter advising him that his benefits were subject to reduction under section 7(2)(b 1/2).  Approximately one year later, after Riva had celebrated his sixty-fifth birthday, the Board implemented the law and reduced Riva's benefits from approximately $2,130 per month to approximately $775 per month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nancy Pentland was employed by the Town of Andover from February of 1981 until she retired due to a job-related disability on November 30, 1988.  At the time of her retirement, she was 61 years old but had not yet accrued ten years of creditable service.  As of October 31, 1992, the Andover Retirement Board (ARB) recalculated her benefits according to the superannuation guidelines, resulting in a substantial downsizing of her monthly stipend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robert Keenan toiled as a Boston school custodian from December of 1989 until March of 1991.  At the age of 56, having less than ten years of creditable service, he retired on accidental disability and began receiving a monthly allowance effective February 20, 1993.  On June 22, 1994, the BRB notified him of the prospective applicability of section 7(2)(b 1/2) to his case.  Keenan was born on August 10, 1937, so his monthly benefit is not scheduled to be recalculated until the year 2002.  Nonetheless, subscribing to the adage that an ounce of prevention is sometimes worth a pound of cure, he (like Riva and Pentland before him) filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is significant that, when the OWBPA took effect, both Riva and Pentland were already receiving disability retirement benefits, but Keenan--whose retirement postdated the statute's effective date--was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>The Litigation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riva and Pentland commenced the instant action against, inter alia, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Public Employee Retirement Administration, the BRB, and the ARB (collectively, \"the Commonwealth\").  Their complaint sought declaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief, alleging that the Massachusetts accidental disability retirement scheme violated the OWBPA because it arbitrarily reduced retirement benefits based on the recipient's age.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Keenan subsequently joined the suit as an additional plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties cross-moved for summary judgment on stipulated facts.  The district court granted brevis disposition in the Commonwealth's favor vis-a-vis Riva and Pentland, and dismissed Keenan's claim as unripe.  See Riva, 871 F.Supp. at 1517-20.   The court ruled that even though Riva's and Pentland's benefits were recalculated after the effective date of the OWBPA (when they reached age 65), the smaller payments were of the same class as the original payments, were part of a single series of benefit payments that straddled the effective date, and were paid pursuant to a preexisting arrangement.  See id. at 1519.   Hence, section 105(e) applied, and the Massachusetts disability retirement scheme, as it affected those plaintiffs, eluded the OWBPA's grasp.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keenan's case easily vaults this hurdle.  Unlike Riva and Pentland, he began receiving benefit payments only after the OWBPA had become fully effective.  Thus, his claim does not fit within the confines of section 105(e).  In the trial court's view, however, a different obstacle loomed.  Because Keenan's benefits were not scheduled to be pared for several years, Keenan's alleged injury was both remote and contingent, and, accordingly, his claim was unripe.  See id. at 1517-18.   All three plaintiffs now appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <p>Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's resolution of a question of statutory interpretation engenders de novo review in the court of appeals.  See Pritzker v. Yari, 42 F.3d 53, 65 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1959, 131 L.Ed.2d 851 (1995);  United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 472 (1st Cir.1994).  This standard of review applies to the district court's application of section 105(e) to the facts stipulated in the instant case.  By the same token, a trial court's determination on a paper record that the case before it lacks ripeness presents a question of law subject to plenary review.  See Ernst &amp; Young v. Depositors Economic Protection Corp., 45 F.3d 530, 534 (1st Cir.1995);  Shea v. Rev-Lyn Contracting Co., 868 F.2d 515, 517 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <p>The Exemption</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Riva and Pentland began receiving disability retirement benefits prior to the effective date of the OWBPA, and their benefits were reduced pursuant to section 7(2)(b 1/2) after the effective date.  For the reasons that follow, we think that the payment stream is exempt from scrutiny under the federal statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with a prosaic precept:  \"In a statutory construction case, the beginning point must be the language of the statute, and when a statute speaks with clarity to an issue judicial inquiry into the statute's meaning, in all but the most extraordinary circumstance, is finished.\"  Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U.S. 469, 474-76, 112 S.Ct. 2589, 2594, 120 L.Ed.2d 379 (1992).  In other words, the court need not consult legislative history and other aids to statutory construction when the words of the statute neither create an ambiguity nor lead to an unreasonable interpretation.  See United States v. Charles George Trucking Co., 823 F.2d 685, 688 (1st Cir.1987).  In searching a statute's text for a pellucid expression of congressional intent, we attribute to words that are not defined in the statute itself their ordinary usage, see Baez v. INS, 41 F.3d 19, 24 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2608, 132 L.Ed.2d 853 (1995), and make a commonsense concession that meaning can only be ascribed to statutory language if that language is taken in context, see King v. St. Vincent's Hosp., 502 U.S. 215, 221, 112 S.Ct. 570, 574, 116 L.Ed.2d 578 (1991).  Applying these tenets, we find that section 105(e) unambiguously excludes Pentland's benefits from the application of the OWBPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously noted, Congress exempted from the OWBPA's grasp any \"series of benefit payments ... that began prior to [OWBPA's] effective date and that continue after the effective date pursuant to an arrangement that was in effect on the effective date....\"  OWBPA Sec. 105(e).  A \"series\" is routinely defined as \"a group of usu[ally] three or more things or events standing or succeeding in order and having a like relationship to each other.\"   Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2073 (1986); accord Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 1074 (1989) (defining series to include \"a number of things or events of the same class coming one after another in spatial or temporal succession\");  The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1748 (2d ed. 1987) (defining series to include \"a group or a number of related or similar things, events, etc., arranged or occurring in temporal, spatial, or other order or succession\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Consistent with these definitions, all the benefit payments to Pentland form a single \"series\" as that word is used in section 105(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The like relationship of the payments is readily apparent.  The disbursements, both before and after the recalculation, form a continuing stream of monthly payments, made on account of the same disability, and determined at the time of inception under the same statutory scheme.  What is more, the ARB began to pay these serial benefits before the OWBPA's effective date, continued to pay them afterwards, and did so pursuant to an arrangement--the payment scheme established in the Massachusetts statute--that was in full flower when the OWBPA took effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the size of Pentland's monthly check diminished when she turned 65, but her argument that the reduced benefits comprise a new \"series\" because her payments were then recalculated on the basis of the superannuation tables is belied by the text of the Massachusetts statute.  It directs that an affected individual's benefits shall be adjusted \"to that to which [s]he would be entitled under the [statutory scheme] if [s]he were to be retired for superannuation.\"   Mass.Gen.L. ch. 32, Sec. 7(2)(b 1/2).  This language makes it transpicuously clear that Pentland has continuously received the same kind of benefits--accidental disability retirement benefits--both before and after the OWBPA's effective date.  Only the amount of the monthly stipend, not the nature of the payments, changed when she attained age 65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the expense of carting coals to Newcastle, we add that appellants' interpretation of a \"series\" as comprising, for all intents and purposes, a \"sequence of identical items,\" is profoundly flawed.  To read section 105(e) in this way would be totally at odds with ordinary usage and, moreover, would lead to absurd results.  Carried to its logical extreme, such a reading would gut the exemption by rendering it inapplicable to any stream of benefits that changed after the OWBPA's effective date by reference to an external source.  Thus, even the most commonplace adjustments (such as cost-of-living increases) would serve to defeat the exemption.  We cannot conceive of any reason why Congress--which patently believed that employers should have a substantial degree of protection against the application of a new rule to payment protocols already in use to sustain existing payment schemes--would have desired to take so quixotic a position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 105(e)'s reference to a preexisting \"arrangement\" is equally unhelpful to Pentland's quest.  Both section 7(2)(b 1/2) and the relevant superannuation guidelines were in existence at the time that the ARB started paying Pentland's retirement benefits, and the parties have not directed our attention to any subsequent changes in either provision which might support a finding that the Commonwealth put a fresh \"arrangement\" into effect.  In Pentland's case, therefore, the entire stream of benefit payments has been (and will be) made pursuant to a single arrangement that was crafted in whole prior to the OWBPA's effective date.  Consequently, section 105(e) applies unreservedly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the plain language of section 105(e) carries the day and obviates any need for a detailed examination of extrinsic sources, we note in passing that the legislative history of the OWBPA strongly suggests that Congress intended precisely the result that follows from a straightforward rendering of section 105(e)'s plain language.  The original draft of the bill, submitted to the Senate on September 17, 1990, contemplated that the OWBPA provisions on which Pentland relies would apply retrospectively.  See 136 Cong.Rec. S13, 237 (daily ed. Sept. 17, 1990).  This approach provoked stout opposition, and section 105(e) emerged as a compromise.  See 136 Cong.Rec. S13,603 (daily ed. Sept. 24, 1990).  In responding to a question about the truncated version of the nonretroactivity clause, Senator Pryor, chairman of the Special Committee on Aging and a prime sponsor of the legislation, indicated that the drafters intended, through the compromise, to ensure that the OWBPA would reach benefits that were discriminatorily structured after the applicable effective date, leaving other benefits unaffected.  See id. at S13,609.  Senator Metzenbaum, whose original bill, as we have said, featured broad retroactivity, concurred in this interpretation of the compromise language.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  So did another key supporter, Senator Hatch.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, it appears virtually certain that Congress did not intend the OWBPA to apply to benefit payments, like Pentland's, which were structured and commenced prior to the effective date of the neoteric legislation.  The comments relied on by the appellants in urging an opposite view--mainly statements by legislators who expressed their desire to avoid \"disruptions\" in ongoing benefits, such as the remarks of Senator Hatch, quoted supra note 6--are more plausibly read as wishing to avoid displacements that would be caused by wide-ranging retroactive application of the OWBPA rather than as guaranteeing level benefit rates, regardless of the circumstances, or as disfavoring changes in benefits compelled by the unamended operation of preexisting retirement schemes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have exhausted this issue.  To conclude, we hold that a stream of benefits does not become a new \"series\" in the contemplation of OWBPA Sec. 105(e) simply because the monthly benefit amount is adjusted by reference to an external source pursuant to a directive contained in a preexisting arrangement.  Riva and Pentland are, therefore, fishing in an empty pond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII.</p>\n    <p>The Ripeness Paradigm</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the more vexing of the two issues presented in this appeal.  Since section 7(2)(b 1/2) will not directly affect Keenan's stipend until the year 2002, the district court determined that his claim lacked the ripeness necessary to confer justiciability.  See Riva, 871 F.Supp. at 1517-18.   Before evaluating this determination, we scout the legal landscape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a litigant seeks relief that is primarily prospective in character, questions of ripeness are analyzed under a familiar framework that considers the fitness of the issue for immediate review and the hardship to the litigant should review be postponed.  See Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1515-16, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967);  Ernst &amp; Young, 45 F.3d at 535.   The fitness branch of the paradigm \"typically involves subsidiary queries concerning finality, definiteness, and the extent to which resolution of the challenge depends on facts that may not yet be sufficiently developed.\"  Ernst &amp; Young, 45 F.3d at 535.   One critical component is whether \"the claim involves uncertain and contingent events that may not occur as anticipated or may not occur at all.\"  Massachusetts Ass'n of Afro-Am.  Police, Inc. v. Boston Police Dep't, 973 F.2d 18, 20 (1st Cir.1992) (per curiam).  A second important factor in the fitness calculus is the extent to which the claim is bound up in the facts.  Courts are more likely to find a claim ripe if it is of an intrinsically legal nature, see, e.g., Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conserv. &amp; Dev.  Comm'n, 461 U.S. 190, 201, 103 S.Ct. 1713, 1720-21, 75 L.Ed.2d 752 (1983), and less likely to do so if the absence of a concrete factual situation seriously inhibits the weighing of competing interests, see, e.g., California Bankers Ass'n v. Shultz, 416 U.S. 21, 56, 94 S.Ct. 1494, 1515, 39 L.Ed.2d 812 (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A third salient factor that enters into the assessment of fitness involves the presence or absence of adverseness.  See State of R.I. v. Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d 685, 692-93 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 298, 130 L.Ed.2d 211 (1994).  In the context of prospective relief, this factor focuses on whether \"the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\"  Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct. 510, 512, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941).  Whether a particular case passes the test of adverseness may be influenced by a variety of considerations, such as whether all affected parties are before the court, see Ernst &amp; Young, 45 F.3d at 538-39, and whether the controversy as framed permits \"specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts,\" Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 241, 57 S.Ct. 461, 464, 81 L.Ed. 617 (1937).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hardship prong of the Abbott Labs. paradigm turns on whether \"the challenged action creates a 'direct and immediate' dilemma for the parties[.]\"  W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. U.S.E.P.A., 959 F.2d 360, 364 (1st Cir.1992) (citation omitted).  Utility is the flip side of the same coin, and an inquiring court, in assaying the hardship to the parties, may find it revealing to ask whether \"granting relief would serve a useful purpose, or, put another way, whether the sought-after declaration would be of practical assistance in setting the underlying controversy to rest.\"  Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d at 693.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it is a familiar bromide that courts should not labor to protect a party against harm that is merely remote or contingent, see, e.g., Ernst &amp; Young, 45 F.3d at 536;  Massachusetts Ass'n of Afro-Am.  Police, 973 F.2d at 20;  Lincoln House v. Dupre, 903 F.2d 845, 847 (1st Cir.1990), there is some play in the joints.  For example, even when the direct application of a statute is open to a charge of remoteness by reason of a lengthy, built-in time delay before the statute takes effect, ripeness may be found as long as the statute's operation is inevitable (or nearly so).  See, e.g., Regional Rail Reorg.  Act Cases, 419 U.S. 102, 142-43, 95 S.Ct. 335, 357-58, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974).  And, even when the direct application of such a statute is subject to some degree of contingency, the statute may impose sufficiently serious collateral injuries that an inquiring court will deem the hardship component satisfied.  See Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction Sec. 2.4.2, at 121-22 (2d ed. 1994).  In general, collateral effects can rise to this level when a statute indirectly permits private action that causes present harm, or when a party must decide currently whether to expend substantial resources that would be largely or entirely wasted if the issue were later resolved in an unfavorable way.  See, e.g., Pacific Gas, 461 U.S. at 201, 103 S.Ct. at 1720-21;  Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Envtl.  Study Group, Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 81-82, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 2634-35, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978).  We caution, however, that in such murky waters generalizations are dangerous, and the weighing of collateral effects is for the most part a judgment call, to be made case by case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VIII.</p>\n    <p>Applying the Paradigm</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed against this backdrop, we think that Keenan has made a satisfactory showing under both prongs of the Abbott Labs. paradigm.  Given the relative certainty of the statute's application, the purity of the legal issue presented, the presence of all necessary parties before the court, the dilemma that Keenan currently faces, and the hardship to him should immediate review be denied, we conclude that he has advanced a ripe claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The paramount harm to Keenan--the eventual reduction in his benefits pursuant to section 7(2)(b 1/2)--is distant in time, but its incidence seems highly probable.  The Commonwealth has pointed to three contingencies that might shield Keenan from ultimate harm of this kind:  (1) he might die before reaching age 65, (2) he might no longer be disabled when he reaches that age, or (3) the challenged statute might be amended prior thereto.  There is no evidence in the record to suggest that any of these three contingencies are likely to eventuate.  The life expectancy of a man in his mid-50s is roughly 20 years.  See, e.g., United States Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States:  1994 Table 116, at 88 (114th ed.);   Keenan's disability, according to state law, is permanent and total, see, e.g., Mass.Gen.L. ch. 32, Sec. 7(1) (1989) (providing for accidental disability retirement only when the affected employee is \"totally and permanently incapacitated for further duty\");  and, though the Commonwealth has drawn our attention to a bill pending in the Massachusetts legislature that would repeal section 7(2)(b 1/2), see 1995 Mass.H.B. 4007, 179th Gen.Court, 1st Sess., previous bills of a similar tenor have failed of enactment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, a litigant seeking shelter behind a ripeness defense must demonstrate more than a theoretical possibility that harm may be averted.  The demise of a party or the repeal of a statute will always be possible in any case of delayed enforcement, yet it is well settled that a time delay, without more, will not render a claim of statutory invalidity unripe if the application of the statute is otherwise sufficiently probable.  See Regional Rail Reorg.  Act Cases, 419 U.S. at 143, 95 S.Ct. at 358;  Lake Carriers' Ass'n v. MacMullan, 406 U.S. 498, 503-08, 92 S.Ct. 1749, 1753-56, 32 L.Ed.2d 257 (1972).  The degree of contingency is an important barometer of ripeness in this respect.  Compare, e.g., State of Ariz. v. Atchison, Topeka, and Sante Fe R.R. Co., 656 F.2d 398, 402-03 (9th Cir.1981) (finding challenge to statute ripe six months before its effective date due to the unlikelihood that the statutory scheme would change in the interim) with, e.g., Ernst &amp; Young, 45 F.3d at 538 (finding claim unripe due in part to the presence of a large number of contingencies, many of which were unlikely to materialize).  Here, the relative certainty of Keenan's asserted injury indicates that his claim is suitable for contemporaneous judicial review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three other circumstances buttress the conclusion that Keenan's claim is ready for adjudication.  In the first place, he mounts a facial challenge to the state law, and does so on a stipulated record.  Thus, his claim is unabashedly legal, and the district court is capable of resolving it with no further factual exposition.  Second, and relatedly, the controversy is narrowly defined and is susceptible to specific relief, adequate to conclude the matter, without speculation or reference to hypothetical facts, and without much risk that the court's opinion will prove superfluous.  Last but not least, the case is fully adverse;  all the proper parties are before the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are equally convinced that allowing the case to proceed, here and now, would serve a useful purpose, and would be of great practical assistance to all concerned.  See Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d at 693.   Not only is the utility of a decree obvious in this situation, but this utility also has special force in the context of a challenge to a discriminatory retirement system.  In Lorance v. AT &amp; T Technologies, Inc., 490 U.S. 900, 109 S.Ct. 2261, 104 L.Ed.2d 961 (1989), the Supreme Court considered the timeliness of a suit challenging a seniority system that allegedly discriminated against women.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The Court ruled that plaintiffs could sue at the time the seniority system was put in place, without awaiting the adverse effects of its operation.  See id. at 905-06, 109 S.Ct. at 2265-66.   In the bargain, the Justices recognized that the adoption of the plan imposed a \"concrete harm\" on the plaintiffs even though \"the benefits of a seniority system ... are by their nature speculative--if only because they depend upon the employee's continuing desire to work for the particular employer.\"  Id. at 907 n. 3, 109 S.Ct. at 2266 n. 3.   The Court then likened the harm imposed by adoption of an illegal seniority system to that imposed \"when an insurance company delivers an accident insurance policy with a face value of $10,000, when what has been paid for is a face value of $25,000.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though Lorance addressed a different issue--when a disparate impact violation of Title VII occurs for purposes of establishing the limitations period--we find guidance in the Court's recognition that the adoption of a discriminatory plan may itself impose an injury.  So it is here:  a ripeness analysis can take into account not only the harm that arises from the reduced value of Keenan's benefits, but also the harm from the state's possible endorsement of age discrimination and the prejudice that underlies it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the uncertainty about the validity of section 7(2)(b 1/2) is also imposing a present hardship on Keenan apart from the specter of reduced future benefits.  At age 58, people must nail down their plans for financial security in their golden years.  Thus, the most immediate harm to Keenan comes in the form of an inability prudently to arrange his fiscal affairs.  If Keenan anticipates that his benefits will not be reduced, and guesses wrong, he may find himself inadequately prepared to subsist on the unwanted birthday present--a drastically reduced pension--that will accompany his attainment of age 65.  Conversely, if he anticipates that the statute will be upheld, and guesses wrong, he may needlessly deprive himself in the intervening seven years, preparing for a rainy day that never dawns.  We believe that this uncertainty and the considerations of utility that we have mentioned coalesce to show that Keenan is suffering a sufficient present injury to satisfy the second prong of the Abbott Labs. paradigm.  See, e.g., Pacific Gas, 461 U.S. at 201, 103 S.Ct. at 1720-21;  Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 535-36, 45 S.Ct. 571, 573-74, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925) (allowing private schools to attack statute requiring public school attendance at a later date because of the statute's tendency to shift students immediately to public schools);  Crow Tribe of Indians v. Montana, 819 F.2d 895, 903 (9th Cir.1987) (finding justiciability in challenge to state tax on coal based in part on present difficulty in leasing mine), aff'd 484 U.S. 997, 108 S.Ct. 685, 98 L.Ed.2d 638 (1988);  Bob's Home Serv., Inc. v. Warren County, 755 F.2d 625, 627-29 (8th Cir.1985) (finding ripeness based in part on the reduced property value attributable to a land regulation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, although we recognize that courts have some discretion to grant or withhold declaratory relief, and that this discretion must be exercised cautiously when matters of either public import or constitutional dimension are implicated, see El Dia, Inc. v. Hernandez Colon, 963 F.2d 488, 494 (1st Cir.1992), the lower court did not squarely reject Keenan's claim in the exercise of its discretion, nor should it have done so.  Though the declaratory judgment context may serve to relax a federal court's storied obligation to exercise the jurisdiction given to it by Congress, see Fuller Co. v. Ramon I. Gil, Inc., 782 F.2d 306, 308 n. 3 (1st Cir.1986), the decision not to exercise jurisdiction must still be based on a careful balancing of efficiency, fairness, and the interests of both the public and the litigants.  See Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Liab.  Ins. Co. v. Kirkwood, 729 F.2d 61, 62 (1st Cir.1984).  In Keenan's case, this calculus strongly favors a contemporaneous adjudication.  In addition to the utility of a present determination, the challenged statute is free of ambiguity and straightforward in its operation.  There is no basis to suppose that any adjudication will be hampered by factual uncertainty.  There is no need to await clarification by a state court.  More importantly, Congress gave state and local governments two years between the passage of the OWBPA and its effective date to bring their retirement schemes into compliance.  The Commonwealth chose not to bestir itself during this period, and has still not taken legislative action though nearly five years have elapsed.  Any deference that might be owed under principles of comity has long since been repaid.  The retirement scheme must now face judicial scrutiny.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IX.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

Secs. 621-634 (1988), as amended by the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA), Pub.L. No. 101-433, 104 Stat. 978, presents two questions for review on appeal:  a question of first impression as to the operation of the OWBPA's nonretroactivity provision;  and a situation-specific question concerning justiciability.  The district court resolved both of these questions in the defendants' favor.  It entered summary judgment against a pair of plaintiffs, determining that the OWBPA did not apply to their claims, and simultaneously dismissed the third plaintiff's claim as unripe.  See Riva v.

Sec. 623(a).  The law originally contained an exclusion for employee benefit plans, providing that an employer could continue to \"observe the terms of ... any bona fide employee benefit plan such as a retirement, pension, or insurance plan, which is not a subterfuge to evade [ADEA's] purposes.\"   <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Sec. 623(f)(2). </span> The Department of Labor, and, later, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), interpreted this provision to require that age-based distinctions in benefit plans be cost-justified in order to qualify for the shelter of the exclusion.  See 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1625.10 (1988).  When confronted with the issue, the Supreme Court expanded the safe haven.  It held that, under the ADEA, an employee challenging a benefit plan must prove that \"the discriminatory plan provision actually was intended to serve the purpose of discriminating in some non-fringe-benefit aspect of the employment relation.\"  Public Employees Ret.

The amendments placed employee benefits squarely within the protective custody of the ADEA, overturned Betts, and reinstated the earlier view that age-based distinctions in employee benefits must be cost-justified.  Recognizing the potential implications of these changes for public employers, Congress stipulated that the OWBPA would not take effect as to states and their political subdivisions until two years after its passage.  See OWBPA Sec. 105(c).  Moreover, in grappling with the question of retroactivity, Congress decreed that the OWBPA would not apply at all to \"a series of benefit payments made to an individual or the individual's representative that began prior to the effective date and that continue after the effective date pursuant to an arrangement that was in effect on the effective date....\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112321\"><a href=\"/opinion/112321/public-employees-retirement-system-of-ohio-v-betts/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Sec. 105(e).</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>The Commonwealth's Disability Retirement Scheme</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Massachusetts, public employees who are injured on the job and cannot continue working may retire and receive accidental disability benefits.

Under section 7(2)(b 1/2), an employee who fits this description receives her regular disability retirement benefits until she turns 65, but her benefits are then refigured to equal the amount she would have received if she retired on superannuation, i.e., if she retired based on age and years of service.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>The Plaintiffs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Albert Riva commenced his employment with the City of Boston in August of 1982.  He retired in April of 1992 after experiencing a permanently disabling injury.  At the time of his retirement, Riva had not yet accrued ten years of creditable service.  On August 19, 1992, the Boston Retirement Board (BRB) transmitted a letter advising him that his benefits were subject to reduction under section 7(2)(b 1/2).  Approximately one year later, after Riva had celebrated his sixty-fifth birthday, the Board implemented the law and reduced Riva's benefits from approximately $2,130 per month to approximately $775 per month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nancy Pentland was employed by the Town of Andover from February of 1981 until she retired due to a job-related disability on November 30, 1988.  At the time of her retirement, she was 61 years old but had not yet accrued ten years of creditable service.  As of October 31, 1992, the Andover Retirement Board (ARB) recalculated her benefits according to the superannuation guidelines, resulting in a substantial downsizing of her monthly stipend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robert Keenan toiled as a Boston school custodian from December of 1989 until March of 1991.  At the age of 56, having less than ten years of creditable service, he retired on accidental disability and began receiving a monthly allowance effective February 20, 1993.  On June 22, 1994, the BRB notified him of the prospective applicability of section 7(2)(b 1/2) to his case.  Keenan was born on August 10, 1937, so his monthly benefit is not scheduled to be recalculated until the year 2002.  Nonetheless, subscribing to the adage that an ounce of prevention is sometimes worth a pound of cure, he (like Riva and Pentland before him) filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is significant that, when the OWBPA took effect, both Riva and Pentland were already receiving disability retirement benefits, but Keenan--whose retirement postdated the statute's effective date--was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>The Litigation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riva and Pentland commenced the instant action against, inter alia, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Public Employee Retirement Administration, the BRB, and the ARB (collectively, \"the Commonwealth\").  Their complaint sought declaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief, alleging that the Massachusetts accidental disability retirement scheme violated the OWBPA because it arbitrarily reduced retirement benefits based on the recipient's age.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Keenan subsequently joined the suit as an additional plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties cross-moved for summary judgment on stipulated facts.  The district court granted brevis disposition in the Commonwealth's favor vis-a-vis Riva and Pentland, and dismissed Keenan's claim as unripe.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Riva,</span> <span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">1517-20</span></span>.   The court ruled that even though Riva's and Pentland's benefits were recalculated after the effective date of the OWBPA (when they reached age 65), the smaller payments were of the same class as the original payments, were part of a single series of benefit payments that straddled the effective date, and were paid pursuant to a preexisting arrangement.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1519. </span>  Hence, section 105(e) applied, and the Massachusetts disability retirement scheme, as it affected those plaintiffs, eluded the OWBPA's grasp.

Unlike Riva and Pentland, he began receiving benefit payments only after the OWBPA had become fully effective.  Thus, his claim does not fit within the confines of section 105(e).  In the trial court's view, however, a different obstacle loomed.  Because Keenan's benefits were not scheduled to be pared for several years, Keenan's alleged injury was both remote and contingent, and, accordingly, his claim was unripe.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span> </a></span>(1991).  Applying these tenets, we find that section 105(e) unambiguously excludes Pentland's benefits from the application of the OWBPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously noted, Congress exempted from the OWBPA's grasp any \"series of benefit payments ... that began prior to [OWBPA's] effective date and that continue after the effective date pursuant to an arrangement that was in effect on the effective date....\"  OWBPA Sec. 105(e).  A \"series\" is routinely defined as \"a group of usu[ally] three or more things or events standing or succeeding in order and having a like relationship to each other.\"   Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2073 (1986); accord Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 1074 (1989) (defining series to include \"a number of things or events of the same class coming one after another in spatial or temporal succession\");  The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1748 (2d ed. 1987) (defining series to include \"a group or a number of related or similar things, events, etc., arranged or occurring in temporal, spatial, or other order or succession\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Consistent with these definitions, all the benefit payments to Pentland form a single \"series\" as that word is used in section 105(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The like relationship of the payments is readily apparent.  The disbursements, both before and after the recalculation, form a continuing stream of monthly payments, made on account of the same disability, and determined at the time of inception under the same statutory scheme.  What is more, the ARB began to pay these serial benefits before the OWBPA's effective date, continued to pay them afterwards, and did so pursuant to an arrangement--the payment scheme established in the Massachusetts statute--that was in full flower when the OWBPA took effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the size of Pentland's monthly check diminished when she turned 65, but her argument that the reduced benefits comprise a new \"series\" because her payments were then recalculated on the basis of the superannuation tables is belied by the text of the Massachusetts statute.  It directs that an affected individual's benefits shall be adjusted \"to that to which [s]he would be entitled under the [statutory scheme] if [s]he were to be retired for superannuation.\"   Mass.Gen.L. ch. 32, Sec. 7(2)(b 1/2).  This language makes it transpicuously clear that Pentland has continuously received the same kind of benefits--accidental disability retirement benefits--both before and after the OWBPA's effective date.  Only the amount of the monthly stipend, not the nature of the payments, changed when she attained age 65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the expense of carting coals to Newcastle, we add that appellants' interpretation of a \"series\" as comprising, for all intents and purposes, a \"sequence of identical items,\" is profoundly flawed.  To read section 105(e) in this way would be totally at odds with ordinary usage and, moreover, would lead to absurd results.  Carried to its logical extreme, such a reading would gut the exemption by rendering it inapplicable to any stream of benefits that changed after the OWBPA's effective date by reference to an external source.  Thus, even the most commonplace adjustments (such as cost-of-living increases) would serve to defeat the exemption.  We cannot conceive of any reason why Congress--which patently believed that employers should have a substantial degree of protection against the application of a new rule to payment protocols already in use to sustain existing payment schemes--would have desired to take so quixotic a position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 105(e)'s reference to a preexisting \"arrangement\" is equally unhelpful to Pentland's quest.  Both section 7(2)(b 1/2) and the relevant superannuation guidelines were in existence at the time that the ARB started paying Pentland's retirement benefits, and the parties have not directed our attention to any subsequent changes in either provision which might support a finding that the Commonwealth put a fresh \"arrangement\" into effect.  In Pentland's case, therefore, the entire stream of benefit payments has been (and will be) made pursuant to a single arrangement that was crafted in whole prior to the OWBPA's effective date.  Consequently, section 105(e) applies unreservedly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the plain language of section 105(e) carries the day and obviates any need for a detailed examination of extrinsic sources, we note in passing that the legislative history of the OWBPA strongly suggests that Congress intended precisely the result that follows from a straightforward rendering of section 105(e)'s plain language.  The original draft of the bill, submitted to the Senate on September 17, 1990, contemplated that the OWBPA provisions on which Pentland relies would apply retrospectively.  See 136 Cong.Rec. S13, 237 (daily ed. Sept. 17, 1990).  This approach provoked stout opposition, and section 105(e) emerged as a compromise.  See 136 Cong.Rec. S13,603 (daily ed. Sept. 24, 1990).  In responding to a question about the truncated version of the nonretroactivity clause, Senator Pryor, chairman of the Special Committee on Aging and a prime sponsor of the legislation, indicated that the drafters intended, through the compromise, to ensure that the OWBPA would reach benefits that were discriminatorily structured after the applicable effective date, leaving other benefits unaffected.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112670\"><a href=\"/opinion/112670/king-v-st-vincents-hospital/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at S13,609. </a></span> Senator Metzenbaum, whose original bill, as we have said, featured broad retroactivity, concurred in this interpretation of the compromise language.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  So did another key supporter, Senator Hatch.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, it appears virtually certain that Congress did not intend the OWBPA to apply to benefit payments, like Pentland's, which were structured and commenced prior to the effective date of the neoteric legislation.  The comments relied on by the appellants in urging an opposite view--mainly statements by legislators who expressed their desire to avoid \"disruptions\" in ongoing benefits, such as the remarks of Senator Hatch, quoted supra note 6--are more plausibly read as wishing to avoid displacements that would be caused by wide-ranging retroactive application of the OWBPA rather than as guaranteeing level benefit rates, regardless of the circumstances, or as disfavoring changes in benefits compelled by the unamended operation of preexisting retirement schemes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have exhausted this issue.  To conclude, we hold that a stream of benefits does not become a new \"series\" in the contemplation of OWBPA Sec. 105(e) simply because the monthly benefit amount is adjusted by reference to an external source pursuant to a directive contained in a preexisting arrangement.  Riva and Pentland are, therefore, fishing in an empty pond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII.</p>\n    <p>The Ripeness Paradigm</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the more vexing of the two issues presented in this appeal.  Since section 7(2)(b 1/2) will not directly affect Keenan's stipend until the year 2002, the district court determined that his claim lacked the ripeness necessary to confer justiciability.

For example, even when the direct application of a statute is open to a charge of remoteness by reason of a lengthy, built-in time delay before the statute takes effect, ripeness may be found as long as the statute's operation is inevitable (or nearly so).  See, e.g., Regional Rail Reorg.  Act Cases, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109117\"><a href=\"/opinion/109117/regional-rail-reorganization-act-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span>, 142-43, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109117\"><a href=\"/opinion/109117/regional-rail-reorganization-act-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And, even when the direct application of such a statute is subject to some degree of contingency, the statute may impose sufficiently serious collateral injuries that an inquiring court will deem the hardship component satisfied.  See Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction Sec. 2.4.2, at 121-22 (2d ed. 1994).  In general, collateral effects can rise to this level when a statute indirectly permits private action that causes present harm, or when a party must decide currently whether to expend substantial resources that would be largely or entirely wasted if the issue were later resolved in an unfavorable way.

Given the relative certainty of the statute's application, the purity of the legal issue presented, the presence of all necessary parties before the court, the dilemma that Keenan currently faces, and the hardship to him should immediate review be denied, we conclude that he has advanced a ripe claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The paramount harm to Keenan--the eventual reduction in his benefits pursuant to section 7(2)(b 1/2)--is distant in time, but its incidence seems highly probable.  The Commonwealth has pointed to three contingencies that might shield Keenan from ultimate harm of this kind:  (1) he might die before reaching age 65, (2) he might no longer be disabled when he reaches that age, or (3) the challenged statute might be amended prior thereto.  There is no evidence in the record to suggest that any of these three contingencies are likely to eventuate.  The life expectancy of a man in his mid-50s is roughly 20 years.  See, e.g., United States Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States:  1994 Table 116, at 88 (114th ed.);   Keenan's disability, according to state law, is permanent and total, see, e.g., Mass.Gen.L. ch. 32, Sec. 7(1) (1989) (providing for accidental disability retirement only when the affected employee is \"totally and permanently incapacitated for further duty\");  and, though the Commonwealth has drawn our attention to a bill pending in the Massachusetts legislature that would repeal section 7(2)(b 1/2), see 1995 Mass.H.B. 4007, 179th Gen.Court, 1st Sess., previous bills of a similar tenor have failed of enactment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, a litigant seeking shelter behind a ripeness defense must demonstrate more than a theoretical possibility that harm may be averted.  The demise of a party or the repeal of a statute will always be possible in any case of delayed enforcement, yet it is well settled that a time delay, without more, will not render a claim of statutory invalidity unripe if the application of the statute is otherwise sufficiently probable.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span> </a></span>(1972).  The degree of contingency is an important barometer of ripeness in this respect.  Compare, e.g., State of Ariz. v. Atchison, Topeka, and Sante Fe R.R. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"393045\"><a href=\"/opinion/393045/state-of-arizona-and-arizona-department-of-revenue-v-atchison-topeka-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">656</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span>, 402-03 (9th Cir.1981) (finding challenge to statute ripe six months before its effective date due to the unlikelihood that the statutory scheme would change in the interim) with, e.g., Ernst &amp; <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195859\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Young,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195859/ernst-young-v-depositors-economic/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">538</span> </a></span>(finding claim unripe due in part to the presence of a large number of contingencies, many of which were unlikely to materialize).

In the first place, he mounts a facial challenge to the state law, and does so on a stipulated record.  Thus, his claim is unabashedly legal, and the district court is capable of resolving it with no further factual exposition.  Second, and relatedly, the controversy is narrowly defined and is susceptible to specific relief, adequate to conclude the matter, without speculation or reference to hypothetical facts, and without much risk that the court's opinion will prove superfluous.  Last but not least, the case is fully adverse;  all the proper parties are before the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are equally convinced that allowing the case to proceed, here and now, would serve a useful purpose, and would be of great practical assistance to all concerned.

In the bargain, the Justices recognized that the adoption of the plan imposed a \"concrete harm\" on the plaintiffs even though \"the benefits of a seniority system ... are by their nature speculative--if only because they depend upon the employee's continuing desire to work for the particular employer.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 907 </span>n. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">3,</span> <span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court then likened the harm imposed by adoption of an illegal seniority system to that imposed \"when an insurance company delivers an accident insurance policy with a face value of $10,000, when what has been paid for is a face value of $25,000.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though Lorance addressed a different issue--when a disparate impact violation of Title VII occurs for purposes of establishing the limitations period--we find guidance in the Court's recognition that the adoption of a discriminatory plan may itself impose an injury.  So it is here:  a ripeness analysis can take into account not only the harm that arises from the reduced value of Keenan's benefits, but also the harm from the state's possible endorsement of age discrimination and the prejudice that underlies it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the uncertainty about the validity of section 7(2)(b 1/2) is also imposing a present hardship on Keenan apart from the specter of reduced future benefits.  At age 58, people must nail down their plans for financial security in their golden years.  Thus, the most immediate harm to Keenan comes in the form of an inability prudently to arrange his fiscal affairs.  If Keenan anticipates that his benefits will not be reduced, and guesses wrong, he may find himself inadequately prepared to subsist on the unwanted birthday present--a drastically reduced pension--that will accompany his attainment of age 65.  Conversely, if he anticipates that the statute will be upheld, and guesses wrong, he may needlessly deprive himself in the intervening seven years, preparing for a rainy day that never dawns.  We believe that this uncertainty and the considerations of utility that we have mentioned coalesce to show that Keenan is suffering a sufficient present injury to satisfy the second prong of the Abbott Labs. paradigm.

Warren County, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"448208\"><a href=\"/opinion/448208/bobs-home-service-inc-and-laverne-a-zykan-v-warren-county-leonard-h/\"><span class=\"volume\">755</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span>, 627-29 (8th Cir.1985) (finding ripeness based in part on the reduced property value attributable to a land regulation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, although we recognize that courts have some discretion to grant or withhold declaratory relief, and that this discretion must be exercised cautiously when matters of either public import or constitutional dimension are implicated, see El Dia, Inc. v. Hernandez Colon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583336\"><a href=\"/opinion/583336/el-dia-inc-v-rafael-hernandez-colon/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span>, 494 (1st Cir.1992), the lower court did not squarely reject Keenan's claim in the exercise of its discretion, nor should it have done so.  Though the declaratory judgment context may serve to relax a federal court's storied obligation to exercise the jurisdiction given to it by Congress, see Fuller Co. v. Ramon I. Gil, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"463727\"><a href=\"/opinion/463727/fuller-company-v-ramon-i-gil-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">782</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span>, 308 n. 3 (1st Cir.1986), the decision not to exercise jurisdiction must still be based on a careful balancing of efficiency, fairness, and the interests of both the public and the litigants.  See Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Liab.  Ins. Co. v. Kirkwood, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"432002\"><a href=\"/opinion/432002/metropolitan-property-and-liability-insurance-co-v-bonnie-mccosker/\"><span class=\"volume\">729</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir.1984).  In Keenan's case, this calculus strongly favors a contemporaneous adjudication.  In addition to the utility of a present determination, the challenged statute is free of ambiguity and straightforward in its operation.  There is no basis to suppose that any adjudication will be hampered by factual uncertainty.  There is no need to await clarification by a state court.  More importantly, Congress gave state and local governments two years between the passage of the OWBPA and its effective date to bring their retirement schemes into compliance.  The Commonwealth chose not to bestir itself during this period, and has still not taken legislative action though nearly five years have elapsed.  Any deference that might be owed under principles of comity has long since been repaid.  The retirement scheme must now face judicial scrutiny.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IX.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.
