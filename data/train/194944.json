Christopher Amann  is a learning-disabled\n               \n\nchild who for  several years attended public school  in Stow,\n\nMassachusetts.   In 1987, Christopher's  parents withdrew him\n\nfrom  the  public school  system and  sent  him to  a private\n\nschool that  specializes in  teaching children with  learning\n\ndisabilities.    In  1989,  the Amanns  attempted  to  obtain\n\nreimbursement for  the cost of the  private school placement.\n\nStow responded by framing an  \"individualized education plan\"\n\n[IEP] that envisioned Christopher's return to  public school.\n\nThe Amanns  rejected this plan  and initiated  administrative\n\nproceedings pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Act\n\n[IDEA],  20  U.S.C.     1415,   claiming  that  the  IEP  was\n\ninadequate for Christopher's needs.  To this the Amanns later\n\nadded a claim that, regardless of the educational adequacy of\n\nthe  IEP,  the   Stow  schools  themselves  were   physically\n\ninadequate because their drinking water was contaminated with\n\nunsafe levels  of  lead.   When the  Massachusetts Bureau  of\n\nSpecial  Education [BSEA]  declined to  give them  the relief\n\nthey  sought, the Amanns filed  suit under both  the IDEA and\n\nthe Safe Drinking Water Act [SDWA], 42 U.S.C.    300f et seq.\n                                                            \n\nIt  may be convenient to  refer to this  lawsuit, which named\n\nboth the Town of Stow and the Commonwealth of  Massachusetts,\n\nas Amann I.\n          \n\n     The district  court dismissed the complaint  in Amann I,\n                                                            \n\nruling (1)  that Stow's  proposed IEP  was adequate, and  (2)\n\nthat  the Amanns  had  failed to  give the  notice that  is a\n\nprerequisite to any suit under the SDWA.  We affirmed.  Amann\n                                                             \n\nv. Stow School System, 982 F.2d 644 (1st Cir. 1992).\n                     \n\n     The Amanns returned to the BSEA in 1991, challenging the\n\nadequacy  of the IEP that Stow had proposed for the 1991-1992\n\nschool year, and again complaining about the presence of lead\n\nin  the  public school's  water  supply.    Again,  the  BSEA\n\ndetermined  that the IEP  was adequate;  it also  ruled that,\n\nalthough the piped water  in the school contained lead,  Stow\n\nadequately  had  ensured  the   safety  of  its  students  by\n\nproviding bottled water for drinking and cooking.  Again, the\n\nAmanns sought review  of the BSEA decision  in federal court.\n\nThe  district court  dismissed  this lawsuit  (which we  will\n\nrefer to  as Amann II)  on the  ground that it  had not  been\n                     \n\nfiled within  the 30-day limit  applicable to  IDEA suits  in\n\nMassachusetts.  Amann v. Stow, 991 F.2d 929 (1st Cir. 1993).\n                             \n\n     On the same day that they filed Amann II, the appellants\n                                             \n\nalso commenced  this lawsuit under the SDWA.  Their complaint\n\nnamed  the  Town  of  Stow,  the   Stow  School  System,  the\n\nCommonwealth  of Massachusetts  and  the  United States,  and\n\nsought both  compensation and injunctive relief.   At length,\n\nthe  district   court  granted   judgment  to  each   of  the\n\ndefendants, and this appeal followed.\n\n                             -3-\n\n                              I\n                               \n\n     The Amanns'  claim against  the United States  sought an\n\norder directing the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]  to\n\nrevoke  Massachusetts'   primary  enforcement  responsibility\n\nunder  the SDWA.    See 42  U.S.C.    300g-2  (giving  states\n                       \n\nprimary  enforcement  responsibility  as long  as  they  meet\n\ncertain criteria).   However, Congress anticipated  \"that the\n\nEPA  would  enjoy the  broadest  discretion  in reaching  the\n\ndetermination that  the primary criteria are  no longer met,\"\n\nNational Wildlife Fed'n v.  United States EPA, 980  F.2d 765,\n                                             \n\n770  (D.C.Cir. 1992), and the SDWA authorizes citizens to sue\n\nthe EPA only where the agency has failed to perform an act or\n\nduty which  is not  discretionary, 42 U.S.C.    300j-8(a)(2).\n                  \n\nThe Amanns  therefore had no  statutory authority to  sue the\n\nEPA and  the district  court correctly dismissed  their claim\n\nagainst the United States.\n\n                              II\n                                \n\n     The  district court  also correctly dismissed  the claim\n\nagainst  the Commonwealth  of Massachusetts.    The complaint\n\nnamed  the  Commonwealth, not  one  of  its  officials, as  a\n\ndefendant, and \"[i]t is clear, of course, that in the absence\n\nof  consent a suit in which  the State . . .  is named as the\n\ndefendant  is   proscribed   by  the   Eleventh   Amendment.\"\n\nPennhurst State School &amp; Hospital v. Halderman, 465  U.S. 89,\n                                              \n\n100  (1984).  See also  42 U.S.C.   300j-8(a)(1) (authorizing\n                      \n\n                             -4-\n\ncitizen  suits against  a  \"governmental  instrumentality  or\n\nagency\"  only  \" to  the  extent  permitted  by the  eleventh\n\namendment\").    We  see  no evidence  that  the  Commonwealth\n\nconsented to suit in this case. \n\n                             III\n                                \n\n     The Amanns assert  that the  Town of Stow  and the  Stow\n\nSchool  System [collectively  Stow] are  in violation  of the\n\nSDWA due to the presence of lead in the water supplied to the\n\nschool.   They  also  allege that  Stow  violated the  public\n\nnotice  provision of the SDWA.   40 C.F.R.    141.34(a).  The\n\ndistrict court granted Stow's motion for summary judgment.\n\n     According to  EPA regulations,  the school water  supply\n\nsystem  is  not  a  \"community  water  system\"  but  a  \"non-\n\ntransient,  non-community water  system.\"   See  40 C.F.R.   \n                                               \n\n141.2 (defining both terms).   Maximum contaminant levels for\n\nlead applied  only to community water  systems until December\n\n7, 1992.   40 C.F.R.    141.11(a).  Since that  date, the EPA\n\nhas been phasing  in a new \"lead and  copper rule\" which sets\n\nmaximum  levels for  both community  and  non-community water\n\nsystems.   The  rules are  phased in  at different  times for\n\ndifferent size  systems and  began to apply  to non-community\n\nwater  systems the  size of Stow  only on  July 1,  1993.  40\n\nC.F.R.    141.86(d).  As  of that date,  Stow is  required to\n\nmonitor its water system for  a six month period in  order to\n\ndetermine  whether \"the  system  exceeds the  lead or  copper\n\n                             -5-\n\naction  level  and is  therefore  required  to implement  the\n\ncorrosion  control treatment  requirements under  [40 C.F.R.]\n\n141.81.\"   40 C.F.R.   141.86(d)(ii).  \"The lead action level\n\nis  exceeded if  the concentration  of lead  in more  than 10\n\npercent of tap water  samples collected during any monitoring\n\nperiod conducted in accordance with   141.86 is  greater than\n\n0.015  mg/L.\"   40  C.F.R.    141.80(c)(1).   A  system which\n\nexceeds  the lead action level is required to follow a system\n\nof treatment  steps which must begin \"within six months after\n\nit   exceeds  one  of  the  action  levels.\"    40  C.F.R.   \n\n141.81(e)(1).  See  also 40 C.F.R.   141.83(a)(1)  (\"A system\n                        \n\nexceeding the lead or copper action level shall complete lead\n\nand copper  source water monitoring (  141.88(b))  and make a\n\ntreatment  recommendation  to  the State  (   141.83  (b)(1))\n\nwithin 6  months after exceeding  the lead  or copper  action\n\nlevel.\").  In  other words, as we understand the regulations,\n\nthe  only obligation  imposed now  upon Stow  as far  as lead\n\ncontamination is  concerned is to monitor its system for lead\n\npresence.  No treatment  steps are required until  six months\n\nafter the  completion of  the first monitoring  period (which\n\nends on January 1, 1994).\n\n     The  Amanns, however,  have  not alleged  that Stow  has\n\nfailed to monitor the  presence of lead in its  water system.\n\nRather,  they  allege  that  the  system  contains  excessive\n\namounts of lead.  Since we understand the school water system\n\n                             -6-\n\nto be  not yet subject  to the maximum lead  level imposed by\n\nthe EPA,  we find  that Stow  was entitled to  judgment as  a\n\nmatter of law  on this  issue and that  summary judgment  was\n\nappropriate.  See Mattoon  v. Pittsfield, 980 F.2d 1,  7 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir.  1992)  (SDWA allows  citizens  suits  only for  ongoing\n\nviolations).\n\n     The  Amanns also  allege that  Stow violated  the public\n\nnotification requirement contained in 40  C.F.R.   141.34(a).\n\nThis  section requires  that the  owner of any  \"water system\n\nshall issue notice to  persons served by the system  that may\n\nbe affected  by lead contamination of  their drinking water.\"\n\nSubsections (b), (c)  and (d) of the  same regulation outline\n\nthe required manner and content of the notice.  \n\n     Appellants concede  that permanent  signs are  posted in\n\nthe school showing the drinking water supply to be hazardous.\n\nSee 40 C.F.R.   141.34(b) (\"For  non-transient, non-community\n   \n\nwater systems, notice may  be given by continuous posting.\").\n\nMoreover,  they  have   provided  no  elaboration   in  their\n\ncomplaint,  in their  opposition  to summary  judgment or  in\n\ntheir brief as to how this notice is inadequate.  Even pro se\n\nplaintiffs  cannot  survive  a motion  for  summary  judgment\n\nunless  they refer  to some material  facts to  support their\n\nbare allegations.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n                      \n\n     The district court's judgment is affirmed.\n                                              \n\n                             -7-\n",

In 1987, Christopher's parents withdrew him from the public school system and sent him to a private school that specializes in teaching children with learning disabilities.  In 1989, the Amanns attempted to obtain reimbursement for the cost of the private school placement.  Stow responded by framing an \"individualized education plan\" [IEP] that envisioned Christopher's return to public school.  The Amanns rejected this plan and initiated administrative proceedings pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Act [IDEA], 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415, claiming that the IEP was inadequate for Christopher's needs.  To this the Amanns later added a claim that, regardless of the educational adequacy of the IEP, the Stow schools themselves were physically inadequate because their drinking water was contaminated with unsafe levels of lead.  When the Massachusetts Bureau of Special Education [BSEA] declined to give them the relief they sought, the Amanns filed suit under both the IDEA and the Safe Drinking Water Act [SDWA], 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300f et seq.

Maximum contaminant levels for lead applied only to community water systems until December 7, 1992.  40 C.F.R.  &#167;  141.11(a).  Since that date, the EPA has been phasing in a new \"lead and copper rule\" which sets maximum levels for both community and non-community water systems.  The rules are phased in at different times for different size systems and began to apply to non-community water systems the size of Stow only on July 1, 1993.  40 C.F.R. &#167; 141.86(d).  As of that date, Stow is required to monitor its water system for a six month period in order to determine whether \"the system exceeds the lead or copper action level and is therefore required to implement the corrosion control treatment requirements under [40 C.F.R.] 141.81.\"  40 C.F.R. &#167; 141.86(d)(ii).  \"The lead action level is exceeded if the concentration of lead in more than 10 percent of tap water samples collected during any monitoring period conducted in accordance with &#167; 141.86 is greater than 0.015 mg/L.\"  40 C.F.R. &#167; 141.80(c)(1).  A system which exceeds the lead action level is required to follow a system of treatment steps which must begin \"within six months after it exceeds one of the action levels.\"  40 C.F.R. &#167; 141.81(e)(1).  See also 40 C.F.R.  &#167;  141.83(a)(1) (\"A system exceeding the lead or copper action level shall complete lead and copper source water monitoring (&#167; 141.88(b)) and make a treatment recommendation to the State (&#167; 141.83(b)(1)) within 6 months after exceeding the lead or copper action level.\").  In other words, as we understand the regulations, the only obligation imposed now upon Stow as far as lead contamination is concerned is to monitor its system for lead presence.  No treatment steps are required until six months after the completion of the first monitoring period (which ends on January 1, 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Amanns, however, have not alleged that Stow has failed to monitor the presence of lead in its water system.  Rather, they allege that the system contains excessive amounts of lead.  Since we understand the school water system to be not yet subject to the maximum lead level imposed by the EPA, we find that Stow was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this issue and that summary judgment was appropriate.   See Mattoon v.

In 1987, Christopher's parents withdrew him from the public school system and sent him to a private school that specializes in teaching children with learning disabilities.  In 1989, the Amanns attempted to obtain reimbursement for the cost of the private school placement.  Stow responded by framing an \"individualized education plan\" [IEP] that envisioned Christopher's return to public school.  The Amanns rejected this plan and initiated administrative proceedings pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Act [IDEA], 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415, claiming that the IEP was inadequate for Christopher's needs.  To this the Amanns later added a claim that, regardless of the educational adequacy of the IEP, the Stow schools themselves were physically inadequate because their drinking water was contaminated with unsafe levels of lead.  When the Massachusetts Bureau of Special Education [BSEA] declined to give them the relief they sought, the Amanns filed suit under both the IDEA and the Safe Drinking Water Act [SDWA], 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300f et seq.  It may be convenient to refer to this lawsuit, which named both the Town of Stow and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as Amann I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the complaint in Amann I, ruling (1) that Stow's proposed IEP was adequate, and (2) that the Amanns had failed to give the notice that is a prerequisite to any suit under the SDWA.  We affirmed.   Amann v. Stow School System, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597411\"><a href=\"/opinion/597411/christopher-amann-v-stow-school-system/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Amanns returned to the BSEA in 1991, challenging the adequacy of the IEP that Stow had proposed for the 1991-1992 school year, and again complaining about the presence of lead in the public school's water supply.  Again, the BSEA determined that the IEP was adequate;  it also ruled that, although the piped water in the school contained lead, Stow adequately had ensured the safety of its students by providing bottled water for drinking and cooking.  Again, the Amanns sought review of the BSEA decision in federal court.  The district court dismissed this lawsuit (which we will refer to as Amann II ) on the ground that it had not been filed within the 30-day limit applicable to IDEA suits in Massachusetts.   Amann v. Stow, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605528\"><a href=\"/opinion/605528/richard-amann-v-town-of-stow/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day that they filed Amann II, the appellants also commenced this lawsuit under the SDWA.  Their complaint named the Town of Stow, the Stow School System, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the United States, and sought both compensation and injunctive relief.  At length, the district court granted judgment to each of the defendants, and this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The Amanns' claim against the United States sought an order directing the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] to revoke Massachusetts' primary enforcement responsibility under the SDWA.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300g-2 (giving states primary enforcement responsibility as long as they meet certain criteria).  However, Congress anticipated \"that the EPA would enjoy the broadest discretion in reaching the determination that the primary criteria are no longer met,\"  National Wildlife Fed'n v. United States EPA, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596098\"><a href=\"/opinion/596098/national-wildlife-federation-v-united-states-environmental-protection/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 770 (D.C.Cir. 1992), and the SDWA authorizes citizens to sue the EPA only where the agency has failed to perform an act or duty which is not discretionary, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300j-8(a)(2).  The Amanns therefore had no statutory authority to sue the EPA and the district court correctly dismissed their claim against the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also correctly dismissed the claim against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  The complaint named the Commonwealth, not one of its officials, as a defendant, and \"[i]t is clear, of course, that in the absence of consent a suit in which the State ... is named as the defendant is proscribed by the Eleventh Amendment.\"   Pennhurst State School &amp; Hospital v. Halderman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111094\"><a href=\"/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 100 (1984).  See also 42 U.S.C. &#167;  300j-8(a)(1) (authorizing citizen suits against a \"governmental instrumentality or agency\" only \" to the extent permitted by the eleventh amendment\").  We see no evidence that the Commonwealth consented to suit in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Amanns assert that the Town of Stow and the Stow School System [collectively Stow] are in violation of the SDWA due to the presence of lead in the water supplied to the school.  They also allege that Stow violated the public notice provision of the SDWA. 40 C.F.R. &#167; 141.34(a).
