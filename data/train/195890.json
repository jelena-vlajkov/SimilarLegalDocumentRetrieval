Petitioner  Gregorio Rosario  appeals the\r                            \n\ndenial by the  United States District Court for  the District\n\nof  Massachusetts of  his  motion to  vacate,  set aside,  or\n\ncorrect his sentence pursuant  to 28 U.S.C.   2255.   Rosario\n\nalleges that the district  court erred both in the  manner in\n\nwhich it  conducted the section  2255 proceedings and  in its\n\ndismissal of his petition.  We affirm.\n\n     We  find no error in the district court's conduct of the\n\nsection 2255  proceedings.   First, even though  the district\n\ncourt required that Rosario have standby counsel, Rosario has\n\nnot  produced any evidence that  he lacked \"a  fair chance to\n\npresent  his case in his own  way.\"  McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465\r                                                                    \n\nU.S. 168,  177 (1984).    Thus, he  has  failed to  show  any\n\nabridgment  of  his  right  to  self  representation.1    Id.\r                                                                        \n\nSecond,  we have reviewed the record  in this case, including\n\nthe transcript of the surveillance tape, and find no abuse of\n\ndiscretion  in the  district  court's refusal  to compel  the\n\ngovernment's chief  witness  to  testify  during  the  habeas\n\nproceedings.     See  Rule   6(a)  of  the   Rules  Governing\r                                \n\nProceedings in the United States District Court Under Section\n\n2255.  We likewise find absolutely no evidence of bias on the\n\npart  of the  district  court  in  any  of  its  rulings  and\n\ntherefore  find no  error in  the court's  refusal to  recuse\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  The legal right to self  representation in civil cases is\nguaranteed by 28 U.S.C.   1654.\r\r\n\nitself  from this  case.   See Liteky  v.

We find\n\nthat the  district court adequately addressed  all the claims\n\nraised by Rosario in his petition.  We also find, essentially\n\nfor  the reasons given by the district court in its memoranda\n\nand orders dated September 14, 1993, and March 21, 1994, that\n\nRosario  has failed  to show  that he  is entitled  to relief\n\nunder section 2255.\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
