Unlike the Fee Appeals, which are concerned primarily\n\n(albeit  not exclusively) with  a global, end-of-litigation award\n\nof  attorneys' fees, these two  appeals involve only  an order in\n\nrespect to  costs.1  Moreover,  the order appealed  from resolves\n\nonly one isolated  component of  the dispute over  costs in  this\n\nmassive litigation.  In other orders anent costs, e.g., Order No.\r                                                                \n\n478; Order No. 510-A, the district court has limned its preferred\n\napproach  for  resolving certain  other  aspects  of the  overall\n\ninquiry  into costs.   However,  most of  the issues  relating to\n\ncosts remain pending, unresolved, in the court below.\n\n          While  we have  appellate jurisdiction over  the global\n\nfee award, see In re Nineteen Appeals, 982  F.2d 603, 608-10 (1st\r                                               \n\nCir.  1992), there  is as  yet  no global  costs award.   In  the\n\nordinary  course, the court of appeals may hear appeals only from\n\nfinal orders,  see 28 U.S.C.    1291, and  the orders  entered to\r                            \n\ndate  in respect to costs  are not sufficiently  final to qualify\n\nunder that rubric.\n\n          To  be  sure,  there  are exceptions  to  the  finality\n\nprinciple    but  none are  applicable here.   In  particular, we\n\nreject appellant's  suggestion that the \"common  fund\" exception,\n\nsee In  re Nineteen Appeals, 982 F.2d at 609, pertains.  We think\r                                     \n\nthat  the  exception,  when  other  requirements  are  satisfied,\n                    \r                              \n\n     1The two appeals in question are both appeals from Order No.\n520 (involving the so-called  \"Foulds' expense\").  Neither notice\nof appeal raises any other issues.\n\n                                2\r\r\n\napplies  to global awards, not  to piecemeal interim  orders.  If\n\nevery link in the chain could be appealed separately, chaos would\n\nresult.\n\n          We need go no  further.  We dismiss these  two appeals,\n\nwithout  prejudice, for  want  of appellate  jurisdiction.2   The\n\nissues  raised therein may be  raised anew in  appeals taken from\n\nthe district court's  final (global)  order in  respect to  costs\n\nwhen such an order is entered.\n\nAppeals dismissed.\r          Appeals dismissed.\r                           \n\n                    \r                              \n\n     2To  the extent that the Fee Appeals attempt to raise claims\nrelated  to costs, e.g., Appeal No. 94-1156, which purports to be\r                                 \nan appeal from two orders anent costs (No. 478 and No. 510-A), as\nwell as from  the global award of fees, we  will, when we release\nour opinion  covering those cases, dismiss  without prejudice the\nportions of the appeals relating to the cost orders.\n\n                                3\r\r\n",
