Chapter 214,   2, on  the other hand, vests  the SJC with\r\n\"exclusive [original] jurisdiction of  all civil actions in which\r\nequitable relief  [authorized by statute] is  sought,\" unless the\r                                                                           \r\nstatute expressly  provides that another court  shall have exclu-\r                                                                           \r\nsive  or  concurrent  original  jurisdiction  over  the statutory\r                                                                           \r\nclaims.  Thus, contrary to  Clarke's contention, the bare  refer-\r                \r\nence to superior court \"jurisdiction\" in Section 1C may have been\r\nintended merely to overcome  the automatic \"default\" mechanism in\r\nSection  2    which would  otherwise vest the  SJC with exclusive\r                                                                           \r\noriginal jurisdiction  over all  Section 1C claims  for equitable\r\nrelief     and  to  designate which  other court  (i.e., superior\r                                                                 \r\ncourt) possesses  jurisdiction once  the Section 1C  claimant has\r\nmet the MCAD-exhaustion requirements imposed by FEPA section 9.\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nabsence of) a timely MCAD claim.        Neither  party  cites  to\r\n\nthe legislative history relating to Section 1C, though it appears\r\n\nfairly illuminating.  The legislative bill approved by  the House\r\n\nCommittee on Commerce and Labor (H.5732) represented a compromise\r\n\nmelded from eight competing Senate and House versions relating to\r                           \r\n\nsexual harassment  in employment  and education.

Thus, the ERA enactment may be seen as serving an indepen-\r\n\ndent  function  even after  Charland.   That  is, though  all ERA\r                                              \r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nemployment-based  claims of a type listed in FEPA section 4 would\r                    \r\n\nbe subject  to FEPA's administrative exhaustion  requirement, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nCharland, 631 N.E.2d  at 558-59, non-employment-based ERA  claims\r                                                                   \r\n\nnot listed in FEPA section 4 (if any) might be initiated directly\r\n\nin  the superior  court  without administrative  exhaustion.   By\r\n\ncontrast,  Section 1C  encompasses only sexual  harassment claims\r                                                 \r\n\nwhich are employment-based, compare Mass. Gen.  L.

Clarke reasons, therefore, that unless  Section 1C is\r\n\ninterpreted  as  providing  employment-based   sexual  harassment\r\n\nclaimants an MCAD bypass  into superior court, its  enactment was\r\n\nredundant  and superfluous.  See  Casa Loma, Inc.,  385 N.E.2d at\r                                                           \r\n\n978 (noting  that, where possible,  statutes ought not  be inter-\r\n\npreted so as to render any provision superfluous).  But see supra\r                                                                           \r\n\nnote  7  (investing superior  court  with  jurisdiction over  all\r\n\nexhausted Section 1C claims, as opposed to superior, probate, and\r\n\nhousing courts designated in FEPA section 9).\r\n\n          On the other hand,  KFC points out    correctly  in our\r\n\nview     that the Legislature may well have intended that Section\r\n\n1C  make  all  employment-based  sexual  harassment  unlawful  in\r                                   \r\n\nMassachusetts, without regard to  the number of employees working\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nfor the  particular employer, whereas other  forms of employment-\r                                                                           \r\n\nbased discrimination would  be covered by FEPA  only if practiced\r                              \r\n\nby employers who hire more than  five persons.  See supra note 2.\r                                                                   \r\n\nThis interpretation is  substantiated by the fact that Section 1C\r\n\nis not tied  into FEPA's  definition of \"employer,\"  but only  to\r                                                                       \r\n\nFEPA's  definition  of  \"sexual  harassment.\"    Although  Clarke\r\n\ncounters that the Legislature could have achieved the same result\r\n\nsimply  by amending the FEPA definition of \"employer\" to accommo-\r\n\ndate  this exception,  we are  not persuaded--  nor aware  of any\r\n\nauthority-- that  the amendatory  technique she suggests  was the\r\n\nonly one open to the Legislature. \r\n\n          Clarke further contends that it would be incongruous to\r\n\nrequire  only the  employees of  large-scale employers  to comply\r\n\nwith the MCAD administrative claims process, and not employees of\r\n\nsmall-scale employers, since such an interpretation would contra-\r\n\nvene  the Charland  holding  that all  discrimination claims  are\r                                               \r\n\nsubject  to  the  exhaustion  requirement.   This  contention  is\r\n\ndemonstrably  flawed as  well.   Charland simply  held that  MCAD\r                                                   \r\n\nexhaustion  is  required if  the  claim alleges  an  unlawful act\r\n\nlisted in FEPA section  4.

Absent ambiguity in the  statutory language,\r                    \r\n\nwe think it inappropriate to second-guess the Legislature's clear\r\n\nlanguage establishing broadened protection for victims of  sexual\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nharassment.\r\n\n           Finally,  Clarke argues  that the  Legislature singled\r\n\nout all sexual harassment  claims    from other types  of employ-\r                                                         \r\n\nment-based discrimination  claims  under FEPA     because  sexual\r                                   \r\n\nharassment normally warrants more  urgent remedial action and, by\r\n\naffording sexual harassment victims direct access to the superior\r\n\ncourt, Section  1C would enable more  immediate equitable relief.\r\n\nHer contention is unavailing for two reasons.\r\n\n          First,  Clarke reserved  this  argument  for her  reply\r\n\nbrief on  appeal, thereby denying KFC an  opportunity to respond.\r\n\nSee VanHaaren  v. State Farm Mut.  Auto. Ins. Co., 989  F.2d 1, 7\r                                                           \r\n\nn.6 (1st  Cir. 1993).   Second, even if  it were not  waived, the\r\n\nclaim is meritless  since FEPA already provides the very remedial\r\n\nmechanisms Clarke would have us read into Section  1C.  See Mass.\r                                                                     \r\n\nGen. L.

After  the 1985 amendment,\r\n\nhowever, emotional injuries caused by an employer's \"bona fide []\r\n\npersonnel  action[s]\"      [hereinafter  otherwise:   \"BFPA\"]    \r\n\nliterally became \"noncompensable\" under the workers' compensation\r\n\nstatute.   Consequently, Clarke argues,  if it can be established\r\n\nthat her emotional injuries  were caused by a good  faith, albeit\r                                                                   \r\n\nnegligent, personnel decision on the part of KFC    for which she\r                   \r\n\nwould  not be  entitled to  workers' compensation  benefits under\r\n\nchapter 152, amended section 1(7A), see supra p. 16     she would\r                                                       \r\n\nbe entitled  to redress her  negligence-based tort claims  in the\r\n\ncourts by virtue of  the \"noncompensability\" exception to section\r\n\n24 preemption.\r\n\n          Clarke's argument  cannot succeed, however,  unless she\r\n\ncan  demonstrate both  that (1)  the decision  not to  screen KFC\r                               \r\n\nhirees, nor alter their working  conditions to minimize the  risk\r\n\nthat Clarke  be emotionally harmed by  sexual harassment, consti-\r\n\ntuted  a  \"bona  fide personnel  action\"  within  the meaning  of\r\n\namended section 1(7A); and (2) the 1985 Legislature, in rendering\r                                    \r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nall  BFPA-induced emotional  injuries  noncompensable  under  the\r\n\nworkers' compensation  statute, intended  to deny  BFPA claimants\r\n\nlike Clarke the right  to collect workers' compensation benefits,\r\n\nand,  as an offsetting form  of relief, to  save their common law\r\n\ntort remedies from preemption under  section 24.  Since  Clarke's\r\n\nargument plainly  founders on the second prong, we simply assume,\r\n\narguendo, that the  personnel actions at  issue qualify as  BFPAs\r                  \r\n\nunder amended section 1(7A).\r\n\n          Although there  is no  SJC decision directly  in point,\r\n\nthe interpretation Clarke urges was rejected recently by the Mas-\r\n\nsachusetts Appeals Court,  in Catalano v.

The Catalano court noted that the 1985 amendments to the\r                               \r\n\nworkers'  compensation  statute were  in  direct  response to  an\r\n\ninvitation the SJC extended  to the Legislature in Kelly's  Case:\r                                                                          \r\n\nto \"determine, as  a matter of public policy, whether  one of the\r\n\ncosts of doing business in this Commonwealth shall be the compen-\r\n\nsation of those few employees  who do suffer emotional disability\r\n\nas  a result  of being  laid off  or transferred.\"   Id.  at 1115\r                                                                  \r\n\n(quoting Kelly's Case, 477 N.E.2d at 584-85):\r                               \r\n\n          It is  obvious that the Legislature wished to\r\n          protect the employer from liability under the\r\n          [Workers' Compensation] Act for  claims aris-\r\n          ing out of bona fide personnel actions unless\r\n          motivated  by an intent  to inflict emotional\r\n          distress.  In  those circumstances, it  seems\r\n          unlikely  that  the  Legislature intended  to\r\n          preserve a civil action  for claims based  on\r\n          negligent  infliction  of emotional  distress\r\n          that arise from a bona fide personnel action.\r\n          To  do so would negate  . . .  the purpose of\r\n          relieving employers from  the financial  bur-\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\n          dens of such claims . . . .\r\n\nId. at 1116.\r             \r\n\n          Clarke correctly points out that  the Catalano analysis\r                                                                  \r\n\nconstitutes dicta because  the court dismissed  the appeal on  an\r\n\nalternate ground.
