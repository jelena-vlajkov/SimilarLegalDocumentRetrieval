He  requests that the  case be\n\nremanded  for   an  evidentiary  hearing  on   the  issue  of\n\n\"sentencing factor manipulation.\"\n\n                        I.  Background\r                                                  \n\n     Bonavita pleaded  guilty to two counts  of an indictment\n\ncharging   him  with  conspiracy  to  distribute  cocaine  in\n\nviolation  of  21 U.S.C.    846  (count  two) and  attempt to\n\npossess  with intent  to  distribute  500  grams or  more  of\n\ncocaine  in violation  of  21 U.S.C.     841(b)(1)(B) and  18\n\nU.S.C.    2  (count  four).    Count  two,  although  a  pre-\n\nguidelines offense,  was  included as  \"relevant conduct\"  in\n\narriving at a base offense level.  See U.S.S.G.   1B1.3.  The\r                                                  \n\npre-sentence report calculated a guideline imprisonment range\n\nof 41 to 51 months.  The statutory mandatory minimum sentence\n\nfor  count four, however, was  sixty months. See  28 U.S.C.  \r                                                            \n\n841(b)(1)(B).    Accordingly,  in October,  1992,  the  court\n\nsentenced Bonavita to sixty  months' imprisonment.  The court\n\nfailed to specify the sentence imposed on count two.  \n\n     Bonavita did not appeal.  He filed this   2255 motion in\n\nMay,  1994.    The motion  sought  relief  on  the ground  of\r\r\n\nineffective assistance  of counsel.  He  faulted his attorney\n\nfor failing to raise the following arguments at sentencing or\n\non appeal: 1) that \"sentencing factor manipulation\"  entitled\n\nBonavita to a departure from the guideline sentence; 2)  that\n\nthe court erroneously believed it lacked discretion to impose\n\na sentence below the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by\n\nstatute; and 3) that  the district court erred in  failing to\n\nspecify the sentence imposed for Count Two. Bonavita's motion\n\nfocused  primarily on  the sentencing  manipulation argument,\n\nsuggesting  that   the  government  may   have  proposed  the\n\n\"outrageously  low price of $6,500\" for a kilogram of cocaine\n\nfor  the purpose  of inducing  Bonavita to  deal in  a larger\n\nquantity of  cocaine than was his  custom, thereby triggering\n\nthe   statutorily   prescribed  ten-year   mandatory  minimum\n\nsentence.\n\n     On  May  17,  1994,   the  district  court  ordered  the\n\ngovernment to  respond  to Bonavita's     2255 motion.    The\n\ngovernment filed an opposition on July 14, 1994.  In response\n\nto  the  sentencing  manipulation  argument,  the  government\n\nattached  to  its  opposition  a declaration  under  oath  by\n\nSpecial  Agent   Sean  McDonough  of  the   Drug  Enforcement\n\nAdministration  (\"the  McDonough affidavit\"),  the undercover\n\nagent who made the attempted sale to Bonavita.  The McDonough\n\naffidavit  stated  that  Bonavita and  co-defendant  Michelle\n\nMalloy had  agreed to  purchase the  kilogram of cocaine  for\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n$17,000,  with  a  $10,000  downpayment  to  be  followed  by\n\ndelivery of  the balance  after distribution of  the cocaine.\n\nMcDonough also stated in the  affidavit that Malloy later met\n\nwith him to explain that she and Bonavita could only  come up\n\nwith a $6,500 down payment.\n\n     In  a memorandum  and  order dated  July  19, 1994,  the\n\ndistrict court denied Bonavita's   2255 motion.  Bonavita, in\n\nresponse to the government's opposition  and affidavit, filed\n\na  motion  requesting  an opportunity  to  respond  or  for a\n\nhearing.  That  motion, dated  July 20, 1994,  was denied  on\n\nAugust 1, 1994,  on the  ground that the  district court  had\n\nalready denied the   2255 motion.\n\n                      II.  Discussion   \r                                                 \n\n     \"To succeed  in setting  aside a conviction  premised on\n\nineffective   assistance  of   counsel,  a   petitioner  must\n\nestablish  both constitutionally deficient performance on his\n\nattorney's  part  and  concomitant  prejudice,   or,  phrased\n\nanother way,  that the quality of legal representation at his\n\ntrial was so inferior as to  be objectively unreasonable, and\n\nthat this incompetent lawyering  redounded to his substantial\n\ndetriment.\" United  States v.

See\r                                                                         \n\nCastiello,  915 F.2d  at 5  n.10.   \"[T]he burden  of showing\r                     \n\nsentencing factor  manipulation  rests with  the  defendant.\"\n\nUnited States v. Gibbens, 25 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1994). The\r                                    \n\nonly evidentiary  support that  Bonavita has offered  for the\n\nsentencing manipulation  argument, either in  his petition or\n\nin   his  briefs,   is  the  pre-sentence   report  (\"PSR\").1\n\nBonavita  alleges that the PSR states that the $6,500 was the\n\nfull purchase price.  Our review of the PSR, however, reveals\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Bonavita  refers to  a government \"de-briefing\"  in which\nMalloy allegedly stated  that $6,500  represented the  entire\npurchase  price.   Neither in  his motion  to respond  to the\ngovernment's opposition,  nor  in his  briefs,  however,  has\nBonavita suggested  that Malloy would have  testified to this\neffect,  or even  that  Bonavita himself  would testify  that\n$6,500 was the full, agreed-upon purchase price.\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nthat  it fails  to  contain any  such  statement.   The  only\n\nreference to the $6,500 in the PSR is as follows:\n\n          Bonavita  and Malloy  agreed  to buy  one\n          kilogram  of  cocaine  and  pooled  their\n          money to make  the purchase from  Special\n          Agent McDonough.  Malloy  delivered $6500\n          to McDonough at a  shopping plaza in  the\n          North  End of Springfield on December 23,\n          1987.\n\nThis quote is far from a definitive statement that the $6,500\n\nrepresented the full purchase price and, in  fact, is equally\n\nconsistent with  a finding that the $6,500 represented a down\n\npayment.     The   McDonough   affidavit   directly   refutes\n\nappellant's allegation that  the $6,500 represented  the full\n\npurchase price.  Given  the \"inadequate factual  foundation,\"\n\nConnell,  960   F.2d  at  195,  for   the  sentencing  factor\r                   \n\nmanipulation  argument in  this  case,  counsel's failure  to\n\nraise the issue did not constitute ineffective assistance.\n\n     The district  court  denied Bonavita's    2255  petition\n\nonly  five days  after the  government filed  its opposition,\n\nleaving  little time  for Bonavita,  a pro se  petitioner, to\r                                                         \n\nrespond thereto.  Nonetheless, the district court did not err\n\nin denying the   2255 motion without a hearing where Bonavita\n\nfailed  to give  any indication  of how  he would  refute the\n\nMcDonough affidavit.  Even now, Bonavita relies solely on the\n\nPSR,   which  clearly  does   not  contradict  the  McDonough\n\naffidavit.   No sworn statments or  other offers of testimony\n\nhave been made.     \"When a petition is brought under   2255,\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nthe petitioner bears the burden of  establishing the need for\n\nan  evidentiary hearing.\" United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d at\r                                                             \n\n225.  An evidentiary hearing is  not necessary where a   2255\n\nmotion \"although facially adequate is conclusively refuted as\n\nto the alleged facts by the  files and records of the  case.\"\n\nUnited  States v. McGill, 11  F.3d 223, 226  (1st Cir. 1993).\r                                    \n\nHere, the  district court supportably found  that appellant's\n\nallegation that the  $6,500 represented  the entire  purchase\n\nprice  was  conclusively  refuted  by  DEA Agent  McDonough's\n\ndetailed sworn statement.   Therefore, the district court did\n\nnot err in refusing to grant an evidentiary hearing.\n\n     B. Failure to Depart Below Mandatory Minimum Sentence\r                                                                      \n\n     For the  reasons stated by the  district court, Bonavita\n\nhas not established that his attorney's failure to argue that\n\nthe  district  court  could   impose  a  sentence  below  the\n\nstatutory   minimum   constituted   ineffective   assistance.\n\nBonavita pleaded guilty to count four of the indictment which\n\ncharged him with \n\nattempting to possess with intent to  distribute 500 grams or\n\nmore  of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.   841(b)(1)(B) and\n\n18 U.S.C.   2.   The conduct underlying the  offense occurred\n\nin December, 1987. \n\n     Section  841(b)(1)(B), mandating  a minimum  sentence of\n\nfive years'  imprisonment for violations  involving 500 grams\n\nor more of cocaine, went into effect on October 27, 1986. See\r                                                                         \n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nGozlon-Peretz v. United States,  498 U.S. 395, 404-07 (1991).\r                                          \n\nIt is  therefore indisputable that the  statutory minimum was\n\nin effect at the time that  the offense charged in count four\n\noccurred  (and at the time that the offenses charged in count\n\ntwo   occurred  as   well).     A   defendant's  \"substantial\n\nassistance\" in  investigating or prosecuting another,  see 18\r                                                                      \n\nU.S.C.   3553(e),  \"is virtually the  only occasion on  which\n\nthe statutory minimums may  be disregarded.\" United States v.\r                                                                      \n\nTorres, 33 F.3d 130,  131 (1st Cir. 1994), cert.  denied,    \r                                                                    \n\nU.S.    , 115 S.Ct.  767 (1995).  Bonavita does  not claim to\n\nhave provided such assistance.  Therefore, the district court\n\nhad  no discretion  to sentence  Bonavita to  less than  five\n\nyears  for  count four.   His    attorney's failure  to argue\n\notherwise was not ineffective assistance.   \n\n     C. Failure to Specify Sentence for Count Two\r                                                             \n\n     According to the pre-sentence report, the plea agreement\n\nprovided that the government would recommend  with respect to\n\ncount  two  that  the  sentence  run  concurrently  with  the\n\nsentence  imposed on  count  four.   It  is implicit  in  the\n\ndistrict  court's sentencing  order that  the court  accepted\n\nthat recommendation.  Even if it  was error for  the district\n\ncourt not to specify the sentence, the failure could not have\n\nprejudiced   Bonavita.    The   five-year  sentence  Bonavita\n\nreceived for  count four  was the mandatory  minimum sentence\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nunder the applicable statute.  Therefore, the prejudice prong\n\nof the Strickland test has not been satisfied.\r                             \n\n     The denial of Bonavita's   2255 petition is affirmed.\r                                                                     \n\n                             -9-\r\r\n",

Count two, although a pre-guidelines offense, was included as \"relevant conduct\" in arriving at a base offense level.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3.

Bonavita's motion focused primarily on the sentencing manipulation argument, suggesting that the government may have proposed the \"outrageously low price of $6,500\" for a kilogram of cocaine for the purpose of inducing Bonavita to deal in a larger quantity of cocaine than was his custom, thereby triggering the statutorily prescribed ten-year mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 17, 1994, the district court ordered the government to respond to Bonavita's Sec. 2255 motion.

In response to the sentencing manipulation argument, the government attached to its opposition a declaration under oath by Special Agent Sean McDonough of the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"the McDonough affidavit\"), the undercover agent who made the attempted sale to Bonavita.  The McDonough affidavit stated that Bonavita and co-defendant Michelle Malloy had agreed to purchase the kilogram of cocaine for $17,000, with a $10,000 downpayment to be followed by delivery of the balance after distribution of the cocaine.

Bonavita pleaded guilty to count four of the indictment which charged him with attempting to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.

It is therefore indisputable that the statutory minimum was in effect at the time that the offense charged in count four occurred (and at the time that the offenses charged in count two occurred as well).

Sec. 846 (count two) and attempt to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(B) and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2 (count four).  Count two, although a pre-guidelines offense, was included as \"relevant conduct\" in arriving at a base offense level.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3.  The pre-sentence report calculated a guideline imprisonment range of 41 to 51 months.  The statutory mandatory minimum sentence for count four, however, was sixty months.  See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(B).  Accordingly, in October, 1992, the court sentenced Bonavita to sixty months' imprisonment.
