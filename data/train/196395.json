Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                                \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                     Selya, Cyr and Stahl,\r\n                       Circuit Judges.\r                                                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\nJerome E. Cassell on Motion for Summary Disposition pro se.\r                             \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  We  have before us appellant Cassell's\r                                \r\n\n\"Motion  to  Compel  Enforcement  and  Compliance,\" which  we\r\n\nconstrue as requesting relief from briefing requirements, and\r\n\na summary disposition of the appeal.  \r\n\n          Cassell  was  convicted  in a  New  Hampshire state\r\n\ncourt  of  felonious  sexual  assault.   While  his  criminal\r\n\nconviction  was pending  on direct  appeal, he  filed several\r\n\nactions  in federal district  court under  42 U.S.C.    1983,\r\n\nchallenging  the  validity  of  the  conviction  and  seeking\r\n\nequitable  relief and damages.   Three of the  suits were the\r\n\nsubject  of an opinion issued  by this court  in April, 1994.\r\n\nCassell v. Osborn, No. 93-1557, etc., Slip op. (1st Cir. Apr.\r                             \r\n\n26, 1994).  There we affirmed the district court's  dismissal\r\n\nof  most of  Cassell's claims,  but vacated  those dismissals\r\n\nwhich  were  arguably  susceptible  of  being  raised  as  an\r\n\nestoppel in the  state proceedings.   The latter claims  were\r\n\nremanded  for reconsideration  as to  whether they  should be\r\n\ndismissed  or  stayed pending  the  conclusion  of the  state\r\n\nappeal.   Id. at 13.  The  district court decided to stay the\r                         \r\n\nclaims.\r\n\n          Pursuant   to   the  Supreme   Court's  intervening\r\n\ndecision in Heck  v. Humphrey,  114 S. Ct.  2364 (1994),  the\r                                         \r\n\ndistrict  court  later  granted  a motion  by  defendants  to\r\n\ndismiss the claims.   In Heck, the Court resolved  a conflict\r                                         \r\n\namong the circuits  by ruling that \"a   1983  cause of action\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nfor  damages attributable  to an  unconstitutional conviction\r\n\ndoes  not  accrue  until  the  conviction  .  .  .  has  been\r                             \r\n\ninvalidated.\"  Heck, 114 S. Ct. at 2373 (emphasis added); see\r                                                                         \r\n\nalso  Guzman-Rivera v.  Rivera-Cruz, 29 F.3d  3, 5  (1st Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1994).  \r\n\n          Appellant  is   mistaken  in  his  belief   that  a\r\n\ndismissal under  Heck violates this court's  earlier mandate.\r                                 \r\n\nThis dismissal will not prejudice the resolution of any issue\r\n\npending before  the state's appellate  court.  It  means only\r\n\nthat  his    1983  suit is  premature.   As  we  explained in\r\n\nresponse to another, similar appeal by Cassell, the dismissal\r\n\nalso \"does not  prevent him  from later filing  a proper  and\r\n\ntimely  complaint  for damages  should  he  first succeed  in\r\n\nhaving his conviction reversed on direct appeal, expunged, or\r\n\notherwise declared  invalid by a tribunal  authorized to make\r\n\nsuch a determination.\"   Cassell v.  Ober, No. 94-1796,  slip\r                                                     \r\n\nop. at 2 (1st  Cir.
