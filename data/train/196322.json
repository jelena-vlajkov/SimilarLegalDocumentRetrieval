We have before us cross-appeals\r                                      \r\n\nin  a case concerning  long-distance moving arrangements that\r\n\nwent seriously  awry.  The  plaintiffs in the  district court\r\n\nwere Paul and Doris Fredette; the defendants were Allied  Van\r\n\nLines, Inc., (\"Allied\"), Mullen Brothers, Inc. of North Adams\r\n\n(\"Mullen  Brothers\")  and  Transit  Homes  of  America,  Inc.\r\n\n(\"Transit\").  The facts, taken in the light most favorable to\r\n\nthe  jury verdict, Borden v.  Paul Revere Life  Ins. Co., 935\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 370, 379 (1st Cir. 1991), are as follows.\r\n\n     In September 1990, General Electric Company (\"GE\")  laid\r\n\noff Paul Fredette, who was then working as a machinist in its\r\n\nPittsfield, Massachusetts, plant.  GE offered Paul Fredette a\r\n\nposition  in  its  Hickory,  North  Carolina  plant,  and  he\r\n\naccepted.  The Fredettes  contacted defendant Mullen Brothers\r\n\nto arrange the move  of their mobile home to  North Carolina.\r\n\nMullen  is  a local  Massachusetts  mover  licensed only  for\r\n\nintrastate moves;  for interstate moves  like the Fredettes',\r\n\nMullen acts as an agent for Allied.\r\n\n     In  January 1991,  a Mullen  sales  representative, Chad\r\n\nLindburg, came  to the Fredettes' Pittsfield  home to inspect\r\n\nand inventory their mobile home and personal belongings.  The\r\n\nmobile home was a one-bedroom unit with an attached porch and\r\n\ncanopy  and  a  detached  shed. The  Fredettes  explained  to\r\n\nLindburg  that they  wanted to move  the home and  all of its\r\n\ncontents and that  they wanted  to be fully  insured.   After\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nthat  meeting,  the Fredettes  left  for  North Carolina  and\r\n\nstayed with relatives  while Paul Fredette began work  at the\r\n\nGE plant there.  They also purchased a lot for the home.\r\n\n     In  mid-February, the  Fredettes returned and  signed an\r\n\nagreement with Lindburg committing  Allied to move the mobile\r\n\nhome and its  contents at  a cost of  $20,520; the  Fredettes\r\n\nhanded over  a check,  apparently believing that  this amount\r\n\nrepresented  all  payments required  for  the  move.   Allied\r\n\nplanned to  transport the  household possessions itself.   It\r\n\nsubcontracted  the  move of  the mobile  home to  Transit and\r\n\nhired  another company to move the porch and shed.  According\r\n\nto the contract, the move was to begin on  February 16, 1991,\r\n\nwith a guaranteed  delivery date no  later than February  25,\r\n\n1991.\r\n\n     Transit, in turn, hired James Bedford to move the mobile\r\n\nhome and  he inspected  it on the  day that the  contract was\r\n\nsigned.  The Fredettes  then returned to North Carolina.   On\r\n\nFebruary  21,  1991,  Lindburg  told them  that  Bedford  had\r\n\ndiscovered pre-existing  structural damage after he moved the\r\n\nhome off its Pittsfield  lot.  Bedford told Transit  that the\r\n\nhome  was not roadworthy because it was sagging on its axles.\r\n\nTransit told Bedford  not to  move the home  and told  Allied\r\n\nthat  the  home  would  not  be  moved  until  the  Fredettes\r\n\nfurnished  Transit  with  a  broad liability  release.    The\r\n\nFredettes' personal belongings were placed in storage.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     The Fredettes returned  to Pittsfield, photographed  the\r\n\nhome  and   hired  their  own  expert,   Stanley  Bator,  who\r\n\ndetermined  that the home could  be safely moved  if a fourth\r\n\naxle were added.   The  Fredettes refused to  sign the  broad\r\n\nrelease  demanded by  Transit, but  on March  1, 1991,  Doris\r\n\nFredette  signed a promissory note to Allied for up to $2,500\r\n\nto  cover costs of adding an axle.   A fourth axle was added,\r\n\nand on March 7, 1991, Bedford moved the home from Pittsfield,\r\n\narriving  in North  Carolina on  March 12.   On  arrival, the\r\n\nFredettes and  an expert they hired  found (and photographed)\r\n\nsubstantial damage to the interior and exterior of the home.\r\n\n     Bedford  refused to  place the  mobile home  on the  lot\r\n\nuntil  the   Fredettes  removed   a  fence  and   made  other\r\n\nadjustments.  The  Fredettes hired Irvin Finger,  who did the\r\n\nrequired work,  but Bedford still  refused to  move the  home\r\n\nonto the lot,  saying that the ground was too hilly and muddy\r\n\nto do it safely.   After consulting with Allied  and Transit,\r\n\nBedford left the  mobile home  near the lot  and returned  to\r\n\nMassachusetts.   The  Fredettes hired  a local  company which\r\n\npromptly placed the home onto the lot for an additional fee.\r\n\n     A  week  later,  after  a  number  of  requests  by  the\r\n\nFredettes,  Allied sent a crew  to block and  level the home.\r\n\nThe contents of the  home and the porch, including  the front\r\n\nsteps, had  not  yet  arrived.   Apparently  Allied  and  the\r\n\nFredettes were engaged  in a dispute  about the storage  fees\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nincurred  during  the moving  delay,  and  Allied refused  to\r\n\ndeliver  the personal  belongings until  the storage  fee was\r\n\npaid.  Delivery occurred on April 11, 1991, and the Fredettes\r\n\nmoved  into  their  home the  next  day,  45  days after  the\r\n\noriginal guaranteed delivery date.\r\n\n     While  the  home  was  en route,  Paul  Fredette  became\r\n\ndepressed  and, as a result, was terminated from his job with\r\n\nGE.   His anxiety and depression continued after the move and\r\n\nwere confirmed by medical testimony at trial.  He returned to\r\n\nwork  in  May of  1991, but  left  again in  September, again\r\n\nbecause  of  depression.     Doris  Fredette   also  suffered\r\n\nemotional distress.  Ultimately,  the Fredettes brought  suit\r\n\nin  Massachusetts state  court, alleging  a number  of claims\r\n\nagainst Allied, Transit and Mullen.\r\n\n     The  defendants  removed the  suit  to  federal district\r\n\ncourt,  and  ultimately the  parties  went to  trial  on four\r\n\ncounts:    count  I  alleged  a  violation   of  the  Carmack\r\n\nAmendment, 49  U.S.C.    11707; count  II  charged breach  of\r\n\ncontract;  count IV  alleged  a  violation  of  Massachusetts\r\n\nconsumer  protection law, Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93A, based on the\r\n\nintentional  infliction of  emotional distress;  and count  V\r\n\ncharged intentional infliction of emotional distress.1\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1Count III,  a state-law claim for  property damage, was\r\ndismissed as preempted by the Carmack Amendment.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n     Counts I, II and V were tried to a  jury beginning April\r\n\n11,  1994; Count  IV, the 93A  claim, was heard  by the court\r\n\nafterward.   After the  Fredettes rested, the  district court\r\n\ndismissed Mullen as  a party.   On April 14,  1994, the  jury\r\n\nfound for the Fredettes  and against Allied on the  breach of\r\n\ncontract  claim and  the claim  of intentional  infliction of\r\n\nemotional  distress.  It found  for the Fredettes and against\r\n\nTransit on  the  Carmack Amendment  claim  and the  claim  of\r\n\nintentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress.   The  jury\r\n\nawarded   $36,000,  representing   $18,500  on   the  Carmack\r\n\nAmendment claim against Transit; $7,500 on the contract claim\r\n\nagainst Allied;  and $5,000 each against  these defendants on\r\n\nthe emotional distress claim.  The district court then  found\r\n\nin favor of Allied and Transit on the Fredettes' 93A claim.\r\n\n     Allied  and  Transit   duly  filed  post-trial  motions,\r\n\ngenerally  preserving  the claims  now  made  on appeal,  but\r\n\nmotions  were denied.  Allied and Transit now appeal from the\r\n\njudgments against  them.  The Fredettes cross appeal from the\r\n\nrejection  of their  claim  against Mullen  and the  district\r\n\ncourt's denial of their 93A claim.  \r\n\n     1.  The Carmack Amendment Claim.  The Carmack Amendment,\r                                                \r\n\n49  U.S.C.    11707,  incorporates common  law principles  of\r\n\nliability and makes  a common carrier liable  for \"the actual\r\n\nloss  or   injury  to   the  property\"  that   it  transports\r\n\ninterstate.  Id.    11707(a)(1).  Transit was responsible for\r                            \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nthe  move  of  the mobile  home,  and  the  jury awarded  the\r\n\nFredettes $18,500  against Transit  for damages to  the home.\r\n\nTransit  argues   that  the  Fredettes   failed  to   present\r\n\nsufficient  evidence of the damages  to take the  case to the\r\n\njury;   alternatively  it   seeks  remittitur   or,   in  the\r\n\nalternative, a new trial on the issue of damages.\r\n\n     A  plaintiff  suing  under  the  Carmack  Amendment  may\r\n\nrecover as damages  only the  \"actual loss or  injury to  the\r\n\nproperty,\" ordinarily  measured  either by  the reduction  in\r\n\nmarket value caused  by the  defendant or  by replacement  or\r\n\nrepair costs occasioned by the harm.  See, e.g., Oak Hall Cap\r                                                                         \r\n\n&amp; Gown Co., Inc. v. Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., 899 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n291,  296 (4th  Cir. 1990).   There is no  recovery under the\r\n\nstatute for punitive damages or  for damages unrelated to the\r\n\nproperty at  issue.  Cleveland  v. Beltman  North Amer.  Co.,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc., 30 F.3d 373, 379 (2d  Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115  S.\r                                                                \r\n\nCt. 901 (1995).\r\n\n     Evidence as to the nature and extent of physical damages\r\n\nsustained by the home  move was presented primarily  by Doris\r\n\nand   Paul  Fredette  and  by  Irvin  Finger;  Finger  was  a\r\n\ncontractor  who  had  examined  the home  at  the  Fredettes'\r\n\nrequest  when it arrived in North Carolina and compared it to\r\n\nphotographs  of   the  home  taken  on   the  Pittsfield  lot\r\n\nimmediately prior  to the move.   Finger  supplied a  written\r\n\nlist  of  repair tasks  and  a  proposed  price  of  $10,500.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\n\"Before and after\" photographs of the home were also admitted\r\n\ninto evidence.\r\n\n     Although Transit  argues that little  beyond normal wear\r\n\nand tear  was demonstrated,  the  jury was  entitled to  find\r\n\notherwise.  The Fredettes described the condition of the home\r\n\nbefore the  move and after,  testifying to the  broken window\r\n\nand  door casing,  missing shingles,  soiled rugs,  damage to\r\n\naluminum siding and to  the roof, a broken sink,  and similar\r\n\ninjuries discovered  when the move was over.  Another witness\r\n\nconfirmed the existence of damage to the roof and an exterior\r\n\nwall.     The  jury   was  also  entitled   to  consider  the\r\n\nphotographs.  Thus, there was ample proof of injury.\r\n\n     What is of more concern is the amount of damages awarded\r\n\nby the  jury for injury  to the  mobile home.   Even assuming\r\n\nthat the jury fully accepted Finger's estimate, the  award of\r\n\n$18,500 against  Transit--or $8,350 in excess  of the damages\r\n\nestimated  by   him--is  puzzling.     Possibly,  as  Transit\r\n\nspeculates, the jury included other damages for which Transit\r\n\nwas not liable (e.g., damage to the porch and shed which were\r                                \r\n\nmoved  by another company), although the figures do not quite\r\n\nmesh.   But  Transit  has  not  claimed  that  the  jury  was\r\n\nmisinstructed, so we  have to assume  that the jury  intended\r\n\nthe award to cover the mobile home itself.\r\n\n     That presents the question whether the jury was entitled\r\n\nto  take the descriptions and  photographs of the injuries to\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nthe mobile home  and then  value those  injuries more  highly\r\n\nthan  the  amount assigned  by  the  Fredettes' own  witness.\r\n\nUnder the  case law, the jury  can depart upward, as  well as\r\n\ndownward, from the opinion of the expert; and this makes good\r\n\nsense  wherever the  jury  could reasonably  have valued  the\r\n\ndamage without any  expert opinion.2   The jury  could do  so\r\n\nfor  a broken  window or  dented fender;  a  defective dynamo\r\n\nwould probably be beyond its ken.\r\n\n     The  injuries to the mobile home are in between but much\r\n\ncloser to the broken window.  The injuries here (e.g., soiled\r                                                                 \r\n\nrugs, repainting,  damaged  sidings  and  roof,  broken  door\r\n\nframe) were  not especially  exotic in character  and nothing\r\n\nprevented  the jurors  from  using their  own experience  and\r\n\ncommon sense  to adjust upward  or downward the  expert's own\r\n\nestimate.  The award was certainly very generous, in light of\r\n\nFinger's testimony, and a remittitur could have been ordered;\r\n\nbut it  is hard to  say that  it was irrational  or that  the\r\n\nrefusal to grant a new trial or remittitur on damages was  an\r\n\nabuse of discretion.\r\n\n     2.   The  Contract  Claim.   The  Fredettes also  won  a\r                                          \r\n\njudgment  of $7,500  against  Allied for  breach of  contract\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2See, e.g., Weber v.

The trial judge  described the elements  of\r\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress as follows:\r\n\n     First, that  the defendants  intended to  cause, or\r\n     should  have  known that  its  [sic] conduct  would\r\n     cause  emotional  distress; and,  Second,  that the\r\n     defendants'  conduct  was  extreme and  outrageous;\r\n     and, Third,  that  the actions  of  the  defendants\r\n     caused plaintiffs distress;  and, Fourth, that  the\r\n     plaintiffs   suffered   emotional  distress.     In\r\n     determining whether a defendants' [sic] conduct was\r\n     extreme   and  utterly  outrageous,  you  must  ask\r\n     yourselves  whether  the  conduct  was  beyond  all\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\n     bounds  of  decency and  utterly  intolerable  in a\r\n     civilized community.  Liability can't be founded on\r\n     mere insults, threats, or annoyances.  It should be\r\n     noted that physical harm to the plaintiffs in [sic]\r\n     not a required element of this claim.\r\n\n     The  district  court's  instructions  are  taken  almost\r\n\nverbatim from a recent  decision by the Massachusetts Supreme\r\n\nJudicial  Court, Sena  v. Commonwealth,  629 N.E.2d  986, 994\r                                                  \r\n\n(Mass.  1994).    In  this  case,  the  defendants  submitted\r\n\nproposed instructions that would have required, on the fourth\r\n\nelement, that the plaintiffs' emotional distress  be \"severe\"\r\n\nand  \"of a nature that no reasonable person could be expected\r               \r\n\nto  endure it.\"   That  language is  taken from  that court's\r\n\nwatershed decision on the tort  nearly twenty years ago, Agis\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

The district court declined to include\r\n\nthe \"reasonable  person\" language,  and an objection  to this\r\n\nomission was preserved.3\r\n\n     Since Agis, the SJC has all but  ignored the \"reasonable\r                           \r\n\nperson\" language.  Every  time that the court has  decided an\r\n\nintentional infliction  claim since Agis, it  has omitted the\r                                                    \r\n\n\"reasonable   person\"  language   and  simply   required  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     3The judge apparently intended to use the word \"severe,\"\r\nbut may  well have failed to  do so.  The  transcript and the\r\ncourt's  post-trial memorandum  and  order  are seemingly  in\r\nconflict.  But  if \"severe\" was omitted, no  proper objection\r\nwas preserved.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\nplaintiff to show \"severe\"  emotional distress.4  This  is so\r\n\neven in cases where the severity of the plaintiff's emotional\r\n\ndistress is at  issue.   See, e.g., Haddad  v. Gonzalez,  576\r                                                                   \r\n\nN.E.2d 658, 667-68 (Mass. 1991).  Because the district  court\r\n\ndefined the tort  precisely as the state's  highest court has\r\n\ndone for more  than a  decade, we  find no  error, much  less\r\n\nprejudicial error.\r\n\n     Both  Allied  and Transit  also  contend  that they  are\r\n\nentitled to  judgment as a  matter of law  or a new  trial on\r\n\nthis claim.

In  part, this  argument rests on  an effort  to\r\n\ndisassociate  themselves from Bedford,  who refused  to place\r\n\nthe home  on the lot  even after  the Fredettes had  made the\r\n\ninitial adjustment  Bedford  demanded.    But  the  Fredettes\r\n\npresented  evidence  that  Transit  had   ratified  Bedford's\r\n\ndemands that the North Carolina lot be levelled  further, and\r\n\nthat Transit  and Allied  had approved Bedford's  decision to\r\n\nleave the site with the home still not in place.\r\n\n     There  was other  conduct of  which the jury  might have\r\n\ndisapproved.   Transit took the  lead in seeking  to obtain a\r\n\nrelease from  the Fredettes  that seemingly went  well beyond\r\n\nthe  danger that occasioned the demand.  Allied waited a week\r\n\nbefore sending  a crew to block  and level the  site once the\r\n\nhome was moved to  North Carolina, and it waited  three weeks\r\n\nmore to deliver  the Fredettes'  belongings (including  their\r\n\ncar,  furniture  and the  steps  to  their  home)  until  the\r\n\nFredettes paid the disputed storage charges.\r\n\n       Most  of  the  Massachusetts  cases  cited  to  us  by\r\n\ndefendants are distinguishable, but  Transit has a  plausible\r\n\nargument  that the conduct here  is not much  worse than that\r\n\nheld insufficient in  Foley v. Polaroid Corp.,  508 N.E.2d 72\r                                                         \r\n\n(Mass.  1987); there,  an employee  acquitted of  assault was\r\n\nsidetracked  in his  job and  ostracized by  other employees.\r\n\nStill, in  Foley the SJC  thought that  the company's  formal\r                            \r\n\nactions were consistent with \"a good faith effort to maintain\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\nFoley's  employment  in a  manner consistent  with Polaroid's\r\n\nlegitimate  business  concerns,\" id.  at  82;  and the  court\r                                                \r\n\napparently  equated   the  harassment  with   \"mere  insults,\r\n\nindignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other\r\n\ntrivialities\" for which recovery  is not permitted under this\r\n\nclaim.  Id.\r                       \r\n\n     Here,  we think  that  the jury  was entitled,  although\r\n\nhardly compelled,  to  find bad  faith;  and the  delays  and\r\n\nwithholding of  property and services go  somewhat beyond the\r\n\nverbal  and  other  minor  abuses  that  Polaroid   employees\r\n\ndirected against Foley.  Further, given the interplay between\r\n\nAllied, Transit  and Bedford, the  jury was entitled  to view\r\n\nthe conduct as a whole and not as isolated minor  wrongs.  So\r\n\nviewed, we think  that the  deference to be  accorded to  the\r\n\njury's judgment on issues of this kind keeps the verdict just\r\n\nthis side of the dividing line. \r\n\n     4.    The  Fredettes'  93A Claim.    The  Fredettes also\r                                                 \r\n\nclaimed   against    the   defendants   for    violation   of\r\n\nMassachusetts'  far-reaching  consumer protection  law, Mass.\r\n\nGen.  L. ch. 93A.   That law proscribes  \"unfair or deceptive\r\n\nacts  or practices in the  conduct of any  trade or commerce\"\r\n\nand  provides  a  private   right  of  action  for  aggrieved\r\n\nindividuals.  The 93A  claim was tried to the  district court\r\n\nafter the  jury verdict on the other counts.  The court found\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n\nthat no violation  had occurred,  and ruled in  favor of  the\r\n\ndefendants.  The Fredettes argue that this ruling was error.\r\n\n     Although  93A is  phrased  in terms  different than  the\r\n\nemotional distress tort, the  analogy is closer than language\r\n\nmight suggest.  The \"unfair or deceptive\" label sounds like a\r\n\nvery  low  threshold,  but   the  Massachusetts  courts  have\r\n\nrepeatedly held  that 93A  requires conduct that  is immoral,\r\n\nunethical  or unscrupulous or  at least  attains \"a  level of\r\n\nrascality\" that  goes  well beyond  ordinary  tough  business\r\n\npractice.

Whether  or\r\n\nnot  the judge's findings can be squared with the jury's does\r\n\nnot  matter, so long as the former's findings are not clearly\r\n\nerroneous and the latter's  are within the bounds  of reason.\r\n\nWallace  Motor Sales, Inc. v. American Motor Sales Corp., 780\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 1049, 1063-64  (1st Cir. 1985).   Precisely because this\r\n\nis a borderline case, we think that the respective  standards\r\n\nof review protect both factfinders.\r\n\n     The Fredettes  also rely on  a regulation issued  by the\r\n\nMassachusetts Attorney General  which provides that  \"[i]t is\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n\nan  unfair and deceptive act or practice: (a) To advertise or\r\n\npromise prompt delivery where  delivery is neither prompt nor\r\n\nexpeditious.\"  940 C.M.R. 3.15.  But we read this to refer to\r\n\na pattern of conduct,  or at least to an  individual occasion\r\n\nin  which  the  promisor  knows  that  it  is  making  untrue\r\n\nrepresentations.   Whatever other  criticisms may be  made of\r\n\nAllied, nothing suggests that  its original delivery date was\r\n\na representation made in bad faith.\r\n\n     The  Fredettes'  other  theory  is  that the  defendants\r\n\nbehaved unfairly  and deceptively by specifying  a price that\r\n\nthe Fredettes believed to  be all-inclusive and then imposing\r\n\na  succession of  additional charges  and demands  (e.g., the\r                                                                    \r\n\nstorage fees, expenses  relating to  the new lot).   But  the\r\n\ndistrict judge  as the trier of  fact was entitled to  take a\r\n\nmore benign  view  and  regard  these extra  demands  as  not\r\n\nclearly  beyond  what was  agreed  to  or  as  occasioned  by\r\n\ndevelopments that no one had  foreseen.  This view,  although\r\n\nnot compelled, was not clearly erroneous.\r\n\n     5.   The Dismissal  of Mullen.

Lindburg, they say,  acted as the  agent for both\r\n\nMullen and Allied; and Mullen is responsible, they argue, for\r\n\nthe wrongs  they attribute to  Lindburg.   These wrongs  they\r\n\nidentify as (1) misadvising the Fredettes that their move was\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\n\"fully covered\"  and \"fully insured\" and  (2) mishandling the\r\n\noriginal inspection and measurements  of the home and thereby\r\n\ncausing a significant portion of the delay in the move.\r\n\n     It  is not clear why  this claimed error  matters to the\r\n\nFredettes since  Allied and  Transit are presumably  solvent,\r\n\nand  the Fredettes cannot collect twice  for the same wrongs.\r\n\nBut in any event  we see little indication that  Lindburg was\r\n\nindependently culpable: there is no evidence that he told the\r\n\nFredettes anything he had reason to believe to be untrue; and\r\n\nthe  Fredettes point us to  nothing in the  record that would\r\n\nshow  that Lindburg knew or should have known that the mobile\r\n\nhome would sag when removed from its supports.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \r\n\n                             -19-\r                                         -19-\r\r\n",

The plaintiffs in the district court were Paul and Doris Fredette;  the defendants were Allied Van Lines, Inc., (\"Allied\"), Mullen Brothers, Inc. of North Adams (\"Mullen Brothers\") and Transit Homes of America, Inc.  (\"Transit\").  The facts, taken in the light most favorable to the jury verdict, Borden v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 935 F.2d 370, 379 (1st Cir.1991), are as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1990, General Electric Company (\"GE\") laid off Paul Fredette, who was then working as a machinist in its Pittsfield, Massachusetts, plant.  GE offered Paul Fredette a position in its Hickory, North Carolina plant, and he accepted.  The Fredettes contacted defendant Mullen Brothers to arrange the move of their mobile home to North Carolina.  Mullen is a local Massachusetts mover licensed only for intrastate moves;  for interstate moves like the Fredettes', Mullen acts as an agent for Allied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1991, a Mullen sales representative, Chad Lindburg, came to the Fredettes' Pittsfield home to inspect and inventory their mobile home and personal belongings.  The mobile home was a one-bedroom unit with an attached porch and canopy and a detached shed.  The Fredettes explained to Lindburg that they wanted to move the home and all of its contents and that they wanted to be fully insured.  After that meeting, the Fredettes left for North Carolina and stayed with relatives while Paul Fredette began work at the GE plant there.  They also purchased a lot for the home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-February, the Fredettes returned and signed an agreement with Lindburg committing Allied to move the mobile home and its contents at a cost of $20,520;  the Fredettes handed over a check, apparently believing that this amount represented all payments required for the move.  Allied planned to transport the household possessions itself.  It subcontracted the move of the mobile home to Transit and hired another company to move the porch and shed.  According to the contract, the move was to begin on February 16, 1991, with a guaranteed delivery date no later than February 25, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transit, in turn, hired James Bedford to move the mobile home and he inspected it on the day that the contract was signed.  The Fredettes then returned to North Carolina.  On February 21, 1991, Lindburg told them that Bedford had discovered pre-existing structural damage after he moved the home off its Pittsfield lot.  Bedford told Transit that the home was not roadworthy because it was sagging on its axles.  Transit told Bedford not to move the home and told Allied that the home would not be moved until the Fredettes furnished Transit with a broad liability release.  The Fredettes' personal belongings were placed in storage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fredettes returned to Pittsfield, photographed the home and hired their own expert, Stanley Bator, who determined that the home could be safely moved if a fourth axle were added.  The Fredettes refused to sign the broad release demanded by Transit, but on March 1, 1991, Doris Fredette signed a promissory note to Allied for up to $2,500 to cover costs of adding an axle.  A fourth axle was added, and on March 7, 1991, Bedford moved the home from Pittsfield, arriving in North Carolina on March 12.  On arrival, the Fredettes and an expert they hired found (and photographed) substantial damage to the interior and exterior of the home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bedford refused to place the mobile home on the lot until the Fredettes removed a fence and made other adjustments.  The Fredettes hired Irvin Finger, who did the required work, but Bedford still refused to move the home onto the lot, saying that the ground was too hilly and muddy to do it safely.  After consulting with Allied and Transit, Bedford left the mobile home near the lot and returned to Massachusetts.  The Fredettes hired a local company which promptly placed the home onto the lot for an additional fee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A week later, after a number of requests by the Fredettes, Allied sent a crew to block and level the home.  The contents of the home and the porch, including the front steps, had not yet arrived.  Apparently Allied and the Fredettes were engaged in a dispute about the storage fees incurred during the moving delay, and Allied refused to deliver the personal belongings until the storage fee was paid.  Delivery occurred on April 11, 1991, and the Fredettes moved into their home the next day, 45 days after the original guaranteed delivery date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the home was en route, Paul Fredette became depressed and, as a result, was terminated from his job with GE.  His anxiety and depression continued after the move and were confirmed by medical testimony at trial.  He returned to work in May of 1991, but left again in September, again because of depression.  Doris Fredette also suffered emotional distress.  Ultimately, the Fredettes brought suit in Massachusetts state court, alleging a number of claims against Allied, Transit and Mullen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants removed the suit to federal district court, and ultimately the parties went to trial on four counts:  count I alleged a violation of the Carmack Amendment, 49 U.S.C. Sec. 11707;  count II charged breach of contract;  count IV alleged a violation of Massachusetts consumer protection law, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A, based on the intentional infliction of emotional distress;  and count V charged intentional infliction of emotional distress.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counts I, II and V were tried to a jury beginning April 11, 1994;  Count IV, the 93A claim, was heard by the court afterward.  After the Fredettes rested, the district court dismissed Mullen as a party.  On April 14, 1994, the jury found for the Fredettes and against Allied on the breach of contract claim and the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.  It found for the Fredettes and against Transit on the Carmack Amendment claim and the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.  The jury awarded $36,000, representing $18,500 on the Carmack Amendment claim against Transit;  $7,500 on the contract claim against Allied;  and $5,000 each against these defendants on the emotional distress claim.  The district court then found in favor of Allied and Transit on the Fredettes' 93A claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allied and Transit duly filed post-trial motions, generally preserving the claims now made on appeal, but motions were denied.  Allied and Transit now appeal from the judgments against them.  The Fredettes cross appeal from the rejection of their claim against Mullen and the district court's denial of their 93A claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Carmack Amendment Claim.   The Carmack Amendment, 49 U.S.C. Sec. 11707, incorporates common law principles of liability and makes a common carrier liable for \"the actual loss or injury to the property\" that it transports interstate.  Id. Sec. 11707(a)(1).  Transit was responsible for the move of the mobile home, and the jury awarded the Fredettes $18,500 against Transit for damages to the home.  Transit argues that the Fredettes failed to present sufficient evidence of the damages to take the case to the jury;  alternatively it seeks remittitur or, in the alternative, a new trial on the issue of damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff suing under the Carmack Amendment may recover as damages only the \"actual loss or injury to the property,\" ordinarily measured either by the reduction in market value caused by the defendant or by replacement or repair costs occasioned by the harm.  See, e.g., Oak Hall Cap &amp; Gown Co., Inc. v. Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., 899 F.2d 291, 296 (4th Cir.1990).  There is no recovery under the statute for punitive damages or for damages unrelated to the property at issue.  Cleveland v. Beltman North Amer.  Co., Inc., 30 F.3d 373, 379 (2d Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 901, 130 L.Ed.2d 785 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence as to the nature and extent of physical damages sustained by the home move was presented primarily by Doris and Paul Fredette and by Irvin Finger;  Finger was a contractor who had examined the home at the Fredettes' request when it arrived in North Carolina and compared it to photographs of the home taken on the Pittsfield lot immediately prior to the move.  Finger supplied a written list of repair tasks and a proposed price of $10,500.  \"Before and after\" photographs of the home were also admitted into evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Transit argues that little beyond normal wear and tear was demonstrated, the jury was entitled to find otherwise.  The Fredettes described the condition of the home before the move and after, testifying to the broken window and door casing, missing shingles, soiled rugs, damage to aluminum siding and to the roof, a broken sink, and similar injuries discovered when the move was over.  Another witness confirmed the existence of damage to the roof and an exterior wall.  The jury was also entitled to consider the photographs.  Thus, there was ample proof of injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is of more concern is the amount of damages awarded by the jury for injury to the mobile home.  Even assuming that the jury fully accepted Finger's estimate, the award of $18,500 against Transit--or $8,350 in excess of the damages estimated by him--is puzzling.  Possibly, as Transit speculates, the jury included other damages for which Transit was not liable (e.g., damage to the porch and shed which were moved by another company), although the figures do not quite mesh.  But Transit has not claimed that the jury was misinstructed, so we have to assume that the jury intended the award to cover the mobile home itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That presents the question whether the jury was entitled to take the descriptions and photographs of the injuries to the mobile home and then value those injuries more highly than the amount assigned by the Fredettes' own witness.  Under the case law, the jury can depart upward, as well as downward, from the opinion of the expert;  and this makes good sense wherever the jury could reasonably have valued the damage without any expert opinion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The jury could do so for a broken window or dented fender;  a defective dynamo would probably be beyond its ken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The injuries to the mobile home are in between but much closer to the broken window.  The injuries here (e.g., soiled rugs, repainting, damaged sidings and roof, broken door frame) were not especially exotic in character and nothing prevented the jurors from using their own experience and common sense to adjust upward or downward the expert's own estimate.  The award was certainly very generous, in light of Finger's testimony, and a remittitur could have been ordered;  but it is hard to say that it was irrational or that the refusal to grant a new trial or remittitur on damages was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Contract Claim.   The Fredettes also won a judgment of $7,500 against Allied for breach of contract based on Allied's failure to deliver their home and goods by the guaranteed delivery date.  Allied contends that the delay resulted from events outside its control and sought an instruction on frustration of purpose.  The district court declined to give such an instruction on the ground that the evidence did not support it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party is entitled to have its legal theories presented to the jury, if legally correct and supported by the evidence.  Sullivan v. National Football League, 34 F.3d 1091, 1106-07 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1252, 131 L.Ed.2d 133 (1995).  The determination of whether there was evidence sufficient to require an instruction is made by the district court in the first instance, but is subject to appropriate appellate review.  Id. at 1107-09.   Assuming arguendo that frustration of purpose is to be determined by the jury in a proper case, see generally E. Farnsworth, Contracts Sec. 9.7, at 722 (2d ed. 1990), no reasonable jury could have concluded here that the contract's purpose had been frustrated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine of frustration of purpose, recognized in Massachusetts as elsewhere, excuses a party from contractual obligations under certain defined circumstances.  The central condition, but not the only one, is that--although \"[p]erformance remains possible\"--\"the expected value of performance to the party seeking to be excused has been destroyed by [the] fortuitous event....\" Chase Precast Corp. v. Paonessa Co., 409 Mass. 371, 566 N.E.2d 603, 608 (1991), quoting Lloyd v. Murphy, 25 Cal.2d 48, 153 P.2d 47, 50 (1944).  If the GE plant in North Carolina had burned down, the Fredettes might have argued (not necessarily with success) that the purpose of the agreement had been frustrated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, the purpose of the Fredettes' contract with Allied--to arrange for a move of home and possessions to North Carolina--was not frustrated by need for a fourth axle.  Allied might have sought an instruction on impossibility or impracticability of performance, or even on mutual mistake relating to the immediate fitness of the mobile home for transportation.  Compare Farnsworth, supra, Secs. 9.3, 9.5, 9.6.  Whether any of these sister doctrines could properly have been invoked is open to dispute;  but the dispute need not be resolved because no such instructions were sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.   Both Allied and Transit argue that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury about the elements of the emotional distress claim.  The trial judge described the elements of intentional infliction of emotional distress as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>First, that the defendants intended to cause, or should have known that its [sic] conduct would cause emotional distress;  and, Second, that the defendants' conduct was extreme and outrageous;  and, Third, that the actions of the defendants caused plaintiffs distress;  and, Fourth, that the plaintiffs suffered emotional distress.  In determining whether a defendants' [sic] conduct was extreme and utterly outrageous, you must ask yourselves whether the conduct was beyond all bounds of decency and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.  Liability can't be founded on mere insults, threats, or annoyances.  It should be noted that physical harm to the plaintiffs in [sic] not a required element of this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's instructions are taken almost verbatim from a recent decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Sena v. Commonwealth, 417 Mass. 250, 629 N.E.2d 986, 994 (1994).  In this case, the defendants submitted proposed instructions that would have required, on the fourth element, that the plaintiffs' emotional distress be \"severe\" and \"of a nature that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.\"   That language is taken from that court's watershed decision on the tort nearly twenty years ago, Agis v. Howard Johnson Co., 371 Mass. 140, 355 N.E.2d 315, 319 (1976) (quotations omitted).  The district court declined to include the \"reasonable person\" language, and an objection to this omission was preserved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Agis, the SJC has all but ignored the \"reasonable person\" language.  Every time that the court has decided an intentional infliction claim since Agis, it has omitted the \"reasonable person\" language and simply required the plaintiff to show \"severe\" emotional distress.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  This is so even in cases where the severity of the plaintiff's emotional distress is at issue.  See, e.g., Haddad v. Gonzalez, 410 Mass. 855, 576 N.E.2d 658, 667-68 (1991).  Because the district court defined the tort precisely as the state's highest court has done for more than a decade, we find no error, much less prejudicial error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Allied and Transit also contend that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law or a new trial on this claim.  The former remedy requires that \"no reasonable jury could have returned a verdict adverse to the moving party.\"  Havinga v. Crowley Towing &amp; Trans.  Co., Inc., 24 F.3d 1480, 1483 (1st Cir.1994), and we review de novo the district court's decision on such a motion.  Id.  As for a new trial, this may be granted if the district court finds that the jury's verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence;  a refusal to grant a new trial is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.  Phav v. Trueblood, Inc., 915 F.2d 764, 766 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allied and Transit argue that their conduct, even if wrongful, was not bad enough to be deemed extreme and outrageous.  In part, this argument rests on an effort to disassociate themselves from Bedford, who refused to place the home on the lot even after the Fredettes had made the initial adjustment Bedford demanded.  But the Fredettes presented evidence that Transit had ratified Bedford's demands that the North Carolina lot be levelled further, and that Transit and Allied had approved Bedford's decision to leave the site with the home still not in place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was other conduct of which the jury might have disapproved.  Transit took the lead in seeking to obtain a release from the Fredettes that seemingly went well beyond the danger that occasioned the demand.  Allied waited a week before sending a crew to block and level the site once the home was moved to North Carolina, and it waited three weeks more to deliver the Fredettes' belongings (including their car, furniture and the steps to their home) until the Fredettes paid the disputed storage charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the Massachusetts cases cited to us by defendants are distinguishable, but Transit has a plausible argument that the conduct here is not much worse than that held insufficient in Foley v. Polaroid Corp., 400 Mass. 82, 508 N.E.2d 72 (1987);  there, an employee acquitted of assault was sidetracked in his job and ostracized by other employees.  Still, in Foley the SJC thought that the company's formal actions were consistent with \"a good faith effort to maintain Foley's employment in a manner consistent with Polaroid's legitimate business concerns,\" id., 508 N.E.2d at 82;  and the court apparently equated the harassment with \"mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities\" for which recovery is not permitted under this claim.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we think that the jury was entitled, although hardly compelled, to find bad faith;  and the delays and withholding of property and services go somewhat beyond the verbal and other minor abuses that Polaroid employees directed against Foley.  Further, given the interplay between Allied, Transit and Bedford, the jury was entitled to view the conduct as a whole and not as isolated minor wrongs.  So viewed, we think that the deference to be accorded to the jury's judgment on issues of this kind keeps the verdict just this side of the dividing line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The Fredettes' 93A Claim.   The Fredettes also claimed against the defendants for violation of Massachusetts' far-reaching consumer protection law, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A.  That law proscribes \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce\" and provides a private right of action for aggrieved individuals.  The 93A claim was tried to the district court after the jury verdict on the other counts.  The court found that no violation had occurred, and ruled in favor of the defendants.  The Fredettes argue that this ruling was error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although 93A is phrased in terms different than the emotional distress tort, the analogy is closer than language might suggest.  The \"unfair or deceptive\" label sounds like a very low threshold, but the Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that 93A requires conduct that is immoral, unethical or unscrupulous or at least attains \"a level of rascality\" that goes well beyond ordinary tough business practice.  Industrial Gen. Corp. v. Sequoia Pacific Sys. Corp., 44 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir.1995) (citing numerous Massachusetts cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, in deciding the 93A claim as the finder of fact, the district judge was entitled to reach a judgment independent of the jury on such issues as the existence and extent of deception, unfairness and bad faith.  Whether or not the judge's findings can be squared with the jury's does not matter, so long as the former's findings are not clearly erroneous and the latter's are within the bounds of reason.  Wallace Motor Sales, Inc. v. American Motors Sales Corp., 780 F.2d 1049, 1063-64 (1st Cir.1985).  Precisely because this is a borderline case, we think that the respective standards of review protect both factfinders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fredettes also rely on a regulation issued by the Massachusetts Attorney General which provides that \"[i]t is an unfair and deceptive act or practice:  (a) To advertise or promise prompt delivery where delivery is neither prompt nor expeditious.\"  940 C.M.R. 3.15.  But we read this to refer to a pattern of conduct, or at least to an individual occasion in which the promisor knows that it is making untrue representations.  Whatever other criticisms may be made of Allied, nothing suggests that its original delivery date was a representation made in bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fredettes' other theory is that the defendants behaved unfairly and deceptively by specifying a price that the Fredettes believed to be all-inclusive and then imposing a succession of additional charges and demands (e.g., the storage fees, expenses relating to the new lot).  But the district judge as the trier of fact was entitled to take a more benign view and regard these extra demands as not clearly beyond what was agreed to or as occasioned by developments that no one had foreseen.  This view, although not compelled, was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5.  The Dismissal of Mullen.   At the close of their brief as appellants, the Fredettes argue that Mullen should not have been dismissed as a defendant at the close of the evidence.  Lindburg, they say, acted as the agent for both Mullen and Allied;  and Mullen is responsible, they argue, for the wrongs they attribute to Lindburg.  These wrongs they identify as (1) misadvising the Fredettes that their move was \"fully covered\" and \"fully insured\" and (2) mishandling the original inspection and measurements of the home and thereby causing a significant portion of the delay in the move.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not clear why this claimed error matters to the Fredettes since Allied and Transit are presumably solvent, and the Fredettes cannot collect twice for the same wrongs.  But in any event we see little indication that Lindburg was independently culpable:  there is no evidence that he told the Fredettes anything he had reason to believe to be untrue;  and the Fredettes point us to nothing in the record that would show that Lindburg knew or should have known that the mobile home would sag when removed from its supports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Count III, a state-law claim for property damage, was dismissed as preempted by the Carmack Amendment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> See, e.g., Weber v.

The plaintiffs in the district court were Paul and Doris Fredette;  the defendants were Allied Van Lines, Inc., (\"Allied\"), Mullen Brothers, Inc. of North Adams (\"Mullen Brothers\") and Transit Homes of America, Inc.  (\"Transit\").  The facts, taken in the light most favorable to the jury verdict, Borden v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562609\"><a href=\"/opinion/562609/ronald-borden-v-the-paul-revere-life-insurance-company-ronald-borden-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span>, 379 (1st Cir.1991), are as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1990, General Electric Company (\"GE\") laid off Paul Fredette, who was then working as a machinist in its Pittsfield, Massachusetts, plant.  GE offered Paul Fredette a position in its Hickory, North Carolina plant, and he accepted.  The Fredettes contacted defendant Mullen Brothers to arrange the move of their mobile home to North Carolina.  Mullen is a local Massachusetts mover licensed only for intrastate moves;  for interstate moves like the Fredettes', Mullen acts as an agent for Allied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1991, a Mullen sales representative, Chad Lindburg, came to the Fredettes' Pittsfield home to inspect and inventory their mobile home and personal belongings.  The mobile home was a one-bedroom unit with an attached porch and canopy and a detached shed.  The Fredettes explained to Lindburg that they wanted to move the home and all of its contents and that they wanted to be fully insured.  After that meeting, the Fredettes left for North Carolina and stayed with relatives while Paul Fredette began work at the GE plant there.  They also purchased a lot for the home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-February, the Fredettes returned and signed an agreement with Lindburg committing Allied to move the mobile home and its contents at a cost of $20,520;  the Fredettes handed over a check, apparently believing that this amount represented all payments required for the move.  Allied planned to transport the household possessions itself.  It subcontracted the move of the mobile home to Transit and hired another company to move the porch and shed.  According to the contract, the move was to begin on February 16, 1991, with a guaranteed delivery date no later than February 25, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transit, in turn, hired James Bedford to move the mobile home and he inspected it on the day that the contract was signed.  The Fredettes then returned to North Carolina.  On February 21, 1991, Lindburg told them that Bedford had discovered pre-existing structural damage after he moved the home off its Pittsfield lot.  Bedford told Transit that the home was not roadworthy because it was sagging on its axles.  Transit told Bedford not to move the home and told Allied that the home would not be moved until the Fredettes furnished Transit with a broad liability release.  The Fredettes' personal belongings were placed in storage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fredettes returned to Pittsfield, photographed the home and hired their own expert, Stanley Bator, who determined that the home could be safely moved if a fourth axle were added.  The Fredettes refused to sign the broad release demanded by Transit, but on March 1, 1991, Doris Fredette signed a promissory note to Allied for up to $2,500 to cover costs of adding an axle.  A fourth axle was added, and on March 7, 1991, Bedford moved the home from Pittsfield, arriving in North Carolina on March 12.  On arrival, the Fredettes and an expert they hired found (and photographed) substantial damage to the interior and exterior of the home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bedford refused to place the mobile home on the lot until the Fredettes removed a fence and made other adjustments.  The Fredettes hired Irvin Finger, who did the required work, but Bedford still refused to move the home onto the lot, saying that the ground was too hilly and muddy to do it safely.  After consulting with Allied and Transit, Bedford left the mobile home near the lot and returned to Massachusetts.  The Fredettes hired a local company which promptly placed the home onto the lot for an additional fee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A week later, after a number of requests by the Fredettes, Allied sent a crew to block and level the home.  The contents of the home and the porch, including the front steps, had not yet arrived.  Apparently Allied and the Fredettes were engaged in a dispute about the storage fees incurred during the moving delay, and Allied refused to deliver the personal belongings until the storage fee was paid.  Delivery occurred on April 11, 1991, and the Fredettes moved into their home the next day, 45 days after the original guaranteed delivery date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the home was en route, Paul Fredette became depressed and, as a result, was terminated from his job with GE.  His anxiety and depression continued after the move and were confirmed by medical testimony at trial.  He returned to work in May of 1991, but left again in September, again because of depression.  Doris Fredette also suffered emotional distress.  Ultimately, the Fredettes brought suit in Massachusetts state court, alleging a number of claims against Allied, Transit and Mullen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants removed the suit to federal district court, and ultimately the parties went to trial on four counts:  count I alleged a violation of the Carmack Amendment, 49 U.S.C. Sec. 11707;  count II charged breach of contract;  count IV alleged a violation of Massachusetts consumer protection law, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A, based on the intentional infliction of emotional distress;  and count V charged intentional infliction of emotional distress.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counts I, II and V were tried to a jury beginning April 11, 1994;  Count IV, the 93A claim, was heard by the court afterward.  After the Fredettes rested, the district court dismissed Mullen as a party.  On April 14, 1994, the jury found for the Fredettes and against Allied on the breach of contract claim and the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.  It found for the Fredettes and against Transit on the Carmack Amendment claim and the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.  The jury awarded $36,000, representing $18,500 on the Carmack Amendment claim against Transit;  $7,500 on the contract claim against Allied;  and $5,000 each against these defendants on the emotional distress claim.  The district court then found in favor of Allied and Transit on the Fredettes' 93A claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allied and Transit duly filed post-trial motions, generally preserving the claims now made on appeal, but motions were denied.  Allied and Transit now appeal from the judgments against them.  The Fredettes cross appeal from the rejection of their claim against Mullen and the district court's denial of their 93A claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Carmack Amendment Claim.   The Carmack Amendment, 49 U.S.C. Sec. 11707, incorporates common law principles of liability and makes a common carrier liable for \"the actual loss or injury to the property\" that it transports interstate.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562609\"><a href=\"/opinion/562609/ronald-borden-v-the-paul-revere-life-insurance-company-ronald-borden-v/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Sec. 11707(a)(1). </a></span> Transit was responsible for the move of the mobile home, and the jury awarded the Fredettes $18,500 against Transit for damages to the home.  Transit argues that the Fredettes failed to present sufficient evidence of the damages to take the case to the jury;  alternatively it seeks remittitur or, in the alternative, a new trial on the issue of damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff suing under the Carmack Amendment may recover as damages only the \"actual loss or injury to the property,\" ordinarily measured either by the reduction in market value caused by the defendant or by replacement or repair costs occasioned by the harm.  See, e.g., Oak Hall Cap &amp; Gown Co., Inc. v. Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538817\"><a href=\"/opinion/538817/oak-hall-cap-and-gown-company-incorporated-v-old-dominion-freight-line/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span>, 296 (4th Cir.1990).

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">785</span> </span>(1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence as to the nature and extent of physical damages sustained by the home move was presented primarily by Doris and Paul Fredette and by Irvin Finger;  Finger was a contractor who had examined the home at the Fredettes' request when it arrived in North Carolina and compared it to photographs of the home taken on the Pittsfield lot immediately prior to the move.  Finger supplied a written list of repair tasks and a proposed price of $10,500.  \"Before and after\" photographs of the home were also admitted into evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Transit argues that little beyond normal wear and tear was demonstrated, the jury was entitled to find otherwise.  The Fredettes described the condition of the home before the move and after, testifying to the broken window and door casing, missing shingles, soiled rugs, damage to aluminum siding and to the roof, a broken sink, and similar injuries discovered when the move was over.  Another witness confirmed the existence of damage to the roof and an exterior wall.  The jury was also entitled to consider the photographs.  Thus, there was ample proof of injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is of more concern is the amount of damages awarded by the jury for injury to the mobile home.  Even assuming that the jury fully accepted Finger's estimate, the award of $18,500 against Transit--or $8,350 in excess of the damages estimated by him--is puzzling.  Possibly, as Transit speculates, the jury included other damages for which Transit was not liable (e.g., damage to the porch and shed which were moved by another company), although the figures do not quite mesh.  But Transit has not claimed that the jury was misinstructed, so we have to assume that the jury intended the award to cover the mobile home itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That presents the question whether the jury was entitled to take the descriptions and photographs of the injuries to the mobile home and then value those injuries more highly than the amount assigned by the Fredettes' own witness.  Under the case law, the jury can depart upward, as well as downward, from the opinion of the expert;  and this makes good sense wherever the jury could reasonably have valued the damage without any expert opinion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The jury could do so for a broken window or dented fender;  a defective dynamo would probably be beyond its ken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The injuries to the mobile home are in between but much closer to the broken window.  The injuries here (e.g., soiled rugs, repainting, damaged sidings and roof, broken door frame) were not especially exotic in character and nothing prevented the jurors from using their own experience and common sense to adjust upward or downward the expert's own estimate.  The award was certainly very generous, in light of Finger's testimony, and a remittitur could have been ordered;  but it is hard to say that it was irrational or that the refusal to grant a new trial or remittitur on damages was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Contract Claim.   The Fredettes also won a judgment of $7,500 against Allied for breach of contract based on Allied's failure to deliver their home and goods by the guaranteed delivery date.  Allied contends that the delay resulted from events outside its control and sought an instruction on frustration of purpose.  The district court declined to give such an instruction on the ground that the evidence did not support it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party is entitled to have its legal theories presented to the jury, if legally correct and supported by the evidence.

Allied might have sought an instruction on impossibility or impracticability of performance, or even on mutual mistake relating to the immediate fitness of the mobile home for transportation.  Compare Farnsworth, supra, Secs. 9.3, 9.5, 9.6.  Whether any of these sister doctrines could properly have been invoked is open to dispute;  but the dispute need not be resolved because no such instructions were sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.   Both Allied and Transit argue that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury about the elements of the emotional distress claim.  The trial judge described the elements of intentional infliction of emotional distress as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>First, that the defendants intended to cause, or should have known that its [sic] conduct would cause emotional distress;  and, Second, that the defendants' conduct was extreme and outrageous;  and, Third, that the actions of the defendants caused plaintiffs distress;  and, Fourth, that the plaintiffs suffered emotional distress.  In determining whether a defendants' [sic] conduct was extreme and utterly outrageous, you must ask yourselves whether the conduct was beyond all bounds of decency and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.  Liability can't be founded on mere insults, threats, or annoyances.  It should be noted that physical harm to the plaintiffs in [sic] not a required element of this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's instructions are taken almost verbatim from a recent decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Sena v.

In this case, the defendants submitted proposed instructions that would have required, on the fourth element, that the plaintiffs' emotional distress be \"severe\" and \"of a nature that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.\"   That language is taken from that court's watershed decision on the tort nearly twenty years ago, Agis v. Howard Johnson Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2078606\"><a href=\"/opinion/2078606/agis-v-howard-johnson-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2078606\"><a href=\"/opinion/2078606/agis-v-howard-johnson-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 319 (1976) (quotations omitted).  The district court declined to include the \"reasonable person\" language, and an objection to this omission was preserved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Agis, the SJC has all but ignored the \"reasonable person\" language.  Every time that the court has decided an intentional infliction claim since Agis, it has omitted the \"reasonable person\" language and simply required the plaintiff to show \"severe\" emotional distress.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  This is so even in cases where the severity of the plaintiff's emotional distress is at issue.  See, e.g., Haddad v. Gonzalez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2013415\"><a href=\"/opinion/2013415/haddad-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">855</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2013415\"><a href=\"/opinion/2013415/haddad-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">576</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span>, 667-68 (1991).  Because the district court defined the tort precisely as the state's highest court has done for more than a decade, we find no error, much less prejudicial error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Allied and Transit also contend that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law or a new trial on this claim.  The former remedy requires that \"no reasonable jury could have returned a verdict adverse to the moving party.\"  Havinga v. Crowley Towing &amp; Trans.

Phav v. Trueblood, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548929\"><a href=\"/opinion/548929/chat-phav-v-trueblood-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span>, 766 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allied and Transit argue that their conduct, even if wrongful, was not bad enough to be deemed extreme and outrageous.  In part, this argument rests on an effort to disassociate themselves from Bedford, who refused to place the home on the lot even after the Fredettes had made the initial adjustment Bedford demanded.  But the Fredettes presented evidence that Transit had ratified Bedford's demands that the North Carolina lot be levelled further, and that Transit and Allied had approved Bedford's decision to leave the site with the home still not in place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was other conduct of which the jury might have disapproved.  Transit took the lead in seeking to obtain a release from the Fredettes that seemingly went well beyond the danger that occasioned the demand.  Allied waited a week before sending a crew to block and level the site once the home was moved to North Carolina, and it waited three weeks more to deliver the Fredettes' belongings (including their car, furniture and the steps to their home) until the Fredettes paid the disputed storage charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the Massachusetts cases cited to us by defendants are distinguishable, but Transit has a plausible argument that the conduct here is not much worse than that held insufficient in Foley v. Polaroid Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2122368\"><a href=\"/opinion/2122368/foley-v-polaroid-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2122368\"><a href=\"/opinion/2122368/foley-v-polaroid-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span> </a></span>(1987);  there, an employee acquitted of assault was sidetracked in his job and ostracized by other employees.  Still, in Foley the SJC thought that the company's formal actions were consistent with \"a good faith effort to maintain Foley's employment in a manner consistent with Polaroid's legitimate business concerns,\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2122368\"><a href=\"/opinion/2122368/foley-v-polaroid-corp/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> 508 N.E.2d </a></span>at 82;  and the court apparently equated the harassment with \"mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities\" for which recovery is not permitted under this claim.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we think that the jury was entitled, although hardly compelled, to find bad faith;  and the delays and withholding of property and services go somewhat beyond the verbal and other minor abuses that Polaroid employees directed against Foley.  Further, given the interplay between Allied, Transit and Bedford, the jury was entitled to view the conduct as a whole and not as isolated minor wrongs.  So viewed, we think that the deference to be accorded to the jury's judgment on issues of this kind keeps the verdict just this side of the dividing line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The Fredettes' 93A Claim.   The Fredettes also claimed against the defendants for violation of Massachusetts' far-reaching consumer protection law, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A.  That law proscribes \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce\" and provides a private right of action for aggrieved individuals.  The 93A claim was tried to the district court after the jury verdict on the other counts.  The court found that no violation had occurred, and ruled in favor of the defendants.  The Fredettes argue that this ruling was error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although 93A is phrased in terms different than the emotional distress tort, the analogy is closer than language might suggest.  The \"unfair or deceptive\" label sounds like a very low threshold, but the Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that 93A requires conduct that is immoral, unethical or unscrupulous or at least attains \"a level of rascality\" that goes well beyond ordinary tough business practice.  Industrial Gen. Corp. v. Sequoia Pacific Sys. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195833\"><a href=\"/opinion/195833/industrial-v-sequoia/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.1995) (citing numerous Massachusetts cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, in deciding the 93A claim as the finder of fact, the district judge was entitled to reach a judgment independent of the jury on such issues as the existence and extent of deception, unfairness and bad faith.  Whether or not the judge's findings can be squared with the jury's does not matter, so long as the former's findings are not clearly erroneous and the latter's are within the bounds of reason.  Wallace Motor Sales, Inc. v. American Motors Sales Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"463159\"><a href=\"/opinion/463159/wallace-motor-sales-inc-ralph-e-wallace-and-third-party-v-american/\"><span class=\"volume\">780</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1049</span></a></span>, 1063-64 (1st Cir.1985).  Precisely because this is a borderline case, we think that the respective standards of review protect both factfinders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fredettes also rely on a regulation issued by the Massachusetts Attorney General which provides that \"[i]t is an unfair and deceptive act or practice:  (a) To advertise or promise prompt delivery where delivery is neither prompt nor expeditious.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">C.M.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></span>.15.  But we read this to refer to a pattern of conduct, or at least to an individual occasion in which the promisor knows that it is making untrue representations.  Whatever other criticisms may be made of Allied, nothing suggests that its original delivery date was a representation made in bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fredettes' other theory is that the defendants behaved unfairly and deceptively by specifying a price that the Fredettes believed to be all-inclusive and then imposing a succession of additional charges and demands (e.g., the storage fees, expenses relating to the new lot).  But the district judge as the trier of fact was entitled to take a more benign view and regard these extra demands as not clearly beyond what was agreed to or as occasioned by developments that no one had foreseen.  This view, although not compelled, was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5.  The Dismissal of Mullen.   At the close of their brief as appellants, the Fredettes argue that Mullen should not have been dismissed as a defendant at the close of the evidence.  Lindburg, they say, acted as the agent for both Mullen and Allied;  and Mullen is responsible, they argue, for the wrongs they attribute to Lindburg.  These wrongs they identify as (1) misadvising the Fredettes that their move was \"fully covered\" and \"fully insured\" and (2) mishandling the original inspection and measurements of the home and thereby causing a significant portion of the delay in the move.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not clear why this claimed error matters to the Fredettes since Allied and Transit are presumably solvent, and the Fredettes cannot collect twice for the same wrongs.  But in any event we see little indication that Lindburg was independently culpable:  there is no evidence that he told the Fredettes anything he had reason to believe to be untrue;  and the Fredettes point us to nothing in the record that would show that Lindburg knew or should have known that the mobile home would sag when removed from its supports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Count III, a state-law claim for property damage, was dismissed as preempted by the Carmack Amendment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> See, e.g., Weber v.
