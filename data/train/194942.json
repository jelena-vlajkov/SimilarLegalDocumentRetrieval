John  Pappalardo, United States  Attorney, and Jonathan  Chiel,\n                                                                 \nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n     Per Curiam.   Defendant Efriam Natanel  appeals from the\n               \n\ngrant  of a  motion under Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 36  to correct a\n\nclerical mistake in the judgment.  The district court amended\n\nthe judgment  to include  a  four-year period  of  supervised\n\nrelease that, according to the government, had been  verbally\n\nimposed by  the sentencing  judge  but inadvertently  omitted\n\nfrom the written judgment.  Defendant argues that it was not,\n\nin fact, the judge's intention to impose such a sanction.  He\n\nalso contends that various procedural irregularities rendered\n\nthe  court's action here otherwise improper.  We find each of\n\nthese arguments without merit and therefore affirm.\n\n     On  June 1, 1989, defendant  was convicted by  a jury of\n\ndistributing more  than  500  grams  of  cocaine  to  another\n\nindividual,  in   violation  of   21  U.S.C.       841(a)(1),\n\n841(b)(1)(B)(ii)(II).  See United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n302 (1st Cir. 1991) (affirming conviction on direct  appeal),\n\ncert. denied, 112 S.  Ct. 986 (1992).1  The  offense occurred\n            \n\nin  May 1987.   At  sentencing on  September 15,  1989, Judge\n\nMcNaught imposed  a six-year prison  term, a $20,000  fine, a\n\n$50 special assessment,  and a four-year  term of  supervised\n\nrelease.   Yet the  written judgment, dated  October 2, 1989,\n\ncontained no  reference to the period  of supervised release.\n\nIn November 1992, the government filed the instant motion  to\n\ncorrect the judgment.   Judge McNaught having  retired in the\n\ninterim, another district court judge received  and summarily\n\ngranted the  motion  without  calling  for  a  response  from\n\n                    \n\n1.  Our reference there to  the conviction having occurred in\n1990, see 938 F.2d at 308-09, is in error.\n         \n\ndefendant; the judgment  was accordingly  amended to  reflect\n\nthe  term  of supervised  release.    Defendant submitted  an\n\nopposition, which arrived after the court's order, and then a\n\nmotion for reconsideration, which was summarily denied.  This\n\nappeal followed.  \n\n                              I.\n\n     It is clear  that Judge McNaught intended to impose, and\n\ndid  impose, a  term  of supervised  release at  sentencing--\n\ndespite  an  initial  pronouncement  to the  contrary.    The\n\nconfusion  appears  to have  stemmed from  the fact  that the\n\ngovernment, when  first recommending  a  sentence, failed  to\n\nmention this  sanction.2  See  Sent. Tr.  at 2.   The  court,\n                             \n\nstating that  it would \"not go beyond  the recommendations of\n\nthe prosecutor,\" therefore announced  that \"there will not be\n\na period of supervised release.\"  Id. at 18.   The government\n                                     \n\nimmediately   revised  its  recommendation  and  argued  that\n\nsupervised   release  was   mandatory   under  21   U.S.C.   \n\n841(b)(1)(B).  The court, acknowledging a lack of familiarity\n\nwith such  requirement, eventually  accepted this view  after\n\nconsulting the  statute and  explicitly included  a four-year\n\n                    \n\n2.  We note  that defendant's  attorney did recognize  that a\nperiod of  supervised release would be  \"appropriate.\"  Sent.\nTr. at 6.\n\n                             -3-\n\nterm  of  supervised  release  in   the  sentence  thereafter\n\nimposed.3\n\n     We likewise think it clear that the lack of reference to\n\nsupervised  release  in  the  written  judgment  was  due  to\n\nclerical  error.   Defendant  contends that,  far from  being\n\ninadvertent, this  change reflected a purposeful  decision on\n\nthe  court's  part--i.e.,  that   the  court  decided,  after\n\nreexamining the issue during the  intervening seventeen days,\n\nto return to its  initial inclination that supervised release\n\nwas unwarranted.   Yet the  court provided  no indication  of\n\nhaving done  any such thing.  It would be unusual, to say the\n\nleast, for a court  to revise a sentence sua  sponte, without\n                                                    \n\nnotice  or  explanation.   Moreover,  defendant's two-pronged\n\nattempt to buttress his speculation in this regard is wide of\n\nthe mark.  \n\n     First,  defendant notes that  Judge McNaught  imposed no\n\nterm   of  supervised   release   when  later   sentencing  a\n\ncodefendant  named Shlomo Levy.  This fact, however, is of no\n\nrelevance.    Unlike  defendant,   Levy  was  sentenced   for\n\n                    \n\n3.  Judge McNaught orally pronounced sentence as follows: \n\n     Efriam Natanel,  as to  Count 18 of  the indictment\n     ..., the court hereby orders that you be imprisoned\n     for a period of six years, plus a four-year  period\n     of  supervised  release   upon  your  release  from\n     incarceration.  The court further imposes a fine in\n     the amount of $20,000  plus a special assessment of\n     $50.\n\nSent. Tr. at 20.\n\n                             -4-\n\nconspiring  in 1985 to commit a drug offense, in violation of\n          \n\n21 U.S.C.   846.   And it has been clear  since 1980 that the\n\napplicable version of    846 did not contemplate any  type of\n\npost-confinement  monitoring  (either  supervised release  or\n\nspecial parole).   See, e.g.,  Bifulco v. United  States, 447\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 381 (1980).4 \n\n     Second, defendant points to the muddled state of the law\n\nin September 1989 to infer that Judge McNaught likely changed\n\nhis mind.  He concedes that subsequent caselaw has vindicated\n\nthe  government's  position   that  supervised  release   was\n\nmandatory.5   See, e.g., Gozlon-Peretz v.  United States, 498\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 395 (1991); United  States v. Morris, 977 F.2d  677, 686\n                                         \n\n(1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1588 (1993); United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.  Ocasio Figueroa,  898 F.2d  825, 827-28  (1st Cir.\n                          \n\n1990),  cert. denied, 113 S.  Ct. 1001 (1993).   He suggests,\n                    \n\nhowever,  that the prevailing view  at the time of sentencing\n\nwas to  the contrary--and that Judge  McNaught likely revised\n\nthe judgment to comport  with that view.   We agree that  the\n\nvarious amendments to 21  U.S.C.   841(b) were not a model of\n\nclarity.   In  particular,  we agree  that,  at the  time  of\n\n                    \n\n4.  In  an  amendment  not  affecting  Levy's  case, Congress\nrevised    846 in November  1988 to permit  the imposition of\nsupervised release.\n\n5.  Although the propriety of  supervised release is thus not\nin dispute,  the question of whether  Judge McNaught intended\n                                                             \nto impose  such a sanction  remains relevant  to the  various\nprocedural  arguments advanced by  defendant--such as whether\nthe government properly proceeded by way of Rule 36.\n\n                             -5-\n\nsentencing, it was unsettled whether that  aspect of the 1986\n\namendments requiring the imposition of supervised release was\n\nto take effect on October 27, 1986 or November 1, 1987.  See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., United States  v. Ferryman, 897  F.2d 584, 586-88  (1st\n                                \n\nCir.) (recounting  statutory changes), cert. denied, 498 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n830 (1990).   Yet this circumstance  avails defendant little.\n\nWe explain briefly.\n\n     The indictment here charged defendant  with distributing\n\nin  excess of 500  grams of cocaine.   If the amount involved\n\nwas  less than  one  kilogram, defendant's  argument in  this\n\nregard  would fail entirely.   Prior to  the 1986 amendments,\n\nsuch an  offense was  subject to  a mandatory  special parole\n\nterm.     See   21  U.S.C.      841(b)(1)(B)   (Supp.  1985).\n             \n\nConsequently, the  choice faced by Judge  McNaught would have\n\nbeen  between  special  parole  and  supervised  release--not\n\nbetween   the   latter  sanction   and   no  post-confinement\n\nmonitoring at all.  \n\n     Yet the  evidence at trial showed, see Natanel, 938 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat 312-13, and the government at  sentencing argued, that one\n\nkilogram of  cocaine was  involved.  This  muddies the  water\n\nslightly,  for such  an offense  was not  subject to  special\n                                        \n\nparole under preexisting law.  Id.   841(b)(1)(A); see, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nUnited  States v.  Santamaria, 788  F.2d 824,  829 (1st  Cir.\n                             \n\n                             -6-\n\n1986).6    Yet  defendant's  argument  remains  unconvincing.\n\nContrary to his  suggestion, it was not the  predominant view\n\nin  September 1989  that any  such offense  occurring in  the\n\n\"hiatus  period\" was exempt from post-confinement monitoring.\n\nOnly a few  circuit courts  had addressed the  issue by  that\n\ntime  with specific reference to an  offense that fell within\n\nthe  purview  of former  subsection  (b)(1)(A)  and thus  was\n\nexempt  from  special parole.    Their  conclusions differed.\n\nCompare United  States v. Torres,  880 F.2d 113,  114-15 (9th\n                                \n\nCir.  1989) (per  curiam)  (supervised  release  applicable),\n\ncert.  denied, 493  U.S. 1060  (1990)  with United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nLevario, 877  F.2d 1483, 1487-89 (10th  Cir. 1989) (contra).7\n       \n\nThe  lower  courts in  this  circuit  were likewise  divided.\n\nCompare  United  States v.  Chica,  707  F. Supp.  84,  85-86\n                                 \n\n(D.R.I. 1989) with Hernandez Rivera v.

We are puzzled by  the government's concession, see Brief\n                                                       \nat  6 n.5, that the supervised release period here could have\nbeen invalidated between the time of our Ferryman decision in\n                                                 \nFebruary  1990 and  the Supreme  Court's decision  in Gozlon-\n                                                             \nPeretz  one  year later.   In  Ferryman,  where we  held that\n                                       \nspecial  parole  remained applicable  to the  \"hiatus period\"\noffenses, we expressly withheld any view as to those offenses\nsubject to former (b)(1)(A).   See 897 F.2d at 589 n.4.   One\n                                  \nmonth later, we ruled that such offenses in fact were subject\nto supervised release.  See Ocasio Figueroa, 898 F.2d at 827-\n                                           \n28.\n\n7.  As  noted in  United  States v.  Gozlon-Peretz, 894  F.2d\n                                                  \n1402, 1404-05 (3d Cir.  1990), aff'd, 498 U.S. 395  (1991), a\n                                    \nnumber   of  other  cases   that  found   supervised  release\ninapplicable  involved  offenses  apparently   within  former\nsubsections  (b)(1)(B)  &amp;  (C),  such  that  special   parole\nremained available.\n\n                             -7-\n\nSupp. 65, 66  (D.P.R. 1989).   This mottled milieu  obviously\n\nwould  not  have  persuaded  Judge  McNaught  to  revise  the\n\njudgment  sub  silentio.   We  conclude  that an  inadvertent\n                       \n\nomission, rather than a deliberate deletion, occurred here.\n\n                             II.\n\n     Given this conclusion,  defendant's remaining  arguments\n\ncan be readily dispatched.   It is clear that  correcting the\n\nwritten judgment was appropriate  here.  Where an unambiguous\n\noral  sentence pronounced  by  the court  conflicts with  the\n\nwritten  judgment, the  former controls.   See,  e.g., United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.

In\n                                \n\naddition,  Rule  36--not  former  Rule  35(a),  as  defendant\n\nargues--provides  the proper  vehicle for  correcting such  a\n\nclerical  error.8   See,  e.g., United  States v.  Corey,    \n                                                        \n\nF.2d    , No.  92-1223 (10th Cir.  1993) (Rule 36  correction\n\nappropriate where judgment should have imposed three,  rather\n\nthan  five, years  of supervised  release); United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nStrozier, 940 F.2d 985,  987 n.2 (6th Cir. 1991)  (same where\n        \n\njudgment omitted term of supervised release).  \n\n     It  was also  unnecessary that  defendant be  physically\n\npresent at the time  the judgment was corrected.   See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\n                    \n\n8.  Rule 36 reads: \"Clerical mistakes in judgments, orders or\nother  parts of the record  and errors in  the record arising\nfrom oversight or omission  may be corrected by the  court at\nany time and after such notice, if any, as the court enters.\"\n\n                             -8-\n\nCorey, supra, slip op. at 5 (\"court may correct the error ...\n            \n\nsua  sponte\");  see also  United  States  v.  De Los  Santos-\n                                                             \n\nHimitola, 924  F.2d 380, 382-83 (1st  Cir. 1991) (defendant's\n        \n\npresence not  required where  sentence  amended under  former\n\nRule 35(a)  to conform to  originally imposed sentence).   In\n\nfact,  the language  of  Rule 36  leaves  it to  the  court's\n\ndiscretion whether even to provide notice to the parties that\n\na clerical  error  is being  corrected.

Wright, Federal\n                                                             \n\nPractice and Procedure: Criminal 2d    722, at 16 (1982 &amp; '93\n                                   \n\nSupp.), our analysis in De Los Santos-Himitola confirms it is\n                                              \n\nnot a  compulsory practice.  Since the  corrective order here\n\ndid not  enhance defendant's sentence but  simply revised the\n\njudgment  to  reflect  the  sentence as  originally  imposed,\n\ndefendant's presence was unnecessary.9  \n\n     Nor  is relief precluded by the fact that the motion was\n\nfiled over three years after entry of judgment (and some four\n\nmonths, according  to defendant, before his scheduled release\n\nfrom prison).  Rule  36 permits the correction of  a clerical\n\nerror  \"at any time.\"  While the government has not explained\n\nits  failure  to act  earlier,  courts have  granted  Rule 36\n\nrelief after even lengthier delays.  See, e.g., United States\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n9.  United States v. Cook, 890 F.2d 672, 675 (4th Cir. 1989),\n                         \nupon which defendant relies, did not involve a clerical error\nsubject to correction under Rule 36 and is thus inapposite.\n\n                             -9-\n\nv.  Marquez, 506 F.2d 620,  621 (2d Cir.  1974) (five years).\n           \n\nDefendant  contends that relief  should nonetheless be barred\n\nbecause  the  government  purposefully delayed  acting  until\n\nafter  Judge McNaught's  retirement.   In support,  he argues\n\nthat our opinion  on direct appeal alerted  the government to\n\nthe fact that the judgment contained no mention of supervised\n\nrelease.  To the contrary, we there made no reference to  the\n\nissue.10   And  no other  evidence  of deliberate  delay  has\n\nbeen adduced.  \n\n     Finally,  defendant  argues  in  a  similar  vein   that\n\ncorrection of the judgment  at this late date so  trenches on\n\nhis settled expectations as to violate due process.  Reliance\n\nis  placed on  Breest v.  Helgemoe, 579  F.2d 95  (1st Cir.),\n                                  \n\ncert. denied, 439 U.S. 933 (1978), in which we noted that the\n            \n\npower  of a  court  to correct  a  sentence to  comport  with\n\nstatutory requirements  might  be subject  to  some  temporal\n\nlimit.11  Yet it  cannot be said that defendant here  had any\n\n                    \n\n10.  Defendant  apparently  deems  significant our  statement\nthat he  \"was subsequently sentenced  to six years  in prison\nand fined  $20,000.\"    938 F.2d  at  306.   Yet  his  appeal\ninvolved no challenge  to any  aspect of his  sentence.   The\nfact  that we did not mention his supervised release term (or\nhis $50 special assessment) is thus understandable. \n\n11.  We stated: \n\n     After a substantial period  of time,... it might be\n     fundamentally unfair,  and  thus violative  of  due\n     process,  for  a court  to  alter  even an  illegal\n     sentence  in a  way which  frustrates a  prisoner's\n     expectations by postponing  his parole  eligibility\n     or release date far beyond that originally set.\n\n                             -10-\n\nreasonable  expectation  that he  was exempt  from supervised\n\nrelease.  The fact  that Judge McNaught unambiguously imposed\n\nsuch sanction, the fact that our Ocasio Figueroa decision six\n                                                \n\nmonths  later confirmed  the propriety of  doing so,  and the\n\nfact  that  such  a  sanction  is  statutorily  mandated  all\n\nmilitate against such a  conclusion.  Moreover, the corrected\n\njudgment here did not  postpone defendant's release date, but\n\nsimply  confirmed  the  fact  that  he  would be  subject  to\n\nsupervision  following  his release.    The  Breest dicta  is\n                                                   \n\ntherefore inapposite.\n\n     Affirmed.\n              \n\n                    \n\n579 F.2d at 101.\n\n                             -11-\n",

This\n\nappeal followed.  \n\n                              I.\n\n     It is clear  that Judge McNaught intended to impose, and\n\ndid  impose, a  term  of supervised  release at  sentencing--\n\ndespite  an  initial  pronouncement  to the  contrary.    The\n\nconfusion  appears  to have  stemmed from  the fact  that the\n\ngovernment, when  first recommending  a  sentence, failed  to\n\nmention this  sanction.2  See  Sent. Tr.  at 2.   The  court,\n                             \n\nstating that  it would \"not go beyond  the recommendations of\n\nthe prosecutor,\" therefore announced  that \"there will not be\n\na period of supervised release.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564772\"><a href=\"/opinion/564772/united-states-v-efraim-natanel-aka-efriam-natanel/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 18. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  The government\n                                     \n\nimmediately   revised  its  recommendation  and  argued  that\n\nsupervised   release  was   mandatory   under  21   U.S.C.   \n\n841(b)(1)(B).  The court, acknowledging a lack of familiarity\n\nwith such  requirement, eventually  accepted this view  after\n\nconsulting the  statute and  explicitly included  a four-year\n\n                    \n\n2.  We note  that defendant's  attorney did recognize  that a\nperiod of  supervised release would be  \"appropriate.\"  Sent.\nTr. at 6.\n\n                             -3-\n\nterm  of  supervised  release  in   the  sentence  thereafter\n\nimposed.3\n\n     We likewise think it clear that the lack of reference to\n\nsupervised  release  in  the  written  judgment  was  due  to\n\nclerical  error.   Defendant  contends that,  far from  being\n\ninadvertent, this  change reflected a purposeful  decision on\n\nthe  court's  part--i.e.,  that   the  court  decided,  after\n\nreexamining the issue during the  intervening seventeen days,\n\nto return to its  initial inclination that supervised release\n\nwas unwarranted.   Yet the  court provided  no indication  of\n\nhaving done  any such thing.  It would be unusual, to say the\n\nleast, for a court  to revise a sentence sua  sponte, without\n                                                    \n\nnotice  or  explanation.   Moreover,  defendant's two-pronged\n\nattempt to buttress his speculation in this regard is wide of\n\nthe mark.  \n\n     First,  defendant notes that  Judge McNaught  imposed no\n\nterm   of  supervised   release   when  later   sentencing  a\n\ncodefendant  named Shlomo Levy.  This fact, however, is of no\n\nrelevance.    Unlike  defendant,   Levy  was  sentenced   for\n\n                    \n\n3.  Judge McNaught orally pronounced sentence as follows: \n\n     Efriam Natanel,  as to  Count 18 of  the indictment\n     ..., the court hereby orders that you be imprisoned\n     for a period of six years, plus a four-year  period\n     of  supervised  release   upon  your  release  from\n     incarceration.  The court further imposes a fine in\n     the amount of $20,000  plus a special assessment of\n     $50.\n\nSent.

And it has been clear  since 1980 that the\n\napplicable version of    846 did not contemplate any  type of\n\npost-confinement  monitoring  (either  supervised release  or\n\nspecial parole).   See, e.g.,  Bifulco v. United  States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110305\"><a href=\"/opinion/110305/bifulco-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span>\n                                                        \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1980).4 \n\n     Second, defendant points to the muddled state of the law\n\nin September 1989 to infer that Judge McNaught likely changed\n\nhis mind.

He suggests,\n                    \n\nhowever,  that the prevailing view  at the time of sentencing\n\nwas to  the contrary--and that Judge  McNaught likely revised\n\nthe judgment to comport  with that view.   We agree that  the\n\nvarious amendments to 21  U.S.C.   841(b) were not a model of\n\nclarity.   In  particular,  we agree  that,  at the  time  of\n\n                    \n\n4.  In  an  amendment  not  affecting  Levy's  case, Congress\nrevised    846 in November  1988 to permit  the imposition of\nsupervised release.\n\n5.  Although the propriety of  supervised release is thus not\nin dispute,  the question of whether  Judge McNaught intended\n                                                             \nto impose  such a sanction  remains relevant  to the  various\nprocedural  arguments advanced by  defendant--such as whether\nthe government properly proceeded by way of Rule 36.\n\n                             -5-\n\nsentencing, it was unsettled whether that  aspect of the 1986\n\namendments requiring the imposition of supervised release was\n\nto take effect on October 27, 1986 or November 1, 1987.  See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., United States  v.

Yet this circumstance  avails defendant little.\n\nWe explain briefly.\n\n     The indictment here charged defendant  with distributing\n\nin  excess of 500  grams of cocaine.   If the amount involved\n\nwas  less than  one  kilogram, defendant's  argument in  this\n\nregard  would fail entirely.   Prior to  the 1986 amendments,\n\nsuch an  offense was  subject to  a mandatory  special parole\n\nterm.     See   21  U.S.C.      841(b)(1)(B)   (Supp.  1985).\n             \n\nConsequently, the  choice faced by Judge  McNaught would have\n\nbeen  between  special  parole  and  supervised  release--not\n\nbetween   the   latter  sanction   and   no  post-confinement\n\nmonitoring at all.  \n\n     Yet the  evidence at trial showed, see </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564772\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Natanel,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/564772/united-states-v-efraim-natanel-aka-efriam-natanel/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n                                                   \n\nat <span class=\"page\">312-13</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and the government at  sentencing argued, that one\n\nkilogram of  cocaine was  involved.
