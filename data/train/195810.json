Pro se appellant  Gary Lutin, a  corporate\r                                     \n\nofficer  and sole owner  of Lutin Central  Services Co., Inc.\n\n[LCS], appeals the denial by the district court of his motion\n\nfor reconsideration,1  pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.  P. 60(b), of\n\nthe judgment granting the  motion of appellee, D.S. Atkinson,\n\nInc.,  to enforce a settlement agreement.2   Lutin claims (1)\n\nthat the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to\n\nenforce  the agreement;  (2) that  the court  lacked personal\n\njurisdiction over him; and (3) that the district court abused\n\nits  discretion in  declining to  grant his  requested relief\n\nfrom judgment.  We affirm.\n\n     The Supreme Court recently  has indicated that, when, as\n\nin  the  instant  case,  a  federal  district  court  neither\n\nembodies a settlement agreement  in its judgment of dismissal\n\nnor  retains  jurisdiction  over  it,   \"enforcement  of  the\n\nsettlement  agreement is  for state  courts, unless  there is\r                                                                         \n\nsome independent  basis for federal  jurisdiction.\"  Kokkonen\r                                                                         \n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Lutin  also purports to represent LCS.  However, a pro se\r                                                                         \nappellant cannot  represent a  corporation.  Eagle  Assoc. v.\r                                                                     \nBank  of Montreal, 926 F.2d 1305, 1308 (2d Cir. 1991) (citing\r                             \ncases).\n\n2.  Lutin  did not  file a  formal motion  but rather  sent a\nletter  to the  district court asking  the court  to \"remove,\nvacate or  reconsider the order and to suspend the judgment.\"\nLike the district court,  we treat this as a  motion pursuant\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).  On appeal, Lutin  asserts that his\nletter  also could be construed as a motion to amend judgment\npursuant  to Rule 59(e).  However, since there is no evidence\nthe  letter  was  ever  \"served\"  upon  appellee,  it  cannot\nfunction as  a Rule  59(e) motion.   Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 59(e);\nRivera v. M/T Fossarina, 840 F.2d 152, 154 (1st Cir. 1988).\r                                   \r\r\n\nv. Guardian Life Insurance  Co. of Am., 114 S.Ct.  1673, 1677\r                                                 \n\n(1994).   Since  this  is  an  action  where  the  matter  in\n\ncontroversy  is more  than  $50,000 and  between citizens  of\n\ndifferent states,  28 U.S.C.   1332  provides \"an independent\n\nbasis  for  federal  jurisdiction.\"     The  district   court\n\ntherefore  possessed  subject  matter jurisdiction  over  the\n\nmotion  to  enforce the  settlement  agreement.   See  United\r                                                                         \n\nStates v. Baus,  834 F.2d  1114, 1127 n.  13 (1st Cir.  1987)\r                          \n\n(court possessed jurisdiction  over enforcement of settlement\n\nagreement because fact  that United States  was party to  the\n\ncontract  gave  court   an  independent  basis   for  federal\n\njurisdiction).\n\n     The  claim  that  the  court did  not  possess  personal\n\njurisdiction  over Lutin  was not  clearly raised  before the\n\ndistrict court and thus  has been waived.  See  Marcial Ucin,\r                                                                         \n\nS.A., v. SS  Galicia, 723  F.2d 994, 996-97  (1st Cir.  1983)\r                                \n\n(claim  of lack of personal jurisdiction may be waived if not\n\nasserted in a timely fashion).\n\n     Finally, we find no abuse of  discretion in the district\n\ncourt's  denial of Lutin's motion to vacate the judgment. See\r                                                                         \n\nde la Torre v. Continental Ins.

Insofar as  that motion  was predicated  upon a\n\nclaim that his attorney's  failure to appear for the  April 7\n\nhearing prevented Lutin from  presenting his arguments to the\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ndistrict court, the  attorney was  aware of the  date of  the\n\nhearing  and chose  not  to attend  even  though he  had  not\n\nobtained a  continuance.   Such \"inexcusable neglect\"  by his\n\nattorney  does  not  entitle   Lutin  to  relief  under  Rule\n\n60(b)(1).  See  Link v. Wabash R.  Co., 370 U.S.  626, 633-36\r                                                 \n\n(1962);  Vargas v.

However, this  court has frequently indicated that\n\n\"Rule  60(b)(6) may not be used as a back-door substitute for\n\nan omitted  appeal,  and, in  all  but the  most  exceptional\n\ncircumstances,  a party's  neglect  to  prosecute  a  timeous\n\nappeal  will bar  relief under  the rule.\"   Cotto  v.

R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6).  However, this court has frequently indicated that \"Rule 60(b)(6) may not be used as a back-door substitute for an omitted appeal, and, in all but the most exceptional circumstances, a party's neglect to prosecute a timeous appeal will bar relief under the rule.\"  Cotto v.

We have reviewed carefully the record in this case and the briefs of the parties and find no \"exceptional circumstances\" which would entitle Lutin to relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Lutin also purports to represent LCS.

R. Civ. P. 60(b).  On appeal, Lutin asserts that his letter also could be construed as a motion to amend judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e).  However, since there is no evidence the letter was ever \"served\" upon appellee, it cannot function as a Rule 59(e) motion.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e);  Rivera v.
