Leary, a civilian employee of the Portsmouth Naval\r\n\nShipyard (\"Shipyard\") and the United States Navy, was removed\r\n\nfrom  government service for \"excessive unauthorized absence\"\r\n\nafter  he was  denied requested  leave for  the time  that he\r\n\nspent  in  jail  following   his  arrest  for  driving  while\r\n\nintoxicated.  After exhausting administrative remedies, Leary\r\n\nfiled  suit  in  the  United States  District  Court  for the\r\n\nDistrict of Maine against defendant-appellee John  H. Dalton,\r\n\nSecretary  of the Navy.  Leary's complaint alleged that he is\r\n\nan  alcoholic   and,  therefore,   an   \"individual  with   a\r\n\nhandicap\"1 within  the meaning  of the Rehabilitation  Act of\r\n\n1973,  29 U.S.C.      701-797b  (\"Act\"),  and that  the  Navy\r\n\ndiscriminated  against  him  in   violation  of  the  Act  by\r\n\nterminating his  employment on  the basis of  his disability.\r\n\nLeary appeals  the  district court's  order granting  summary\r\n\njudgment in favor of the Navy.  After carefully reviewing the\r\n\nrecord and considering Leary's arguments, we affirm.      \r\n\n                        I.  Background\r                                    I.  Background\r                                                  \r\n\n          Beginning October  1, 1984,  Leary was  employed by\r\n\nthe Navy as a  WG-10 electrician in Shop 97  at the Shipyard.\r\n\nBetween  1985  and 1989,  Leary  received  numerous incentive\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  In 1992, the Rehabilitation Act was amended to substitute\r\nthe  term  \"disability\"  for  \"handicap.\"    The  regulations\r\npromulgated under  the Act,  however, continue to  employ the\r\nterm \"handicap.\"\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nawards  and  was \"Suggestor  of  the Month\"  in  March, 1989.\r\n\nLeary became  a Union Shop Steward in March, 1988 and rose to\r\n\nthe rank of Chief Steward for his shop area in January, 1989.\r\n\nOn his  last performance appraisal, covering  the period June\r\n\n1, 1988 through May 31, 1989, he received a rating of \"highly\r\n\nsatisfactory.\"  \r\n\n          On  August  26, 1989,  while  off  duty, Leary  was\r\n\narrested  by state police  in Concord,  New Hampshire,  for a\r\n\nsecond  offense of driving  while intoxicated,  driving after\r\n\nlicense revocation, possessing marijuana, possessing cocaine,\r\n\ntransporting   a  controlled  drug,   resisting  arrest,  and\r\n\nassaulting a police  officer.  Leary was  incarcerated in New\r\n\nHampshire at the Merrimack County Jail, subject to a  $10,000\r\n\ncash bail.  Unable to  make bail, Leary remained incarcerated\r\n\nuntil September  13, 1989.  When he  failed to report to work\r\n\non August 28,  1989, without having either requested leave in\r\n\nadvance or notified his supervisor of his  absence, Leary was\r\n\nplaced on unauthorized leave  status (\"Z leave\").  As  of the\r\n\ndate  of  his arrest,  Leary had  accumulated 129.5  hours of\r\n\nearned  annual leave.   On  August  29, 1989,  Leary's sister\r\n\ncalled  Richard   Lavoie,  Temporary  Service   Shop  General\r\n\nForeman, to  request on  Leary's  behalf that  he be  granted\r\n\nearned  annual leave to cover the  period of his absence.  On\r\n\nAugust  30,  1989, Leary  himself  called  Lavoie to  request\r\n\nemergency annual  leave during  his  incarceration.   Leary's\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nrequest  was  denied and  he was  informed  that he  would be\r\n\ncarried on Z leave status  until he returned to duty.   Leary\r\n\nreturned to  the Shipyard after twelve  consecutive work days\r\n\nof unauthorized absence.   Upon his  return, he appealed  the\r\n\ndenial of his request for  emergency annual leave through the\r\n\nunion  grievance  process,  but   after  a  hearing  and  due\r\n\nconsideration  by  Shipyard  management,  the  grievance  was\r\n\ndenied.  \r\n\n          By letter  dated  October 3,  1989, Leary  received\r\n\nnotice  of  the Navy's  proposed  action to  remove  him from\r\n\ngovernment service for the  following reasons: (i) his arrest\r\n\non  August 26, 1989 on the  charges set forth supra; (ii) his\r                                                               \r\n\nfailure to report to work on August 28, 1989, and his failure\r\n\nto  request leave in advance  or to notify  his supervisor or\r\n\nshop  officials as to the  reason for his  absence; and (iii)\r\n\nhis unauthorized absence during  the period August 28 through\r\n\nSeptember  13,  1989.   On October  19,  1989, Leary  and his\r\n\nrepresentatives met with Gary Alamed, Administrative Officer,\r\n\nto  make  an oral  reply to  the  proposed action.    At this\r\n\nmeeting, and  apparently for  the first time,  Leary made  it\r\n\nknown that he had problems with alcohol and drugs and that he\r\n\nconsidered  himself  to be  protected by  the  Act.   He also\r\n\nstated that he was  seeking help for these problems  from the\r\n\nShipyard's  Employee Assistance  Program.   By  letter  dated\r\n\nDecember  4, 1989,  Leary received  notice of  the Shipyard's\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ndecision  to  remove him  from government  service, effective\r\n\nDecember 11, 1989, for excessive unauthorized  absence during\r\n\nthe period August 28, 1989, through September 13, 1989.\r\n\n          On December 21, 1989, Leary filed an appeal of  the\r\n\nNavy's  decision with  the  Merit  Systems  Protection  Board\r\n\n(\"MSPB\"), in which he alleged discrimination on the  basis of\r\n\na  disability and reprisal for  his union activity.   He also\r\n\nclaimed  disparate  treatment,  alleging  that   other,  non-\r\n\ndisabled employees had been granted leave  for incarceration.\r\n\nOn  April   9,  1990,  after  an   evidentiary  hearing,  the\r\n\nAdministrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") sustained the Navy's action.\r\n\nWith respect to Leary's claim  of discrimination on the basis\r\n\nof  a   disability,  the  ALJ  found   that,  although  Leary\r\n\nestablished  that he  was disabled  due to  alcohol and  drug\r\n\ndependency, the unauthorized absence for which he was removed\r\n\nwas  neither caused by, nor  entirely a manifestation of, his\r\n\ndisability.  Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that Leary failed\r\n\nto establish a prima  facie case of disability discrimination\r\n\nunder the  Act.   The ALJ  also concluded  that there was  no\r\n\nsupport for  Leary's claim  of disparate  treatment, finding,\r\n\ninter alia, that  the employees alleged to  have been granted\r                      \r\n\nleave for incarceration  were not similarly situated  because\r\n\nthey  were assigned  to different  shops and  supervisors, or\r\n\nbecause they were absent for fewer than five consecutive days\r\n\nand  therefore did  not run  afoul of  Navy leave  policy, or\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nbecause  the supervisor  granting  leave was  not aware  that\r\n\nleave was requested to cover jail time.\r\n\n          By  final order  dated January  10, 1992,  the MSPB\r\n\ndenied  Leary's petition  for review  before the  full Board.\r\n\nLeary  thereafter sought  review of  the final  MSPB decision\r\n\nwith  the Equal  Employment Opportunity  Commission (\"EEOC\").\r\n\nOn  August 19, 1993, the  EEOC affirmed, finding, inter alia,\r                                                                        \r\n\nthat,  although  his problems  with  alcohol  and drug  abuse\r\n\nconstituted a disability covered by the Act, Leary had failed\r\n\nto establish a sufficient causal nexus between his disability\r\n\nand his  termination to  make out a  claim of  discrimination\r\n\nbased on disability.  \r\n\n          On September  24, 1993, Leary filed  a complaint in\r\n\nthe district court alleging  discrimination under the Act and\r\n\ndisparate treatment.  On  April 28, 1994, the Navy  moved for\r\n\nsummary judgment.   The motion was  referred to a  magistrate\r\n\njudge,  who,  on September  19,  1994,  recommended that  the\r\n\nmotion  be  granted  on  the  ground  that  Leary  failed  to\r\n\nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination under the Act.\r\n\nOn  October  3,  1994,  Leary  filed  his  objection  to  the\r\n\nmagistrate  judge's Recommended  Decision.    On October  26,\r\n\n1994, the district court, having made a de novo determination\r                                                           \r\n\nof all matters adjudicated  by the magistrate judge, affirmed\r\n\nthe Recommended Decision and granted summary judgment for the\r\n\nNavy.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n                   II.

First, he\r\n\ncontends that  the  district  court  overlooked  two  genuine\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nissues  of   material  fact:    whether   his  disability  --\r\n\nalcoholism  -- \"manifested  itself  as, or  resulted in,  the\r\n\nactions which led to his consequent incarceration and absence\r\n\nfrom  work,\" and  therefore  constituted the  reason for  his\r\n\ntermination; and  whether, with  regard to his  allegation of\r\n\ndisparate treatment,  other non-disabled Navy  employees were\r\n\ngranted  leave for  their periods  of incarceration,  or were\r\n\nmerely   reprimanded  (rather  than   terminated)  for  their\r\n\nconduct.  Leary argues  in the alternative that the  district\r\n\ncourt  should  have applied  a  \"but for\"  test  to determine\r\n\nwhether he was terminated because of his alcoholism.\r\n\n          We  begin by  ironing  out  a  procedural  wrinkle.\r\n\nAlthough  the district court decided this case under   504 of\r\n\nthe  Rehabilitation   Act,  29  U.S.C.      794  (prohibiting\r\n\ndisability  discrimination  by   non-federal  recipients   of\r\n\nfederal funds), Leary actually  invoked   501 of the  Act, 29\r\n\nU.S.C.    791, in his  complaint.

Not only is it unclear whether the right of action\r\n\nunder    504 overlaps with that in   501, it is also unclear,\r\n\nin  light of  recent  amendments to  the Rehabilitation  Act,\r\n\nwhether  the  two  sections   require  the  same  showing  of\r\n\ncausation.  As amended in 1992, both sections now incorporate\r\n\nthe  liability standards  of Title  I of  the Americans  with\r\n\nDisabilities Act  of 1990 (\"ADA\"), 42  U.S.C.    12111-12117.\r\n\nSee 29 U.S.C.    791(g), 794(d).  Section 504 alone, however,\r               \r\n\ncontinues  to   require  a  showing   that  the   plaintiff's\r\n\ndisability was  the sole  reason for the  defendant's adverse\r                                    \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\naction.    See 29  U.S.C.    794(a) (\"No  otherwise qualified\r                          \r\n\nindividual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of\r                                                                         \r\n\nher or his disability, be excluded from the participation in,\r                                 \r\n\nbe denied the benefits of, or be subjected to  discrimination\r\n\nunder  any program  or activity  receiving  Federal financial\r\n\nassistance or under any program or activity conducted  by any\r\n\nExecutive agency  or by  the United States  Postal Service.\")\r\n\n(emphasis added).  The precise relationship between the ADA's\r\n\nliability standards and the  sole causation test is not  well\r\n\nsettled.    And, to  compound these  difficulties, it  is not\r\n\nobvious whether  the 1992  amendments apply to  Leary's suit,\r\n\nwhich  accrued and  was administratively  pending  before the\r\n\namendments took effect.\r\n\n          We therefore regard the  applicability of   504 and\r\n\nits sole causation test in this federal employment suit as an\r\n\nopen question; but  one that we need  not reach here.   Leary\r\n\nagrees on appeal that his claim arises  under   504, and that\r\n\nhe bears the burden  of demonstrating that he was  terminated\r\n\n\"solely by reason of\"  his disability.  More  importantly, we\r\n\nthink that the judgment for the Navy should be affirmed, even\r\n\nassuming in Leary's favor that disability discrimination need\r\n\nonly be  a reason,  as opposed  to the  sole reason,  for his\r\n\ntermination.\r\n\n          In  any claim  under  the Rehabilitation  Act,  the\r\n\nplaintiff  must first  establish that  s/he has  a disability\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\ncovered  by  the Act.   The  governing regulations  define an\r\n\n\"individual  with  a [disability]\"  as  one  who  \"(i) Has  a\r\n\nphysical or mental impairment which substantially limits  one\r\n\nor  more of such person's  major life activities;  (ii) Has a\r\n\nrecord  of such an impairment; or (iii) Is regarded as having\r\n\nsuch  an  impairment.\"   29 C.F.R.    1614.203.   It  is well\r\n\nsettled that alcoholism is a disability within the meaning of\r\n\nthe  Act.2  See, e.g.,  Cook v. Department  of Mental Health,\r                                                                         \r\n\nRetardation &amp; Hosps., 10 F.3d 17, 24 (1st Cir. 1993); Little,\r                                                                        \r\n\n1  F.3d at 257; Fuller v.

For the purposes  of this appeal,  the Navy concedes\r\n\nthat Leary  is an  alcoholic and  is therefore  an individual\r\n\nwith a disability.\r\n\n          Leary  must  also show  that  with  respect to  his\r\n\nemployment, he is a \"qualified individual with a [disability]\r\n\nwho,  with or without  reasonable accommodation,  can perform\r\n\nthe essential functions of the position in  question . . . .\"\r\n\n29 C.F.R.    1614.203(a)(6)  (implementing 29 U.S.C.    791).\r\n\nSee  also  29 U.S.C.    794  (protecting only  the \"otherwise\r                     \r\n\nqualified  individual with a disability\").  In this case, the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  We note that the  statute was amended in 1990  to exclude\r\n(for purposes of    793  and 794 as these sections  relate to\r\nemployment) from the term \"individual with a disability\" \"any\r\nindividual who is  an alcoholic whose current  use of alcohol\r\nprevents such  individual from  performing the duties  of the\r\njob in  question  or  whose  employment, by  reason  of  such\r\ncurrent alcohol  abuse, would  constitute a direct  threat to\r\nproperty or the safety of others.\"  29 U.S.C.   706(8)(C)(v).\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n\"essential function[]\"  is showing up for  work as scheduled,\r\n\nunless  leave is  authorized.   Finally, regardless  of which\r\n\nsection of the Act applies, Leary must show at a minimum that\r\n\nhis disability was a reason -- if not the sole  reason -- for\r\n\nhis discharge.\r\n\n          Leary fails  to establish either the  second or the\r\n\nthird  element of his  claim.  It  is the Navy's  policy that\r\n\nleave  will  be granted  only for  bona  fide reasons  -- for\r\n\nexample,  a  serious  accident or  illness  or  death  in the\r\n\nemployee's  immediate family,  or  other  circumstances  over\r\n\nwhich  the  employee  has no  control.    The  Navy does  not\r\n\nconsider incarceration to be a  bona fide reason for granting\r\n\nleave of  any kind.  To grant leave to employees serving time\r\n\nin jail, says the Navy, is to violate the public's confidence\r\n\nin  the Navy and its  personnel, the maintenance  of which is\r\n\none of the  \"Bedrock Standards of  Conduct for Department  of\r\n\nthe  Navy  Personnel.\"    Accordingly,  the  Human  Resources\r\n\nDepartment  of the Shipyard uniformly advises supervisors and\r\n\nemployees that it  is never appropriate  to approve leave  of\r\n\nany kind to cover the period of an employee's incarceration.\r\n\n          The Navy defines  excessive unauthorized absence as\r\n\nunauthorized  absence  for more  than  five  consecutive work\r\n\ndays.   According  to  the Navy's  \"Schedule of  Disciplinary\r\n\nOffenses and Recommended Remedies for Civilian Employees,\" an\r\n\nemployee's   excessive   unauthorized   absence   --   twelve\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nconsecutive  work  days, in  Leary's  case --  may  result in\r\n\ndisciplinary  action ranging from  reprimand to removal, even\r\n\nfor a first offense.  It appears, then, that Leary was placed\r\n\non unauthorized leave status, denied leave for incarceration,\r\n\nand  discharged for  excessive unauthorized  absence,  all in\r\n\naccordance with established Navy policies.\r\n\n          Even  assuming that  Leary's  incarceration  was  a\r\n\n\"manifestation\" of his alcoholism, cf.  Teahan v. Metro-North\r                                                                         \r\n\nCommuter R.

Ct. 54 (1992),  we reject\r                                      \r\n\nthe argument that Leary should have been allowed to draw upon\r\n\nhis accrued annual leave  as a \"reasonable accommodation\" for\r\n\nhis disability.   First,  Leary does  not dispute  the Navy's\r\n\ncontention that he neither advised the Navy of his alcoholism\r\n\nnor sought accommodation  of any kind until after he returned\r\n\nto  duty following his incarceration.   So far  as the record\r\n\nshows,  the Navy  denied Leary's  initial requests  for leave\r\n\nwithout knowing the nature  of the incident that  resulted in\r\n\nhis incarceration.  We have  said, in the context of a    504\r\n\nsuit, that an institution \"can be expected to respond only to\r\n\nwhat it knows  (or is  chargeable with knowing).\"   Wynne  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nTufts Univ.

As we\r\n\nhave  observed,  government entities  have  the discretionary\r\n\nauthority  to determine  what policies  are necessary  to the\r\n\nexecution  of their  assigned  missions.    \"It  is  not  the\r\n\nfunction   of    the   federal   courts   to   evaluate   the\r\n\nappropriateness of  agency employment  standards but  only to\r\n\nsafeguard   against   'arbitrary,  capricious   or  otherwise\r\n\nunlawful'  standards.\"    Taub,  957  F.2d  at  10  (citation\r                                          \r\n\nomitted).   The  Navy's no-leave-for-incarceration  policy is\r\n\nnone  of  these,  given  the importance  of  maintaining  the\r\n\npublic's confidence in the integrity of the armed forces.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n          We hold that the Navy may  reasonably apply its no-\r\n\nleave-for-incarceration  policy  to  all  of  its  employees,\r\n\ndisabled and non-disabled alike.  Because the  Rehabilitation\r\n\nAct  does not  require otherwise, Leary  is not  a \"qualified\r\n\nindividual  with   a   [disability]\"  who   with   reasonable\r\n\naccommodation could have fulfilled the \"essential function[]\"\r\n\nof attending work as scheduled.  29 C.F.R.   1614.203(a)(6).\r\n\n          From our discussion above, it  follows that Leary's\r\n\ndisability  was not a reason  for his termination.   The Navy\r\n\nplaced  Leary on  unauthorized  leave status  before he  ever\r\n\nsought to connect  his incarceration to his alcoholism.   The\r\n\nrecord leaves us with no doubt that the Navy  applied its no-\r\n\nleave policy  to Leary without regard to  his disability, and\r\n\nultimately discharged  Leary because and only  because of his\r\n\nexcessive unauthorized absence.  \r\n\n          Leary, however, argues that  there is a question of\r\n\nmaterial fact  as  to whether  there  is a  sufficient  nexus\r\n\nbetween his  disability and the behavior that resulted in his\r\n\nremoval to establish  that he was  discharged because of  his\r\n\ndisability.     Disregarding  arguendo   Leary's  failure  to\r                                                  \r\n\nestablish  that   he  is   a  qualified  individual   with  a\r\n\ndisability,  and  his  failure   to  rebut  the  Navy's  non-\r\n\ndiscriminatory justification for his discharge,  and focusing\r\n\nour inquiry solely on  the chain of events that  preceded his\r\n\nremoval, we find any causal nexus insufficient as a matter of\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nlaw to establish  a reasonable  inference of  discrimination.\r\n\nWe would reach the same  conclusion even if we were  to apply\r\n\nthe \"but for\" test of  causation that Leary appropriates from\r\n\nour  \"mixed  motive\" labor  relation  cases.   See  Coletti's\r                                                                         \r\n\nFurniture, Inc. v.  NLRB, 550 F.2d 1292 (1st Cir. 1977).  The\r                                    \r\n\nfact  is that,  notwithstanding his  alcoholism and  alcohol-\r\n\nrelated conduct,  Leary would not have  been incarcerated and\r\n\nplaced in need of  emergency leave had he  been able to  make\r\n\nbail.  Leary's own brief states that \"[h]e was incarcerated .\r\n\n. . because  he was unable to  post a . .  . cash bail.\"   It\r\n\ncannot be argued that  the circumstances of incarceration and\r\n\ninability  to  make  bail  are  uniquely  or  even  specially\r\n\nassociated  with Leary's  disability.   Whatever relationship\r\n\nmay exist between  his alcoholism and the  events giving rise\r\n\nto  this case, Leary has not shown facts sufficient to defeat\r\n\nsummary judgment  with  respect  to his  claim  that  he  was\r\n\nremoved  from   government  service  on  the   basis  of  his\r\n\ndisability.\r\n\n          Leary also argues that there is  a genuine issue of\r\n\nmaterial fact as to whether other non-disabled Navy employees\r\n\nwere  granted   leave  for   incarceration  or   were  simply\r\n\nreprimanded rather than removed for unauthorized absence.  He\r\n\nrefers to two  employees who requested leave  periods of five\r\n\ndays  or less, and a third  employee whose eighteen-day leave\r\n\nrequest was denied,  although he was  not discharged.

Leary, a civilian employee of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (\"Shipyard\") and the United States Navy, was removed from government service for \"excessive unauthorized absence\" after he was denied requested leave for the time that he spent in jail following his arrest for driving while intoxicated.  After exhausting administrative remedies, Leary filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Maine against defendant-appellee John H. Dalton, Secretary of the Navy.  Leary's complaint alleged that he is an alcoholic and, therefore, an \"individual with a handicap\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. Secs. 701-797b (\"Act\"), and that the Navy discriminated against him in violation of the Act by terminating his employment on the basis of his disability.  Leary appeals the district court's order granting summary judgment in favor of the Navy.  After carefully reviewing the record and considering Leary's arguments, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning October 1, 1984, Leary was employed by the Navy as a WG-10 electrician in Shop 97 at the Shipyard.  Between 1985 and 1989, Leary received numerous incentive awards and was \"Suggestor of the Month\" in March, 1989.  Leary became a Union Shop Steward in March, 1988 and rose to the rank of Chief Steward for his shop area in January, 1989.  On his last performance appraisal, covering the period June 1, 1988 through May 31, 1989, he received a rating of \"highly satisfactory.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 26, 1989, while off duty, Leary was arrested by state police in Concord, New Hampshire, for a second offense of driving while intoxicated, driving after license revocation, possessing marijuana, possessing cocaine, transporting a controlled drug, resisting arrest, and assaulting a police officer.  Leary was incarcerated in New Hampshire at the Merrimack County Jail, subject to a $10,000 cash bail.  Unable to make bail, Leary remained incarcerated until September 13, 1989.  When he failed to report to work on August 28, 1989, without having either requested leave in advance or notified his supervisor of his absence, Leary was placed on unauthorized leave status (\"Z leave\").  As of the date of his arrest, Leary had accumulated 129.5 hours of earned annual leave.  On August 29, 1989, Leary's sister called Richard Lavoie, Temporary Service Shop General Foreman, to request on Leary's behalf that he be granted earned annual leave to cover the period of his absence.  On August 30, 1989, Leary himself called Lavoie to request emergency annual leave during his incarceration.  Leary's request was denied and he was informed that he would be carried on Z leave status until he returned to duty.  Leary returned to the Shipyard after twelve consecutive work days of unauthorized absence.  Upon his return, he appealed the denial of his request for emergency annual leave through the union grievance process, but after a hearing and due consideration by Shipyard management, the grievance was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By letter dated October 3, 1989, Leary received notice of the Navy's proposed action to remove him from government service for the following reasons:  (i) his arrest on August 26, 1989 on the charges set forth supra;  (ii) his failure to report to work on August 28, 1989, and his failure to request leave in advance or to notify his supervisor or shop officials as to the reason for his absence;  and (iii) his unauthorized absence during the period August 28 through September 13, 1989.  On October 19, 1989, Leary and his representatives met with Gary Alamed, Administrative Officer, to make an oral reply to the proposed action.  At this meeting, and apparently for the first time, Leary made it known that he had problems with alcohol and drugs and that he considered himself to be protected by the Act.  He also stated that he was seeking help for these problems from the Shipyard's Employee Assistance Program.  By letter dated December 4, 1989, Leary received notice of the Shipyard's decision to remove him from government service, effective December 11, 1989, for excessive unauthorized absence during the period August 28, 1989, through September 13, 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 21, 1989, Leary filed an appeal of the Navy's decision with the Merit Systems Protection Board (\"MSPB\"), in which he alleged discrimination on the basis of a disability and reprisal for his union activity.  He also claimed disparate treatment, alleging that other, non-disabled employees had been granted leave for incarceration.  On April 9, 1990, after an evidentiary hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") sustained the Navy's action.  With respect to Leary's claim of discrimination on the basis of a disability, the ALJ found that, although Leary established that he was disabled due to alcohol and drug dependency, the unauthorized absence for which he was removed was neither caused by, nor entirely a manifestation of, his disability.  Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that Leary failed to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the Act.  The ALJ also concluded that there was no support for Leary's claim of disparate treatment, finding, inter alia, that the employees alleged to have been granted leave for incarceration were not similarly situated because they were assigned to different shops and supervisors, or because they were absent for fewer than five consecutive days and therefore did not run afoul of Navy leave policy, or because the supervisor granting leave was not aware that leave was requested to cover jail time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By final order dated January 10, 1992, the MSPB denied Leary's petition for review before the full Board.  Leary thereafter sought review of the final MSPB decision with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\").  On August 19, 1993, the EEOC affirmed, finding, inter alia, that, although his problems with alcohol and drug abuse constituted a disability covered by the Act, Leary had failed to establish a sufficient causal nexus between his disability and his termination to make out a claim of discrimination based on disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 24, 1993, Leary filed a complaint in the district court alleging discrimination under the Act and disparate treatment.  On April 28, 1994, the Navy moved for summary judgment.  The motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who, on September 19, 1994, recommended that the motion be granted on the ground that Leary failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the Act.  On October 3, 1994, Leary filed his objection to the magistrate judge's Recommended Decision.  On October 26, 1994, the district court, having made a de novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the magistrate judge, affirmed the Recommended Decision and granted summary judgment for the Navy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, evaluating the facts and inferences that may reasonably be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Morrissey v. Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank, F.S.B., 54 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir.1995).  Summary judgment is appropriate only if \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  A material fact is one \" 'that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.' \"  Morrissey, 54 F.3d at 31 (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).  An issue of material fact is genuine \"if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nonmoving party \"may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of [its] pleading, but ... must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e);  Coll v. PB Diagnostic Systems, Inc., 50 F.3d 1115, 1121 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leary makes two arguments on appeal.  First, he contends that the district court overlooked two genuine issues of material fact:  whether his disability--alcoholism--\"manifested itself as, or resulted in, the actions which led to his consequent incarceration and absence from work,\" and therefore constituted the reason for his termination;  and whether, with regard to his allegation of disparate treatment, other non-disabled Navy employees were granted leave for their periods of incarceration, or were merely reprimanded (rather than terminated) for their conduct.  Leary argues in the alternative that the district court should have applied a \"but for\" test to determine whether he was terminated because of his alcoholism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by ironing out a procedural wrinkle.  Although the district court decided this case under Sec. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 794 (prohibiting disability discrimination by non-federal recipients of federal funds), Leary actually invoked Sec. 501 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 791, in his complaint.  Section 501(b) imposes an affirmative duty on every \"department, agency, and instrumentality ... in the executive branch\" of the federal government to provide adequate hiring, placement, and advancement opportunities for individuals with disabilities.  Some circuits view Sec. 501, accordingly, as the exclusive right of action for federal employees who suffer disability discrimination in the course of their direct employment.  See Johnston v. Horne, 875 F.2d 1415 (9th Cir.1989);  Johnson v. United States Postal Serv., 861 F.2d 1475, 1478 (10th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 811, 110 S.Ct. 54, 107 L.Ed.2d 23 (1989);  McGuinness v. United States Postal Serv., 744 F.2d 1318, 1321 (7th Cir.1984).  Other circuits, ours included, have permitted such claims to be brought under both Sec. 501 and Sec. 504.  See, e.g., Taub v. Frank, 957 F.2d 8, 10 (1st Cir.1992) (deciding a Sec. 504 suit by a federal postal employee and setting forth the elements of a prima facie case under that section);  Little v. FBI, 1 F.3d 255 (4th Cir.1993) (noting that federal employee sued employing agency under both Sec. 501 and Sec. 504);  Smith v. United States Postal Serv., 742 F.2d 257, 260 (6th Cir.1984);  Prewitt v. United States Postal Serv., 662 F.2d 292, 304 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The differences between the two sections may be significant in some cases (though not this one, as we shall explain).  Not only is it unclear whether the right of action under Sec. 504 overlaps with that in Sec. 501, it is also unclear, in light of recent amendments to the Rehabilitation Act, whether the two sections require the same showing of causation.  As amended in 1992, both sections now incorporate the liability standards of Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. Secs. 12111-12117.  See 29 U.S.C. Secs. 791(g), 794(d).  Section 504 alone, however, continues to require a showing that the plaintiff's disability was the sole reason for the defendant's adverse action.  See 29 U.S.C. Sec. 794(a) (\"No otherwise qualified individual with a disability ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency or by the United States Postal Service.\")  (emphasis added).  The precise relationship between the ADA's liability standards and the sole causation test is not well settled.  And, to compound these difficulties, it is not obvious whether the 1992 amendments apply to Leary's suit, which accrued and was administratively pending before the amendments took effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore regard the applicability of Sec. 504 and its sole causation test in this federal employment suit as an open question;  but one that we need not reach here.  Leary agrees on appeal that his claim arises under Sec. 504, and that he bears the burden of demonstrating that he was terminated \"solely by reason of\" his disability.  More importantly, we think that the judgment for the Navy should be affirmed, even assuming in Leary's favor that disability discrimination need only be a reason, as opposed to the sole reason, for his termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any claim under the Rehabilitation Act, the plaintiff must first establish that s/he has a disability covered by the Act.  The governing regulations define an \"individual with a [disability]\" as one who \"(i) Has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities;  (ii) Has a record of such an impairment;  or (iii) Is regarded as having such an impairment.\"  29 C.F.R. Sec. 1614.203.  It is well settled that alcoholism is a disability within the meaning of the Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See, e.g., Cook v. Department of Mental Health, Retardation &amp; Hosps., 10 F.3d 17, 24 (1st Cir.1993);  Little, 1 F.3d at 257;  Fuller v. Frank, 916 F.2d 558, 561 (9th Cir.1990).  For the purposes of this appeal, the Navy concedes that Leary is an alcoholic and is therefore an individual with a disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leary must also show that with respect to his employment, he is a \"qualified individual with a [disability] who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question....\"  29 C.F.R. Sec. 1614.203(a)(6) (implementing 29 U.S.C. Sec. 791).  See also 29 U.S.C. Sec. 794 (protecting only the \"otherwise qualified individual with a disability\").  In this case, the \"essential function[ ]\" is showing up for work as scheduled, unless leave is authorized.  Finally, regardless of which section of the Act applies, Leary must show at a minimum that his disability was a reason--if not the sole reason--for his discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leary fails to establish either the second or the third element of his claim.  It is the Navy's policy that leave will be granted only for bona fide reasons--for example, a serious accident or illness or death in the employee's immediate family, or other circumstances over which the employee has no control.  The Navy does not consider incarceration to be a bona fide reason for granting leave of any kind.  To grant leave to employees serving time in jail, says the Navy, is to violate the public's confidence in the Navy and its personnel, the maintenance of which is one of the \"Bedrock Standards of Conduct for Department of the Navy Personnel.\"   Accordingly, the Human Resources Department of the Shipyard uniformly advises supervisors and employees that it is never appropriate to approve leave of any kind to cover the period of an employee's incarceration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Navy defines excessive unauthorized absence as unauthorized absence for more than five consecutive work days.  According to the Navy's \"Schedule of Disciplinary Offenses and Recommended Remedies for Civilian Employees,\" an employee's excessive unauthorized absence--twelve consecutive work days, in Leary's case--may result in disciplinary action ranging from reprimand to removal, even for a first offense.  It appears, then, that Leary was placed on unauthorized leave status, denied leave for incarceration, and discharged for excessive unauthorized absence, all in accordance with established Navy policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that Leary's incarceration was a \"manifestation\" of his alcoholism, cf. Teahan v. Metro-North Commuter R. Co., 951 F.2d 511, 515 (2d Cir.1991) (assuming a causal relationship between employee's alcoholism and his absenteeism), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 54, 121 L.Ed.2d 24 (1992), we reject the argument that Leary should have been allowed to draw upon his accrued annual leave as a \"reasonable accommodation\" for his disability.  First, Leary does not dispute the Navy's contention that he neither advised the Navy of his alcoholism nor sought accommodation of any kind until after he returned to duty following his incarceration.  So far as the record shows, the Navy denied Leary's initial requests for leave without knowing the nature of the incident that resulted in his incarceration.  We have said, in the context of a Sec. 504 suit, that an institution \"can be expected to respond only to what it knows (or is chargeable with knowing).\"  Wynne v. Tufts Univ.  Sch. of Medicine, 976 F.2d 791, 795 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1845, 123 L.Ed.2d 470 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if Leary had given the Navy sufficient notice of his need for accommodation, the Act neither prevents employers from holding \"persons suffering from alcoholism ... [to] reasonable rules of conduct,\" nor protects alcoholics from the consequences of their own misconduct.  Little, 1 F.3d at 258 (quoting 43 Op.  Att'y Gen. No. 12, 1977 WL 17999 at * 1). See also Copeland v. Philadelphia Police Dep't, 840 F.2d 1139, 1149 (3d Cir.1988) (\"a police department is justified in concluding that it cannot properly accommodate a user of illegal drugs within its ranks....\"), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1004, 109 S.Ct. 1636, 104 L.Ed.2d 153 (1989);  Wilber v. Brady, 780 F.Supp. 837, 840 (D.D.C.1992) (the Rehabilitation Act is not designed to \"insulate [individuals with disabilities] from disciplinary actions which would be taken against any employee regardless of his status\").  As we have observed, government entities have the discretionary authority to determine what policies are necessary to the execution of their assigned missions.  \"It is not the function of the federal courts to evaluate the appropriateness of agency employment standards but only to safeguard against 'arbitrary, capricious or otherwise unlawful' standards.\"  Taub, 957 F.2d at 10 (citation omitted).  The Navy's no-leave-for-incarceration policy is none of these, given the importance of maintaining the public's confidence in the integrity of the armed forces.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the Navy may reasonably apply its no-leave-for-incarceration policy to all of its employees, disabled and non-disabled alike.  Because the Rehabilitation Act does not require otherwise, Leary is not a \"qualified individual with a [disability]\" who with reasonable accommodation could have fulfilled the \"essential function[ ]\" of attending work as scheduled.  29 C.F.R. Sec. 1614.203(a)(6).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From our discussion above, it follows that Leary's disability was not a reason for his termination.  The Navy placed Leary on unauthorized leave status before he ever sought to connect his incarceration to his alcoholism.  The record leaves us with no doubt that the Navy applied its no-leave policy to Leary without regard to his disability, and ultimately discharged Leary because and only because of his excessive unauthorized absence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leary, however, argues that there is a question of material fact as to whether there is a sufficient nexus between his disability and the behavior that resulted in his removal to establish that he was discharged because of his disability.  Disregarding arguendo Leary's failure to establish that he is a qualified individual with a disability, and his failure to rebut the Navy's non-discriminatory justification for his discharge, and focusing our inquiry solely on the chain of events that preceded his removal, we find any causal nexus insufficient as a matter of law to establish a reasonable inference of discrimination.  We would reach the same conclusion even if we were to apply the \"but for\" test of causation that Leary appropriates from our \"mixed motive\" labor relation cases.  See Coletti's Furniture, Inc. v. NLRB, 550 F.2d 1292 (1st Cir.1977).  The fact is that, notwithstanding his alcoholism and alcohol-related conduct, Leary would not have been incarcerated and placed in need of emergency leave had he been able to make bail.  Leary's own brief states that \"[h]e was incarcerated ... because he was unable to post a ... cash bail.\"   It cannot be argued that the circumstances of incarceration and inability to make bail are uniquely or even specially associated with Leary's disability.  Whatever relationship may exist between his alcoholism and the events giving rise to this case, Leary has not shown facts sufficient to defeat summary judgment with respect to his claim that he was removed from government service on the basis of his disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leary also argues that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether other non-disabled Navy employees were granted leave for incarceration or were simply reprimanded rather than removed for unauthorized absence.  He refers to two employees who requested leave periods of five days or less, and a third employee whose eighteen-day leave request was denied, although he was not discharged.  These cursory submissions do not set forth \"specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

Leary, a civilian employee of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (\"Shipyard\") and the United States Navy, was removed from government service for \"excessive unauthorized absence\" after he was denied requested leave for the time that he spent in jail following his arrest for driving while intoxicated.  After exhausting administrative remedies, Leary filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Maine against defendant-appellee John H. Dalton, Secretary of the Navy.  Leary's complaint alleged that he is an alcoholic and, therefore, an \"individual with a handicap\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. Secs. 701-797b (\"Act\"), and that the Navy discriminated against him in violation of the Act by terminating his employment on the basis of his disability.  Leary appeals the district court's order granting summary judgment in favor of the Navy.  After carefully reviewing the record and considering Leary's arguments, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning October 1, 1984, Leary was employed by the Navy as a WG-10 electrician in Shop 97 at the Shipyard.  Between 1985 and 1989, Leary received numerous incentive awards and was \"Suggestor of the Month\" in March, 1989.  Leary became a Union Shop Steward in March, 1988 and rose to the rank of Chief Steward for his shop area in January, 1989.  On his last performance appraisal, covering the period June 1, 1988 through May 31, 1989, he received a rating of \"highly satisfactory.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 26, 1989, while off duty, Leary was arrested by state police in Concord, New Hampshire, for a second offense of driving while intoxicated, driving after license revocation, possessing marijuana, possessing cocaine, transporting a controlled drug, resisting arrest, and assaulting a police officer.  Leary was incarcerated in New Hampshire at the Merrimack County Jail, subject to a $10,000 cash bail.  Unable to make bail, Leary remained incarcerated until September 13, 1989.  When he failed to report to work on August 28, 1989, without having either requested leave in advance or notified his supervisor of his absence, Leary was placed on unauthorized leave status (\"Z leave\").  As of the date of his arrest, Leary had accumulated 129.5 hours of earned annual leave.  On August 29, 1989, Leary's sister called Richard Lavoie, Temporary Service Shop General Foreman, to request on Leary's behalf that he be granted earned annual leave to cover the period of his absence.  On August 30, 1989, Leary himself called Lavoie to request emergency annual leave during his incarceration.  Leary's request was denied and he was informed that he would be carried on Z leave status until he returned to duty.  Leary returned to the Shipyard after twelve consecutive work days of unauthorized absence.  Upon his return, he appealed the denial of his request for emergency annual leave through the union grievance process, but after a hearing and due consideration by Shipyard management, the grievance was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By letter dated October 3, 1989, Leary received notice of the Navy's proposed action to remove him from government service for the following reasons:  (i) his arrest on August 26, 1989 on the charges set <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">forth</span> supra</span>;  (ii) his failure to report to work on August 28, 1989, and his failure to request leave in advance or to notify his supervisor or shop officials as to the reason for his absence;  and (iii) his unauthorized absence during the period August 28 through September 13, 1989.  On October 19, 1989, Leary and his representatives met with Gary Alamed, Administrative Officer, to make an oral reply to the proposed action.  At this meeting, and apparently for the first time, Leary made it known that he had problems with alcohol and drugs and that he considered himself to be protected by the Act.  He also stated that he was seeking help for these problems from the Shipyard's Employee Assistance Program.  By letter dated December 4, 1989, Leary received notice of the Shipyard's decision to remove him from government service, effective December 11, 1989, for excessive unauthorized absence during the period August 28, 1989, through September 13, 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 21, 1989, Leary filed an appeal of the Navy's decision with the Merit Systems Protection Board (\"MSPB\"), in which he alleged discrimination on the basis of a disability and reprisal for his union activity.  He also claimed disparate treatment, alleging that other, non-disabled employees had been granted leave for incarceration.  On April 9, 1990, after an evidentiary hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") sustained the Navy's action.  With respect to Leary's claim of discrimination on the basis of a disability, the ALJ found that, although Leary established that he was disabled due to alcohol and drug dependency, the unauthorized absence for which he was removed was neither caused by, nor entirely a manifestation of, his disability.  Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that Leary failed to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the Act.  The ALJ also concluded that there was no support for Leary's claim of disparate treatment, finding, inter alia, that the employees alleged to have been granted leave for incarceration were not similarly situated because they were assigned to different shops and supervisors, or because they were absent for fewer than five consecutive days and therefore did not run afoul of Navy leave policy, or because the supervisor granting leave was not aware that leave was requested to cover jail time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By final order dated January 10, 1992, the MSPB denied Leary's petition for review before the full Board.  Leary thereafter sought review of the final MSPB decision with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\").  On August 19, 1993, the EEOC affirmed, finding, inter alia, that, although his problems with alcohol and drug abuse constituted a disability covered by the Act, Leary had failed to establish a sufficient causal nexus between his disability and his termination to make out a claim of discrimination based on disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 24, 1993, Leary filed a complaint in the district court alleging discrimination under the Act and disparate treatment.  On April 28, 1994, the Navy moved for summary judgment.  The motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who, on September 19, 1994, recommended that the motion be granted on the ground that Leary failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the Act.  On October 3, 1994, Leary filed his objection to the magistrate judge's Recommended Decision.  On October 26, 1994, the district court, having made a de novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the magistrate judge, affirmed the Recommended Decision and granted summary judgment for the Navy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leary makes two arguments on appeal.  First, he contends that the district court overlooked two genuine issues of material fact:  whether his disability--alcoholism--\"manifested itself as, or resulted in, the actions which led to his consequent incarceration and absence from work,\" and therefore constituted the reason for his termination;  and whether, with regard to his allegation of disparate treatment, other non-disabled Navy employees were granted leave for their periods of incarceration, or were merely reprimanded (rather than terminated) for their conduct.  Leary argues in the alternative that the district court should have applied a \"but for\" test to determine whether he was terminated because of his alcoholism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by ironing out a procedural wrinkle.  Although the district court decided this case under Sec. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 794 (prohibiting disability discrimination by non-federal recipients of federal funds), Leary actually invoked Sec. 501 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 791, in his complaint.  Section 501(b) imposes an affirmative duty on every \"department, agency, and instrumentality ... in the executive branch\" of the federal government to provide adequate hiring, placement, and advancement opportunities for individuals with disabilities.  Some circuits view Sec. 501, accordingly, as the exclusive right of action for federal employees who suffer disability discrimination in the course of their direct employment.  See Johnston v. Horne, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524103\"><a href=\"/opinion/524103/49-fair-emplpraccas-1806-50-empl-prac-dec-p-39056-51-empl-prac/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1415</span> </a></span>(9th Cir.1989);  Johnson v.

Other circuits, ours included, have permitted such claims to be brought under both Sec. 501 and Sec. 504.  See, e.g., Taub v.

Not only is it unclear whether the right of action under Sec. 504 overlaps with that in Sec. 501, it is also unclear, in light of recent amendments to the Rehabilitation Act, whether the two sections require the same showing of causation.  As amended in 1992, both sections now incorporate the liability standards of Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. Secs. 12111-12117.  See 29 U.S.C. Secs. 791(g), 794(d).  Section 504 alone, however, continues to require a showing that the plaintiff's disability was the sole reason for the defendant's adverse action.  See 29 U.S.C. Sec. 794(a) (\"No otherwise qualified individual with a disability ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency or by the United States Postal Service.\")  (emphasis added).  The precise relationship between the ADA's liability standards and the sole causation test is not well settled.  And, to compound these difficulties, it is not obvious whether the 1992 amendments apply to Leary's suit, which accrued and was administratively pending before the amendments took effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore regard the applicability of Sec. 504 and its sole causation test in this federal employment suit as an open question;  but one that we need not reach here.  Leary agrees on appeal that his claim arises under Sec. 504, and that he bears the burden of demonstrating that he was terminated \"solely by reason of\" his disability.  More importantly, we think that the judgment for the Navy should be affirmed, even assuming in Leary's favor that disability discrimination need only be a reason, as opposed to the sole reason, for his termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any claim under the Rehabilitation Act, the plaintiff must first establish that s/he has a disability covered by the Act.  The governing regulations define an \"individual with a [disability]\" as one who \"(i) Has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities;  (ii) Has a record of such an impairment;  or (iii) Is regarded as having such an impairment.\"  29 C.F.R. Sec. 1614.203.  It is well settled that alcoholism is a disability within the meaning of the Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See, e.g., Cook v.

For the purposes of this appeal, the Navy concedes that Leary is an alcoholic and is therefore an individual with a disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leary must also show that with respect to his employment, he is a \"qualified individual with a [disability] who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question....\"  29 C.F.R. Sec. 1614.203(a)(6) (implementing 29 U.S.C. Sec. 791).  See also 29 U.S.C. Sec. 794 (protecting only the \"otherwise qualified individual with a disability\").  In this case, the \"essential function[ ]\" is showing up for work as scheduled, unless leave is authorized.  Finally, regardless of which section of the Act applies, Leary must show at a minimum that his disability was a reason--if not the sole reason--for his discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leary fails to establish either the second or the third element of his claim.  It is the Navy's policy that leave will be granted only for bona fide reasons--for example, a serious accident or illness or death in the employee's immediate family, or other circumstances over which the employee has no control.  The Navy does not consider incarceration to be a bona fide reason for granting leave of any kind.  To grant leave to employees serving time in jail, says the Navy, is to violate the public's confidence in the Navy and its personnel, the maintenance of which is one of the \"Bedrock Standards of Conduct for Department of the Navy Personnel.\"   Accordingly, the Human Resources Department of the Shipyard uniformly advises supervisors and employees that it is never appropriate to approve leave of any kind to cover the period of an employee's incarceration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Navy defines excessive unauthorized absence as unauthorized absence for more than five consecutive work days.  According to the Navy's \"Schedule of Disciplinary Offenses and Recommended Remedies for Civilian Employees,\" an employee's excessive unauthorized absence--twelve consecutive work days, in Leary's case--may result in disciplinary action ranging from reprimand to removal, even for a first offense.  It appears, then, that Leary was placed on unauthorized leave status, denied leave for incarceration, and discharged for excessive unauthorized absence, all in accordance with established Navy policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that Leary's incarceration was a \"manifestation\" of his alcoholism, cf.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span> </span>(1992), we reject the argument that Leary should have been allowed to draw upon his accrued annual leave as a \"reasonable accommodation\" for his disability.  First, Leary does not dispute the Navy's contention that he neither advised the Navy of his alcoholism nor sought accommodation of any kind until after he returned to duty following his incarceration.  So far as the record shows, the Navy denied Leary's initial requests for leave without knowing the nature of the incident that resulted in his incarceration.  We have said, in the context of a Sec. 504 suit, that an institution \"can be expected to respond only to what it knows (or is chargeable with knowing).\"  Wynne v. Tufts Univ.

Sec. 1614.203(a)(6).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From our discussion above, it follows that Leary's disability was not a reason for his termination.  The Navy placed Leary on unauthorized leave status before he ever sought to connect his incarceration to his alcoholism.  The record leaves us with no doubt that the Navy applied its no-leave policy to Leary without regard to his disability, and ultimately discharged Leary because and only because of his excessive unauthorized absence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leary, however, argues that there is a question of material fact as to whether there is a sufficient nexus between his disability and the behavior that resulted in his removal to establish that he was discharged because of his disability.  Disregarding arguendo Leary's failure to establish that he is a qualified individual with a disability, and his failure to rebut the Navy's non-discriminatory justification for his discharge, and focusing our inquiry solely on the chain of events that preceded his removal, we find any causal nexus insufficient as a matter of law to establish a reasonable inference of discrimination.  We would reach the same conclusion even if we were to apply the \"but for\" test of causation that Leary appropriates from our \"mixed motive\" labor relation cases.  See Coletti's Furniture, Inc. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"343569\"><a href=\"/opinion/343569/colettis-furniture-inc-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1292</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1977).  The fact is that, notwithstanding his alcoholism and alcohol-related conduct, Leary would not have been incarcerated and placed in need of emergency leave had he been able to make bail.  Leary's own brief states that \"[h]e was incarcerated ... because he was unable to post a ... cash bail.\"   It cannot be argued that the circumstances of incarceration and inability to make bail are uniquely or even specially associated with Leary's disability.  Whatever relationship may exist between his alcoholism and the events giving rise to this case, Leary has not shown facts sufficient to defeat summary judgment with respect to his claim that he was removed from government service on the basis of his disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leary also argues that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether other non-disabled Navy employees were granted leave for incarceration or were simply reprimanded rather than removed for unauthorized absence.  He refers to two employees who requested leave periods of five days or less, and a third employee whose eighteen-day leave request was denied, although he was not discharged.  These cursory submissions do not set forth \"specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's order granting summary judgment for the defendant-appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In 1992, the Rehabilitation Act was amended to substitute the term \"disability\" for \"handicap.\"   The regulations promulgated under the Act, however, continue to employ the term \"handicap.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We note that the statute was amended in 1990 to exclude (for purposes of Secs. 793 and 794 as these sections relate to employment) from the term \"individual with a disability\" \"any individual who is an alcoholic whose current use of alcohol prevents such individual from performing the duties of the job in question or whose employment, by reason of such current alcohol abuse, would constitute a direct threat to property or the safety of others.\"  29 U.S.C. Sec. 706(8)(C)(v)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
