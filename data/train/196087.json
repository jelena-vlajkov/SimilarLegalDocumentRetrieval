Finally, she asserts that\r\n\nthe  district court  judge should  have recused  himself from\r\n\nthis case.\r\n\n     Section 1915(d) provides  the district court  discretion\r\n\nto dismiss an in forma pauperis action where, inter alia, the\r                                                                    \r\n\nclaim is  \"based on an indisputably  meritless legal theory.\"\r\n\nNeitzke v.
