We have reviewed the record and briefs\r                                \n\nand now  affirm  the default  judgment  entered below.    The\n\ndistrict court  implicitly authorized the  extension of  time\n\nfor  service  when  it  granted the  Secretary's  motion  for\n\nappointment of a special process  server, vacated its July 6,\n\n1993  judgment  of  dismissal, and  granted  the  Secretary's\n\nmotion  for  entry  of  a  default  judgment.      We  reject\n\nappellant's hypertechnical  reading of  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 4(j)\n\nand 6(b)(2), and we find no abuse of the court's considerable\n\ndiscretion in extending the time for service.  Similarly, the\n\ncourt  did not  abuse its  discretion in  denying appellant's\n\nmotion to vacate the default judgment.\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\r\n",
