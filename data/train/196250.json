See Rule\r                                                                    \r\n\n9(b), Rules Governing Section  2255 Proceedings in the United\r\n\nStates District Courts (\"[a]  second or successive motion may\r\n\nbe dismissed if the  judge finds that it fails to  allege new\r\n\nor different  grounds for relief and  the prior determination\r\n\nwas on the merits\").\r\n\n          Second, appellant's assertion that his attorney did\r\n\nnot present  any defense at  trial plainly is  wrong; counsel\r                            \r\n\nspecifically argued that venue was not proper in the district\r\n\nof  Maine.  That we  rejected this argument  on direct appeal\r\n\ndoes not  transform appellant's trial  into one  of which  it\r\n\ncould be said that no defense was mounted.  As a result, even\r\r\n\nif  we  were to  consider appellant's     2255 motion  on the\r\n\nmerits, it would fail.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
