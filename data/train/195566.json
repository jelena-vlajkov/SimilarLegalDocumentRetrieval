FDIC, 315  U.S. 447\n                                                  \n\n(1942), and its statutory  counterpart, 12 U.S.C.   1823(e).

The Loan  Agreement set the\n\nmaximum loan  principal at $9  million, with disbursements  to be\n       \n\nmade over  time subject  to certain  conditions specified in  the\n\nLoan Agreement.   Contemporaneously,  the Bay  Street principals,\n\ndefendants-appellants John Ryan,2 William  J. Byrne and Joseph F.\n\nTimilty, jointly and  severally guarantied the construction  loan\n\nto  the extent of $2.5 million (the Multiple Guaranty).  Pursuant\n\n                    \n\n     1The material facts are related in the  light most favorable\nto  defendants-appellants,  against  whom  summary  judgment  was\ngranted.  See  Velez-Gomez v.  SMA Life Assur.  Co., 8 F.3d  873,\n                                                   \n874-75 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n     2J.  Christopher  Robinson,  trustee in  bankruptcy  of  the\nchapter 7 estate of  John Ryan, has been substituted  as a party.\nSee Fed. R. App. P. 43.\n   \n\n                                3\n\nto a written side agreement, Ryan promised to indemnify Byrne and\n\nTimilty for  any liability  incurred under the  Multiple Guaranty\n\n(the Indemnification Agreement).  At the time the Indemnification\n\nAgreement was executed,  Ryan had  a net worth  of $5.7  million.\n\nFMB's records contain no  reference to the Indemnification Agree-\n\nment.\n\n          In  June 1987,  Bay  Street failed  to satisfy  certain\n\nconditions which constituted default events under the Loan Agree-\n\nment.  Bay  Street attempted to  negotiate with FMB  to cure  the\n\ndefaults.  Finally,  at a meeting on February 6, 1989 (the Arnone\n\nmeeting),  FMB vice-president Richard  Arnone informed  Ryan that\n\nFMB  would release  the  undisbursed balance  of  the $9  million\n\nconstruction loan, notwithstanding any  past or future Bay Street\n\ndefaults, if Ryan would provide  FMB with an additional  guaranty\n\n(the  Additional Guaranty).   On  February 23, Ryan  executed the\n\nAdditional Guaranty, which expressly stated that he was guaranty-\n\ning an additional $6.5 million in order \"to induce  [FMB] to make\n\nfurther  loan  advances  pursuant  to  the  [L]oan  [A]greement.\"\n                                                               \n\n(emphasis added).  FMB thereupon advanced Bay Street another $1.5\n\nmillion, bringing total  advances under the Loan  Agreement to $6\n\nmillion.   By May 1989, Bay  Street had yet to  cure its previous\n\ndefaults under the Loan Agreement.  At  about the same time, Ryan\n\nnotified FMB that he was  repudiating both the Multiple  Guaranty\n\nand the  Additional Guaranty.   As  Ryan and  Bay Street were  in\n\ndefault,  FMB demanded payment in  full pursuant to  the terms of\n\n                                4\n\nthe  Loan  Agreement and  the  loan guaranties.    The defendants\n\nrejected FMB's demand.\n\n          In  June  1989, FMB  initiated  the  present action  in\n\nMassachusetts Superior Court against Bay Street for breach of the\n\nLoan Agreement (Count 1);  Ryan, Byrne and Timilty for  breach of\n\nthe  Multiple  Guaranty (Count  2); and  Ryan  for breach  of the\n\nAdditional Guaranty (Count 3).   Bay Street and Ryan  filed coun-\n\nterclaims  for, inter alia, fraud in the inducement and breach of\n                          \n\nthe  Arnone meeting agreement.  In April 1990, the superior court\n\ngranted summary judgment for FMB on Counts 1 and 2, rejecting the\n\ndefense interposed  by Byrne  and Timilty  that FMB  had released\n\nthem  from  the Multiple  Guaranty  by  accepting the  Additional\n\nGuaranty, which  effected an unauthorized alteration  of the Loan\n\nAgreement.  The superior court  denied summary judgment on  Count\n\n3,  on the ground that  a genuine dispute  remained as to whether\n\nFMB had induced the Additional Guaranty through fraud.\n\n          In  June 1991, after  FMB had been  placed in receiver-\n\nship, FDIC  removed the  action to  federal district  court, then\n\nmoved for  summary judgment on Count  3 and on the  remaining Bay\n\nStreet and  Ryan counterclaims.   Ryan  and Bay  Street countered\n\nwith a motion for reconsideration of the superior court's summary\n\njudgment rulings on Counts 1 and 2.  In due  course, the district\n\ncourt granted summary judgment for FDIC on Count 3 and on  defen-\n\n                                5\n\ndants' counterclaims,  and denied the motion  for reconsideration\n\non Counts 1 and 2.  This appeal ensued.3\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nA.

Byrne  and\nTimilty challenge the rejection of  their defense to the Multiple\nGuaranty.   Bay Street's claims on appeal track Ryan's, save that\nBay  Street also asserts that the district court erred in finding\nno trialworthy issue relating  to Bay Street's state-law counter-\nclaims  charging bad  faith  and unfair  dealing.   These  latter\nclaims are deemed waived,  as they are unsupported by  any devel-\noped  argumentation.  See, e.g., RTC  v. Gold,      F.3d     ,   \n                                                                 \n(1st Cir.  1994) [No. 94-1080, slip  op. at 4 (1st  Cir.

No. 93-2237:  Bay Street and Ryan\n                                      \n\n          Bay Street  and Ryan contend  on appeal, as  before the\n\ndistrict court, that a  material issue of fact remained  on Count\n\n3,  concerning whether  FMB, through  Arnone, orally  promised to\n\nrelease  the entire  undisbursed balance  of its  loan commitment\n                   \n\nunder  the Loan  Agreement, notwithstanding  any past  and future\n\ndefaults  by Bay  Street.   Bay Street  and  Ryan argue  that the\n\nfollowing  language in  the  Additional  Guaranty was  ambiguous,\n\nviz., \"Ryan .  . . to induce [FMB] to  make further loan advances\n    \n\npursuant to  the loan  agreement referred to  below . .  . hereby\n\nunconditionally guarantees  . . .  $6,500,000.\"  Based  on Ryan's\n\naffidavit  attesting to the Arnone  meeting, see supra  p. 4, Bay\n                                                      \n\nStreet and Ryan argue  that a jury reasonably could find that the\n\nabove-quoted language represented a  commitment by FMB to advance\n\nthe  entire  undisbursed  balance ($4.5  million)  it  originally\n\nagreed to lend under  the Loan Agreement, without regard  to past\n\nor future defaults by Bay Street.\n\n          Their defense  is  not sustainable  against  FDIC,  see\n                                                                 \n\nD'Oench, Duhme  &amp; Co.  v.

The only  writing argu-\n\nably  evidencing an  ambiguous  commitment of  this  type is  the\n\nAdditional Guaranty itself, which merely states that Ryan provid-\n\ned  the Additional Guaranty \"to  induce FMB to  make further loan\n\nadvances.\"  Bay  Street and  Ryan implicitly concede  as much  by\n\nmaintaining that \"the meaning  and import of the [quoted]  phrase\n\nis  not clear  from the face  of the  document drawn  by [FMB] in\n\nwhich it appears, or  from any other document referred  to there-\n\nin.\" \n\n          Absent  extrinsic  evidence,  the  Additional  Guaranty\n\ncannot be read to require FMB to advance all loan funds remaining\n                                            \n\nundisbursed under the  Loan Agreement.

Their resource-\n\nful  theory is that the Indemnification Agreement, as a practical\n\nmatter, effectively  insulated them from risk  under the Multiple\n\nGuaranty, see  supra pp. 3-4, because Ryan's  net worth, approxi-\n                    \n\nmating $5.7 million at the time the Indemnification Agreement was\n\nexecuted, provided ample wherewithal to fund Ryan's commitment to\n\nindemnify  them for  any  liability incurred  under the  Multiple\n\nGuaranty.   But  because  the Additional  Guaranty increased  the\n\ntotal exposure on Ryan's  personal guaranties to $9 million  (the\n\n$2.5 million  Multiple Guaranty plus the  $6.5 million Additional\n\nGuaranty), well  beyond his  total net worth,  Byrne and  Timilty\n\ninsist that  their actual exposure  on the Multiple  Guaranty was\n                         \n\nthereby increased from zero  to $2.5 million.  Thus,  they argue,\n\nFMB materially modified the  Multiple Guaranty to their detriment\n\nby obtaining the Additional Guaranty from Ryan.  \n\n                    \n\n     6Byrne  and  Timilty  make  the related  argument  that  FMB\nbreached the Multiple Guaranty  provision prohibiting its  alter-\nation  without the written consent  of all three  guarantors.  As\nthis  argument was  never raised,  either in  state court  or the\ndistrict court, we decline to consider it.  See Gold, slip op. at\n                                                    \n4. \n\n                                12\n\n          The problem with this appealing argument is that it  is\n\npremised on a revisionist  view of the Indemnification Agreement;\n\nhence, it too is precluded under the D'Oench, Duhme doctrine, due\n                                                   \n\nto  the absence of any FMB record substantiating an obligation on\n\nthe part of FMB to refrain from undermining the Multiple Guaranty\n\nin this  manner.  Further,  even Byrne and Timilty  make no claim\n\nthat either  Ryan or FMB was under any contractual or other legal\n                    \n\nobligation  to refrain from increasing Ryan's liability to FMB or\n\nto obtain the approval of Byrne and Timilty before doing so.

The Loan Agreement set the maximum loan principal at $9 million, with disbursements to be made over time subject to certain conditions specified in the Loan Agreement.  Contemporaneously, the Bay Street principals, defendants-appellants John Ryan,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> William J. Byrne and Joseph F. Timilty, jointly and severally guarantied the construction loan to the extent of $2.5 million (the Multiple Guaranty).  Pursuant to a written side agreement, Ryan promised to indemnify Byrne and Timilty for any liability incurred under the Multiple Guaranty (the Indemnification Agreement).  At the time the Indemnification Agreement was executed, Ryan had a net worth of $5.7 million.  FMB's records contain no reference to the Indemnification Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1987, Bay Street failed to satisfy certain conditions which constituted default events under the Loan Agreement.  Bay Street attempted to negotiate with FMB to cure the defaults.  Finally, at a meeting on February 6, 1989 (the Arnone meeting), FMB vice-president Richard Arnone informed Ryan that FMB would release the undisbursed balance of the $9 million construction loan, notwithstanding any past or future Bay Street defaults, if Ryan would provide FMB with an additional guaranty (the Additional Guaranty).  On February 23, Ryan executed the Additional Guaranty, which expressly stated that he was guarantying an additional $6.5 million in order \"to induce [FMB] to make further loan advances pursuant to the [L]oan [A]greement.\"  (emphasis added).  FMB thereupon advanced Bay Street another $1.5 million, bringing total advances under the Loan Agreement to $6 million.  By May 1989, Bay Street had yet to cure its previous defaults under the Loan Agreement.  At about the same time, Ryan notified FMB that he was repudiating both the Multiple Guaranty and the Additional Guaranty.  As Ryan and Bay Street were in default, FMB demanded payment in full pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement and the loan guaranties.  The defendants rejected FMB's demand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1989, FMB initiated the present action in Massachusetts Superior Court against Bay Street for breach of the Loan Agreement (Count 1);  Ryan, Byrne and Timilty for breach of the Multiple Guaranty (Count 2);  and Ryan for breach of the Additional Guaranty (Count 3).  Bay Street and Ryan filed counterclaims for, inter alia, fraud in the inducement and breach of the Arnone meeting agreement.  In April 1990, the superior court granted summary judgment for FMB on Counts 1 and 2, rejecting the defense interposed by Byrne and Timilty that FMB had released them from the Multiple Guaranty by accepting the Additional Guaranty, which effected an unauthorized alteration of the Loan Agreement.  The superior court denied summary judgment on Count 3, on the ground that a genuine dispute remained as to whether FMB had induced the Additional Guaranty through fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1991, after FMB had been placed in receivership, FDIC removed the action to federal district court, then moved for summary judgment on Count 3 and on the remaining Bay Street and Ryan counterclaims.  Ryan and Bay Street countered with a motion for reconsideration of the superior court's summary judgment rulings on Counts 1 and 2.  In due course, the district court granted summary judgment for FDIC on Count 3 and on defendants' counterclaims, and denied the motion for reconsideration on Counts 1 and 2.  This appeal ensued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A.

As with any summary judgment order, id., we review the district court ruling de novo, employing the identical summary judgment criteria incumbent upon the court below, Velez-Gomez, 8 F.3d at 874-75.   Thus, summary judgment will be upheld if the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, discloses no trialworthy issue of material fact, and the moving party has demonstrated its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.

Bay Street and Ryan argue that the following language in the Additional Guaranty was ambiguous, viz., \"Ryan ... to induce [FMB] to make further loan advances pursuant to the loan agreement referred to below ... hereby unconditionally guarantees ... $6,500,000.\"   Based on Ryan's affidavit attesting to the Arnone meeting, see supra p. 638, Bay Street and Ryan argue that a jury reasonably could find that the above-quoted language represented a commitment by FMB to advance the entire undisbursed balance ($4.5 million) it originally agreed to lend under the Loan Agreement, without regard to past or future defaults by Bay Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Their defense is not sustainable against FDIC, see D'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. v.

Two Rivers Assocs., Inc., 880 F.2d 1267, 1275-76 (11th Cir.1989) (on similar facts, inquiring whether writings contained explicit acceptance of the obligation to fund the entire project).  The only writing arguably evidencing an ambiguous commitment of this type is the Additional Guaranty itself, which merely states that Ryan provided the Additional Guaranty \"to induce FMB to make further loan advances.\"   Bay Street and Ryan implicitly concede as much by maintaining that \"the meaning and import of the [quoted] phrase is not clear from the face of the document drawn by [FMB] in which it appears, or from any other document referred to therein.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent extrinsic evidence, the Additional Guaranty cannot be read to require FMB to advance all loan funds remaining undisbursed under the Loan Agreement.  See Sweeney v. RTC, 16 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1994) (per curiam ) (contract terms were \"far too ambiguous, absent extraneous support, to establish an agreement to fund further construction.  At most, they reflect an intention to provide further funds.\")  (footnote omitted), petition for cert. filed, 62 U.S.L.W. 3775 (U.S. May 2, 1994) (No. 93-1782);  see also FDIC v. Hamilton, 939 F.2d 1225, 1231 (5th Cir.1991) (the Sec. 1823(e) mandate--that promises be \"in writing\"--only permits enforcement of obligations set out on the face of the instrument).  And, of course, extrinsic evidence of additional terms is inadmissible against FDIC.  See Two Rivers, 880 F.2d at 1276 (\"[O]ne ambiguous reference to a further construction loan is not sufficient to allow [defendant] to advance defenses against the FSLIC about an agreement to fund the entire project.\");  RTC v. Daddona, 9 F.3d 312, 319 (3d Cir.1993) (\"[T]he essential terms ...

See Howell v. Continental Credit Corp., 655 F.2d 743, 746-47 (7th Cir.1981) (D'Oench inapplicable where face of instrument whose terms FDIC seeks to enforce manifests bilateral obligations that form the basis of the opposing party's defense).

See supra pp. 638, 639.  Thus, reliance on the so-called Howell exception is misplaced.  See FDIC v. O'Neil, 809 F.2d 350, 354 (7th Cir.1987) (Howell exception inapplicable where bank's obligation did not appear explicitly on face of document FDIC sought to enforce);  accord Hamilton, 939 F.2d at 1231 (Howell exception inapplicable as face of note did not manifest bilateral obligations);  Two Rivers, 880 F.2d at 1275 (\"This is not a case like [Howell ] where the leases on which the suit was based 'clearly manifest[ed] the bilateral nature of the lessee's and lessor's rights and obligations.' \").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative policy underlying the D'Oench doctrine corroborates the district court ruling as well.  A primary aim of D'Oench is to enable bank examiners to rely on bank records in assessing the value of bank assets.  See Langley v. FDIC, 484 U.S. 86, 91, 108 S.Ct. 396, 401, 98 L.Ed.2d 340 (1987).

James Talcott, Inc., 358 Mass. 180, 260 N.E.2d 903, 910 (1970) (\"[A] substantial change in the conditions to which a bond relates, made without the knowledge and consent of the surety, discharges him from further liability.\")  (applying Mass. law;  citations omitted);  FDIC v. Manion, 712 F.2d 295, 297 (7th Cir.1983) (noting general acceptance of this rule).  Their resourceful theory is that the Indemnification Agreement, as a practical matter, effectively insulated them from risk under the Multiple Guaranty, see supra p. 638, because Ryan's net worth, approximating $5.7 million at the time the Indemnification Agreement was executed, provided ample wherewithal to fund Ryan's commitment to indemnify them for any liability incurred under the Multiple Guaranty.  But because the Additional Guaranty increased the total exposure on Ryan's personal guaranties to $9 million (the $2.5 million Multiple Guaranty plus the $6.5 million Additional Guaranty), well beyond his total net worth, Byrne and Timilty insist that their actual exposure on the Multiple Guaranty was thereby increased from zero to $2.5 million.  Thus, they argue, FMB materially modified the Multiple Guaranty to their detriment by obtaining the Additional Guaranty from Ryan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with this appealing argument is that it is premised on a revisionist view of the Indemnification Agreement;  hence, it too is precluded under the D'Oench, Duhme doctrine, due to the absence of any FMB record substantiating an obligation on the part of FMB to refrain from undermining the Multiple Guaranty in this manner.  Further, even Byrne and Timilty make no claim that either Ryan or FMB was under any contractual or other legal obligation to refrain from increasing Ryan's liability to FMB or to obtain the approval of Byrne and Timilty before doing so.

Bay Street's claims on appeal track Ryan's, save that Bay Street also asserts that the district court erred in finding no trialworthy issue relating to Bay Street's state-law counterclaims charging bad faith and unfair dealing.  These latter claims are deemed waived, as they are unsupported by any developed argumentation.  See, e.g., RTC v.

The Loan Agreement set the maximum loan principal at $9 million, with disbursements to be made over time subject to certain conditions specified in the Loan Agreement.  Contemporaneously, the Bay Street principals, defendants-appellants John Ryan,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> William J. Byrne and Joseph F. Timilty, jointly and severally guarantied the construction loan to the extent of $2.5 million (the Multiple Guaranty).  Pursuant to a written side agreement, Ryan promised to indemnify Byrne and Timilty for any liability incurred under the Multiple Guaranty (the Indemnification Agreement).  At the time the Indemnification Agreement was executed, Ryan had a net worth of $5.7 million.  FMB's records contain no reference to the Indemnification Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1987, Bay Street failed to satisfy certain conditions which constituted default events under the Loan Agreement.  Bay Street attempted to negotiate with FMB to cure the defaults.  Finally, at a meeting on February 6, 1989 (the Arnone meeting), FMB vice-president Richard Arnone informed Ryan that FMB would release the undisbursed balance of the $9 million construction loan, notwithstanding any past or future Bay Street defaults, if Ryan would provide FMB with an additional guaranty (the Additional Guaranty).  On February 23, Ryan executed the Additional Guaranty, which expressly stated that he was guarantying an additional $6.5 million in order \"to induce [FMB] to make further loan advances pursuant to the [L]oan [A]greement.\"  (emphasis added).  FMB thereupon advanced Bay Street another $1.5 million, bringing total advances under the Loan Agreement to $6 million.  By May 1989, Bay Street had yet to cure its previous defaults under the Loan Agreement.  At about the same time, Ryan notified FMB that he was repudiating both the Multiple Guaranty and the Additional Guaranty.  As Ryan and Bay Street were in default, FMB demanded payment in full pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement and the loan guaranties.  The defendants rejected FMB's demand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1989, FMB initiated the present action in Massachusetts Superior Court against Bay Street for breach of the Loan Agreement (Count 1);  Ryan, Byrne and Timilty for breach of the Multiple Guaranty (Count 2);  and Ryan for breach of the Additional Guaranty (Count 3).  Bay Street and Ryan filed counterclaims for, inter alia, fraud in the inducement and breach of the Arnone meeting agreement.  In April 1990, the superior court granted summary judgment for FMB on Counts 1 and 2, rejecting the defense interposed by Byrne and Timilty that FMB had released them from the Multiple Guaranty by accepting the Additional Guaranty, which effected an unauthorized alteration of the Loan Agreement.  The superior court denied summary judgment on Count 3, on the ground that a genuine dispute remained as to whether FMB had induced the Additional Guaranty through fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1991, after FMB had been placed in receivership, FDIC removed the action to federal district court, then moved for summary judgment on Count 3 and on the remaining Bay Street and Ryan counterclaims.  Ryan and Bay Street countered with a motion for reconsideration of the superior court's summary judgment rulings on Counts 1 and 2.  In due course, the district court granted summary judgment for FDIC on Count 3 and on defendants' counterclaims, and denied the motion for reconsideration on Counts 1 and 2.  This appeal ensued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A.

Bay Street and Ryan argue that the following language in the Additional Guaranty was ambiguous, viz., \"Ryan ... to induce [FMB] to make further loan advances pursuant to the loan agreement referred to below ... hereby unconditionally guarantees ... $6,500,000.\"   Based on Ryan's affidavit attesting to the Arnone meeting, see supra p. 638, Bay Street and Ryan argue that a jury reasonably could find that the above-quoted language represented a commitment by FMB to advance the entire undisbursed balance ($4.5 million) it originally agreed to lend under the Loan Agreement, without regard to past or future defaults by Bay Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Their defense is not sustainable against FDIC, see D'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. v.

The only writing arguably evidencing an ambiguous commitment of this type is the Additional Guaranty itself, which merely states that Ryan provided the Additional Guaranty \"to induce FMB to make further loan advances.\"   Bay Street and Ryan implicitly concede as much by maintaining that \"the meaning and import of the [quoted] phrase is not clear from the face of the document drawn by [FMB] in which it appears, or from any other document referred to therein.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent extrinsic evidence, the Additional Guaranty cannot be read to require FMB to advance all loan funds remaining undisbursed under the Loan Agreement.

Their resourceful theory is that the Indemnification Agreement, as a practical matter, effectively insulated them from risk under the Multiple Guaranty, see supra p. 638, because Ryan's net worth, approximating $5.7 million at the time the Indemnification Agreement was executed, provided ample wherewithal to fund Ryan's commitment to indemnify them for any liability incurred under the Multiple Guaranty.  But because the Additional Guaranty increased the total exposure on Ryan's personal guaranties to $9 million (the $2.5 million Multiple Guaranty plus the $6.5 million Additional Guaranty), well beyond his total net worth, Byrne and Timilty insist that their actual exposure on the Multiple Guaranty was thereby increased from zero to $2.5 million.  Thus, they argue, FMB materially modified the Multiple Guaranty to their detriment by obtaining the Additional Guaranty from Ryan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with this appealing argument is that it is premised on a revisionist view of the Indemnification Agreement;  hence, it too is precluded under the D'Oench, Duhme doctrine, due to the absence of any FMB record substantiating an obligation on the part of FMB to refrain from undermining the Multiple Guaranty in this manner.  Further, even Byrne and Timilty make no claim that either Ryan or FMB was under any contractual or other legal obligation to refrain from increasing Ryan's liability to FMB or to obtain the approval of Byrne and Timilty before doing so.

Byrne and Timilty challenge the rejection of their defense to the Multiple Guaranty.  Bay Street's claims on appeal track Ryan's, save that Bay Street also asserts that the district court erred in finding no trialworthy issue relating to Bay Street's state-law counterclaims charging bad faith and unfair dealing.  These latter claims are deemed waived, as they are unsupported by any developed argumentation.  See, e.g., RTC v.

The Additional Guaranty expressly provides that \"[u]pon the occurrence of any event of Default (as that term is defined in the Loan Agreement ) in the payment or performance of any of [Bay Street's] obligations, [Ryan's] obligations and liabilities hereunder shall become immediately due.\"  (emphasis added).
