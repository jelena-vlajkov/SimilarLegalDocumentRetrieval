PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n                                          \n\n          Appellants filed an initial  complaint on July 23,\n\n1993, in United  States District  Court in  the District  of\n\nMassachusetts,  followed  by an  amended complaint  filed on\n\nAugust  20,  1993.    The  amended   complaint  (hereinafter\n\n\"Complaint\") was filed on  behalf of 1000 plaintiffs against\n\n93 defendants with  the first twenty pages  listing only the\n\nnames and social security numbers of plaintiffs, followed by\n\ntwo  pages  listing the  names  only  of  defendants.    The\n\nremaining  four  and  one-half  pages  encompass Appellants'\n\nbasic claims and allege, in summation, the following:\n\n                            -3-\n\n          (a)  paragraphs 1 and 2 allege that\n               the  action  is brought  under\n               Fed. R. Civ.  P. 20  governing\n               joinder of parties  and is  an\n               admiralty and  maritime action\n               within the meaning of  Fed. R.\n               Civ. P. 9(h); \n\n          (b)  paragraph   4   alleges   that\n               defendants           designed,\n               manufactured,    or   supplied\n               asbestos     and     asbestos-\n               containing     products     or\n               machinery  for   placement  on\n               vessels upon  which plaintiffs\n               or    plaintiffs'    decedents\n               served as crewmembers; \n\n          (c)  paragraph 5 alleges that  as a\n               direct and proximate result of\n               exposure  to   such  products,\n               plaintiffs    have    suffered\n               asbestos-related diseases; \n\n          (d)  paragraph 6  alleges that each\n               defendant negligently designed\n               and      manufactured     such\n               products, failed to adequately\n               warn  of  the hazards  of such\n               products,   and  committed   a\n               breach of  implied warranty of\n               fitness   of  the   respective\n               products  for  their  intended\n               use;\n\n          (e)  paragraph   7   alleges   that\n               defendants committed acts  and\n               omissions constituting willful\n               and  wanton disregard  for the\n               safety of those  who would  be\n               exposed to  their products and\n               should be  subject to punitive\n               damages;\n\n          (f)  paragraph  8 alleges  that due\n               to      defendants'      acts,\n\n                            -4-\n\n               plaintiffs    have   sustained\n               damages   including  loss   of\n               earnings and earning capacity,\n               pain and suffering,  exemplary\n               and punitive damages, and loss\n               of   support,    society   and\n               companionship.\n\nSee Complaint (Docket No. 83) at 21-25. \n   \n\n          From the  time the  Complaint was filed  until its\n\ndismissal  on   January  5,  1994,   over  twenty  Appellee-\n\ndefendants filed motions to dismiss and motions for issuance\n\nof a show cause  order.  These motions, to  which Appellants\n\nnever  responded, challenged  the Complaint  on a  number of\n\ngrounds, including  failure  to provide  sufficient  factual\n\ninformation to  put defendants on  notice of the  claims and\n\nimproper joinder.  \n\n          On September  24, 1993, the trial  judge issued an\n\norder directing  Appellants' counsel  to show cause  why the\n\naction should proceed.   The order stated that the Complaint\n\npresents  \"serious   questions   regarding  not   only   the\n\njurisdiction of  this Court but  whether this Court  has any\n\nconnection  with  the  claims  and whether  there  has  been\n\ncompliance  with  the  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure.\"\n\nOrder  to Show  Cause  (Docket No. 124)  at  1.   The  order\n\nindicated  that Appellants' counsel should appear before the\n\ncourt on October 27, 1993, and present the factual and legal\n\n                            -5-\n\nbasis for, inter alia,  the contention that the  parties are\n                     \n\nproperly joined pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 20.  Id. at 2.\n                                                    \n\n          At  the   show-cause  hearing,  the   trial  judge\n\nindicated that she was \"very disturbed about the joinder  of\n\n1000 plaintiffs  and 93 defendants without  any statement of\n\nfact about how they belong together in a case of this sort.\"\n\nHearing Transcript (Tr.)(October 27, 1993) at 141.  She also\n\nindicated  her  concern  that  a  number  of  issues  to  be\n\nlitigated -- such as identification of the products to which\n\neach  plaintiff was exposed, causation, and damages -- would\n\ninvolve  individual  determinations  with  respect  to  each\n\nplaintiff, militating against joinder.  Id. at 8-10.  \n                                           \n\n          The court further indicated that the Complaint had\n\nnot  been filed  in  accordance with  Local Rules  governing\n\njoinder  and  specificity of pleading  in asbestos cases set\n\nout  in Massachusetts  Multiple  Litigation Orders  3 and  4\n\n(\"MML Orders 3 and  4).1  See In re:  Massachusetts Asbestos\n                                                            \n\n                    \n\n     1MML Orders 3 and 4 place limits on joinder and require\ncomplaints to  indicate, to the extent  possible, \"the dates\nof  alleged exposure,\" \"the  names of  plaintiffs' employers\nand  the  dates  of   employment  where  such  exposure  has\noccurred.\"  MML Order 3 at VIII (2).  MML Orders 3 and 4 are\napplicable  to all asbestos  cases filed in  the District of\nMassachusetts \"except  as otherwise  directed  by the  Court\nupon motion and for cause shown by the party seeking to have\n[the  Orders] declared inapplicable.\"  MML Orders 3 and 4 at\nII.\n\n                            -6-\n\nCases,  Pretrial  Order No.  3, (June  3,  1981) and  In re:\n                                                            \n\nMassachusetts   Asbestos  Cases,   Pretrial  Order   No.  4,\n                               \n\n(December  14, 1984).   Appellants'  counsel told  the court\n\nthat the case was in the process of being transferred by the\n\nJudicial  Panel on  Multidistrict Litigation  (\"MDL Panel\")2\n\nand  stated that  \"this  court and  all federal  courts with\n\nregard to the asbestos litigation, is a conduit court.\"  Tr.\n\nat 23.  Counsel further indicated that he was subject to MDL\n\nrules  only and  not  the Local  Rules  of the  District  of\n           \n\nMassachusetts, stating that:\n\n               I am saying that this  is MDL.\n               This is not  Local Rules.   We\n               are not bound by  Local Rules,\n               and  you  should not  perceive\n               this.  MDL states specifically\n               that  you  don't even  have to\n               plead anything,  just a few --\n                just a few sparse paragraphs,\n\n                    \n\n     2In re:   Asbestos  Products Liability Litigation,  771\n                                                      \nF.

You  do not have to\n               go into detail, and the detail\n               counsel suggests is unheard of\n               anywhere, and we are not bound\n               by  your  Local   Rules.     I\n               wouldn't come here to be bound\n               by your Local Rules.  \n\n               We  understand  that  here  in\n               this  jurisdiction,   when  in\n               this  jurisdiction,  that  the\n               cases  stood  here, and  stood\n               here for many, many years, and\n               nothing happened to it.   So I\n               certainly  wouldn't  come here\n               to  be  bound  by  your  Local\n               Rules . . . And so I am saying\n               to you, your Honor,  these are\n               MDL cases.  They  don't belong\n               here.    This  is   a  conduit\n               court.   We  are not  bound by\n               your  Local Rules  with regard\n               to pretrials or anything else,\n               and  that  everything  that  I\n               have  indicated  to  you  with\n               respect  to  the propriety  of\n               the filing, I stand on.\n\nTr. at 40-41.  \n\n          After hearing  from Appellees' counsel,  the court\n\ndetermined  that plaintiffs  and defendants  were improperly\n\njoined in the Complaint, that the Complaint failed to allege\n\na factual  basis for the court's  exercise of subject-matter\n\nand personal  jurisdiction, and failed to  comply with Local\n\nRules, MML  Orders  3 and  4, which  require that  asbestos-\n\nrelated complaints  recite minimal facts  and be filed  in a\n\nparticular form.  Id. at 42-43.  The  court then ordered the\n                     \n\n                            -8-\n\nComplaint to be \"dismissed without prejudice to the refiling\n                                  \n\nof separate complaints on behalf of each plaintiff (emphasis\n\nadded)\"  correcting   the  deficiencies  noted   during  the\n\nhearing.  Id. at 43.     \n             \n\n          Appellants'   counsel    objected   to   immediate\n\ndismissal, indicating that an unknown number  of plaintiffs'\n\nclaims might  be barred by relevant  statutes of limitation.\n\nThe  court then asked counsel how much time he would need to\n\nrefile individual complaints in compliance with Local Rules,\n\nand counsel responded,  \"Well, we are  very busy, but  sixty\n\ndays.\"  Id. at  44.  Appellees' counsel then  requested that\n           \n\nif  the  court  was planning  to  set  a  specific date  for\n\nrefiling, dismissal  for failure to adhere  to that deadline\n\nshould be with prejudice and on the merits, explaining that:\n\n               to   the   extent   that   new\n               complaints  are  not filed  on\n               behalf  of the  plaintiffs who\n               came in to  Court here, and as\n               to  whom  I forbore  on asking\n               for Rule 11 sanctions, I think\n               the appropriate requirement to\n               put  on this is  that if there\n               is   no  refiling,   that  the\n               dismissals that result be with\n               prejudice  and  on the  merits\n               for   the    reason   that   a\n               representation has  been made,\n               and then no action pursuant to\n               your  order  is  taken, and  I\n               think that  the dismissal with\n               prejudice and on the merits is\n\n                            -9-\n\n               a  fair fall  out of  that, of\n               that circumstance.\n\nId. at 45.  \n   \n\n          The  court indicated  its agreement,  stating that\n\nsince Appellants'  counsel has  \"chosen to file  an improper\n\n[Complaint] on behalf of  1000 plaintiffs,\" he now  has \"the\n\noption  of filing proper Complaints on behalf of each one of\n\nthe  1000 plaintiffs.  To the extent that [he] choose[s] not\n\nto file on behalf  of anyone of these named  plaintiffs, any\n\nclaim by  the plaintiff . . . will  be dismissed in  60 days\n\nwith  prejudice.\"  Id.  at 46.   The court then  amended its\n                      \n\norder to read as follows:\n\n               The   order   is   that   this\n               Complaint will be dismissed in\n               sixty  days  from  this  date.\n               Without prejudice with respect\n               to   any  plaintiff   who  has\n               refiled   a   Complaint   that\n               accords  with pretrial  orders\n               numbers three and four, and to\n               the  extent  that it  seeks to\n               invoke       the      maritime\n               jurisdiction,        admiralty\n               jurisdiction  of  this  Court,\n               that it also sets  forth facts\n               that  support  that.   To  the\n               extent that any plaintiff does\n               not  refile, that  plaintiff's\n               claim   is   dismissed    with\n               prejudice, and  your objection\n               is noted.  You have a right to\n               appeal from this order.\n\nId. at 47 (\"October Order\").\n   \n\n                            -10-\n\n          Appellants' counsel did not file new complaints on\n\nbehalf of any plaintiff.   Two days before the  deadline set\n\nin the October Order, he filed  a motion \"to extend time  an\n\nadditional  sixty  (60)  days   to  evaluate  legal  options\n\npertaining to this cause.\"   Docket No. 183 (Dec. 23, 1993).\n\nThe judge  dismissed the motion,  finding that  it had  been\n\nimproperly filed because counsel  failed to make and certify\n\nservice   on  opposing   counsel  pursuant  to   Local  Rule\n\n5.2(B)(2).   Docket No. 183-1 (Jan. 5, 1994).  Following two\n\nrequests  for  dismissal  filed by  Appellees'  counsel  for\n\nfailure  to adhere to  the court's October  Order, the judge\n\nentered   the   following   order   dismissing   Appellants'\n\nComplaint:\n\n               IT  IS  ORDERED AND  ADJUDGED,\n               After a hearing on the Court's\n               Order  to  Show Cause,  and in\n               light  of plaintiffs'  failure\n               to  refile  1,000   individual\n               complaints  within sixty  days\n               in accordance with the Court's\n               Order  of  October  27,  1993,\n               plaintiffs'     claims     are\n               dismissed with  prejudice, and\n               judgment   shall   enter   for\n               defendants.\n\nDocket No. 185 (Jan. 5, 1994)(\"January Order\").\n\n                            -11-\n\n                      II.  DISCUSSION\n                                     \n\n          Appellants  challenge  the  court's  dismissal  of\n\ntheir  Complaint with  prejudice on  several grounds.   They\n\nargue primarily  that the  dismissal of their  Complaint was\n\nbased on a finding of improper joinder and that Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 21  unequivocally states \"[m]isjoinder of  parties is not\n\nground  for dismissal  of an  action.\"3   Furthermore, given\n\nthe  explicit  wording of  Rule  21,  Appellants argue  that\n\ndismissal with prejudice on the grounds of misjoinder was an\n\nabuse of discretion.4  \n\n                    \n\n     3Rule 21 states that:\n\n               Misjoinder  of parties  is not\n               ground  for  dismissal  of  an\n               action.      Parties  may   be\n               dropped or added  by order  of\n               the  court  on  motion of  any\n               party or on its own initiative\n               at any stage of the action and\n               on  such  terms  as are  just.\n               Any claim against a  party may\n               be severed  and proceeded with\n               separately.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 21.\n\n     4Appellants  also  allege  that Massachusetts  Multiple\nLitigation  Orders  3  and 4  (\"MML  Orders  3  and 4\")  are\ninconsistent  with Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 20  and 8(a)  governing\njoinder  and pleading  requirements and  should be  declared\ninvalid.    However,  Appellants  failed  to  challenge  the\nsubstance of  these rules  to the  court  below, other  than\nerroneously  asserting  that Local  Rules  do  not apply  to\nasbestos-related cases (see n. 7, infra), nor did they avail\n                                       \n\n                            -12-\n\n          We   reject  Appellants'  attempt  to  reduce  the\n\ngrounds  for the January Order to the misjoinder issue only.\n\nWe note in passing, however,  our agreement with the court's\n\ndetermination  that  the  Complaint failed  to  satisfy  the\n\nprerequisites for joinder  pursuant to Fed. R.  Civ. P. 20.5\n\n                    \n\nthemselves  of the provisions in MML Orders 3 and 4 allowing\nthem to show good cause as to why the Local Rules should not\napply to their action.  Hence, they have waived these issues\non appeal.  \n\n     5Appellants' Complaint  fails to satisfy  the threshold\nrequirement of Fed.R. Civ. P.  20 that the plaintiffs' claim\nfor relief  arise out of \"the  same transaction, occurrence,\nor series of transactions or occurrences.\"  The Complaint is\nbereft of factual allegations indicating why 1000 plaintiffs\nand 93 defendants belong  in the same action.   It gives  no\nindication of whether plaintiffs were  injured while serving\non  the same  vessels or  during the  same time  periods; no\nindication of  whether they were injured by  exposure to the\nsame  asbestos-containing  products  or equipment,  nor  any\nspecification  of the  products or  equipment to  which they\nwere exposed.\n\n          This Court notes that Appellants' counsel has been\nunsuccessful in his attempts to file nearly identical claims\nin  other United States District Courts.  With regard to the\njoinder issue, a court in the District of Maryland wrote:\n\n               It is plain to this Court that\n               the 1,000  plaintiffs' claims,\n               set  forth  in this  complaint\n               simply as a skeleton  claim of\n               maritime exposure to asbestos,\n               without    any    attempt   at\n               individualization           or\n               description of  the particular\n               circumstances and exposures of\n               the individual plaintiffs, let\n               alone   the  products   and/or\n               defendants  alleged  to   have\n\n                            -13-\n\nWe also note that failure to  allege a basis for joinder was\n\nonly  one of the many weaknesses identified by the court and\n                     \n\nopposing  counsel  when  faced with  this  unwieldy  action.\n\nAmong  other things,  the  Complaint failed  to comply  with\n\nLocal  Rules governing  the  filing of  asbestos claims  and\n\nfailed to  provide  a  short  and plain  statement  of  each\n\nplaintiff's claims sufficient to place defendants on  notice\n\nof  the nature of the action against them as required by the\n\nLocal Rules and Fed.

P. 8(a), we join in the reasoning of the Aaberg\n                                                            \ncourt,  which  faced  a  nearly  identical  claim  filed  by\nAppellants'  counsel.   After dismissing  all but  the named\nplaintiff  for improper  joinder,  the  court  proceeded  to\ndismiss the claim as to  the remaining plaintiff for failure\nto state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a), noting that:\n\n               This   is   not   a   pro   se\n                                             \n               complaint,  but,  rather,  one\n               filed   by  counsel,   and  it\n               involves    only    reasonable\n               expectations of  competence to\n               require  that  a complaint  at\n               least identify some or  all of\n               the voyages  undertaken by the\n               plaintiff during  which he was\n               allegedly exposed  to asbestos\n               and the specific products (and\n               manufacturers     of     those\n\n                            -14-\n\n          Rather  than dismissal for misjoinder, the January\n\nOrder is  more appropriately viewed as  a dismissal pursuant\n\nto  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  41(b) on  the grounds  that Appellants\n\nfailed to comply  with the October  Order, the Local  Rules,\n\nand  the  Federal Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.   Rule  41(b)\n\nprovides in relevant part as follows:\n\n               Involuntary Dismissal:  Effect\n               Thereof.

Unless  the\n               court   in   its   order   for\n               dismissal otherwise specifies,\n               a    dismissal   under    this\n               subdivision and  any dismissal\n               not provided for in this rule,\n               other  than  a  dismissal  for\n               lack   of  jurisdiction,   for\n\n                    \n\n               products)    that,   plaintiff\n               claims,  caused  his   injury.\n               Without  these  facts  in  the\n               complaint,    defendants   are\n               helpless    to    answer    or\n               otherwise   respond    to   it\n               intelligently.     The   Court\n               recognizes    that    asbestos\n               litigation  is different  from\n               most other federal litigation,\n               but  it  still is  litigation,\n               subject to  the Federal Rules.\n               Additionally,   the  plaintiff\n               must properly plead  proximate\n               cause, injury, and damage.\n\nAaberg, 152 F.R.D. at 501.\n      \n\n                            -15-\n\n               improper venue, or for failure\n               to join a party under Rule 19,\n               operates  as  an  adjudication\n\n               upon the merits.\n\nFed.

At the time  of the  October 27\nshow-cause hearing,  Appellants' case  was the subject  of a\nconditional transfer order  issued by the  MDL Panel.   Rule\n18, of  the Rules of Procedure governing cases tranferred by\nthe MDL Panel, provides in relevant part that:\n\n               The  pendency   of  a  motion,\n               order    to     show    cause,\n               conditional transfer order  or\n                                         \n               conditional    remand    order\n               before  the  Panel  concerning\n               transfer   or  remand   of  an\n               action  pursuant to  28 U.S.C.\n                 1407  does   not  affect  or\n                                             \n               suspend  orders  and  pretrial\n                                             \n               proceedings  in  the  district\n                                             \n               court in which  the action  is\n                                             \n               pending  and  does not  in any\n                                             \n               way    limit   the    pretrial\n                                             \n               jurisdiction of that court.\n                                         \n\nRules of  Procedure of  the Judicial Panel  on Multidistrict\nLitigation, 147  F.R.D.  589, 601  (J.P.M.L.  1993)(emphasis\nadded). \n\n                            -18-\n\n               Courts   cannot   function  if\n               litigants may,  with impunity,\n               disobey lawful orders.

Because we find that the trial judge acted within her discretion in dismissing Appellants' action with prejudice pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b), we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants filed an initial complaint on July 23, 1993, in United States District Court in the District of Massachusetts, followed by an amended complaint filed on August 20, 1993.  The amended complaint (hereinafter \"Complaint\") was filed on behalf of 1000 plaintiffs against 93 defendants with the first twenty pages listing only the names and social security numbers of plaintiffs, followed by two pages listing the names only of defendants. The remaining four and one-half pages encompass Appellants' basic claims and allege, in summation, the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) paragraphs 1 and 2 allege that the action is brought under Fed.R.Civ.P. 20 governing joinder of parties and is an admiralty and maritime action within the meaning of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(h);</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) paragraph 4 alleges that defendants designed, manufactured, or supplied asbestos and asbestos-containing products or machinery for placement on vessels upon which plaintiffs or plaintiffs' decedents served as crewmembers;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) paragraph 5 alleges that as a direct and proximate result of exposure to such products, plaintiffs have suffered asbestos-related diseases;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) paragraph 6 alleges that each defendant negligently designed and manufactured such products, failed to adequately warn of the hazards of such products, and committed a breach of implied warranty of fitness of the respective products for their intended use;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(e) paragraph 7 alleges that defendants committed acts and omissions constituting willful and wanton disregard for the safety of those who would be exposed to their products and should be subject to punitive damages;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(f) paragraph 8 alleges that due to defendants' acts, plaintiffs have sustained damages including loss of earnings and earning capacity, pain and suffering, exemplary and punitive damages, and loss of support, society and companionship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Complaint (Docket No. 83) at 21-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the time the Complaint was filed until its dismissal on January 5, 1994, over twenty Appellee-defendants filed motions to dismiss and motions for issuance of a show cause order.  These motions, to which Appellants never responded, challenged the Complaint on a number of grounds, including failure to provide sufficient factual information to put defendants on notice of the claims and improper joinder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 24, 1993, the trial judge issued an order directing Appellants' counsel to show cause why the action should proceed.  The order stated that the Complaint presents \"serious questions regarding not only the jurisdiction of this Court but whether this Court has any connection with the claims and whether there has been compliance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\"   Order to Show Cause (Docket No. 124) at 1.  The order indicated that Appellants' counsel should appear before the court on October 27, 1993, and present the factual and legal basis for, inter alia, the contention that the parties are properly joined pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 20.  Id. at 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the show-cause hearing, the trial judge indicated that she was \"very disturbed about the joinder of 1000 plaintiffs and 93 defendants without any statement of fact about how they belong together in a case of this sort.\"   Hearing Transcript (Tr.)  (October 27, 1993) at 141.  She also indicated her concern that a number of issues to be litigated--such as identification of the products to which each plaintiff was exposed, causation, and damages--would involve individual determinations with respect to each plaintiff, militating against joinder.  Id. at 8-10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court further indicated that the Complaint had not been filed in accordance with Local Rules governing joinder and specificity of pleading in asbestos cases set out in Massachusetts Multiple Litigation Orders 3 and 4 (\"MML Orders 3 and 4\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See In re:  Massachusetts Asbestos Cases, Pretrial Order No. 3, (June 3, 1981) and In re:  Massachusetts Asbestos Cases, Pretrial Order No. 4, (December 14, 1984).  Appellants' counsel told the court that the case was in the process of being transferred by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (\"MDL Panel\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and stated that \"this court and all federal courts with regard to the asbestos litigation, is a conduit court.\"   Tr. at 23.  Counsel further indicated that he was subject to MDL rules only and not the Local Rules of the District of Massachusetts, stating that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>I am saying that this is MDL.  This is not Local Rules.  We are not bound by Local Rules, and you should not perceive this.  MDL states specifically that you don't even have to plead anything, just a few--just a few sparse paragraphs, and that's all that's required.  You do not have to go into detail, and the detail counsel suggests is unheard of anywhere, and we are not bound by your Local Rules.  I wouldn't come here to be bound by your Local Rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>We understand that here in this jurisdiction, when in this jurisdiction, that the cases stood here, and stood here for many, many years, and nothing happened to it.  So I certainly wouldn't come here to be bound by your Local Rules ...  And so I am saying to you, your Honor, these are MDL cases.  They don't belong here.  This is a conduit court.  We are not bound by your Local Rules with regard to pretrials or anything else, and that everything that I have indicated to you with respect to the propriety of the filing, I stand on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 40-41.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After hearing from Appellees' counsel, the court determined that plaintiffs and defendants were improperly joined in the Complaint, that the Complaint failed to allege a factual basis for the court's exercise of subject-matter and personal jurisdiction, and failed to comply with Local Rules, MML Orders 3 and 4, which require that asbestos-related complaints recite minimal facts and be filed in a particular form.  Id. at 42-43.  The court then ordered the Complaint to be \"dismissed without prejudice to the refiling of separate complaints on behalf of each plaintiff (emphasis added)\" correcting the deficiencies noted during the hearing.  Id. at 43.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' counsel objected to immediate dismissal, indicating that an unknown number of plaintiffs' claims might be barred by relevant statutes of limitation.  The court then asked counsel how much time he would need to refile individual complaints in compliance with Local Rules, and counsel responded, \"Well, we are very busy, but sixty days.\"   Id. at 44.  Appellees' counsel then requested that if the court was planning to set a specific date for refiling, dismissal for failure to adhere to that deadline should be with prejudice and on the merits, explaining that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>to the extent that new complaints are not filed on behalf of the plaintiffs who came in to Court here, and as to whom I forbore on asking for Rule 11 sanctions, I think the appropriate requirement to put on this is that if there is no refiling, that the dismissals that result be with prejudice and on the merits for the reason that a representation has been made, and then no action pursuant to your order is taken, and I think that the dismissal with prejudice and on the merits is a fair fall out of that, of that circumstance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 45.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court indicated its agreement, stating that since Appellants' counsel has \"chosen to file an improper [Complaint] on behalf of 1000 plaintiffs,\" he now has \"the option of filing proper Complaints on behalf of each one of the 1000 plaintiffs.  To the extent that [he] choose[s] not to file on behalf of anyone of these named plaintiffs, any claim by the plaintiff ... will be dismissed in 60 days with prejudice.\"   Id. at 46.  The court then amended its order to read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>The order is that this Complaint will be dismissed in sixty days from this date.  Without prejudice with respect to any plaintiff who has refiled a Complaint that accords with pretrial orders numbers three and four, and to the extent that it seeks to invoke the maritime jurisdiction, admiralty jurisdiction of this Court, that it also sets forth facts that support that.  To the extent that any plaintiff does not refile, that plaintiff's claim is dismissed with prejudice, and your objection is noted.  You have a right to appeal from this order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 47 (\"October Order\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' counsel did not file new complaints on behalf of any plaintiff.  Two days before the deadline set in the October Order, he filed a motion \"to extend time an additional sixty (60) days to evaluate legal options pertaining to this cause.\"   Docket No. 183 (Dec. 23, 1993).  The judge dismissed the motion, finding that it had been improperly filed because counsel failed to make and certify service on opposing counsel pursuant to Local Rule 5.2(B)(2).  Docket No. 183-1 (Jan. 5, 1994).  Following two requests for dismissal filed by Appellees' counsel for failure to adhere to the court's October Order, the judge entered the following order dismissing Appellants' Complaint:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>IT IS ORDERED AND ADJUDGED, After a hearing on the Court's Order to Show Cause, and in light of plaintiffs' failure to refile 1,000 individual complaints within sixty days in accordance with the Court's Order of October 27, 1993, plaintiffs' claims are dismissed with prejudice, and judgment shall enter for defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Docket No. 185 (Jan. 5, 1994) (\"January Order\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants challenge the court's dismissal of their Complaint with prejudice on several grounds.  They argue primarily that the dismissal of their Complaint was based on a finding of improper joinder and that Fed.R.Civ.P. 21 unequivocally states \"[m]isjoinder of parties is not ground for dismissal of an action.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Furthermore, given the explicit wording of Rule 21, Appellants argue that dismissal with prejudice on the grounds of misjoinder was an abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Appellants' attempt to reduce the grounds for the January Order to the misjoinder issue only.  We note in passing, however, our agreement with the court's determination that the Complaint failed to satisfy the prerequisites for joinder pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 20.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We also note that failure to allege a basis for joinder was only one of the many weaknesses identified by the court and opposing counsel when faced with this unwieldy action.  Among other things, the Complaint failed to comply with Local Rules governing the filing of asbestos claims and failed to provide a short and plain statement of each plaintiff's claims sufficient to place defendants on notice of the nature of the action against them as required by the Local Rules and Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than dismissal for misjoinder, the January Order is more appropriately viewed as a dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) on the grounds that Appellants failed to comply with the October Order, the Local Rules, and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Rule 41(b) provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>Involuntary Dismissal:  Effect Thereof.   For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court, a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against the defendant.  Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication upon the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's \"choice of remedy under Rule 41(b) is reviewable only for abuse of discretion.\"  Figueroa Ruiz v. Alegria, 896 F.2d 645, 647 (1st Cir.1990).  Under this standard, we have affirmed dismissal with prejudice in circumstances much like those presented here.  In Figueroa Ruiz, for example, we affirmed dismissal of an action with prejudice where plaintiffs filed a deficient complaint, failed to respond to motions to dismiss, and failed to comply with a court order calling for explication of factual underpinnings of various RICO claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court has made clear that a district court's choice of sanctions for failure to comply with a court order or the Federal Rules will not be lightly disturbed upon appeal.

Parque Industrial Rio Canas, Inc., 847 F.2d 908, 918 (1st Cir.1988) (\"where a non-compliant litigant has manifested a disregard for orders of the court and been suitably forewarned of the consequences of continued intransigence, a trial judge need not first exhaust milder sanctions before resorting to dismissal [with prejudice]\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the court entered the January Order of dismissal in this case, it was faced with a deficient Complaint that Appellants had refused to remedy despite a court order to do so.  The October Order was issued after Appellants' counsel had objected to a tentative order dismissing the Complaint without prejudice.  Not only did Appellants' counsel make no effort to comply with the October Order, but he made no attempt to object to that Order by filing a motion for reconsideration showing good cause why it should be vacated or amended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court was also confronted with an attorney who erroneously insisted that he was not bound by Local Rules and that federal courts are mere conduits for the transfer of asbestos-related cases by the MDL Panel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Counsel's disregard of Local Rules was further reflected by his filing of a motion for extension of time without making and certifying service on opposing counsel.  In addition, during the four to five months that the action was pending, Appellants never responded to some twenty motions to dismiss filed by individual Appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">We have earlier noted that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>Courts cannot function if litigants may, with impunity, disobey lawful orders.

Though a federal court may dismiss claims sua sponte for proper cause, id., at 630-31 [82 S.Ct. at 1388-89], that inherent power has been augmented [by Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) ].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HMG Property Investors, Inc., 847 F.2d at 916.   Faced with an unmanageable Complaint, the court issued an order that would have enabled Appellants' claims to go forward in a form in which settlement or trial of meritorious claims would have been possible.  Counsel failed to comply with this order, defied Local Rules, and neglected to respond to motions filed by opposing counsel.  The record indicates that counsel's behavior was extreme, \"of a deliberate rather than inadvertent nature,\" Figueroa Ruiz, 896 F.2d at 648, and could \"reasonably be construed as an indication of 'plaintiffs' lack of interest in vindicating whatever rights they might have had.' \".  Id. (citing Zavala Santiago v. Gonzalez Rivera, 553 F.2d 710, 712 (1st Cir.1977)).

Without these facts in the complaint, defendants are helpless to answer or otherwise respond to it intelligently.  The Court recognizes that asbestos litigation is different from most other federal litigation, but it still is litigation, subject to the Federal Rules.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants filed an initial complaint on July 23, 1993, in United States District Court in the District of Massachusetts, followed by an amended complaint filed on August 20, 1993.  The amended complaint (hereinafter \"Complaint\") was filed on behalf of 1000 plaintiffs against 93 defendants with the first twenty pages listing only the names and social security numbers of plaintiffs, followed by two pages listing the names only of defendants. The remaining four and one-half pages encompass Appellants' basic claims and allege, in summation, the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) paragraphs 1 and 2 allege that the action is brought under Fed.R.Civ.P. 20 governing joinder of parties and is an admiralty and maritime action within the meaning of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(h);</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) paragraph 4 alleges that defendants designed, manufactured, or supplied asbestos and asbestos-containing products or machinery for placement on vessels upon which plaintiffs or plaintiffs' decedents served as crewmembers;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) paragraph 5 alleges that as a direct and proximate result of exposure to such products, plaintiffs have suffered asbestos-related diseases;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) paragraph 6 alleges that each defendant negligently designed and manufactured such products, failed to adequately warn of the hazards of such products, and committed a breach of implied warranty of fitness of the respective products for their intended use;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(e) paragraph 7 alleges that defendants committed acts and omissions constituting willful and wanton disregard for the safety of those who would be exposed to their products and should be subject to punitive damages;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(f) paragraph 8 alleges that due to defendants' acts, plaintiffs have sustained damages including loss of earnings and earning capacity, pain and suffering, exemplary and punitive damages, and loss of support, society and companionship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Complaint (Docket No. 83) at 21-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the time the Complaint was filed until its dismissal on January 5, 1994, over twenty Appellee-defendants filed motions to dismiss and motions for issuance of a show cause order.  These motions, to which Appellants never responded, challenged the Complaint on a number of grounds, including failure to provide sufficient factual information to put defendants on notice of the claims and improper joinder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 24, 1993, the trial judge issued an order directing Appellants' counsel to show cause why the action should proceed.  The order stated that the Complaint presents \"serious questions regarding not only the jurisdiction of this Court but whether this Court has any connection with the claims and whether there has been compliance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\"   Order to Show Cause (Docket No. 124) at 1.  The order indicated that Appellants' counsel should appear before the court on October 27, 1993, and present the factual and legal basis for, inter alia, the contention that the parties are properly joined pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 20.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 2.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the show-cause hearing, the trial judge indicated that she was \"very disturbed about the joinder of 1000 plaintiffs and 93 defendants without any statement of fact about how they belong together in a case of this sort.\"   Hearing Transcript (Tr.)  (October 27, 1993) at 141.  She also indicated her concern that a number of issues to be litigated--such as identification of the products to which each plaintiff was exposed, causation, and damages--would involve individual determinations with respect to each plaintiff, militating against joinder.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 8-10.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court further indicated that the Complaint had not been filed in accordance with Local Rules governing joinder and specificity of pleading in asbestos cases set out in Massachusetts Multiple Litigation Orders 3 and 4 (\"MML Orders 3 and 4\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See In re:  Massachusetts Asbestos Cases, Pretrial Order No. 3, (June 3, 1981) and In re:  Massachusetts Asbestos Cases, Pretrial Order No. 4, (December 14, 1984).  Appellants' counsel told the court that the case was in the process of being transferred by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (\"MDL Panel\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and stated that \"this court and all federal courts with regard to the asbestos litigation, is a conduit court.\"   Tr. at 23.  Counsel further indicated that he was subject to MDL rules only and not the Local Rules of the District of Massachusetts, stating that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>I am saying that this is MDL.  This is not Local Rules.  We are not bound by Local Rules, and you should not perceive this.  MDL states specifically that you don't even have to plead anything, just a few--just a few sparse paragraphs, and that's all that's required.  You do not have to go into detail, and the detail counsel suggests is unheard of anywhere, and we are not bound by your Local Rules.  I wouldn't come here to be bound by your Local Rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>We understand that here in this jurisdiction, when in this jurisdiction, that the cases stood here, and stood here for many, many years, and nothing happened to it.  So I certainly wouldn't come here to be bound by your Local Rules ...  And so I am saying to you, your Honor, these are MDL cases.  They don't belong here.  This is a conduit court.  We are not bound by your Local Rules with regard to pretrials or anything else, and that everything that I have indicated to you with respect to the propriety of the filing, I stand on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 40-41.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After hearing from Appellees' counsel, the court determined that plaintiffs and defendants were improperly joined in the Complaint, that the Complaint failed to allege a factual basis for the court's exercise of subject-matter and personal jurisdiction, and failed to comply with Local Rules, MML Orders 3 and 4, which require that asbestos-related complaints recite minimal facts and be filed in a particular form.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 42-43. </span> The court then ordered the Complaint to be \"dismissed without prejudice to the refiling of separate complaints on behalf of each plaintiff (emphasis added)\" correcting the deficiencies noted during the hearing.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 43.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' counsel objected to immediate dismissal, indicating that an unknown number of plaintiffs' claims might be barred by relevant statutes of limitation.  The court then asked counsel how much time he would need to refile individual complaints in compliance with Local Rules, and counsel responded, \"Well, we are very busy, but sixty days.\"   <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 44. </span> Appellees' counsel then requested that if the court was planning to set a specific date for refiling, dismissal for failure to adhere to that deadline should be with prejudice and on the merits, explaining that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>to the extent that new complaints are not filed on behalf of the plaintiffs who came in to Court here, and as to whom I forbore on asking for Rule 11 sanctions, I think the appropriate requirement to put on this is that if there is no refiling, that the dismissals that result be with prejudice and on the merits for the reason that a representation has been made, and then no action pursuant to your order is taken, and I think that the dismissal with prejudice and on the merits is a fair fall out of that, of that circumstance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 45.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court indicated its agreement, stating that since Appellants' counsel has \"chosen to file an improper [Complaint] on behalf of 1000 plaintiffs,\" he now has \"the option of filing proper Complaints on behalf of each one of the 1000 plaintiffs.  To the extent that [he] choose[s] not to file on behalf of anyone of these named plaintiffs, any claim by the plaintiff ... will be dismissed in 60 days with prejudice.\"   <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 46. </span> The court then amended its order to read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>The order is that this Complaint will be dismissed in sixty days from this date.

Two days before the deadline set in the October Order, he filed a motion \"to extend time an additional sixty (60) days to evaluate legal options pertaining to this cause.\"   Docket No. 183 (Dec. 23, 1993).  The judge dismissed the motion, finding that it had been improperly filed because counsel failed to make and certify service on opposing counsel pursuant to Local Rule 5.2(B)(2).  Docket No. 183-1 (Jan. 5, 1994).  Following two requests for dismissal filed by Appellees' counsel for failure to adhere to the court's October Order, the judge entered the following order dismissing Appellants' Complaint:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>IT IS ORDERED AND ADJUDGED, After a hearing on the Court's Order to Show Cause, and in light of plaintiffs' failure to refile 1,000 individual complaints within sixty days in accordance with the Court's Order of October 27, 1993, plaintiffs' claims are dismissed with prejudice, and judgment shall enter for defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Docket No. 185 (Jan. 5, 1994) (\"January Order\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants challenge the court's dismissal of their Complaint with prejudice on several grounds.  They argue primarily that the dismissal of their Complaint was based on a finding of improper joinder and that Fed.R.Civ.P. 21 unequivocally states \"[m]isjoinder of parties is not ground for dismissal of an action.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Furthermore, given the explicit wording of Rule 21, Appellants argue that dismissal with prejudice on the grounds of misjoinder was an abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Appellants' attempt to reduce the grounds for the January Order to the misjoinder issue only.  We note in passing, however, our agreement with the court's determination that the Complaint failed to satisfy the prerequisites for joinder pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 20.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We also note that failure to allege a basis for joinder was only one of the many weaknesses identified by the court and opposing counsel when faced with this unwieldy action.  Among other things, the Complaint failed to comply with Local Rules governing the filing of asbestos claims and failed to provide a short and plain statement of each plaintiff's claims sufficient to place defendants on notice of the nature of the action against them as required by the Local Rules and Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than dismissal for misjoinder, the January Order is more appropriately viewed as a dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) on the grounds that Appellants failed to comply with the October Order, the Local Rules, and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Rule 41(b) provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>Involuntary Dismissal:  Effect Thereof.   For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court, a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against the defendant.  Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication upon the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's \"choice of remedy under Rule 41(b) is reviewable only for abuse of discretion.\"  Figueroa Ruiz v.

Under this standard, we have affirmed dismissal with prejudice in circumstances much like those presented here.  In Figueroa Ruiz, for example, we affirmed dismissal of an action with prejudice where plaintiffs filed a deficient complaint, failed to respond to motions to dismiss, and failed to comply with a court order calling for explication of factual underpinnings of various RICO claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court has made clear that a district court's choice of sanctions for failure to comply with a court order or the Federal Rules will not be lightly disturbed upon appeal.

The October Order was issued after Appellants' counsel had objected to a tentative order dismissing the Complaint without prejudice.  Not only did Appellants' counsel make no effort to comply with the October Order, but he made no attempt to object to that Order by filing a motion for reconsideration showing good cause why it should be vacated or amended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court was also confronted with an attorney who erroneously insisted that he was not bound by Local Rules and that federal courts are mere conduits for the transfer of asbestos-related cases by the MDL Panel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Counsel's disregard of Local Rules was further reflected by his filing of a motion for extension of time without making and certifying service on opposing counsel.  In addition, during the four to five months that the action was pending, Appellants never responded to some twenty motions to dismiss filed by individual Appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">We have earlier noted that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>Courts cannot function if litigants may, with impunity, disobey lawful orders.

Without these facts in the complaint, defendants are helpless to answer or otherwise respond to it intelligently.
