On  appeal,  Saccoccia\r\n\nchallenges  his  extradition,  the   timing  of  his  trial,  his\r\n\nconviction, the  forfeiture of  certain assets, and  the 660-year\r\n\nsentence that  the  district court  imposed.   Finding  that  his\r\n\narguments do not wash, we affirm.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We sketch the bareboned facts in the light most amiable\r\n\nto the government, see United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 710-\r                                                       \r\n\n11 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1005 (1993), leaving\r                                          \r\n\nmuch of the flesh and sinew for fuller articulation in connection\r\n\nwith our discussion of particular issues.\r\n\n          Appellant  formerly  controlled a  network  of precious\r\n\nmetals  businesses  located  in   Rhode  Island,  New  York,  and\r\n\nCalifornia.  He  became enmeshed in money  laundering through his\r\n\ninvolvement  with a fellow metalman, Barry Slomovits.  At a point\r\n\nin the mid-1980s, Slomovits was  accepting millions of dollars in\r\n\ncash  each week from Duvan  Arboleda, who represented  a group of\r\n\nColombian drug lords (the  Cali cartel).  Slomovits used  some of\r\n\nthis  cash  to  purchase  gold   from  appellant.    By   special\r\n\narrangement,   the   transactions   were   accomplished   without\r\n\ndocumentation.\r\n\n          In 1987, Arboleda and  appellant agreed that they would\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\ndeal  directly  with each  other.   From  that  juncture forward,\r\n\nappellant used his various  businesses to cleanse money funnelled\r\n\nto him by the Cali cartel and its emissaries (including Arboleda,\r\n\nFernando Duenas,  and Raoul Escobar).   Typically, Arboleda would\r\n\nmake large  quantities of cash available  to appellant; appellant\r\n\nwould  send some of it to  Slomovits in New York; Slomovits would\r\n\nbuy gold with the funds,  resell the gold, and wire  the proceeds\r\n\nto  accounts  that  appellant  controlled.    Slomovits  received\r\n\napocryphal invoices from appellant's companies purporting to show\r\n\nsales of gold for sums corresponding  to the amounts of the  wire\r\n\ntransfers.\r\n\n          Ahron Sharir, a manufacturer of gold chain, also washed\r\n\nmoney for appellant.  Appellant used Sharir's New York factory as\r\n\na drop-off point for incoming  shipments of currency, and  Sharir\r\n\nlaundered  the  cash  by methods  similar  to  those  employed by\r\n\nSlomovits.   The  shipments to  Sharir's factory  continued until\r\n\n1988.   From then on, the  two men forsook the  New York factory,\r\n\nbut  continued to deal with each other.  Appellant delivered cash\r\n\ntotalling over  $35,000,000 to Sharir at  other locations between\r\n\n1988 and 1990.\r\n\n          By 1990,  appellant's operations  had expanded and  had\r\n\nbecome largely independent of Slomovits.  Appellant would bid for\r\n\nopportunities to  launder  money on  behalf of  the Cali  cartel.\r\n\nWhen the cartel accepted  a bid, he or his couriers would receive\r\n\nsacks  of  currency  at   prearranged  delivery  points.    These\r\n\nshipments   ordinarily  ranged   between  $50,000   and  $500,000\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n(although  one delivery  totalled  $3,000,000).   The bills  were\r\n\nusually  in   small  denominations.    They   would  be  counted,\r\n\ntransported to one of appellant's offices in California  or Rhode\r\n\nIsland,  then counted again, smurfed,1  and used to buy cashier's\r\n\nchecks payable to one of appellant's companies.   These purchases\r\n\nwere  made at  various  banks by  underlings  (e.g., David  Izzi,\r                                                             \r\n\nAnthony   DeMarco,   James  Saccoccio,   Kenneth   Saccoccio)  in\r\n\naccordance with instructions received from appellant or his wife,\r\n\nDonna  Saccoccia.   After  the checks  had  been deposited  in  a\r\n\ncompany account, the  money would then be wired to a foreign bank\r\n\ndesignated by Arboleda or Duenas.  Along the way, appellant would\r\n\ndeduct a commission that usually approximated ten percent  of the\r\n\nlaundered cash.  This completed \"la vuelta,\" the term used by the\r\n\nCali  cartel  to  describe  a complete  cycle  of  drug smuggling\r\n\nactivities.\r\n\n          The spring of 1991  marked the beginning of the  end of\r\n\nappellant's career in high  finance.  During the early  stages of\r\n\nhis  operation, the money received in New York was transported to\r\n\nRhode  Island by  armored car  and then  deposited in  an account\r\n\nstanding in the name of  a controlled corporation, Trend Precious\r\n\nMetals  (Trend), at Citizens Bank.   Between January  1, 1990 and\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The conspirators  sought to avoid the  currency transaction\r\nreporting  requirements  applicable to  large  cash transactions,\r\nsee,  e.g., 31  U.S.C.    5313 (1988);  31 C.F.R.    103.22(a)(1)\r                    \r\n(1994),  by subdividing the cash into units of less than $10,000.\r\nThe process of breaking down a large amount of cash into smaller,\r\nunreportable  amounts    a criminal  act when  done to  avoid the\r\nreporting  requirements, see 31 U.S.C.A.   5324 (West Supp. 1995)\r                                      \r\n  is called \"smurfing.\"\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nApril 2, 1991, appellant and his wife wired over $136,000,000 out\r\n\nof the Trend account to an assortment of foreign banks.  Citizens\r\n\nbecame  suspicious and closed the account.   In approximately the\r\n\nsame time frame,  an employee  of an armored  car service  warned\r\n\nRichard  Gizarelli, an  unindicted coconspirator,  that appellant\r\n\nwas  under investigation.  Gizarelli promptly informed appellant.\r\n\n          Notwithstanding  these omens, appellant  persisted.  He\r\n\ndid, however, alter his modus operandi.  Instead of using private\r                                                \r\n\ncouriers to transport cash from New York to Rhode Island, he sent\r\n\nany  of four  men    Izzi,  Carlo  DeMarco, Anthony  DeMarco,  or\r\n\nVincent  Hurley, often (but not  always) operating in  pairs   to\r\n\nhaul the  money  to  Rhode Island.    And,  although  appellant's\r\n\ncohorts  continued to  purchase  bank checks  from various  Rhode\r\n\nIsland financial institutions, appellant began to send the checks\r\n\nto his offices in  California by air courier, often  in canisters\r\n\nlabeled as  containing gold (to which  appellant's henchmen added\r\n\nslag  or scrap metal to  increase weight).   Accomplices used the\r\n\nmoney to purchase  gold, which was then sold on  the open market.\r\n\nThe proceeds  were eventually  wired back  to one  of appellant's\r\n\nremaining Rhode Island accounts.\r\n\n          In August of  1991, appellant convened a meeting at his\r\n\nmother's home.    He showed  the  conferees (who  included  Donna\r\n\nSaccoccia,  Izzi, and the two DeMarcos) a videotape that had been\r\n\ndiscovered accidentally in a nearby building.  The tape reflected\r\n\nan  ongoing  surveillance of  the  back  entrance to  appellant's\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nCranston coin shop.  He advised his colleagues to start using the\r\n\nstore's front entrance.   Soon thereafter, appellant departed for\r\n\nSwitzerland.    In  short  order, the  authorities  indicted  and\r\n\nextradited him.\r\n\n          After unsuccessfully seeking to postpone prosecution on\r\n\nhealth-related grounds,2  appellant went to trial  on November 4,\r\n\n1992, in the  United States  District Court for  the District  of\r\n\nRhode Island,  along with  several other  indicted coconspirators\r\n\n(including  his wife).   Appellant's  attorney became  ill during\r\n\ntrial, and the court declared a  mistrial as to appellant.3   The\r\n\nnew  trial  began  on February  17,  1993,  and  resulted in  his\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The  district court  held a  hearing regarding  appellant's\r\nprofessed ailments.  Appellant had undergone a laminectomy at age\r\n14 and had been hospitalized repeatedly during the next 20 years.\r\nHe suffered a relapse while  he was incarcerated in  Switzerland,\r\nnecessitating bed  rest and medication.  After  being returned to\r\nthe United  States, appellant claimed to have reinjured his back.\r\nHe  also  claimed that,  on  the  eve of  trial,  a prison  guard\r\nassaulted  him,  aggravating  his  condition.   The  court  heard\r\ntestimony from three physicians  and concluded that \"there [were]\r\nno  objective  findings by  any  doctor  that  would confirm  the\r\nexistence  of  any  physical   problem  that  would  account  for\r\n[appellant's current]  complaints  of pain.\"    Accordingly,  the\r\ncourt refused to grant a continuance.\r\n\n     3The  first trial proceeded as to the other defendants.  The\r\njury returned its verdict on  December 18, 1992, convicting Donna\r\nSaccoccia,  Vincent Hurley,  James Saccoccio,  Kenneth Saccoccio,\r\nStanley Cirella and Anthony DeMarco on the RICO conspiracy count,\r\n18 U.S.C.    1962(d), and finding each of them  guilty on certain\r\nother  counts.   Donna Saccoccia  was convicted  of 47  counts of\r\nmoney laundering  under 18 U.S.C.    1957 and 13  counts of money\r\nlaundering under 18 U.S.C.   1956(a)(2); Hurley  was convicted of\r\none count of structuring transactions to avoid currency reporting\r\nrequirements,  see   31  U.S.C.     5324(3),  and  one  count  of\r                            \r\ninterstate travel in aid  of racketeering, see 18 U.S.C.    1952;\r                                                        \r\nthe  two  Saccoccios  and  Cirella  were  likewise  convicted  of\r\nstructuring  violations under  31 U.S.C.    5324(3);  and Anthony\r\nDeMarco  was  convicted  of  filing  false  currency  transaction\r\nreports in violation of 31 U.S.C.   5324(2).\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nconviction.  These appeals followed.\r\n\n          Saccoccia's appeals were consolidated for oral argument\r\n\nwith the appeals arising out of  the first trial.  See supra note\r                                                                      \r\n\n3.  Notwithstanding  the obvious differences in the trial records\r\n\nand in the posture  of the prosecutions   for  example, appellant\r\n\nwas the  leader of the money laundering organization; unlike most\r\n\nof  the  others,  he  was  not  tried  for  currency  transaction\r\n\nreporting (CTR)  offenses;  and  he  was  convicted  in  a  trial\r\n\nseparate  from that  of  his codefendants     appellant seeks  to\r\n\nincorporate  by  reference  eight  arguments  advanced  by  other\r\n\ndefendants.   Because appellant's  position is  not substantially\r\n\nsimilar to that of the codefendants, and because he has failed to\r\n\ndevelop  the idiosyncracies of his own situation, we deem five of\r\n\nthose  arguments to have been  abandoned.4  See  United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nDavid, 940 F.2d 722, 737 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"Adoption by reference,\r               \r\n\nhowever,  cannot  occur  in  a  vacuum;  to  be  meaningful,  the\r\n\narguments  adopted  must   be  readily  transferrable  from   the\r\n\nproponent's case to the adopter's case.\"), cert. denied, 504 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n955 (1992).\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4The five  waived asseverations  comprise:  (1)  whether the\r\nCTR charges,  and the  evidence engendered thereby,  violated the\r\nFifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination; (2) whether\r\nthe district  court's jury instructions  overlooked the teachings\r\nof Reves  v. Ernst &amp; Young,  113 S. Ct. 1163  (1993); (3) whether\r                                    \r\nthe  court erred  in  instructing the  jury that  coconspirators'\r\nknowledge could be established  by evidence of willful blindness;\r\n(4)  whether  the court  erred in  determining  the scope  of the\r\ncharged conspiracy; and (5) whether the value of the washed funds\r\nas calculated for sentencing purposes improperly included revenue\r\nthat  the government conceded was  legitimate in origin.   In all\r\nevents, none of these contentions appears to have much bite.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\n          Nevertheless, we are left with no shortage of food  for\r\n\nthought.    Appellant has  served  up  a bouillabaisse  of  other\r\n\nofferings.  We address  his meatier propositions below, including\r\n\nthe three  \"incorporated\"  contentions that  arguably  have  been\r\n\npreserved.   And  although we  do  not deem  detailed  discussion\r\n\ndesirable,  the record  should  reflect that  we have  masticated\r\n\nappellant's remaining points and found them indigestible.\r\n\nII.  EXTRADITION\r          II.  EXTRADITION\r\n\n          As  a threshold  matter, appellant  maintains that  his\r\n\ntrial  and  ensuing conviction  violated  the  extradition treaty\r\n\nbetween the United  States and Switzerland, and,  in the bargain,\r\n\ntransgressed the  principles of dual  criminality and  specialty.\r\n\nWe reject these importunings.\r\n\n                     A.  Gaining Perspective.\r                               A.  Gaining Perspective.\r                                                      \r\n\n          Further   facts  are   needed   to  place   appellant's\r\n\nextradition-related  claims  into  a workable  perspective.    On\r\n\nNovember 18, 1991,  a federal grand jury returned  the indictment\r\n\nthat inaugurated  this prosecution.   Count 1  charged appellant,\r\n\nhis wife, and  eleven associates  with RICO conspiracy.   See  18\r                                                                       \r\n\nU.S.C.    1962(d) (1988).  A RICO conspiracy, of course, requires\r\n\nthe  government to  prove,  inter alia,  an illicit  agreement to\r                                                \r\n\nconduct a pattern of racketeering activity.

Proof of a pattern demands that the prosecution\r\n\nshow \"at least two acts  of racketeering activity.\"  18 U.S.C.   \r\n\n1961(5)  (1988).

See 18 U.S.C.    982, 1963.\r                                         \r\n\n          Six days after the  grand jury returned the indictment,\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nSwiss  authorities  arrested  the  Saccoccias in  Geneva.    They\r\n\ncontested  extradition on  counts 1  through 68,  and counts  143\r\n\nthrough 150.  On June 11, 1992, the  Swiss Federal Tribunal (SFT)\r\n\ngranted  extradition on  all  charges except  those contained  in\r\n\ncounts  2 through  68.   The SFT  reasoned that  these 67  counts\r\n\nconstituted  nonextraditable offenses  because Swiss law  did not\r\n\nprohibit the underlying  conduct.  The  SFT's discussion did  not\r\n\nspecifically mention the forfeiture allegations.\r\n\n          The Swiss  surrendered appellant to the  United States.\r\n\nHe was transported to Rhode Island and arraigned on July 15.  One\r\n\nweek later,  the grand  jury returned a  superseding indictment.5\r\n\nOn  July 30,  the Justice  Department, in  the person  of Michael\r\n\nO'Hare,  wrote to Tania Cavassini,  a Swiss official, enclosing a\r\n\ncopy  of  the superseding  indictment  and  inquiring whether  it\r\n\nrequired a waiver of the rule of specialty.\r\n\n          On  December  1, 1992,  apparently  in  response to  an\r\n\ninquiry from Cavassini,  O'Hare transmitted  a written  assurance\r\n\nthat, although  the court papers still  formally listed appellant\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5The charges  laid  against  appellant  in  the  superseding\r\nindictment  closely  paralleled those  contained in  the original\r\nbill.   Specifically, the grand  jury accused  appellant of  RICO\r\nconspiracy (count 1),  failure to file CTRs (counts  2-9), filing\r\nfalse   CTRs  (counts  10-22),  unlawfully  structuring  monetary\r\ntransactions  to   evade  filing  requirements   (counts  23-37),\r\nengaging  in monetary  transactions using  property derived  from\r\nillegal  activities (counts 38-98), money laundering (counts 121-\r\n33), and  interstate travel in  aid of racketeering  (counts 134-\r\n41).   Like the  original indictment, the  superseding indictment\r\nalleged violations of CTR  requirements as predicate offenses for\r\nthe RICO  conspiracy and Travel  Act counts,  and reiterated  the\r\nforfeiture allegations.  However, the superseding indictment  did\r\ninclude several counts not directed at appellant (counts 99-120).\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nas   a  defendant  in  respect  to  the  CTR  counts  (for  which\r\n\nextradition had been  denied), the prosecution did  not intend to\r\n\npress  those counts.  O'Hare explained  that the prosecutor would\r\n\noffer no evidence of appellant's guilt on those charges, with the\r\n\nresult  that \"American law [will require] the judge to direct the\r\n\njury  to  find the  defendant not  guilty.\"   The  following day,\r\n\nCavassini advised  that, under a \"final  decision\" dated November\r\n\n20, 1992, the SFT had \"granted extradition of [appellant] for the\r\n\nfacts enclosed in the Count Nr. 1 of the Superseding Indictment.\"\r\n\nCavassini also indicated that appellant's local counsel in Geneva\r\n\nagreed with the  SFT's decision and had  scotched any possibility\r\n\nof a further appeal.\r\n\n          On February 2, 1993, before the start of the trial with\r\n\nwhich  we are concerned,  the government  moved to  dismiss those\r\n\ncounts of  the superseding indictment (counts  2-37) that charged\r\n\nappellant with CTR offenses.   The district court complied.   The\r\n\nmatter  resurfaced in a  slightly different shape  ten days later\r\n\nwhen   appellant's  Swiss  lawyer,   Paul  Gully-Hart,  wrote  to\r\n\nCavassini   expressing   concern   that   appellant's   impending\r\n\nprosecution on charges  in which CTR violations  were embedded as\r\n\npredicates for other offenses would insult the rule of specialty.\r\n\nOn March 2, Gully-Hart wrote again, this time enclosing a copy of\r\n\nthe prosecution's opening statement to the petit jury.  Cavassini\r\n\nforwarded both of these letters to O'Hare.  On March 8, Cavassini\r\n\nspoke  with O'Hare and voiced her concern that appellant might be\r\n\nconvicted under count 1 solely on the basis of CTR offenses.\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\n          The next  day, Assistant  United States  Attorney James\r\n\nLeavey, a  member of the  prosecution team, advised  Judge Torres\r\n\nthat  he had  spoken with  O'Hare.   Without conceding  the legal\r\n\nvalidity  of  Gully-Hart's  point,  Leavey  asked  the  court  to\r\n\ninstruct  the  jury  that  CTR  violations  could  not  serve  as\r\n\npredicates  for purposes of either the RICO or Travel Act counts.\r\n\nWhen the  court acquiesced,  the government submitted  a redacted\r\n\nindictment that deleted  all references to CTR offenses  from the\r\n\nRICO  and Travel Act counts.   Appellant nonetheless  moved for a\r\n\nmistrial, invoking the rules of dual criminality and specialty.\r\n\n          The  district court denied  the motion, explaining that\r\n\nit  had  agreed  to  the  government's  proposal  purely   as  an\r\n\naccommodation.   In the  judge's view,  the precautions were  not\r\n\nlegally required because the SFT had been pellucid in authorizing\r\n\nprosecution  on the  RICO  count  even  though  the  claimed  CTR\r\n\nviolations   were  prominently  displayed  therein  as  potential\r\n\npredicates.    The  judge   noted,  moreover,  that  evidence  of\r\n\nappellant's  CTR  violations  was  in all  events  admissible  in\r\n\nconnection with  the substantive  money laundering counts  (as to\r\n\nwhich extradition had been  approved).  Appellant resurrected the\r\n\nissue in his  motion for a new  trial following the  adverse jury\r\n\nverdict.  The court stood firm.\r\n\n               B.

We\r\n\nelaborate below.\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\n          1.     Dual  Criminality.     The  principle   of  dual\r                    1.     Dual  Criminality.\r                                            \r\n\ncriminality  dictates that,  as a  general rule,  an extraditable\r\n\noffense must be a  serious crime (rather than a  mere peccadillo)\r\n\npunishable  under the criminal laws  of both the surrendering and\r\n\nthe requesting  state.  See Brauch  v. Raiche, 618 F.2d  843, 847\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1980).   The current  extradition  treaty between  the\r\n\nUnited States and Switzerland embodies this  concept.  See Treaty\r                                                                    \r\n\nof  Extradition, May  14, 1900,  U.S.-Switz.,  Art. II,  31 Stat.\r\n\n1928, 1929-30 (Treaty).\r\n\n          The principle of dual  criminality does not demand that\r\n\nthe  laws of  the surrendering  and requesting  states be  carbon\r\n\ncopies  of one  another.   Thus,  dual  criminality will  not  be\r\n\ndefeated by differences in the instrumentalities or in the stated\r\n\npurposes of the two nations' laws.  See Peters v. Egnor, 888 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n713,  719 (10th Cir. 1989).   By the  same token, the counterpart\r\n\ncrimes  need  not  have  identical  elements.     See  Matter  of\r                                                                           \r\n\nExtradition  of  Russell, 789  F.2d  801,  803  (9th Cir.  1986).\r                                  \r\n\nInstead,  dual criminality is deemed to be satisfied when the two\r\n\ncountries'  laws are  substantially analogous.   See  Peters, 888\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at  719; Brauch, 618 F.2d at 851.  Moreover, in mulling dual\r                              \r\n\ncriminality  concerns,  courts  are  duty  bound  to  defer to  a\r\n\nsurrendering  sovereign's  reasonable   determination  that   the\r\n\noffense  in question is extraditable.  See Casey v. Department of\r                                                                           \r\n\nState,  980 F.2d 1472, 1477  (D.C.

If\r\n\nthe  same  conduct  is  subject  to criminal  sanctions  in  both\r\n\njurisdictions, no more is  exigible.  See United States  v.

See United States v. Thirion,\r                                                                          \r\n\n813 F.2d 146,  151 (8th  Cir. 1987).   The requesting state  must\r\n\n\"live  up to  whatever  promises  it  made  in  order  to  obtain\r\n\nextradition\"   because   preservation  of   the   institution  of\r\n\nextradition   requires   the   continuing   cooperation   of  the\r\n\nsurrendering state.

Predicate  Acts.   Appellant's flagship  contention\r                    1.  Predicate  Acts.\r                                       \r\n\nrests   on  the  postulate  that   an  offense  which  is  itself\r\n\nnonextraditable  cannot serve  as a  predicate act  in connection\r\n\nwith other,  extraditable  offenses;  and  that,  therefore,  the\r\n\ngovernment's  use of  nonextraditable CTR  offenses  as predicate\r\n\nacts for purposes  of the RICO and Travel Act  counts crossed the\r\n\nline  into forbidden territory.  Even if we assume, however, that\r\n\nin  some  situations  reliance  on  nonextraditable  offenses  as\r\n\npredicates for  other, extraditable  offenses might run  afoul of\r\n\ndual criminality  or specialty principles,  the circumstances  of\r\n\nthis case present no such problem.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6There  is some  dispute whether  alleged violations  of the\r\nprinciple of  specialty can  be raised  by a  criminal defendant.\r\nSee, e.g., Demjanjuk, 776 F.2d at 583-84 (questioning whether the\r                              \r\nperson being extradited \"has standing to assert the  principle of\r\nspecialty\");  Kaiser v. Rutherford, 827 F. Supp. 832, 835 (D.D.C.\r                                            \r\n1993) (asserting that \"[t]he rule of specialty is not a right  of\r\nthe accused  but is a privilege of the asylum state and therefore\r\n[the defendant] has no standing  to raise this issue\")  (internal\r\nquotation  marks omitted).    We need  not  probe the  matter  of\r\nstanding for three reasons.  First,  while we take no view of the\r\nissue, we  realize that there are two sides to the story, and the\r\nside  that  favors individual  standing has  much to  commend it.\r\nSee, e.g., United States v. Rauscher, 119 U.S. 407, 422-24 (1886)\r                                              \r\n(referring  to  specialty  as  a \"right  conferred  upon  persons\r\nbrought  from a  foreign country\"  via extradition  proceedings);\r\nThirion, 813 F.2d at 151 &amp;  n.5 (to like effect); see also United\r                                                                           \r\nStates   v.  Alvarez-Machain,   504  U.S.   655,  659-60   (1992)\r                                      \r\n(suggesting  the continuing  vitality of the  Rauscher decision).\r                                                                \r\nSecond, the government has  advised us that, for policy  reasons,\r\nit  does not  challenge  appellant's standing  in this  instance.\r\nThird, appellant's asseverations are more easily dismissed on the\r\nmerits.   See  Norton  v.  Mathews,  427  U.S.  524,  532  (1976)\r                                            \r\n(explaining that jurisdictional questions  may be bypassed when a\r\nruling on the merits will achieve the same result).\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\n          In  general,  we do  not believe  that  there can  be a\r\n\nviolation  of the  principle  of specialty  where the  requesting\r\n\nnation  prosecutes the returned fugitive for  the exact crimes on\r\n\nwhich  the surrendering  nation granted  extradition.   So  it is\r\n\nhere:  the SFT twice  approved appellant's extradition on  counts\r\n\nthat  prominently  featured CTR  offenses  as  predicates.   This\r\n\napproval   to which we must pay the substantial deference that is\r\n\ndue to a surrendering  court's resolution of questions pertaining\r\n\nto extraditability, see, e.g., Casey, 980 F.2d at 1477   strongly\r                                              \r\n\nsuggests  that  the RICO  and  Travel Act  counts,  despite their\r\n\nmention of  predicates which,  standing alone, would  not support\r\n\nextradition,  are  compatible  with  the criminal  laws  of  both\r\n\njurisdictions.    Though a  Swiss  official  may informally  have\r\n\nfretted about the  prospect of  a RICO or  Travel Act  conviction\r\n\nbased on nonextraditable predicates, we are reluctant to conclude\r\n\non this gossamer showing that the SFT did not know and appreciate\r\n\nthe  clearly  expressed  contents   of  the  indictment  when  it\r\n\nsanctioned extradition.\r\n\n          To   clinch  matters,   the  prosecution   avoided  any\r\n\npotential intrusion on the  principles of either dual criminality\r\n\nor specialty by taking a series of prophylactic actions at trial.\r\n\nThe  fourth redacted  indictment  removed all  references to  CTR\r\n\noffenses  from  the compendium  of  charges  pressed against  the\r\n\nappellant.   The judge  then reinforced  this  fumigation of  the\r\n\nindictment by advising  the jurors that  they should not  concern\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nthemselves  with   whether  appellant   had  committed   any  CTR\r\n\noffenses.7  These  precautions purged any taint,  and knocked the\r\n\nlegs out from under the line of reasoning that appellant seeks to\r\n\npursue.\r\n\n          2.   Keeping Faith.   Next, appellant  asserts that the\r                    2.   Keeping Faith.\r                                      \r\n\ngovernment infringed  on the  principle of specialty  by breaking\r\n\nits promise to the  Swiss government and introducing  evidence of\r\n\nCTR violations at  appellant's trial.  Abstractly, we  agree with\r\n\nthe  core  element of  appellant's  premise:   the  principle  of\r\n\nspecialty requires the requesting state to abide by the  promises\r\n\nit  makes to the surrendering  state in the  process of procuring\r\n\nextradition.  See Najohn, 785 F.2d at 1422.  But, concretely,  we\r                                  \r\n\nare  unable  to discern  any breach  of  faith in  this instance.\r\n\nThus,  we resist the  conclusion that appellant  would foist upon\r\n\nus.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7The judge instructed the jury:\r\n\n          You have  heard references during  this trial\r\n          to     currency     transaction     reporting\r\n          requirements and I should make it clear  that\r\n          you are  not being  called upon  to determine\r\n          whether the defendant  violated or  conspired\r\n          to   violate   any  of   those  requirements.\r\n          Therefore,   you    may   consider   evidence\r\n          regarding the nature of currency transactions\r\n          with banks to the  extent that such evidence,\r\n          in your view,  may bear on the  source of the\r\n          money involved and/or the purposes  for which\r\n          the   money  may  have  been  transferred  or\r\n          transported.   But in reaching  your verdict,\r\n          you   may  not  consider   whether  any  such\r\n          transactions were or were not consistent with\r\n          transaction reporting requirements because, .\r\n          . . as I have just said, that is not an issue\r\n          in this case. . . .\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\n          To buttress the  claim that the  United States did  not\r\n\nkeep   its  word,   appellant  avers   that  O'Hare's   facsimile\r\n\ntransmission,  sent  on  December  1, 1992,  was  the  functional\r\n\nequivalent of an  assurance that the prosecutor would not present\r\n\nany evidence to the jury regarding Saccoccia's noncompliance with\r\n\nCTR  requirements.    Fairly read,  the  document     despite its\r\n\niteration  that  the  prosecutor   \"would  present  no   evidence\r\n\nregarding  [Saccoccia's] guilt  . .  . on  the charges  for which\r\n\nextradition  was  not granted\"     does  not support  appellant's\r\n\nconstruction.    O'Hare  sent  the  transmittal  in  response  to\r\n\nCavassini's  expression  of  concern  that  appellant   might  be\r\n\nconvicted  of charges for which extradition had been denied.  His\r\n\nreply, taken in context, see supra pp. 10-11, amounted to no more\r                                            \r\n\nthan  an assurance against that  possibility.  To  read a promise\r                                                      \r\n\nnot  to introduce  any evidence  relevant to CTR  violations into\r\n\nO'Hare's  statement  would  necessitate   wresting  it  from  its\r\n\ncontextual  moorings  and  unreasonably  stretching  its  literal\r\n\nmeaning.   We decline appellant's  invitation to indulge  in such\r\n\nphantasmagoric wordplay.8\r\n\n          3.   The  Claimed  \"Prosecution.\"    Appellant's  third\r                    3.   The  Claimed  \"Prosecution.\"\r                                                     \r\n\ncontention  is  that the  government  violated  the principle  of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8Of course,  appellant had  already been extradited  and the\r\nSwiss authorities had already approved the superseding indictment\r\nbefore this supposed  promise was  made.  This  places a  further\r\nobstacle  in appellant's  path:   it  strikes  us as  problematic\r\nwhether the breach of a promise made after the defendant has been\r                                                    \r\nextradited,  without more,  furnishes  a basis  for reversing  an\r\nensuing  conviction.   In  such  circumstances, the  surrendering\r\nstate,  by definition, has  not relied on  the requesting state's\r\npromise in deciding to return the defendant.\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\nspecialty  because it prosecuted him for CTR offenses.  Since the\r\n\nnonextraditable CTR counts, as  they pertained to appellant, were\r\n\ndismissed  before the second trial began, his claim is founded on\r\n\nno  more than the fact  that his name  appeared on the indictment\r\n\nduring   the  first  trial.     While   this  may   literally  be\r\n\n\"prosecution,\"  it is prosecution in name  only   and we will not\r\n\ncarry  hollow formalism  to a  point at  which it  engulfs common\r\n\nsense.    Consequently, we  hold that  the  mere existence  of an\r\n\nunredacted indictment,  under the circumstances of  this case, is\r\n\nno reason to  invalidate Saccoccia's conviction.   Cf. Tacket  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nDelco Remy Div.  of Gen. Motors Corp.,  937 F.2d 1201, 1202  (7th\r                                               \r\n\nCir. 1991)  (Bauer, C.J.) (quoting  doggerel to  the effect  that\r\n\n\"[s]ticks  and stones may break  your bones, but  names can never\r\n\nhurt you\").\r\n\n          This leaves appellant's argument  that he was illegally\r\n\n\"prosecuted\" because CTR offenses were included as predicate acts\r\n\nfor  purposes of the RICO and  Travel Act counts until the fourth\r\n\nredacted  indictment  surfaced.   As  we  have already  observed,\r\n\nhowever, it  would have been perfectly proper  for the government\r\n\nto  seek convictions  on those  counts based  on CTR  predicates.\r\n\nHence, appellant's argument is without merit.9\r\n\n          For these reasons, we  find appellant's conviction free\r\n\nfrom taint under the applicable extradition laws.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9If more is needed    and we do not believe that it is   the\r\nevidence  of  CTR violations,  by  and  large, was  independently\r\nadmissible  to support  various aspects  of the  money laundering\r\ncharges and  other substantive  counts for which  extradition was\r\nexplicitly approved.\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nIII.  THE COVETED CONTINUANCE\r          III.  THE COVETED CONTINUANCE\r\n\n          Appellant contends that the district  court arbitrarily\r\n\nrefused  him  a lengthy  continuance prior  to  the start  of the\r\n\nsecond  trial,10 leaving him  with insufficient preparation time.\r\n\nOur  analysis of the record indicates that the court acted within\r\n\nits discretion in scotching appellant's request.\r\n\n                      A.

Soon\r\n\nthereafter,   Austrian  authorities   arrested  Hill   for  money\r\n\nlaundering.    Hill  languished  in prison  from  August  through\r\n\nNovember of 1992.  During that interval, he could not communicate\r\n\nwith, or effectively assist, Saccoccia.  Adae, who had originally\r\n\nbeen enlisted as local counsel, stepped into the breach and acted\r\n\nas  lead  counsel.   Shortly after  the  first trial  began, Adae\r\n\nbecame  ill.  The court granted appellant's motion for a mistrial\r\n\nand ordered a severance.  The case proceeded to verdict vis-a-vis\r\n\nthe other defendants.  See supra note 3.\r                                          \r\n\n          Naturally, the severance required a separate trial  for\r\n\nappellant.    The  district  court proposed  to  start  in  early\r\n\nFebruary  of 1993.   Within  a  matter of  days  after the  court\r\n\nannounced the schedule, Hill,  recently released from an Austrian\r\n\nprison, and  Kenneth O'Donnell, a prominent  Rhode Island defense\r\n\nlawyer, entered appearances as  appellant's counsel.  On December\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     10Appellant  does not  assign  error to  the  denial of  the\r\ncontinuances  that he  sought before  the first  (aborted) trial.\r\nSee supra note 2.\r                   \r\n\n                                22\r\r\n\n10, 1992,  appellant signed an extensive waiver  of the potential\r\n\nconflict of interest posed  by Hill's representation of him  at a\r\n\ntime when Hill himself faced charges of money  laundering arising\r\n\nout of activities undertaken in conjunction with appellant.\r\n\n          On the same  day, the  court held a  hearing anent  the\r\n\nwaiver.  Among other  things, appellant requested that his  trial\r\n\nbe rescheduled  to April of 1993  so that his  defense team could\r\n\nhave  more time  to  prepare.   He claimed  this  extra time  was\r\n\nnecessary  to  review  financial  documents,  study  surveillance\r\n\ntapes, glean exculpatory evidence, and analyze inconsistencies in\r\n\nthe statements of government witnesses.  The court granted only a\r\n\ntwo-week  extension, from February 3 to  February 17, noting that\r\n\nthe original  indictment  had  been returned  in  1991  and  that\r\n\ncounsel   already   had   enjoyed  a   considerable   period  for\r\n\npreparation.   Subsequent  requests  for  continuances were  also\r\n\ndenied.\r\n\n                 B.  Applicable Legal Principles.\r                           B.

And,  moreover,  the  record  belies  appellant's\r\n\ncontention  that the  court's  obduracy  unfairly prejudiced  his\r\n\nrights  by leaving  him insufficient  time to prepare  for trial.\r\n\nAppellant's  most loudly  bruited  point is  that the  government\r\n\nproduced  1600 hours of wiretap audio tapes, and that he had only\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\n67 days, which he  translates as equalling 1608 hours,  to listen\r\n\nto them.  Although this lament has some superficial plausibility,\r\n\nwe agree with the district court that, notwithstanding the number\r\n\nof tapes, it was reasonable to expect defense counsel to be ready\r\n\nfor trial in February.  We explain briefly.\r\n\n          The grand jury indicted  appellant in November of 1991.\r\n\nThus,  appellant's counsel,  collectively, had  far more  than 67\r\n\ndays in which to work on the case.  Moreover, the lawyers had the\r\n\nnot-inconsiderable  benefit  of   a  dress  rehearsal,  including\r\n\nunlimited access to  the full record of the first trial (in which\r\n\nvirtually   the  entire  case   against  appellant   was  aired).\r\n\nO'Donnell,  one  of  appellant's  new  attorneys,  was especially\r\n\nfamiliar  with  the  situation   because  he  had  represented  a\r\n\ncodefendant  who   had  been  acquitted  in   a  separate  trial.\r\n\nFurthermore, Hill and O'Donnell could   and no doubt did   confer\r\n\nwith counsel for  the codefendants  and with Attorney  Adae.   In\r\n\nshort, the means for efficacious preparation were tidily at hand.\r\n\n          Appellant's other assertions of supposed prejudice also\r\n\nlack force.  For example, his suggestion that a continuance might\r\n\nhave  enabled  him to  receive  a  complete transcript  of  Agent\r\n\nShedd's  conversation with  Duenas  overlooks the  fact that  the\r\n\ngovernment provided him  with the entire  transcript.  See  infra\r                                                                           \r\n\nPart  IV (E).  His  claim that more  time was needed  to obtain a\r\n\ncopy of a  DEA report  that he asserts  would have bolstered  the\r\n\ntestimony of an expert witness overlooks the fact that the expert\r\n\nknew of the report and described its conclusions.  See infra note\r                                                                      \r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\n18.   His  claim that  a  continuance would  have enabled  him to\r\n\nobtain enhanced versions of two  of the surveillance tapes before\r\n\ntrial, see  infra Part IV  (F), is completely  unpersuasive given\r                           \r\n\nhis  assertion  that  the  enhanced tapes,  when  received,  were\r\n\n\"unclear\" and \"unintelligible.\"  Appellant's  Brief at 36.   And,\r\n\nfinally,  appellant's exhortation  that a continuance  would have\r\n\nallowed him to investigate whether the laundered cash represented\r\n\ngambling  proceeds, as opposed to drug money, is unaccompanied by\r\n\nany  colorable  basis  for  assuming  that  his  supposition  was\r\n\nanything more than the most remote of possibilities.\r\n\n          In  a nutshell,  appellant  has not  made a  sufficient\r\n\nshowing  of  undue prejudice  to  warrant  us in  second-guessing\r\n\neither  the district court's resolve  to start the  trial in mid-\r\n\nFebruary  of 1993 or  its decision to grant  appellant a far more\r\n\nmodest delay than  he requested.   Since the  record reflects  no\r\n\npressing need for an extended continuance,  and likewise fails to\r\n\ndemonstrate  significant harm flowing  from the lack  of one, the\r\n\ndenial  of the  motion for a  continuance cannot be  said to have\r\n\nsubstantially impaired  appellant's defense.   See, e.g., Dennis,\r                                                                          \r\n\n843 F.2d at 653 n.1.  Thus, no cognizable error inheres.\r\n\n                    D.

This\r\n\nconstruct  does not  withstand  scrutiny.    To  show  an  actual\r\n\nconflict of interest, a criminal defendant \"must demonstrate that\r\n\nsome  plausible  alternative  defense  strategy  might  have been\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\npursued\"  and \"that  this  alternative strategy  was not  pursued\r\n\nbecause of the attorney's other  loyalties or interests.\"  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

Appellant cannot meet this standard.\r\n\n          Appellant sees the conflict  of interest as centered in\r\n\nHill's  need   to  protect  himself  at   his  client's  expense.\r\n\nAppellant  supports  this  accusation by  repeated  reference  to\r\n\nHill's indictment  in Austria on  charges that he  conspired with\r\n\nappellant  to launder  the  fruits  of  unlawful activity     but\r\n\nappellant does not suggest any way in which this alleged conflict\r\n\nof interest  adversely affected  Hill's representation of  him at\r\n\ntrial.  What is more, appellant's claim that he was faced with an\r\n\nintolerable  dilemma    he could  accept Hill  as his  counsel or\r\n\nproceed to trial with an attorney who was untutored in the case  \r\n\nis flatly contradicted by the record.\r\n\n          Appellant   insisted,  time  and   again,  despite  the\r\n\ndistrict   court's  painstaking  explanation   of  his  right  to\r\n\nconflict-free  counsel,  that  Hill   was  the  advocate  of  his\r\n\nchoosing.    Appellant  told  the  court  unequivocally  that  he\r\n\nunderstood the potential conflict,  but desired Hill's  services.\r\n\nAnd  he  adhered  to  his position  notwithstanding  the  court's\r\n\nentreaty  to reconsider and its  advice that he  would be \"better\r\n\noff\" with an attorney free of any ties to the situation.\r\n\n          Last     but surely  not least    appellant  executed a\r\n\nwritten waiver  stating that, after \"[h]aving  been fully advised\r\n\n                                28\r\r\n\nof the  possible adverse consequences arising from  the actual or\r\n\npotential  conflicts with which Hill is or may be encumbered,\" he\r\n\n\"knowingly, voluntarily, intelligently, and  irrevocably [wishes]\r\n\nto  waive any  and  all such  actual  or potential  conflicts  of\r\n\ninterest for the purpose of retaining Hill as his counsel.\"  When\r\n\na defendant knowingly selects a course of action, fully cognizant\r\n\nof  its perils, he cannot  later repudiate it  simply because his\r\n\ncase curdles.  In the circumstances  at bar, it is neither unfair\r\n\nnor unjust to  hold appellant to  his words.  Thus,  the district\r\n\ncourt's   determination  that   appellant  had   voluntarily  and\r\n\nknowingly waived  his  right to  conflict-free representation  is\r\n\nunimpugnable.   See Holloway v.  Arkansas, 435 U.S.  475, 483 n.5\r                                                   \r\n\n(1978)  (stating that  \"a defendant  may waive  his right  to the\r\n\nassistance   of  an   attorney  unhindered   by  a   conflict  of\r\n\ninterests\").\r\n\n          Appellant has another arrow in this quiver.  He reasons\r\n\nthat the court should have overlooked his waiver of conflict-free\r\n\ncounsel  because Hill's  continued representation  constituted an\r\n\nunwaivable  constitutional  transgression.   To  be  sure, a  few\r\n\ncourts have found a per se Sixth Amendment violation \"where trial\r\n\ncounsel was implicated in the crime  for which his client was  on\r\n\ntrial.\"  Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d at 487 n.4 (citing cases).  But\r                                  \r\n\nthese  cases tend to  involve circumstances in  which an attorney\r\n\nhas reason to fear  that a vigorous defense  of the client  might\r\n\nunearth proof of the  attorney's criminality.  See,  e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Cancilla, 725  F.2d 867, 870 (2d Cir.  1984).  Although\r                            \r\n\n                                29\r\r\n\nHill  informed the court, in the vaguest of generalities, that he\r\n\nfeared  being charged or called as a witness in appellant's case,\r\n\nhe provided  no substantiation of  these assertions,  nor was  he\r\n\nable  to explain  how the  hypothetical conflict  would,  at that\r\n\ntime, affect his representation of the appellant.  Therefore, the\r\n\ndistrict court seems entirely justified in concluding that Hill's\r\n\nrepresentation of appellant would not be  hampered by a realistic\r\n\nforeboding that  vigorous advocacy would uncover  evidence of his\r\n\nown  crimes.  Cf. William  Shakespeare, Macbeth, Act  I, sc. iii,\r                                                         \r\n\nll.  133-34  (1605) (noting  that  \"present fears  are  less than\r\n\nhorrible imaginings\").\r\n\n          The  sockdolager  is  that,  wholly  apart  from Hill's\r\n\nstatus,  appellant  was  also  represented at  trial  by  another\r\n\nlawyer,  O'Donnell, who  had no  conflict of  interest.13   In an\r\n\neffort to scale this  rampart, appellant suggests that O'Donnell,\r\n\ntoo,  had an  actual  conflict of  interest  arising out  of  his\r\n\nprevious representation  of a  codefendant, Raymond Marotto.   By\r\n\nDecember of 1992, however, Marotto,  a bank employee charged with\r\n\nfailing to file  CTRs, had  been acquitted in  a separate  trial.\r\n\nAppellant's  convoluted explanation of  how O'Donnell's concluded\r\n\nrepresentation  of  Marotto created  a  conflict  of interest  is\r\n\ndifficult to follow.  He seems to be saying, without any citation\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     13At the  December 10,  1992 waiver hearing,  O'Donnell told\r\nthe court that he had been \"independently retained by [appellant]\r\nto be local counsel and  co-counsel.\"  He assured the court  that\r\nhe would  \"independently advise  [appellant] with respect  to any\r\nmatters that  might  be affected  by  any potential  conflict  of\r\ninterest Mr. Hill might have.\"\r\n\n                                30\r\r\n\nto  the record, that  Marotto (who was  not called to  testify at\r\n\nappellant's trial) could have been a material witness.  We reject\r\n\nthis unfounded speculation.\r\n\n          As O'Donnell himself pointed out, Marotto's case turned\r\n\non  whether he did    or did not    have a responsibility to file\r\n\nCTRs.  There is nothing in the record that  suggests that Marotto\r\n\nhad  any  knowledge that  might have  been useful  in appellant's\r\n\ndefense.    We have  routinely  dismissed  analogous conflict  of\r\n\ninterest  claims, see,  e.g., Garcia-Rosa,  876 F.2d  at 231  (so\r                                                   \r\n\nholding  when  defendant \"provide[d]  no substantiation\"  for his\r\n\nassertion  that  his counsel  had  a  conflict of  interest  that\r\n\nmanifested itself when he did not call as a witness a person whom\r\n\nhe previously had represented),  and we dismiss appellant's claim\r\n\non the same basis.  It is simply too flimsy.\r\n\n                    E.  The Mid-Trial Motion.\r                              E.  The Mid-Trial Motion.\r                                                      \r\n\n          At  the  close  of  the  government's  case,  appellant\r\n\nsubmitted  a proffer  in  support  of  a  renewed  motion  for  a\r\n\ncontinuance.  The proffer  suggested a global conspiracy \"between\r\n\nthe Israeli intelligence services and the CIA,\" and asserted that\r\n\nhe had witnesses  who \"would  testify about such  matters as  the\r\n\nIsraeli defense industry\" and \"[t]he method by which the building\r\n\nof Israeli religious schools  is financed by Hasidic Jews  in the\r\n\nUnited States who engage in money laundering.\"  Appellant claimed\r\n\nthat his counsel needed time to investigate the matters described\r\n\nin the proffer.\r\n\n          The district court  found the proffer to be  \"too vague\r\n\n                                31\r\r\n\nand  unsubstantiated  to  constitute   a  basis  for  granting  a\r\n\ncontinuance\"  because  its  \"conclusory  allegations\"  offered no\r\n\nexplanation as to its relevancy to the case.  Moreover, the court\r\n\nfound no evidence that  diligent efforts had been made  to assure\r\n\navailability of  the  testimony and  documents in  a proper  time\r\n\nframe.   Hence, the court determined that the proffer afforded an\r\n\ninadequate basis for the requested continuance.\r\n\n          We discern no  abuse of discretion.  While  the proffer\r\n\nweaves a tale of  intrigue worthy of an Oliver  Stone screenplay,\r\n\nwe are unable  to distill sufficient  relevance or likelihood  of\r\n\nsuccess  from   its  sinister  allegations  to   suggest  that  a\r\n\ncontinuance, if granted, would have proven useful.\r\n\nIV.  MONEY AND DRUGS\r          IV.  MONEY AND DRUGS\r\n\n          In order to obtain a conviction on the money laundering\r\n\ncounts, as charged in  the superseding indictment, the government\r\n\nhad the burden of  proving that the laundered funds  were derived\r\n\nfrom the narcotics trade.  See 18 U.S.C.   1956(a)(2).  Appellant\r                                        \r\n\nchallenges  both the  admissibility  and the  sufficiency of  the\r\n\nevidence  introduced   for  this  purpose.     The  challenge  is\r\n\nunavailing.\r\n\n                     A.  Standard of Review.\r                               A.

See United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nPaulino, 13 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 1994); Zannino, 895 F.2d at 16-\r                                                          \r\n\n17; United States v.

The  district court  is the  primary  arbiter of  how these\r\n\nscales  should be  calibrated.   On appeal,  we will  reverse its\r\n\ndetermination  only  if  admitting  the  evidence  constituted  a\r\n\npalpable abuse of discretion.  See  United States v.

In  that  connection,  the  inquiry  turns  on\r\n\nwhether, \"after  assaying  all the  evidence  in the  light  most\r\n\namiable to  the government, and taking  all reasonable inferences\r\n\nin  its  favor,  a  rational  factfinder  could  find,  beyond  a\r\n\nreasonable doubt,  that the  prosecution successfully  proved the\r\n\nessential elements of the  crime.\"  United States v.

Appellant's  argument\r\n\nfocuses on  evidence adduced, or remarks made,  at four different\r\n\npoints during his trial.  First, appellant accuses the government\r\n\nof  eliciting testimony concerning the birthplaces of Escobar and\r\n\nGarcia  (both of whom were born in Colombia), while not inquiring\r\n\nabout any other individual's  place of birth.  Second,  the court\r\n\npermitted Sharir to testify that appellant told him to be careful\r\n\nbecause  he was dealing with  Colombians, who would  go after his\r\n\nfamily  if they were crossed.  Third, when Donald Semesky, an IRS\r\n\n                                34\r\r\n\nagent,  offered  expert testimony  as  to the  modus  operandi of\r                                                                        \r\n\nColombian drug  cartels, he  mentioned, among other  things, that\r\n\ntwo Colombian cartels control  the illegal importation of cocaine\r\n\ninto  the United  States,  and that  their narcotics  trafficking\r\n\ngenerates much cash, necessitating money laundering.  Fourth, the\r\n\ngovernment's summation hammered these same points.\r\n\n          Due to the singular  importance of keeping our criminal\r\n\njustice  system on  an even  keel, respecting  the rights  of all\r\n\npersons,   courts   must   not  tolerate   prosecutors'   efforts\r\n\ngratuitously  to  inject  issues  like race  and  ethnicity  into\r\n\ncriminal trials.   See McClesky v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 309 &amp; n.30\r                                                 \r\n\n(1987); United States  v. Doe, 903 F.2d 16,  21 (D.C. Cir. 1990).\r                                       \r\n\nEmphasizing  a  person's  national  origin  not  only  may  raise\r\n\nconcerns   of  relevancy,  undue   prejudice,  and  prosecutorial\r\n\nmisconduct, but also may pose issues of constitutional dimension.\r\n\nSee, e.g.,  United States v.  Vue, 13  F.3d 1206, 1213  (8th Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1994);  United States v.

A\r\n\ntrial involves a search for the truth, and, as such, it cannot be\r\n\nentirely antiseptic.  The trick is to separate impermissible uses\r\n\nof  highly charged evidence from  those uses that  are proper and\r\n\npermissible.  See  United States  v. Alzanki,      F.3d    ,     \r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) [No. 94-1645,  slip op. at 25-26]; Doe, 903  F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\nat 25.

In  the case\r\n\nat bar, all the  evidence about Colombia, viewed in  context, was\r\n\nproperly  admitted and  used.   By  like token,  the prosecutor's\r\n\ncomments were not beyond the pale.\r\n\n          Appellant's  first  contention is  factually incorrect.\r\n\nThe  prosecutor asked  several witnesses  other than  Escobar and\r\n\nGarcia (e.g., Sharir and  Slomovits) where they were born.   Seen\r                      \r\n\nin this light, the  casual questioning about place of  birth, not\r\n\nobjected to at trial,  cannot conceivably plunge to the  plane of\r\n\nplain error.\r\n\n          Similarly, Sharir's testimony  that Saccoccia told  him\r\n\nto  be  wary because  he was  dealing  with Colombians  is highly\r\n\nprobative  on  the  issue   of  appellant's  knowledge  that  the\r\n\nlaundered funds were derived  from illegal activities.  Moreover,\r\n\ncommon sense suggests that drug traffickers are more likely than,\r\n\nsay,  Avon ladies, to harm the families of business associates if\r\n\na deal sours.  It is, therefore,  a gross exaggeration to declare\r\n\nthat  the  evidence had  no purpose  other  than to  suggest that\r\n\nColombians are prone to violence.\r\n\n          Similarly, Agent Semesky's  testimony was relevant  and\r\n\nappropriate  in  several respects.   First,  it  went a  long way\r\n\n                                37\r\r\n\ntoward explaining the  nature of money  laundering and the  basis\r\n\nfor appellant's activities.   This is a  perfectly legitimate use\r\n\nof evidence.   See  Doe, 903  F.2d at 19  &amp; n.21  (citing cases).\r                                 \r\n\nEven  the testimony about the  cartels' control over the American\r\n\ndrug trade  was relevant on  the issue  of whether the  cash that\r\n\nappellant  scrubbed  clean  was  in  fact  derived  from  illegal\r\n\nactivities.    The evidence  could  support  a jury's  plausible,\r\n\nthough circumstantial,  inference of  an illicit source  of funds\r\n\nbased  on  appellant's repeated  wire  transfers  of millions  of\r\n\ndollars in laundered  money to  a country that  functions as  the\r\n\nnerve center of the world's traffic in cocaine.\r\n\n          The  only remotely  problematic references  to Colombia\r\n\nare  those contained in the summation.  For example, a prosecutor\r\n\nstated:\r\n\n          [Agent  Semesky]  told   you  as  an  expert,\r\n          something  you  probably  already knew,  that\r\n          cocaine comes  from Colombia.  That  it's run\r\n          by cartels  in Colombia.  That  they ship the\r\n          money  up  here  and  it gets  out  into  the\r\n          streets.  That's the reason for all these ten\r\n          and twenty dollar bills.   These are grams of\r\n          coke . . . .\r\n\nLater  on, after  reminding  the jurors  that  the case  involved\r\n\nroughly $100,000,000 \"generated on  the streets of New  York that\r\n\nis  sent  back  to Colombia,\"  a  prosecutor  posed  a series  of\r\n\nrhetorical questions:\r\n\n          If  we're not talking about cocaine, what are\r\n          we  talking  about?    Is  this  from  coffee\r\n          vendors?   Is this  money coming from  people\r\n          out  in the streets selling Colombian coffee?\r\n          Oh, I  have  had  a  good day  today.    Five\r\n          hundred thousand dollars, unfortunately, it's\r\n          all  in twenty  dollar bills.   Think  of the\r\n\n                                38\r\r\n\n          change they  had to  give.   This  is a  case\r\n          about  Roberto  Juri  and  Tulio  Alzate  and\r\n          Fernando  Duenas  and Stephen  Saccoccia, not\r\n          Juan  Valdez,  ladies  and  gentlemen.    The\r\n          evidence in this case and the only reasonable\r\n          inference you can draw is drug money.\r\n\nAppellant did not interject a contemporaneous objection to any of\r\n\nthese comments.15\r\n\n          It  strains  credulity to  suggest, as  Saccoccia does,\r\n\nthat  the prosecution was arguing that only drugs and coffee come\r\n\nfrom Colombia.   The  remark about  coffee vendors was  obviously\r\n\nintended to  show the  unlikelihood that any  legitimate business\r\n\nwould generate the volume of cash that flowed through appellant's\r\n\noperation.  The  quip about Juan  Valdez,16 while an  unnecessary\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     15The closing argument also contained the following passage:\r\n\n          [W]e are asking you  to draw some  outrageous\r\n          innuendo that because people  are Colombians,\r\n          they are involved in cocaine.  The Government\r\n          simply is  not suggesting that.   What we are\r\n          suggesting  is based  on  the  evidence,  the\r\n          cocaine  comes from  Colombia.   Juan  Carlos\r\n          Garcia testified that he was born in Colombia\r\n          and Raoul  Escobar testified that he was born\r\n          in Colombia.   This  defendant went    on two\r\n          occasions  he  went  to  Colombia  to discuss\r\n          money-laundering   with   Tulio  Alzate   and\r\n          Roberto Juri.\r\n\nAlthough  we  cannot  tell  whether the  prosecutor  misspoke  or\r\nwhether  his remarks  were  mistranscribed, we  believe that  the\r\nfirst sentence contains  an error.   The overall  meaning of  the\r\npassage is clear  in urging the  jury not  to make a  prejudicial\r\ninference based solely on nationality.\r\n\n     16We take judicial notice that the fictional Juan Valdez  is\r\na  prominent persona in coffee advertisements.

This  mitigates one  of the  most serious  dangers of\r\n\nevidence  about a person's national  origin:  that  the jury will\r\n\nbelieve  the   defendant  is  guilty  because   of  stereotyping.\r\n\nAppellant has not cited any case in which a court  has reversed a\r\n\nconviction due  to evidence touching  upon a national  origin not\r\n\nshared by the  defendant.

At  trial Bosco's  handler, Sgt.  Edward\r\n\nConley, testified that he took Bosco to a bank in Cranston, Rhode\r\n\nIsland  on March 23, 1990.  Bosco \"searched\" several areas of the\r\n\nbank, such as  the vault and teller stations, and  did not react.\r\n\nConley then took Bosco to a room in which a bag containing $9,000\r\n\nwas located, and, when  he instructed Bosco to search  for drugs,\r\n\nthe  dog \"showed a strong, positive aggressive alert, shaking the\r\n\nbag,  ripping  it apart,  grabbing the  money  in his  mouth, and\r\n\nripping  the money.\"  According to Conley, a similar search, with\r\n\nsimilar results, took  place on  April 20, 1990,  at a  different\r\n\nbank in Johnston, Rhode  Island.  In each instance,  the currency\r\n\nto   which  Bosco  reacted  had  been  brought  to  the  bank  by\r\n\nappellant's associates in order to purchase cashier's checks.\r\n\n          To meet  this testimony,  appellant called  two experts\r\n\nwho attacked the reliability  of Bosco's response.  One  of these\r\n\nwitnesses,  Thomas  Knott, testified  that  the  manner in  which\r\n\nConley  orchestrated the  sniff  tests did  not properly  control\r\n\nagainst the possibility of a false alert.  The second expert, Dr.\r\n\nJames Woodford, criticized the testing protocol because the sniff\r\n\ntests were not verified  by chemical field tests.   Woodford also\r\n\ntestified  as to  the widespread  contamination of  United States\r\n\ncurrency  with illegal drugs and  the tenuous nature  of the link\r\n\nbetween a  canine alert and a conclusion that particular currency\r\n\nderived  from narcotics  trafficking (\"[I]f  there were  drugs on\r\n\n                                41\r\r\n\nthat money, it doesn't mean that it is drug money.\").18\r\n\n          Appellant insists  that the probative value  of the dog\r\n\nsniff  evidence  is substantially  outweighed by  its prejudicial\r\n\neffect,  and that the district court erred in refusing to exclude\r\n\nthe  evidence under  Fed.  R. Evid.  403.   This  claim  deserves\r\n\nserious attention,  for recent  decisions  about the  evidentiary\r\n\nvalue  of  a trained  dog's alert  to  currency are  not uniform.\r\n\nCompare,  e.g., United  States v.

See\r                                                                           \r\nJones v. DEA, 819 F. Supp. 698, 720 (M.D. Tenn. 1993) (citing DEA\r                      \r\nreport).  This criticism  is overblown.  The court  permitted the\r\nwitness to describe the report's conclusions and to indicate that\r\nhe  had  relied on  those  findings.    See  Fed.  R.

The court's decision\r\nto  preclude  attribution  of  the  report  was well  within  its\r\ndiscretion.    Moreover,  because  the report  was  available  to\r\nappellant despite the government's alleged failure to disclose it\r\nin a timeous manner, the  rule of Brady v.

Cir.  1992)\r                           \r\n(similar), those materials could  not inform the district court's\r\ndecision.   Cf. Carr,  25  F.3d at  1202 n.3  (declining to  take\r                              \r\njudicial  notice that  nearly  all currency  contains  detectable\r\ntraces of illegal narcotics).\r\n\n                                43\r\r\n\nalert still  retains some  probative value.   Ordinary experience\r\n\nsuggests that currency used to  purchase narcotics is more likely\r\n\nthan other currency to have come into contact  with drugs.  Here,\r\n\nmoreover,  the  evidence  supports  an  inference   that  Bosco's\r\n\nfrenzied  reaction  was  caused by  more  than  a  mere trace  of\r\n\ncontamination.\r\n\n          The  record contains corroboration of Bosco's olfactory\r\n\nevidence.  Several witnesses testified that ordinary human senses\r\n\ncould detect  something unusual about the  money that appellant's\r\n\nassociates  brought to the banks.   One teller  testified that he\r\n\noccasionally  noticed that  the money  felt \"dusty  . .  . almost\r\n\nfloury from pizza dough,  that type of feeling.\"   Another teller\r\n\nreported  that she noticed an odor or  fragrance, akin to that of\r\n\nan orchid.  This evidence, along with Conley's testimony that the\r\n\ndog did  not react in  other areas of  the banks, buttressed  the\r\n\nlower court's belief  that the dog  sniff evidence had  probative\r\n\nforce.\r\n\n          Conversely,  though  the   dog  sniff  evidence  likely\r\n\nbolstered  the prosecution's  case  and served  to inculpate  the\r\n\ndefendant, we are  not convinced that it  presented a substantial\r\n\nrisk of  unfair prejudice.  See  generally Rodriguez-Estrada, 877\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 156 (\"By design, all evidence is meant to be prejudicial;\r\n\nit is only unfair prejudice which must be avoided.\").  After all,\r                           \r\n\nthe court  allowed appellant  to call  two  expert witnesses  who\r\n\ndebunked Bosco's reaction to the currency.  If,  on one hand, the\r\n\njury believed the  experts, it doubtless discounted the  value of\r\n\n                                44\r\r\n\nthe canine alert.   If, on the  other hand, the jury  disbelieved\r\n\nappellant's  experts, it was entitled to place a greater value on\r\n\nthe  canine  sniff.    See, e.g.,  Quinones-Pacheco  v.  American\r                                                                           \r\n\nAirlines,  Inc., 979 F.2d 1,  5 (1st Cir.  1992) (explaining that\r                         \r\n\n\"expert opinion testimony, even  if not directly contradicted, is\r\n\nnot ordinarily binding on a jury\").\r\n\n          In any event, considering  the high degree of deference\r\n\nwe owe to a district court's balancing of probative value against\r\n\nunfairly prejudicial effects, see  Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n156,  we  cannot  say  that  the  trial  court  abused  its  wide\r\n\ndiscretion in admitting  the evidence of Bosco's  reaction to the\r\n\ncurrency delivered by appellant's associates.\r\n\n               D.

Garcia said that in 1987, while living in the\r\n\nUnited States, he began  working for his brother-in-law, Fernando\r\n\nDuenas.   Following  Duenas'  orders, Garcia  would respond  when\r\n\npaged on his beeper, arrange to  retrieve a quantity of cash, and\r\n\ndeposit  the money  in one  of several  bank accounts  maintained\r\n\nunder the  names of Duenas,  Duenas' wife  (Garcia's sister),  or\r\n\nDuenas' brother.  By the end of 1987 the cash had mushroomed from\r\n\n$10,000-$20,000 per shipment to $150,000-$200,000 per shipment.\r\n\n          Garcia met  appellant for the  first time in  May 1989.\r\n\nWith Duenas' blessing,  the two men  agreed that appellant  would\r\n\naccept  bundles of  cash  from  Garcia  and  send  the  money  to\r\n\n                                45\r\r\n\nColombia.  On countless  occasions thereafter, appellant received\r\n\nmoney from  Garcia and  redirected it  to accounts  controlled by\r\n\nDuenas.\r\n\n          At trial,  the  district court  permitted Garcia,  over\r\n\nobjection, to testify  that, in 1988, Duenas told him  that a man\r\n\nnamed  \"Caesar\" would  call  and give  him  something other  than\r\n\nmoney.   Garcia knew Caesar  because Caesar had  brought money to\r\n\nhim  on a previous occasion.   Caesar called  and informed Garcia\r\n\nthat he would be delivering a kilogram of cocaine.  Subsequently,\r\n\nCaesar  handed  Garcia a  shopping bag  containing  a block  of a\r\n\ngranular substance, beige  in color.   Garcia tried  to sell  the\r\n\nmerchandise, as directed  by Duenas, but he was  unable to do so.\r\n\nHe  eventually delivered  the  package to  another individual  on\r\n\nDuenas' instructions.\r\n\n          Appellant assigns error to  the trial court's admission\r\n\nof the testimony anent the package.   The assignment of error has\r\n\ntwin  foci:  (1) the conversations between Duenas and Garcia, and\r\n\n(2) Caesar's  assurance  that the  package  contained  cocaine.20\r\n\nWe believe that the court lawfully admitted the evidence.\r\n\n          The  Evidence  Rules provide  that  \"a  statement by  a\r\n\ncoconspirator  of a party during the course and in furtherance of\r\n\nthe  conspiracy\"  is not  considered  hearsay.

By\r\n\njoining that  conspiracy at  a later date,  appellant effectively\r\n\nadopted  coconspirator declarations previously  made.

For one thing,  we have held\r\n\nthat  \"when a  number of  people combine efforts  to manufacture,\r\n\ndistribute and retail narcotics, there is  a single conspiracy, a\r\n\n`chain conspiracy,' despite the fact that some of the individuals\r\n\nlinking the conspiracy  together have not been  in direct contact\r\n\nwith others in the chain.\"  United States v. Rivera-Santiago, 872\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  1073, 1080 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 492  U.S. 910 (1989).\r                                                    \r\n\nFor another thing, money laundering and narcotics trafficking are\r\n\nsymbiotic  activities, each  of which  may require  the  other in\r\n\norder  to  continue.   Duenas' efforts  to  have Garcia  sell the\r\n\ncocaine for him and the group's ongoing campaign to launder money\r\n\ncan rationally be  seen as  adjacent links in  the lengthy  chain\r\n\nthat binds  up  the  narcotics  trafficking  cycle.    Thus,  the\r\n\n                                47\r\r\n\ndistrict court  acted within its proper province  in deeming both\r\n\nactivities part of the  same conspiracy, and in holding  that the\r\n\nattempted narcotics sale was in furtherance of it.  Consequently,\r\n\nthe  challenged  statements  were  properly  admitted under  Rule\r\n\n801(d)(2)(E).\r\n\n          We note,  moreover, as did  the district court,  that a\r\n\nstatement made  by an  unavailable declarant21 falls  outside the\r\n\nhearsay exclusion if the statement \"at the time of its making . .\r\n\n. so far  tended to subject  the declarant to  civil or  criminal\r\n\nliability  .  . .  that a  reasonable  person in  the declarant's\r\n\nposition would not have made the statement unless believing it to\r\n\nbe  true.\"    Fed. R.  Evid.  804(b)(3).    Duenas' and  Caesar's\r\n\nstatements to Garcia were tantamount to admissions that they were\r\n\ndealing  cocaine.    Because  such statements  were  against  the\r\n\ndeclarants' penal  interest, they  came within the  encincture of\r\n\nRule 804(b)(3) and were admissible on that basis.\r\n\n          Finally,  appellant's suggestion that  the admission of\r\n\nGarcia's testimony abridged the Confrontation Clause is off base.\r\n\nIt  is  well settled  that a  statement  falling within  a firmly\r\n\nrooted  hearsay  exception  will  not  be  held  to  violate  the\r\n\nConfrontation  Clause.   See  Ohio v.  Roberts,  448 U.S.  56, 66\r                                                        \r\n\n(1980); Puleio v.

DEA  Special Agent James Shedd participated\r\n\nin  this reverse  sting  operation (dubbed  \"Operation  Pisces\").\r\n\nDuenas dealt with the Pisces network in 1987 and 1988.  At trial,\r\n\na prosecutor suggested that Shedd would testify as follows:  \"Mr.\r\n\nDuenas told him that ninety-nine percent of the money that he was\r\n\nturning over to the  undercover agent was, in fact,  drug money.\"\r\n\nOn the basis  of this  representation, the lower  court denied  a\r\n\nmotion in limine by  which the defense sought to  exclude Shedd's\r                          \r\n\ntestimony  regarding Duenas'  statements.   Shedd  told the  jury\r\n\nabout thirty-seven  transactions in  which  Duenas supplied  cash\r\n\nthat  the DEA undercover operation laundered for him.  Shedd also\r\n\ndescribed  several  conversations  with Duenas  in  which  Duenas\r\n\nreportedly  said  that  he  laundered money  for  Colombian  drug\r\n\ntraffickers  and  \"that ninety-nine  percent  of  the money  that\r\n\nmoney-launderers deal in Bogota comes from narcotics proceeds.\"\r\n\n          During    cross-examination,     appellant's    counsel\r\n\n                                49\r\r\n\nchallenged  Shedd  about  this   statement.    Shedd  and  Duenas\r\n\nconversed in  Spanish, and some  of their conversations  had been\r\n\nrecorded.   Defense counsel called Shedd's  attention to one such\r\n\nconversation.   The  translation indicated  that Duenas  made the\r\n\ncontested comment during a discussion in which he explained that,\r\n\nalthough  it  was against  the  law,  foreign currency  routinely\r\n\ncirculated in Colombia.   He apparently  added:  \"Logically,  the\r\n\n[foreign] currency that  circulates the most over there .  . . is\r\n\nthe dollar . . . which  ninety-nine percent of it comes from drug\r\n\ndealing.\"   Shedd  responded that his  direct testimony  had been\r\n\npremised not on a single discussion, but on an overall impression\r\n\ngained  from a  lengthy  conversation with  Duenas.22   Appellant\r\n\nthen  moved to strike Shedd's testimony.  Judge Torres denied the\r\n\nmotion.\r\n\n          Appellant  maintains that  the district  court made  no\r\n\nfewer than four errors in connection with this testimony.  First,\r\n\nappellant  posits  that Duenas'  statements  were  barred by  the\r\n\nhearsay rule.   This  claim fails.   The court  was warranted  in\r\n\nfinding  that these  were  coconspirator declarations  and, thus,\r\n\nadmissible  under Rule  801(d)(2)(E).   See, e.g.,  Sepulveda, 15\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d at 1180; Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 714-15.\r                             \r\n\n          Appellant's   second   contention   is   that   Duenas'\r\n\nstatement,  in  its  true  form, was  irrelevant  because  it was\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     22Shedd also offered the following syllogism:   \"Ninety-nine\r\npercent of  the money, of the U.S.  dollars that's in Colombia is\r\ndrug  money.  He's a money launderer, then ninety-nine percent of\r\nthe money that he launders comes from drug money.\"\r\n\n                                50\r\r\n\nnothing  more than  a  gross generalization  about the  Colombian\r\n\neconomy.   We  disagree.   Though courts  are sometimes  cautious\r\n\nabout admitting abstract data as proof of what  actually happened\r\n\nin an individual case, a percentage like \"ninety-nine percent\" is\r\n\nquite powerful, and far surpasses the usual test that evidence is\r\n\nrelevant if  it has \"any  tendency to make  the existence  of any\r\n\nfact  that is of consequence  to the determination  of the action\r\n\nmore  probable  or less  probable than  it  would be  without the\r\n\nevidence.\"  Fed.

Duenas'  remark,\r\n\neven in the diluted form  that was heralded on cross-examination,\r\n\nhas at  least some probative  value in  ascertaining whether  the\r\n\ndrug trade was  the source  of the funds  that appellant  washed,\r\n\nmuch as the  fact that a lake is  contaminated has some probative\r\n\nvalue in ascertaining  whether a  stream that feeds  the lake  is\r\n\ncontaminated.\r\n\n          Appellant's  third  sally  alleges  error   in  Shedd's\r\n\n                                51\r\r\n\nexplanation that  his initial  testimony about  Duenas' statement\r\n\nwas  based  on  an  overall  impression  from  several  hours  of\r\n\nconversation.   Although a witness is  generally not permitted to\r\n\ntestify  about his  subjective interpretations  of what  has been\r\n\nsaid by another person, he may do so if his opinion is rationally\r\n\nbased on his perception and is helpful either to an understanding\r\n\nof his testimony or to the determination of a fact in issue.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States  v.

In this case, we conclude that the\r                \r\n\ndistrict court acted lawfully in leaving the testimony intact.\r\n\n          Shedd tendered his explanation of Duenas'  statement in\r\n\ndirect response  to a question  by appellant's counsel  on cross-\r\n\nexamination.  The answer  was not followed by a  timely objection\r\n\nor  motion  to  strike.     While  appellant  challenged  Shedd's\r\n\nqualifications to offer an opinion about Duenas' state of mind in\r\n\na subsequent  motion to strike,  this was  too late.   See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

The  proper time to have  registered an\r\n\nobjection  to Shedd's  explanation was  immediately after  it was\r\n\nuttered.  Accordingly,  any objection to the explanation has been\r\n\nwaived.  And, moreover, even if the court erred in permitting the\r\n\nanswer to stand,  it looms  as harmless beyond  all doubt in  the\r\n\ncontext of a very efficacious cross-examination.\r\n\n          Appellant's  final contention  is that  the prosecution\r\n\n                                52\r\r\n\nknowingly offered  Shedd's testimony despite having  a transcript\r\n\nthat refuted it, and, to make a bad situation worse, deliberately\r\n\nwithheld  the  transcript from  the  defense.   Having  carefully\r\n\nexamined the record, we find no valid reason to conclude that the\r\n\nprosecution   intentionally  mischaracterized   Shedd's  proposed\r\n\ntestimony  during  the  in   limine  hearing,  and  no  hint   of\r                                             \r\n\nprosecutorial misconduct in the  handling of the transcript.   At\r\n\nany rate, it is perfectly clear that defense counsel obtained the\r\n\nunexpurgated transcript in ample time to conduct a very effective\r\n\ncross-examination on  the following day.  There  was no prejudice\r\n\nand, hence, no reversible error.  See Devin, 918 F.2d at 290.\r                                                     \r\n\n                      F.

The tapes  are not entirely\r\n\naudible,  and the parties disagree about what was said during two\r\n\npotentially  significant conversations.   The  government asserts\r\n\nthat, in a discussion that took place at Trend's offices, Kenneth\r\n\nSaccoccio  referred to cash that  he and Hurley  were counting as\r\n\n\"fuckin'  drug money.\"  Appellant claims that this portion of the\r\n\ntape  was  inaudible.    The  other  conversation  took place  at\r\n\nSaccoccia  Coin Company.  In it, Stanley Cirella spoke to Stephen\r\n\nPizzo about an ongoing investigation of appellant's organization.\r\n\nAccording  to the  government,  Cirella declared  that  \"he\"    a\r\n\npronoun that we take in context to refer to Saccoccia    had told\r\n\nhim that \"they [the authorities] ain't doin' this [conducting the\r\n\n                                53\r\r\n\ninvestigation] because of the coke, they're doin' this because of\r\n\nthe  washing of  money.\"   Appellant contends  that Cirella  said\r\n\n\"gold\" rather than \"coke.\"\r\n\n          The  issue  on appeal  is  whether  the district  court\r\n\nabused its discretion in allowing  the taped conversations to  be\r\n\npresented  to  the  jury  in conjunction  with  the  government's\r\n\ntranscript.  In appellant's  view, the inaudible portions  of the\r\n\ntapes are  so critical as to  make the rest more  misleading than\r\n\nhelpful.  See United States v.

What  was  or  was  not  said  during  a  tape-recorded\r\n\nconversation  is ordinarily a question of fact, not a question of\r\n\nlaw.\r\n\n          Appellant's  fallback  position is  that,  even  if the\r\n\ngovernment accurately  transcribed  the tapes,  the  lower  court\r\n\nerred in failing  to tell the jury that any  statements about the\r\n\nsource of the laundered money were relevant only to the speakers'\r\n\nsubjective beliefs.  This position hinges on the premise that, in\r\n\nthe  absence of  a  concinnous foundation  showing the  speakers'\r\n\nknowledge, the comments cannot constitute proof vis-a-vis Stephen\r\n\nSaccoccia  (who  did  not participate  in  the  discourse)  as to\r\n\nwhether the money in fact emanated from drug transactions.\r\n\n          We disagree  with appellant's premise  for two reasons.\r\n\n                                54\r\r\n\nFirst, Evidence  Rule 104(b) provides that  \"[w]hen the relevancy\r\n\nof  evidence depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact,\r\n\nthe court shall admit it upon, or subject to, the introduction of\r\n\nevidence sufficient to  support a finding  of the fulfillment  of\r\n\nthe  condition.\"   In addressing  foundational issues,  the trial\r\n\njudge acts as a  gatekeeper, examining the evidence and  deciding\r\n\n\"whether  the jury could reasonably find the conditional fact . .\r\n\n.  by a  preponderance of  the evidence.\"   Huddleston  v.

The men\r\n\nwho  made   the  statements   were   substantially  involved   in\r\n\nappellant's operation and could  easily have had opportunities to\r\n\nlearn of the money's origins.\r\n\n          As we  have  indicated, there  is a  second reason  why\r\n\nappellant is mistaken insofar as he sees personal knowledge about\r\n\nthe  source  of   the  funds   as  a   prerequisite  to   general\r\n\nadmissibility  of the  comments.   Both  statements were  made by\r\n\n                                55\r\r\n\ncoconspirators  and  are  thus  admissible  under  Evidence  Rule\r\n\n801(d)(2)(E) without a showing of personal knowledge.

That  the  waves  of cold  cash\r\n\ntypically appeared in well-worn bills of small denomination makes\r\n\nthe  tie tighter.  Then,  too, the jury  heard competent evidence\r\n\nthat  Duenas,  who  furnished  money for  appellant  to  launder,\r\n\nhimself  performed monetary  ablutions for  narcotics traffickers\r\n\n(and,  on one  occasion,  supplied cocaine  for  an associate  to\r\n\nsell).  The canine alert to  currency that appellant's associates\r\n\nhad gathered furnished some added support for the theory that the\r\n\nmoney  emanated  from  drug  sales.    Finally,  appellant's  own\r\n\nemployees suggested  on two occasions that the  washed funds were\r\n\nlinked to narcotics.\r\n\n          Taken in the ensemble, these pieces of evidence provide\r\n\nan  adequate foundation on which  the jury could  build a finding\r\n\nthat  appellant laundered drug money.  Jurors, after all, are not\r\n\nexpected to resist commonsense  inferences based on the realities\r\n\nof human  experience.

FORFEITURE\r          V.  FORFEITURE\r\n\n          The  court bifurcated appellant's trial, separating the\r\n\nsubstantive   criminal  charges   from  the   forfeiture  claims.\r\n\nAppellant waived his right to trial by jury on the latter counts.\r\n\nAll  counsel  assured  the  judge  that they  had  no  additional\r\n\nevidence  to present at the second anticipated phase of the trial\r\n\n                                57\r\r\n\nand, therefore, that the hearing on forfeiture would \"be purely a\r\n\nmatter  of legal  argument.\"   Accordingly,  the judge  scheduled\r\n\narguments for March 26, 1993.\r\n\n          On the assigned date, appellant was before a California\r\n\ncourt in connection with a separate action.  His counsel objected\r\n\nto proceeding in appellant's  absence.  See Herring v.  New York,\r                                                                          \r\n\n422   U.S.  853,   863-65   (1975)   (remarking   a   defendant's\r\n\nconstitutional  right to make a closing argument, even in a bench\r\n\ntrial); Fed. R. Crim.  P. 43(a) (\"The defendant shall  be present\r\n\nat  . . . every stage of the trial including . . . the imposition\r\n\nof sentence  . . . .\").  Specifically, counsel stated that (1) he\r\n\nrequired appellant's assistance \"in  responding to whatever it is\r\n\nthe government may say  about the evidence as  it relates to  the\r\n\nlaw that's going to be  argued,\" and (2) appellant might wish  to\r\n\nexercise his right to  make a closing statement.   The court then\r\n\noffered to proceed on  the understanding that appellant's counsel\r\n\ncould make incremental arguments  at the sentencing hearing, with\r\n\nappellant  present.23   When  counsel persisted  in his  original\r\n\nposition, the court terminated the session.\r\n\n          The  disposition  hearing was  held  on  May 12,  1993.\r\n\nAppellant was present throughout.   The district court determined\r\n\nthat he should forfeit all the money laundered during the life of\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     23Noting that forfeiture is  part of the sentencing process,\r\nand that  Saccoccia would  be present  for sentencing,  the court\r\nsuggested to defense counsel  that \"to the extent  the sentencing\r\nincludes  the potential for forfeiture order, you can be heard on\r\nthat issue  just as you  would on any  other sentencing issue  at\r\nthat time.\"\r\n\n                                58\r\r\n\nthe conspiracy,  and, using  bank  records, fixed  the amount  at\r\n\n$136,344,231.86.   See United States  v. Saccoccia, 823  F. Supp.\r                                                            \r\n\n994, 1006 (D.R.I. 1993).   At the government's urging,  the court\r\n\nsubsequently  amended the forfeiture  order to specify substitute\r\n\nassets for forfeiture.24  See 18 U.S.C.   1963(m) (1988).\r                                       \r\n\n          Appellant assigns  error.   He strives to  persuade us,\r\n\ninter   alia,  that   applicable  extradition   doctrines  barred\r                      \r\n\nforfeiture; that the court ignored the strictures of due process;\r\n\nand  that the  forfeiture order swept  too broadly.   We  are not\r\n\nconvinced.\r\n\n                   A.  Extradition/Forfeiture.\r                             A.  Extradition/Forfeiture.\r                                                       \r\n\n          Appellant asserts  that the forfeiture  entered against\r\n\nhim  violates the rule of  specialty because it  is tantamount to\r\n\nprosecution and  conviction for  an offense on  which extradition\r\n\nwas  neither sought  nor  granted.   He  also suggests  that  the\r\n\nprinciple of  dual criminality  prohibits the  forfeiture because\r\n\nSwiss law  does  not render  a  defendant criminally  liable  for\r\n\nforfeiture  by  reason  of   unlawful  money  transfers.    These\r\n\ninitiatives fail because they ignore the irresistible  conclusion\r\n\nthat, at  least for  present purposes,  criminal forfeiture  is a\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     24In   discussing   substitutions,   Saccoccia    seeks   to\r\nincorporate by reference his  codefendants' plaint that the court\r\nimproperly  allowed the  government  to add  property subject  to\r\nforfeiture  while the  cases  were on  appeal.   We  reject  this\r\nremonstrance.   The district court did not  \"amend\" its judgment,\r\nbut, rather, ordered forfeiture  of substitute assets based on  a\r\nsupportable  finding  that  appellant  had  transferred forfeited\r\nproceeds  beyond  the jurisdiction  of  the court.    Contrary to\r\nappellant's  intimation,  this  procedure   did  not  insult  his\r\nconstitutional entitlement to  due process, nor did it  run afoul\r\nof the Double Jeopardy Clause.\r\n\n                                59\r\r\n\npunishment, not a separate criminal offense.\r\n\n          We  think   that  the  genealogy  of   modern  criminal\r\n\nforfeiture is important.  The device is born out of the mating of\r\n\ntwo  historically  distinct  traditions.   One  parent  is  civil\r\n\nforfeiture,  an  in  rem  proceeding rooted  in  the  notion that\r                                  \r\n\nproperty   used  in,  or  intimately  associated  with,  criminal\r\n\nactivity acquires a  taint, and that  such property is  therefore\r\n\nforfeitable  even  if not  owned by  the  miscreant.   See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Sandini, 816 F.2d 869,  872 (3d Cir. 1987).  The second\r                           \r\n\nparent   is  old-hat  criminal  forfeiture,  which  traditionally\r\n\noperated  as  an incident  of  a  felony conviction  in  personam\r                                                                           \r\n\nagainst  a  convicted defendant,  requiring  him  to forfeit  his\r\n\nproperty to the crown.

Consequently, a  defendant  may  be\r\n\nsubjected  to  a forfeiture  order  even if  extradition  was not\r\n\nspecifically granted  in respect  to the  forfeiture allegations.\r\n\nWe base this  ruling primarily on  three pillars:  the  weight of\r\n\nauthority  counsels in  this direction;  the punitive  aspects of\r\n\ncriminal   forfeiture  predominate  (among   other  things,  RICO\r\n\nforfeiture retains the functional traits of a punishment since it\r\n\nis  definitively imposed  only  after the  defendant's guilt  has\r\n\notherwise  been  determined);  and,  finally,  treating  criminal\r\n\nforfeiture  as   a  punishment  in  the   extradition  milieu  is\r\n\nconsistent  with   the  emphasis   that  the  doctrine   of  dual\r\n\ncriminality  places  on  the  unlawfulness   of  the  defendant's\r\n\nconduct,  and, correspondingly,  on the  lack of  any requirement\r\n\nthat  a crime  have identical  elements or  penalties in  the two\r\n\njurisdictions,  see Collins, 259 U.S.  at 312; Levy,  905 F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n328.\r\n\n          It  follows, therefore,  that  appellant  was  properly\r\n\nsubjected  to  a criminal  forfeiture order  even  if he  was not\r\n\nextradited on forfeiture charges  and even if Swiss law  does not\r\n\nprovide for criminal forfeiture under comparable circumstances.\r\n\n                     B.  Procedural Aspects.\r                               B.  Procedural Aspects.\r                                                     \r\n\n                                62\r\r\n\n          Appellant  also  declaims that  the  procedure employed\r\n\nwith  regard  to  the  forfeiture  order  deprived  him  of  four\r\n\nintertwined rights:  the right to present a closing argument, the\r\n\nright  to  be  present  to  assist  counsel  during  the  closing\r\n\nargument, the right to entry of  a verdict of forfeiture, and the\r\n\nright to  be present  for entry  of a verdict.   This  quadrat of\r\n\ncomplaints is unavailing.\r\n\n          The  first  two grievances  are  not  supported by  the\r\n\nrecord.  Even though appellant was absent on March 26,  the court\r\n\noffered his counsel the opportunity to make further arguments  at\r\n\nthe disposition  hearing (at which appellant  was in attendance).\r\n\nAffording appellant this opportunity  satisfied his right to make\r\n\na  closing statement and his  right personally to assist counsel.\r\n\nThe  fact  that  appellant chose  not  to  avail  himself of  the\r\n\nafforded opportunity is beside the point.\r\n\n          Appellant's next contention arises out of the idea that\r\n\nthe  court violated Fed. R. Crim.  P. 32(b) and 31(e) by ordering\r\n\nforfeiture without entering a special verdict.  Because appellant\r\n\ndid not object  to the district court's decision to  make an oral\r\n\nforfeiture  order followed  by a  written decision,  however, our\r\n\nreview is limited to a hunt for plain error.   See  United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

But, Rule 31(a)  makes it transpicuously\r\n\n                                63\r\r\n\nclear that this  requirement is geared to jury  trials.  See Fed.\r                                                                      \r\n\nR. Crim. P. 31(a) (stating that the verdict \"shall be returned by\r\n\nthe jury to  the judge in  open court\").   When the judge is  the\r\n\nfactfinder,  the procedure for  making factual  determinations is\r\n\ngoverned by Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(c).  That rule provides:\r\n\n          In  a case  tried  without a  jury the  court\r\n          shall  make  a general  finding and  shall in\r\n          addition,  on request made before the general\r\n          finding,  find  the  facts specially.    Such\r\n          findings  may  be oral.    If  an opinion  or\r\n          memorandum of  decision is filed,  it will be\r\n          sufficient  if the  findings  of fact  appear\r\n          therein.\r\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 23(c).\r\n\n          In the instant case,  the judge entered an  oral order,\r\n\nfollowed  very  shortly  by  a  written  memorandum  limning  his\r\n\nfindings  of  fact.   In  our  opinion,  this  procedure did  not\r\n\nconstitute plain  error.  See, e.g., Gibbs  v. Buck, 307 U.S. 66,\r                                                             \r\n\n78 (1939); see also Aoude  v. Mobil Oil Corp., 862 F.2d  890, 895\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1988)  (observing  that reversal  \"would  be an  empty\r\n\nritual\"  once the lower court had remedied its original error and\r\n\nbelatedly  made written  findings).   Thus,  we deny  appellant's\r\n\nrequest that the forfeiture order be vacated on this score.\r\n\n                  C.  Extent of the Forfeiture.\r                            C.

He does  not\r\n\ndwell  on  this  thesis,  instead  electing  to  incorporate  the\r\n\ncodefendants'  argument to this effect.   We, too,  prefer not to\r\n\nlinger.  The  district court treated  this contention at  length,\r\n\n                                64\r\r\n\nand we find ourselves in substantial agreement with the reasoning\r\n\nexplicated  in that court's opinion.  See Saccoccia, 823 F. Supp.\r                                                             \r\n\nat 1001-03.\r\n\nVI.  SENTENCING\r          VI.  SENTENCING\r\n\n          Without  objection, the  district court  predicated its\r\n\nsentencing calculations  on the November  1, 1992 edition  of the\r\n\nfederal   sentencing  guidelines.26     See   United   States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nHarotunian,  920 F.2d 1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"Barring any\r                    \r\n\nex post facto problem, a defendant is to be punished according to\r\n\nthe guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing.\").  The court\r\n\ncompiled  appellant's criminal  history score  and placed  him in\r\n\ncategory II.   Turning to the  other side of the  grid, the court\r\n\nstarted with the money laundering guideline.  Since appellant had\r\n\nbeen convicted under  18 U.S.C.    1956(a)(2)(A), he  had a  base\r\n\noffense level (BOL) of 23.  See U.S.S.G.  2S1.1(a)(1).  The court\r                                         \r\n\nthen added 13  levels because  the value of  the laundered  funds\r\n\nexceeded $100,000,000, see id.  2S1.1(b)(2)(N),  and three levels\r                                        \r\n\npremised  on a finding that appellant knew (or believed) that the\r\n\nfunds were  derived from  narcotics sales, see  id.  2S1.1(b)(1).\r                                                             \r\n\nFinding appellant to  be the  organizer and leader  of the  money\r\n\nlaundering enterprise, the court  escalated four levels  pursuant\r\n\nto U.S.S.G.  3B1.1(a).   Finally, citing appellant's unsuccessful\r\n\nattempt to use  his medical history as a  device for extracting a\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     26In large part, the district judge adopted the calculations\r\nrecommended by the probation  department.  We concentrate  on how\r\nthe court arrived at the guideline sentencing range (GSR), and do\r\nnot differentiate  between the judge's original  thinking and his\r\nacceptance of the probation department's ideas.\r\n\n                                65\r\r\n\ncontinuance,  see supra  note 2, and  stressing that  the feigned\r                                 \r\n\nillness occurred  shortly after the court  had denied appellant's\r\n\nrequest for  postponement of the  trial on  other grounds,  Judge\r\n\nTorres  went up two levels for obstructing justice.  See U.S.S.G.\r                                                                  \r\n\n 3C1.1.  These calculations yielded an adjusted  offense level of\r\n\n45 for the money laundering counts.\r\n\n          The  court then  turned to  the RICO  conspiracy count.\r\n\nInasmuch as the applicable  guideline, id.  2E1.1, prescribes the\r                                                    \r\n\nuse  of an  offense  level equal  to  the greater  of  19 or  the\r\n\nadjusted offense  level for  the underlying conduct  (here, money\r\n\nlaundering),   appellant's   adjusted   offense  level   remained\r\n\nunchanged.   The  court took  a  similar look  at the  Travel Act\r\n\ncounts with a similar  result (the applicable guideline, U.S.S.G.\r\n\n 2E1.2, directs the use of an offense level  equal to the greater\r\n\nof 6 or the  adjusted offense level for the  underlying conduct).\r\n\nAt the bottom  line, then,  the counts of  conviction produced  a\r\n\ntotal offense level (TOL) of 45.  See id.   3D1.2(d), 3D1.3(b).\r                                                   \r\n\n          A  TOL of  43 or  higher requires  the imposition  of a\r\n\nsentence  of  life  imprisonment  regardless  of  the  offender's\r\n\ncriminal   history   category.27     See   U.S.S.G.  Ch.5,   Pt.A\r                                                  \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     27The  Sentencing Commission recently  submitted to Congress\r\nproposed guideline  amendments that  apparently would  reduce the\r\nsentence mandated for conduct of the  kind at issue here.  See 60\r                                                                        \r\nFed.  Reg. 25,074, 25,085-86  (1995).  The  proposed changes will\r\nbecome effective on November 1, 1995, absent congressional action\r\nto the contrary.  See 28  U.S.C.   994(p) (1988).  The Commission\r                               \r\nhas  not yet  decided whether  the changes,  if they  become law,\r\nshould  apply retrospectively.   See 60 Fed. Reg.  at 25,074.  If\r                                              \r\nthe amendments  are eventually determined to  warrant retroactive\r\napplication,  appellant  may  then  be  in  a  position  to  seek\r\nappropriate relief in the  district court.  See United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\n                                66\r\r\n\n(Sentencing Table).  However, the offenses of conviction in  this\r\n\ncase all carry  maximum sentences  less than life.   When, as  in\r\n\nthis  instance,   the  maximum  sentence  for   each  offense  of\r\n\nconviction  is lower than the  minimum punishment mandated by the\r\n\napplicable GSR, the guidelines require imposition of  consecutive\r\n\nsentences \"to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence\r\n\nequal  to the total punishment.\"   Id.  5G1.2(d).   Applying this\r                                                \r\n\nprinciple,  the district  court concluded  that sentences  on the\r\n\nseveral  counts of  conviction  should run  consecutively to  the\r\n\nextent necessary  to effectuate  a  life sentence.   Because  the\r\n\nsentencing guidelines  prescribe life in prison  for persons who,\r\n\nlike appellant,  sport a  TOL of 43  or higher,  whereas all  the\r\n\ncounts of convictions have statutory maxima that are expressed in\r\n\nterms of a finite number of years, the  court imposed the longest\r\n\npossible sentence on each count and ran the sentences consecutive\r\n\nto one  another.  The result:   an incarcerative sentence  of 660\r\n\nyears.28\r\n\n          Appellant  assails this  sentence on  manifold grounds.\r\n\nHis principal  lines of attack are that  mandatory life sentences\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nConnell, 960 F.2d 191, 197 n.10 (1st Cir. 1992); United States v.\r                                                                        \r\nMiller, 903 F.2d 341, 349 (5th Cir. 1990).  We express no opinion\r                \r\non the  subject,  but merely  note  the possibility  and  proceed\r\nwithout further reference to what the future may bring.\r\n\n     28The district  court imposed  this type of  sentence rather\r\nthan attempting to  estimate the length  of appellant's life  and\r\nthen fashioning a sentence of corresponding duration.  We find no\r\nfault  with this approach.  Despite the superficial severity of a\r\n660-year  sentence,  it  is  neither  more   nor  less  than  the\r\nfunctional  equivalent of  life  without parole.    We treat  the\r\nsentence  in this light  in evaluating its  correctness under the\r\nguidelines and its harshness for Eighth Amendment purposes.\r\n\n                                67\r\r\n\nunder  the  guidelines  are  illegal;  that  the  district  court\r\n\nmisconceived its  authority in imposing sentence;  that the court\r\n\nviolated  the Ex Post  Facto Clause; and that  the court erred in\r\n\nmaking an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice.\r\n\n                 A.  The Mandatory Life Sentence.\r                           A.  The Mandatory Life Sentence.\r                                                          \r\n\n          Appellant contends that  the imposition of  a mandatory\r\n\nlife  sentence  is  illegal   both  because  Congress   disavowed\r\n\nconsecutive sentences and because, in all events, a life sentence\r\n\nin the circumstances of this  case insults the Eighth Amendment's\r\n\nproscription against  cruel and  unusual punishment.   Neither of\r\n\nthese contentions is convincing.\r\n\n          1.   Congressional Intent.   It is  apodictic that  the\r                    1.   Congressional Intent.\r                                             \r\n\nsentencing  guidelines cannot  sweep more broadly  than Congress'\r\n\ngrant  of power to the Sentencing Commission permits.  See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v. Cooper, 962 F.2d 339, 342 (4th Cir. 1992).  Thus, if a\r                           \r\n\nguideline conflicts with  a statute,  the latter  prevails.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nStinson v. United States, 113 S. Ct. 1913, 1918-19 (1993); United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Fiore, 983 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113\r                                                                      \r\n\nS. Ct. 1830 (1993).   Appellant perceives such a  collision here.\r\n\nIn his view, Congress mandated  a strong statutory preference for\r\n\nconcurrent sentences, and the Sentencing Commission's instruction\r\n\nthat  fixed-year sentences  should  be  imposed consecutively  to\r\n\neffectuate life imprisonment, see  U.S.S.G.  5G1.2(d), must yield\r                                           \r\n\nthe right of way to Congress' expressed preference.\r\n\n          Appellant hinges this conclusion on Congress' enactment\r\n\nof two  statutory provisions,  namely, 28 U.S.C.     994(l)(2)  &amp;\r\n\n                                68\r\r\n\n994(v) (1988).  We  think he reads  the cited statutes with  much\r\n\ntoo sanguine an eye.  Neither statute prohibits the imposition of\r\n\nconsecutive sentences.  Rather, section 994(l)(2) merely declares\r\n\nthe  \"general inappropriateness\" of  consecutive sentences  for a\r\n\nconspiracy  and its  object  offense, and  section 994(v)  merely\r\n\ndirects   the  Commission   to  \"limit[]  consecutive   terms  of\r\n\nimprisonment\"  for convictions  on related  general  and specific\r\n\noffenses.29    While  these  statutes arguably  imply  a  general\r                                                                           \r\n\ncongressional preference  for concurrent sentences, they  do not,\r\n\nas  appellant intimates,  outlaw consecutive  sentences.   On the\r\n\ncontrary,  the statutory  scheme  leaves ample  room for  courts,\r\n\nfollowing  the  lead  of  the Sentencing  Commission,  to  deploy\r\n\nconsecutive sentences in appropriate circumstances.\r\n\n          Two observations show the virtual inevitability of this\r\n\nconclusion.  In the first place, U.S.S.G.  5G1.2 became effective\r\n\nonly  with the  consent  of Congress.   We  consider  this to  be\r\n\npowerful  evidence  that  Congress  itself saw  no  inconsistency\r\n\nbetween the  guideline provision and  the statutory scheme.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v. Luedecke, 908 F.2d 230, 233 (7th Cir. 1990).  In\r                                   \r\n\nthe  second  place,  Congress  minced  no  words  in  ceding  the\r\n\nCommission discretion to  determine what particular circumstances\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     29To the extent appellant's argument  is based on a  claimed\r\ncongressional preference for  concurrent sentences in  connection\r\nwith conspiracy and its  object offenses, and in connection  with\r\ngeneral  and  specific  offenses,  the  36  consecutive  ten-year\r\nsentences imposed for separate violations of 18 U.S.C.   1957 are\r\nunaffected.  These sentences total 360 years.  Barring a lifespan\r\nof  biblical proportions,  appellant's time  on this  mortal coil\r\nwill not exceed so lengthy an interval.\r\n\n                                69\r\r\n\nwould  trigger the need for consecutive sentences.

Because  Congress gave\r\n\nthe  Sentencing  Commission  expansive  authority  to  promulgate\r\n\nguidelines  specifying when  sentences  should be  consecutive or\r\n\nconcurrent,  and then directed sentencing  courts to refer to the\r\n\nguidelines in  order to determine whether  \"multiple sentences to\r\n\nterms of  imprisonment should be  ordered to run  concurrently or\r\n\nconsecutively,\"  28  U.S.C.      994(a)(1)(D),  the  court  below\r\n\npossessed  the power   indeed,  the responsibility    to impose a\r\n\nseries   of  consecutive   sentences  effectuating   the  clearly\r\n\nexpressed command of U.S.S.G.  5G1.2.\r\n\n          2.

This ululation is more  cry than\r\n\nwool.\r\n\n          In Solem  v.

Id. at 288, 303.  The Court\r                                                   \r\n\ndid  not in any way, shape,  or form, then or thereafter, suggest\r\n\nthat the Eighth Amendment requires a precise calibration of crime\r\n\nand punishment in noncapital cases.\r\n\n          Solem   looms   as  the   high   water   mark  of   the\r                         \r\n\nproportionality  approach.

The\r                                       \r\n\nConstitution does not require  legislatures to balance crimes and\r\n\npunishments  according  to any  single  standard,  or to  achieve\r\n\nperfect equipoise.   Indeed, the Solem  Court itself acknowledged\r                                                \r\n\n                                71\r\r\n\nthe  need for judges to \"grant substantial deference to the broad\r\n\nauthority  that legislatures  necessarily possess  in determining\r\n\nthe types and limits of punishment for crimes.\"   Solem, 463 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 290.\r\n\n          The  Court  also  has  sounded  two  cautionary  notes.\r\n\nFirst, \"[t]he inherent nature  of our federal system\" necessarily\r\n\nproduces  \"a wide range of constitutional sentences.\"  Id. at 291\r                                                                    \r\n\nn.17;  see also  Rummel,  445  U.S.  at  282.

With  this  as  a  reference  point,\r\n\nappellant's    sentence   can    hardly   be    deemed   \"grossly\r\n\ndisproportionate\" to  the underlying conduct    conduct which, by\r\n\nall accounts, significantly  facilitated narcotics trafficking on\r\n\na Brobdingnagian scale.30\r\n\n          To  say more  would be  supererogatory.

The  court\r\n\nacknowledged that  it possessed such authority,  but it concluded\r\n\n(appropriately,  we think)  that because the  guidelines required\r\n\nconsecutive sentences  in appellant's case, it  could only impose\r\n\nconcurrent sentences if  the case satisfied the conditions  for a\r\n\ndownward departure, that is, if it found mitigating circumstances\r\n\nnot  considered  by  the  Sentencing Commission.    See  U.S.S.G.\r                                                                 \r\n\n 5K2.0.   Discerning  no such  mitigation, the  court eschewed  a\r\n\ndownward departure.  In  other words, the court realized  that it\r\n\ncould  impose  concurrent  sentences  as  a  specie  of  downward\r\n\ndeparture,  cf.  Quinones,  26   F.3d  at  216  (authorizing  the\r                                   \r\n\nimposition  of  consecutive  sentences  as  a  specie  of  upward\r\n\ndeparture), but it  chose not to do so because,  in its judgment,\r\n\nthe facts did not warrant a downward departure.\r\n\n          This ends  our jaunt.   Inasmuch as the  district court\r\n\ncorrectly understood  that it possessed the power  to depart from\r\n\nthe  GSR  but  made  a discretionary  decision  to  refrain  from\r\n\nexercising   that  power,   we  lack   jurisdiction   to  address\r\n\nappellant's claim.  See Pierro, 32 F.3d at 619 (explaining that a\r                                        \r\n\ndiscretionary  refusal to depart  by a  judge who  recognizes his\r\n\npower, but who  says, in effect, that the case  before him is not\r\n\n\"sufficiently unusual to warrant departing,\" is not reviewable on\r\n\nappeal).\r\n\n                                76\r\r\n\n                   C.

Ex Post Facto Concerns.\r                                                       \r\n\n          Appellant seeks to incorporate  an argument advanced on\r\n\nappeal by  his  codefendants  to  the effect  that  the  district\r\n\ncourt's sentencing  determinations  abridged the  Ex  Post  Facto\r\n\nClause, U.S. Const. art. I,   9, cl. 3.  In appellant's view, the\r\n\ncourt's error lay in increasing his TOL based on  an amendment to\r\n\nthe  money  laundering guideline,  U.S.S.G.   2S1.1(b)(1),31 that\r\n\ndid  not become  effective until  November 1,  1991    during the\r\n\nlifespan of  the conspiracy,  but subsequent  to the  last proven\r\n\ninstance  of money laundering.  This criticism fails for at least\r\n\nthree reasons.\r\n\n          First,   appellant  did   not   broach  the   topic  at\r\n\nsentencing.  He has,  therefore, waived it.  See United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nDietz,  950  F.2d 50,  55 (1st  Cir.  1991) (explaining  that \"in\r               \r\n\nconnection  with sentencing as in other contexts, . . . arguments\r\n\nnot seasonably addressed to the trial court may not be raised for\r\n\nthe  first time  in an  appellate  venue\"); accord,  e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

App. C, Amend. No. 378  (1992),\r                                  \r\nwith the result that  the guideline, subsequent thereto, read  in\r\npertinent  part:   \"If the  defendant knew  or believed  that the\r                                                                 \r\nfunds were the  proceeds of  an unlawful  activity involving  the\r\nmanufacture, importation,  or distribution of narcotics  or other\r\ncontrolled  substances,   increased  [his  BOL]   by  3  levels.\"\r\n(Emphasis supplied to show added language).\r\n\n                                77\r\r\n\ncomptroller,  sales manager,  and  director of  operations.   The\r\n\nweight  of  the evidence  heavily  preponderates  in favor  of  a\r\n\nfinding that appellant knew and believed of the  money's origins.\r                                         \r\n\nIndeed,  appellant wholly fails to  demonstrate how and where the\r\n\ndistrict  court erred in  determining his level  of \"knowledge or\r\n\nbelief,\" or  why the guideline revision makes any real difference\r\n\nin his case.  This failure   typical of litigants  who attempt to\r                     \r\n\nincorporate  by reference  arguments which,  if made  in earnest,\r\n\ndeserve individualized attention   is fatal to appellant's cause.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Zannino,  895 F.2d at 17  (\"[I]ssues adverted to  in a\r                            \r\n\nperfunctory manner,  unaccompanied  by some  effort at  developed\r\n\nargumentation, are deemed waived.\").\r\n\n          Third, even  if appellant were somehow  to surmount the\r\n\ntwo hurdles we have just described, he could  prevail only upon a\r\n\nshowing of plain  error.  See United States v.  Olano, 113 S. Ct.\r                                                               \r\n\n1770, 1776-78 (1993); United  States v. Olivier-Diaz, 13  F.3d 1,\r                                                              \r\n\n5-6 (1st Cir. 1993).   Given the strict requirements  that attend\r\n\namelioration under the plain  error doctrine, and the substantial\r\n\ndiscretion  invested  in  appellate  courts with  regard  to  the\r\n\ndoctrine's use, see generally  Taylor,     F.3d at      [slip op.\r                                               \r\n\nat 6-7],  plain error  is plainly absent  here.  Put  bluntly, we\r\n\ndetect  nothing in appellant's belated  assault that causes us to\r\n\nquestion  \"the fundamental  fairness  or basic  integrity of  the\r\n\nproceeding  below in [any] major respect.\"   Id. at     [slip op.\r                                                          \r\n\nat 7].\r\n\n                   D.  Obstruction of Justice.\r                             D.

This sortie is moot.  The only practical\r\n\neffect  of the  adjustment is  to raise  the TOL  from 43  to 45.\r\n\nSince  life imprisonment  is mandatory  at or  above TOL  43, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nU.S.S.G.   5G1.2;  see also  U.S.S.G.   5A,  comment.

See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g., Sepulveda, 15 F.3d  at 1199; United States v.  Bradley, 917\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 601, 604 (1st  Cir. 1990).  We believe  that this philosophy\r\n\nis  fully applicable in a situation where, as here, correction of\r\n\nan allegedly erroneous finding  would not eliminate the certainty\r\n\nof  a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.  Courts should not\r\n\ntilt at windmills.\r\n\nVII.  CONCLUSION\r          VII.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go no  further.  Having scoured the  record and\r\n\ncarefully  considered  appellant's  entire  asseverational  array\r\n\n(including some arguments not  specifically discussed herein), we\r\n\ndetect no reversible error.

Finding that his arguments do not wash, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We sketch the bareboned facts in the light most amiable to the government, see United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 710-11 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1005, 122 L.Ed.2d 154 (1993), leaving much of the flesh and sinew for fuller articulation in connection with our discussion of particular issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant formerly controlled a network of precious metals businesses located in Rhode Island, New York, and California.  He became enmeshed in money laundering through his involvement with a fellow metalman, Barry Slomovits.  At a point in the mid-1980s, Slomovits was accepting millions of dollars in cash each week from Duvan Arboleda, who represented a group of Colombian drug lords (the Cali cartel).  Slomovits used some of this cash to purchase gold from appellant.  By special arrangement, the transactions were accomplished without documentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, Arboleda and appellant agreed that they would deal directly with each other.  From that juncture forward, appellant used his various businesses to cleanse money funnelled to him by the Cali cartel and its emissaries (including Arboleda, Fernando Duenas, and Raoul Escobar).  Typically, Arboleda would make large quantities of cash available to appellant;  appellant would send some of it to Slomovits in New York;  Slomovits would buy gold with the funds, resell the gold, and wire the proceeds to accounts that appellant controlled.  Slomovits received apocryphal invoices from appellant's companies purporting to show sales of gold for sums corresponding to the amounts of the wire transfers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahron Sharir, a manufacturer of gold chain, also washed money for appellant.  Appellant used Sharir's New York factory as a drop-off point for incoming shipments of currency, and Sharir laundered the cash by methods similar to those employed by Slomovits.  The shipments to Sharir's factory continued until 1988.  From then on, the two men forsook the New York factory, but continued to deal with each other.  Appellant delivered cash totalling over $35,000,000 to Sharir at other locations between 1988 and 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By 1990, appellant's operations had expanded and had become largely independent of Slomovits.  Appellant would bid for opportunities to launder money on behalf of the Cali cartel.  When the cartel accepted a bid, he or his couriers would receive sacks of currency at prearranged delivery points.  These shipments ordinarily ranged between $50,000 and $500,000 (although one delivery totalled $3,000,000).  The bills were usually in small denominations.  They would be counted, transported to one of appellant's offices in California or Rhode Island, then counted again, smurfed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and used to buy cashier's checks payable to one of appellant's companies.  These purchases were made at various banks by underlings (e.g., David Izzi, Anthony DeMarco, James Saccoccio, Kenneth Saccoccio) in accordance with instructions received from appellant or his wife, Donna Saccoccia.  After the checks had been deposited in a company account, the money would then be wired to a foreign bank designated by Arboleda or Duenas.  Along the way, appellant would deduct a commission that usually approximated ten percent of the laundered cash.  This completed \"la vuelta,\" the term used by the Cali cartel to describe a complete cycle of drug smuggling activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The spring of 1991 marked the beginning of the end of appellant's career in high finance.  During the early stages of his operation, the money received in New York was transported to Rhode Island by armored car and then deposited in an account standing in the name of a controlled corporation, Trend Precious Metals (Trend), at Citizens Bank.  Between January 1, 1990 and April 2, 1991, appellant and his wife wired over $136,000,000 out of the Trend account to an assortment of foreign banks.  Citizens became suspicious and closed the account.  In approximately the same time frame, an employee of an armored car service warned Richard Gizarelli, an unindicted coconspirator, that appellant was under investigation.  Gizarelli promptly informed appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding these omens, appellant persisted.  He did, however, alter his modus operandi.   Instead of using private couriers to transport cash from New York to Rhode Island, he sent any of four men--Izzi, Carlo DeMarco, Anthony DeMarco, or Vincent Hurley, often (but not always) operating in pairs--to haul the money to Rhode Island.  And, although appellant's cohorts continued to purchase bank checks from various Rhode Island financial institutions, appellant began to send the checks to his offices in California by air courier, often in canisters labeled as containing gold (to which appellant's henchmen added slag or scrap metal to increase weight).  Accomplices used the money to purchase gold, which was then sold on the open market.  The proceeds were eventually wired back to one of appellant's remaining Rhode Island accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August of 1991, appellant convened a meeting at his mother's home.  He showed the conferees (who included Donna Saccoccia, Izzi, and the two DeMarcos) a videotape that had been discovered accidentally in a nearby building.  The tape reflected an ongoing surveillance of the back entrance to appellant's Cranston coin shop.  He advised his colleagues to start using the store's front entrance.  Soon thereafter, appellant departed for Switzerland.  In short order, the authorities indicted and extradited him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After unsuccessfully seeking to postpone prosecution on health-related grounds,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> appellant went to trial on November 4, 1992, in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, along with several other indicted coconspirators (including his wife).  Appellant's attorney became ill during trial, and the court declared a mistrial as to appellant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The new trial began on February 17, 1993, and resulted in his conviction.  These appeals followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Saccoccia's appeals were consolidated for oral argument with the appeals arising out of the first trial.  See supra note 3.  Notwithstanding the obvious differences in the trial records and in the posture of the prosecutions--for example, appellant was the leader of the money laundering organization; unlike most of the others, he was not tried for currency transaction reporting (CTR) offenses;  and he was convicted in a trial separate from that of his codefendants--appellant seeks to incorporate by reference eight arguments advanced by other defendants.  Because appellant's position is not substantially similar to that of the codefendants, and because he has failed to develop the idiosyncracies of his own situation, we deem five of those arguments to have been abandoned.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 737 (1st Cir.1991) (\"Adoption by reference, however, cannot occur in a vacuum;  to be meaningful, the arguments adopted must be readily transferrable from the proponent's case to the adopter's case.\"), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 955, 112 S.Ct. 2301, 119 L.Ed.2d 224 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we are left with no shortage of food for thought.  Appellant has served up a bouillabaisse of other offerings.  We address his meatier propositions below, including the three \"incorporated\" contentions that arguably have been preserved.  And although we do not deem detailed discussion desirable, the record should reflect that we have masticated appellant's remaining points and found them indigestible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. EXTRADITION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold matter, appellant maintains that his trial and ensuing conviction violated the extradition treaty between the United States and Switzerland, and, in the bargain, transgressed the principles of dual criminality and specialty.  We reject these importunings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>A. Gaining Perspective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further facts are needed to place appellant's extradition-related claims into a workable perspective.  On November 18, 1991, a federal grand jury returned the indictment that inaugurated this prosecution.  Count 1 charged appellant, his wife, and eleven associates with RICO conspiracy.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(d) (1988).  A RICO conspiracy, of course, requires the government to prove, inter alia, an illicit agreement to conduct a pattern of racketeering activity.  See United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 503 (1st Cir.1990);  see also 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c) (1988).  Proof of a pattern demands that the prosecution show \"at least two acts of racketeering activity.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(5) (1988).  These acts, which must themselves comprise violations of specified criminal statutes, see id. Sec. 1961(1)(B), are commonly referred to as \"predicates\" or \"predicate acts.\"   See, e.g., Ruiz, 905 F.2d at 503.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant indictment, the alleged racketeering activity comprised, among other specified predicate acts, incidents of money laundering, see 18 U.S.C. Secs. 1956, 1957, CTR violations, see 31 U.S.C. Sec. 5324(a)(1)-(3), and using travel and facilities in interstate commerce to promote these money laundering ventures, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1952(a)(3).  The grand jury also averred that the RICO conspiracy had been accomplished by means that included failing to file the necessary CTRs for cash transactions over $10,000.  Counts 2-53 of the indictment charged appellant and others with failing to file CTRs in specific instances, see 31 U.S.C. Sec. 5324(a)(1);  counts 54-68 charged appellant with illegally structuring monetary transactions in order to avoid the CTR reporting requirements, see id. Sec. 5324(a)(3);  counts 69-129 charged appellant and his wife with the use of property derived from unlawful activities while engaging in monetary transactions affecting interstate commerce, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956;  counts 130-142 charged appellant and his wife with money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956(a)(2);  and counts 143-150 charged appellant and others with Travel Act violations under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1952(a)(3).  The indictment also contained forfeiture allegations under the applicable RICO and money laundering statutes.  See 18 U.S.C. Secs. 982, 1963.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six days after the grand jury returned the indictment, Swiss authorities arrested the Saccoccias in Geneva.  They contested extradition on counts 1 through 68, and counts 143 through 150.  On June 11, 1992, the Swiss Federal Tribunal (SFT) granted extradition on all charges except those contained in counts 2 through 68.  The SFT reasoned that these 67 counts constituted nonextraditable offenses because Swiss law did not prohibit the underlying conduct.  The SFT's discussion did not specifically mention the forfeiture allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Swiss surrendered appellant to the United States.  He was transported to Rhode Island and arraigned on July 15.  One week later, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  On July 30, the Justice Department, in the person of Michael O'Hare, wrote to Tania Cavassini, a Swiss official, enclosing a copy of the superseding indictment and inquiring whether it required a waiver of the rule of specialty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 1, 1992, apparently in response to an inquiry from Cavassini, O'Hare transmitted a written assurance that, although the court papers still formally listed appellant as a defendant in respect to the CTR counts (for which extradition had been denied), the prosecution did not intend to press those counts.  O'Hare explained that the prosecutor would offer no evidence of appellant's guilt on those charges, with the result that \"American law [will require] the judge to direct the jury to find the defendant not guilty.\"   The following day, Cavassini advised that, under a \"final decision\" dated November 20, 1992, the SFT had \"granted extradition of [appellant] for the facts enclosed in the Count Nr. 1 of the Superseding Indictment.\"   Cavassini also indicated that appellant's local counsel in Geneva agreed with the SFT's decision and had scotched any possibility of a further appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 2, 1993, before the start of the trial with which we are concerned, the government moved to dismiss those counts of the superseding indictment (counts 2-37) that charged appellant with CTR offenses.  The district court complied.  The matter resurfaced in a slightly different shape ten days later when appellant's Swiss lawyer, Paul Gully-Hart, wrote to Cavassini expressing concern that appellant's impending prosecution on charges in which CTR violations were embedded as predicates for other offenses would insult the rule of specialty.  On March 2, Gully-Hart wrote again, this time enclosing a copy of the prosecution's opening statement to the petit jury.  Cavassini forwarded both of these letters to O'Hare.  On March 8, Cavassini spoke with O'Hare and voiced her concern that appellant might be convicted under count 1 solely on the basis of CTR offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, Assistant United States Attorney James Leavey, a member of the prosecution team, advised Judge Torres that he had spoken with O'Hare.  Without conceding the legal validity of Gully-Hart's point, Leavey asked the court to instruct the jury that CTR violations could not serve as predicates for purposes of either the RICO or Travel Act counts.  When the court acquiesced, the government submitted a redacted indictment that deleted all references to CTR offenses from the RICO and Travel Act counts.  Appellant nonetheless moved for a mistrial, invoking the rules of dual criminality and specialty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the motion, explaining that it had agreed to the government's proposal purely as an accommodation.  In the judge's view, the precautions were not legally required because the SFT had been pellucid in authorizing prosecution on the RICO count even though the claimed CTR violations were prominently displayed therein as potential predicates.  The judge noted, moreover, that evidence of appellant's CTR violations was in all events admissible in connection with the substantive money laundering counts (as to which extradition had been approved).  Appellant resurrected the issue in his motion for a new trial following the adverse jury verdict.  The court stood firm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>B. Dual Criminality and Specialty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the principles of dual criminality and specialty are closely allied, they are not coterminous.  We elaborate below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Dual Criminality.   The principle of dual criminality dictates that, as a general rule, an extraditable offense must be a serious crime (rather than a mere peccadillo) punishable under the criminal laws of both the surrendering and the requesting state.  See Brauch v. Raiche, 618 F.2d 843, 847 (1st Cir.1980).  The current extradition treaty between the United States and Switzerland embodies this concept.  See Treaty of Extradition, May 14, 1900, U.S.-Switz., Art.  II, 31 Stat. 1928, 1929-30 (Treaty).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principle of dual criminality does not demand that the laws of the surrendering and requesting states be carbon copies of one another.  Thus, dual criminality will not be defeated by differences in the instrumentalities or in the stated purposes of the two nations' laws.  See Peters v. Egnor, 888 F.2d 713, 719 (10th Cir.1989).  By the same token, the counterpart crimes need not have identical elements.  See Matter of Extradition of Russell, 789 F.2d 801, 803 (9th Cir.1986).  Instead, dual criminality is deemed to be satisfied when the two countries' laws are substantially analogous.  See Peters, 888 F.2d at 719;  Brauch, 618 F.2d at 851.   Moreover, in mulling dual criminality concerns, courts are duty bound to defer to a surrendering sovereign's reasonable determination that the offense in question is extraditable.  See Casey v. Department of State, 980 F.2d 1472, 1477 (D.C.Cir.1992) (observing that an American court must give great deference to a foreign court's determination in extradition proceedings);  United States v. Van Cauwenberghe, 827 F.2d 424, 429 (9th Cir.1987) (similar), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1042, 108 S.Ct. 773, 98 L.Ed.2d 859 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mechanically, then, the inquiry into dual criminality requires courts to compare the law of the surrendering state that purports to criminalize the charged conduct with the law of the requesting state that purports to accomplish the same result.  If the same conduct is subject to criminal sanctions in both jurisdictions, no more is exigible.  See United States v. Levy, 905 F.2d 326, 328 (10th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1049, 111 S.Ct. 759, 112 L.Ed.2d 778 (1991);  see also Collins v. Loisel, 259 U.S. 309, 312, 42 S.Ct. 469, 471, 66 L.Ed. 956 (1922) (\"It is enough [to satisfy the requirement of dual criminality] if the particular act charged is criminal in both jurisdictions.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Specialty.  The principle of specialty--a corollary to the principle of dual criminality, see United States v. Herbage, 850 F.2d 1463, 1465 (11th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1027, 109 S.Ct. 1158, 103 L.Ed.2d 217 (1989)--generally requires that an extradited defendant be tried for the crimes on which extradition has been granted, and none other.  See Van Cauwenberghe, 827 F.2d at 428;  Quinn v. Robinson, 783 F.2d 776, 783 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 882, 107 S.Ct. 271, 93 L.Ed.2d 247 (1986).  The extradition treaty in force between the United States and Switzerland embodies this concept, providing that an individual may not be \"prosecuted or punished for any offense committed before the demand for extradition, other than that for which the extradition is granted....\"  Treaty, Art.  IX.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enforcement of the principle of specialty is founded primarily on international comity.  See United States v. Thirion, 813 F.2d 146, 151 (8th Cir.1987).  The requesting state must \"live up to whatever promises it made in order to obtain extradition\" because preservation of the institution of extradition requires the continuing cooperation of the surrendering state.  United States v. Najohn, 785 F.2d 1420, 1422 (9th Cir.)  (per curiam), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1009, 107 S.Ct. 652, 93 L.Ed.2d 707 (1986).  Since the doctrine is grounded in international comity rather than in some right of the defendant, the principle of specialty may be waived by the asylum state.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specialty, like dual criminality, is not a hidebound dogma, but must be applied in a practical, commonsense fashion.  Thus, obeisance to the principle of specialty does not require that a defendant be prosecuted only under the precise indictment that prompted his extradition, see United States v. Andonian, 29 F.3d 1432, 1435-36 (9th Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 938, 130 L.Ed.2d 883 (1995), or that the prosecution always be limited to specific offenses enumerated in the surrendering state's extradition order, see Levy, 905 F.2d at 329 (concluding that a Hong Kong court intended to extradite defendant to face a continuing criminal enterprise charge despite the court's failure specifically to mention that charge in the deportation order).  In the same vein, the principle of specialty does not impose any limitation on the particulars of the charges lodged by the requesting nation, nor does it demand departure from the forum's existing rules of practice (such as rules of pleading, evidence, or procedure).  See United States v. Alvarez-Moreno, 874 F.2d 1402, 1414 (11th Cir.1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1032, 110 S.Ct. 1484, 108 L.Ed.2d 620 (1990);  Thirion, 813 F.2d at 153;  Demjanjuk v. Petrovsky, 776 F.2d 571, 583 (6th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1016, 106 S.Ct. 1198, 89 L.Ed.2d 312 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last analysis, then, the inquiry into specialty boils down to whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the court in the requesting state reasonably believes that prosecuting the defendant on particular charges contradicts the surrendering state's manifested intentions, or, phrased another way, whether the surrendering state would deem the conduct for which the requesting state actually prosecutes the defendant as interconnected with (as opposed to independent from) the acts for which he was extradited.  See Andonian, 29 F.3d at 1435;  United States v. Cuevas, 847 F.2d 1417, 1427-28 (9th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1012, 109 S.Ct. 1122, 103 L.Ed.2d 185 (1989);  United States v. Paroutian, 299 F.2d 486, 490-91 (2d Cir.1962).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>C. Applying the Principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's interpretation of the principles of dual criminality and specialty traditionally involves a question of law and is, therefore, subject to plenary review in the court of appeals.  See Andonian, 29 F.3d at 1434;  United States v. Khan, 993 F.2d 1368, 1372 (9th Cir.1993);  United States v. Abello-Silva, 948 F.2d 1168, 1173 (10th Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 107, 121 L.Ed.2d 65 (1992).  Marching beneath this banner, appellant urges that his conviction must be set aside for three related reasons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  None has merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Predicate Acts.   Appellant's flagship contention rests on the postulate that an offense which is itself nonextraditable cannot serve as a predicate act in connection with other, extraditable offenses;  and that, therefore, the government's use of nonextraditable CTR offenses as predicate acts for purposes of the RICO and Travel Act counts crossed the line into forbidden territory.  Even if we assume, however, that in some situations reliance on nonextraditable offenses as predicates for other, extraditable offenses might run afoul of dual criminality or specialty principles, the circumstances of this case present no such problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, we do not believe that there can be a violation of the principle of specialty where the requesting nation prosecutes the returned fugitive for the exact crimes on which the surrendering nation granted extradition.  So it is here:  the SFT twice approved appellant's extradition on counts that prominently featured CTR offenses as predicates.  This approval--to which we must pay the substantial deference that is due to a surrendering court's resolution of questions pertaining to extraditability, see, e.g., Casey, 980 F.2d at 1477--strongly suggests that the RICO and Travel Act counts, despite their mention of predicates which, standing alone, would not support extradition, are compatible with the criminal laws of both jurisdictions.  Though a Swiss official may informally have fretted about the prospect of a RICO or Travel Act conviction based on nonextraditable predicates, we are reluctant to conclude on this gossamer showing that the SFT did not know and appreciate the clearly expressed contents of the indictment when it sanctioned extradition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To clinch matters, the prosecution avoided any potential intrusion on the principles of either dual criminality or specialty by taking a series of prophylactic actions at trial.  The fourth redacted indictment removed all references to CTR offenses from the compendium of charges pressed against the appellant.  The judge then reinforced this fumigation of the indictment by advising the jurors that they should not concern themselves with whether appellant had committed any CTR offenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  These precautions purged any taint, and knocked the legs out from under the line of reasoning that appellant seeks to pursue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Keeping Faith.   Next, appellant asserts that the government infringed on the principle of specialty by breaking its promise to the Swiss government and introducing evidence of CTR violations at appellant's trial.  Abstractly, we agree with the core element of appellant's premise:  the principle of specialty requires the requesting state to abide by the promises it makes to the surrendering state in the process of procuring extradition.  See Najohn, 785 F.2d at 1422.   But, concretely, we are unable to discern any breach of faith in this instance.  Thus, we resist the conclusion that appellant would foist upon us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To buttress the claim that the United States did not keep its word, appellant avers that O'Hare's facsimile transmission, sent on December 1, 1992, was the functional equivalent of an assurance that the prosecutor would not present any evidence to the jury regarding Saccoccia's noncompliance with CTR requirements.  Fairly read, the document--despite its iteration that the prosecutor \"would present no evidence regarding [Saccoccia's] guilt ... on the charges for which extradition was not granted\"--does not support appellant's construction.  O'Hare sent the transmittal in response to Cavassini's expression of concern that appellant might be convicted of charges for which extradition had been denied.  His reply, taken in context, see supra p. 765, amounted to no more than an assurance against that possibility.   To read a promise not to introduce any evidence relevant to CTR violations into O'Hare's statement would necessitate wresting it from its contextual moorings and unreasonably stretching its literal meaning.  We decline appellant's invitation to indulge in such phantasmagoric wordplay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The Claimed \"Prosecution.\"   Appellant's third contention is that the government violated the principle of specialty because it prosecuted him for CTR offenses.  Since the nonextraditable CTR counts, as they pertained to appellant, were dismissed before the second trial began, his claim is founded on no more than the fact that his name appeared on the indictment during the first trial.  While this may literally be \"prosecution,\" it is prosecution in name only--and we will not carry hollow formalism to a point at which it engulfs common sense.  Consequently, we hold that the mere existence of an unredacted indictment, under the circumstances of this case, is no reason to invalidate Saccoccia's conviction.  Cf. Tacket v. Delco Remy Div. of Gen. Motors Corp., 937 F.2d 1201, 1202 (7th Cir.1991) (Bauer, C.J.)  (quoting doggerel to the effect that \"[s]ticks and stones may break your bones, but names can never hurt you\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves appellant's argument that he was illegally \"prosecuted\" because CTR offenses were included as predicate acts for purposes of the RICO and Travel Act counts until the fourth redacted indictment surfaced.  As we have already observed, however, it would have been perfectly proper for the government to seek convictions on those counts based on CTR predicates.  Hence, appellant's argument is without merit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we find appellant's conviction free from taint under the applicable extradition laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE COVETED CONTINUANCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that the district court arbitrarily refused him a lengthy continuance prior to the start of the second trial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> leaving him with insufficient preparation time.  Our analysis of the record indicates that the court acted within its discretion in scotching appellant's request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>A. Setting the Stage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At arraignment, two attorneys, Jack Hill and Brian Adae, entered appearances as appellant's counsel.  Soon thereafter, Austrian authorities arrested Hill for money laundering.  Hill languished in prison from August through November of 1992.  During that interval, he could not communicate with, or effectively assist, Saccoccia.  Adae, who had originally been enlisted as local counsel, stepped into the breach and acted as lead counsel.  Shortly after the first trial began, Adae became ill.  The court granted appellant's motion for a mistrial and ordered a severance.  The case proceeded to verdict vis-a-vis the other defendants.  See supra note 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Naturally, the severance required a separate trial for appellant.  The district court proposed to start in early February of 1993.  Within a matter of days after the court announced the schedule, Hill, recently released from an Austrian prison, and Kenneth O'Donnell, a prominent Rhode Island defense lawyer, entered appearances as appellant's counsel.  On December 10, 1992, appellant signed an extensive waiver of the potential conflict of interest posed by Hill's representation of him at a time when Hill himself faced charges of money laundering arising out of activities undertaken in conjunction with appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day, the court held a hearing anent the waiver.  Among other things, appellant requested that his trial be rescheduled to April of 1993 so that his defense team could have more time to prepare.  He claimed this extra time was necessary to review financial documents, study surveillance tapes, glean exculpatory evidence, and analyze inconsistencies in the statements of government witnesses.  The court granted only a two-week extension, from February 3 to February 17, noting that the original indictment had been returned in 1991 and that counsel already had enjoyed a considerable period for preparation.  Subsequent requests for continuances were also denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>B. Applicable Legal Principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial management is peculiarly within the ken of the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  That court has great latitude in managing its docket, including broad discretion to grant or withhold continuances.  Only \"an unreasoning and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay\" constitutes an abuse of that discretion.  Morris v. Slappy, 461 U.S. 1, 11-12, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 1616-17, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted);  see also United States v. Devin, 918 F.2d 280, 291 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that an appellate court \"must show great deference\" to district court decisions of this nature, and should overturn such decisions \"only for a manifest abuse of discretion\").  For present purposes, this means that the decision below must endure unless the party who moved for the continuance can demonstrate that, in withholding relief, the trial court indulged a serious error of law or suffered a meaningful lapse of judgment, resulting in substantial prejudice to the movant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  See, e.g., United States v. Saget, 991 F.2d 702, 708 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 396, 126 L.Ed.2d 344 (1993);  United States v. Dennis, 843 F.2d 652, 653 n. 1 (2d Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purpose of determining whether a denial of a continuance constitutes an abuse of discretion, each case is sui generis.  See United States v. Torres, 793 F.2d 436, 440 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 889, 107 S.Ct. 287, 93 L.Ed.2d 262 (1986).  A reviewing court must look first at the reasons contemporaneously presented in support of the request for the continuance.  See United States v. Lussier, 929 F.2d 25, 28 (1st Cir.1991).  Other relevant factors may include such things as the amount of time needed for effective preparation, the amount of time actually available for preparation, the amount of time previously available for preparation and how assiduously the movant used that time, the extent to which the movant has contributed to his perceived predicament, the complexity of the case, the availability of assistance from other sources, the probable utility of a continuance, the extent of inconvenience to others (such as the court, the witnesses, and the opposing party) should a continuance ensue, and the likelihood of injustice or unfair prejudice attributable to the denial of a continuance.  See United States v. Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d 480, 488 (1st Cir.1994);  Lussier, 929 F.2d at 28;  United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 13-14 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>C. Analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, balancing the relevant considerations leaves us confident that the circumstances justified the refusal to grant a continuance.  And, moreover, the record belies appellant's contention that the court's obduracy unfairly prejudiced his rights by leaving him insufficient time to prepare for trial.  Appellant's most loudly bruited point is that the government produced 1600 hours of wiretap audio tapes, and that he had only 67 days, which he translates as equalling 1608 hours, to listen to them.  Although this lament has some superficial plausibility, we agree with the district court that, notwithstanding the number of tapes, it was reasonable to expect defense counsel to be ready for trial in February.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grand jury indicted appellant in November of 1991.  Thus, appellant's counsel, collectively, had far more than 67 days in which to work on the case.  Moreover, the lawyers had the not inconsiderable benefit of a dress rehearsal, including unlimited access to the full record of the first trial (in which virtually the entire case against appellant was aired).  O'Donnell, one of appellant's new attorneys, was especially familiar with the situation because he had represented a codefendant who had been acquitted in a separate trial.  Furthermore, Hill and O'Donnell could--and no doubt did--confer with counsel for the codefendants and with Attorney Adae.  In short, the means for efficacious preparation were tidily at hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's other assertions of supposed prejudice also lack force.  For example, his suggestion that a continuance might have enabled him to receive a complete transcript of Agent Shedd's conversation with Duenas overlooks the fact that the government provided him with the entire transcript.  See infra Part IV(E).  His claim that more time was needed to obtain a copy of a DEA report that he asserts would have bolstered the testimony of an expert witness overlooks the fact that the expert knew of the report and described its conclusions.  See infra note 18.  His claim that a continuance would have enabled him to obtain enhanced versions of two of the surveillance tapes before trial, see infra Part IV(F), is completely unpersuasive given his assertion that the enhanced tapes, when received, were \"unclear\" and \"unintelligible.\"   Appellant's Brief at 36.  And, finally, appellant's exhortation that a continuance would have allowed him to investigate whether the laundered cash represented gambling proceeds, as opposed to drug money, is unaccompanied by any colorable basis for assuming that his supposition was anything more than the most remote of possibilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a nutshell, appellant has not made a sufficient showing of undue prejudice to warrant us in second-guessing either the district court's resolve to start the trial in mid-February of 1993 or its decision to grant appellant a far more modest delay than he requested.  Since the record reflects no pressing need for an extended continuance, and likewise fails to demonstrate significant harm flowing from the lack of one, the denial of the motion for a continuance cannot be said to have substantially impaired appellant's defense.  See, e.g., Dennis, 843 F.2d at 653 n. 1.   Thus, no cognizable error inheres.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p>D. Conflict of Interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relatedly, appellant claims that the denial of a continuance saddled him with conflict-ridden counsel.  This construct does not withstand scrutiny.  To show an actual conflict of interest, a criminal defendant \"must demonstrate that some plausible alternative defense strategy might have been pursued\" and \"that this alternative strategy was not pursued because of the attorney's other loyalties or interests.\"  United States v. Garcia-Rosa, 876 F.2d 209, 231 (1st Cir.1989), cert. granted and judgment vacated on other grounds, 498 U.S. 954, 111 S.Ct. 377, 112 L.Ed.2d 391 (1990).  Appellant cannot meet this standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant sees the conflict of interest as centered in Hill's need to protect himself at his client's expense.  Appellant supports this accusation by repeated reference to Hill's indictment in Austria on charges that he conspired with appellant to launder the fruits of unlawful activity--but appellant does not suggest any way in which this alleged conflict of interest adversely affected Hill's representation of him at trial.  What is more, appellant's claim that he was faced with an intolerable dilemma--he could accept Hill as his counsel or proceed to trial with an attorney who was untutored in the case--is flatly contradicted by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant insisted, time and again, despite the district court's painstaking explanation of his right to conflict-free counsel, that Hill was the advocate of his choosing.  Appellant told the court unequivocally that he understood the potential conflict, but desired Hill's services.  And he adhered to his position notwithstanding the court's entreaty to reconsider and its advice that he would be \"better off\" with an attorney free of any ties to the situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last--but surely not least--appellant executed a written waiver stating that, after \"[h]aving been fully advised of the possible adverse consequences arising from the actual or potential conflicts with which Hill is or may be encumbered,\" he \"knowingly, voluntarily, intelligently, and irrevocably [wishes] to waive any and all such actual or potential conflicts of interest for the purpose of retaining Hill as his counsel.\"   When a defendant knowingly selects a course of action, fully cognizant of its perils, he cannot later repudiate it simply because his case curdles.  In the circumstances at bar, it is neither unfair nor unjust to hold appellant to his words.  Thus, the district court's determination that appellant had voluntarily and knowingly waived his right to conflict-free representation is unimpugnable.  See Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475, 483 n. 5, 98 S.Ct. 1173, 1178 n. 5, 55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978) (stating that \"a defendant may waive his right to the assistance of an attorney unhindered by a conflict of interests\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant has another arrow in this quiver.  He reasons that the court should have overlooked his waiver of conflict-free counsel because Hill's continued representation constituted an unwaivable constitutional transgression.  To be sure, a few courts have found a per se Sixth Amendment violation \"where trial counsel was implicated in the crime for which his client was on trial.\"  Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d at 487 n. 4 (citing cases).  But these cases tend to involve circumstances in which an attorney has reason to fear that a vigorous defense of the client might unearth proof of the attorney's criminality.  See, e.g., United States v. Cancilla, 725 F.2d 867, 870 (2d Cir.1984).  Although Hill informed the court, in the vaguest of generalities, that he feared being charged or called as a witness in appellant's case, he provided no substantiation of these assertions, nor was he able to explain how the hypothetical conflict would, at that time, affect his representation of the appellant.  Therefore, the district court seems entirely justified in concluding that Hill's representation of appellant would not be hampered by a realistic foreboding that vigorous advocacy would uncover evidence of his own crimes.  Cf. William Shakespeare, Macbeth, Act I, sc. iii, ll. 133-34 (1605) (noting that \"present fears are less than horrible imaginings\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sockdolager is that, wholly apart from Hill's status, appellant was also represented at trial by another lawyer, O'Donnell, who had no conflict of interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  In an effort to scale this rampart, appellant suggests that O'Donnell, too, had an actual conflict of interest arising out of his previous representation of a codefendant, Raymond Marotto.  By December of 1992, however, Marotto, a bank employee charged with failing to file CTRs, had been acquitted in a separate trial.  Appellant's convoluted explanation of how O'Donnell's concluded representation of Marotto created a conflict of interest is difficult to follow.  He seems to be saying, without any citation to the record, that Marotto (who was not called to testify at appellant's trial) could have been a material witness.  We reject this unfounded speculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As O'Donnell himself pointed out, Marotto's case turned on whether he did--or did not--have a responsibility to file CTRs.  There is nothing in the record that suggests that Marotto had any knowledge that might have been useful in appellant's defense.  We have routinely dismissed analogous conflict of interest claims, see, e.g., Garcia-Rosa, 876 F.2d at 231 (so holding when defendant \"provide[d] no substantiation\" for his assertion that his counsel had a conflict of interest that manifested itself when he did not call as a witness a person whom he previously had represented), and we dismiss appellant's claim on the same basis.  It is simply too flimsy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p>E. The Mid-Trial Motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the government's case, appellant submitted a proffer in support of a renewed motion for a continuance.  The proffer suggested a global conspiracy \"between the Israeli intelligence services and the CIA,\" and asserted that he had witnesses who \"would testify about such matters as the Israeli defense industry\" and \"[t]he method by which the building of Israeli religious schools is financed by Hasidic Jews in the United States who engage in money laundering.\"   Appellant claimed that his counsel needed time to investigate the matters described in the proffer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found the proffer to be \"too vague and unsubstantiated to constitute a basis for granting a continuance\" because its \"conclusory allegations\" offered no explanation as to its relevancy to the case.  Moreover, the court found no evidence that diligent efforts had been made to assure availability of the testimony and documents in a proper time frame.  Hence, the court determined that the proffer afforded an inadequate basis for the requested continuance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no abuse of discretion.  While the proffer weaves a tale of intrigue worthy of an Oliver Stone screenplay, we are unable to distill sufficient relevance or likelihood of success from its sinister allegations to suggest that a continuance, if granted, would have proven useful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. MONEY AND DRUGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to obtain a conviction on the money laundering counts, as charged in the superseding indictment, the government had the burden of proving that the laundered funds were derived from the narcotics trade.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956(a)(2).  Appellant challenges both the admissibility and the sufficiency of the evidence introduced for this purpose.  The challenge is unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>A. Standard of Review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court has considerable discretion when determining whether evidence is admissible.  See United States v. Paulino, 13 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir.1994);  Zannino, 895 F.2d at 16-17;  United States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1126 (1st Cir.1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1005, 110 S.Ct. 1300, 108 L.Ed.2d 477 (1990).  Where, as here, the court finds that evidence is relevant, Fed.R.Evid. 401, but the defendant nonetheless objects to it on the ground that its value is overborne by the potential mischief it may cause, Fed.R.Evid. 403, the trial court must \"strike a balance between probative worth and likely prejudice.\"  Zannino, 895 F.2d at 16-17.   The district court is the primary arbiter of how these scales should be calibrated.  On appeal, we will reverse its determination only if admitting the evidence constituted a palpable abuse of discretion.  See United States v. De La Cruz, 902 F.2d 121, 124 (1st Cir.1990);  United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 155-56 (1st Cir.1989).  This is a difficult row to hoe:  \"Only rarely--and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances--will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\"  Freeman v. Package Mach. Corp., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When no contemporaneous objection appears of record, the complaining party's burden increases.  In that situation, appellate review is for \"plain error.\"  United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1187 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2714, 129 L.Ed.2d 840 (1994);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).  When the plain error standard prevails, we reverse only if a miscue \"so poisoned the well that the trial's outcome was likely affected.\"  Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1188 (quoting United States v. Mejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d 268, 274 (1st Cir.1987)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A different standard of review takes center stage when a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction.  In that connection, the inquiry turns on whether, \"after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government, and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.\"  United States v. O'Brien, 14 F.3d 703, 706 (1st Cir.1994).  In performing the requisite analysis, we do not assess the credibility of witnesses, see id., nor do we force the government to disprove every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, see United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>B. National Origin Evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that the prosecution made unfair use of impermissibly suggestive innuendo and stereotypes about Colombians, thereby inviting reversal.  Appellant's argument focuses on evidence adduced, or remarks made, at four different points during his trial.  First, appellant accuses the government of eliciting testimony concerning the birthplaces of Escobar and Garcia (both of whom were born in Colombia), while not inquiring about any other individual's place of birth.  Second, the court permitted Sharir to testify that appellant told him to be careful because he was dealing with Colombians, who would go after his family if they were crossed.  Third, when Donald Semesky, an IRS agent, offered expert testimony as to the modus operandi of Colombian drug cartels, he mentioned, among other things, that two Colombian cartels control the illegal importation of cocaine into the United States, and that their narcotics trafficking generates much cash, necessitating money laundering.  Fourth, the government's summation hammered these same points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Due to the singular importance of keeping our criminal justice system on an even keel, respecting the rights of all persons, courts must not tolerate prosecutors' efforts gratuitously to inject issues like race and ethnicity into criminal trials.  See McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 309 &amp; n. 30, 107 S.Ct. 1756, 1777 &amp; n. 30, 95 L.Ed.2d 262 (1987);  United States v. Doe, 903 F.2d 16, 21 (D.C.Cir.1990).  Emphasizing a person's national origin not only may raise concerns of relevancy, undue prejudice, and prosecutorial misconduct, but also may pose issues of constitutional dimension.  See, e.g., United States v. Vue, 13 F.3d 1206, 1213 (8th Cir.1994);  United States v. Rodriguez Cortes, 949 F.2d 532, 541 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean, however, that all evidence touching upon race or national origin automatically must be excluded.  A trial involves a search for the truth, and, as such, it cannot be entirely antiseptic.  The trick is to separate impermissible uses of highly charged evidence from those uses that are proper and permissible.  See United States v. Alzanki, 54 F.3d 994, 1007-08 (1st Cir.1995);  Doe, 903 F.2d at 25.   Thus, while it has proven acceptable on occasion for a prosecutor to introduce evidence of oppressive Kuwaiti customs to buttress the reasonableness of the victim's professed belief, see Alzanki, 54 F.3d at 1008, or to make an \"unembellished reference to evidence of race simply as a factor bolstering an eyewitness identification of the culprit,\" Doe, 903 F.2d at 25 (dictum), or to remark that an Iranian defendant likely assumed that his \"American wife\" would not be searched at customs, United States v. Tajeddini, 996 F.2d 1278, 1285 (1st Cir.1993),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> or to describe drugs as coming from Colombia to give the jury a complete view of the conspiracy's endeavors to import cocaine, see United States v. Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d 212, 220 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1322, 131 L.Ed.2d 202 (1995), aggressive prosecutors sometimes go too far.  When that occurs, courts must act.  We have, for instance, reversed convictions when, as in Rodriguez Cortes, the government's strategem blatantly invited the jury to find the defendant guilty by reason of his national origin.  See Rodriguez Cortes, 949 F.2d at 541 (finding abuse of discretion in admission of defendant's Colombian identification card);  see also Vue, 13 F.3d at 1212-13 (reversing conviction because district court admitted testimony tying defendant's ethnic group, the Hmong, to 95% of the local opium trade);  Doe, 903 F.2d at 23-27 (reversing conviction due to admission of testimony on modus operandi of Jamaican drug gangs and prosecutor's inflammatory comments thereon).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining the propriety of evidence implicating ethnicity or national origin, context is critical.  In the case at bar, all the evidence about Colombia, viewed in context, was properly admitted and used.  By like token, the prosecutor's comments were not beyond the pale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's first contention is factually incorrect.  The prosecutor asked several witnesses other than Escobar and Garcia (e.g., Sharir and Slomovits) where they were born.  Seen in this light, the casual questioning about place of birth, not objected to at trial, cannot conceivably plunge to the plane of plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Sharir's testimony that Saccoccia told him to be wary because he was dealing with Colombians is highly probative on the issue of appellant's knowledge that the laundered funds were derived from illegal activities.  Moreover, common sense suggests that drug traffickers are more likely than, say, Avon ladies, to harm the families of business associates if a deal sours.  It is, therefore, a gross exaggeration to declare that the evidence had no purpose other than to suggest that Colombians are prone to violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Agent Semesky's testimony was relevant and appropriate in several respects.  First, it went a long way toward explaining the nature of money laundering and the basis for appellant's activities.  This is a perfectly legitimate use of evidence.  See Doe, 903 F.2d at 19 &amp; n. 21 (citing cases).  Even the testimony about the cartels' control over the American drug trade was relevant on the issue of whether the cash that appellant scrubbed clean was in fact derived from illegal activities.  The evidence could support a jury's plausible, though circumstantial, inference of an illicit source of funds based on appellant's repeated wire transfers of millions of dollars in laundered money to a country that functions as the nerve center of the world's traffic in cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only remotely problematic references to Colombia are those contained in the summation.  For example, a prosecutor stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p>[Agent Semesky] told you as an expert, something you probably already knew, that cocaine comes from Colombia.  That it's run by cartels in Colombia.  That they ship the money up here and it gets out into the streets.  That's the reason for all these ten and twenty dollar bills.  These are grams of coke....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later on, after reminding the jurors that the case involved roughly $100,000,000 \"generated on the streets of New York that is sent back to Colombia,\" a prosecutor posed a series of rhetorical questions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p>If we're not talking about cocaine, what are we talking about?   Is this from coffee vendors?   Is this money coming from people out in the streets selling Colombian coffee?   Oh, I have had a good day today.  Five hundred thousand dollars, unfortunately, it's all in twenty dollar bills.  Think of the change they had to give.  This is a case about Roberto Juri and Tulio Alzate and Fernando Duenas and Stephen Saccoccia, not Juan Valdez, ladies and gentlemen.  The evidence in this case and the only reasonable inference you can draw is drug money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant did not interject a contemporaneous objection to any of these comments.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It strains credulity to suggest, as Saccoccia does, that the prosecution was arguing that only drugs and coffee come from Colombia.  The remark about coffee vendors was obviously intended to show the unlikelihood that any legitimate business would generate the volume of cash that flowed through appellant's operation.  The quip about Juan Valdez,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> while an unnecessary aside, cannot be said to emphasize emotion over facts.  See Doe, 903 F.2d at 25.   Viewed as a whole, the prosecution's evidence and comments about Colombia provide no basis for disturbing the jury's verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before ending our elaboration we note, as an adscript, that appellant himself is not Colombian, but is of Italian ancestry.  This mitigates one of the most serious dangers of evidence about a person's national origin:  that the jury will believe the defendant is guilty because of stereotyping.  Appellant has not cited any case in which a court has reversed a conviction due to evidence touching upon a national origin not shared by the defendant.  This is not to say that injustice and unfair prejudice may never result from a conviction based on improper use of evidence about the national origin of a defendant's friends or business associates.  But, the ricochet effect of such evidence is likely to do less harm, on average, than the direct impact of evidence about the defendant's country of origin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p>C. The Dog Show.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant faults the district court for admitting evidence that Bosco von Schleudersitz (Bosco), a nine-year-old German shepherd trained to detect narcotics,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> alerted to the presence of drugs in bundles of cash brought to local banks by appellant's henchmen.  At trial Bosco's handler, Sgt. Edward Conley, testified that he took Bosco to a bank in Cranston, Rhode Island on March 23, 1990.  Bosco \"searched\" several areas of the bank, such as the vault and teller stations, and did not react.  Conley then took Bosco to a room in which a bag containing $9,000 was located, and, when he instructed Bosco to search for drugs, the dog \"showed a strong, positive aggressive alert, shaking the bag, ripping it apart, grabbing the money in his mouth, and ripping the money.\"   According to Conley, a similar search, with similar results, took place on April 20, 1990, at a different bank in Johnston, Rhode Island.  In each instance, the currency to which Bosco reacted had been brought to the bank by appellant's associates in order to purchase cashier's checks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To meet this testimony, appellant called two experts who attacked the reliability of Bosco's response.  One of these witnesses, Thomas Knott, testified that the manner in which Conley orchestrated the sniff tests did not properly control against the possibility of a false alert.  The second expert, Dr. James Woodford, criticized the testing protocol because the sniff tests were not verified by chemical field tests.  Woodford also testified as to the widespread contamination of United States currency with illegal drugs and the tenuous nature of the link between a canine alert and a conclusion that particular currency derived from narcotics trafficking (\"[I]f there were drugs on that money, it doesn't mean that it is drug money.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant insists that the probative value of the dog sniff evidence is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect, and that the district court erred in refusing to exclude the evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 403.  This claim deserves serious attention, for recent decisions about the evidentiary value of a trained dog's alert to currency are not uniform.  Compare, e.g., United States v. U.S. Currency, $30,060.00, 39 F.3d 1039, 1041-43 (9th Cir.1994) (noting widespread contamination and concluding that \"the probative value of a positive dog alert in currency forfeiture cases in Los Angeles is significantly diminished\");  United States v. Carr, 25 F.3d 1194, 1215 (3d Cir.)  (Becker, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (stating that \"a substantial portion of United States currency now in circulation is tainted with sufficient traces of controlled substances to cause a trained canine to alert\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 742, 130 L.Ed.2d 643 (1994);  and Jones v. DEA, 819 F.Supp. 698, 721 (M.D.Tenn.1993) (suggesting that \"continued reliance of courts and law enforcement officers on dog sniffs to separate 'legitimate' currency from 'drug-connected' currency is logically indefensible\") with, e.g., United States v. $67,220.00 in U.S. Currency, 957 F.2d 280, 285-86 (6th Cir.1992) (noting that \"a positive dog reaction [to currency] is at least strong evidence of a connection to drugs\");  United States v. $215,300 U.S. Currency, 882 F.2d 417, 419 (9th Cir.1989) (upholding forfeiture based in part on a canine alert to currency), cert. denied, 497 U.S. 1005, 110 S.Ct. 3242, 111 L.Ed.2d 752 (1990);  and United States v. Hernando Ospina, 798 F.2d 1570, 1583 (11th Cir.1986) (finding canine sniff evidence to be both probative and helpful to the jury in concluding that laundered money constitutes drug proceeds).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we reject appellant's asseveration.  We do not think that the district court, based on the information of record in this case, abused its discretion in admitting the canine sniff evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though widespread contamination of currency plainly lessens the impact of dog sniff evidence, a trained dog's alert still retains some probative value.  Ordinary experience suggests that currency used to purchase narcotics is more likely than other currency to have come into contact with drugs.  Here, moreover, the evidence supports an inference that Bosco's frenzied reaction was caused by more than a mere trace of contamination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record contains corroboration of Bosco's olfactory evidence.  Several witnesses testified that ordinary human senses could detect something unusual about the money that appellant's associates brought to the banks.  One teller testified that he occasionally noticed that the money felt \"dusty ... almost floury from pizza dough, that type of feeling.\"   Another teller reported that she noticed an odor or fragrance, akin to that of an orchid.  This evidence, along with Conley's testimony that the dog did not react in other areas of the banks, buttressed the lower court's belief that the dog sniff evidence had probative force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely, though the dog sniff evidence likely bolstered the prosecution's case and served to inculpate the defendant, we are not convinced that it presented a substantial risk of unfair prejudice.  See generally Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d at 156 (\"By design, all evidence is meant to be prejudicial;  it is only unfair prejudice which must be avoided.\").  After all, the court allowed appellant to call two expert witnesses who debunked Bosco's reaction to the currency.  If, on one hand, the jury believed the experts, it doubtless discounted the value of the canine alert.  If, on the other hand, the jury disbelieved appellant's experts, it was entitled to place a greater value on the canine sniff.  See, e.g., Quinones-Pacheco v. American Airlines, Inc., 979 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that \"expert opinion testimony, even if not directly contradicted, is not ordinarily binding on a jury\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, considering the high degree of deference we owe to a district court's balancing of probative value against unfairly prejudicial effects, see Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d at 156, we cannot say that the trial court abused its wide discretion in admitting the evidence of Bosco's reaction to the currency delivered by appellant's associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p>D. Testimony of Juan Carlos Garcia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Juan Carlos Garcia, a participant in the money laundering activities, testified for the government at appellant's trial.  Garcia said that in 1987, while living in the United States, he began working for his brother-in-law, Fernando Duenas.  Following Duenas' orders, Garcia would respond when paged on his beeper, arrange to retrieve a quantity of cash, and deposit the money in one of several bank accounts maintained under the names of Duenas, Duenas' wife (Garcia's sister), or Duenas' brother.  By the end of 1987 the cash had mushroomed from $10,000-$20,000 per shipment to $150,000-$200,000 per shipment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garcia met appellant for the first time in May 1989.  With Duenas' blessing, the two men agreed that appellant would accept bundles of cash from Garcia and send the money to Colombia.  On countless occasions thereafter, appellant received money from Garcia and redirected it to accounts controlled by Duenas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the district court permitted Garcia, over objection, to testify that, in 1988, Duenas told him that a man named \"Caesar\" would call and give him something other than money.  Garcia knew Caesar because Caesar had brought money to him on a previous occasion.  Caesar called and informed Garcia that he would be delivering a kilogram of cocaine.  Subsequently, Caesar handed Garcia a shopping bag containing a block of a granular substance, beige in color.  Garcia tried to sell the merchandise, as directed by Duenas, but he was unable to do so.  He eventually delivered the package to another individual on Duenas' instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant assigns error to the trial court's admission of the testimony anent the package.  The assignment of error has twin foci:  (1) the conversations between Duenas and Garcia, and (2) Caesar's assurance that the package contained cocaine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  We believe that the court lawfully admitted the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Evidence Rules provide that \"a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy\" is not considered hearsay.  Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).  Here, the first prong of the rule is satisfied.  The record contains adequate evidence that Duenas, Garcia, and Caesar were involved in a single conspiracy to launder money.  By joining that conspiracy at a later date, appellant effectively adopted coconspirator declarations previously made.  See United States v. Murphy, 852 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1022, 109 S.Ct. 1145, 103 L.Ed.2d 205 (1989);  see also United States v. Baines, 812 F.2d 41, 42 (1st Cir.1987) (\"[A] conspiracy is like a train.  When a party knowingly steps aboard, he is part of the crew, and assumes conspirator's responsibility for the existing freight--or conduct--regardless of whether he is aware of just what it is composed.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second prong of the rule is also satisfied;  the statements were made during and in furtherance of the very conspiracy that appellant joined.  For one thing, we have held that \"when a number of people combine efforts to manufacture, distribute and retail narcotics, there is a single conspiracy, a 'chain conspiracy,' despite the fact that some of the individuals linking the conspiracy together have not been in direct contact with others in the chain.\"  United States v. Rivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d 1073, 1080 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 910, 109 S.Ct. 3227, 106 L.Ed.2d 576 (1989).  For another thing, money laundering and narcotics trafficking are symbiotic activities, each of which may require the other in order to continue.  Duenas' efforts to have Garcia sell the cocaine for him and the group's ongoing campaign to launder money can rationally be seen as adjacent links in the lengthy chain that binds up the narcotics trafficking cycle.  Thus, the district court acted within its proper province in deeming both activities part of the same conspiracy, and in holding that the attempted narcotics sale was in furtherance of it.  Consequently, the challenged statements were properly admitted under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, moreover, as did the district court, that a statement made by an unavailable declarant<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> falls outside the hearsay exclusion if the statement \"at the time of its making ... so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability ... that a reasonable person in the declarant's position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3).  Duenas' and Caesar's statements to Garcia were tantamount to admissions that they were dealing cocaine.  Because such statements were against the declarants' penal interest, they came within the encincture of Rule 804(b)(3) and were admissible on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant's suggestion that the admission of Garcia's testimony abridged the Confrontation Clause is off base.  It is well settled that a statement falling within a firmly rooted hearsay exception will not be held to violate the Confrontation Clause.  See Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980);  Puleio v. Vose, 830 F.2d 1197, 1204-05 (1st Cir.1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 990, 108 S.Ct. 1297, 99 L.Ed.2d 506 (1988).  It is equally well settled that the exceptions for coconspirator declarations and for declarations against penal interest are both firmly rooted in our jurisprudence.  See Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 183, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 2782-83, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987) (discussing coconspirator exception);  United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 474 n. 4 (1st Cir.1993) (discussing declaration against interest exception), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1073, 127 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p>E. Testimony of Agent Shedd.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the late 1980s, the DEA set up a network of sham corporations ostensibly to provide a money laundering service to underworld elements.  DEA Special Agent James Shedd participated in this reverse sting operation (dubbed \"Operation Pisces\").  Duenas dealt with the Pisces network in 1987 and 1988.  At trial, a prosecutor suggested that Shedd would testify as follows:  \"Mr. Duenas told him that ninety-nine percent of the money that he was turning over to the undercover agent was, in fact, drug money.\"   On the basis of this representation, the lower court denied a motion in limine by which the defense sought to exclude Shedd's testimony regarding Duenas' statements.  Shedd told the jury about thirty-seven transactions in which Duenas supplied cash that the DEA undercover operation laundered for him.  Shedd also described several conversations with Duenas in which Duenas reportedly said that he laundered money for Colombian drug traffickers and \"that ninety-nine percent of the money that money-launderers deal in Bogota comes from narcotics proceeds.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During cross-examination, appellant's counsel challenged Shedd about this statement.  Shedd and Duenas conversed in Spanish, and some of their conversations had been recorded.  Defense counsel called Shedd's attention to one such conversation. The translation indicated that Duenas made the contested comment during a discussion in which he explained that, although it was against the law, foreign currency routinely circulated in Colombia.  He apparently added:  \"Logically, the [foreign] currency that circulates the most over there ... is the dollar ... which ninety-nine percent of it comes from drug dealing.\"   Shedd responded that his direct testimony had been premised not on a single discussion, but on an overall impression gained from a lengthy conversation with Duenas.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  Appellant then moved to strike Shedd's testimony.  Judge Torres denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant maintains that the district court made no fewer than four errors in connection with this testimony.  First, appellant posits that Duenas' statements were barred by the hearsay rule.  This claim fails.  The court was warranted in finding that these were coconspirator declarations and, thus, admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).  See, e.g., Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1180;  Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 714-15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's second contention is that Duenas' statement, in its true form, was irrelevant because it was nothing more than a gross generalization about the Colombian economy.  We disagree.  Though courts are sometimes cautious about admitting abstract data as proof of what actually happened in an individual case, a percentage like \"ninety-nine percent\" is quite powerful, and far surpasses the usual test that evidence is relevant if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 401.  Trial courts are afforded wide discretion in determining whether evidence clears this low threshold, see United States v. Tierney, 760 F.2d 382, 387 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 843, 106 S.Ct. 131, 88 L.Ed.2d 108 (1985), and we will disturb an exercise of that discretion only if manifest abuse appears, see Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1194;  United States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 101 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 844, 108 S.Ct. 137, 98 L.Ed.2d 94 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this deferential standard, the district court acted within its lawful powers in deeming Duenas' statements relevant to the issue of whether the money appellant laundered was in fact derived from narcotics trafficking.  Duenas' remark, even in the diluted form that was heralded on cross-examination, has at least some probative value in ascertaining whether the drug trade was the source of the funds that appellant washed, much as the fact that a lake is contaminated has some probative value in ascertaining whether a stream that feeds the lake is contaminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's third sally alleges error in Shedd's explanation that his initial testimony about Duenas' statement was based on an overall impression from several hours of conversation.  Although a witness is generally not permitted to testify about his subjective interpretations of what has been said by another person, he may do so if his opinion is rationally based on his perception and is helpful either to an understanding of his testimony or to the determination of a fact in issue.  See United States v. Cox, 633 F.2d 871, 875 (9th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 844, 102 S.Ct. 159, 70 L.Ed.2d 130 (1981).  In this case, we conclude that the district court acted lawfully in leaving the testimony intact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shedd tendered his explanation of Duenas' statement in direct response to a question by appellant's counsel on cross-examination.  The answer was not followed by a timely objection or motion to strike.  While appellant challenged Shedd's qualifications to offer an opinion about Duenas' state of mind in a subsequent motion to strike, this was too late.  See United States v. Moore, 923 F.2d 910, 915 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that Evidence Rule 103 requires that objections be made at the time evidence is offered);  United States v. Parodi, 703 F.2d 768, 783 (4th Cir.1983) (same).  The proper time to have registered an objection to Shedd's explanation was immediately after it was uttered.  Accordingly, any objection to the explanation has been waived.  And, moreover, even if the court erred in permitting the answer to stand, it looms as harmless beyond all doubt in the context of a very efficacious cross-examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's final contention is that the prosecution knowingly offered Shedd's testimony despite having a transcript that refuted it, and, to make a bad situation worse, deliberately withheld the transcript from the defense.  Having carefully examined the record, we find no valid reason to conclude that the prosecution intentionally mischaracterized Shedd's proposed testimony during the in limine hearing, and no hint of prosecutorial misconduct in the handling of the transcript.  At any rate, it is perfectly clear that defense counsel obtained the unexpurgated transcript in ample time to conduct a very effective cross-examination on the following day.  There was no prejudice and, hence, no reversible error.  See Devin, 918 F.2d at 290.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p>F. The Wiretap Tapes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court allowed the prosecution to introduce tape recordings of two conversations in which Saccoccia's employees made reference to drugs.  The tapes are not entirely audible, and the parties disagree about what was said during two potentially significant conversations.  The government asserts that, in a discussion that took place at Trend's offices, Kenneth Saccoccio referred to cash that he and Hurley were counting as \"fuckin' drug money.\"   Appellant claims that this portion of the tape was inaudible.  The other conversation took place at Saccoccia Coin Company.  In it, Stanley Cirella spoke to Stephen Pizzo about an ongoing investigation of appellant's organization.  According to the government, Cirella declared that \"he\"--a pronoun that we take in context to refer to Saccoccia--had told him that \"they [the authorities] ain't doin' this [conducting the investigation] because of the coke, they're doin' this because of the washing of money.\"   Appellant contends that Cirella said \"gold\" rather than \"coke.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue on appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion in allowing the taped conversations to be presented to the jury in conjunction with the government's transcript.  In appellant's view, the inaudible portions of the tapes are so critical as to make the rest more misleading than helpful.  See United States v. Carbone, 798 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir.1986).  Having listened to the tapes, see United States v. Carbone, 880 F.2d 1500, 1503 (1st Cir.1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1078, 110 S.Ct. 1131, 107 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1990), we believe that they are reasonably audible and that the judge appropriately left their interpretation to the jury.  What was or was not said during a tape-recorded conversation is ordinarily a question of fact, not a question of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's fallback position is that, even if the government accurately transcribed the tapes, the lower court erred in failing to tell the jury that any statements about the source of the laundered money were relevant only to the speakers' subjective beliefs.  This position hinges on the premise that, in the absence of a concinnous foundation showing the speakers' knowledge, the comments cannot constitute proof vis-a-vis Stephen Saccoccia (who did not participate in the discourse) as to whether the money in fact emanated from drug transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with appellant's premise for two reasons.  First, Evidence Rule 104(b) provides that \"[w]hen the relevancy of evidence depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court shall admit it upon, or subject to, the introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding of the fulfillment of the condition.\"   In addressing foundational issues, the trial judge acts as a gatekeeper, examining the evidence and deciding \"whether the jury could reasonably find the conditional fact ... by a preponderance of the evidence.\"  Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 690, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 1501, 99 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988).  The conditional fact may be based on \"reasonable inference from the circumstantial evidence.\"  Onujiogu v. United States, 817 F.2d 3, 5 (1st Cir.1987);  see, e.g., Veranda Beach Club Ltd. Partnership v. Western Sur. Co., 936 F.2d 1364, 1372 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the wide discretion afforded to trial judges in deciding whether an adequate foundation has been laid, see Real v. Hogan, 828 F.2d 58, 64 (1st Cir.1987), we think that Judge Torres acted unexceptionably in determining that the jury could rationally infer that appellant's employees would not refer to the cash as \"drug money\" without some basis in fact.  The men who made the statements were substantially involved in appellant's operation and could easily have had opportunities to learn of the money's origins.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have indicated, there is a second reason why appellant is mistaken insofar as he sees personal knowledge about the source of the funds as a prerequisite to general admissibility of the comments.  Both statements were made by coconspirators and are thus admissible under Evidence Rule 801(d)(2)(E) without a showing of personal knowledge.  See United States v. Goins, 11 F.3d 441, 443-44 (4th Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2107, 128 L.Ed.2d 668 (1994) (holding that the personal knowledge requirement of Evidence Rule 602 \"does not apply to statements of a co-conspirator admissible as non-hearsay under Rule 801(d)(2)(E)\");  cf. Brookover v. Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hosp., 893 F.2d 411, 415-18 (1st Cir.1990) (finding no requirement of personal knowledge for admission of a statement under Rule 801(d)(2)(D)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these two reasons the challenged statements were properly before the jury, and the court acted appropriately in refusing appellant's proposed limiting instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p>G. The Sufficiency of the Evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the evidence as a whole and keeping in mind that the prosecution's burden of proof can be satisfied by either direct or circumstantial evidence, see O'Brien, 14 F.3d at 706, we conclude that a rational factfinder could determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the money appellant laundered was in fact derived from the narcotics trade.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rehashing the evidence would serve no useful purpose.  We do take special note, however, that appellant's money-washing operation matched Agent Semesky's description of how Colombian drug rings traditionally laundered ill-gotten gains, and that, as the district court observed, it is difficult to conceive of any non-narcotics-related business that could create a comparable cascade of creased currency.  That the waves of cold cash typically appeared in well-worn bills of small denomination makes the tie tighter.  Then, too, the jury heard competent evidence that Duenas, who furnished money for appellant to launder, himself performed monetary ablutions for narcotics traffickers (and, on one occasion, supplied cocaine for an associate to sell).  The canine alert to currency that appellant's associates had gathered furnished some added support for the theory that the money emanated from drug sales.  Finally, appellant's own employees suggested on two occasions that the washed funds were linked to narcotics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken in the ensemble, these pieces of evidence provide an adequate foundation on which the jury could build a finding that appellant laundered drug money.  Jurors, after all, are not expected to resist commonsense inferences based on the realities of human experience.  See Veranda Beach Club, 936 F.2d at 1372 (\"The law is not so struthious as to compel a factfinder to ignore that which is perfectly obvious.\");  United States v. Ingraham, 832 F.2d 229, 240 (1st Cir.1987) (similar), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1009, 108 S.Ct. 1738, 100 L.Ed.2d 202 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. FORFEITURE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court bifurcated appellant's trial, separating the substantive criminal charges from the forfeiture claims.  Appellant waived his right to trial by jury on the latter counts.  All counsel assured the judge that they had no additional evidence to present at the second anticipated phase of the trial and, therefore, that the hearing on forfeiture would \"be purely a matter of legal argument.\"   Accordingly, the judge scheduled arguments for March 26, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the assigned date, appellant was before a California court in connection with a separate action.  His counsel objected to proceeding in appellant's absence.  See Herring v. New York, 422 U.S. 853, 863-65, 95 S.Ct. 2550, 2556-57, 45 L.Ed.2d 593 (1975) (remarking a defendant's constitutional right to make a closing argument, even in a bench trial);  Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(a) (\"The defendant shall be present at ... every stage of the trial including ... the imposition of sentence....\").  Specifically, counsel stated that (1) he required appellant's assistance \"in responding to whatever it is the government may say about the evidence as it relates to the law that's going to be argued,\" and (2) appellant might wish to exercise his right to make a closing statement.  The court then offered to proceed on the understanding that appellant's counsel could make incremental arguments at the sentencing hearing, with appellant present.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  When counsel persisted in his original position, the court terminated the session.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The disposition hearing was held on May 12, 1993.  Appellant was present throughout.  The district court determined that he should forfeit all the money laundered during the life of the conspiracy, and, using bank records, fixed the amount at $136,344,231.86.  See United States v. Saccoccia, 823 F.Supp. 994, 1006 (D.R.I.1993).  At the government's urging, the court subsequently amended the forfeiture order to specify substitute assets for forfeiture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a>  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1963(m) (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant assigns error.  He strives to persuade us, inter alia, that applicable extradition doctrines barred forfeiture;  that the court ignored the strictures of due process;  and that the forfeiture order swept too broadly.  We are not convinced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p>A. Extradition/Forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant asserts that the forfeiture entered against him violates the rule of specialty because it is tantamount to prosecution and conviction for an offense on which extradition was neither sought nor granted.  He also suggests that the principle of dual criminality prohibits the forfeiture because Swiss law does not render a defendant criminally liable for forfeiture by reason of unlawful money transfers.  These initiatives fail because they ignore the irresistible conclusion that, at least for present purposes, criminal forfeiture is a punishment, not a separate criminal offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that the genealogy of modern criminal forfeiture is important.  The device is born out of the mating of two historically distinct traditions.  One parent is civil forfeiture, an in rem proceeding rooted in the notion that property used in, or intimately associated with, criminal activity acquires a taint, and that such property is therefore forfeitable even if not owned by the miscreant.  See United States v. Sandini, 816 F.2d 869, 872 (3d Cir.1987).  The second parent is old-hat criminal forfeiture, which traditionally operated as an incident of a felony conviction in personam against a convicted defendant, requiring him to forfeit his property to the crown.  See United States v. Nichols, 841 F.2d 1485, 1486 (10th Cir.1988).  The forfeiture provisions of RICO combine both traditions because they act in personam against the defendant, yet require a nexus between the forfeited property and the crime.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>  See id. at 1486-88 (reviewing historical aspects of forfeiture);  Saccoccia, 823 F.Supp. at 1001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Partially as a result of this mixed heritage, courts have struggled to categorize the resultant hybrid--modern criminal forfeiture--as either a punishment for, or an element of, a criminal offense.  The majority view regards criminal forfeiture for narcotics offenses under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 853 as part of the punishment imposed on a defendant.  See, e.g., United States v. Elgersma, 971 F.2d 690, 694 (11th Cir.1992) (holding that \"criminal forfeiture is part of the sentencing process and not an element of the crime itself\");  United States v. Hernandez-Escarsega, 886 F.2d 1560, 1576-77 (9th Cir.1989) (similar), cert. denied, 497 U.S. 1003, 110 S.Ct. 3237, 111 L.Ed.2d 748 (1990);  Sandini, 816 F.2d at 875 (similar).  Other straws in the wind blow in the same direction.  See, e.g., Alexander v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2766, 2772, 125 L.Ed.2d 441 (1993) (characterizing a RICO forfeiture order against a pornography merchant as \"a punishment for past criminal conduct\");  United States v. Kingsley, 851 F.2d 16, 18 n. 2 (1st Cir.1988) (noting in dictum that \"in personam criminal forfeiture ... is intended to directly punish persons convicted of a criminal offense by forcing them to forfeit the proceeds obtained as a result of that offense\").  Withal, there remains some nagging doubt about whether forfeiture is strictly a punishment as opposed to a separate substantive charge.  See, e.g., Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chtd. v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 628 n. 5, 109 S.Ct. 2646, 2654 n. 5, 105 L.Ed.2d 528 (1989) (stating in dictum that \"forfeiture is a substantive charge in the indictment against a defendant\");  Fed.R.Crim.P. 31(e) advisory committee's note (noting committee's assumption that \"the amount of the interest or property subject to criminal forfeiture is an element of the offense to be alleged and proved\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We resolve that doubt favorably to the government to the extent necessary to rebut Saccoccia's claims.  Thus, we hold that, for purposes of extradition law, forfeiture is neither a free-standing criminal offense nor an element of a racketeering offense under RICO, but is simply an incremental punishment for that proscribed conduct.  Consequently, a defendant may be subjected to a forfeiture order even if extradition was not specifically granted in respect to the forfeiture allegations.  We base this ruling primarily on three pillars:  the weight of authority counsels in this direction;  the punitive aspects of criminal forfeiture predominate (among other things, RICO forfeiture retains the functional traits of a punishment since it is definitively imposed only after the defendant's guilt has otherwise been determined);  and, finally, treating criminal forfeiture as a punishment in the extradition milieu is consistent with the emphasis that the doctrine of dual criminality places on the unlawfulness of the defendant's conduct, and, correspondingly, on the lack of any requirement that a crime have identical elements or penalties in the two jurisdictions, see Collins, 259 U.S. at 312, 42 S.Ct. at 470-71;  Levy, 905 F.2d at 328.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows, therefore, that appellant was properly subjected to a criminal forfeiture order even if he was not extradited on forfeiture charges and even if Swiss law does not provide for criminal forfeiture under comparable circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p>B. Procedural Aspects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also declaims that the procedure employed with regard to the forfeiture order deprived him of four intertwined rights:  the right to present a closing argument, the right to be present to assist counsel during the closing argument, the right to entry of a verdict of forfeiture, and the right to be present for entry of a verdict.  This quadrant of complaints is unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first two grievances are not supported by the record.  Even though appellant was absent on March 26, the court offered his counsel the opportunity to make further arguments at the disposition hearing (at which appellant was in attendance).  Affording appellant this opportunity satisfied his right to make a closing statement and his right personally to assist counsel.  The fact that appellant chose not to avail himself of the afforded opportunity is beside the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's next contention arises out of the idea that the court violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(b) and 31(e) by ordering forfeiture without entering a special verdict.  Because appellant did not object to the district court's decision to make an oral forfeiture order followed by a written decision, however, our review is limited to a hunt for plain error.  See United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 972-73 (1st Cir.1995);  Griffin, 818 F.2d at 99.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Rule 31(e) requires that a special verdict be returned when the indictment or information contains a forfeiture allegation.  But, Rule 31(a) makes it transpicuously clear that this requirement is geared to jury trials.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 31(a) (stating that the verdict \"shall be returned by the jury to the judge in open court\").  When the judge is the factfinder, the procedure for making factual determinations is governed by Fed.R.Crim.P. 23(c).  That rule provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p>In a case tried without a jury the court shall make a general finding and shall in addition, on request made before the general finding, find the facts specially.  Such findings may be oral.  If an opinion or memorandum of decision is filed, it will be sufficient if the findings of fact appear therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 23(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the judge entered an oral order, followed very shortly by a written memorandum limning his findings of fact.  In our opinion, this procedure did not constitute plain error.  See, e.g., Gibbs v. Buck, 307 U.S. 66, 78, 59 S.Ct. 725, 732, 83 L.Ed. 1111 (1939);  see also Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp., 862 F.2d 890, 895 (1st Cir.1988) (observing that reversal \"would be an empty ritual\" once the lower court had remedied its original error and belatedly made written findings).  Thus, we deny appellant's request that the forfeiture order be vacated on this score.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p>C. Extent of the Forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant maintains that the \"proceeds\" subject to RICO forfeiture should not include all the funds laundered by his organization, but only the organization's profit.  He does not dwell on this thesis, instead electing to incorporate the codefendants' argument to this effect.  We, too, prefer not to linger.  The district court treated this contention at length, and we find ourselves in substantial agreement with the reasoning explicated in that court's opinion.  See Saccoccia, 823 F.Supp. at 1001-03.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. SENTENCING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without objection, the district court predicated its sentencing calculations on the November 1, 1992 edition of the federal sentencing guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>  See United States v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d 1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir.1990) (\"Barring any ex post facto problem, a defendant is to be punished according to the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing.\").  The court compiled appellant's criminal history score and placed him in category II.  Turning to the other side of the grid, the court started with the money laundering guideline.  Since appellant had been convicted under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956(a)(2)(A), he had a base offense level (BOL) of 23.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2S1.1(a)(1).  The court then added 13 levels because the value of the laundered funds exceeded $100,000,000, see id. Sec. 2S1.1(b)(2)(N), and three levels premised on a finding that appellant knew (or believed) that the funds were derived from narcotics sales, see id. Sec. 2S1.1(b)(1).  Finding appellant to be the organizer and leader of the money laundering enterprise, the court escalated four levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(a).  Finally, citing appellant's unsuccessful attempt to use his medical history as a device for extracting a continuance, see supra note 2, and stressing that the feigned illness occurred shortly after the court had denied appellant's request for postponement of the trial on other grounds, Judge Torres went up two levels for obstructing justice.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1.  These calculations yielded an adjusted offense level of 45 for the money laundering counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then turned to the RICO conspiracy count.  Inasmuch as the applicable guideline, id. Sec. 2E1.1, prescribes the use of an offense level equal to the greater of 19 or the adjusted offense level for the underlying conduct (here, money laundering), appellant's adjusted offense level remained unchanged.  The court took a similar look at the Travel Act counts with a similar result (the applicable guideline, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2E1.2, directs the use of an offense level equal to the greater of 6 or the adjusted offense level for the underlying conduct).  At the bottom line, then, the counts of conviction produced a total offense level (TOL) of 45.  See id. Secs. 3D1.2(d), 3D1.3(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A TOL of 43 or higher requires the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment regardless of the offender's criminal history category.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>  See U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A (Sentencing Table).  However, the offenses of conviction in this case all carry maximum sentences less than life.  When, as in this instance, the maximum sentence for each offense of conviction is lower than the minimum punishment mandated by the applicable GSR, the guidelines require imposition of consecutive sentences \"to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment.\"   Id. Sec. 5G1.2(d).  Applying this principle, the district court concluded that sentences on the several counts of conviction should run consecutively to the extent necessary to effectuate a life sentence.  Because the sentencing guidelines prescribe life in prison for persons who, like appellant, sport a TOL of 43 or higher, whereas all the counts of convictions have statutory maxima that are expressed in terms of a finite number of years, the court imposed the longest possible sentence on each count and ran the sentences consecutive to one another.  The result:  an incarcerative sentence of 660 years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant assails this sentence on manifold grounds.  His principal lines of attack are that mandatory life sentences under the guidelines are illegal;  that the district court misconceived its authority in imposing sentence;  that the court violated the Ex Post Facto Clause;  and that the court erred in making an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p>A. The Mandatory Life Sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that the imposition of a mandatory life sentence is illegal both because Congress disavowed consecutive sentences and because, in all events, a life sentence in the circumstances of this case insults the Eighth Amendment's proscription against cruel and unusual punishment.  Neither of these contentions is convincing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Congressional Intent.   It is apodictic that the sentencing guidelines cannot sweep more broadly than Congress' grant of power to the Sentencing Commission permits.  See United States v. Cooper, 962 F.2d 339, 342 (4th Cir.1992).  Thus, if a guideline conflicts with a statute, the latter prevails.  See Stinson v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1918-19, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993);  United States v. Fiore, 983 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1830, 123 L.Ed.2d 458 (1993).  Appellant perceives such a collision here.  In his view, Congress mandated a strong statutory preference for concurrent sentences, and the Sentencing Commission's instruction that fixed-year sentences should be imposed consecutively to effectuate life imprisonment, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.2(d), must yield the right of way to Congress' expressed preference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant hinges this conclusion on Congress' enactment of two statutory provisions, namely, 28 U.S.C. Secs. 994(l)(2) &amp; 994(v) (1988).  We think he reads the cited statutes with much too sanguine an eye.  Neither statute prohibits the imposition of consecutive sentences.  Rather, section 994(l )(2) merely declares the \"general inappropriateness\" of consecutive sentences for a conspiracy and its object offense, and section 994(v) merely directs the Commission to \"limit[ ] consecutive terms of imprisonment\" for convictions on related general and specific offenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a>  While these statutes arguably imply a general congressional preference for concurrent sentences, they do not, as appellant intimates, outlaw consecutive sentences.  On the contrary, the statutory scheme leaves ample room for courts, following the lead of the Sentencing Commission, to deploy consecutive sentences in appropriate circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two observations show the virtual inevitability of this conclusion.  In the first place, U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.2 became effective only with the consent of Congress.  We consider this to be powerful evidence that Congress itself saw no inconsistency between the guideline provision and the statutory scheme.  See United States v. Lueddeke, 908 F.2d 230, 233 (7th Cir.1990).  In the second place, Congress minced no words in ceding the Commission discretion to determine what particular circumstances would trigger the need for consecutive sentences.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3584(a) (1988) (providing in part that \"if multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant at the same time ... the terms may run concurrently or consecutively\");  see also United States v. Flowers, 995 F.2d 315, 316-17 (1st Cir.1993) (holding that section 3584(a) authorizes the Sentencing Commission \"to write guidelines that say when, and to what extent, [incarcerative] terms should be concurrent or consecutive\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not flog a dead horse.  Because Congress gave the Sentencing Commission expansive authority to promulgate guidelines specifying when sentences should be consecutive or concurrent, and then directed sentencing courts to refer to the guidelines in order to determine whether \"multiple sentences to terms of imprisonment should be ordered to run concurrently or consecutively,\" 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(a)(1)(D), the court below possessed the power--indeed, the responsibility--to impose a series of consecutive sentences effectuating the clearly expressed command of U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Eighth Amendment.   Appellant bemoans his sentence as mocking the Eighth Amendment's proscription against cruel and unusual punishments.  This ululation is more cry than wool.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983), the Supreme Court held that \"as a matter of principle ... a criminal sentence must be proportionate to the crime for which the defendant has been convicted.\"  Id. at 290, 103 S.Ct. at 3009.   This opinion did not usher in a regime of strict proportionality review applicable to all criminal sentences, for the Court restricted its holding to penalties that are \"grossly\" or \"significantly\" disproportionate to the underlying criminal activity.  Id. at 288, 303, 103 S.Ct. at 3008, 3016-17.   The Court did not in any way, shape, or form, then or thereafter, suggest that the Eighth Amendment requires a precise calibration of crime and punishment in noncapital cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Solem looms as the high water mark of the proportionality approach.  In the pre-Solem era, the Court consistently recognized the legislature's primacy in determining the appropriate punishment for criminal behavior, see e.g., Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U.S. 263, 274, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 1139, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980);  Hutto v. Davis, 454 U.S. 370, 374, 102 S.Ct. 703, 705-06, 70 L.Ed.2d 556 (1982) (per curiam), and the Court has sounded much the same note in the post-Solem era, see, e.g., Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 962, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 2684, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991) (opinion of Scalia, J.)  (expressing the view that the length of the sentence actually imposed in respect to a felony conviction is entirely a matter of legislative prerogative);  id. at 998-99, 111 S.Ct. at 2703-04 (opinion of Kennedy, J.)  (similar;  listing cases).  Throughout, the Justices have made it quite clear that strict judicial scrutiny of statutorily mandated penalties in noncapital cases is not to be countenanced.  See, e.g., Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386, 393, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 1284-85, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958).  The Constitution does not require legislatures to balance crimes and punishments according to any single standard, or to achieve perfect equipoise.  Indeed, the Solem Court itself acknowledged the need for judges to \"grant substantial deference to the broad authority that legislatures necessarily possess in determining the types and limits of punishment for crimes.\"  Solem, 463 U.S. at 290, 103 S.Ct. at 3009-10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court also has sounded two cautionary notes.  First, \"[t]he inherent nature of our federal system\" necessarily produces \"a wide range of constitutional sentences.\"  Id. at 291 n. 17, 103 S.Ct. at 3010 n. 17;  see also Rummel, 445 U.S. at 282, 100 S.Ct. at 1143.   Second, \"Eighth Amendment judgments should not be, or appear to be, merely the subjective views of individual [judges];  judgment should be informed by objective factors to the maximum possible extent.\"  Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584, 592, 97 S.Ct. 2861, 2866, 53 L.Ed.2d 982 (1977);  accord Solem, 463 U.S. at 290, 103 S.Ct. at 3009-10.   For these reasons, \"a reviewing court rarely will be required to engage in extended analysis to determine that a sentence is not constitutionally disproportionate.\"  Id. at 290 n. 16, 103 S.Ct. at 3010 n. 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Justices' most recent pronouncements fully support the conclusion that serious crimes may result in the imposition of sentences as severe as life imprisonment without working any constitutional insult.  In Solem, the Court explicitly contrasted the defendant's \"relatively minor\" offenses, id. at 296-97, 103 S.Ct. at 3013, with \"very serious offenses\" such as drug trafficking, id. at 299, 103 S.Ct. at 3014, and suggested that statutes providing for life imprisonment might be applied constitutionally to inveterate drug dealers or other violent criminals, id. at 299 n. 26, 103 S.Ct. at 3014 n. 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Harmelin, fairly read, emits an even clearer signal.  There, the Court considered the application of the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole imposed in a narcotics case against a defendant who possessed more than 650 grams of cocaine.  See Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 961, 111 S.Ct. at 2684.   Justice Scalia, in an opinion joined on this point by the Chief Justice, rejected the extended proportionality analysis developed in Solem and declared that nothing in the Eighth Amendment guarantees proportionate sentences.  See id. at 965, 111 S.Ct. at 2686.   He concluded that \"Solem was simply wrong,\" id., because the Eighth Amendment provided protection with respect to modes and methods of punishment, not the length of incarceration, see id. at 966-67, 111 S.Ct. at 2686-87.   Justice Kennedy, joined by Justices O'Connor and Souter, wrote a concurring opinion that, when combined with Justice Scalia's opinion, aggregated the five votes necessary to uphold Harmelin's sentence.  Justice Kennedy thought that stare decisis counseled adherence to a \"narrow proportionality principle,\" id. at 996, 111 S.Ct. at 2702, one that recognizes that the \"Eighth Amendment does not require strict proportionality between crime and sentence.  Rather, it forbids only extreme sentences that are 'grossly disproportionate' to the crime,\" id. at 1001, 111 S.Ct. at 2705 (quoting Solem ).   After noting the grave harm to society wreaked by illegal drugs, Justice Kennedy found nothing \"grossly disproportionate\" in either the length nor the mandatory nature of Harmelin's sentence.  See id. at 1001-08, 111 S.Ct. at 2705-09.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A dispassionate application of Harmelin to this case defeats appellant's attack on the constitutionality of his sentence.  Although the Justices in Harmelin disagreed on the status of proportionality review under the Eighth Amendment, a majority found insufficient disproportionality to forestall a mandatory sentence of life without parole for possession of over 650 grams of cocaine.  With this as a reference point, appellant's sentence can hardly be deemed \"grossly disproportionate\" to the underlying conduct--conduct which, by all accounts, significantly facilitated narcotics trafficking on a Brobdingnagian scale.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more would be supererogatory.  We know that Harmelin is not an aberration;  in Hutto, another case that teaches much the same lesson, the Court upheld, against a proportionality attack, a sentence of 40 years in prison for possessing nine ounces of marijuana with the intent to distribute it.  454 U.S. at 374, 102 S.Ct. at 705-06.   We also know that Congress--not the judiciary--is vested with the authority to define, and attempt to solve, the societal problems created by drug trafficking across national and state borders.  The Supreme Court has made it plain that the use of severe penalties as part of the legislative armamentarium does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  See, e.g., Harmelin, supra;  Hutto, supra;  see also United States v. Munoz, 36 F.3d 1229, 1239 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1164, 130 L.Ed.2d 1120 (1995).  Under this light, the flimsiness of appellant's Eighth Amendment challenge becomes apparent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p>B. The Refusal to Depart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general rule, \"a district court's refusal to depart, regardless of the suggested direction, is not appealable.\"  United States v. Romolo, 937 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir.1991).  There is, of course, an exception that applies \"if the record supports an inference that the sentencing court's failure to depart did not represent an exercise of factfinding or discretion, but was instead the product of a court's miscalculation about whether it possessed the authority to depart.\"  United States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288, 292 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 224, 121 L.Ed.2d 161 (1992);  accord United States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 618-19 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 919, 130 L.Ed.2d 799 (1995).  Appellant attempts to wedge his case within the dimensions of this exception on the ground that the sentencing court believed, erroneously, that it lacked discretion to impose concurrent sentences.  This claim misconstrues the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Quinones, 26 F.3d 213 (1st Cir.1994), we held that a court may deviate from U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.2 \"if, and to the extent that, circumstances exist that warrant a departure.\"  Id. at 216.   Although Quinones had not yet been decided when Judge Torres sentenced Saccoccia, we are satisfied that he understood this principle and anticipated our holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, appellant argued that the district court had authority under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3584(a) to depart downward and impose concurrent sentences on all counts notwithstanding the terms of U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.2.  The court acknowledged that it possessed such authority, but it concluded (appropriately, we think) that because the guidelines required consecutive sentences in appellant's case, it could only impose concurrent sentences if the case satisfied the conditions for a downward departure, that is, if it found mitigating circumstances not considered by the Sentencing Commission.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0.  Discerning no such mitigation, the court eschewed a downward departure.  In other words, the court realized that it could impose concurrent sentences as a specie of downward departure, cf. Quinones, 26 F.3d at 216 (authorizing the imposition of consecutive sentences as a specie of upward departure), but it chose not to do so because, in its judgment, the facts did not warrant a downward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This ends our jaunt.  Inasmuch as the district court correctly understood that it possessed the power to depart from the GSR but made a discretionary decision to refrain from exercising that power, we lack jurisdiction to address appellant's claim.  See Pierro, 32 F.3d at 619 (explaining that a discretionary refusal to depart by a judge who recognizes his power, but who says, in effect, that the case before him is not \"sufficiently unusual to warrant departing,\" is not reviewable on appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p>C. Ex Post Facto Concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant seeks to incorporate an argument advanced on appeal by his codefendants to the effect that the district court's sentencing determinations abridged the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const. art.  I, Sec. 9, cl. 3.  In appellant's view, the court's error lay in increasing his TOL based on an amendment to the money laundering guideline, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2S1.1(b)(1),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a> that did not become effective until November 1, 1991--during the lifespan of the conspiracy, but subsequent to the last proven instance of money laundering.  This criticism fails for at least three reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, appellant did not broach the topic at sentencing.  He has, therefore, waived it.  See United States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 55 (1st Cir.1991) (explaining that \"in connection with sentencing as in other contexts, ... arguments not seasonably addressed to the trial court may not be raised for the first time in an appellate venue\");  accord, e.g., United States v. Piper, 35 F.3d 611, 620 n. 6 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1118, 130 L.Ed.2d 1082 (1995);  Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1202.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p172\">\n      <span class=\"num\">172</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, appellant was not only the mastermind of the money laundering ring, but also its chief executive officer, comptroller, sales manager, and director of operations.  The weight of the evidence heavily preponderates in favor of a finding that appellant knew and believed of the money's origins.  Indeed, appellant wholly fails to demonstrate how and where the district court erred in determining his level of \"knowledge or belief,\" or why the guideline revision makes any real difference in his case.   This failure--typical of litigants who attempt to incorporate by reference arguments which, if made in earnest, deserve individualized attention--is fatal to appellant's cause.  See, e.g., Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17 (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p173\">\n      <span class=\"num\">173</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, even if appellant were somehow to surmount the two hurdles we have just described, he could prevail only upon a showing of plain error.  See United States v. Olano, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-78, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993);  United States v. Olivier-Diaz, 13 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.1993).  Given the strict requirements that attend amelioration under the plain error doctrine, and the substantial discretion invested in appellate courts with regard to the doctrine's use, see generally Taylor, 54 F.3d at 972-73 plain error is plainly absent here.  Put bluntly, we detect nothing in appellant's belated assault that causes us to question \"the fundamental fairness or basic integrity of the proceeding below in [any] major respect.\"  Id. at 973.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p>D. Obstruction of Justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's fourth line of attack suggests that the sentencing court erred in elevating his offense level for obstruction of justice.  This sortie is moot.  The only practical effect of the adjustment is to raise the TOL from 43 to 45.  Since life imprisonment is mandatory at or above TOL 43, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.2;  see also U.S.S.G. Sec. 5A, comment.  (n. 2) (\"An offense level of more than 43 is to be treated as an offense level of 43.\"), canceling the enhancement would accomplish nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is this court's settled practice not to address an allegedly erroneous sentencing computation if, and to the extent that, correcting it will neither change the defendant's sentence nor relieve him from some unfair collateral consequence.  See, e.g., Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1199;  United States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d 601, 604 (1st Cir.1990).  We believe that this philosophy is fully applicable in a situation where, as here, correction of an allegedly erroneous finding would not eliminate the certainty of a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.  Courts should not tilt at windmills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p177\">\n      <span class=\"num\">177</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Having scoured the record and carefully considered appellant's entire asseverational array (including some arguments not specifically discussed herein), we detect no reversible error.  As we see it, appellant was lawfully extradited, fairly tried, justly convicted, and appropriately punished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p178\">\n      <span class=\"num\">178</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The conspirators sought to avoid the currency transaction reporting requirements applicable to large cash transactions, see, e.g., 31 U.S.C. Sec. 5313 (1988);  31 C.F.R. Sec. 103.22(a)(1) (1994), by subdividing the cash into units of less than $10,000.  The process of breaking down a large amount of cash into smaller, unreportable amounts--a criminal act when done to avoid the reporting requirements, see 31 U.S.C.A. Sec. 5324 (West Supp.1995)--is called \"smurfing.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court held a hearing regarding appellant's professed ailments.  Appellant had undergone a laminectomy at age 14 and had been hospitalized repeatedly during the next 20 years.  He suffered a relapse while he was incarcerated in Switzerland, necessitating bed rest and medication.  After being returned to the United States, appellant claimed to have reinjured his back.  He also claimed that, on the eve of trial, a prison guard assaulted him, aggravating his condition.  The court heard testimony from three physicians and concluded that \"there [were] no objective findings by any doctor that would confirm the existence of any physical problem that would account for [appellant's current] complaints of pain.\"   Accordingly, the court refused to grant a continuance</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The first trial proceeded as to the other defendants.  The jury returned its verdict on December 18, 1992, convicting Donna Saccoccia, Vincent Hurley, James Saccoccio, Kenneth Saccoccio, Stanley Cirella and Anthony DeMarco on the RICO conspiracy count, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(d), and finding each of them guilty on certain other counts.  Donna Saccoccia was convicted of 47 counts of money laundering under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1957 and 13 counts of money laundering under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956(a)(2);  Hurley was convicted of one count of structuring transactions to avoid currency reporting requirements, see 31 U.S.C. Sec. 5324(a)(3), and one count of interstate travel in aid of racketeering, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1952;  the two Saccoccios and Cirella were likewise convicted of structuring violations under 31 U.S.C. Sec. 5324(a)(3);  and Anthony DeMarco was convicted of filing false currency transaction reports in violation of 31 U.S.C. Sec. 5324(a)(2)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The five waived asseverations comprise:  (1) whether the CTR charges, and the evidence engendered thereby, violated the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination;  (2) whether the district court's jury instructions overlooked the teachings of Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525 (1993);  (3) whether the court erred in instructing the jury that coconspirators' knowledge could be established by evidence of willful blindness;  (4) whether the court erred in determining the scope of the charged conspiracy;  and (5) whether the value of the washed funds as calculated for sentencing purposes improperly included revenue that the government conceded was legitimate in origin.  In all events, none of these contentions appears to have much bite</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The charges laid against appellant in the superseding indictment closely paralleled those contained in the original bill.  Specifically, the grand jury accused appellant of RICO conspiracy (count 1), failure to file CTRs (counts 2-9), filing false CTRs (counts 10-22), unlawfully structuring monetary transactions to evade filing requirements (counts 23-37), engaging in monetary transactions using property derived from illegal activities (counts 38-98), money laundering (counts 121-33), and interstate travel in aid of racketeering (counts 134-41).  Like the original indictment, the superseding indictment alleged violations of CTR requirements as predicate offenses for the RICO conspiracy and Travel Act counts, and reiterated the forfeiture allegations.  However, the superseding indictment did include several counts not directed at appellant (counts 99-120)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> There is some dispute whether alleged violations of the principle of specialty can be raised by a criminal defendant.  See, e.g., Demjanjuk, 776 F.2d at 583-84 (questioning whether the person being extradited \"has standing to assert the principle of specialty\");  Kaiser v. Rutherford, 827 F.Supp. 832, 835 (D.D.C.1993) (asserting that \"[t]he rule of specialty is not a right of the accused but is a privilege of the asylum state and therefore [the defendant] has no standing to raise this issue\") (internal quotation marks omitted).  We need not probe the matter of standing for three reasons.  First, while we take no view of the issue, we realize that there are two sides to the story, and the side that favors individual standing has much to commend it.  See, e.g., United States v. Rauscher, 119 U.S. 407, 422-24, 7 S.Ct. 234, 242-43, 30 L.Ed. 425 (1886) (referring to specialty as a \"right conferred upon persons brought from a foreign country\" via extradition proceedings);  Thirion, 813 F.2d at 151 &amp; n. 5 (to like effect);  see also United States v. Alvarez-Machain, 504 U.S. 655, 659-60, 112 S.Ct. 2188, 2191-92, 119 L.Ed.2d 441 (1992) (suggesting the continuing vitality of the Rauscher decision).  Second, the government has advised us that, for policy reasons, it does not challenge appellant's standing in this instance.  Third, appellant's asseverations are more easily dismissed on the merits.  See Norton v. Mathews, 427 U.S. 524, 532, 96 S.Ct. 2771, 2775, 49 L.Ed.2d 672 (1976) (explaining that jurisdictional questions may be bypassed when a ruling on the merits will achieve the same result)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The judge instructed the jury:</p>\n        <p>You have heard references during this trial to currency transaction reporting requirements and I should make it clear that you are not being called upon to determine whether the defendant violated or conspired to violate any of those requirements.  Therefore, you may consider evidence regarding the nature of currency transactions with banks to the extent that such evidence, in your view, may bear on the source of the money involved and/or the purposes for which the money may have been transferred or transported.  But in reaching your verdict, you may not consider whether any such transactions were or were not consistent with transaction reporting requirements because, ... as I have just said, that is not an issue in this case....</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Of course, appellant had already been extradited and the Swiss authorities had already approved the superseding indictment before this supposed promise was made.  This places a further obstacle in appellant's path:  it strikes us as problematic whether the breach of a promise made after the defendant has been extradited, without more, furnishes a basis for reversing an ensuing conviction.  In such circumstances, the surrendering state, by definition, has not relied on the requesting state's promise in deciding to return the defendant</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> If more is needed--and we do not believe that it is--the evidence of CTR violations, by and large, was independently admissible to support various aspects of the money laundering charges and other substantive counts for which extradition was explicitly approved</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Appellant does not assign error to the denial of the continuances that he sought before the first (aborted) trial.

Stevenson, 6 F.3d 1262, 1265 (7th Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We think this description heads in the right direction but goes too far.  See, e.g., United States v. Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d 480, 490 (1st Cir.1994) (reversing district court's refusal to grant a continuance on the ground that newly emergent evidence justified more time);  Delaney v.

See 996 F.2d at 1285.   In that respect, Tajeddini resembles United States v. Khan, 787 F.2d 28, 34 (2d Cir.1986) (finding defendant's claim that he lacked the wherewithal to be a major drug dealer properly rebutted by evidence about the modest price of heroin in Pakistan, the practice among Pakistani dealers of selling drugs on credit, and the tendency of all Pakistanis, regardless of wealth, to dress alike)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> The closing argument also contained the following passage:</p>\n        <p>[W]e are asking you to draw some outrageous innuendo that because people are Colombians, they are involved in cocaine.  The Government simply is not suggesting that.  What we are suggesting is based on the evidence, the cocaine comes from Colombia.  Juan Carlos Garcia testified that he was born in Colombia and Raoul Escobar testified that he was born in Colombia.  This defendant went--on two occasions he went to Colombia to discuss money-laundering with Tulio Alzate and Roberto Juri.</p>\n        <p>Although we cannot tell whether the prosecutor misspoke or whether his remarks were mistranscribed, we believe that the first sentence contains an error.

See Jones v. DEA, 819 F.Supp. 698, 720 (M.D.Tenn.1993) (citing DEA report).  This criticism is overblown.  The court permitted the witness to describe the report's conclusions and to indicate that he had relied on those findings.  See Fed.R.Evid. 703 (authorizing reliance on facts or data \"of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject\").  The court's decision to preclude attribution of the report was well within its discretion.  Moreover, because the report was available to appellant despite the government's alleged failure to disclose it in a timeous manner, the rule of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), does not profit appellant's cause.

We reject this remonstrance.  The district court did not \"amend\" its judgment, but, rather, ordered forfeiture of substitute assets based on a supportable finding that appellant had transferred forfeited proceeds beyond the jurisdiction of the court.  Contrary to appellant's intimation, this procedure did not insult his constitutional entitlement to due process, nor did it run afoul of the Double Jeopardy Clause</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> The district court imposed forfeiture pursuant to both a money laundering statute, see 18 U.S.C.

Although there are some slight differences in the operation of the two statutes, see Saccoccia, 823 F.Supp. at 1001-05, these differences do not affect our analysis of the extradition issues.  For simplicity's sake, we refer only to the RICO forfeiture statute.

The Commission has not yet decided whether the changes, if they become law, should apply retrospectively.  See 60 Fed.Reg. at 25,074.  If the amendments are eventually determined to warrant retroactive application, appellant may then be in a position to seek appropriate relief in the district court.  See United States v. Connell, 960 F.2d 191, 197 n. 10 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Miller, 903 F.2d 341, 349 (5th Cir.1990).

We find no fault with this approach.  Despite the superficial severity of a 660-year sentence, it is neither more nor less than the functional equivalent of life without parole.  We treat the sentence in this light in evaluating its correctness under the guidelines and its harshness for Eighth Amendment purposes</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> To the extent appellant's argument is based on a claimed congressional preference for concurrent sentences in connection with conspiracy and its object offenses, and in connection with general and specific offenses, the 36 consecutive ten-year sentences imposed for separate violations of 18 U.S.C.

He became enmeshed in money laundering through his involvement with a fellow metalman, Barry Slomovits.  At a point in the mid-1980s, Slomovits was accepting millions of dollars in cash each week from Duvan Arboleda, who represented a group of Colombian drug lords (the Cali cartel).  Slomovits used some of this cash to purchase gold from appellant.  By special arrangement, the transactions were accomplished without documentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, Arboleda and appellant agreed that they would deal directly with each other.  From that juncture forward, appellant used his various businesses to cleanse money funnelled to him by the Cali cartel and its emissaries (including Arboleda, Fernando Duenas, and Raoul Escobar).  Typically, Arboleda would make large quantities of cash available to appellant;  appellant would send some of it to Slomovits in New York;  Slomovits would buy gold with the funds, resell the gold, and wire the proceeds to accounts that appellant controlled.  Slomovits received apocryphal invoices from appellant's companies purporting to show sales of gold for sums corresponding to the amounts of the wire transfers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahron Sharir, a manufacturer of gold chain, also washed money for appellant.  Appellant used Sharir's New York factory as a drop-off point for incoming shipments of currency, and Sharir laundered the cash by methods similar to those employed by Slomovits.  The shipments to Sharir's factory continued until 1988.  From then on, the two men forsook the New York factory, but continued to deal with each other.  Appellant delivered cash totalling over $35,000,000 to Sharir at other locations between 1988 and 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By 1990, appellant's operations had expanded and had become largely independent of Slomovits.  Appellant would bid for opportunities to launder money on behalf of the Cali cartel.  When the cartel accepted a bid, he or his couriers would receive sacks of currency at prearranged delivery points.  These shipments ordinarily ranged between $50,000 and $500,000 (although one delivery totalled $3,000,000).  The bills were usually in small denominations.  They would be counted, transported to one of appellant's offices in California or Rhode Island, then counted again, smurfed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and used to buy cashier's checks payable to one of appellant's companies.  These purchases were made at various banks by underlings (e.g., David Izzi, Anthony DeMarco, James Saccoccio, Kenneth Saccoccio) in accordance with instructions received from appellant or his wife, Donna Saccoccia.  After the checks had been deposited in a company account, the money would then be wired to a foreign bank designated by Arboleda or Duenas.  Along the way, appellant would deduct a commission that usually approximated ten percent of the laundered cash.  This completed \"la vuelta,\" the term used by the Cali cartel to describe a complete cycle of drug smuggling activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The spring of 1991 marked the beginning of the end of appellant's career in high finance.  During the early stages of his operation, the money received in New York was transported to Rhode Island by armored car and then deposited in an account standing in the name of a controlled corporation, Trend Precious Metals (Trend), at Citizens Bank.  Between January 1, 1990 and April 2, 1991, appellant and his wife wired over $136,000,000 out of the Trend account to an assortment of foreign banks.  Citizens became suspicious and closed the account.  In approximately the same time frame, an employee of an armored car service warned Richard Gizarelli, an unindicted coconspirator, that appellant was under investigation.  Gizarelli promptly informed appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding these omens, appellant persisted.  He did, however, alter his modus operandi.   Instead of using private couriers to transport cash from New York to Rhode Island, he sent any of four men--Izzi, Carlo DeMarco, Anthony DeMarco, or Vincent Hurley, often (but not always) operating in pairs--to haul the money to Rhode Island.  And, although appellant's cohorts continued to purchase bank checks from various Rhode Island financial institutions, appellant began to send the checks to his offices in California by air courier, often in canisters labeled as containing gold (to which appellant's henchmen added slag or scrap metal to increase weight).  Accomplices used the money to purchase gold, which was then sold on the open market.  The proceeds were eventually wired back to one of appellant's remaining Rhode Island accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August of 1991, appellant convened a meeting at his mother's home.  He showed the conferees (who included Donna Saccoccia, Izzi, and the two DeMarcos) a videotape that had been discovered accidentally in a nearby building.  The tape reflected an ongoing surveillance of the back entrance to appellant's Cranston coin shop.  He advised his colleagues to start using the store's front entrance.  Soon thereafter, appellant departed for Switzerland.  In short order, the authorities indicted and extradited him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After unsuccessfully seeking to postpone prosecution on health-related grounds,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> appellant went to trial on November 4, 1992, in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, along with several other indicted coconspirators (including his wife).  Appellant's attorney became ill during trial, and the court declared a mistrial as to appellant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The new trial began on February 17, 1993, and resulted in his conviction.  These appeals followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Saccoccia's appeals were consolidated for oral argument with the appeals arising out of the first trial.  See supra note 3.  Notwithstanding the obvious differences in the trial records and in the posture of the prosecutions--for example, appellant was the leader of the money laundering organization; unlike most of the others, he was not tried for currency transaction reporting (CTR) offenses;  and he was convicted in a trial separate from that of his codefendants--appellant seeks to incorporate by reference eight arguments advanced by other defendants.  Because appellant's position is not substantially similar to that of the codefendants, and because he has failed to develop the idiosyncracies of his own situation, we deem five of those arguments to have been abandoned.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See United States v. David, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566001\"><a href=\"/opinion/566001/united-states-v-shmuel-david-united-states-of-america-v-jaime-toro/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span>, 737 (1st Cir.1991) (\"Adoption by reference, however, cannot occur in a vacuum;  to be meaningful, the arguments adopted must be readily transferrable from the proponent's case to the adopter's case.\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Appellant has served up a bouillabaisse of other offerings.  We address his meatier propositions below, including the three \"incorporated\" contentions that arguably have been preserved.  And although we do not deem detailed discussion desirable, the record should reflect that we have masticated appellant's remaining points and found them indigestible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. EXTRADITION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold matter, appellant maintains that his trial and ensuing conviction violated the extradition treaty between the United States and Switzerland, and, in the bargain, transgressed the principles of dual criminality and specialty.

On November 18, 1991, a federal grand jury returned the indictment that inaugurated this prosecution.  Count 1 charged appellant, his wife, and eleven associates with RICO conspiracy.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(d) (1988).  A RICO conspiracy, of course, requires the government to prove, inter alia, an illicit agreement to conduct a pattern of racketeering activity.  See United States v.

The grand jury also averred that the RICO conspiracy had been accomplished by means that included failing to file the necessary CTRs for cash transactions over $10,000.

They contested extradition on counts 1 through 68, and counts 143 through 150.  On June 11, 1992, the Swiss Federal Tribunal (SFT) granted extradition on all charges except those contained in counts 2 through 68.  The SFT reasoned that these 67 counts constituted nonextraditable offenses because Swiss law did not prohibit the underlying conduct.  The SFT's discussion did not specifically mention the forfeiture allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Swiss surrendered appellant to the United States.  He was transported to Rhode Island and arraigned on July 15.  One week later, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  On July 30, the Justice Department, in the person of Michael O'Hare, wrote to Tania Cavassini, a Swiss official, enclosing a copy of the superseding indictment and inquiring whether it required a waiver of the rule of specialty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 1, 1992, apparently in response to an inquiry from Cavassini, O'Hare transmitted a written assurance that, although the court papers still formally listed appellant as a defendant in respect to the CTR counts (for which extradition had been denied), the prosecution did not intend to press those counts.  O'Hare explained that the prosecutor would offer no evidence of appellant's guilt on those charges, with the result that \"American law [will require] the judge to direct the jury to find the defendant not guilty.\"   The following day, Cavassini advised that, under a \"final decision\" dated November 20, 1992, the SFT had \"granted extradition of [appellant] for the facts enclosed in the Count Nr. 1 of the Superseding Indictment.\"   Cavassini also indicated that appellant's local counsel in Geneva agreed with the SFT's decision and had scotched any possibility of a further appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 2, 1993, before the start of the trial with which we are concerned, the government moved to dismiss those counts of the superseding indictment (counts 2-37) that charged appellant with CTR offenses.  The district court complied.  The matter resurfaced in a slightly different shape ten days later when appellant's Swiss lawyer, Paul Gully-Hart, wrote to Cavassini expressing concern that appellant's impending prosecution on charges in which CTR violations were embedded as predicates for other offenses would insult the rule of specialty.  On March 2, Gully-Hart wrote again, this time enclosing a copy of the prosecution's opening statement to the petit jury.  Cavassini forwarded both of these letters to O'Hare.  On March 8, Cavassini spoke with O'Hare and voiced her concern that appellant might be convicted under count 1 solely on the basis of CTR offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, Assistant United States Attorney James Leavey, a member of the prosecution team, advised Judge Torres that he had spoken with O'Hare.  Without conceding the legal validity of Gully-Hart's point, Leavey asked the court to instruct the jury that CTR violations could not serve as predicates for purposes of either the RICO or Travel Act counts.  When the court acquiesced, the government submitted a redacted indictment that deleted all references to CTR offenses from the RICO and Travel Act counts.  Appellant nonetheless moved for a mistrial, invoking the rules of dual criminality and specialty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the motion, explaining that it had agreed to the government's proposal purely as an accommodation.  In the judge's view, the precautions were not legally required because the SFT had been pellucid in authorizing prosecution on the RICO count even though the claimed CTR violations were prominently displayed therein as potential predicates.  The judge noted, moreover, that evidence of appellant's CTR violations was in all events admissible in connection with the substantive money laundering counts (as to which extradition had been approved).  Appellant resurrected the issue in his motion for a new trial following the adverse jury verdict.  The court stood firm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>B. Dual Criminality and Specialty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the principles of dual criminality and specialty are closely allied, they are not coterminous.  We elaborate below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Dual Criminality.   The principle of dual criminality dictates that, as a general rule, an extraditable offense must be a serious crime (rather than a mere peccadillo) punishable under the criminal laws of both the surrendering and the requesting state.  See Brauch v. Raiche, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"376815\"><a href=\"/opinion/376815/ernest-wolfgang-brauch-v-robert-raiche-united-states-marshal/\"><span class=\"volume\">618</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">843</span></a></span>, 847 (1st Cir.1980).  The current extradition treaty between the United States and Switzerland embodies this concept.  See Treaty of Extradition, May 14, 1900, U.S.-Switz., Art.  II, 31 Stat. 1928, 1929-30 (Treaty).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principle of dual criminality does not demand that the laws of the surrendering and requesting states be carbon copies of one another.  Thus, dual criminality will not be defeated by differences in the instrumentalities or in the stated purposes of the two nations' laws.  See Peters v. Egnor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531289\"><a href=\"/opinion/531289/frank-edward-peters-v-jack-egnor-united-states-marshal-for-the-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span>, 719 (10th Cir.1989).  By the same token, the counterpart crimes need not have identical elements.  See Matter of Extradition of Russell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"469173\"><a href=\"/opinion/469173/in-the-matter-of-the-extradition-of-marie-louise-russell-charged-as-helen/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">801</span></a></span>, 803 (9th Cir.1986).  Instead, dual criminality is deemed to be satisfied when the two countries' laws are substantially analogous.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531289\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Peters,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/531289/frank-edward-peters-v-jack-egnor-united-states-marshal-for-the-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span>;  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"376815\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Brauch,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/376815/ernest-wolfgang-brauch-v-robert-raiche-united-states-marshal/\"><span class=\"volume\">618</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">851</span></a></span>.   Moreover, in mulling dual criminality concerns, courts are duty bound to defer to a surrendering sovereign's reasonable determination that the offense in question is extraditable.  See Casey v. Department of State, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596387\"><a href=\"/opinion/596387/lionel-james-casey-v-department-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1472</span></a></span>, 1477 (D.C.Cir.1992) (observing that an American court must give great deference to a foreign court's determination in extradition proceedings);  United States v.

If the same conduct is subject to criminal sanctions in both jurisdictions, no more is exigible.  See United States v.

IX.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enforcement of the principle of specialty is founded primarily on international comity.

The requesting state must \"live up to whatever promises it made in order to obtain extradition\" because preservation of the institution of extradition requires the continuing cooperation of the surrendering state.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span> </span>(1992).  Marching beneath this banner, appellant urges that his conviction must be set aside for three related reasons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  None has merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Predicate Acts.   Appellant's flagship contention rests on the postulate that an offense which is itself nonextraditable cannot serve as a predicate act in connection with other, extraditable offenses;  and that, therefore, the government's use of nonextraditable CTR offenses as predicate acts for purposes of the RICO and Travel Act counts crossed the line into forbidden territory.  Even if we assume, however, that in some situations reliance on nonextraditable offenses as predicates for other, extraditable offenses might run afoul of dual criminality or specialty principles, the circumstances of this case present no such problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, we do not believe that there can be a violation of the principle of specialty where the requesting nation prosecutes the returned fugitive for the exact crimes on which the surrendering nation granted extradition.  So it is here:  the SFT twice approved appellant's extradition on counts that prominently featured CTR offenses as predicates.  This approval--to which we must pay the substantial deference that is due to a surrendering court's resolution of questions pertaining to extraditability, see, e.g., Casey, 980 F.2d at 1477--strongly suggests that the RICO and Travel Act counts, despite their mention of predicates which, standing alone, would not support extradition, are compatible with the criminal laws of both jurisdictions.  Though a Swiss official may informally have fretted about the prospect of a RICO or Travel Act conviction based on nonextraditable predicates, we are reluctant to conclude on this gossamer showing that the SFT did not know and appreciate the clearly expressed contents of the indictment when it sanctioned extradition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To clinch matters, the prosecution avoided any potential intrusion on the principles of either dual criminality or specialty by taking a series of prophylactic actions at trial.  The fourth redacted indictment removed all references to CTR offenses from the compendium of charges pressed against the appellant.  The judge then reinforced this fumigation of the indictment by advising the jurors that they should not concern themselves with whether appellant had committed any CTR offenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  These precautions purged any taint, and knocked the legs out from under the line of reasoning that appellant seeks to pursue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Keeping Faith.   Next, appellant asserts that the government infringed on the principle of specialty by breaking its promise to the Swiss government and introducing evidence of CTR violations at appellant's trial.  Abstractly, we agree with the core element of appellant's premise:  the principle of specialty requires the requesting state to abide by the promises it makes to the surrendering state in the process of procuring extradition.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"466315\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Najohn,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/466315/united-states-v-david-najohn/\"><span class=\"volume\">785</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1422</span></a></span>.   But, concretely, we are unable to discern any breach of faith in this instance.  Thus, we resist the conclusion that appellant would foist upon us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To buttress the claim that the United States did not keep its word, appellant avers that O'Hare's facsimile transmission, sent on December 1, 1992, was the functional equivalent of an assurance that the prosecutor would not present any evidence to the jury regarding Saccoccia's noncompliance with CTR requirements.  Fairly read, the document--despite its iteration that the prosecutor \"would present no evidence regarding [Saccoccia's] guilt ... on the charges for which extradition was not granted\"--does not support appellant's construction.  O'Hare sent the transmittal in response to Cavassini's expression of concern that appellant might be convicted of charges for which extradition had been denied.  His reply, taken in context, see supra p. 765, amounted to no more than an assurance against that possibility.   To read a promise not to introduce any evidence relevant to CTR violations into O'Hare's statement would necessitate wresting it from its contextual moorings and unreasonably stretching its literal meaning.  We decline appellant's invitation to indulge in such phantasmagoric wordplay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The Claimed \"Prosecution.\"   Appellant's third contention is that the government violated the principle of specialty because it prosecuted him for CTR offenses.  Since the nonextraditable CTR counts, as they pertained to appellant, were dismissed before the second trial began, his claim is founded on no more than the fact that his name appeared on the indictment during the first trial.  While this may literally be \"prosecution,\" it is prosecution in name only--and we will not carry hollow formalism to a point at which it engulfs common sense.  Consequently, we hold that the mere existence of an unredacted indictment, under the circumstances of this case, is no reason to invalidate Saccoccia's conviction.  Cf. Tacket v. Delco Remy Div. of Gen. Motors Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564367\"><a href=\"/opinion/564367/thomas-j-tacket-v-delco-remy-division-of-general-motors-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1201</span></a></span>, 1202 (7th Cir.1991) (Bauer, C.J.)  (quoting doggerel to the effect that \"[s]ticks and stones may break your bones, but names can never hurt you\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves appellant's argument that he was illegally \"prosecuted\" because CTR offenses were included as predicate acts for purposes of the RICO and Travel Act counts until the fourth redacted indictment surfaced.  As we have already observed, however, it would have been perfectly proper for the government to seek convictions on those counts based on CTR predicates.  Hence, appellant's argument is without merit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we find appellant's conviction free from taint under the applicable extradition laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE COVETED CONTINUANCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that the district court arbitrarily refused him a lengthy continuance prior to the start of the second trial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> leaving him with insufficient preparation time.  Our analysis of the record indicates that the court acted within its discretion in scotching appellant's request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>A. Setting the Stage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At arraignment, two attorneys, Jack Hill and Brian Adae, entered appearances as appellant's counsel.  Soon thereafter, Austrian authorities arrested Hill for money laundering.  Hill languished in prison from August through November of 1992.  During that interval, he could not communicate with, or effectively assist, Saccoccia.  Adae, who had originally been enlisted as local counsel, stepped into the breach and acted as lead counsel.  Shortly after the first trial began, Adae became ill.  The court granted appellant's motion for a mistrial and ordered a severance.  The case proceeded to verdict vis-a-vis the other defendants.  See supra note 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Naturally, the severance required a separate trial for appellant.  The district court proposed to start in early February of 1993.  Within a matter of days after the court announced the schedule, Hill, recently released from an Austrian prison, and Kenneth O'Donnell, a prominent Rhode Island defense lawyer, entered appearances as appellant's counsel.  On December 10, 1992, appellant signed an extensive waiver of the potential conflict of interest posed by Hill's representation of him at a time when Hill himself faced charges of money laundering arising out of activities undertaken in conjunction with appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day, the court held a hearing anent the waiver.  Among other things, appellant requested that his trial be rescheduled to April of 1993 so that his defense team could have more time to prepare.  He claimed this extra time was necessary to review financial documents, study surveillance tapes, glean exculpatory evidence, and analyze inconsistencies in the statements of government witnesses.  The court granted only a two-week extension, from February 3 to February 17, noting that the original indictment had been returned in 1991 and that counsel already had enjoyed a considerable period for preparation.  Subsequent requests for continuances were also denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>B. Applicable Legal Principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial management is peculiarly within the ken of the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  That court has great latitude in managing its docket, including broad discretion to grant or withhold continuances.  Only \"an unreasoning and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay\" constitutes an abuse of that discretion.  Morris v.

Other relevant factors may include such things as the amount of time needed for effective preparation, the amount of time actually available for preparation, the amount of time previously available for preparation and how assiduously the movant used that time, the extent to which the movant has contributed to his perceived predicament, the complexity of the case, the availability of assistance from other sources, the probable utility of a continuance, the extent of inconvenience to others (such as the court, the witnesses, and the opposing party) should a continuance ensue, and the likelihood of injustice or unfair prejudice attributable to the denial of a continuance.

Analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, balancing the relevant considerations leaves us confident that the circumstances justified the refusal to grant a continuance.  And, moreover, the record belies appellant's contention that the court's obduracy unfairly prejudiced his rights by leaving him insufficient time to prepare for trial.  Appellant's most loudly bruited point is that the government produced 1600 hours of wiretap audio tapes, and that he had only 67 days, which he translates as equalling 1608 hours, to listen to them.  Although this lament has some superficial plausibility, we agree with the district court that, notwithstanding the number of tapes, it was reasonable to expect defense counsel to be ready for trial in February.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grand jury indicted appellant in November of 1991.  Thus, appellant's counsel, collectively, had far more than 67 days in which to work on the case.  Moreover, the lawyers had the not inconsiderable benefit of a dress rehearsal, including unlimited access to the full record of the first trial (in which virtually the entire case against appellant was aired).  O'Donnell, one of appellant's new attorneys, was especially familiar with the situation because he had represented a codefendant who had been acquitted in a separate trial.  Furthermore, Hill and O'Donnell could--and no doubt did--confer with counsel for the codefendants and with Attorney Adae.  In short, the means for efficacious preparation were tidily at hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's other assertions of supposed prejudice also lack force.  For example, his suggestion that a continuance might have enabled him to receive a complete transcript of Agent Shedd's conversation with Duenas overlooks the fact that the government provided him with the entire transcript.  See infra Part IV(E).  His claim that more time was needed to obtain a copy of a DEA report that he asserts would have bolstered the testimony of an expert witness overlooks the fact that the expert knew of the report and described its conclusions.  See infra note 18.  His claim that a continuance would have enabled him to obtain enhanced versions of two of the surveillance tapes before trial, see infra Part IV(F), is completely unpersuasive given his assertion that the enhanced tapes, when received, were \"unclear\" and \"unintelligible.\"   Appellant's Brief at 36.  And, finally, appellant's exhortation that a continuance would have allowed him to investigate whether the laundered cash represented gambling proceeds, as opposed to drug money, is unaccompanied by any colorable basis for assuming that his supposition was anything more than the most remote of possibilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a nutshell, appellant has not made a sufficient showing of undue prejudice to warrant us in second-guessing either the district court's resolve to start the trial in mid-February of 1993 or its decision to grant appellant a far more modest delay than he requested.  Since the record reflects no pressing need for an extended continuance, and likewise fails to demonstrate significant harm flowing from the lack of one, the denial of the motion for a continuance cannot be said to have substantially impaired appellant's defense.  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504003\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Dennis,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/504003/united-states-v-trevor-dennis/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">653</span> </a></span>n. 1.

Conflict of Interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relatedly, appellant claims that the denial of a continuance saddled him with conflict-ridden counsel.  This construct does not withstand scrutiny.  To show an actual conflict of interest, a criminal defendant \"must demonstrate that some plausible alternative defense strategy might have been pursued\" and \"that this alternative strategy was not pursued because of the attorney's other loyalties or interests.\"  United States v. Garcia-Rosa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524260\"><a href=\"/opinion/524260/united-states-v-blanca-garcia-rosa-united-states-of-america-v-pedro/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span>, 231 (1st Cir.1989), cert. granted and judgment vacated on other grounds, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112501\"><a href=\"/opinion/112501/united-states-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Appellant cannot meet this standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant sees the conflict of interest as centered in Hill's need to protect himself at his client's expense.  Appellant supports this accusation by repeated reference to Hill's indictment in Austria on charges that he conspired with appellant to launder the fruits of unlawful activity--but appellant does not suggest any way in which this alleged conflict of interest adversely affected Hill's representation of him at trial.  What is more, appellant's claim that he was faced with an intolerable dilemma--he could accept Hill as his counsel or proceed to trial with an attorney who was untutored in the case--is flatly contradicted by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant insisted, time and again, despite the district court's painstaking explanation of his right to conflict-free counsel, that Hill was the advocate of his choosing.  Appellant told the court unequivocally that he understood the potential conflict, but desired Hill's services.  And he adhered to his position notwithstanding the court's entreaty to reconsider and its advice that he would be \"better off\" with an attorney free of any ties to the situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last--but surely not least--appellant executed a written waiver stating that, after \"[h]aving been fully advised of the possible adverse consequences arising from the actual or potential conflicts with which Hill is or may be encumbered,\" he \"knowingly, voluntarily, intelligently, and irrevocably [wishes] to waive any and all such actual or potential conflicts of interest for the purpose of retaining Hill as his counsel.\"   When a defendant knowingly selects a course of action, fully cognizant of its perils, he cannot later repudiate it simply because his case curdles.  In the circumstances at bar, it is neither unfair nor unjust to hold appellant to his words.  Thus, the district court's determination that appellant had voluntarily and knowingly waived his right to conflict-free representation is unimpugnable.  See Holloway v. Arkansas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109825\"><a href=\"/opinion/109825/holloway-v-arkansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span>, 483 n. 5, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109825\"><a href=\"/opinion/109825/holloway-v-arkansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He reasons that the court should have overlooked his waiver of conflict-free counsel because Hill's continued representation constituted an unwaivable constitutional transgression.  To be sure, a few courts have found a per se Sixth Amendment violation \"where trial counsel was implicated in the crime for which his client was on trial.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664046\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Soldevila-Lopez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/664046/united-states-v-angel-a-soldevila-lopez-aka-angelo/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">487</span> </a></span>n. 4 (citing cases).  But these cases tend to involve circumstances in which an attorney has reason to fear that a vigorous defense of the client might unearth proof of the attorney's criminality.  See, e.g., United States v. Cancilla, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"430505\"><a href=\"/opinion/430505/united-states-v-peter-cancilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">725</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></a></span>, 870 (2d Cir.1984).  Although Hill informed the court, in the vaguest of generalities, that he feared being charged or called as a witness in appellant's case, he provided no substantiation of these assertions, nor was he able to explain how the hypothetical conflict would, at that time, affect his representation of the appellant.  Therefore, the district court seems entirely justified in concluding that Hill's representation of appellant would not be hampered by a realistic foreboding that vigorous advocacy would uncover evidence of his own crimes.  Cf. William Shakespeare, Macbeth, Act I, sc. iii, ll. 133-34 (1605) (noting that \"present fears are less than horrible imaginings\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sockdolager is that, wholly apart from Hill's status, appellant was also represented at trial by another lawyer, O'Donnell, who had no conflict of interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  In an effort to scale this rampart, appellant suggests that O'Donnell, too, had an actual conflict of interest arising out of his previous representation of a codefendant, Raymond Marotto.  By December of 1992, however, Marotto, a bank employee charged with failing to file CTRs, had been acquitted in a separate trial.  Appellant's convoluted explanation of how O'Donnell's concluded representation of Marotto created a conflict of interest is difficult to follow.  He seems to be saying, without any citation to the record, that Marotto (who was not called to testify at appellant's trial) could have been a material witness.  We reject this unfounded speculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As O'Donnell himself pointed out, Marotto's case turned on whether he did--or did not--have a responsibility to file CTRs.  There is nothing in the record that suggests that Marotto had any knowledge that might have been useful in appellant's defense.  We have routinely dismissed analogous conflict of interest claims, see, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524260\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Garcia-Rosa,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/524260/united-states-v-blanca-garcia-rosa-united-states-of-america-v-pedro/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">231</span> </a></span>(so holding when defendant \"provide[d] no substantiation\" for his assertion that his counsel had a conflict of interest that manifested itself when he did not call as a witness a person whom he previously had represented), and we dismiss appellant's claim on the same basis.

The proffer suggested a global conspiracy \"between the Israeli intelligence services and the CIA,\" and asserted that he had witnesses who \"would testify about such matters as the Israeli defense industry\" and \"[t]he method by which the building of Israeli religious schools is financed by Hasidic Jews in the United States who engage in money laundering.\"   Appellant claimed that his counsel needed time to investigate the matters described in the proffer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found the proffer to be \"too vague and unsubstantiated to constitute a basis for granting a continuance\" because its \"conclusory allegations\" offered no explanation as to its relevancy to the case.  Moreover, the court found no evidence that diligent efforts had been made to assure availability of the testimony and documents in a proper time frame.  Hence, the court determined that the proffer afforded an inadequate basis for the requested continuance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no abuse of discretion.

Appellant's argument focuses on evidence adduced, or remarks made, at four different points during his trial.  First, appellant accuses the government of eliciting testimony concerning the birthplaces of Escobar and Garcia (both of whom were born in Colombia), while not inquiring about any other individual's place of birth.  Second, the court permitted Sharir to testify that appellant told him to be careful because he was dealing with Colombians, who would go after his family if they were crossed.  Third, when Donald Semesky, an IRS agent, offered expert testimony as to the modus operandi of Colombian drug cartels, he mentioned, among other things, that two Colombian cartels control the illegal importation of cocaine into the United States, and that their narcotics trafficking generates much cash, necessitating money laundering.

In the case at bar, all the evidence about Colombia, viewed in context, was properly admitted and used.  By like token, the prosecutor's comments were not beyond the pale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's first contention is factually incorrect.  The prosecutor asked several witnesses other than Escobar and Garcia (e.g., Sharir and Slomovits) where they were born.  Seen in this light, the casual questioning about place of birth, not objected to at trial, cannot conceivably plunge to the plane of plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Sharir's testimony that Saccoccia told him to be wary because he was dealing with Colombians is highly probative on the issue of appellant's knowledge that the laundered funds were derived from illegal activities.  Moreover, common sense suggests that drug traffickers are more likely than, say, Avon ladies, to harm the families of business associates if a deal sours.  It is, therefore, a gross exaggeration to declare that the evidence had no purpose other than to suggest that Colombians are prone to violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Agent Semesky's testimony was relevant and appropriate in several respects.  First, it went a long way toward explaining the nature of money laundering and the basis for appellant's activities.  This is a perfectly legitimate use of evidence.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541729\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Doe,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/541729/united-states-v-john-doe-aka-louw-s-smith-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">19</span> </a></span>&amp; n. 21 (citing cases).  Even the testimony about the cartels' control over the American drug trade was relevant on the issue of whether the cash that appellant scrubbed clean was in fact derived from illegal activities.  The evidence could support a jury's plausible, though circumstantial, inference of an illicit source of funds based on appellant's repeated wire transfers of millions of dollars in laundered money to a country that functions as the nerve center of the world's traffic in cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only remotely problematic references to Colombia are those contained in the summation.  For example, a prosecutor stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p>[Agent Semesky] told you as an expert, something you probably already knew, that cocaine comes from Colombia.  That it's run by cartels in Colombia.  That they ship the money up here and it gets out into the streets.  That's the reason for all these ten and twenty dollar bills.  These are grams of coke....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later on, after reminding the jurors that the case involved roughly $100,000,000 \"generated on the streets of New York that is sent back to Colombia,\" a prosecutor posed a series of rhetorical questions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p>If we're not talking about cocaine, what are we talking about?   Is this from coffee vendors?   Is this money coming from people out in the streets selling Colombian coffee?   Oh, I have had a good day today.  Five hundred thousand dollars, unfortunately, it's all in twenty dollar bills.  Think of the change they had to give.  This is a case about Roberto Juri and Tulio Alzate and Fernando Duenas and Stephen Saccoccia, not Juan Valdez, ladies and gentlemen.  The evidence in this case and the only reasonable inference you can draw is drug money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant did not interject a contemporaneous objection to any of these comments.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It strains credulity to suggest, as Saccoccia does, that the prosecution was arguing that only drugs and coffee come from Colombia.  The remark about coffee vendors was obviously intended to show the unlikelihood that any legitimate business would generate the volume of cash that flowed through appellant's operation.  The quip about Juan Valdez,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> while an unnecessary aside, cannot be said to emphasize emotion over facts.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541729\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Doe,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/541729/united-states-v-john-doe-aka-louw-s-smith-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>.   Viewed as a whole, the prosecution's evidence and comments about Colombia provide no basis for disturbing the jury's verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before ending our elaboration we note, as an adscript, that appellant himself is not Colombian, but is of Italian ancestry.  This mitigates one of the most serious dangers of evidence about a person's national origin:  that the jury will believe the defendant is guilty because of stereotyping.  Appellant has not cited any case in which a court has reversed a conviction due to evidence touching upon a national origin not shared by the defendant.  This is not to say that injustice and unfair prejudice may never result from a conviction based on improper use of evidence about the national origin of a defendant's friends or business associates.  But, the ricochet effect of such evidence is likely to do less harm, on average, than the direct impact of evidence about the defendant's country of origin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p>C.

At trial Bosco's handler, Sgt. Edward Conley, testified that he took Bosco to a bank in Cranston, Rhode Island on March 23, 1990.  Bosco \"searched\" several areas of the bank, such as the vault and teller stations, and did not react.  Conley then took Bosco to a room in which a bag containing $9,000 was located, and, when he instructed Bosco to search for drugs, the dog \"showed a strong, positive aggressive alert, shaking the bag, ripping it apart, grabbing the money in his mouth, and ripping the money.\"   According to Conley, a similar search, with similar results, took place on April 20, 1990, at a different bank in Johnston, Rhode Island.  In each instance, the currency to which Bosco reacted had been brought to the bank by appellant's associates in order to purchase cashier's checks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To meet this testimony, appellant called two experts who attacked the reliability of Bosco's response.  One of these witnesses, Thomas Knott, testified that the manner in which Conley orchestrated the sniff tests did not properly control against the possibility of a false alert.  The second expert, Dr. James Woodford, criticized the testing protocol because the sniff tests were not verified by chemical field tests.  Woodford also testified as to the widespread contamination of United States currency with illegal drugs and the tenuous nature of the link between a canine alert and a conclusion that particular currency derived from narcotics trafficking (\"[I]f there were drugs on that money, it doesn't mean that it is drug money.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant insists that the probative value of the dog sniff evidence is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect, and that the district court erred in refusing to exclude the evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 403.  This claim deserves serious attention, for recent decisions about the evidentiary value of a trained dog's alert to currency are not uniform.  Compare, e.g., United States v.

We do not think that the district court, based on the information of record in this case, abused its discretion in admitting the canine sniff evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though widespread contamination of currency plainly lessens the impact of dog sniff evidence, a trained dog's alert still retains some probative value.  Ordinary experience suggests that currency used to purchase narcotics is more likely than other currency to have come into contact with drugs.  Here, moreover, the evidence supports an inference that Bosco's frenzied reaction was caused by more than a mere trace of contamination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record contains corroboration of Bosco's olfactory evidence.  Several witnesses testified that ordinary human senses could detect something unusual about the money that appellant's associates brought to the banks.  One teller testified that he occasionally noticed that the money felt \"dusty ... almost floury from pizza dough, that type of feeling.\"   Another teller reported that she noticed an odor or fragrance, akin to that of an orchid.  This evidence, along with Conley's testimony that the dog did not react in other areas of the banks, buttressed the lower court's belief that the dog sniff evidence had probative force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely, though the dog sniff evidence likely bolstered the prosecution's case and served to inculpate the defendant, we are not convinced that it presented a substantial risk of unfair prejudice.  See generally <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524961\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rodriguez-Estrada,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/524961/united-states-v-hector-m-rodriguez-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">156</span> </a></span>(\"By design, all evidence is meant to be prejudicial;  it is only unfair prejudice which must be avoided.\").  After all, the court allowed appellant to call two expert witnesses who debunked Bosco's reaction to the currency.  If, on one hand, the jury believed the experts, it doubtless discounted the value of the canine alert.  If, on the other hand, the jury disbelieved appellant's experts, it was entitled to place a greater value on the canine sniff.  See, e.g., Quinones-Pacheco v. American Airlines, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"594418\"><a href=\"/opinion/594418/valentin-quinones-pacheco-v-american-airlines-inc-valentin/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that \"expert opinion testimony, even if not directly contradicted, is not ordinarily binding on a jury\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, considering the high degree of deference we owe to a district court's balancing of probative value against unfairly prejudicial effects, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524961\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rodriguez-Estrada,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/524961/united-states-v-hector-m-rodriguez-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span>, we cannot say that the trial court abused its wide discretion in admitting the evidence of Bosco's reaction to the currency delivered by appellant's associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p>D. Testimony of Juan Carlos Garcia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Juan Carlos Garcia, a participant in the money laundering activities, testified for the government at appellant's trial.  Garcia said that in 1987, while living in the United States, he began working for his brother-in-law, Fernando Duenas.  Following Duenas' orders, Garcia would respond when paged on his beeper, arrange to retrieve a quantity of cash, and deposit the money in one of several bank accounts maintained under the names of Duenas, Duenas' wife (Garcia's sister), or Duenas' brother.  By the end of 1987 the cash had mushroomed from $10,000-$20,000 per shipment to $150,000-$200,000 per shipment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garcia met appellant for the first time in May 1989.  With Duenas' blessing, the two men agreed that appellant would accept bundles of cash from Garcia and send the money to Colombia.  On countless occasions thereafter, appellant received money from Garcia and redirected it to accounts controlled by Duenas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the district court permitted Garcia, over objection, to testify that, in 1988, Duenas told him that a man named \"Caesar\" would call and give him something other than money.  Garcia knew Caesar because Caesar had brought money to him on a previous occasion.  Caesar called and informed Garcia that he would be delivering a kilogram of cocaine.  Subsequently, Caesar handed Garcia a shopping bag containing a block of a granular substance, beige in color.  Garcia tried to sell the merchandise, as directed by Duenas, but he was unable to do so.  He eventually delivered the package to another individual on Duenas' instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant assigns error to the trial court's admission of the testimony anent the package.  The assignment of error has twin foci:  (1) the conversations between Duenas and Garcia, and (2) Caesar's assurance that the package contained cocaine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  We believe that the court lawfully admitted the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Evidence Rules provide that \"a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy\" is not considered hearsay.  Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).  Here, the first prong of the rule is satisfied.  The record contains adequate evidence that Duenas, Garcia, and Caesar were involved in a single conspiracy to launder money.  By joining that conspiracy at a later date, appellant effectively adopted coconspirator declarations previously made.  See United States v. Murphy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508988\"><a href=\"/opinion/508988/united-states-v-noel-murphy-aka-noel-omurchu-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">852</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1988), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1022</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

When a party knowingly steps aboard, he is part of the crew, and assumes conspirator's responsibility for the existing freight--or conduct--regardless of whether he is aware of just what it is composed.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second prong of the rule is also satisfied;  the statements were made during and in furtherance of the very conspiracy that appellant joined.  For one thing, we have held that \"when a number of people combine efforts to manufacture, distribute and retail narcotics, there is a single conspiracy, a 'chain conspiracy,' despite the fact that some of the individuals linking the conspiracy together have not been in direct contact with others in the chain.\"  United States v. Rivera-Santiago, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521900\"><a href=\"/opinion/521900/united-states-v-antonio-rivera-santiago-aka-junior-vivique-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1073</span></a></span>, 1080 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span> </span>(1989).  For another thing, money laundering and narcotics trafficking are symbiotic activities, each of which may require the other in order to continue.  Duenas' efforts to have Garcia sell the cocaine for him and the group's ongoing campaign to launder money can rationally be seen as adjacent links in the lengthy chain that binds up the narcotics trafficking cycle.  Thus, the district court acted within its proper province in deeming both activities part of the same conspiracy, and in holding that the attempted narcotics sale was in furtherance of it.  Consequently, the challenged statements were properly admitted under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, moreover, as did the district court, that a statement made by an unavailable declarant<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> falls outside the hearsay exclusion if the statement \"at the time of its making ... so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability ... that a reasonable person in the declarant's position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3).  Duenas' and Caesar's statements to Garcia were tantamount to admissions that they were dealing cocaine.  Because such statements were against the declarants' penal interest, they came within the encincture of Rule 804(b)(3) and were admissible on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant's suggestion that the admission of Garcia's testimony abridged the Confrontation Clause is off base.  It is well settled that a statement falling within a firmly rooted hearsay exception will not be held to violate the Confrontation Clause.  See Ohio v. Roberts, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110324\"><a href=\"/opinion/110324/ohio-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 66, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110324\"><a href=\"/opinion/110324/ohio-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Testimony of Agent Shedd.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the late 1980s, the DEA set up a network of sham corporations ostensibly to provide a money laundering service to underworld elements.  DEA Special Agent James Shedd participated in this reverse sting operation (dubbed \"Operation Pisces\").  Duenas dealt with the Pisces network in 1987 and 1988.  At trial, a prosecutor suggested that Shedd would testify as follows:  \"Mr. Duenas told him that ninety-nine percent of the money that he was turning over to the undercover agent was, in fact, drug money.\"   On the basis of this representation, the lower court denied a motion in limine by which the defense sought to exclude Shedd's testimony regarding Duenas' statements.  Shedd told the jury about thirty-seven transactions in which Duenas supplied cash that the DEA undercover operation laundered for him.  Shedd also described several conversations with Duenas in which Duenas reportedly said that he laundered money for Colombian drug traffickers and \"that ninety-nine percent of the money that money-launderers deal in Bogota comes from narcotics proceeds.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During cross-examination, appellant's counsel challenged Shedd about this statement.  Shedd and Duenas conversed in Spanish, and some of their conversations had been recorded.  Defense counsel called Shedd's attention to one such conversation. The translation indicated that Duenas made the contested comment during a discussion in which he explained that, although it was against the law, foreign currency routinely circulated in Colombia.  He apparently added:  \"Logically, the [foreign] currency that circulates the most over there ... is the dollar ... which ninety-nine percent of it comes from drug dealing.\"   Shedd responded that his direct testimony had been premised not on a single discussion, but on an overall impression gained from a lengthy conversation with Duenas.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  Appellant then moved to strike Shedd's testimony.  Judge Torres denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant maintains that the district court made no fewer than four errors in connection with this testimony.  First, appellant posits that Duenas' statements were barred by the hearsay rule.  This claim fails.  The court was warranted in finding that these were coconspirator declarations and, thus, admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Sepulveda,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1180</span></a></span>;  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584511\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ortiz,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/584511/united-states-v-ruben-ortiz-aka-ruben-ortiz-de-jesus-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">714-15</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's second contention is that Duenas' statement, in its true form, was irrelevant because it was nothing more than a gross generalization about the Colombian economy.  We disagree.  Though courts are sometimes cautious about admitting abstract data as proof of what actually happened in an individual case, a percentage like \"ninety-nine percent\" is quite powerful, and far surpasses the usual test that evidence is relevant if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 401.

Duenas' remark, even in the diluted form that was heralded on cross-examination, has at least some probative value in ascertaining whether the drug trade was the source of the funds that appellant washed, much as the fact that a lake is contaminated has some probative value in ascertaining whether a stream that feeds the lake is contaminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's third sally alleges error in Shedd's explanation that his initial testimony about Duenas' statement was based on an overall impression from several hours of conversation.  Although a witness is generally not permitted to testify about his subjective interpretations of what has been said by another person, he may do so if his opinion is rationally based on his perception and is helpful either to an understanding of his testimony or to the determination of a fact in issue.  See United States v.

The answer was not followed by a timely objection or motion to strike.  While appellant challenged Shedd's qualifications to offer an opinion about Duenas' state of mind in a subsequent motion to strike, this was too late.  See United States v. Moore, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554888\"><a href=\"/opinion/554888/united-states-v-iona-m-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span>, 915 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that Evidence Rule 103 requires that objections be made at the time evidence is offered);  United States v.

The proper time to have registered an objection to Shedd's explanation was immediately after it was uttered.  Accordingly, any objection to the explanation has been waived.  And, moreover, even if the court erred in permitting the answer to stand, it looms as harmless beyond all doubt in the context of a very efficacious cross-examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's final contention is that the prosecution knowingly offered Shedd's testimony despite having a transcript that refuted it, and, to make a bad situation worse, deliberately withheld the transcript from the defense.  Having carefully examined the record, we find no valid reason to conclude that the prosecution intentionally mischaracterized Shedd's proposed testimony during the in limine hearing, and no hint of prosecutorial misconduct in the handling of the transcript.  At any rate, it is perfectly clear that defense counsel obtained the unexpurgated transcript in ample time to conduct a very effective cross-examination on the following day.  There was no prejudice and, hence, no reversible error.

The tapes are not entirely audible, and the parties disagree about what was said during two potentially significant conversations.  The government asserts that, in a discussion that took place at Trend's offices, Kenneth Saccoccio referred to cash that he and Hurley were counting as \"fuckin' drug money.\"   Appellant claims that this portion of the tape was inaudible.  The other conversation took place at Saccoccia Coin Company.  In it, Stanley Cirella spoke to Stephen Pizzo about an ongoing investigation of appellant's organization.  According to the government, Cirella declared that \"he\"--a pronoun that we take in context to refer to Saccoccia--had told him that \"they [the authorities] ain't doin' this [conducting the investigation] because of the coke, they're doin' this because of the washing of money.\"   Appellant contends that Cirella said \"gold\" rather than \"coke.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue on appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion in allowing the taped conversations to be presented to the jury in conjunction with the government's transcript.  In appellant's view, the inaudible portions of the tapes are so critical as to make the rest more misleading than helpful.  See United States v. Carbone, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474549\"><a href=\"/opinion/474549/united-states-v-luis-carbone-aka-luiggi/\"><span class=\"volume\">798</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.1986).

This position hinges on the premise that, in the absence of a concinnous foundation showing the speakers' knowledge, the comments cannot constitute proof vis-a-vis Stephen Saccoccia (who did not participate in the discourse) as to whether the money in fact emanated from drug transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with appellant's premise for two reasons.  First, Evidence Rule 104(b) provides that \"[w]hen the relevancy of evidence depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court shall admit it upon, or subject to, the introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding of the fulfillment of the condition.\"   In addressing foundational issues, the trial judge acts as a gatekeeper, examining the evidence and deciding \"whether the jury could reasonably find the conditional fact ... by a preponderance of the evidence.\"  Huddleston v.

We do take special note, however, that appellant's money-washing operation matched Agent Semesky's description of how Colombian drug rings traditionally laundered ill-gotten gains, and that, as the district court observed, it is difficult to conceive of any non-narcotics-related business that could create a comparable cascade of creased currency.  That the waves of cold cash typically appeared in well-worn bills of small denomination makes the tie tighter.  Then, too, the jury heard competent evidence that Duenas, who furnished money for appellant to launder, himself performed monetary ablutions for narcotics traffickers (and, on one occasion, supplied cocaine for an associate to sell).  The canine alert to currency that appellant's associates had gathered furnished some added support for the theory that the money emanated from drug sales.  Finally, appellant's own employees suggested on two occasions that the washed funds were linked to narcotics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken in the ensemble, these pieces of evidence provide an adequate foundation on which the jury could build a finding that appellant laundered drug money.

He also suggests that the principle of dual criminality prohibits the forfeiture because Swiss law does not render a defendant criminally liable for forfeiture by reason of unlawful money transfers.

The device is born out of the mating of two historically distinct traditions.  One parent is civil forfeiture, an in rem proceeding rooted in the notion that property used in, or intimately associated with, criminal activity acquires a taint, and that such property is therefore forfeitable even if not owned by the miscreant.  See United States v. Sandini, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"487135\"><a href=\"/opinion/487135/the-united-states-v-hilmer-burdette-sandini-ernest-g-rockwell-george/\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></a></span>, 872 (3d Cir.1987).  The second parent is old-hat criminal forfeiture, which traditionally operated as an incident of a felony conviction in personam against a convicted defendant, requiring him to forfeit his property to the crown.  See United States v. Nichols, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503093\"><a href=\"/opinion/503093/united-states-v-scott-l-nichols-ronald-w-bouck-also-known-as-little/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1485</span></a></span>, 1486 (10th Cir.1988).

Withal, there remains some nagging doubt about whether forfeiture is strictly a punishment as opposed to a separate substantive charge.  See, e.g., Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chtd. v.

Thus, we hold that, for purposes of extradition law, forfeiture is neither a free-standing criminal offense nor an element of a racketeering offense under RICO, but is simply an incremental punishment for that proscribed conduct.  Consequently, a defendant may be subjected to a forfeiture order even if extradition was not specifically granted in respect to the forfeiture allegations.  We base this ruling primarily on three pillars:  the weight of authority counsels in this direction;  the punitive aspects of criminal forfeiture predominate (among other things, RICO forfeiture retains the functional traits of a punishment since it is definitively imposed only after the defendant's guilt has otherwise been determined);  and, finally, treating criminal forfeiture as a punishment in the extradition milieu is consistent with the emphasis that the doctrine of dual criminality places on the unlawfulness of the defendant's conduct, and, correspondingly, on the lack of any requirement that a crime have identical elements or penalties in the two jurisdictions, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100014\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Collins,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/100014/collins-v-loisel/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span>, 42 S.Ct. at 470-71;  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543026\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Levy,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/543026/united-states-v-lawrence-louis-levy/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows, therefore, that appellant was properly subjected to a criminal forfeiture order even if he was not extradited on forfeiture charges and even if Swiss law does not provide for criminal forfeiture under comparable circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p>B. Procedural Aspects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also declaims that the procedure employed with regard to the forfeiture order deprived him of four intertwined rights:  the right to present a closing argument, the right to be present to assist counsel during the closing argument, the right to entry of a verdict of forfeiture, and the right to be present for entry of a verdict.  This quadrant of complaints is unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first two grievances are not supported by the record.  Even though appellant was absent on March 26, the court offered his counsel the opportunity to make further arguments at the disposition hearing (at which appellant was in attendance).  Affording appellant this opportunity satisfied his right to make a closing statement and his right personally to assist counsel.  The fact that appellant chose not to avail himself of the afforded opportunity is beside the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's next contention arises out of the idea that the court violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(b) and 31(e) by ordering forfeiture without entering a special verdict.  Because appellant did not object to the district court's decision to make an oral forfeiture order followed by a written decision, however, our review is limited to a hunt for plain error.  See United States v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 972-73 (1st Cir.1995);  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488020\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Griffin,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/488020/united-states-v-barry-j-griffin/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Rule 31(e) requires that a special verdict be returned when the indictment or information contains a forfeiture allegation.  But, Rule 31(a) makes it transpicuously clear that this requirement is geared to jury trials.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 31(a) (stating that the verdict \"shall be returned by the jury to the judge in open court\").  When the judge is the factfinder, the procedure for making factual determinations is governed by Fed.R.Crim.P. 23(c).  That rule provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p>In a case tried without a jury the court shall make a general finding and shall in addition, on request made before the general finding, find the facts specially.  Such findings may be oral.

In our opinion, this procedure did not constitute plain error.  See, e.g., Gibbs v. Buck, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103195\"><a href=\"/opinion/103195/gibbs-v-buck/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 78, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103195\"><a href=\"/opinion/103195/gibbs-v-buck/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He does not dwell on this thesis, instead electing to incorporate the codefendants' argument to this effect.  We, too, prefer not to linger.  The district court treated this contention at length, and we find ourselves in substantial agreement with the reasoning explicated in that court's opinion.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Saccoccia,</span> <span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

SENTENCING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without objection, the district court predicated its sentencing calculations on the November 1, 1992 edition of the federal sentencing guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>  See United States v. Harotunian, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552769\"><a href=\"/opinion/552769/united-states-v-dennis-harotunian/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span>, 1041-42 (1st Cir.1990) (\"Barring any ex post facto problem, a defendant is to be punished according to the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing.\").  The court compiled appellant's criminal history score and placed him in category II.  Turning to the other side of the grid, the court started with the money laundering guideline.  Since appellant had been convicted under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956(a)(2)(A), he had a base offense level (BOL) of 23.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2S1.1(a)(1).  The court then added 13 levels because the value of the laundered funds exceeded $100,000,000, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552769\"><a href=\"/opinion/552769/united-states-v-dennis-harotunian/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Sec. 2S1.1(b)(2)(N), </a></span>and three levels premised on a finding that appellant knew (or believed) that the funds were derived from narcotics sales, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552769\"><a href=\"/opinion/552769/united-states-v-dennis-harotunian/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Sec. 2S1.1(b)(1). </a></span> Finding appellant to be the organizer and leader of the money laundering enterprise, the court escalated four levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(a).  Finally, citing appellant's unsuccessful attempt to use his medical history as a device for extracting a continuance, see supra note 2, and stressing that the feigned illness occurred shortly after the court had denied appellant's request for postponement of the trial on other grounds, Judge Torres went up two levels for obstructing justice.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1.  These calculations yielded an adjusted offense level of 45 for the money laundering counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then turned to the RICO conspiracy count.  Inasmuch as the applicable guideline, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Sec. 2E1.1, </span>prescribes the use of an offense level equal to the greater of 19 or the adjusted offense level for the underlying conduct (here, money laundering), appellant's adjusted offense level remained unchanged.  The court took a similar look at the Travel Act counts with a similar result (the applicable guideline, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2E1.2, directs the use of an offense level equal to the greater of 6 or the adjusted offense level for the underlying conduct).  At the bottom line, then, the counts of conviction produced a total offense level (TOL) of 45.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Secs. 3D1.2(d), </span>3D1.3(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A TOL of 43 or higher requires the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment regardless of the offender's criminal history category.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>  See U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A (Sentencing Table).  However, the offenses of conviction in this case all carry maximum sentences less than life.  When, as in this instance, the maximum sentence for each offense of conviction is lower than the minimum punishment mandated by the applicable GSR, the guidelines require imposition of consecutive sentences \"to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment.\"   <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Sec. 5G1.2(d). </span> Applying this principle, the district court concluded that sentences on the several counts of conviction should run consecutively to the extent necessary to effectuate a life sentence.  Because the sentencing guidelines prescribe life in prison for persons who, like appellant, sport a TOL of 43 or higher, whereas all the counts of convictions have statutory maxima that are expressed in terms of a finite number of years, the court imposed the longest possible sentence on each count and ran the sentences consecutive to one another.  The result:  an incarcerative sentence of 660 years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant assails this sentence on manifold grounds.  His principal lines of attack are that mandatory life sentences under the guidelines are illegal;  that the district court misconceived its authority in imposing sentence;  that the court violated the Ex Post Facto Clause;  and that the court erred in making an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p>A. The Mandatory Life Sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that the imposition of a mandatory life sentence is illegal both because Congress disavowed consecutive sentences and because, in all events, a life sentence in the circumstances of this case insults the Eighth Amendment's proscription against cruel and unusual punishment.  Neither of these contentions is convincing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Congressional Intent.   It is apodictic that the sentencing guidelines cannot sweep more broadly than Congress' grant of power to the Sentencing Commission permits.  See United States v. Cooper, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582569\"><a href=\"/opinion/582569/united-states-v-clyde-m-cooper-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span>, 342 (4th Cir.1992).  Thus, if a guideline conflicts with a statute, the latter prevails.  See Stinson v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112854\"><a href=\"/opinion/112854/stinson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Fiore, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597517\"><a href=\"/opinion/597517/united-states-v-anthony-fiore/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span> </span>(1993).  Appellant perceives such a collision here.  In his view, Congress mandated a strong statutory preference for concurrent sentences, and the Sentencing Commission's instruction that fixed-year sentences should be imposed consecutively to effectuate life imprisonment, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.2(d), must yield the right of way to Congress' expressed preference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant hinges this conclusion on Congress' enactment of two statutory provisions, namely, 28 U.S.C. Secs. 994(l)(2) &amp; 994(v) (1988).  We think he reads the cited statutes with much too sanguine an eye.  Neither statute prohibits the imposition of consecutive sentences.  Rather, section 994(l )(2) merely declares the \"general inappropriateness\" of consecutive sentences for a conspiracy and its object offense, and section 994(v) merely directs the Commission to \"limit[ ] consecutive terms of imprisonment\" for convictions on related general and specific offenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a>  While these statutes arguably imply a general congressional preference for concurrent sentences, they do not, as appellant intimates, outlaw consecutive sentences.  On the contrary, the statutory scheme leaves ample room for courts, following the lead of the Sentencing Commission, to deploy consecutive sentences in appropriate circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two observations show the virtual inevitability of this conclusion.  In the first place, U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.2 became effective only with the consent of Congress.  We consider this to be powerful evidence that Congress itself saw no inconsistency between the guideline provision and the statutory scheme.  See United States v. Lueddeke, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544685\"><a href=\"/opinion/544685/united-states-v-david-lueddeke/\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 233 (7th Cir.1990).  In the second place, Congress minced no words in ceding the Commission discretion to determine what particular circumstances would trigger the need for consecutive sentences.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3584(a) (1988) (providing in part that \"if multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant at the same time ... the terms may run concurrently or consecutively\");  see also United States v. Flowers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608835\"><a href=\"/opinion/608835/united-states-v-john-g-flowers/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 316-17 (1st Cir.1993) (holding that section 3584(a) authorizes the Sentencing Commission \"to write guidelines that say when, and to what extent, [incarcerative] terms should be concurrent or consecutive\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not flog a dead horse.  Because Congress gave the Sentencing Commission expansive authority to promulgate guidelines specifying when sentences should be consecutive or concurrent, and then directed sentencing courts to refer to the guidelines in order to determine whether \"multiple sentences to terms of imprisonment should be ordered to run concurrently or consecutively,\" 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(a)(1)(D), the court below possessed the power--indeed, the responsibility--to impose a series of consecutive sentences effectuating the clearly expressed command of U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Eighth Amendment.   Appellant bemoans his sentence as mocking the Eighth Amendment's proscription against cruel and unusual punishments.  This ululation is more cry than wool.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Solem v.

There, the Court considered the application of the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole imposed in a narcotics case against a defendant who possessed more than 650 grams of cocaine.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112646\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Harmelin,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112646/harmelin-v-michigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">961</span></a></span>, 111 S.Ct. at 2684.   Justice Scalia, in an opinion joined on this point by the Chief Justice, rejected the extended proportionality analysis developed in Solem and declared that nothing in the Eighth Amendment guarantees proportionate sentences.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 965, </span>111 S.Ct. at 2686.   He concluded that \"Solem was simply wrong,\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> because the </span>Eighth Amendment provided protection with respect to modes and methods of punishment, not the length of incarceration, see <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 966-67, </span>111 S.Ct. at 2686-87.   Justice Kennedy, joined by Justices O'Connor and Souter, wrote a concurring opinion that, when combined with Justice Scalia's opinion, aggregated the five votes necessary to uphold Harmelin's sentence.  Justice Kennedy thought that stare decisis counseled adherence to a \"narrow proportionality principle,\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 996, </span>111 S.Ct. at 2702, one that recognizes that the \"Eighth Amendment does not require strict proportionality between crime and sentence.  Rather, it forbids only extreme sentences that are 'grossly disproportionate' to the crime,\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1001, </span>111 S.Ct. at 2705 (quoting Solem ).   After noting the grave harm to society wreaked by illegal drugs, Justice Kennedy found nothing \"grossly disproportionate\" in either the length nor the mandatory nature of Harmelin's sentence.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1001-08, </span>111 S.Ct. at 2705-09.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A dispassionate application of Harmelin to this case defeats appellant's attack on the constitutionality of his sentence.  Although the Justices in Harmelin disagreed on the status of proportionality review under the Eighth Amendment, a majority found insufficient disproportionality to forestall a mandatory sentence of life without parole for possession of over 650 grams of cocaine.  With this as a reference point, appellant's sentence can hardly be deemed \"grossly disproportionate\" to the underlying conduct--conduct which, by all accounts, significantly facilitated narcotics trafficking on a Brobdingnagian scale.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more would be supererogatory.  We know that Harmelin is not an aberration;  in Hutto, another case that teaches much the same lesson, the Court upheld, against a proportionality attack, a sentence of 40 years in prison for possessing nine ounces of marijuana with the intent to distribute <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110594\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">it.</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/110594/hutto-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span>, 102 S.Ct. at 705-06.   We also know that Congress--not the judiciary--is vested with the authority to define, and attempt to solve, the societal problems created by drug trafficking across national and state borders.  The Supreme Court has made it plain that the use of severe penalties as part of the legislative armamentarium does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.

The court acknowledged that it possessed such authority, but it concluded (appropriately, we think) that because the guidelines required consecutive sentences in appellant's case, it could only impose concurrent sentences if the case satisfied the conditions for a downward departure, that is, if it found mitigating circumstances not considered by the Sentencing Commission.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0.  Discerning no such mitigation, the court eschewed a downward departure.  In other words, the court realized that it could impose concurrent sentences as a specie of downward departure, cf. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672030\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Quinones,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/672030/united-states-v-jesus-m-quinones-aka-jesus-m-quinones-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">216</span> </a></span>(authorizing the imposition of consecutive sentences as a specie of upward departure), but it chose not to do so because, in its judgment, the facts did not warrant a downward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This ends our jaunt.

The weight of the evidence heavily preponderates in favor of a finding that appellant knew and believed of the money's origins.  Indeed, appellant wholly fails to demonstrate how and where the district court erred in determining his level of \"knowledge or belief,\" or why the guideline revision makes any real difference in his case.   This failure--typical of litigants who attempt to incorporate by reference arguments which, if made in earnest, deserve individualized attention--is fatal to appellant's cause.

This sortie is moot.  The only practical effect of the adjustment is to raise the TOL from 43 to 45.  Since life imprisonment is mandatory at or above TOL 43, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.2;  see also U.S.S.G. Sec. 5A, comment.  (n. 2) (\"An offense level of more than 43 is to be treated as an offense level of 43.\"), canceling the enhancement would accomplish nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is this court's settled practice not to address an allegedly erroneous sentencing computation if, and to the extent that, correcting it will neither change the defendant's sentence nor relieve him from some unfair collateral consequence.

He also claimed that, on the eve of trial, a prison guard assaulted him, aggravating his condition.

Specifically, the grand jury accused appellant of RICO conspiracy (count 1), failure to file CTRs (counts 2-9), filing false CTRs (counts 10-22), unlawfully structuring monetary transactions to evade filing requirements (counts 23-37), engaging in monetary transactions using property derived from illegal activities (counts 38-98), money laundering (counts 121-33), and interstate travel in aid of racketeering (counts 134-41).  Like the original indictment, the superseding indictment alleged violations of CTR requirements as predicate offenses for the RICO conspiracy and Travel Act counts, and reiterated the forfeiture allegations.

We need not probe the matter of standing for three reasons.

He's a money launderer, then ninety-nine percent of the money that he launders comes from drug money.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> Noting that forfeiture is part of the sentencing process, and that Saccoccia would be present for sentencing, the court suggested to defense counsel that \"to the extent the sentencing includes the potential for forfeiture order, you can be heard on that issue just as you would on any other sentencing issue at that time.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> In discussing substitutions, Saccoccia seeks to incorporate by reference his codefendants' plaint that the court improperly allowed the government to add property subject to forfeiture while the cases were on appeal.  We reject this remonstrance.  The district court did not \"amend\" its judgment, but, rather, ordered forfeiture of substitute assets based on a supportable finding that appellant had transferred forfeited proceeds beyond the jurisdiction of the court.  Contrary to appellant's intimation, this procedure did not insult his constitutional entitlement to due process, nor did it run afoul of the Double Jeopardy Clause</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> The district court imposed forfeiture pursuant to both a money laundering statute, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 982, and a RICO statute, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"671474\"><a href=\"/opinion/671474/united-states-v-robert-joseph-carr-jr-in-no-93-1376-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Sec. 1963. </a></span> Although there are some slight differences in the operation of the two statutes, see <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Saccoccia,</span> <span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">1001</span></span>-05, these differences do not affect our analysis of the extradition issues.  For simplicity's sake, we refer only to the RICO forfeiture statute.  Nonetheless, our discussion is equally applicable to criminal forfeiture under the money laundering laws</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> In large part, the district judge adopted the calculations recommended by the probation department.  We concentrate on how the court arrived at the guideline sentencing range (GSR), and do not differentiate between the judge's original thinking and his acceptance of the probation department's ideas</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> The Sentencing Commission recently submitted to Congress proposed guideline amendments that apparently would reduce the sentence mandated for conduct of the kind at issue here.  See 60 Fed.Reg. 25,074, 25,085-86 (1995).  The proposed changes will become effective on November 1, 1995, absent congressional action to the contrary.  See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(p) (1988).  The Commission has not yet decided whether the changes, if they become law, should apply retrospectively.  See 60 Fed.Reg. at 25,074.  If the amendments are eventually determined to warrant retroactive application, appellant may then be in a position to seek appropriate relief in the district court.  See United States v. Connell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580693\"><a href=\"/opinion/580693/united-states-v-gerald-connell/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span>, 197 n. 10 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Miller, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541764\"><a href=\"/opinion/541764/united-states-v-john-timothy-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span>, 349 (5th Cir.1990).  We express no opinion on the subject, but merely note the possibility and proceed without further reference to what the future may bring</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn28\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28_ref\">28</a>\n        <p> The district court imposed this type of sentence rather than attempting to estimate the length of appellant's life and then fashioning a sentence of corresponding duration.  We find no fault with this approach.  Despite the superficial severity of a 660-year sentence, it is neither more nor less than the functional equivalent of life without parole.  We treat the sentence in this light in evaluating its correctness under the guidelines and its harshness for Eighth Amendment purposes</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> To the extent appellant's argument is based on a claimed congressional preference for concurrent sentences in connection with conspiracy and its object offenses, and in connection with general and specific offenses, the 36 consecutive ten-year sentences imposed for separate violations of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1957 are unaffected.  These sentences total 360 years.  Barring a lifespan of biblical proportions, appellant's time on this mortal coil will not exceed so lengthy an interval</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn30\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30_ref\">30</a>\n        <p> Appellant's reliance on United States v. Heath, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span> </span>(S.D.Fla.1993), is misplaced.  In Heath, the district court, after expressing concern over the proscription against cruel and unusual punishment, declined to impose a life sentence as directed by the guidelines, and instead departed downward by extrapolating from the sentencing table.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 130-32. </span>  We deal with appellant's claim that the court below should have departed downward in Part VI(B), infra</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn31\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31_ref\">31</a>\n        <p> The amendment inserted the words \"or believed\" into section 2S1.1(b)(1), see U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend.  No. 378 (1992), with the result that the guideline, subsequent thereto, read in pertinent part:  \"If the defendant knew or believed that the funds were the proceeds of an unlawful activity involving the manufacture, importation, or distribution of narcotics or other controlled substances, increased [his BOL] by 3 levels.\"  (Emphasis supplied to show added language)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
