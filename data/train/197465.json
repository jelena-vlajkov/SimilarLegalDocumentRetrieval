Upon careful review of the  record and the\r                           \n\nparties'  briefs, we  perceive  no  reason  to  overturn  the\n\nsentence  enhancement  imposed  under  U.S.S.G.    3C1.2  for\n\nreckless  endangerment during  flight.   Defendant's  conduct\n\ncame within the terms of that section, in that he accelerated\n\nhis car  toward a government  agent who had to  jump aside to\n\navoid impact.  See U.S.S.G.   2A1.4 (defining \"reckless\").\r                              \n\n     Further, the district  court was not required  to credit\n\ndefendant's claim that he thought he  was fleeing from would-\n\nbe   assailants,  particularly   as  the   government  agents\n\nidentified themselves before defendant attempted to flee.  We\n\nrequire no  additional findings on  that point.  See  Fed. R.\r                                                                \n\nCrim. P. 32(c)(1); U.S.S.G.   6A1.3.\n\n     Finally, the district court was not disabled from making\n\nthe  sentence  enhancement  by the  parties'  stipulation  of\n\nfacts, which omitted the circumstances of defendant's flight.\n\nThe district court properly based defendant's sentence on all\n\nthe  relevant  facts,  including  those  in  the pre-sentence\n\ninvestigation report, which  facts defendant has  not denied.\n\nSee U.S.S.G.   6B1.4(d).\r               \n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. R. 27.1.\r                               \n\n                             -2-\r\n",
