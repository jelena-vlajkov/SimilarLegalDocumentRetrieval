The remaining  two panelists\ntherefore issue this opinion pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   46(d).\n\n                                2\n\n          SELYA, Circuit  Judge.   A jury convicted  Nicholas and\n                               \n\nWilliam   Limberopoulos,  both  pharmacists,   of  conspiring  to\n\ndispense,  without  proper  prescriptions,  approximately  18,000\n\npills,  about 12,000 of which were Percodan or Percocet and about\n\n4,000   of  which  were  Valium.    See  21  U.S.C.     841(a)(1)\n                                       \n\n(distributing   or  dispensing  addictive  drugs);  21  U.S.C.   \n\n843(a)(2) (false  DEA numbers);  21 U.S.C.    843(a)(4)(A) (false\n\nprescriptions); 21 U.S.C.   846 (conspiracy).  At sentencing, the\n\ndistrict court  departed from the specified  guideline sentencing\n\nranges (GSRs)    235-293 months for  Nicholas and 188-235  months\n\nfor  his  son, William    and  instead  sentenced Nicholas  to 36\n\nmonths in prison  and William to 30 months in  prison.  The court\n\ndeparted  because,  in its  view,  the  defendants' conduct  fell\n\noutside the \"heartland\" of the unlawful-drug-trafficking statute,\n\n21  U.S.C.   841, but within the \"heartland\" of an unlawful-drug-\n\nprescribing statute, 21 U.S.C.   843.  Since this latter statute,\n\nwhich  is regulatory in nature, limits prison terms to a 48-month\n\nmaximum, far less than  the maximum under section 841,  the court\n\nfelt justified in departing downward.\n\n          Both sides appeal.   We agree with  the government that\n\nthe  district  court's  \"heartland\" determinations  rest  upon an\n\nerroneous  conception  of the  unlawful-drug-prescribing statute.\n\nWe  do not accept  the defendants' arguments  on this, or  on any\n\nother issue.  Consequently, we affirm the defendants' convictions\n\nand  remand the  case for  resentencing.   We specify  that, even\n\nthough we  find the  court's given ground  for departure  legally\n\n                                3\n\ninadequate,  the  court remains  free  to  consider departure  if\n\nother, legally adequate reasons exist.\n\n                                I\n\n                            Background\n                                      \n\n                                A.\n\n                            The Trial\n                                     \n\n          As   is   well  known,   the  unlawful-drug-trafficking\n\nstatute,  21  U.S.C.    841,  forbids,  among other  things,  the\n\ndistribution, dispensing, or possession with intent to distribute\n\nof highly addictive  \"Schedule II\" drugs.   Other less well-known\n\nstatutes  apply  to  pharmacists,  requiring  that  they maintain\n\ninventory  records, dispense  drugs only  in pursuance  of proper\n\nprescriptions, and  keep copies  of all such  prescriptions, duly\n\ncanceled  to prevent unauthorized reuse.   See 21  U.S.C.    827-\n                                              \n\n830.  What we  have called the unlawful-drug-prescribing statute,\n\n21 U.S.C.   843, makes it a crime, among other things, to violate\n\ncertain of these record-keeping requirements. \n\n          In  this case,  the  government charged  the defendants\n\nboth with  violating  the unlawful-drug-prescribing  statute,  21\n\nU.S.C.    843, and with conspiring  to violate the unlawful-drug-\n\ntrafficking statute,  21 U.S.C.    841.   It introduced  evidence\n\nthat, in essence, showed the following:\n\n          1.   In  1988  and  again  in  1989,  Drug  Enforcement\n          Administration (DEA) agents found that Limby's Pharmacy\n          in Lowell, Massachusetts had not kept inventory records\n          of its addictive drugs.   The agents seized a  group of\n          Limby's  canceled  prescriptions (written  between 1986\n          and 1988) and concluded that they were fraudulent.\n\n                                4\n\n          2.  Seven physicians testified that they had not signed\n          their  names   to  particular  prescriptions,   as  the\n          pharmacy's records indicated.   Some of these witnesses\n          pointed out that  the prescriptions bore  signatures or\n          customer  names  that   seemed  not  only  false,   but\n          obviously so,  as, for example, the  customer name \"Tin\n          Can\" on a prescription form falsely bearing the name of\n          a  Vietnamese physician.    An eighth  doctor had  died\n          before   the  time   of   the  purported   issuance  of\n          prescriptions   bearing  his   name.     Five  of   the\n          \"recipients\" listed on  the prescriptions, according to\n          their own testimony or that of their relatives, had not\n          requested,   or   received,   the   drugs   purportedly\n          prescribed.\n\n          3.   A drug addict  testified that he  had often bought\n          addictive  drugs  at  Limby's,   without  prescription,\n          between  1986 and 1987.   He added  that Limby's clerk,\n          from  whom he bought the  drugs, told him  not to worry\n          about the  fact that  Nicholas Limberopoulos knew  that\n          the clerk was selling him addictive drugs. \n\nOn the basis of  this, and related, evidence, the  jury convicted\n\nNicholas Limberopoulos,  who owned  Limby's  Pharmacy and  worked\n\nthere occasionally, of writing 13  false prescriptions.1  See  21\n                                                             \n\nU.S.C.   843(a)(4)(A).  It convicted his son, William, who worked\n\nat Limby's  regularly, of  writing 39 other  false prescriptions.\n\nSee id.  It  convicted William, but acquitted Nicholas,  of using\n      \n\nfalse DEA numbers.  See 21  U.S.C.   843(a)(2).  And it convicted\n                       \n\nboth defendants  of conspiring  to distribute addictive  drugs to\n\nothers.  See 21 U.S.C.    841, 846.\n            \n\n                                B\n\n                            Sentencing\n                                      \n\n          At sentencing, the district  court first calculated the\n\nGSRs,  properly using the June 15, 1988 version of the guidelines\n\n                    \n\n1One  of the  counts of  conviction has  since been  dismissed on\nmotion of the government.\n\n                                5\n\n(to which we shall refer throughout).  The court referred to  the\n\nguideline  applicable to  a  conspiracy to  dispense Schedule  II\n\ndrugs  unlawfully,  see U.S.S.G.    2D1.4  &amp;  App. A-19,  as that\n                       \n\nguideline  instructs,  found  the  weight of  the  various  pills\n\ninvolved, and  converted these weights into  an equivalent weight\n\nin heroin.  The court did so by aggregating the weight of all the\n\npills   listed  on   the  false   prescriptions   underlying  the\n\nsubstantive counts on  which either Nicholas or William  had been\n\nconvicted (as well  as a few other pills listed  on a small group\n\nof related prescriptions).  See U.S.S.G.   1B1.3(a)(2) &amp; comment.\n                               \n\n(2).  For  example, the  jury found Nicholas  responsible for  13\n\nfalse  prescriptions, which,  taken  together, accounted  for the\n\ndispensing  of 275 grams of  Percocet and 392.7  grams of Valium.\n\nThe jury  found William responsible for  92 violations concerning\n\nfalse  prescriptions  and  DEA numbers,  which,  taken  together,\n\ninvolved 2145 grams of Percocet, 1720 grams of Percodan, and 50.5\n\ngrams of  Valium.   The guidelines specified  that these  amounts\n\n(plus the weight of  the few additional related pills)  should be\n\ntreated  as  the equivalent  of between  3  and 9.9  kilograms of\n\nheroin, yielding a base offense level of 34.  The court added two\n\nmore  levels for each defendant's \"abuse of a position of trust,\"\n\nU.S.S.G.    3B1.3, and it added two further levels for Nicholas's\n\n\"obstruction of  justice.\"  Id.    3C1.1.  The result    level 38\n                              \n\nfor  Nicholas and level 36 for William    produced GSRs for these\n\ntwo first-time offenders of 235-293 months  for Nicholas and 188-\n\n235 months for William.\n\n                                6\n\n          The lower  court then  departed downward from  the GSRs\n\nbecause it believed that the defendants' conduct amounted, not to\n\nunlawful  drug   trafficking,  but,   rather,  to  the   kind  of\n\n\"regulatory\" offense forbidden  by the  unlawful-drug-prescribing\n\nstatute, with  its maximum penalty of  48 months in prison.   The\n\ncourt wrote:\n\n          [I]t is the case here that  the object of the\n          conspiracy charged,  the charged part  of the\n          conspiracy, is dispensing  drugs pursuant  to\n          prescriptions not issued  for [a]  legitimate\n          medical purpose.  That is also the essence of\n          the substantive offenses charged.\n\n          Under  these  circumstances,  the  mechanical\n          application of [the] guidelines  with respect\n          to count 1 [drug  trafficking] significantly,\n          significantly, overstates  the seriousness of\n          the predicate and substantive offenses.  This\n          case is not  a typical drug  conspiracy case.\n          Indeed, all  of the substantive  offenses are\n          violations of a regulatory statute [21 U.S.C.\n             843], and  Congress's intent  with respect\n          thereto was, in this  case, overridden by the\n          use of sections 846 [the  conspiracy statute]\n          and 841 [the drug  trafficking statute] . . .\n          . Accordingly, I shall depart for the reasons\n          I have just mentioned.\n\nThis said, the court  imposed a 36-month prison term  on Nicholas\n\nand a  30-month prison term on  William.  The government  and the\n\ndefendants now cross-appeal.\n\n                                II\n\n                     The Government's Appeal\n                                            \n\n          The government  appeals the court's decision  to depart\n\ndownward.   It acknowledges  that the  district  court has  broad\n\npower to depart from a properly calculated sentencing range in an\n\nunusual  case   a case  that lies outside  the \"heartland\" of the\n\n                                7\n\nbase  guideline that would otherwise apply.  See United States v.\n                                                              \n\nRivera, 994 F.2d 942, 947 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Diaz-\n                                                                 \n\nVillafane, 874 F.2d 43, 49 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 862\n                                                   \n\n(1989); see also  U.S.S.G. Ch.  I, Pt. A,  intro. comment.  4(b).\n                \n\nBut the sentencing court must  give its reason(s) for  departing,\n\nsee 18 U.S.C.   3553(c)(2); and the government asks this court to\n   \n\nreview  the legal  adequacy  of those  reasons,  as well  as  the\n\nreasonableness  of the result.   See Rivera, 994  F.2d at 950-52;\n                                           \n\nDiaz-Villafane,  874 F.2d at 50; see also 18 U.S.C.   3742(e)(3).\n                                         \n\nIn  particular, the government urges us to find that the district\n\ncourt's reason  for departing reflects a  misunderstanding of the\n\nbasic aim that animates the unlawful-drug-prescribing statute.  \n\n          The district  court's reason for departing  here is its\n\nprofessed  belief  that  defendants'  conduct  fell  outside  the\n\n\"heartland\" of  the strict unlawful-drug-trafficking  statute, 21\n\nU.S.C.    841,  but within  the \"heartland\"  of the  more lenient\n\nunlawful-drug-prescribing statute, 21  U.S.C.   843.  That  is to\n\nsay,  the  court  thought  that  the  offenders'  conduct,  while\n\ntechnically falling  within a specific statute  and guideline, in\n\nreality more  closely resembled conduct forbidden  by a different\n\nstatute  and guideline  (as,  for example,  a  technical tax  law\n\nconviction might involve conduct  more appropriately described as\n\n\"insider trading\").    And, for  that reason,  it concluded  that\n\ndeparture was appropriate.\n\n          The  district  court  misunderstood   the  relationship\n\nbetween the two relevant statutes   the unlawful-drug-trafficking\n\n                                8\n\nstatute,  section 841, and the unlawful-drug-prescribing statute,\n\nsection 843    and therefore, misapplied its  theory of departure\n\nhere.   The  court  seemed  to  think  that  the  former  statute\n\nprimarily  targets non-pharmacists (those,  say, who sell illegal\n\ndrugs  on  the  street),   while  the  latter  primarily  targets\n\npharmacists  selling drugs  unlawfully  without prescriptions  in\n\ntheir  shops.   For  that reason,  it  felt that  the defendants'\n\nconduct more appropriately fell within the \"heartland\" of section\n\n843, not section 841.  Our  examination of the history and use of\n\nthe two  statutes, however, indicates that they  basically make a\n\ndifferent  distinction     a  distinction  between unlawful  drug\n\ndistribution  on one  hand,  and unlawful  record-keeping on  the\n\nother hand.   Here,  moreover, the  defendants' conduct seems  to\n\ninvolve the former considerably more than the latter.\n\n          We begin  the process of adding flesh to this barebones\n\nlegal conclusion about the  interrelationship of the two statutes\n\nby remarking the obvious:  the unlawful-drug-trafficking statute,\n\n21  U.S.C.   841, does  not exempt pharmacists  who sell narcotic\n\ndrugs  without  prescriptions, nor  does  it  suggest that  their\n\nconduct  is somehow less seriously wrong than the conduct of non-\n\npharmacist drug dealers.  On the contrary, the statute applies to\n\nthe two groups' conduct in the same  way.  The statute's language\n\nsimply  makes   it  a  crime  \"knowingly   or  intentionally\"  to\n\n\"distribute or  dispense\" narcotic drugs.   And this  language is\n\nreinforced  by well-established  case law  making clear  that the\n\nstatute  applies   to  a  pharmacist's   (or  physician's)  drug-\n\n                                9\n\ndispensing activities  so long  as  they fall  outside the  usual\n\ncourse of professional practice.

Cf. Moore, 423 U.S.\n                                                       \n\nat  138-39 (implicitly  approving a  jury instruction  explaining\n\nthat a physician could be  convicted if he knowingly  distributed\n\ncontrolled drugs  \"other than in  good faith .  . . in  the usual\n\ncourse of a professional practice\"); United States v.

It is certainly arguable that,  at\n      \n\nthe  very least,  that  kind of  \"good  faith\" case  would  skirt\n\nsection 841's  heartland.  But if  the drug-dispensing pharmacist\n\nknows that a  customer not  only lacks a  valid prescription  but\n\nalso will not use the drugs for legitimate medical purposes, then\n\nsection  841 applies in full flower and treats the dispenser like\n\na  pusher.   See  Moore,  423  U.S. at  142-43.    Indeed, it  is\n                       \n\ndifficult to find a relevant difference between a pharmacist who,\n\nwithout proper prescriptions, knowingly supplies a drug addict or\n\ntrafficker with narcotics, and any other drug dealer who does the\n\nsame.\n\n          Another line of reasoning leads to the same conclusion.\n\nThe unlawful-drug-prescribing statute, 21  U.S.C.   843, is aimed\n\nfor the  most part at a  pharmacist's knowing failure to  use and\n\nmaintain proper  prescription  forms, registration  numbers,  and\n\nkindred  records.   Such  a failure  might,  or might  not,  come\n\naccompanied with  the pharmacist's  knowing sale of  narcotics to\n\naddicts  or traffickers.    The pharmacist,  for example,  simply\n\nmight  have failed to report his drug supply properly, see, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited States v.

Pastor, 557 F.2d 930  (2d Cir. 1977); or, he might have\n                \n\nused an expired DEA registration number in filling a prescription\n\nfor a customer whom he believed legitimately needed the drugs for\n\n                                11\n\nmedicinal purposes, see, e.g., United States v. Carranza, 632  F.\n                                                        \n\nSupp. 1030 (S.D.N.Y. 1986).   The provision's legislative history\n\nindicates  that Congress intended it chiefly  to address a threat\n\nto the integrity of  the regulatory system, i.e., the  system for\n                                                \n\nadministrative control of the legitimate drug industry.   See 116\n                                                             \n\nCong.  Rec.  996-98  (1970) (statements  of  Sen.  Dodd  and Sen.\n\nGriffin);  see  also  Moore, 423  U.S.  at  135.   The  statute's\n                           \n\ncomparatively low  maximum penalty  provision suggests  the same.\n\nCompare 21 U.S.C.    843(c) (48-month maximum) with id.    841(b)\n                                                      \n\n(life imprisonment maximum).\n\n          Our  search of  the  case law  confirms the  regulatory\n\nthrust  of section  843.   Close  perscrutation reveals  that the\n\ngovernment has used section  843, in separate prosecutions, where\n\nregulatory, not  drug-trafficking, problems  are at issue.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  Sterber, 846 F.2d at  842; United States  v.

The fact  that the  government sometimes\n\ncharges  violations  of  both  sections  841  and  843  in  drug-\n\ntrafficking  cases, see,  e.g., Vamos, 797  F.2d at  1148; United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Devous, 764 F.2d  1349, 1351 (10th  Cir. 1985); United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Goldfine, 538 F.2d  815,817 (9th Cir.  1976), does not\n                   \n\nshow the contrary, for in such instances,  if the same conduct is\n\ninvolved, section 843 would be a lesser included offense.  \n\n          In the  case before us, the government claimed that the\n\ndefendants  systematically and  knowingly  sold  narcotic  drugs,\n\nwithout proper  prescriptions, to  drug addicts and  drug dealers\n\n                                12\n\nwhom they knew had no legitimate medical need for the drugs.  The\n\ncourt  instructed the jury that it could acquit the defendants if\n\nit found  that  they had  acted  in \"good  faith,\" but  the  jury\n\ndeclined to do  so; it thereby  accepted the government's  claims\n\nthat  the defendants acted with  knowledge and evil  intent.  For\n\nthis  reason, one  cannot  easily characterize  their conduct  as\n\ninvolving, simply or only,  the kind of record-keeping violations\n\nat which section 843  seems basically aimed, and which  appear to\n\nprovide the  rationale for its 48-month  ceiling on imprisonment.\n\nThus, the district court's view that the defendants' conduct fell\n\nwithin  the \"heartland\" of section  843, but not  of section 841,\n\nreflects a  misunderstanding of the  basic objectives of  the two\n\nstatutes and their interplay.2   That being so, we must set aside\n\nthe defendants'  sentences and return the  case for resentencing.\n\n                    \n\n2Our determination  that the defendants' conduct,  as charged and\nproven, fell within the \"heartland\" of section 841 bears a strong\nanalytical resemblance to our recent decision in United States v.\n                                                              \nLeBlanc,     F.3d    , (1st Cir. 1994) [No. 93-1998].  There, the\n       \ndistrict court,  confronted  with bookmakers  who  had  laundered\ngambling  proceeds and  who stood  convicted of  violating, inter\n                                                                 \nalia,  18  U.S.C.      1956-1957  (proscribing  \"structuring\"  of\n    \ncertain  monetary transactions),  departed downward  to make  the\nsentences  commensurate  with  the  relatively  modest  GSR  that\ncustomarily  characterized gambling  offenses  (rather  than  the\nrelatively  steep   GSR  that  customarily   characterized  money\nlaundering  offenses).  The  court premised the  departure on the\nground  that the  money laundering  offenses \"stem[med]  from the\nprior  specified  unlawful  activity  of  operating  an   illegal\ngambling business,\"  and,  therefore, fell  \"outside  . .  .  the\n'heartland' of  the money  laundering  guidelines.\"   Id. at     \n                                                         \n[slip  op.  at  11].    We  reversed,  holding  that,  since  the\nproscribed conduct  \"not only comes  within the plain  meaning of\n[the  anti-structuring statute],  but  also was  within the  full\ncontemplation  of Congress when it enacted  that statute,\" id. at\n                                                              \n     [slip op.  at 15],  the court's  stated ground  of departure\ncould not be upheld, id. at 16-17.  So it is here.\n                        \n\n                                13\n\nSee Rivera, 994 F.2d  at 951 (explaining that an  appellate court\n          \n\nwill review a purely legal determination without deference to the\n\ndistrict court).\n\n          Counsel for  the defendants have argued  that there are\n\nseveral other special features of  this case that make  departure\n\nappropriate.   We express no  view about whether  that is,  or is\n\nnot, so.  Departure decisions are for the sentencing court in the\n\nfirst  instance.  On remand,  the district court  remains free to\n\nconsider departure for other reasons.  See id. at 956.\n                                              \n\n                               III\n\n                 Nicholas Limberopoulos's Appeal\n                                                \n\n          In Nicholas Limberopoulos's appeal, he claims primarily\n\nthat the district court did not correctly calculate the GSR (from\n\nwhich  it  then  departed).    We  find  no legal  error  in  the\n\nchallenged calculations.\n\n          1.  The Number  of Pills.  The guideline  applicable to\n                                  \n\ndrug  trafficking  conspiracies3 relates  base offense  levels to\n\nthe  amount   of   \"heroin-equivalent\"  drug   involved  in   the\n\nconspiracy.  See  U.S.S.G.    2D1.1 (Drug Quantity  Table).   The\n                \n\namount of heroin-equivalent drug depends upon the total weight of\n\nthe Percodan, Percocet, and other pills, which is  then converted\n\ninto  heroin  equivalents.    See,  id.,  comment.  (n.10)  (Drug\n                                       \n\n                    \n\n3Technically,  there are  two statutes  involved in the  count of\nconviction here.  21 U.S.C.   846 outlaws conspiracies to violate\ndrug  trafficking laws, while 21  U.S.C.   841  is the particular\ndrug trafficking law that these defendants allegedly conspired to\nviolate.  For ease in reference, we shall refer to the conspiracy\nas a \"section 841 conspiracy.\"\n\n                                14\n\nEquivalency  Table).   Recognizing  that, in  this instance,  the\n\ntotal weight of the  pills depends upon the total number of pills\n\nfor which each defendant  is responsible,  Nicholas Limberopoulos\n\nargues that the  district court wrongly  attributed to him  pills\n\nfor which William, not he, should have been held accountable.  He\n\nrests this conclusion  on the  premise that the  jury might  have\n\nthought  that he was involved  in a conspiracy  not with William,\n\nbut  with others; and  that, if the  jury did think  so, it would\n\nalso have thought that William's pills had nothing to do with the\n\nconspiracy underbracing Nicholas's conviction.\n\n          The  problem with  this thesis  is that  the guidelines\n\nnormally  leave  to  the  sentencing  judge,  not  the jury,  the\n\ndetermination of the \"conduct\"  that is \"relevant\" to sentencing.\n\nSee U.S.S.G.    6A1.3.   Nothing the jury  decided prevented  the\n   \n\njudge  from finding  a conspiracy  between Nicholas  and William.\n\nFurthermore,  the  evidence  to  support  a  finding  of  such  a\n\nconspiracy, whether by judge or jury, is ample.\n\n          The  evidence showed, for  example, that Nicholas owned\n\nLimby's Pharmacy.  He worked there on weekends and some weekdays.\n\nWilliam, his son, worked there  most weekdays and occasionally on\n\nweekends.   The only  other employee involved  in drug-dispensing\n\nwas a clerk.  The unlawful sales involved a large number of pills\n\nand took place at frequent intervals over a period of two  years.\n\nThe clerk told a  drug-addict customer (who had obvious  physical\n\nsymptoms of drug withdrawal)  that it did not matter  if Nicholas\n\nknew that  the clerk was  selling drugs to  the addict without  a\n\n                                15\n\nproper prescription.  From this evidence the court (and the jury,\n\ntoo) might  reasonably have  concluded that Nicholas  and William\n\neach knew  the other was  dispensing drugs  unlawfully, and  that\n\neach agreed  to help the  other do so  through the ownership  and\n\noperation of the pharmacy, the maintenance of  false records, and\n\nthe  like.  Such an  implicit agreement amounts  to a conspiracy.\n\nSee, e.g., Direct Sales Co.  v. United States, 319 U.S.  703, 714\n                                             \n\n(1943).   The  court,  therefore, could  reasonably attribute  to\n\nNicholas the pills  that William  sold, having found  them to  be\n\n\"part of  the same  . .  . common  scheme or plan.\"   U.S.S.G.   \n\n1B1.3(a)(2).    By  like  token, the  court  could  attribute  to\n\nNicholas  pills  that  William  improperly  dispensed  prior   to\n\nFebruary  10,  1987 (the  earliest  date of  a  prescription that\n\nNicholas canceled).\n\n          2.   The Weight.   Nicholas also argues  that the court\n                         \n\nerred  in  calculating drug  weight by,  in effect,  weighing the\n\nentire  pill, and, thus, counting the weight of both narcotic and\n\nnonnarcotic ingredients (increasing the  weight, say, of a single\n\nPercocet pill from roughly five one-thousandths to five-tenths of\n\na gram).   In doing so,  however, the court  simply followed  the\n\ninstructions  of the  Sentencing Commission,  which  tells judges\n\nthat the\n\n          scale amounts for  all controlled  substances\n          refer to the  total weight of  the controlled\n          substance.  Consistent with the provisions of\n          the Anti-Drug Abuse Act,  if any mixture of a\n          compound  contains any detectable amount of a\n          controlled  substance,  the entire  amount of\n          the  mixture or compound  shall be considered\n          in measuring the quantity.\n\n                                16\n\nU.S.S.G.   2D1.1 (Drug Quantity Table, n.*).\n\n          All seven circuits that have considered the matter have\n\nheld  that this  language  (or the  language  of a  substantially\n\nsimilar  amended version of the note, see id. (Nov. 1989)), means\n                                            \n\nwhat  it says, namely, that the sentencing court must include the\n\nweight of an entire  pharmaceutical pill and not just  the weight\n\nof  the  active  narcotic  ingredients.

We  agree with this\n        \n\nauthority.\n\n          The defendants sing one  esoteric tune which, they tell\n\nus, the other courts did not fully consider.  They point out that\n\nthe instruction  we have quoted  prefaces its statement  with the\n\nwords \"[c]onsistent  with the  provisions of the  Anti-Drug Abuse\n\nAct.\"   They  then assert  that that  Act specifies  weighing the\n\n\"entire mixture  or compound\" for  street drugs, such  as heroin,\n                                         \n\nbut says nothing about pharmaceutical drugs.   The defendants add\n                                     \n\nthat the rationale the Supreme Court has identified as underlying\n\n                                17\n\nthe   use  of  gross,  as  opposed  to  net,  weights     namely,\n\nmaintaining  serious punishment  for  street  pushers of  diluted\n\nmixtures, see Chapman  v. United  States, 111 S.  Ct. 1919,  1927\n                                        \n\n(1991)    does not make sense, and, hence, should not apply, when\n\npharmaceutical drugs are at issue.\n\n          The chief problem with  this construct is that it  does\n\nnot  show  an inconsistency  between the  Act and  the Sentencing\n\nCommission's instruction.  The  Act does not forbid use  of gross\n\npharmaceutical drug weights  as a  way to measure  just how  many\n\npills,  say of Percodan, warrant  the same punishment  as a given\n\namount of heroin.   Nor have defendants  convinced us that it  is\n\nirrational to  tie these  punishment equivalencies to  gross pill\n\nweight,  rather than  applying some  mechanical operation  to net\n\nweight  (say, multiplying  active ingredient  weight by  100) and\n\nthereby  reaching  approximately  the same  punishment  results.4\n\nNor, finally, is it clear to us what the use of  gross weight for\n\npurposes   of  conversion  has  to  do  with  the  existence,  or\n\nnonexistence, of street pushers of pharmaceutical drugs.\n\n                                IV\n\n                  William Limberopoulos's Appeal\n                                                \n\n          William's   appeal   repeats   various  of   Nicholas's\n\narguments,  which  we  reject   for  reasons  previously  stated.\n\nWilliam  also makes  two fresh  arguments.   First, he  points to\n\nBruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968), a case in which the\n                       \n\n                    \n\n4Other  circuits have  found  this approach  to be  rational and,\nconsequently,  have rejected  similar  importunings.   See, e.g.,\n                                                                \nCrowell, 9 F.3d at 1454; Shabazz, 933 F.2d at 1036-37.\n                                \n\n                                18\n\nCourt held  that admission of incriminating  statements made out-\n\nof-court by  a nontestifying codefendant (unavailable  for cross-\n\nexamination)  entitled  the defendant  to  a  new, and  separate,\n\ntrial.   He then claims  that three such  pieces of evidence were\n\nadmitted  against him  here, namely,  (1) portions  of Nicholas's\n\ngrand jury testimony, (2)  a false exculpatory statement made  by\n\nNicholas  to his attorney, and (3) Nicholas's action in giving up\n\nLimby's DEA  license,  which in  William's  view amounted  to  an\n\nadmission of guilt. \n\n          It is unclear whether William objected to this evidence\n\nat the  time of its admission (though he did move for a severance\n\nwith regard to  the grand jury testimony before  trial).  We have\n\nnonetheless reviewed  the record  before us to  determine whether\n\nthis  evidence is of  the sort to which  Bruton applies, that is,\n                                               \n\nevidence that  has the \"'powerfully incriminating'  effect of one\n\naccomplice  pointing  the  finger directly  at  another,  without\n\nsubjecting  himself  to  cross-examination.\"   United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nDiGregorio, 605 F.2d  1184, 1190 (1st Cir.)

We conclude\n                            \n\nthat it is not.  \n\n          The grand  jury testimony  that the government  read at\n\ntrial does not implicate William.  The remaining portions of that\n\ntestimony suggest that  some of the false prescriptions  may have\n                                                            \n\n                                19\n\nbeen  in  William's handwriting,  but  they add  little  to other\n\nevidence  on  this  point.    Similarly,  Nicholas's  exculpatory\n\nstatements  to his lawyer and his surrender of Limby's license do\n\nnot directly show  William's guilt.   Rather, their relevance  in\n\nthis  respect   requires  a  considerable   chain  of  subsidiary\n\ninferences (i.e.,  that the exculpatory statement  was an obvious\n                \n\nattempt at  deceit and coverup, or the surrender of the license a\n\nkind of confession, both  showing Nicholas's consciousness of his\n\nown   guilt,  which   knowledge,  through   association,  implies\n\nWilliam's guilt  as well).  Such  out-of-court statements neither\n\nname  nor impugn William directly, and thus cannot be supposed to\n\nhave  implanted in  the  jurors' minds  the  kinds of  powerfully\n\nincriminating impressions  against which  Bruton  protects.   See\n                                                                 \n\nRichardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 208-11 (1986) (explaining that\n                   \n\nBruton applies  to evidence  incriminating on  its  face, not  to\n      \n\ninferential  incrimination,  which  can   be  cured  by  limiting\n\ninstructions);  cf.  DiGregorio, 605  F.2d  at  1190 (ruling  the\n                               \n\nunadorned fact that a codefendant's out-of-court admission tended\n\nto corroborate the government's case against the defendant to  be\n\ninsufficient to trigger Bruton).  Again, in context, this out-of-\n                              \n\ncourt evidence is weak, adding little, if anything, to the weight\n\nof the remaining evidence.   Nor can we find anything  else about\n\nthe  admission of this evidence  that deprived William  of a fair\n\ntrial, \"resulting in a miscarriage of justice.\"  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nMcLaughlin, 957 F.2d 12,  18 (1st Cir. 1992)  (citation omitted).\n          \n\nConsequently, the law does not require relief on this ground.  \n\n                                20\n\n          Second,  William  complains that  the  sentencing court\n\nshould  have  ordered a  mental  examination  under 18  U.S.C.   \n\n3552(c).   That provision, however,  says that  a district  court\n\n\"may\" order a  psychological examination of  the defendant if  it\n    \n\n\"desires  more information than is otherwise available to it as a\n\nbasis  for determining  the mental  condition of  the defendant.\"\n\nId.  (emphasis supplied).   In  this case,  the court  was keenly\n   \n\naware of  William's psychological  difficulties.  The  records he\n\nplaced before the  district judge  showed a history  of drug  and\n\nalcohol  abuse   as  well  as  personality   disorders,  such  as\n\nnarcissism.  The  judge could reasonably have  concluded that the\n\nfirst set of matters  was not directly related to  the sentencing\n\ndecision, see U.S.S.G.    5H1.4, p.s., while a mental examination\n             \n\nwould  add little or  nothing of  value to  what it  already knew\n\nabout the  second.   In our  view, the court  did not  exceed its\n\ndiscretionary authority to decide not to order the examination.5\n\n                                V\n\n                            Conclusion\n                                      \n\n          We  need  go  no   further.    Though  the  combination\n\ncomprises a bitter  pill, defendants' convictions  appear lawful,\n\nbut their  reduced sentences appear to  have been inappropriately\n\nconceived.   Consequently, for the  reasons we have discussed, we\n\naffirm the convictions but vacate the defendants'  sentences.  We\n\n                    \n\n5We  note,  moreover,  that  William  does  not  claim  financial\ninability  to arrange for such an examination at his own expense.\nCf.  18  U.S.C.     3006A(e)(1) (instructing  courts  to  appoint\n  \n\"investigative, expert,  or other services\"  where such  services\nare necessary and the defendant cannot otherwise afford them).\n\n                                21\n\nremand  the  matter  to   the  district  court  for  resentencing\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\nSo ordered.\n           \n\n                                22\n",

See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1) (distributing or dispensing addictive drugs);  21 U.S.C. Sec. 843(a)(2) (false DEA numbers);  21 U.S.C. Sec. 843(a)(4)(A) (false prescriptions);  21 U.S.C. Sec. 846 (conspiracy).  At sentencing, the district court departed from the specified guideline sentencing ranges (GSRs)--235-293 months for Nicholas and 188-235 months for his son, William--and instead sentenced Nicholas to 36 months in prison and William to 30 months in prison.  The court departed because, in its view, the defendants' conduct fell outside the \"heartland\" of the unlawful-drug-trafficking statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841, but within the \"heartland\" of an unlawful-drug-prescribing statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 843.  Since this latter statute, which is regulatory in nature, limits prison terms to a 48-month maximum, far less than the maximum under section 841, the court felt justified in departing downward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both sides appeal.  We agree with the government that the district court's \"heartland\" determinations rest upon an erroneous conception of the unlawful-drug-prescribing statute.  We do not accept the defendants' arguments on this, or on any other issue.  Consequently, we affirm the defendants' convictions and remand the case for resentencing.  We specify that, even though we find the court's given ground for departure legally inadequate, the court remains free to consider departure if other, legally adequate reasons exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>* Background</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>The Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As is well known, the unlawful-drug-trafficking statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841, forbids, among other things, the distribution, dispensing, or possession with intent to distribute of highly addictive \"Schedule II\" drugs.  Other less well-known statutes apply to pharmacists, requiring that they maintain inventory records, dispense drugs only in pursuance of proper prescriptions, and keep copies of all such prescriptions, duly canceled to prevent unauthorized reuse.  See 21 U.S.C. Secs. 827-830.  What we have called the unlawful-drug-prescribing statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 843, makes it a crime, among other things, to violate certain of these recordkeeping requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the government charged the defendants both with violating the unlawful-drug-prescribing statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 843, and with conspiring to violate the unlawful-drug-trafficking statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841.  It introduced evidence that, in essence, showed the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>1.  In 1988 and again in 1989, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents found that Limby's Pharmacy in Lowell, Massachusetts had not kept inventory records of its addictive drugs.  The agents seized a group of Limby's canceled prescriptions (written between 1986 and 1988) and concluded that they were fraudulent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>2. Seven physicians testified that they had not signed their names to particular prescriptions, as the pharmacy's records indicated.  Some of these witnesses pointed out that the prescriptions bore signatures or customer names that seemed not only false, but obviously so, as, for example, the customer name \"Tin Can\" on a prescription form falsely bearing the name of a Vietnamese physician.  An eighth doctor had died before the time of the purported issuance of prescriptions bearing his name.  Five of the \"recipients\" listed on the prescriptions, according to their own testimony or that of their relatives, had not requested, or received, the drugs purportedly prescribed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>3. A drug addict testified that he had often bought addictive drugs at Limby's, without prescription, between 1986 and 1987.  He added that Limby's clerk, from whom he bought the drugs, told him not to worry about the fact that Nicholas Limberopoulos knew that the clerk was selling him addictive drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of this, and related, evidence, the jury convicted Nicholas Limberopoulos, who owned Limby's Pharmacy and worked there occasionally, of writing 13 false prescriptions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 843(a)(4)(A).  It convicted his son, William, who worked at Limby's regularly, of writing 39 other false prescriptions.  See id.   It convicted William, but acquitted Nicholas, of using false DEA numbers.  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 843(a)(2).  And it convicted both defendants of conspiring to distribute addictive drugs to others.  See 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841, 846.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <p>Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court first calculated the GSRs, properly using the June 15, 1988 version of the guidelines (to which we shall refer throughout).  The court referred to the guideline applicable to a conspiracy to dispense Schedule II drugs unlawfully, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.4 &amp; App.  A.19, as that guideline instructs, found the weight of the various pills involved, and converted these weights into an equivalent weight in heroin.  The court did so by aggregating the weight of all the pills listed on the false prescriptions underlying the substantive counts on which either Nicholas or William had been convicted (as well as a few other pills listed on a small group of related prescriptions).  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(2) &amp; comment.  (2).  For example, the jury found Nicholas responsible for 13 false prescriptions, which, taken together, accounted for the dispensing of 275 grams of Percocet and 392.7 grams of Valium.  The jury found William responsible for 92 violations concerning false prescriptions and DEA numbers, which, taken together, involved 2145 grams of Percocet, 1720 grams of Percodan, and 50.5 grams of Valium.  The guidelines specified that these amounts (plus the weight of the few additional related pills) should be treated as the equivalent of between 3 and 9.9 kilograms of heroin, yielding a base offense level of 34.  The court added two more levels for each defendant's \"abuse of a position of trust,\" U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.3, and it added two further levels for Nicholas's \"obstruction of justice.\"   Id. Sec. 3C1.1.  The result--level 38 for Nicholas and level 36 for William--produced GSRs for these two first-time offenders of 235-293 months for Nicholas and 188-235 months for William.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court then departed downward from the GSRs because it believed that the defendants' conduct amounted, not to unlawful drug trafficking, but, rather, to the kind of \"regulatory\" offense forbidden by the unlawful-drug-prescribing statute, with its maximum penalty of 48 months in prison.  The court wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>[I]t is the case here that the object of the conspiracy charged, the charged part of the conspiracy, is dispensing drugs pursuant to prescriptions not issued for [a] legitimate medical purpose.

This case is not a typical drug conspiracy case.  Indeed, all of the substantive offenses are violations of a regulatory statute [21 U.S.C. Sec. 843], and Congress's intent with respect thereto was, in this case, overridden by the use of sections 846 [the conspiracy statute] and 841 [the drug trafficking statute]....  Accordingly, I shall depart for the reasons I have just mentioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This said, the court imposed a 36-month prison term on Nicholas and a 30-month prison term on William.  The government and the defendants now cross-appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>The Government's Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government appeals the court's decision to depart downward.  It acknowledges that the district court has broad power to depart from a properly calculated sentencing range in an unusual case--a case that lies outside the \"heartland\" of the base guideline that would otherwise apply.  See United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 947 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 49 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 862, 110 S.Ct. 177, 107 L.Ed.2d 133 (1989);  see also U.S.S.G. Ch. I, Pt. A, intro. comment. 4(b).  But the sentencing court must give its reason(s) for departing, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(c)(2);  and the government asks this court to review the legal adequacy of those reasons, as well as the reasonableness of the result.  See Rivera, 994 F.2d at 950-52;  Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 50;  see also 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(e)(3).  In particular, the government urges us to find that the district court's reason for departing reflects a misunderstanding of the basic aim that animates the unlawful-drug-prescribing statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's reason for departing here is its professed belief that defendants' conduct fell outside the \"heartland\" of the strict unlawful-drug-trafficking statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841, but within the \"heartland\" of the more lenient unlawful-drug-prescribing statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 843.  That is to say, the court thought that the offenders' conduct, while technically falling within a specific statute and guideline, in reality more closely resembled conduct forbidden by a different statute and guideline (as, for example, a technical tax law conviction might involve conduct more appropriately described as \"insider trading\").  And, for that reason, it concluded that departure was appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court misunderstood the relationship between the two relevant statutes--the unlawful-drug-trafficking statute, section 841, and the unlawful-drug-prescribing statute, section 843--and therefore, misapplied its theory of departure here.  The court seemed to think that the former statute primarily targets non-pharmacists (those, say, who sell illegal drugs on the street), while the latter primarily targets pharmacists selling drugs unlawfully without prescriptions in their shops.  For that reason, it felt that the defendants' conduct more appropriately fell within the \"heartland\" of section 843, not section 841.  Our examination of the history and use of the two statutes, however, indicates that they basically make a different distinction--a distinction between unlawful drug distribution on one hand, and unlawful record-keeping on the other hand.  Here, moreover, the defendants' conduct seems to involve the former considerably more than the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin the process of adding flesh to this barebones legal conclusion about the interrelationship of the two statutes by remarking the obvious:  the unlawful-drug-trafficking statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841, does not exempt pharmacists who sell narcotic drugs without prescriptions, nor does it suggest that their conduct is somehow less seriously wrong than the conduct of non-pharmacist drug dealers.  On the contrary, the statute applies to the two groups' conduct in the same way.  The statute's language simply makes it a crime \"knowingly or intentionally\" to \"distribute or dispense\" narcotic drugs.  And this language is reinforced by well-established case law making clear that the statute applies to a pharmacist's (or physician's) drug-dispensing activities so long as they fall outside the usual course of professional practice.  See United States v. Moore, 423 U.S. 122, 142, 96 S.Ct. 335, 345, 46 L.Ed.2d 333 (1975);  United States v. DeBoer, 966 F.2d 1066, 1068-69 (6th Cir.1992);  United States v. Hughes, 895 F.2d 1135, 1143 (6th Cir.1990);  United States v. Vamos, 797 F.2d 1146, 1152 (2d Cir.1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1036, 107 S.Ct. 888, 93 L.Ed.2d 841 (1987);  United States v. Norris, 780 F.2d 1207, 1209 (5th Cir.1986);  United States v. Lawson, 682 F.2d 480, 482 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 991, 103 S.Ct. 348, 74 L.Ed.2d 387 (1982);  United States v. Hayes, 595 F.2d 258, 260 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 866, 100 S.Ct. 138, 62 L.Ed.2d 89 (1979);  United States v. Kirk, 584 F.2d 773, 784 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1048, 99 S.Ct. 726, 58 L.Ed.2d 708 (1978);  see also 21 C.F.R. Sec. 1306.04(a) (explicitly subjecting a pharmacist to the penalties of section 841 if he knowingly fills a prescription \"not issued in the usual course of professional treatment\");  cf. 21 U.S.C. Sec. 822(b) (exempting pharmacists from section 841 but only \"to the extent authorized by their registration\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This standard might mean that a drug-dispensing pharmacist does not violate section 841 if he believes that a customer (even a customer who lacks a valid prescription) needs the drugs for legitimate medical treatment.  Cf. Moore, 423 U.S. at 138-39, 96 S.Ct. at 343-44 (implicitly approving a jury instruction explaining that a physician could be convicted if he knowingly distributed controlled drugs \"other than in good faith ... in the usual course of a professional practice\");  United States v. Seelig, 622 F.2d 207, 213 (6th Cir.)  (stating that section 841(a)(1) requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt \"that the drugs were distributed outside the usual course of professional practice\"), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 869, 101 S.Ct. 206, 66 L.Ed.2d 89 (1980).  It is certainly arguable that, at the very least, that kind of \"good faith\" case would skirt section 841's heartland.  But if the drug-dispensing pharmacist knows that a customer not only lacks a valid prescription but also will not use the drugs for legitimate medical purposes, then section 841 applies in full flower and treats the dispenser like a pusher.  See Moore, 423 U.S. at 142-43, 96 S.Ct. at 345-46.   Indeed, it is difficult to find a relevant difference between a pharmacist who, without proper prescriptions, knowingly supplies a drug addict or trafficker with narcotics, and any other drug dealer who does the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another line of reasoning leads to the same conclusion.  The unlawful-drug-prescribing statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 843, is aimed for the most part at a pharmacist's knowing failure to use and maintain proper prescription forms, registration numbers, and kindred records.  Such a failure might, or might not, come accompanied with the pharmacist's knowing sale of narcotics to addicts or traffickers.  The pharmacist, for example, simply might have failed to report his drug supply properly, see, e.g., United States v. Sterber, 846 F.2d 842 (2d Cir.1988);  or he might have acquired the narcotics improperly, see, e.g., United States v. Pastor, 557 F.2d 930 (2d Cir.1977);  or, he might have used an expired DEA registration number in filling a prescription for a customer whom he believed legitimately needed the drugs for medicinal purposes, see, e.g., United States v. Carranza, 632 F.Supp. 1030 (S.D.N.Y.1986).  The provision's legislative history indicates that Congress intended it chiefly to address a threat to the integrity of the regulatory system, i.e., the system for administrative control of the legitimate drug industry.  See 116 Cong.  Rec. 996-98 (1970) (statements of Sen.  Dodd and Sen.  Griffin);  see also Moore, 423 U.S. at 135, 96 S.Ct. at 342.   The statute's comparatively low maximum penalty provision suggests the same.  Compare 21 U.S.C. Sec. 843(c) (48-month maximum) with id. Sec. 841(b) (life imprisonment maximum).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our search of the case law confirms the regulatory thrust of section 843.  Close perscrutation reveals that the government has used section 843, in separate prosecutions, where regulatory, not drug-trafficking, problems are at issue.  See, e.g., Sterber, 846 F.2d at 842;  United States v. Cantor, Crim.  No. 91-00021, 1991 WL 161017 (E.D.Pa. Aug. 14, 1991);  Carranza, 632 F.Supp. at 1031.   The fact that the government sometimes charges violations of both sections 841 and 843 in drug-trafficking cases, see, e.g., Vamos, 797 F.2d at 1148;  United States v. Devous, 764 F.2d 1349, 1351 (10th Cir.1985);  United States v. Goldfine, 538 F.2d 815, 817 (9th Cir.1976), does not show the contrary, for in such instances, if the same conduct is involved, section 843 would be a lesser included offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case before us, the government claimed that the defendants systematically and knowingly sold narcotic drugs, without proper prescriptions, to drug addicts and drug dealers whom they knew had no legitimate medical need for the drugs.  The court instructed the jury that it could acquit the defendants if it found that they had acted in \"good faith,\" but the jury declined to do so;  it thereby accepted the government's claims that the defendants acted with knowledge and evil intent.  For this reason, one cannot easily characterize their conduct as involving, simply or only, the kind of recordkeeping violations at which section 843 seems basically aimed, and which appear to provide the rationale for its 48-month ceiling on imprisonment.  Thus, the district court's view that the defendants' conduct fell within the \"heartland\" of section 843, but not of section 841, reflects a misunderstanding of the basic objectives of the two statutes and their interplay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  That being so, we must set aside the defendants' sentences and return the case for resentencing.  See Rivera, 994 F.2d at 951 (explaining that an appellate court will review a purely legal determination without deference to the district court).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel for the defendants have argued that there are several other special features of this case that make departure appropriate.  We express no view about whether that is, or is not, so.  Departure decisions are for the sentencing court in the first instance.  On remand, the district court remains free to consider departure for other reasons.  See id. at 956.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Nicholas Limberopoulos's Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Nicholas Limberopoulos's appeal, he claims primarily that the district court did not correctly calculate the GSR (from which it then departed).  We find no legal error in the challenged calculations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Number of Pills.   The guideline applicable to drug trafficking conspiracies<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> relates base offense levels to the amount of \"heroin-equivalent\" drug involved in the conspiracy.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1 (Drug Quantity Table).  The amount of heroin-equivalent drug depends upon the total weight of the Percodan, Percocet, and other pills, which is then converted into heroin equivalents.  See, id., comment.  (n. 10) (Drug Equivalency Table).  Recognizing that, in this instance, the total weight of the pills depends upon the total number of pills for which each defendant is responsible, Nicholas Limberopoulos argues that the district court wrongly attributed to him pills for which William, not he, should have been held accountable.  He rests this conclusion on the premise that the jury might have thought that he was involved in a conspiracy not with William, but with others;  and that, if the jury did think so, it would also have thought that William's pills had nothing to do with the conspiracy underbracing Nicholas's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with this thesis is that the guidelines normally leave to the sentencing judge, not the jury, the determination of the \"conduct\" that is \"relevant\" to sentencing. See U.S.S.G. Sec. 6A1.3.  Nothing the jury decided prevented the judge from finding a conspiracy between Nicholas and William.  Furthermore, the evidence to support a finding of such a conspiracy, whether by judge or jury, is ample.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence showed, for example, that Nicholas owned Limby's Pharmacy.  He worked there on weekends and some weekdays.  William, his son, worked there most weekdays and occasionally on weekends.  The only other employee involved in drug-dispensing was a clerk.  The unlawful sales involved a large number of pills and took place at frequent intervals over a period of two years.  The clerk told a drug-addict customer (who had obvious physical symptoms of drug withdrawal) that it did not matter if Nicholas knew that the clerk was selling drugs to the addict without a proper prescription.  From this evidence the court (and the jury, too) might reasonably have concluded that Nicholas and William each knew the other was dispensing drugs unlawfully, and that each agreed to help the other do so through the ownership and operation of the pharmacy, the maintenance of false records, and the like.  Such an implicit agreement amounts to a conspiracy.  See, e.g., Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703, 714, 63 S.Ct. 1265, 1270, 87 L.Ed. 1674 (1943).  The court, therefore, could reasonably attribute to Nicholas the pills that William sold, having found them to be \"part of the same ... common scheme or plan.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(2).  By like token, the court could attribute to Nicholas pills that William improperly dispensed prior to February 10, 1987 (the earliest date of a prescription that Nicholas canceled).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Weight.   Nicholas also argues that the court erred in calculating drug weight by, in effect, weighing the entire pill, and, thus, counting the weight of both narcotic and nonnarcotic ingredients (increasing the weight, say, of a single Percocet pill from roughly five one-thousandths to five-tenths of a gram).  In doing so, however, the court simply followed the instructions of the Sentencing Commission, which tells judges that the</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>scale amounts for all controlled substances refer to the total weight of the controlled substance.  Consistent with the provisions of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, if any mixture of a compound contains any detectable amount of a controlled substance, the entire amount of the mixture or compound shall be considered in measuring the quantity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1 (Drug Quantity Table, n. *).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All seven circuits that have considered the matter have held that this language (or the language of a substantially similar amended version of the note, see id.  (Nov.1989)), means what it says, namely, that the sentencing court must include the weight of an entire pharmaceutical pill and not just the weight of the active narcotic ingredients.  See United States v. Crowell, 9 F.3d 1452, 1454 (9th Cir.1993);  United States v. Young, 992 F.2d 207, 209 (8th Cir.1993);  United States v. Blythe, 944 F.2d 356, 362 (7th Cir.1991);  United States v. Shabazz, 933 F.2d 1029, 1032-33 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 431, 116 L.Ed.2d 451 (1991);  United States v.

Meitinger, 901 F.2d 27, 29 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 985, 111 S.Ct. 519, 112 L.Ed.2d 531 (1990);  United States v.

We agree with this authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants sing one esoteric tune which, they tell us, the other courts did not fully consider.  They point out that the instruction we have quoted prefaces its statement with the words \"[c]onsistent with the provisions of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act.\"   They then assert that that Act specifies weighing the \"entire mixture or compound\" for street drugs, such as heroin, but says nothing about pharmaceutical drugs.  The defendants add that the rationale the Supreme Court has identified as underlying the use of gross, as opposed to net, weights--namely, maintaining serious punishment for street pushers of diluted mixtures, see Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 464, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 1927, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991)--does not make sense, and, hence, should not apply, when pharmaceutical drugs are at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The chief problem with this construct is that it does not show an inconsistency between the Act and the Sentencing Commission's instruction.  The Act does not forbid use of gross pharmaceutical drug weights as a way to measure just how many pills, say of Percodan, warrant the same punishment as a given amount of heroin.  Nor have defendants convinced us that it is irrational to tie these punishment equivalencies to gross pill weight, rather than applying some mechanical operation to net weight (say, multiplying active ingredient weight by 100) and thereby reaching approximately the same punishment results.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Nor, finally, is it clear to us what the use of gross weight for purposes of conversion has to do with the existence, or nonexistence, of street pushers of pharmaceutical drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <p>William Limberopoulos's Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">William's appeal repeats various of Nicholas's arguments, which we reject for reasons previously stated.  William also makes two fresh arguments.  First, he points to Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), a case in which the Court held that admission of incriminating statements made out-of-court by a nontestifying codefendant (unavailable for cross-examination) entitled the defendant to a new, and separate, trial.  He then claims that three such pieces of evidence were admitted against him here, namely, (1) portions of Nicholas's grand jury testimony, (2) a false exculpatory statement made by Nicholas to his attorney, and (3) Nicholas's action in giving up Limby's DEA license, which in William's view amounted to an admission of guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unclear whether William objected to this evidence at the time of its admission (though he did move for a severance with regard to the grand jury testimony before trial).  We have nonetheless reviewed the record before us to determine whether this evidence is of the sort to which Bruton applies, that is, evidence that has the \" 'powerfully incriminating' effect of one accomplice pointing the finger directly at another, without subjecting himself to cross-examination.\"  United States v. DiGregorio, 605 F.2d 1184, 1190 (1st Cir.)  (quoting Bruton, 391 U.S. at 135, 88 S.Ct. at 1627), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 937, 100 S.Ct. 287, 62 L.Ed.2d 197 (1979);  see also United States v. Nason, 9 F.3d 155, 160 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1331, 127 L.Ed.2d 678 (1994);  United States v. Barnett, 989 F.2d 546, 558 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 148, 126 L.Ed.2d 110 (1993).  We conclude that it is not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grand jury testimony that the government read at trial does not implicate William.  The remaining portions of that testimony suggest that some of the false prescriptions may have been in William's handwriting, but they add little to other evidence on this point.  Similarly, Nicholas's exculpatory statements to his lawyer and his surrender of Limby's license do not directly show William's guilt.  Rather, their relevance in this respect requires a considerable chain of subsidiary inferences (i.e., that the exculpatory statement was an obvious attempt at deceit and coverup, or the surrender of the license a kind of confession, both showing Nicholas's consciousness of his own guilt, which knowledge, through association, implies William's guilt as well).  Such out-of-court statements neither name nor impugn William directly, and thus cannot be supposed to have implanted in the jurors' minds the kinds of powerfully incriminating impressions against which Bruton protects.  See Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 208-11, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 1707-09, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987) (explaining that Bruton applies to evidence incriminating on its face, not to inferential incrimination, which can be cured by limiting instructions);  cf. DiGregorio, 605 F.2d at 1190 (ruling the unadorned fact that a codefendant's out-of-court admission tended to corroborate the government's case against the defendant to be insufficient to trigger Bruton ).   Again, in context, this out-of-court evidence is weak, adding little, if anything, to the weight of the remaining evidence.  Nor can we find anything else about the admission of this evidence that deprived William of a fair trial, \"resulting in a miscarriage of justice.\"  United States v. McLaughlin, 957 F.2d 12, 18 (1st Cir.1992) (citation omitted).  Consequently, the law does not require relief on this ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, William complains that the sentencing court should have ordered a mental examination under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3552(c).  That provision, however, says that a district court \"may\" order a psychological examination of the defendant if it \"desires more information than is otherwise available to it as a basis for determining the mental condition of the defendant.\"   Id. (emphasis supplied).  In this case, the court was keenly aware of William's psychological difficulties.  The records he placed before the district judge showed a history of drug and alcohol abuse as well as personality disorders, such as narcissism.  The judge could reasonably have concluded that the first set of matters was not directly related to the sentencing decision, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 5H1.4, p.s., while a mental examination would add little or nothing of value to what it already knew about the second.  In our view, the court did not exceed its discretionary authority to decide not to order the examination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Though the combination comprises a bitter pill, defendants' convictions appear lawful, but their reduced sentences appear to have been inappropriately conceived.  Consequently, for the reasons we have discussed, we affirm the convictions but vacate the defendants' sentences.

Secs. 1956-1957 (proscribing \"structuring\" of certain monetary transactions), departed downward to make the sentences commensurate with the relatively modest GSR that customarily characterized gambling offenses (rather than the relatively steep GSR that customarily characterized money laundering offenses).  The court premised the departure on the ground that the money laundering offenses \"stem[med] from the prior specified unlawful activity of operating an illegal gambling business,\" and, therefore, fell \"outside ... the 'heartland' of the money laundering guidelines.\"  Id. at 345.   We reversed, holding that, since the proscribed conduct \"not only comes within the plain meaning of [the anti-structuring statute], but also was within the full contemplation of Congress when it enacted that statute,\" id. at 347, the court's stated ground of departure could not be upheld, id. at 347-48.

See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1) (distributing or dispensing addictive drugs);  21 U.S.C. Sec. 843(a)(2) (false DEA numbers);  21 U.S.C. Sec. 843(a)(4)(A) (false prescriptions);  21 U.S.C. Sec. 846 (conspiracy).  At sentencing, the district court departed from the specified guideline sentencing ranges (GSRs)--235-293 months for Nicholas and 188-235 months for his son, William--and instead sentenced Nicholas to 36 months in prison and William to 30 months in prison.  The court departed because, in its view, the defendants' conduct fell outside the \"heartland\" of the unlawful-drug-trafficking statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841, but within the \"heartland\" of an unlawful-drug-prescribing statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 843.  Since this latter statute, which is regulatory in nature, limits prison terms to a 48-month maximum, far less than the maximum under section 841, the court felt justified in departing downward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both sides appeal.  We agree with the government that the district court's \"heartland\" determinations rest upon an erroneous conception of the unlawful-drug-prescribing statute.  We do not accept the defendants' arguments on this, or on any other issue.  Consequently, we affirm the defendants' convictions and remand the case for resentencing.  We specify that, even though we find the court's given ground for departure legally inadequate, the court remains free to consider departure if other, legally adequate reasons exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>* Background</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>The Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As is well known, the unlawful-drug-trafficking statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841, forbids, among other things, the distribution, dispensing, or possession with intent to distribute of highly addictive \"Schedule II\" drugs.  Other less well-known statutes apply to pharmacists, requiring that they maintain inventory records, dispense drugs only in pursuance of proper prescriptions, and keep copies of all such prescriptions, duly canceled to prevent unauthorized reuse.  See 21 U.S.C. Secs. 827-830.  What we have called the unlawful-drug-prescribing statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 843, makes it a crime, among other things, to violate certain of these recordkeeping requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the government charged the defendants both with violating the unlawful-drug-prescribing statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 843, and with conspiring to violate the unlawful-drug-trafficking statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841.  It introduced evidence that, in essence, showed the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>1.  In 1988 and again in 1989, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents found that Limby's Pharmacy in Lowell, Massachusetts had not kept inventory records of its addictive drugs.  The agents seized a group of Limby's canceled prescriptions (written between 1986 and 1988) and concluded that they were fraudulent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>2. Seven physicians testified that they had not signed their names to particular prescriptions, as the pharmacy's records indicated.  Some of these witnesses pointed out that the prescriptions bore signatures or customer names that seemed not only false, but obviously so, as, for example, the customer name \"Tin Can\" on a prescription form falsely bearing the name of a Vietnamese physician.  An eighth doctor had died before the time of the purported issuance of prescriptions bearing his name.  Five of the \"recipients\" listed on the prescriptions, according to their own testimony or that of their relatives, had not requested, or received, the drugs purportedly prescribed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>3. A drug addict testified that he had often bought addictive drugs at Limby's, without prescription, between 1986 and 1987.  He added that Limby's clerk, from whom he bought the drugs, told him not to worry about the fact that Nicholas Limberopoulos knew that the clerk was selling him addictive drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of this, and related, evidence, the jury convicted Nicholas Limberopoulos, who owned Limby's Pharmacy and worked there occasionally, of writing 13 false prescriptions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 843(a)(4)(A).  It convicted his son, William, who worked at Limby's regularly, of writing 39 other false prescriptions.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>   It convicted </span>William, but acquitted Nicholas, of using false DEA numbers.  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 843(a)(2).  And it convicted both defendants of conspiring to distribute addictive drugs to others.  See 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841, 846.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <p>Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court first calculated the GSRs, properly using the June 15, 1988 version of the guidelines (to which we shall refer throughout).  The court referred to the guideline applicable to a conspiracy to dispense Schedule II drugs unlawfully, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.4 &amp; App.  A.19, as that guideline instructs, found the weight of the various pills involved, and converted these weights into an equivalent weight in heroin.  The court did so by aggregating the weight of all the pills listed on the false prescriptions underlying the substantive counts on which either Nicholas or William had been convicted (as well as a few other pills listed on a small group of related prescriptions).  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(2) &amp; comment.  (2).  For example, the jury found Nicholas responsible for 13 false prescriptions, which, taken together, accounted for the dispensing of 275 grams of Percocet and 392.7 grams of Valium.  The jury found William responsible for 92 violations concerning false prescriptions and DEA numbers, which, taken together, involved 2145 grams of Percocet, 1720 grams of Percodan, and 50.5 grams of Valium.  The guidelines specified that these amounts (plus the weight of the few additional related pills) should be treated as the equivalent of between 3 and 9.9 kilograms of heroin, yielding a base offense level of 34.  The court added two more levels for each defendant's \"abuse of a position of trust,\" U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.3, and it added two further levels for Nicholas's \"obstruction of justice.\"   <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Sec. 3C1.1. </span> The result--level 38 for Nicholas and level 36 for William--produced GSRs for these two first-time offenders of 235-293 months for Nicholas and 188-235 months for William.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court then departed downward from the GSRs because it believed that the defendants' conduct amounted, not to unlawful drug trafficking, but, rather, to the kind of \"regulatory\" offense forbidden by the unlawful-drug-prescribing statute, with its maximum penalty of 48 months in prison.  The court wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>[I]t is the case here that the object of the conspiracy charged, the charged part of the conspiracy, is dispensing drugs pursuant to prescriptions not issued for [a] legitimate medical purpose.  That is also the essence of the substantive offenses charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>Under these circumstances, the mechanical application of [the] guidelines with respect to count 1 [drug trafficking] significantly, significantly, overstates the seriousness of the predicate and substantive offenses.  This case is not a typical drug conspiracy case.  Indeed, all of the substantive offenses are violations of a regulatory statute [21 U.S.C. Sec. 843], and Congress's intent with respect thereto was, in this case, overridden by the use of sections 846 [the conspiracy statute] and 841 [the drug trafficking statute]....  Accordingly, I shall depart for the reasons I have just mentioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This said, the court imposed a 36-month prison term on Nicholas and a 30-month prison term on William.  The government and the defendants now cross-appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>The Government's Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government appeals the court's decision to depart downward.  It acknowledges that the district court has broad power to depart from a properly calculated sentencing range in an unusual case--a case that lies outside the \"heartland\" of the base guideline that would otherwise apply.

Sec. 3553(c)(2);  and the government asks this court to review the legal adequacy of those reasons, as well as the reasonableness of the result.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rivera,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">950-52</span></a></span>;  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522865\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Diaz-Villafane,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/522865/united-states-v-wilfredo-diaz-villafane/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>;  see also 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(e)(3).  In particular, the government urges us to find that the district court's reason for departing reflects a misunderstanding of the basic aim that animates the unlawful-drug-prescribing statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's reason for departing here is its professed belief that defendants' conduct fell outside the \"heartland\" of the strict unlawful-drug-trafficking statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841, but within the \"heartland\" of the more lenient unlawful-drug-prescribing statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 843.  That is to say, the court thought that the offenders' conduct, while technically falling within a specific statute and guideline, in reality more closely resembled conduct forbidden by a different statute and guideline (as, for example, a technical tax law conviction might involve conduct more appropriately described as \"insider trading\").  And, for that reason, it concluded that departure was appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court misunderstood the relationship between the two relevant statutes--the unlawful-drug-trafficking statute, section 841, and the unlawful-drug-prescribing statute, section 843--and therefore, misapplied its theory of departure here.  The court seemed to think that the former statute primarily targets non-pharmacists (those, say, who sell illegal drugs on the street), while the latter primarily targets pharmacists selling drugs unlawfully without prescriptions in their shops.  For that reason, it felt that the defendants' conduct more appropriately fell within the \"heartland\" of section 843, not section 841.  Our examination of the history and use of the two statutes, however, indicates that they basically make a different distinction--a distinction between unlawful drug distribution on one hand, and unlawful record-keeping on the other hand.  Here, moreover, the defendants' conduct seems to involve the former considerably more than the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin the process of adding flesh to this barebones legal conclusion about the interrelationship of the two statutes by remarking the obvious:  the unlawful-drug-trafficking statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841, does not exempt pharmacists who sell narcotic drugs without prescriptions, nor does it suggest that their conduct is somehow less seriously wrong than the conduct of non-pharmacist drug dealers.  On the contrary, the statute applies to the two groups' conduct in the same way.  The statute's language simply makes it a crime \"knowingly or intentionally\" to \"distribute or dispense\" narcotic drugs.  And this language is reinforced by well-established case law making clear that the statute applies to a pharmacist's (or physician's) drug-dispensing activities so long as they fall outside the usual course of professional practice.

But if the drug-dispensing pharmacist knows that a customer not only lacks a valid prescription but also will not use the drugs for legitimate medical purposes, then section 841 applies in full flower and treats the dispenser like a pusher.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109337\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Moore,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/109337/united-states-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">142-43</span></a></span>, 96 S.Ct. at 345-46.   Indeed, it is difficult to find a relevant difference between a pharmacist who, without proper prescriptions, knowingly supplies a drug addict or trafficker with narcotics, and any other drug dealer who does the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another line of reasoning leads to the same conclusion.  The unlawful-drug-prescribing statute, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 843, is aimed for the most part at a pharmacist's knowing failure to use and maintain proper prescription forms, registration numbers, and kindred records.  Such a failure might, or might not, come accompanied with the pharmacist's knowing sale of narcotics to addicts or traffickers.  The pharmacist, for example, simply might have failed to report his drug supply properly, see, e.g., United States v. Sterber, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506056\"><a href=\"/opinion/506056/united-states-v-gary-sterber/\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">842</span> </a></span>(2d Cir.1988);  or he might have acquired the narcotics improperly, see, e.g., United States v. Pastor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"346866\"><a href=\"/opinion/346866/united-states-v-edward-pastor-and-martin-weiner/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">930</span> </a></span>(2d Cir.1977);  or, he might have used an expired DEA registration number in filling a prescription for a customer whom he believed legitimately needed the drugs for medicinal purposes, see, e.g., United States v. Carranza, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2260210\"><a href=\"/opinion/2260210/united-states-v-carranza/\"><span class=\"volume\">632</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1030</span> </a></span>(S.D.N.Y.1986).  The provision's legislative history indicates that Congress intended it chiefly to address a threat to the integrity of the regulatory system, i.e., the system for administrative control of the legitimate drug industry.  See 116 Cong.  Rec. 996-98 (1970) (statements of Sen.  Dodd and Sen.

The statute's comparatively low maximum penalty provision suggests the same.  Compare 21 U.S.C.

The court instructed the jury that it could acquit the defendants if it found that they had acted in \"good faith,\" but the jury declined to do so;  it thereby accepted the government's claims that the defendants acted with knowledge and evil intent.  For this reason, one cannot easily characterize their conduct as involving, simply or only, the kind of recordkeeping violations at which section 843 seems basically aimed, and which appear to provide the rationale for its 48-month ceiling on imprisonment.  Thus, the district court's view that the defendants' conduct fell within the \"heartland\" of section 843, but not of section 841, reflects a misunderstanding of the basic objectives of the two statutes and their interplay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  That being so, we must set aside the defendants' sentences and return the case for resentencing.

The guideline applicable to drug trafficking conspiracies<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> relates base offense levels to the amount of \"heroin-equivalent\" drug involved in the conspiracy.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1 (Drug Quantity Table).  The amount of heroin-equivalent drug depends upon the total weight of the Percodan, Percocet, and other pills, which is then converted into heroin equivalents.  See, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> comment.  (n. </a></span>10) (Drug Equivalency Table).  Recognizing that, in this instance, the total weight of the pills depends upon the total number of pills for which each defendant is responsible, Nicholas Limberopoulos argues that the district court wrongly attributed to him pills for which William, not he, should have been held accountable.  He rests this conclusion on the premise that the jury might have thought that he was involved in a conspiracy not with William, but with others;  and that, if the jury did think so, it would also have thought that William's pills had nothing to do with the conspiracy underbracing Nicholas's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with this thesis is that the guidelines normally leave to the sentencing judge, not the jury, the determination of the \"conduct\" that is \"relevant\" to sentencing. See U.S.S.G. Sec. 6A1.3.  Nothing the jury decided prevented the judge from finding a conspiracy between Nicholas and William.  Furthermore, the evidence to support a finding of such a conspiracy, whether by judge or jury, is ample.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence showed, for example, that Nicholas owned Limby's Pharmacy.  He worked there on weekends and some weekdays.  William, his son, worked there most weekdays and occasionally on weekends.  The only other employee involved in drug-dispensing was a clerk.  The unlawful sales involved a large number of pills and took place at frequent intervals over a period of two years.  The clerk told a drug-addict customer (who had obvious physical symptoms of drug withdrawal) that it did not matter if Nicholas knew that the clerk was selling drugs to the addict without a proper prescription.  From this evidence the court (and the jury, too) might reasonably have concluded that Nicholas and William each knew the other was dispensing drugs unlawfully, and that each agreed to help the other do so through the ownership and operation of the pharmacy, the maintenance of false records, and the like.  Such an implicit agreement amounts to a conspiracy.  See, e.g., Direct Sales Co. v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103872\"><a href=\"/opinion/103872/direct-sales-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span>, 714, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103872\"><a href=\"/opinion/103872/direct-sales-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1674</span> </a></span>(1943).  The court, therefore, could reasonably attribute to Nicholas the pills that William sold, having found them to be \"part of the same ... common scheme or plan.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(2).  By like token, the court could attribute to Nicholas pills that William improperly dispensed prior to February 10, 1987 (the earliest date of a prescription that Nicholas canceled).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Weight.   Nicholas also argues that the court erred in calculating drug weight by, in effect, weighing the entire pill, and, thus, counting the weight of both narcotic and nonnarcotic ingredients (increasing the weight, say, of a single Percocet pill from roughly five one-thousandths to five-tenths of a gram).  In doing so, however, the court simply followed the instructions of the Sentencing Commission, which tells judges that the</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>scale amounts for all controlled substances refer to the total weight of the controlled substance.  Consistent with the provisions of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, if any mixture of a compound contains any detectable amount of a controlled substance, the entire amount of the mixture or compound shall be considered in measuring the quantity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G.

The remaining portions of that testimony suggest that some of the false prescriptions may have been in William's handwriting, but they add little to other evidence on this point.  Similarly, Nicholas's exculpatory statements to his lawyer and his surrender of Limby's license do not directly show William's guilt.  Rather, their relevance in this respect requires a considerable chain of subsidiary inferences (i.e., that the exculpatory statement was an obvious attempt at deceit and coverup, or the surrender of the license a kind of confession, both showing Nicholas's consciousness of his own guilt, which knowledge, through association, implies William's guilt as well).  Such out-of-court statements neither name nor impugn William directly, and thus cannot be supposed to have implanted in the jurors' minds the kinds of powerfully incriminating impressions against which Bruton protects.  See Richardson v. Marsh, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111865\"><a href=\"/opinion/111865/richardson-v-marsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 208-11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111865\"><a href=\"/opinion/111865/richardson-v-marsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Again, in context, this out-of-court evidence is weak, adding little, if anything, to the weight of the remaining evidence.  Nor can we find anything else about the admission of this evidence that deprived William of a fair trial, \"resulting in a miscarriage of justice.\"  United States v. McLaughlin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578198\"><a href=\"/opinion/578198/united-states-v-bernard-michael-mclaughlin-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.1992) (citation omitted).

Sec. 3552(c).  That provision, however, says that a district court \"may\" order a psychological examination of the defendant if it \"desires more information than is otherwise available to it as a basis for determining the mental condition of the defendant.\"   <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578198\"><a href=\"/opinion/578198/united-states-v-bernard-michael-mclaughlin-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (emphasis supplied). </a></span> In this case, the court was keenly aware of William's psychological difficulties.  The records he placed before the district judge showed a history of drug and alcohol abuse as well as personality disorders, such as narcissism.  The judge could reasonably have concluded that the first set of matters was not directly related to the sentencing decision, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 5H1.4, p.s., while a mental examination would add little or nothing of value to what it already knew about the second.  In our view, the court did not exceed its discretionary authority to decide not to order the examination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Though the combination comprises a bitter pill, defendants' convictions appear lawful, but their reduced sentences appear to have been inappropriately conceived.

There, the district court, confronted with bookmakers who had laundered gambling proceeds and who stood convicted of violating, inter alia, 18 U.S.C. Secs. 1956-1957 (proscribing \"structuring\" of certain monetary transactions), departed downward to make the sentences commensurate with the relatively modest GSR that customarily characterized gambling offenses (rather than the relatively steep GSR that customarily characterized money laundering offenses).  The court premised the departure on the ground that the money laundering offenses \"stem[med] from the prior specified unlawful activity of operating an illegal gambling business,\" and, therefore, fell \"outside ... the 'heartland' of the money laundering guidelines.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670485\"><a href=\"/opinion/670485/united-states-v-telex-leblanc-united-states-of-america-v-telex-j/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 345. </a></span>  We reversed, holding that, since the proscribed conduct \"not only comes within the plain meaning of [the anti-structuring statute], but also was within the full contemplation of Congress when it enacted that statute,\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670485\"><a href=\"/opinion/670485/united-states-v-telex-leblanc-united-states-of-america-v-telex-j/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 347, </a></span>the court's stated ground of departure could not be upheld, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670485\"><a href=\"/opinion/670485/united-states-v-telex-leblanc-united-states-of-america-v-telex-j/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 347-48. </a></span>  So it is here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Technically, there are two statutes involved in the count of conviction here.  21 U.S.C.
