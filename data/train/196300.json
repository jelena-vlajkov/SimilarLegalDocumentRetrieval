On April  28, 1993,  a final  judgment in\r                            \r\n\nfavor  of Yale Materials  Handling Corporation  (\"Yale\"), was\r\n\nentered  in  the  federal  district court  for  the  Southern\r\n\nDistrict of  Florida against  General Trading, Inc.  and Jose\r\n\nBaeza.  On Yale's motion, this judgment was registered in the\r\n\nDistrict of Puerto  Rico on  December 8, 1993.   The  Florida\r\n\ndistrict  court subsequently  appointed James  S. Feltman  as\r\n\npermanent receiver  and authorized him to  take possession of\r\n\nand conserve the property  of General Trading, Inc. and  Jose\r\n\nBaeza in order to satisfy the judgment.\r\n\n     On December  13, 1994,  Feltman filed an  \"Urgent Motion\r\n\nAuthorizing  Receiver to  Take  Possession of  Asset\" in  the\r\n\nPuerto Rico federal district  court, seeking authorization to\r\n\nseize a yacht in  the possession of Baeza's son,  Jose Baeza,\r\n\nJr.   The district court granted Feltman's motion on the same\r\n\nday.  After  discovering that  the yacht had  been moved  and\r\n\napparently renamed,  Feltman filed a  second \"Urgent  Motion\"\r\n\nrequesting  authorization to  seize the  re-described vessel.\r\n\nThe district court granted  the motion on December  16, 1994,\r\n\nand Feltman took possession of the yacht the following day.\r\n\n     On December 29, 1994, Jose  Baeza, Jr. filed a \"Petition\r\n\nto  Enjoin Illegal  Acts and to  Vacate `Order,'\"  seeking in\r\n\nsubstance the  vacation of  the district court's  December 16\r\n\norder.  On January  24, 1995, the district court  denied this\r\n\nmotion.   Baeza,  Jr. filed  a second  motion on  February 7,\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\n1995, captioned  \"Motion to Reconsider and  to Enjoin Further\r\n\nActs,\"  in which  he  sought reconsideration  of the  court's\r\n\nJanuary 24  denial of  his first  motion and  again requested\r\n\nvacation of the  December 16  order.  The  court denied  this\r\n\nsecond  motion on February 22,  1995, and Baeza,  Jr. filed a\r\n\nnotice of appeal on February 27, 1995, challenging the denial\r\n\nof both of his motions.\r\n\n     Despite their labels, neither of  Baeza's motions sought\r\n\ninjunctive  relief.  Substance  controls the determination of\r\n\nwhether an order  is injunctive  for the  purposes of  appeal\r\n\nunder 28 U.S.C.   1292(a)(1).  Sierra Club v. Marsh, 907 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n210, 213 (1st Cir. 1990).  Baeza's first motion simply sought\r\n\nthe vacation of the court's December 16 order and amounted to\r\n\na motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 59(e) or  Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n\nRule 60(b).   If an appeal  had been taken within  30 days of\r\n\nits  denial, we  would face  the question  whether  the order\r\n\ndenying the  first  motion was  a \"final\"  decision under  28\r\n\nU.S.C.   1291, which it quite arguably was.\r\n\n     But  no appeal was taken.   Instead, Baeza,  Jr. filed a\r\n\nnew  motion in February 1995  that could extend  the time for\r\n\nappeal only  if it were a Rule 59(e) motion.  Fed. R. App. P.\r\n\n4(a).   It may be  debatable whether  a Rule 59(e)  motion to\r\n\nalter or amend \"a judgment\" can be used to challenge an order\r\n\nauthorizing  a  receiver  to  take  possession  of  property.\r\n\nAssuming it  can be, it is  settled that a Rule  59(e) motion\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nthat merely repeats arguments made in  a motion attacking the\r\n\noriginal  judgment  does  not  extend the  time  for  appeal.\r\n\nCharles L.M. v. Northeast  Independent School Dist., 884 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n869, 870 (5th  Cir. 1989);  Charles v. Daley,  799 F.2d  343,\r                                                        \r\n\n347-48 (7th Cir.  1986).  Nor does a Rule 60(b) motion extend\r\n\nthe time to appeal from the order sought to be reopened.\r\n\n     Here,  the bulk  of  the second  motion merely  restates\r\n\narguments  made in  the  first motion;  the balance  contains\r\n\nnothing  of importance that could not have been argued in the\r\n\nfirst motion.  In these circumstances,  the February 7 motion\r\n\ndid not  toll the time for  appeal.  That in  turn means that\r\n\nthe time  for appeal is to  be computed from the  date of the\r\n\ndenial  of the first motion on January 24, 1995.  Appellants'\r\n\nnotice of appeal was filed on February 27, 1995, more than 30\r\n\ndays later.  The appeal was therefore untimely.\r\n\n     The appeal is dismissed.\r                                        \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n",
