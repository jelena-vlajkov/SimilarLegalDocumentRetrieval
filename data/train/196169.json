Plaintiff-appellant,  Roy  A.  Day,\r                                 \r\n\nappeals pro  se from  the district court's  dismissal of  his\r                           \r\n\ncomplaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to\r\n\nFed. R. Civ. P.  12(b)(1).  Appellees have moved  for summary\r\n\naffirmance.    Day  has  moved  for  summary  reversal.    We\r\n\nsummarily affirm the dismissal of this complaint.\r\n\n                  I.  Diversity Jurisdiction\r                                                        \r\n\n          \"Once challenged,  .  . .  , the  party seeking  to\r\n\ninvoke   jurisdiction  has  the   burden  of   alleging  with\r\n\nsufficient particularity the facts  indicating that it is not\r\n\na legal  certainty  that the  claim  involves less  than  the\r\n\njurisdictional  amount.   A  party may  meet  this burden  by\r\n\namending   the  pleadings   or  by   submitting  affidavits.\"\r\n\nDepartment of Recreation &amp; Sports  v. World Boxing Ass'n, 942\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 84, 88 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\n\n          Day  has failed  to meet  his burden.   He  did not\r\n\namend  the  pleadings or  submit  affidavits  in response  to\r\n\nappellees' motion  to dismiss.  Although  the complaint seeks\r\n\n$180,000 in compensatory damages,  the entire purchase  price\r\n\nof  the computer  was only  $2,385.   Therefore, even  if the\r\n\ninability to purchase additional memory rendered the computer\r\n\ncompletely  useless  (which  Day  admits  it  did  not),  the\r\n\ncompensatory  damages  would  not  approach  $50,000.     The\r\n\ncomplaint does not allege lost profits or other consequential\r\n\nbusiness losses.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          Whether  Massachusetts or  Florida law  controls (a\r\n\nmatter about which the  parties disagree), damages for mental\r\n\npain and  suffering and punitive damages  are not recoverable\r\n\non these facts.   Therefore,  Day has failed  to plead  facts\r\n\nindicating that it is  not a legal certainty that  his claims\r\n\ninvolve less than $50,000.\r\n\n              II.  Federal Question Jurisdiction\r                                                            \r\n\n          Defendant's motion to dismiss was  pursuant to both\r\n\nFed.  R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1)  and 12(b)(6).   The district court\r\n\ndismissed the complaint pursuant to 12(b)(1).   Day argues on\r\n\nappeal  that the  adequacy  of the  jurisdictional amount  is\r\n\n\"moot\"  because the  complaint arises  under the  Sherman and\r\n\nClayton Acts  and that, therefore, there  is federal question\r\n\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   1331.  We may affirm the\r\n\ndistrict  court's  12(b)(1)  dismissal on  any  independently\r\n\nsufficient ground,  including failure  to state a  claim. See\r                                                                         \r\n\nWatterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 7 n.3 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                             \r\n\n          The  basis of  Day's claims  under the  Sherman and\r\n\nClayton  Acts is  that  defendants engaged  in the  following\r\n\n\"monopolistic practices\": \r\n\n          deny[ing]  .  .  .   citizens  additional\r\n          `random accessory memory'  . . .  for NEC\r\n          computers at a reasonable and competitive\r\n          purchase price, solely for the purpose to\r\n          force, coerce and intimidate the citizens\r\n          to purchase a `new NEC computer' by using\r                                                     \r\n          correspondence  which   is  replete  with\r\n          `falsehoods,   fraud,  misrepresentations\r\n          and half-truths,'. . . .\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nAs the appellees point out in their Opposition to Appellant's\r\n\nMotion for Summary Reversal, the claim is illogical:  \"[W]ith\r\n\nsuch a range of  alternative[] [lap top computers] available,\r\n\nappellant's  dissatisfaction with  the cost of  enhancing the\r\n\nmemory  on his NEC machine  would result in  his purchasing a\r\n\ncompetitor's product, rather than being forced to buy another\r\n\nproduct from NEC.\"  \r\n\n          The complaint  alleges  that NEC  sells  additional\r\n\nmemory  for  the  286V  at  unreasonable  and  noncompetitive\r\n\nprices.    It also  alleges, however,  that  NEC --  far from\r\n\nhaving a monopoly  in the  supply of additional  RAM for  the\r\n\n286V -- does not have the  RAM for sale at all.  The  alleged\r\n\n\"monopolistic practices\" could not  even conceivably have the\r\n\neffect  of restraining  competition or  creating a  monopoly.\r\n\nThe complaint's vague  and contradictory allegations fail  to\r\n\nstate a claim under the federal antitrust laws.\r\n\n          Accordingly, the district court's dismissal of this\r\n\ncomplaint is affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.  Appellees' request\r                                       \r\n\nfor an injunction restricting Day's filings with the district\r\n\ncourt  is denied.    Appellees may  file  a motion  with  the\r                            \r\n\ndistrict court  seeking an injunction from  future filings if\r\n\nthe need arises.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
