McCloskey,  United States Attorney, and Michael M.  DuBose,\n                                                                 \nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n     Per Curiam.   Oscar Andiarena  was convicted in  1985 of\n               \n\nconspiracy to  possess cocaine with intent  to distribute, in\n\nviolation  of  21  U.S.C.     846.    See  United  States  v.\n                                                         \n\nAndiarena, 823 F.2d 673 (1st Cir. 1987) (affirming conviction\n         \n\non direct  appeal).  He thereafter filed  two petitions under\n\n28 U.S.C.    2255 to vacate his conviction, each of which was\n\ndenied.   See Andiarena v.  United States, 940  F.2d 646 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir. 1991) (per curiam) (table) (affirming denial on merits);\n\nAndiarena v. United States, 967 F.2d 715 (1st Cir. 1992) (per\n                          \n\ncuriam) (affirming denial as  abuse of writ).  Andiarena  now\n\nappeals  from the  denial of  his third    2255  petition, in\n\nwhich he alleged that the district court lacked  jurisdiction\n\nover the  underlying criminal offense.   Because the district\n\ncourt disposed of the instant petition on the merits  (rather\n\nthan on abuse of the writ grounds), we shall do likewise.\n\n     Petitioner advances  two arguments in this  regard, both\n\nof which  prove frivolous.   He  first contends that  federal\n\ndistrict   courts  are  without   jurisdiction  to  entertain\n\nprosecutions  brought  under 21  U.S.C.     846 because  that\n\nstatutory provision contains  no such grant  of jurisdiction.\n\nThis argument  ignores the  fact  that district  courts  have\n\noriginal jurisdiction over offenses against the United States\n\nunder  18  U.S.C.    3231.    Second, petitioner  inventively\n\nsuggests that Title 21 was never officially enacted into law.\n\nIn support, he notes that Title  21 has yet to be included in\n\nthe ongoing effort  to revise and  codify the Code's  various\n\ntitles  so as to  make them official  statements (rather than\n\nsimply  prima  facie  evidence) of  the  federal  laws.   See\n                                                             \n\nPreface to U.S.C.  (1982).   This argument  ignores the  fact\n\nthat 21 U.S.C.   846 was enacted into law on October 27, 1970\n\nby Pub. L. No.  91-513, Tit. II,    406, 84 Stat. 1265.   For\n\nthese reasons,  the district  court was plainly  justified in\n\ndenying the petition  on its  face without a  hearing.   See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., Shraiar v.
