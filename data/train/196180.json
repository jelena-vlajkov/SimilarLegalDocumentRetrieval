STATEMENT OF FACTS\r\n\n          On September 22, 1990, Aguilar-Aranceta went to pick up\r\n\ntwo  parcels at  the United States  Post Office in  Old San Juan,\r\n\nPuerto Rico.   Two yellow  slips had  been left in  her mail  box\r\n\nprior to that date  notifying her that there were  two registered\r\n\nparcels  addressed to  her  at the  post  office.1     Addressing\r\n\nAguilar-Aranceta in English, the window  clerk at the post office\r\n\ncounter  asked for identification to verify  the signature on the\r\n\ntwo  slips.  Aguilar-Aranceta responded by immediately retrieving\r\n\na  Puerto Rican driver's license from her purse.  After verifying\r\n\nthe signatures,  the window clerk  brought her two  packages with\r\n\nreturn  addresses from  Medell n, Colombia.   Both  packages were\r\n\naddressed  to Esperanza  Aguilar, P.O.  Box 5739.   Box  5739 was\r\n\nrented to  Aguilar-Aranceta.   Aguilar-Aranceta  pointed  at  the\r\n\nreturn addresses on the packages and stated \"no me (sic) family,\"\r\n\nto  which the  attendant replied  that it  was up  to her  if she\r\n\nwanted to take  them or not.  The window  clerk left the packages\r\n\non the counter  and once again  the defendant  said \"no me  (sic)\r\n\nfamily,\" and once again the  clerk replied that it was up  to her\r\n\nif she wanted  to take them or not.   Defendant then proceeded to\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   These yellow  slips were  the second set  of slips  placed in\r\ndefendant's mail box.  The first set of slips were recovered from\r\ndefendant's purse after her arrest.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\ntake the two packages.  Immediately upon exiting the lobby of the\r\n\nPost  Office defendant was detained and placed under arrest.  The\r\n\ntwo  packages she  was carrying  had been  intercepted by  a mail\r\n\nspecialist earlier  and found to contain  approximately 224 grams\r\n\nof cocaine.  Aguilar-Aranceta never opened the packages.\r\n\n          On September  26, 1990,  a federal  grand  jury in  San\r\n\nJuan,  Puerto  Rico,  returned  a two  count  indictment  against\r\n\ndefendant, charging her with unlawful possession of approximately\r\n\n224  grams of cocaine with the intent to distribute, in violation\r\n\nof 21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1) (count one); and with importation of the\r\n\nsame cocaine  to the  United States  from Medell n,  Colombia, in\r\n\nviolation of  21 U.S.C.    952(a) (count two).   Aguilar-Aranceta\r\n\nentered pleas of not guilty as to both counts.  The jury returned\r\n\na  verdict of not  guilty as  to the  importation count,  but was\r\n\nunable  to reach  a unanimous  verdict as  to the  count alleging\r\n\npossession  with  intent  to  distribute.    The  district  court\r\n\ndeclared  a mistrial as to count one and subsequently granted the\r\n\ngovernment's request for a new trial.2\r\n\n          After  a  second  jury  trial in  June  1993,  Aguilar-\r\n\nAranceta was convicted for possession  of cocaine with the intent\r\n\nto distribute.  Aguilar-Aranceta now appeals.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   On March 18, 1991, defendant  filed a motion to dismiss count\r\none on the grounds  that a second prosecution would  constitute a\r\nviolation of  her fifth amendment  right not  to be twice  put in\r\njeopardy  for the same conduct.   The district  court denied this\r\nmotion, a ruling  we affirmed on  appeal.  See  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\nAguilar-Aranceta,  957 F.2d 18  (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 113 S.\r                                                                   \r\nCt. 105 (1992).  \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n                         II.  DISCUSSION\r                                   II.  DISCUSSION\r\n\n          To  convict   Aguilar-Aranceta   under  21   U.S.C.    \r\n\n841(a)(1),  the   government  was  required  to   show  beyond  a\r\n\nreasonable  doubt  that  she  knowingly  possessed  a  controlled\r\n\nsubstance with  the  intent to  distribute.3   United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nBergodere, 40 F.3d 512, 518 (1st Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S.\r                                                                   \r\n\nCt. 1439  (1995).   The government presented  evidence concerning\r\n\nAguilar-Aranceta's  prior conviction  for possession  of cocaine.\r\n\nThe  district court  admitted this  evidence as  relevant to  the\r\n\nissue of  whether Aguilar-Aranceta  was in knowing  possession of\r                                                            \r\n\ncocaine when  she was arrested at the Old San Juan Post Office in\r\n\n1990.  Aguilar-Aranceta contends  that all evidence pertaining to\r\n\nher prior conviction  serves no other purpose than to demonstrate\r\n\na propensity for criminal activity and should therefore have been\r\n\nexcluded under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).\r\n\n          A.

It may, however, be\r\n            admissible  for  other purposes,  such as\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nSee, e.g., United States v.

Garc a, 983  F.2d 1160, 1172  (1st Cir.  1992);\r                                  \r\n\nUnited States v. Moccia, 681  F.2d 61, 63 (1st Cir. 1982).   That\r                                 \r\n\nis, the  judge  must  determine  whether the  evidence  has  some\r\n\n\"special\" probative  value.  United States  v.

Prior bad acts may be \"specially\r\n\nrelevant\" if  they are probative of  motive, opportunity, intent,\r\n\npreparation, plan, knowledge, identity,  or absence of mistake or\r\n\naccident.   See, e.g., Guyon, 27 F.3d at 728; Garc a, 983 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n1172.\r\n\n          If the  judge is satisfied that  the proffered evidence\r\n\nhas \"special relevance,\" the  focus shifts to the second  part of\r\n\nthe  test,  which  applies  Rule  403  to  determine whether  the\r\n\nprobative value  of the evidence is  \"substantially outweighed by\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n            proof  of  motive,  opportunity,  intent,\r\n            preparation,  plan, knowledge,  identity,\r\n            or absence of mistake or accident . . . .\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nthe danger of  unfair prejudice.\"5  Fed.

Although the  law\r\n\nregarding  prior  bad  acts  as  evidence  of  knowledge is  well\r\n\nsettled, it is complex and merits some discussion.\r\n\n          In   prosecutions   for  \"possession\"   offenses,6  the\r\n\ncentral  issue is  often  whether the  defendant  was in  knowing\r                                                                           \r\n\npossession.  The  knowledge element  is difficult  to prove,  and\r\n\ndefendants  commonly  claim   that  they  were  merely   innocent\r\n\nbystanders  or unwitting  participants.   Where  the evidence  is\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5  Fed. R. Evid. 403 states:\r\n\n            Although   relevant,   evidence  may   be\r\n            excluded  if  its   probative  value   is\r\n            substantially outweighed by the danger of\r\n            unfair   prejudice,   confusion  of   the\r\n            issues,  or misleading  the  jury, or  by\r\n            considerations of undue  delay, waste  of\r\n            time,   or   needless   presentation   of\r\n            cumulative evidence.\r\n\n6    Possession  offenses  include,  inter  alia,  possession  of\r                                                          \r\nnarcotics, possession  of stolen merchandise,  and possession  of\r\nfirearms.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nsusceptible  to   the  explanation  that  the   acts  alleged  to\r\n\nconstitute the  crime were  innocently performed and  the crucial\r\n\nissues  of intent and knowledge are keenly disputed, we have held\r\n\nthat it is within the judge's discretion to permit the government\r\n\nto introduce  evidence of  prior similar offenses  to demonstrate\r\n\nthe unlikeliness  that the defendant  was merely an  innocent and\r\n\nunknowing bystander.  For  example, in United States  v. Spinosa,\r                                                                          \r\n\n982  F.2d 620 (1st Cir.  1992), we held  that evidence concerning\r\n\nthe  defendant's history  of cocaine  possession and  dealing was\r\n\nprobative of  his knowledge and intent to  participate in cocaine\r\n\ntransaction charged because it directly contradicted  his defense\r\n\nthat he was involved only by accident or mistake.  \r\n\n          The justification often advanced for admitting evidence\r\n\nof other crimes to prove knowledge is that no inference as to the\r\n\ndefendant's character  is required.  See United States v. Ferrer-\r                                                                           \r\n\nCruz,  899 F.2d 135, 138 (1st Cir.  1990); see also 22 Charles A.\r                                                             \r\n\nWright  &amp; Kenneth A.

We consider the following example illustrative\r\n\nof the permissible inferential chain:\r\n\n            The  fact  that   an  illegal  alien  was\r\n            previously  found  stowed away  under the\r\n            hood  of defendant's  car does  not prove\r\n            that a  second alien found  there did not\r\n            creep in  undetected  while the  car  was\r\n            parked.  However,  it does seem  unlikely\r\n            that  the  same  person  could  be  twice\r\n            victimized in  this fashion, particularly\r\n            when   a   reasonable   person  who   had\r\n            previously  gotten  into trouble  in this\r\n            way would probably take care to see  that\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n            he  had only  an  engine  under the  hood\r\n            before heading for the border.\r\n\n22 Wright  &amp; Graham, supra,    5245.  Along these  lines, we also\r                                    \r\n\nhave explained that jurors might permissibly hypothecate that the\r\n\ndefendant's  repetitive   involvement  in  criminal   conduct  is\r\n\nunlikely to have left her oblivious to  the true character of the\r\n\nacts  in question.    See, e.g.,  Ferrer-Cruz,  899 F.2d  at  138\r                                                       \r\n\n(noting that \"[s]ince one who has previous experience  with drugs\r\n\nis more  likely  to see  'car  switching' as  part of  drug  sale\r\n\ntechnique  than  one  who has  no  such  experience,  . .  .  the\r\n\ninferences at  issue do not involve character\"); United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nSimon,  842 F.2d 552 (1st Cir. 1988); United States v.

It is impermissible to suggest that a defendant's\r\n\nprior conviction for possession of cocaine somehow makes her more\r                                                                           \r\n\nlikely to  have acted in a  similar manner in the  context of the\r                \r\n\npresent  possession charges.    Similarly, a  prosecutor may  not\r\n\nargue that  the defendant's prior  conviction for a  drug offense\r\n\ndemonstrates her propensity for involvement in drug trafficking.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n          Moving  to   the  present   case,  we  note   that  the\r\n\ncircumstances surrounding Aguilar-Aranceta's 1986  conviction are\r\n\nsimilar to  those of the  present charges in  several significant\r\n\naspects.   We have held that similarity between the prior act and\r\n\nthe current charges is often the predominant factor or touchstone\r\n\nin the  test for special  relevance as to  defendant's knowledge.\r\n\nSee  United   States  v.   Arias-Montoya,  967  F.2d   at  712-13\r                                                  \r\n\n(summarizing  circumstances  which   would  constitute   \"special\r\n\nrelevance,\" including  that prior  bad acts (1)  closely mirrored\r\n\nthe newly  charged crime, (2) were  part of a common  scheme or a\r\n\ncourse of continuous dealing, or (3) provided the context for the\r\n\nnewly charged  crime); see also  United States  v. Hadfield,  918\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d 987, 994  (1st Cir. 1990)  (upholding admission of  evidence\r\n\nconcerning  prior drug  involvement  in a  drug trafficking  case\r\n\nbecause the  past actions  were \"proximate  in  time and  closely\r\n\nallied  with the type of  crimes for which  appellants were being\r\n\ntried\"), cert. denied,  500 U.S.  936 (1991).   Here, both  cases\r                               \r\n\ninvolved  packages containing  cocaine that  had been  shipped to\r\n\nAguilar-Aranceta's  post  office box  at  the Old  San  Juan Post\r\n\nOffice.    In both  instances,  the  packages were  addressed  to\r\n\nAguilar-Aranceta with return addresses  indicating that they  had\r\n\nbeen  sent from Medell n, Colombia.  The cases differ with regard\r\n\nto  the  circumstances  of  arrest.    In 1986,  the  authorities\r\n\nfollowed Aguilar-Aranceta from the  Old San Juan Post Office  and\r\n\narrested  her at her home.  In the present case, Aguilar-Aranceta\r\n\nwas arrested before she  left the Post Office Building.   In both\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\ncases Aguilar-Aranceta had not opened the packages at the time of\r\n\nher arrest.   In the 1986 case, the unopened packages had been in\r\n\nher possession for several hours.\r\n\n          With regard to whether  the prior conviction clears the\r\n\nspecial  relevance  hurdle,  it   is  a  close  call.     We  are\r\n\nparticularly  concerned  with the  four-year  period between  her\r\n\nprior  conviction and the facts leading to the present charges as\r\n\nwell  as the  fact  that  the  packages  were  unopened  in  both\r\n\ninstances.   Nevertheless, we do not find that the district court\r\n\nabused its  discretion in concluding that the  1986 conviction is\r\n\nso similar that it is  relevant to the issue of knowledge  in the\r\n\npresent case.  A  jury could have permissibly made  the following\r\n\ninferential analysis: many people  in the general population have\r\n\nlittle  or no knowledge of how narcotics traffickers use the mail\r\n\nsystem  to ply their trade, and for this reason might unwittingly\r\n\naccept  two packages sent to  them from an  unfamiliar address in\r\n\nMedell n,  Colombia.    Aguilar-Aranceta's  prior  conviction for\r\n\npossession  of cocaine that had been mailed to her from Medell n,\r\n\nColombia suggests that she cannot plausibly make this claim.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited  States  v.  Nickens,  955 F.2d  112,  124-25  (1st  Cir.)\r                                     \r\n\n(holding that  where defendant claimed  to have been  an innocent\r\n\ndupe  with  regard to  cocaine found  in  his luggage,  his prior\r\n\nnarcotics conviction was relevant to issue of knowledge because a\r\n\njury  might permissibly  infer  that someone  who has  experience\r\n\nselling  cocaine  is  more  likely  to know  how  drug  smugglers\r\n\noperate),  cert. denied, 113 S.

Of course, her\r                                 \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nprior  conviction  does  not  conclusively  prove  that  Aguilar-\r\n\nAranceta   knew   that   the   packages   contained   contraband.\r\n\nNevertheless,  we  think that  the  jury  permissibly could  have\r\n\ninferred that  someone  with a  previous  mail-related  narcotics\r\n\nconviction would be reluctant to again accept mysterious packages\r\n\nfrom Colombia, and that  Aguilar-Aranceta's failure to reject the\r\n\npackages given her prior  experiences bears on the  crucial issue\r\n\nof knowledge.  We think that  these inferences might be even more\r\n\nplausible  given that  Aguilar-Aranceta  claims to  have been  an\r\n\nunwitting pawn  in the  events that  led to  her  guilty plea  in\r\n\n1986.7   Accordingly,  we find  that the  district court  did not\r\n\nabuse  its discretion  in  finding that  Aguilar-Aranceta's prior\r\n\nconviction was specially relevant to the issue of knowledge.\r\n\n          C.

The\r\n\ntenets of Rule 403 balancing are familiar and often  quoted:  \"If\r\n\nthe evidence brings unwanted baggage,  say, unfair prejudice or a\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7   Aguilar-Aranceta  testified regarding the  events surrounding\r\nher   1986  conviction.

She testified that when the authorities arrived at her\r\nhome, she gave them  the packages, which were unopened,  and told\r\nthem about Perales.   The authorities waited  for a few hours  to\r\nsee if Perales would arrive,  and when he did not,  they arrested\r\nher.\r\n\n   She testified that she  subsequently pled guilty to possession\r\nof cocaine even though the packages were not hers because she was\r\nin  an advanced state of pregnancy and wanted to avoid jail time.\r\nShe was sentenced to two years probation.  \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\ncognizable  risk  of confusing  the  jury, and  if  the baggage's\r\n\nweight substantially  overbalances any probative value,  then the\r\n\nevidence must be excluded.\"   United States v.

Accordingly, we review  only for  abuse of  discretion.\r\n\nUnited States v. Desmarais, 938 F.2d 347, 351 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                                    \r\n\n          Aguilar-Aranceta argues that  the legitimate  probative\r\n\nvalue of her prior conviction, if any, is completely overshadowed\r\n\nby  the  danger of  unfair  prejudice.    We  agree.   The  prior\r\n\nconviction  is probative  on the  issue of  knowledge only  in an\r\n\nattenuated manner, dependent on the following \"once burned, twice\r\n\nshy\"  chain  of  inferences:   (1)  someone  who  has a  previous\r\n\nconviction  stemming from  the receipt of  cocaine-laden packages\r\n\nwould likely  be reluctant  to innocently and  unwittingly accept\r\n\nmysterious packages from Colombia; and (2) the fact that Aguilar-\r\n\nAranceta  did  in  fact  accept the  packages  despite  her prior\r\n\nconviction  suggests that she knew their contents.  While in some\r\n\ncircumstances this inferential chain might be strongly probative,\r\n\nthe  circumstances here render it  of limited value.    First, we\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nnote  the remoteness  in time  of her  prior conviction.   Common\r\n\nsense  dictates  that the  time  span  between the  events  bears\r\n\ndirectly  on the probative weight of  the prior conviction vis-a-\r\n\nvis  the government's  \"once burned,  twice shy\"  argument.   Cf.\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v. Lynn, 856 F.2d  430 (1st Cir. 1988) (noting that\r                               \r\n\nsix year  period between  the prior  conviction  and the  instant\r\n\noffense significantly diminishes the probative value of the prior\r\n\nconviction).   Second, we  note that  Aguilar-Aranceta apparently\r\n\nspoke little or no English.  She testified that she was expecting\r\n\na  letter from  her sister  and became  confused when  the window\r\n\nclerk produced  packages with  unfamiliar return addresses.   She\r\n\ntestified  further  that  she  eventually  accepted  the packages\r\n\nbecause the window  clerk kept insisting  that the packages  were\r\n\nhers  even  though  she  repeatedly  tried  to explain  that  the\r\n\npackages were  not from  her family.    Third, we  note that  the\r\n\nwindow clerk was aware that Aguilar-Aranceta would be arrested if\r\n\nshe took the  packages, which  suggests that he  might have  been\r\n\nespecially zealous in encouraging  her to take the packages.   We\r\n\nthink these circumstances limit the probative value of the  prior\r\n\nconviction evidence.\r\n\n          Against the  marginal relevance of the prior conviction\r\n\nevidence, we  weigh the  danger that  it unfairly prejudiced  the\r\n\njury.   Here,  we  cannot escape  the  conclusion that  the  most\r\n\npowerful  inference that  the jury  was likely  to make  from the\r\n\nprior conviction is also the forbidden one:  that because she was\r\n\npreviously  convicted under  nearly identical  circumstances, she\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nmust be  guilty here.    The specter  of impermissible  character\r\n\nevidence  is  likely  to   have  significantly  overshadowed  any\r\n\nlegitimate probative value.  We find this especially likely given\r\n\nthat  there  was  virtually  no other  evidence  suggesting  that\r\n\nAguilar-Aranceta was  in knowing possession of  cocaine.  Leaving\r                                          \r\n\naside  her previous  conviction, the  evidence pertaining  to the\r\n\ndefendant's state of mind  was equivocal.  The  government points\r\n\nout that  although  Aguilar-Aranceta was  poor  and was  able  to\r\n\nreceive mail at her  home, she kept a post office  box at the Old\r\n\nSan  Juan  Post  Office.     Nevertheless,  Aguilar-Aranceta  was\r\n\napparently in no hurry to  get the packages.  In fact,  nine days\r\n\npassed between the time the first set of claim slips were  placed\r\n\nin Aguilar-Aranceta's box and the time that Aguilar-Aranceta went\r\n\nto pick up the packages.  Similarly, her  behavior at the counter\r\n\nwas of uncertain significance.  The window clerk could only state\r\n\nthat  since  she  did  not  expressly  refuse  the  packages,  he\r\n\ncontinued to  leave  them  on  the  counter.    The  government's\r\n\nargument  that  Aguilar-Aranceta's  demonstrated  reluctance  was\r\n\nmerely  a smokescreen to conceal her knowledge of the contents of\r\n\nthe packages is dubious, especially in light of the fact that the\r\n\nwindow  clerk could  have taken  back the  packages at  any time.\r\n\nPerhaps because  the government's evidence was  weak with respect\r\n\nto  the  current charges  (particularly  so  because it  arrested\r\n\nAguilar-Aranceta before she had  a chance to open the  packages),\r\n\nit focused the jury's attention on her prior  conviction.  In any\r\n\ncase,  we  think that  the  amount  of  evidence introduced  with\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nrespect  to  her  prior  conviction  dramatically  increased  the\r\n\nlikelihood that the jury  convicted Aguilar-Aranceta on the basis\r\n\nof the 1986 conviction alone rather than on  a fair assessment of\r\n\nthe evidence.\r\n\n          The  gravity  of  the  unfair prejudice  is  even  more\r\n\napparent  when one  considers that  the prior conviction  was not\r\n\nmerely one part of the government's attempt to establish Aguilar-\r\n\nAranceta's state of mind.   It was the entire case.   The offense\r\n\nof possession with intent to distribute cannot be \"established by\r\n\nproof merely  that a  package  containing drugs  was mailed  from\r\n\noutside this country and was received and opened by the addressee\r\n\nof the package  inside this country.  The  threat this would pose\r\n\nto  innocent  victims  of  mere  mistake  or  actual  set-ups  is\r\n\nobvious.\"  United States v. Samad, 754 F.2d  1091, 1096 (4th Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1985).  This logic applies with equal or greater force to someone\r\n\nwith  a  previous  conviction  for  narcotics  trafficking.    In\r\n\nessence,  admitting  Aguilar-Aranceta's prior  conviction allowed\r\n\nthe jury  to convict her upon  facts that would  likely have been\r\n\ninsufficient to convict a  similarly situated defendant without a\r\n\nprior conviction.   In sum,  we think that  evidence of  Aguilar-\r\n\nAranceta's prior conviction should have been excluded because its\r\n\nmarginal probative value, coupled with the scarcity and equivocal\r\n\nnature of  the other evidence relating  to the Aguilar-Aranceta's\r\n\nstate of mind, created  an unacceptable risk that the  jury would\r\n\nassume  that  Aguilar-Aranceta  had  a  propensity for  narcotics\r\n\ntrafficking and convict on that basis alone.\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n          D.

She\r\n\nnow appeals.  For the following reasons, we reverse.\r\n\n                      I.  STATEMENT OF FACTS\r                                I.  STATEMENT OF FACTS\r\n\n          On September 22, 1990, Aguilar-Aranceta went to pick up\r\n\ntwo  parcels at  the United States  Post Office in  Old San Juan,\r\n\nPuerto Rico.   Two yellow  slips had  been left in  her mail  box\r\n\nprior to that date  notifying her that there were  two registered\r\n\nparcels  addressed to  her  at the  post  office.1     Addressing\r\n\nAguilar-Aranceta in English, the window  clerk at the post office\r\n\ncounter  asked for identification to verify  the signature on the\r\n\ntwo  slips.  Aguilar-Aranceta responded by immediately retrieving\r\n\na  Puerto Rican driver's license from her purse.  After verifying\r\n\nthe signatures,  the window clerk  brought her two  packages with\r\n\nreturn  addresses from  Medell n, Colombia.   Both  packages were\r\n\naddressed  to Esperanza  Aguilar, P.O.  Box 5739.   Box  5739 was\r\n\nrented to  Aguilar-Aranceta.   Aguilar-Aranceta  pointed  at  the\r\n\nreturn addresses on the packages and stated \"no me (sic) family,\"\r\n\nto  which the  attendant replied  that it  was up  to her  if she\r\n\nwanted to take  them or not.  The window  clerk left the packages\r\n\non the counter  and once again  the defendant  said \"no me  (sic)\r\n\nfamily,\" and once again the  clerk replied that it was up  to her\r\n\nif she wanted  to take them or not.   Defendant then proceeded to\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   These yellow  slips were  the second set  of slips  placed in\r\ndefendant's mail box.  The first set of slips were recovered from\r\ndefendant's purse after her arrest.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\ntake the two packages.  Immediately upon exiting the lobby of the\r\n\nPost  Office defendant was detained and placed under arrest.  The\r\n\ntwo  packages she  was carrying  had been  intercepted by  a mail\r\n\nspecialist earlier  and found to contain  approximately 224 grams\r\n\nof cocaine.  Aguilar-Aranceta never opened the packages.\r\n\n          On September  26, 1990,  a federal  grand  jury in  San\r\n\nJuan,  Puerto  Rico,  returned  a two  count  indictment  against\r\n\ndefendant, charging her with unlawful possession of approximately\r\n\n224  grams of cocaine with the intent to distribute, in violation\r\n\nof 21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1) (count one); and with importation of the\r\n\nsame cocaine  to the  United States  from Medell n,  Colombia, in\r\n\nviolation of  21 U.S.C.    952(a) (count two).   Aguilar-Aranceta\r\n\nentered pleas of not guilty as to both counts.  The jury returned\r\n\na  verdict of not  guilty as  to the  importation count,  but was\r\n\nunable  to reach  a unanimous  verdict as  to the  count alleging\r\n\npossession  with  intent  to  distribute.    The  district  court\r\n\ndeclared  a mistrial as to count one and subsequently granted the\r\n\ngovernment's request for a new trial.2\r\n\n          After  a  second  jury  trial in  June  1993,  Aguilar-\r\n\nAranceta was convicted for possession  of cocaine with the intent\r\n\nto distribute.  Aguilar-Aranceta now appeals.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   On March 18, 1991, defendant  filed a motion to dismiss count\r\none on the grounds  that a second prosecution would  constitute a\r\nviolation of  her fifth amendment  right not  to be twice  put in\r\njeopardy  for the same conduct.   The district  court denied this\r\nmotion, a ruling  we affirmed on  appeal.

The government presented  evidence concerning\r\n\nAguilar-Aranceta's  prior conviction  for possession  of cocaine.\r\n\nThe  district court  admitted this  evidence as  relevant to  the\r\n\nissue of  whether Aguilar-Aranceta  was in knowing  possession of\r                                                            \r\n\ncocaine when  she was arrested at the Old San Juan Post Office in\r\n\n1990.  Aguilar-Aranceta contends  that all evidence pertaining to\r\n\nher prior conviction  serves no other purpose than to demonstrate\r\n\na propensity for criminal activity and should therefore have been\r\n\nexcluded under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).\r\n\n          A.

Here, both  cases\r                               \r\n\ninvolved  packages containing  cocaine that  had been  shipped to\r\n\nAguilar-Aranceta's  post  office box  at  the Old  San  Juan Post\r\n\nOffice.    In both  instances,  the  packages were  addressed  to\r\n\nAguilar-Aranceta with return addresses  indicating that they  had\r\n\nbeen  sent from Medell n, Colombia.  The cases differ with regard\r\n\nto  the  circumstances  of  arrest.    In 1986,  the  authorities\r\n\nfollowed Aguilar-Aranceta from the  Old San Juan Post Office  and\r\n\narrested  her at her home.  In the present case, Aguilar-Aranceta\r\n\nwas arrested before she  left the Post Office Building.   In both\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\ncases Aguilar-Aranceta had not opened the packages at the time of\r\n\nher arrest.

We  are\r\n\nparticularly  concerned  with the  four-year  period between  her\r\n\nprior  conviction and the facts leading to the present charges as\r\n\nwell  as the  fact  that  the  packages  were  unopened  in  both\r\n\ninstances.   Nevertheless, we do not find that the district court\r\n\nabused its  discretion in concluding that the  1986 conviction is\r\n\nso similar that it is  relevant to the issue of knowledge  in the\r\n\npresent case.  A  jury could have permissibly made  the following\r\n\ninferential analysis: many people  in the general population have\r\n\nlittle  or no knowledge of how narcotics traffickers use the mail\r\n\nsystem  to ply their trade, and for this reason might unwittingly\r\n\naccept  two packages sent to  them from an  unfamiliar address in\r\n\nMedell n,  Colombia.    Aguilar-Aranceta's  prior  conviction for\r\n\npossession  of cocaine that had been mailed to her from Medell n,\r\n\nColombia suggests that she cannot plausibly make this claim.

We  agree.   The  prior\r\n\nconviction  is probative  on the  issue of  knowledge only  in an\r\n\nattenuated manner, dependent on the following \"once burned, twice\r\n\nshy\"  chain  of  inferences:   (1)  someone  who  has a  previous\r\n\nconviction  stemming from  the receipt of  cocaine-laden packages\r\n\nwould likely  be reluctant  to innocently and  unwittingly accept\r\n\nmysterious packages from Colombia; and (2) the fact that Aguilar-\r\n\nAranceta  did  in  fact  accept the  packages  despite  her prior\r\n\nconviction  suggests that she knew their contents.  While in some\r\n\ncircumstances this inferential chain might be strongly probative,\r\n\nthe  circumstances here render it  of limited value.    First, we\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nnote  the remoteness  in time  of her  prior conviction.   Common\r\n\nsense  dictates  that the  time  span  between the  events  bears\r\n\ndirectly  on the probative weight of  the prior conviction vis-a-\r\n\nvis  the government's  \"once burned,  twice shy\"  argument.   Cf.\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v.

Second, we  note that  Aguilar-Aranceta apparently\r\n\nspoke little or no English.  She testified that she was expecting\r\n\na  letter from  her sister  and became  confused when  the window\r\n\nclerk produced  packages with  unfamiliar return addresses.   She\r\n\ntestified  further  that  she  eventually  accepted  the packages\r\n\nbecause the window  clerk kept insisting  that the packages  were\r\n\nhers  even  though  she  repeatedly  tried  to explain  that  the\r\n\npackages were  not from  her family.    Third, we  note that  the\r\n\nwindow clerk was aware that Aguilar-Aranceta would be arrested if\r\n\nshe took the  packages, which  suggests that he  might have  been\r\n\nespecially zealous in encouraging  her to take the packages.   We\r\n\nthink these circumstances limit the probative value of the  prior\r\n\nconviction evidence.\r\n\n          Against the  marginal relevance of the prior conviction\r\n\nevidence, we  weigh the  danger that  it unfairly prejudiced  the\r\n\njury.   Here,  we  cannot escape  the  conclusion that  the  most\r\n\npowerful  inference that  the jury  was likely  to make  from the\r\n\nprior conviction is also the forbidden one:  that because she was\r\n\npreviously  convicted under  nearly identical  circumstances, she\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nmust be  guilty here.    The specter  of impermissible  character\r\n\nevidence  is  likely  to   have  significantly  overshadowed  any\r\n\nlegitimate probative value.  We find this especially likely given\r\n\nthat  there  was  virtually  no other  evidence  suggesting  that\r\n\nAguilar-Aranceta was  in knowing possession of  cocaine.  Leaving\r                                          \r\n\naside  her previous  conviction, the  evidence pertaining  to the\r\n\ndefendant's state of mind  was equivocal.  The  government points\r\n\nout that  although  Aguilar-Aranceta was  poor  and was  able  to\r\n\nreceive mail at her  home, she kept a post office  box at the Old\r\n\nSan  Juan  Post  Office.     Nevertheless,  Aguilar-Aranceta  was\r\n\napparently in no hurry to  get the packages.  In fact,  nine days\r\n\npassed between the time the first set of claim slips were  placed\r\n\nin Aguilar-Aranceta's box and the time that Aguilar-Aranceta went\r\n\nto pick up the packages.  Similarly, her  behavior at the counter\r\n\nwas of uncertain significance.  The window clerk could only state\r\n\nthat  since  she  did  not  expressly  refuse  the  packages,  he\r\n\ncontinued to  leave  them  on  the  counter.    The  government's\r\n\nargument  that  Aguilar-Aranceta's  demonstrated  reluctance  was\r\n\nmerely  a smokescreen to conceal her knowledge of the contents of\r\n\nthe packages is dubious, especially in light of the fact that the\r\n\nwindow  clerk could  have taken  back the  packages at  any time.\r\n\nPerhaps because  the government's evidence was  weak with respect\r\n\nto  the  current charges  (particularly  so  because it  arrested\r\n\nAguilar-Aranceta before she had  a chance to open the  packages),\r\n\nit focused the jury's attention on her prior  conviction.  In any\r\n\ncase,  we  think that  the  amount  of  evidence introduced  with\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nrespect  to  her  prior  conviction  dramatically  increased  the\r\n\nlikelihood that the jury  convicted Aguilar-Aranceta on the basis\r\n\nof the 1986 conviction alone rather than on  a fair assessment of\r\n\nthe evidence.\r\n\n          The  gravity  of  the  unfair prejudice  is  even  more\r\n\napparent  when one  considers that  the prior conviction  was not\r\n\nmerely one part of the government's attempt to establish Aguilar-\r\n\nAranceta's state of mind.   It was the entire case.   The offense\r\n\nof possession with intent to distribute cannot be \"established by\r\n\nproof merely  that a  package  containing drugs  was mailed  from\r\n\noutside this country and was received and opened by the addressee\r\n\nof the package  inside this country.  The  threat this would pose\r\n\nto  innocent  victims  of  mere  mistake  or  actual  set-ups  is\r\n\nobvious.\"  United States v.

This logic applies with equal or greater force to someone\r\n\nwith  a  previous  conviction  for  narcotics  trafficking.    In\r\n\nessence,  admitting  Aguilar-Aranceta's prior  conviction allowed\r\n\nthe jury  to convict her upon  facts that would  likely have been\r\n\ninsufficient to convict a  similarly situated defendant without a\r\n\nprior conviction.   In sum,  we think that  evidence of  Aguilar-\r\n\nAranceta's prior conviction should have been excluded because its\r\n\nmarginal probative value, coupled with the scarcity and equivocal\r\n\nnature of  the other evidence relating  to the Aguilar-Aranceta's\r\n\nstate of mind, created  an unacceptable risk that the  jury would\r\n\nassume  that  Aguilar-Aranceta  had  a  propensity for  narcotics\r\n\ntrafficking and convict on that basis alone.\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n          D.
