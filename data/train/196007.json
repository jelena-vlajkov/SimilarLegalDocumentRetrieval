The appellant, Joseph Piccione, pled guilty\r                           \n\nto  one count of making  and presenting to  the U.S. Treasury\n\nDepartment a false, fictitious, and fraudulent claim  against\n\nthe United States for  payment, in violation of 18  U.S.C.   \n\n287 and 2.   Based on  a total offense  level of eight and  a\n\ncriminal history category of II, the guideline range was four\n\nmonths  to  ten  months.1     The  district  court  sentenced\n\nPiccione  to ten  months imprisonment,  a three-year  term of\n\nsupervised release, and a $5,000 fine.\n\n     The only issue on  appeal is whether the  district court\n\nclearly  erred  in  refusing  to give  Piccione  a  two-level\n\ndownward adjustment  as a minor participant  in that criminal\n\nactivity.   See  United States v. Cassiere, 4 F.3d 1006, 1026\r                                                      \n\n(1st  Cir. 1993)  (reiterating  the clear  error standard  of\n\nreview).

See United States  v. Reyes,  3\r                                                                     \n\nF.3d 29, 29-30 (1st Cir. 1993) (noting that, in the case of a\n\nguilty  plea,  the  PSR  and sentencing  transcript  are  the\n\nappropriate materials from which to draw the relevant facts).\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  It is undisputed that  the relevant sentencing guidelines\nwere those effective November 1, 1993, and all references are\nto that  version.   We see no  need to explicate  the interim\ncalculations  on  which  the  total  offense  level  and  the\ncriminal history category were based.\r\r\n\n     Between  March  6,  and April  15,  1993,  28 false  and\n\nfraudulent income  tax returns  were filed with  the Internal\n\nRevenue Service  (IRS).  Each of  the tax returns was  in the\n\nname  of an  actual person with  the correct  social security\n\nnumber.  Each  of the names, however, was that of a sentenced\n\nprisoner.  Each of  the returns was supported by a  false and\n\nfraudulent W-2 Wage and Tax Statement for 1992 (\"W-2\").  Each\n\nW-2  listed one of  two employers  with the  correct employer\n\nidentification  number  for  the  respective  employer.   The\n\nfigures  purporting to  represent  wages earned,  federal tax\n\nwithheld,  and  refund due  were  identical  on  many of  the\n\nreturns.   The total amount of  the refunds claimed on the 28\n\ntax returns was $32,770.\n\n     Six  of the  28  tax returns  contained fingerprints  of\n\nthree prisoners  incarcerated at the state  prison in Somers,\n\nConnecticut.   None of the 28 tax  returns was in the name of\n\nany  of these three particular prisoners.  One of these three\n\nprisoners was Donald D'Amico.   D'Amico is Piccione's cousin.\n\nTelephone records revealed telephone  toll calls between  the\n\nSomers prison and Piccione's home.\n\n     Each of the 28 tax returns listed a home address of Post\n\nOffice  Box  20256,  Cranston,  Rhode Island  (\"Box  20256\").\n\nPiccione had rented Box 20256 in October 1992 under the alias\n\nMark S.  LaRoche.  The Postal Service issued a single key for\n\nBox 20256.\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n     On June 7,  1993, IRS Special  Agents placed four  decoy\n\nincome tax  refund checks in Box 20256.  The four checks were\n\nin names identical to those on four of the false tax returns.\n\nOn  June 7,  Piccione,  using a  key,  opened Box  20256  and\n\nremoved the  checks.   As he  left the  post  office, he  was\n\narrested.  The four decoy checks, the key to Box 20256, and a\n\nreceipt  showing payment for rental of that box were found in\n\nhis possession.\n\n     Several  refund checks,  generated by  the 28  false and\n\nfraudulent  tax returns, were issued by the IRS.  The checks,\n\nhowever, were seized  by IRS agents from the  Postal Service.\n\nNo  refund checks  were  negotiated by  the conspirators  and\n\nthere was no out-of-pocket loss to the government.\n\n                             II.\r                                            \n\n     On  appeal, Piccione  contends, as  he did  below, that,\n\nbecause, at most, his role in the offense was that of a minor\n\nparticipant,  he   should   receive  a   two-level   downward\n\nadjustment  in  the  total offense  level.    See  U.S.S.G.  \r                                                             \n\n3B1.2(b) (providing for a two-level downward adjustment for a\n\nminor  participant).  A minor participant is one \"who is less\n\nculpable than most other participants.\"  Id., comment. (n.3);\r                                                        \n\nsee also id.,  comment. (backg'd)  (one who plays  a part  in\r                        \n\ncommitting the  offense  that makes  him  substantially  less\n\nculpable than the average participant).\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n     Piccione argues  that he was not  the \"mastermind behind\n\nthis  criminal  endeavor,\"  pointing  instead  to  the  three\n\nprisoners whose fingerprints  were on six of  the 28 returns,\n\nand  claiming that  he  is  less  culpable  than  they.    He\n\ncharacterizes his role as \"simply one of mail retriver [sic]\"\n\nand neither the \"architect nor an important cog.\"\n\n     Piccione has the  burden of proving  that he merits  the\n\ndownward  adjustment   in  the  offense  level   as  a  minor\n\nparticipant --  a determination which is  fact-bound.  United\r                                                                         \n\nStates v. Ortiz,  966 F.2d  707, 717 (1st  Cir. 1992),  cert.\r                                                                         \n\ndenied, 113  S. Ct. 1005 (1993).   We need not  disagree with\r                  \n\nPiccione's claim that he was  not the mastermind or architect\n\nof this scheme.  Even assuming that is so, that  does not aid\n\nPiccione  in  this  case.    No  defendant  is  automatically\n\nentitled to the downward adjustment, even if he happens to be\n\nless culpable than others  involved in the criminal activity.\n\nUnited  States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 460 (1st Cir.), cert.\r                                                                         \n\ndenied, 115 S.  Ct. 80, 81 (1994); see  also United States v.\r                                                                      \n\nDaniel,  962 F.2d 100, 103 (1st Cir. 1992) (agreeing with the\r                  \n\nproposition that \"the fact that a particular defendant may be\n\nleast  culpable  among  those   who  are  actually  named  as\n\ndefendants does not establish that he performed a minor  role\n\nin the  conspiracy\",  quoting United  States v.Zaccardi,  924\r                                                                   \n\nF.2d 201, 203 (11th Cir. 1991)).\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n     In this case, Piccione's claim that he was simply a mail\n\nretriever  and  an  unimportant  cog  is patently  erroneous.\n\nIndeed, it is obvious that  Piccione's role was necessary for\n\nthe  scheme's success.   The  IRS would  not send  tax refund\n\nchecks to a prison  address.  For a successful  completion of\n\nthe  plot,  the  inmates   needed  someone  on  the  outside.\n\nPiccione was that someone.  He leased the postal box under an\n\nalias and  retrieved  the decoy  checks  in an  apparent  and\n\nessential   step  along  the   path  toward   their  intended\n\nnegotiation.\n\n     We  agree with the  district court judge  who stated, \"I\n\ncan't conceive of this  being a minor role.\"   Sentencing Tr.\n\nat p. 16.   As we stated at the  outset, there was no  error,\n\nclear or otherwise, in the  district court's rejection of the\n\nrequest for a two-level downward adjustment.\n\n     Affirmed.  See Loc.

PICCIONE, Defendant, Appellant.</p>\n    <p class=\"docket\">No. 94-2171</p>\n    <p class=\"court\">United States Court of Appeals,<br>First Circuit.</p>\n    <p class=\"date\">April 6, 1995</p>\n    <div class=\"prelims\">\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island [Hon.  Raymond J. Pettine, Senior U.S. District Judge ]</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joseph A. Bevilacqua, Jr. on brief for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sheldon Whitehouse, United States Attorney, Margaret E. Curran, Assistant United States Attorney, and Kenneth P. Madden, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.R.I.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before TORRUELLA, Chief Judge, SELYA and BOUDIN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PER CURIAM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant, Joseph Piccione, pled guilty to one count of making and presenting to the U.S. Treasury Department a false, fictitious, and fraudulent claim against the United States for payment, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Secs. 287 and 2.  Based on a total offense level of eight and a criminal history category of II, the guideline range was four months to ten months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The district court sentenced Piccione to ten months imprisonment, a three-year term of supervised release, and a $5,000 fine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only issue on appeal is whether the district court clearly erred in refusing to give Piccione a two-level downward adjustment as a minor participant in that criminal activity.  See United States v. Cassiere, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194928\"><a href=\"/opinion/194928/united-states-v-cassiere/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1006</span></a></span>, 1026 (1st Cir. 1993) (reiterating the clear error standard of review).  There was no error, clear or otherwise.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Piccione pled guilty, we recite the relevant facts from the Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) and the transcript of the sentencing hearing.  See United States v. Reyes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194897\"><a href=\"/opinion/194897/united-states-v-reyes/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 29- 30 (1st Cir. 1993) (noting that, in the case of a guilty plea, the PSR and sentencing transcript are the appropriate materials from which to draw the relevant facts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between March 6, and April 15, 1993, 28 false and fraudulent income tax returns were filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  Each of the tax returns was in the name of an actual person with the correct social security number.  Each of the names, however, was that of a sentenced prisoner.  Each of the returns was supported by a false and fraudulent W-2 Wage and Tax Statement for 1992 (\"W-2\").  Each W-2 listed one of two employers with the correct employer identification number for the respective employer.  The figures purporting to represent wages earned, federal tax withheld, and refund due were identical on many of the returns.  The total amount of the refunds claimed on the 28 tax returns was $32,770.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six of the 28 tax returns contained fingerprints of three prisoners incarcerated at the state prison in Somers, Connecticut.  None of the 28 tax returns was in the name of any of these three particular prisoners.  One of these three prisoners was Donald D'Amico.  D'Amico is Piccione's cousin.  Telephone records revealed telephone toll calls between the Somers prison and Piccione's home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of the 28 tax returns listed a home address of Post Office Box 20256, Cranston, Rhode Island (\"Box 20256\").  Piccione had rented Box 20256 in October 1992 under the alias Mark S. LaRoche.  The Postal Service issued a single key for Box 20256.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 7, 1993, IRS Special Agents placed four decoy income tax refund checks in Box 20256.  The four checks were in names identical to those on four of the false tax returns.  On June 7, Piccione, using a key, opened Box 20256 and removed the checks.  As he left the post office, he was arrested.  The four decoy checks, the key to Box 20256, and a receipt showing payment for rental of that box were found in his possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several refund checks, generated by the 28 false and fraudulent tax returns, were issued by the IRS.  The checks, however, were seized by IRS agents from the Postal Service.  No refund checks were negotiated by the conspirators and there was no out-of-pocket loss to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Piccione contends, as he did below, that, because, at most, his role in the offense was that of a minor participant, he should receive a two-level downward adjustment in the total offense level.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.2(b) (providing for a two-level downward adjustment for a minor participant).  A minor participant is one \"who is less culpable than most other participants.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194897\"><a href=\"/opinion/194897/united-states-v-reyes/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span> comment.  (n.3); </a></span> see also <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194897\"><a href=\"/opinion/194897/united-states-v-reyes/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> comment.  (backg'd) </a></span>(one who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Piccione argues that he was not the \"mastermind behind this criminal endeavor,\" pointing instead to the three prisoners whose fingerprints were on six of the 28 returns, and claiming that he is less culpable than they.  He characterizes his role as \"simply one of mail retriver [sic]\" and neither the \"architect nor an important cog.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Piccione has the burden of proving that he merits the downward adjustment in the offense level as a minor participant-a determination which is fact-bound.  United States v. Ortiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584511\"><a href=\"/opinion/584511/united-states-v-ruben-ortiz-aka-ruben-ortiz-de-jesus-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>, 717 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span> </span>(1993).  We need not disagree with Piccione's claim that he was not the mastermind or architect of this scheme.  Even assuming that is so, that does not aid Piccione in this case.  No defendant is automatically entitled to the downward adjustment, even if he happens to be less culpable than others involved in the criminal activity.  United States v. Brandon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span>, 460 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></span>, 81 (1994);  see also United States v. Daniel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582532\"><a href=\"/opinion/582532/united-states-v-jose-daniel/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 103 (1st Cir. 1992) (agreeing with the proposition that \"the fact that a particular defendant may be least culpable among those who are actually named as defendants does not establish that he performed a minor role in the conspiracy\", quoting United States v.Zaccardi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555023\"><a href=\"/opinion/555023/united-states-v-gregory-zaccardi/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span>, 203 (11th Cir. 1991)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Piccione's claim that he was simply a mail retriever and an unimportant cog is patently erroneous.  Indeed, it is obvious that Piccione's role was necessary for the scheme's success.  The IRS would not send tax refund checks to a prison address.  For a successful completion of the plot, the inmates needed someone on the outside.  Piccione was that someone.  He leased the postal box under an alias and retrieved the decoy checks in an apparent and essential step along the path toward their intended negotiation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court judge who stated, \"I can't conceive of this being a minor role.\"  Sentencing Tr. at p. 16.  As we stated at the outset, there was no error, clear or otherwise, in the district court's rejection of the request for a two-level downward adjustment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed. See Loc.  R. 27.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> It is undisputed that the relevant sentencing guidelines were those effective November 1, 1993, and all references are to that version.  We see no need to explicate the interim calculations on which the total offense level and the criminal history category were based</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
