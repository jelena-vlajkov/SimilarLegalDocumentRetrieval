In  July 1989,  Doctor's  Hospital  (the\r                            \n\n\"Hospital\")  filed a chapter 11 petition in the United States\n\nBankruptcy   Court  for   the   District  of   Puerto   Rico.\n\nThereafter, the Hospital  continued to operate  as debtor-in-\n\npossession.   The  following  year the  Hospital hired  Ramon\n\nVilar to serve as its Hospital Administrator.  Vilar signed a\n\nfive-year employment  contract with the Hospital  on December\n\n14, 1990.    Under the  contract, Vilar  was given  \"complete\n\nautonomy\" in the day-to-day operation of the hospital.\n\n     By October  1991, the Hospital  desperately needed funds\n\nin order  to continue  operating.  To  secure financing,  the\n\nHospital entered into a court-approved agreement with Medicos\n\nEspecializados  y  de   Emergencias,  Inc.  (\"Medicos\")   and\n\nMedicos' President,  Dr. Roberto  Kutcher Olivio.   Under the\n\nagreement,  Medicos and  Kutcher acquired  51 percent  of the\n\nHospital's capital  stock;  and Medicos  and Kutcher  assumed\n\nresponsibility for administering and operating  the Hospital.\n\nThe  agreement took  effect  on  November  1,  1991,  and  on\n\nNovember 4,  1991, Kutcher  informed Vilar that  his contract\n\nwith the Hospital was terminated.\n\n     Vilar   then  filed   with  the   bankruptcy  court   an\n\napplication for payment of administrative expenses, including\n\nexpenses for severance  pay and vacation pay,  pursuant to 11\n\nU.S.C.    503(b)(1)(A).    Administrative expenses  are  \"the\n\nactual,  necessary  costs  and  expenses  of  preserving  the\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nestate,  including  wages,   salaries,  or  commissions   for\n\nservices rendered after  the commencement of the case\".   Id.\r                                                                         \n\nSeverance  and   vacation  pay,  incident   to  post-petition\n\nemployment,   are  widely  considered  to  be  administrative\n\nexpenses.  See, e.g., Matter  of Schatz Federal Bearings Co.,\r                                                                         \n\nInc., 5 B.R. 549, 552 (S.D.N.Y. Bankr. 1980).  The Bankruptcy\r                \n\nCode, 11 U.S.C.   507(a)(1), assigns first-priority status to\n\nsection 503(b) expenses to  encourage third parties to supply\n\nthose  goods  and  services  necessary  to  rehabilitate  the\n\ndebtor's business. See, e.g.,  In re Mammoth Mart,  Inc., 536\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d 950 (1st Cir. 1976).\n\n     Clause 4(a) of the contract  allowed Vilar four weeks of\n\ncompensated vacation time for each year that the contract was\n\nin effect.  Vilar based his claim for severance pay on clause\n\n13  of  his  employment  contract with  the  Hospital,  which\n\nstates:\n\n     The Board may, in its discretion, terminate Vilar's\n     duties  as Administrator  of  the  Hospital.   Such\n     action will  require a  majority vote of  the Board\n     and will become effective  when such vote is taken.\n     After  such termination,  all  rights,  duties  and\n     obligations of both parties shall cease except that\n     Hospital  will  continue  to  pay  Vilar  his  then\n     monthly salary of  (sic) for the month in which his\n     duties were terminated and  for six (6) consecutive\n     months  thereafter,  as  agreed   upon  termination\n     payment.\n\n     In  June  1992  the  bankruptcy  court  heard  testimony\n\nconcerning Vilar's application  for payment of administrative\n\nexpenses.  The Hospital  objected to the application, arguing\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nthat it  did not have  to pay Vilar  anything because  he had\n\nbeen  terminated for cause.  According to the Hospital, Vilar\n\nhad breached  the contract because  he had failed  to perform\n\nhis duties as Administrator  and because he was insubordinate\n\nand  negligent.   Vilar  maintained  that  he  satisfactorily\n\nperformed all of his obligations under the contract.\n\n     At the  conclusion of the hearing,  the bankruptcy court\n\nstated that \"[t]he evidence . . . shows that the [Hospital's]\n\nboard  of  directors  may have  had  cause  to  terminate the\n\nemployment contract but opted not to do so.\"  The court found\n\nthat  Medicos  and  Kutcher  had terminated  Vilar  with  the\n\napproval of  the Hospital's board  of directors and  that the\n\ntermination had  triggered Clause 13, thereby  giving Vilar a\n\nvalid claim for severance pay.   However, the court concluded\n\nthat  the claim  for  severance pay,  although allowed  as an\n\nunsecured claim, was not  entitled to priority status because\n\nclause 13 did not  benefit the estate.  The  bankruptcy court\n\ndid find that Vilar was due vacation pay as an administrative\n\npriority.\n\n     On review,  the district  court affirmed  the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's  allowance  of  both  claims.    The  district  court\n\nspecifically  endorsed  the finding  of the  bankruptcy court\n\nthat the dismissal had not been made for cause.  The district\n\ncourt  also upheld  the bankruptcy  court's holding  that the\n\nclaim for vacation pay was an administrative expense, but the\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\ndistrict  court  reversed  with  respect  to  severance  pay,\n\nconcluding that it too was an administrative expense entitled\n\nto priority.  \n\n     On appeal, the Hospital disputes that Vilar has a  valid\n\nclaim to severance and vacation pay.  The Hospital's argument\n\nis simple:   it treats  the bankruptcy  court's reference  to\n\ncause--that the  Hospital \"may  have had cause\"  to terminate\n\nVilar--as a determination that Vilar did breach his contract.\n\nBut \"may have\" and \"did\" are two different things.  Even if a\n\nmaterial  breach  by Vilar  would  excuse  the Hospital  from\n\npaying severance or vacation pay, there is no such finding of\n\ncause here.\n\n     The bankruptcy judge seems  to have treated the Hospital\n\nas  having  waived any  such claim  of  breach by  failing to\n\nassert, when it fired Vilar, that it was doing so  because of\n\nVilar's misconduct.   Whether the bankruptcy  judge was right\n\nor wrong on this issue of waiver is not before us because the\n\nHospital offers no  argument to show that he  was wrong.  Why\n\nthe Hospital has chosen to argue the case on a ground refuted\n\nby the bankruptcy court's own order is a complete mystery.\n\n     The Hospital  also attacks the priority  status afforded\n\nto the vacation and severance claims, but again its principal\n\nground is the mistaken assumption that the Hospital was found\n\nto  have  cause  to  terminate  the  contract.   Indeed,  the\n\nHospital   admits  that  most  courts  that  have  considered\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nseverance  pay  claims  in  bankruptcy have  held  that  they\n\ncomprise an administrative expense entitled to priority.  The\n\nreason, as  the Hospital  states, is  that the  severance pay\n\ncommitment is  a cost of carrying on  the business.  E.g., In\r                                                                         \n\nre Golden  Distributors, Ltd., 134 B.R.  760 (S.D.N.Y. Bankr.\r                                         \n\n1991).   The  only disagreement,  not presented  here, arises\n\nwhere the contract was made prior to bankruptcy.  E.g., id.\r                                                                       \n\n     The  closest  that  the  Hospital  comes  to  raising  a\n\ncolorable  issue on  appeal  is to  defend,  in a  couple  of\n\nsentences,  the bankruptcy court's initial determination that\n\nthe  severance pay  should  not be  given  a priority.    The\n\nreason, says the Hospital,  is that the severance pay  is not\n\nlinked  to  the services  provided  post petition  or  to the\n\nlength of employment but was provided in compensation for the\n\ntermination of the contract.\n\n     The  short answer is that  the severance provision was a\n\ncontracted  for  employment  benefit,  just  like  salary  or\n\nvacation  pay,  promised in  exchange  for Vilar's  services.\r                                                      \n\nVilar earned  it by  providing post-petition services  (or at\n\nleast   there  is  no  finding  to  the  contrary),  and  the\n\ncommitment to pay severance, together with other commitments,\n\nbenefited  the  estate  by  inducing  Vilar  to  act  as  the\n\nHospital's administrator.  In these  circumstances, severance\n\npay  falls  squarely  within  the rationale  for  allowing  a\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\npriority.

Administrative expenses are \"the actual, necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate, including wages, salaries, or commissions for services rendered after the commencement of the case\".  Id. Severance and vacation pay, incident to post-petition employment, are widely considered to be administrative expenses.  See, e.g., Matter of Schatz Federal Bearings Co., Inc., 5 B.R. 549, 552 (S.D.N.Y. Bankr. 1980).  The Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C.

Thereafter, the Hospital continued to operate as debtor-in-possession.  The following year the Hospital hired Ramon Vilar to serve as its Hospital Administrator.  Vilar signed a five-year employment contract with the Hospital on December 14, 1990.  Under the contract, Vilar was given \"complete autonomy\" in the day-to-day operation of the hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By October 1991, the Hospital desperately needed funds in order to continue operating.  To secure financing, the Hospital entered into a court-approved agreement with Medicos Especializados y de Emergencias, Inc.  (\"Medicos\") and Medicos' President, Dr. Roberto Kutcher Olivio.  Under the agreement, Medicos and Kutcher acquired 51 percent of the Hospital's capital stock;  and Medicos and Kutcher assumed responsibility for administering and operating the Hospital.  The agreement took effect on November 1, 1991, and on November 4, 1991, Kutcher informed Vilar that his contract with the Hospital was terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vilar then filed with the bankruptcy court an application for payment of administrative expenses, including expenses for severance pay and vacation pay, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Sec. 503(b)(1)(A).  Administrative expenses are \"the actual, necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate, including wages, salaries, or commissions for services rendered after the commencement of the case\".  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Severance and </span>vacation pay, incident to post-petition employment, are widely considered to be administrative expenses.  See, e.g., Matter of Schatz Federal Bearings Co., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1534857\"><a href=\"/opinion/1534857/matter-of-schatz-federal-bearings-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, 552 (S.D.N.Y. Bankr. 1980).  The Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. Sec. 507(a)(1), assigns first-priority status to section 503(b) expenses to encourage third parties to supply those goods and services necessary to rehabilitate the debtor's business.  See, e.g., In re Mammoth Mart, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"336186\"><a href=\"/opinion/336186/in-re-mammoth-mart-inc-debtor-stanley-cramer-v-mammoth-mart-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">950</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clause 4(a) of the contract allowed Vilar four weeks of compensated vacation time for each year that the contract was in effect.  Vilar based his claim for severance pay on clause 13 of his employment contract with the Hospital, which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>The Board may, in its discretion, terminate Vilar's duties as Administrator of the Hospital.  Such action will require a majority vote of the Board and will become effective when such vote is taken.  After such termination, all rights, duties and obligations of both parties shall cease except that Hospital will continue to pay Vilar his then monthly salary of (sic) for the month in which his duties were terminated and for six (6) consecutive months thereafter, as agreed upon termination payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1992 the bankruptcy court heard testimony concerning Vilar's application for payment of administrative expenses.  The Hospital objected to the application, arguing that it did not have to pay Vilar anything because he had been terminated for cause.  According to the Hospital, Vilar had breached the contract because he had failed to perform his duties as Administrator and because he was insubordinate and negligent.  Vilar maintained that he satisfactorily performed all of his obligations under the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the bankruptcy court stated that \"[t]he evidence ... shows that the [Hospital's] board of directors may have had cause to terminate the employment contract but opted not to do so.\"  The court found that Medicos and Kutcher had terminated Vilar with the approval of the Hospital's board of directors and that the termination had triggered Clause 13, thereby giving Vilar a valid claim for severance pay.  However, the court concluded that the claim for severance pay, although allowed as an unsecured claim, was not entitled to priority status because clause 13 did not benefit the estate.  The bankruptcy court did find that Vilar was due vacation pay as an administrative priority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On review, the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court's allowance of both claims.  The district court specifically endorsed the finding of the bankruptcy court that the dismissal had not been made for cause.  The district court also upheld the bankruptcy court's holding that the claim for vacation pay was an administrative expense, but the district court reversed with respect to severance pay, concluding that it too was an administrative expense entitled to priority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Hospital disputes that Vilar has a valid claim to severance and vacation pay.  The Hospital's argument is simple:  it treats the bankruptcy court's reference to cause-that the Hospital \"may have had cause\" to terminate Vilar-as a determination that Vilar did breach his contract.  But \"may have\" and \"did\" are two different things.  Even if a material breach by Vilar would excuse the Hospital from paying severance or vacation pay, there is no such finding of cause here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy judge seems to have treated the Hospital as having waived any such claim of breach by failing to assert, when it fired Vilar, that it was doing so because of Vilar's misconduct.  Whether the bankruptcy judge was right or wrong on this issue of waiver is not before us because the Hospital offers no argument to show that he was wrong.  Why the Hospital has chosen to argue the case on a ground refuted by the bankruptcy court's own order is a complete mystery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital also attacks the priority status afforded to the vacation and severance claims, but again its principal ground is the mistaken assumption that the Hospital was found to have cause to terminate the contract.  Indeed, the Hospital admits that most courts that have considered severance pay claims in bankruptcy have held that they comprise an administrative expense entitled to priority.  The reason, as the Hospital states, is that the severance pay commitment is a cost of carrying on the business.  E.g., In re Golden Distributors, Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1846284\"><a href=\"/opinion/1846284/in-re-golden-distributors-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">760</span> </a></span>(S.D.N.Y. Bankr. 1991).  The only disagreement, not presented here, arises where the contract was made prior to bankruptcy.  E.g., id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The closest that the Hospital comes to raising a colorable issue on appeal is to defend, in a couple of sentences, the bankruptcy court's initial determination that the severance pay should not be given a priority.  The reason, says the Hospital, is that the severance pay is not linked to the services provided post petition or to the length of employment but was provided in compensation for the termination of the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short answer is that the severance provision was a contracted for employment benefit, just like salary or vacation pay, promised in exchange for Vilar's services.  Vilar earned it by providing post-petition services (or at least there is no finding to the contrary), and the commitment to pay severance, together with other commitments, benefited the estate by inducing Vilar to act as the Hospital's administrator.  In these circumstances, severance pay falls squarely within the rationale for allowing a priority.
