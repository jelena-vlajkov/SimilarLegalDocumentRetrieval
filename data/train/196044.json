P.  2014(a), a  Chapter  11 trustee  may  employ\n\nprofessionals, with the  bankruptcy court's  approval, to  assist\n\nhim in  fulfilling his  duties.1   In  this appeal,  we uphold  a\n\nruling denying an afterthought  application for the employment of\n\na  professional.   In the  process, we  address two  questions of\n\nnovel  impression in this circuit.  First, may a bankruptcy court\n\napprove a professional's employment  when no application is filed\n\nuntil after the services in question have been rendered?  Second,\n\nif  belated  applications  are  cognizable  at  all,  what  legal\n\nstandard should the bankruptcy courts apply in passing upon them?\n\n          We  hold, in  general  concordance with  several  other\n\ncircuits, that a  bankruptcy court  may grant such  a post  facto\r                                                                           \n\napplication,  but only  if it  can be  demonstrated (1)  that the\n\nemployment satisfies the statutory requirements, and (2) that the\n                    \r                              \n\n     1The statute provides that\n\n          the trustee, with  the court's approval,  may\n          employ  one  or more  attorneys, accountants,\n          appraisers,     auctioneers,     or     other\n          professional  persons,  that do  not  hold or\n          represent an interest  adverse to the estate,\n          and  that  are   disinterested  persons,   to\n          represent or assist  the trustee in  carrying\n          out the trustee's duties . . . . \n\n11 U.S.C.    327(a) (1988).   Bankruptcy Rule 2014(a)  implements\nthe  statute.   It provides  in pertinent  part that  a trustee's\napplication for the employment  of a professional person pursuant\nto section 327(a)  shall state, inter  alia, \"the specific  facts\r                                                     \nshowing  the necessity for the employment, the name of the person\nto be employed,  the reasons for the  selection, the professional\nservices  to  be rendered,  [and]  any  proposed arrangement  for\ncompensation . . . .\"   Although the statute and the rule operate\nin tandem, we  shall for  simplicity's sake refer  mainly to  the\nformer.\n\n                                2\r\r\n\ndelay  in  seeking  court approval  resulted  from  extraordinary\n\ncircumstances.   Relatedly,  we  hold  that tardiness  occasioned\n\nmerely   by   oversight  cannot   qualify  as   an  extraordinary\n\ncircumstance under the second prong of the aforesaid test.\n\n                                I\r                                          I\r                                           \n\n                      Statement of the Case\r                                Statement of the Case\r                                                     \n\n          The material facts are  not in dispute.  On  August 27,\n\n1992, the  debtors, Donald  and Joyce Jarvis,  filed a  voluntary\n\npetition seeking relief under Chapter  11 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\nOn February 17,  1993, the bankruptcy  court appointed Andrew  S.\n\nRichardson, a veteran insolvency lawyer, as trustee.\n\n          In executing his duties, Richardson deemed it desirable\n\nto evaluate several parcels  of real estate in which  the debtors\n\nheld ownership interests.  To this end, he retained Peter Scotti,\n\na  prominent Rhode  Island appraiser  and broker.   Although both\n\nRichardson  and  Scotti were  familiar  with the  need  for prior\n\njudicial approval of professional employment,  neither man sought\n\nauthorization  from the  bankruptcy  court before  or during  the\n\nperiod in which services were rendered.\n\n          Scotti did  yeoman work  for the  estate.   Among other\n\nthings,  he arranged a sale  of a two-acre  parcel in Portsmouth,\n\nRhode  Island,  for  $275,000.    The  bankruptcy  court  granted\n\nRichardson's  petition  for  permission  to  sell  the  land  and\n\napproved  the sales  agreement  (which made  provision  for a  5%\n\nbrokerage  commission).   When  the time  came  to pay  the  fee,\n\nRichardson realized that the  court had never authorized Scotti's\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nemployment.   He then assembled  a \"Nunc Pro  Tunc Application to\n\nEmploy  Broker\" and  submitted it  to the  bankruptcy court  in a\n\nbelated effort to remedy the oversight.2\n\n          After holding a hearing,  the bankruptcy court found no\n\nextraordinary circumstances  and denied the application.   See In\r                                                                           \n\nre  Jarvis, 169  B.R.  276, 277-79  (Bankr.  D.R.I. 1994).    The\r                    \n\ntrustee appealed to  the district  court.  On  October 26,  1994,\n\nthat court, ruling  ore tenus, refused to disturb  the bankruptcy\r                                       \n\ncourt's order.  This appeal ensued.\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r                                            \n\n                            Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \n\n                                A.\r                                          A.\r                                           \n\n                      Post Facto Authorization\r                                Post Facto Authorization\r                                                        \n\n          In surveying  the terrain  occupied by section  327(a),\n\nthe threshold  question is whether  the statute permits  the post\r                                                                           \n\nfacto  authorization of  professional services  at all.   Because\r               \n\nthis  inquiry is strictly a matter of statutory construction, our\n\npower of  interpretive scrutiny  is plenary.   See,  e.g., United\r                                                                           \n\nStates v.

See  In re\r                                                                           \nSingson,  41 F.3d  316, 318-19  (7th Cir. 1994).   To  avoid this\r                 \nlinguistic snare, we prefer the term \"post facto.\"\r                                                          \n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          If  possible, a  statute should be  construed in  a way\n\nthat conforms  to the  plain meaning  of its  text.3  See,  e.g.,\r                                                                          \n\nEstate of Cowart v.

Yari, 42  F.3d 53,  67-68 (1st  Cir. 1994),\r                                    \n\npetition for cert. filed,  63 U.S.L.W. 3692 (U.S. Mar.  13, 1995)\r                                  \n\n(No.  94-1517);  Holmquist, 36  F.3d at  159.   When  a statute's\r                                    \n\nlanguage is ambiguous, however,  a court must often  venture into\n\nextratextual  territory  in  order   to  distill  an  appropriate\n\nconstruction.  See Pritzker, 42 F.3d at 67; see also  Sullivan v.\r                                                                        \n\nCIA, 992  F.2d 1249,  1252 (1st Cir.  1993) (noting the  power of\r             \n\ncourts to  \"look behind statutory language\"  when the legislature\n\n\"blow[s] an uncertain trumpet\").\n\n          In this  instance,  the  statutory  language,  for  all\n\nintents and  purposes, is indeterminate.   Section 327(a) neither\n\nexpressly  sanctions   nor  expressly  forbids  the   post  facto\r                                                                           \n\nauthorization  of outside  professional  services.   Courts  have\n\nrepeatedly remarked this ambiguity.  See, e.g., In re Singson, 41\r                                                                       \n\nF.3d 316, 319 (7th Cir.  1994); In re Triangle Chems.,  Inc., 697\r                                                                      \n\nF.2d 1280, 1289 (5th Cir. 1983).  What is more, Rule 2014(a) does\n\nnot fill  the void. The most that fairly can  be said is that the\n\nlanguage   of  both   statute   and   rule   contemplates   prior\n\nauthorization,  see  Triangle Chems.,  697  F.2d  at 1284,  1289;\r                                              \n                    \r                              \n\n     3There  are, of  course,  certain exceptions  to this  rule.\nSee, e.g., United States Nat'l Bank v.

Since\n\nthere  appears  to  be  no explicatory  legislative  history,  we\n\nproceed to a consideration of the overarching equitable design of\n\nthe Chapter 11 process.  See Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick\r                                                                           \n\nAssocs.  Ltd.   Partnership,  113  S.

A virtually unbroken skein of federal\n\nappellate    cases    have    determined   that    \"extraordinary\n\ncircumstances,\" or  something very close thereto,  see supra note\r                                                                      \n\n5, constitutes the appropriate legal standard.

We  can discern  no basis  for rejecting  this\n\nimposing array of well-reasoned opinions.\n\n          The  policies underlying  the  Chapter 11  process also\n\nfavor adoption  of the  extraordinary circumstances test.   Prior\n\napproval is to  be preferred  because it  permits the  bankruptcy\n\ncourt to supervise the administration of the estate more closely,\n\nand minimizes the chance that the court will be confronted with a\n\nfait  accompli.     To achieve  these  desirable ends,  the prior\r                        \n\napproval  requirement  must  have  teeth.   A  relatively  strict\n\nstandard,  such  as   extraordinary  circumstances,  serves  this\n\npurpose.   At  the same time, it  encourages compliance with  the\n\nstatute and  eliminates opportunities for manipulation.

Withal, no\n\nsuch  request  was made.    Because  the trustee's  tardiness  in\n\nseeking approval  was due  entirely to inadvertence,  our inquiry\n\nreduces to  whether mere oversight  falls within the  universe of\n\nextraordinary   circumstances  that   may   justify  post   facto\r                                                                           \n\nauthorization of a professional's employment. We conclude that it\n\ndoes not.  \n\n          Our conclusion is buttressed by nothing less than logic\n\nand experience, on one hand, and by precedent, on the other hand.\n\nLogic   and  experience   dictate   that  if   the  category   of\n\nextraordinary  circumstances   were  expanded  to   include  mere\n\noversight,  the  modifying  adjective  \"extraordinary\"  would  be\n\ncompletely emptied  of its  meaning.

R. Bankr.  P.  2014(a), but  also  was\n\n                                12\r\r\n\napplying  its  own  local  rule.7    The  significance  of   this\n\ncircumstance is three-fold.   First, the rule  gives plain notice\n\nof  the  \"extraordinary circumstances\"  standard.    Second, once\n\nlocal rules have been properly promulgated, lawyers and litigants\n\nare duty bound to comply with them.  See Air Line Pilots Ass'n v.\r                                                                        \n\nPrecision  Valley Aviation,  Inc.,  26 F.3d  220,  224 (1st  Cir.\r                                           \n\n1994).  Third, a special  degree of deference   above  and beyond\n\nthe   traditional  standards  of   decisionmaking  and  appellate\n\noversight   attaches to a court's interpretation of its own local\n\nrules. See,  e.g., id. (explaining that  \"[d]istrict courts enjoy\r                                \n\nbroad latitude in administering local rules\" and \"are entitled to\n\ndemand  adherence  to  specific mandates  contained  [therein]\");\n\nUnited  States  v.

P.  2014(a), a bankruptcy  court may, in  its\n\ndiscretion, consider an application  to approve the employment of\n\na professional  even  though the  professional person's  services\n\nhave  already  been rendered.   But  the  court should  grant the\n\nauthorization  only if  it  can be  shown  that the  professional\n\nperson  meets all the requirements of section 327(a) and that the\r                                                                  \n\nuntimeliness  of  the  application  results   from  extraordinary\n\ncircumstances.   Because the lack of punctuality in this case was\n\nattributable entirely to inadvertence, the district court did not\n\nerr in affirming  the bankruptcy court's denial  of the trustee's\n\npost  facto application.  Mere oversight does not fall within the\r                     \n\nrealm of extraordinary circumstances for these purposes.\n\n          Although we need go no further, we elect to add a final\n\nnote.  We are aware that Scotti rendered valuable services to the\n\nestate, and we take no pleasure in denying him the  fruits of his\n\nlabor.   But we do what we must, for the greater good lies not in\n\nthe  transient  lure  of  ad   hoc  decisionmaking,  but  in  the\r                                            \n\nevenhanded application of the rule of law.\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \n\n                                14\r\r\n",

Sec. 327(a) and Fed.R.Bankr.P. 2014(a), a Chapter 11 trustee may employ professionals, with the bankruptcy court's approval, to assist him in fulfilling his duties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In this appeal, we uphold a ruling denying an afterthought application for the employment of a professional.  In the process, we address two questions of novel impression in this circuit.  First, may a bankruptcy court approve a professional's employment when no application is filed until after the services in question have been rendered?   Second, if belated applications are cognizable at all, what legal standard should the bankruptcy courts apply in passing upon them?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, in general concordance with several other circuits, that a bankruptcy court may grant such a post facto application, but only if it can be demonstrated (1) that the employment satisfies the statutory requirements, and (2) that the delay in seeking court approval resulted from extraordinary circumstances.  Relatedly, we hold that tardiness occasioned merely by oversight cannot qualify as an extraordinary circumstance under the second prong of the aforesaid test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>* Statement of the Case</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The material facts are not in dispute.  On August 27, 1992, the debtors, Donald and Joyce Jarvis, filed a voluntary petition seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.  On February 17, 1993, the bankruptcy court appointed Andrew S. Richardson, a veteran insolvency lawyer, as trustee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In executing his duties, Richardson deemed it desirable to evaluate several parcels of real estate in which the debtors held ownership interests.  To this end, he retained Peter Scotti, a prominent Rhode Island appraiser and broker.  Although both Richardson and Scotti were familiar with the need for prior judicial approval of professional employment, neither man sought authorization from the bankruptcy court before or during the period in which services were rendered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scotti did yeoman work for the estate.  Among other things, he arranged a sale of a two-acre parcel in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, for $275,000.  The bankruptcy court granted Richardson's petition for permission to sell the land and approved the sales agreement (which made provision for a 5% brokerage commission).  When the time came to pay the fee, Richardson realized that the court had never authorized Scotti's employment.  He then assembled a \"Nunc Pro Tunc Application to Employ Broker\" and submitted it to the bankruptcy court in a belated effort to remedy the oversight.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After holding a hearing, the bankruptcy court found no extraordinary circumstances and denied the application.  See In re Jarvis, 169 B.R. 276, 277-79 (Bankr.D.R.I.1994).  The trustee appealed to the district court.  On October 26, 1994, that court, ruling ore tenus, refused to disturb the bankruptcy court's order.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>Post Facto Authorization</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In surveying the terrain occupied by section 327(a), the threshold question is whether the statute permits the post facto authorization of professional services at all.  Because this inquiry is strictly a matter of statutory construction, our power of interpretive scrutiny is plenary.  See, e.g., United States v. Holmquist, 36 F.3d 154, 158 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1797, 131 L.Ed.2d 724 (1995);  United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 472 (1st Cir.1994);  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 978 F.2d 750, 757 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If possible, a statute should be construed in a way that conforms to the plain meaning of its text.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See, e.g., Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., --- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2589, 2594, 120 L.Ed.2d 379 (1992);  Pritzker v. Yari, 42 F.3d 53, 67-68 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1959, 131 L.Ed.2d 851 (1995);  Holmquist, 36 F.3d at 159.   When a statute's language is ambiguous, however, a court must often venture into extratextual territory in order to distill an appropriate construction.  See Pritzker, 42 F.3d at 67;  see also Sullivan v. CIA, 992 F.2d 1249, 1252 (1st Cir.1993) (noting the power of courts to \"look behind statutory language\" when the legislature \"blow[s] an uncertain trumpet\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the statutory language, for all intents and purposes, is indeterminate.  Section 327(a) neither expressly sanctions nor expressly forbids the post facto authorization of outside professional services.  Courts have repeatedly remarked this ambiguity.  See, e.g., In re Singson, 41 F.3d 316, 319 (7th Cir.1994);  In re Triangle Chems., Inc., 697 F.2d 1280, 1289 (5th Cir.1983).  What is more, Rule 2014(a) does not fill the void.  The most that fairly can be said is that the language of both statute and rule contemplates prior authorization, see Triangle Chems., 697 F.2d at 1284, 1289;  Stephen R. Grensky, The Problem Presented by Professionals Who Fail to Obtain Prior Court Approval of Their Employment, 62 Am.Bankr.L.J. 185, 188-89 (1988),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> without explicitly prohibiting authorization after the fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The discerned ambiguity in section 327(a) necessarily moves us beyond the four corners of the statute's text.  Since there appears to be no explicatory legislative history, we proceed to a consideration of the overarching equitable design of the Chapter 11 process.  See Pioneer Inv. Servs.  Co. v. Brunswick Assocs.  Ltd. Partnership, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 1495, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993).  Bankruptcy courts, after all, are courts of equity, traditionally governed by equitable principles.  See, e.g., Bank of Marin v. England, 385 U.S. 99, 103, 87 S.Ct. 274, 277, 17 L.Ed.2d 197 (1966);  In re Arkansas Co., 798 F.2d 645, 648 (3d Cir.1986);  Triangle Chems., 697 F.2d at 1288.   In light of the purposefully nonmechanical nature of equity, we think it is appropriate that bankruptcy courts should be permitted to entertain post facto applications for professional services under section 327(a).  We so hold, thereby joining several of our sister circuits.  See, e.g., Singson, 41 F.3d at 319-20;  In re Land, 943 F.2d 1265, 1267-68 (10th Cir.1991);  In re F/S Airlease II, Inc., 844 F.2d 99, 105 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 852, 109 S.Ct. 137, 102 L.Ed.2d 110 (1988);  In re THC Fin.  Corp., 837 F.2d 389, 392 (9th Cir.1988);  Triangle Chems., 697 F.2d at 1289.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p>Nature of the Power;  Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the bankruptcy court's power to entertain belated applications for the employment of professionals is equitable in nature, we believe that the court's ultimate decision to grant or deny such applications is necessarily discretionary.  The cases and the commentators are in accord.  See Arkansas, 798 F.2d at 650;  Triangle Chems., 697 F.2d at 1289;  see also 2 Lawrence P. King, Collier on Bankruptcy Sec. 327.02, at 327-20 (15th ed. 1995) [hereinafter Collier on Bankruptcy ] (\"Generally it has been concluded that bankruptcy courts are empowered with discretion to grant nunc pro tunc retention orders and allow compensation.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By like token, the bankruptcy court's ruling on an attempt to secure post facto approval of an application for the employment of a professional should be reviewed by the district court under the abuse-of-discretion rubric.  See Land, 943 F.2d at 1266.   In the event of a further appeal, the court of appeals will independently review the bankruptcy court's ruling for abuse of discretion, ceding no special deference to the district court's previous determination.  See Grella v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank, 42 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir.1994) (describing levels of appellate review in bankruptcy cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <p>The Appropriate Legal Standard</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By recognizing the discretionary authority of bankruptcy courts to consider post facto applications under section 327(a), we have reached the end of the beginning rather than the beginning of the end.  We must yet select the precise legal yardstick by which such applications are to be measured.  We conclude that the applicant must demonstrate both the professional person's suitability for appointment and the existence of extraordinary circumstances sufficient to excuse the failure to file a timely application.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A bankruptcy court confronted by a post facto application for the employment of a professional should begin by inquiring into suitability;  the timing of the application does not matter unless the court makes a supportable finding that the services were reasonably necessary for the due performance of the trustee's duties, that the professional is licensed or otherwise qualified to render such services, and that the disinterestedness requirements of section 327(a) are not at risk.  In other words, the bankruptcy court must satisfy itself that, had the application been filed on time, the court would have authorized the professional's employment then and there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that the application clears this first hurdle, the bankruptcy court must next, in the exercise of its informed discretion, decide whether the particular circumstances attendant to the application are sufficiently extraordinary to warrant after-the-fact approval.  See F/S Airlease II, 844 F.2d at 105.   In fleshing out the extraordinary circumstances requirement, the Third Circuit has indicated that bankruptcy courts may consider several factors, including</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>whether the applicant or some other person bore responsibility for applying for approval;  whether the applicant was under time pressure to begin service without approval;  the amount of delay after the applicant learned that initial approval had not been granted;  [and] the extent to which compensation to the applicant will prejudice innocent third parties....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 105-06 (quoting Arkansas, 798 F.2d at 650).   Although we do not regard this compendium of considerations as exhaustive, it is a useful checklist and we commend it to the bankruptcy courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second half of this two-part test has deep roots in both precedent and policy.  A virtually unbroken skein of federal appellate cases have determined that \"extraordinary circumstances,\" or something very close thereto, see supra note 5, constitutes the appropriate legal standard.  See, e.g., Land, 943 F.2d at 1267-68;  F/S Airlease II, 844 F.2d at 105;  Triangle Chems., 697 F.2d at 1289;  In re Kroeger Properties &amp; Dev., Inc., 57 B.R. 821, 822-23 (9th Cir.  BAP 1986);  see also 2 Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, Sec. 327.02, at 327-20.  Indeed, apart from the Seventh Circuit, which recently adopted a slightly more lenient \"excusable neglect\" standard, Singson, 41 F.3d at 319-20, those courts of appeals that have considered the matter are consentient in their views.  We can discern no basis for rejecting this imposing array of well-reasoned opinions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policies underlying the Chapter 11 process also favor adoption of the extraordinary circumstances test.  Prior approval is to be preferred because it permits the bankruptcy court to supervise the administration of the estate more closely, and minimizes the chance that the court will be confronted with a fait accompli.   To achieve these desirable ends, the prior approval requirement must have teeth.  A relatively strict standard, such as extraordinary circumstances, serves this purpose.  At the same time, it encourages compliance with the statute and eliminates opportunities for manipulation.  See id. at 319;  see also Kroeger Properties, 57 B.R. at 822-23 (suggesting that restricting post facto authorization to situations involving extraordinary circumstances will curb general nonobservance of section 327(a)'s requirements);  see generally 2 Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, Sec. 327.02, at 327-20.  Finally, a rule that lends itself to a relatively small number of exceptions will inevitably help to conserve overtaxed judicial resources.  We find that these policy considerations point unerringly toward a stricter, rather than a softer, standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that a bankruptcy court may, in its discretion, grant a post facto application for professional services, provided that the applicant can demonstrate, inter alia, the existence of extraordinary circumstances sufficient to justify the application's untimeliness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D.</p>\n    <p>The Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having settled upon the proper legal standard, we make short shrift of the merits of this appeal.  We assume arguendo that the bankruptcy court would have authorized the trustee to employ Scotti had a timely request been forthcoming.  Withal, no such request was made.  Because the trustee's tardiness in seeking approval was due entirely to inadvertence, our inquiry reduces to whether mere oversight falls within the universe of extraordinary circumstances that may justify post facto authorization of a professional's employment.  We conclude that it does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is buttressed by nothing less than logic and experience, on one hand, and by precedent, on the other hand.  Logic and experience dictate that if the category of extraordinary circumstances were expanded to include mere oversight, the modifying adjective \"extraordinary\" would be completely emptied of its meaning.  Consequently, the standard itself would be stripped of its efficacy.  At some point, one must pause and inquire, like Alice to Humpty Dumpty, whether words are infinitely elastic.  See generally Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland 163 (D. Gray ed., 1971) (\"When I use a word ... it means just what I choose it to mean--neither more nor less.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The weight of authority pushes in the same direction.  Most courts have flatly refused to accept mere oversight, without more, as a legitimate basis for granting post facto approval.  See, e.g., Land, 943 F.2d at 1268 (\"Simple neglect will not justify nunc pro tunc approval of a debtor's application for the employment of a professional.\");  Arkansas, 798 F.2d at 651 (holding that \"a mere showing of oversight\" does not constitute extraordinary circumstances);  In re Shirley, 134 B.R. 940, 943 n. 4 (9th Cir.

This tenet prevails even though the professional's services have benefitted the estate.  See F/S Airlease II, 844 F.2d at 108;  In re Grimes, 115 B.R. 639, 649 (Bankr.D.S.D.1990);  In re Mason, 66 B.R. 297, 307 (Bankr.D.N.J.1986);  In re Ladycliff Coll., 35 B.R. 111, 113 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1983);  In re Morton Shoe Cos., 22 B.R. 449, 450 (Bankr.D.Mass.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the outcome of this appeal demands further justification--and we think it does not--it should be noted that, here, the bankruptcy court was not only applying section 327(a) and Fed.R.Bankr.P. 2014(a), but also was applying its own local rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The significance of this circumstance is three-fold.  First, the rule gives plain notice of the \"extraordinary circumstances\" standard.  Second, once local rules have been properly promulgated, lawyers and litigants are duty bound to comply with them.  See Air Line Pilots Ass'n v. Precision Valley Aviation, Inc., 26 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.1994).  Third, a special degree of deference--above and beyond the traditional standards of decisionmaking and appellate oversight--attaches to a court's interpretation of its own local rules.  See, e.g., id.  (explaining that \"[d]istrict courts enjoy broad latitude in administering local rules\" and \"are entitled to demand adherence to specific mandates contained [therein]\");  United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 46 (1st Cir.)  (remarking \"the widely-accepted idea that a district court should be accorded considerable latitude in applying local procedural rules of its own making\"), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 862, 110 S.Ct. 177, 107 L.Ed.2d 133 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, we hold that under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 327(a) and Fed.R.Bankr.P. 2014(a), a bankruptcy court may, in its discretion, consider an application to approve the employment of a professional even though the professional person's services have already been rendered.  But the court should grant the authorization only if it can be shown that the professional person meets all the requirements of section 327(a) and that the untimeliness of the application results from extraordinary circumstances.  Because the lack of punctuality in this case was attributable entirely to inadvertence, the district court did not err in affirming the bankruptcy court's denial of the trustee's post facto application.  Mere oversight does not fall within the realm of extraordinary circumstances for these purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we need go no further, we elect to add a final note.  We are aware that Scotti rendered valuable services to the estate, and we take no pleasure in denying him the fruits of his labor.  But we do what we must, for the greater good lies not in the transient lure of ad hoc decisionmaking, but in the evenhanded application of the rule of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The statute provides that</p>\n        <p>the trustee, with the court's approval, may employ one or more attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers, or other professional persons, that do not hold or represent an interest adverse to the estate, and that are disinterested persons, to represent or assist the trustee in carrying out the trustee's duties....</p>\n        <p>11 U.S.C.

Sec. 327(a) and Fed.R.Bankr.P. 2014(a), a Chapter 11 trustee may employ professionals, with the bankruptcy court's approval, to assist him in fulfilling his duties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In this appeal, we uphold a ruling denying an afterthought application for the employment of a professional.  In the process, we address two questions of novel impression in this circuit.  First, may a bankruptcy court approve a professional's employment when no application is filed until after the services in question have been rendered?   Second, if belated applications are cognizable at all, what legal standard should the bankruptcy courts apply in passing upon them?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, in general concordance with several other circuits, that a bankruptcy court may grant such a post facto application, but only if it can be demonstrated (1) that the employment satisfies the statutory requirements, and (2) that the delay in seeking court approval resulted from extraordinary circumstances.  Relatedly, we hold that tardiness occasioned merely by oversight cannot qualify as an extraordinary circumstance under the second prong of the aforesaid test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>* Statement of the Case</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The material facts are not in dispute.  On August 27, 1992, the debtors, Donald and Joyce Jarvis, filed a voluntary petition seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.  On February 17, 1993, the bankruptcy court appointed Andrew S. Richardson, a veteran insolvency lawyer, as trustee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In executing his duties, Richardson deemed it desirable to evaluate several parcels of real estate in which the debtors held ownership interests.  To this end, he retained Peter Scotti, a prominent Rhode Island appraiser and broker.  Although both Richardson and Scotti were familiar with the need for prior judicial approval of professional employment, neither man sought authorization from the bankruptcy court before or during the period in which services were rendered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scotti did yeoman work for the estate.  Among other things, he arranged a sale of a two-acre parcel in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, for $275,000.  The bankruptcy court granted Richardson's petition for permission to sell the land and approved the sales agreement (which made provision for a 5% brokerage commission).  When the time came to pay the fee, Richardson realized that the court had never authorized Scotti's employment.  He then assembled a \"Nunc Pro Tunc Application to Employ Broker\" and submitted it to the bankruptcy court in a belated effort to remedy the oversight.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After holding a hearing, the bankruptcy court found no extraordinary circumstances and denied the application.

The trustee appealed to the district court.  On October 26, 1994, that court, ruling ore tenus, refused to disturb the bankruptcy court's order.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>Post Facto Authorization</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In surveying the terrain occupied by section 327(a), the threshold question is whether the statute permits the post facto authorization of professional services at all.

Section 327(a) neither expressly sanctions nor expressly forbids the post facto authorization of outside professional services.  Courts have repeatedly remarked this ambiguity.  See, e.g., In re Singson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"683189\"><a href=\"/opinion/683189/32-collier-bankrcas2d-530-bankr-l-rep-p-76224-in-the-matter-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span>, 319 (7th Cir.1994);  In re Triangle Chems., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"413279\"><a href=\"/opinion/413279/in-the-matter-of-triangle-chemicals-inc-debtor-darryl-fanelli-v-nelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">697</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1280</span></a></span>, 1289 (5th Cir.1983).  What is more, Rule 2014(a) does not fill the void.

Since there appears to be no explicatory legislative history, we proceed to a consideration of the overarching equitable design of the Chapter 11 process.  See Pioneer Inv. Servs.  Co. v.

BAP 1986);  see also 2 Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, Sec. 327.02, at 327-20.  Indeed, apart from the Seventh Circuit, which recently adopted a slightly more lenient \"excusable neglect\" standard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"683189\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Singson,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/683189/32-collier-bankrcas2d-530-bankr-l-rep-p-76224-in-the-matter-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">319-20</span></a></span>, those courts of appeals that have considered the matter are consentient in their views.

Prior approval is to be preferred because it permits the bankruptcy court to supervise the administration of the estate more closely, and minimizes the chance that the court will be confronted with a fait accompli.   To achieve these desirable ends, the prior approval requirement must have teeth.  A relatively strict standard, such as extraordinary circumstances, serves this purpose.  At the same time, it encourages compliance with the statute and eliminates opportunities for manipulation.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"683189\"><a href=\"/opinion/683189/32-collier-bankrcas2d-530-bankr-l-rep-p-76224-in-the-matter-of/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 319; </a></span> see also Kroeger <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1553312\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Properties,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1553312/in-re-kroeger-properties-and-development-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> at <span class=\"page\">822-23</span> </a></span>(suggesting that restricting post facto authorization to situations involving extraordinary circumstances will curb general nonobservance of section 327(a)'s requirements);  see generally 2 Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, Sec. 327.02, at 327-20.  Finally, a rule that lends itself to a relatively small number of exceptions will inevitably help to conserve overtaxed judicial resources.  We find that these policy considerations point unerringly toward a stricter, rather than a softer, standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that a bankruptcy court may, in its discretion, grant a post facto application for professional services, provided that the applicant can demonstrate, inter alia, the existence of extraordinary circumstances sufficient to justify the application's untimeliness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D.</p>\n    <p>The Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having settled upon the proper legal standard, we make short shrift of the merits of this appeal.  We assume arguendo that the bankruptcy court would have authorized the trustee to employ Scotti had a timely request been forthcoming.  Withal, no such request was made.  Because the trustee's tardiness in seeking approval was due entirely to inadvertence, our inquiry reduces to whether mere oversight falls within the universe of extraordinary circumstances that may justify post facto authorization of a professional's employment.  We conclude that it does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is buttressed by nothing less than logic and experience, on one hand, and by precedent, on the other hand.  Logic and experience dictate that if the category of extraordinary circumstances were expanded to include mere oversight, the modifying adjective \"extraordinary\" would be completely emptied of its meaning.  Consequently, the standard itself would be stripped of its efficacy.  At some point, one must pause and inquire, like Alice to Humpty Dumpty, whether words are infinitely elastic.  See generally Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland 163 (D. Gray ed., 1971) (\"When I use a word ... it means just what I choose it to mean--neither more nor less.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The weight of authority pushes in the same direction.  Most courts have flatly refused to accept mere oversight, without more, as a legitimate basis for granting post facto approval.

First, the rule gives plain notice of the \"extraordinary circumstances\" standard.

Third, a special degree of deference--above and beyond the traditional standards of decisionmaking and appellate oversight--attaches to a court's interpretation of its own local rules.

Sec. 327(a) and Fed.R.Bankr.P. 2014(a), a bankruptcy court may, in its discretion, consider an application to approve the employment of a professional even though the professional person's services have already been rendered.  But the court should grant the authorization only if it can be shown that the professional person meets all the requirements of section 327(a) and that the untimeliness of the application results from extraordinary circumstances.  Because the lack of punctuality in this case was attributable entirely to inadvertence, the district court did not err in affirming the bankruptcy court's denial of the trustee's post facto application.  Mere oversight does not fall within the realm of extraordinary circumstances for these purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we need go no further, we elect to add a final note.  We are aware that Scotti rendered valuable services to the estate, and we take no pleasure in denying him the fruits of his labor.  But we do what we must, for the greater good lies not in the transient lure of ad hoc decisionmaking, but in the evenhanded application of the rule of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The statute provides that</p>\n        <p>the trustee, with the court's approval, may employ one or more attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers, or other professional persons, that do not hold or represent an interest adverse to the estate, and that are disinterested persons, to represent or assist the trustee in carrying out the trustee's duties....</p>\n        <p>11 U.S.C.

It provides in pertinent part that a trustee's application for the employment of a professional person pursuant to section 327(a) shall state, inter alia, \"the specific facts showing the necessity for the employment, the name of the person to be employed, the reasons for the selection, the professional services to be rendered, [and] any proposed arrangement for compensation....\"  Although the statute and the rule operate in tandem, we shall for simplicity's sake refer mainly to the former.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although courts and lawyers routinely describe such applications, as did Richardson, by using the appellation \"nunc pro tunc,\" we agree with Judge Easterbrook that such a designation is unfaithful to the accepted usage of that term in connection with the correction of court records.
