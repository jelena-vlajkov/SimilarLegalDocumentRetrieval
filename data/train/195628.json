The district  court granted summary\n\njudgment on the ground that even if plaintiff could establish\n\na  prima facie case of  age discrimination, he  had failed to\n\noffer  minimally  sufficient   proof  that  the   defendant's\n\narticulated non-discriminatory reason was a pretext, and that\n\nthe real reason for  terminating plaintiff's services was age\n\ndiscrimination.
