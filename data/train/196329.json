Tamburello\r\n\nalleges that his supervisors engaged in a course of harassment in\r\n\nretaliation for  his union  activities as  a  union steward,  and\r\n\nseeks damages under, inter  alia, the Racketeering Influenced and\r                                          \r\n\nCorrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.   1962(c) (1988), and\r\n\nthe  Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (MCRA), Mass.

We will  affirm the  dismissal \"only if  it appears\r\n\nbeyond  doubt that [Tamburello] can  prove no set  of facts which\r\n\nwould entitle him  to relief.\"  Id. (citing Conley v.

He alleges  that  soon  afterwards the  individual\r\n\ndefendants   -- the  president, general  manager, and  manager of\r\n\nComm-Tract -- began harassing, threatening and intimidating  him.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nSpecifically,  Tamburello  alleges  that   they  pulled  him  off\r\n\nfavorable jobs, replacing him with less skilled workers; gave him\r\n\nmenial  job assignments;  withheld his  personnel file  from him;\r\n\ntook  him off  jobs to  deny him  overtime pay;  made him  take a\r\n\nforced  vacation  or  face  termination; took  away  his  company\r\n\nvehicle;  and made threatening anti-union statements.  Tamburello\r\n\nalleges  that these  actions \"were  solely to  harass, embarrass,\r\n\ncoerce,  and intimidate [him] into giving up his Steward position\r\n\nwith  the Union.\"  As  a result of  this intimidation, Tamburello\r\n\nresigned  his   position  with   Comm-Tract  in  May   1993,  and\r\n\nsubsequently instituted this action.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n          Count  I  of Tamburello's  complaint  alleges that  the\r\n\nindividual  defendants conducted  the affairs  of  an enterprise,\r\n\nComm-Tract,  through   a  pattern  of  Hobbs   Act  extortion  of\r\n\nTamburello's property rights, in  violation of RICO, 18  U.S.C.  \r\n\n1962(c).    Count  II  alleges  that  the  individual  defendants\r\n\nconspired to violate RICO by knowingly joining the enterprise and\r\n\nby  committing,  or  agreeing to  commit  at  least  two acts  of\r\n\nracketeering.   Count  IV  alleges that  all defendants  violated\r\n\nTamburello's  rights under the MCRA.1  We address the RICO claims\r\n\nfirst.\r\n\nI.  The RICO Claims\r          I.  The RICO Claims\r                             \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Tamburello does  not appeal the district court's  dismissal of\r\nCounts III and V.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          Tamburello alleges that the  actions of his supervisors\r\n\nat Comm-Tract constituted  a pattern of extortion  to deprive him\r\n\nof his rights to speak out on union matters, his rights under the\r\n\ncollective-bargaining  agreement, and his right  to his job.  The\r\n\ndistrict court  held that Tamburello's RICO  claims are preempted\r\n\nby   the  NLRA,   which  \"pre-empts   state  and   federal  court\r\n\njurisdiction  to remedy  conduct  that is  arguably protected  or\r\n\nprohibited by the Act.\"  Amalgamated Ass'n of Street, Elec. Ry. &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nMotor  Coach Employees  v. Lockridge,  403 U.S.  274, 276  (1971)\r                                              \r\n\n(citing San Diego Bldg.  Trades Council v. Garmon, 359  U.S. 236,\r                                                           \r\n\n244 (1959)).\r\n\n          The NLRA \"is a comprehensive code passed by Congress to\r\n\nregulate labor relations  in activities affecting  interstate and\r\n\nforeign  commerce.\"  Nash v. Florida Indus. Comm'n, 389 U.S. 235,\r                                                            \r\n\n238 (1967).  The  NLRA reflects congressional intent to  create a\r\n\nuniform,  nationwide   body  of   labor  law  interpreted   by  a\r\n\ncentralized expert  agency -- the National  Labor Relations Board\r\n\n(NLRB).    Accordingly, the  NLRA  vests  the NLRB  with  primary\r\n\njurisdiction over unfair labor  practices.  See 29 U.S.C.    158.\r                                                         \r\n\nApplying these principles, the Garmon  Court held that \"[w]hen an\r                                               \r\n\nactivity  is arguably subject  to   7  or   8 of  the [NLRA], the\r\n\nStates as well as the federal courts  must defer to the exclusive\r\n\ncompetence of the National Labor Relations Board if the danger of\r\n\nstate  interference  with  national  policy is  to  be  averted.\"\r\n\nGarmon, 359 U.S. at 245.  The Court has interpreted  this to mean\r                \r\n\nthat, \"as a general  rule, neither state nor federal  courts have\r                                                                           \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\njurisdiction over  suits directly involving 'activity  [which] is\r                      \r\n\narguably subject to    7 or   8 of the Act.'\"  Vaca v.

A  primary   justification  of  the\r\n\npreemption doctrine is  \"the need to  avoid conflicting rules  of\r\n\nsubstantive law in the labor  relations area and the desirability\r\n\nof leaving  the development of  such rules to  the administrative\r\n\nagency created by Congress  for that purpose . . .  .\"  Vaca, 386\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at 180-81.2\r\n\n          The alleged  wrongful conduct in this  case is arguably\r\n\nprohibited by  the NLRA.   Section 8(a)(3)  of the NLRA  makes it\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  Although the Garmon doctrine, which is rooted in the Supremacy\r                                \r\nClause of  the United States  Constitution, U.S. Const.  art. VI,\r\ncl. 2, was originally concerned only with  federal supremacy over\r\nconflicting  state  laws,  it  has  been  extended  to  cover the\r                            \r\nrelationship between  the NLRA and  other federal statutes.   See\r                                                                           \r\nConnell Co. v.

See  Britt v.\r                                                                        \r\nGrocers Supply Co., Inc., 978 F.2d 1441, 1446-47 (5th Cir. 1992);\r                                  \r\nBoffa, 688  F.2d at 931-33.  The facts of this case are such that\r               \r\nwe need  not at this time  decide whether, or to  what extent, we\r\nagree with this proposition.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nunlawful  for an employer \"by discrimination in regard to hire or\r\n\ntenure of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any\r\n\nlabor organization.\"    29  U.S.C.    158(a)(3).    The  ultimate\r\n\nquestion   presented  by  Tamburello's   claims  is  whether  his\r\n\nsupervisors  at Comm-Tract intimidated,  coerced, threatened, and\r\n\nharassed him into quitting  his job in retaliation for  his union\r\n\nactivities as a union steward.   It is beyond dispute  that these\r\n\nallegations, if found to be true, would constitute a violation of\r\n\nthe NLRA.   See Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467  U.S. 883, 894 (1983)\r                                                \r\n\n(an  employer  violates   8(a)  (3)  \"when, for  the  purposes of\r\n\ndiscouraging  union  activity,  .  . .  it  purposefully  creates\r\n\nworking conditions so intolerable that the employee has no option\r\n\nbut  to  resign\").3    Unless an  exception  applies,  therefore,\r\n\nTamburello's  RICO  claims  are  subject to  the  NLRB's  primary\r\n\njurisdiction.\r\n\n          There are three generally  recognized exceptions to the\r\n\nNLRB's primary  jurisdiction.   The first is  where Congress  has\r\n\nexpressly  carved   out  an  exception  to   the  NLRB's  primary\r\n\njurisdiction.

Section 7 provides,  in pertinent part,  that employees\r\nshall  have the right to \"self-organization, to form, to join, or\r\nassist  labor  organizations,  to  bargain  collectively  through\r\nrepresentatives of  their own choosing,  and to  engage in  other\r\nconcerted activities for the  purpose of collective bargaining or\r\nother mutual aid or protection . . . .\"  29 U.S.C.   157.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nmade an  exception to the NLRB's primary  jurisdiction for claims\r\n\nalleging    extortion.

One  federal court  has  framed the  issue as\r\n\nfollows:\r\n\n            RICO should  be read  as  limited by  the\r\n            exclusive jurisdiction of  the NLRA  only\r\n            when  the   Court  would  be   forced  to\r\n            determine  whether  some  portion of  the\r\n            defendant's  conduct  violated labor  law\r\n            before  a  RICO  predicate act  would  be\r\n            established.   So  long as  the predicate\r\n            act  exists  independent  of  any  unfair\r\n            labor  practice  resolutions, the  NLRB's\r\n            exclusive  jurisdiction  is not  violated\r\n            since the  Court  will not  be forced  to\r\n            interpret   labor   law   except   as   a\r\n            collateral  matter.    However,   if  the\r\n            existence of the  predicate acts  depends\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n            wholly  upon  a   determination  that   a\r\n            violation of federal labor  law occurred,\r\n            jurisdiction is preempted.\r\n\nMHC  v.

Similarly, we have  held, in the\r\n\ncontext of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.  \r\n\n2000e  et seq., that the NLRA  is the exclusive remedy for claims\r\n\n\"which  hinge  on  an  unfair labor  practice  having  occurred.\"\r\n\nMorgan, 901 F.2d at 194.\r                \r\n\n          Like  Tamburello,  the  plaintiff  in  Brennan  alleged\r                                                                  \r\n\nextortion  as  a  predicate  RICO  act.    In  holding  that  the\r\n\nplaintiff's RICO extortion claim  was \"preempted\" (see supra n.2)\r                                                                      \r\n\nby the NLRA, the Eighth Circuit court noted that 18 U.S.C.   1951\r\n\n(1988)  is a  generic  law prohibiting  extortion,4 and  reasoned\r\n\nthat the  court was therefore forced to look to the labor laws to\r\n\ndefine  the alleged  illegal  conduct.   Because the  defendant's\r\n\nconduct  was illegal, if at all, only  by virtue of the NLRA, the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  18 U.S.C.   1951 provides:\r\n\n               (a)  Whoever  in  any  way  or  degree\r\n            obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or\r\n            the movement of any article  or commodity\r\n            in commerce, by  robbery or extortion  or\r\n            attempts  or  conspires   so  to  do,  or\r\n            commits or threatens physical violence to\r\n            any  person or property in furtherance of\r\n            a  plan  or  purpose  to  do  anything in\r\n            violation of this section shall  be fined\r\n            not more than  $10,000 or imprisoned  not\r\n            more than twenty years, or both.\r\n\n   RICO defines  \"extortion\" as  \"the obtaining of  property from\r\nanother, with his consent,  induced by wrongful use of  actual or\r\nthreatened force, violence,  or fear, or under color  of official\r\nright.\"  18 U.S.C.   1951(b)(2).\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\ncourt  concluded  that the  NLRB  had  exclusive jurisdiction  to\r\n\nresolve what was, at its essence, an unfair labor practice claim.\r\n\nSee Brennan, 973 F.2d at 647.\r                     \r\n\n          For reasons  similar to those expressed  in Brennan, we\r                                                                       \r\n\nconclude  that the  unfair  labor practice  issues implicated  by\r\n\nTamburello's  complaint are  not  merely collateral  to his  RICO\r\n\nclaims.5  Tamburello alleges  that his supervisors placed  him on\r\n\nthe  less desirable  work  assignments, reduced  his chances  for\r\n\novertime  pay,   made  him  take   a  forced  vacation   or  face\r\n\ntermination, took away his  company vehicle, and made threatening\r\n\nanti-union activities, all to coerce him into giving up his union\r\n\nsteward position,  and, eventually,  to resign his  position with\r\n\nComm-Tract.  The problem  is that none of this alleged conduct is\r\n\nillegal without  reference  to the  NLRA.   It is  the NLRA  that\r\n\nprohibits employers from  creating intolerable working conditions\r\n\nto discourage union activities, see 29  U.S.C.   158(a)(3); Sure-\r                                                                           \r\n\nTan, 467  U.S. 894, and it is the NLRA that prohibits an employer\r             \r\n\nfrom interfering with  an employee's  right to join  a union  and\r\n\nengage  in concerted  activities for  mutual aid  and protection.\r\n\nSee 29 U.S.C.    158(a)(1), 157.  Indeed, one would  presume that\r             \r\n\nCongress passed  the NLRA, at  least in  part, precisely  because\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5    We  note also  that,  in a  general  sense,  claims alleging\r\nemployer retaliation  for  protected  union  activities  are  not\r\nmerely a peripheral concern of the NLRA.  As indicated above, the\r\nconduct alleged in this case would, if true, constitute an unfair\r\nlabor  practice under the  NLRA.   The authority  of the  NLRB to\r\nremedy unfair labor practices is central to its purpose.  NLRB v.\r                                                                        \r\nState of Illinois Dept. of Employment Security, 988 F.2d 735, 739\r                                                        \r\n(7th Cir. 1993).\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nconduct  such  as  that  complained  of  by  Tamburello  was  not\r\n\ntheretofore prohibited.  We thus  agree with the district court's\r\n\nconclusion that  \"the alleged conduct that  led to [Tamburello's]\r\n\ntermination  of employment is illegal  only by reference to union\r\n\nactivities.\"\r\n\n          In order to determine whether plaintiff has established\r\n\na RICO predicate act, a reviewing court would be forced to decide\r\n\nwhether  some portion  of  the defendant's  conduct violated  the\r\n\nfederal  labor laws.   Because  plaintiff's claim  hinges upon  a\r\n\ndetermination of  whether an unfair labor  practice has occurred,\r\n\nwe  conclude  that his  RICO claims  are  subject to  the primary\r\n\njurisdiction of the NLRB.6\r\n\n          As  a  final  matter,   we  will  briefly  address  two\r\n\nadditional  arguments  proffered  by   the  plaintiff.     First,\r\n\nTamburello  contends   that  the  NLRA  does  not  apply  to  his\r\n\nallegations at all because  his RICO claims are  asserted against\r\n\nthe  individual defendants,  and  not the  \"employer\" within  the\r\n\nmeaning  of the NLRA.  The NLRA expressly provides, however, that\r\n\n\"[t]he  term 'employer' includes any person acting as an agent of\r\n\nan employer,  directly or indirectly.\"  29  U.S.C.   152(2).  The\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6   We note  that the question  of whether a  labor law  issue is\r\ncollateral to issues raised  by a claim under another  statute is\r\nan  intensely fact  driven inquiry.    The focus  must be  on the\r\nparticular  allegations of the plaintiff's complaint to determine\r\nwhether  any or  all  of  the  claims  may  be  resolved  without\r\ndetermination of  questions of federal  labor law.   In addition,\r\n\"[i]t is the conduct being regulated,  not the formal description\r\nof  governing  legal  standards,  that  is  the  proper focus  of\r\nconcern.\"   Motor Coach Employees v.

See American Press,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc. v.

We therefore\r                               \r\n\nreject  Tamburello's argument that the NLRA does not apply to his\r\n\nRICO claims.\r\n\n          Second, Tamburello  strains to fit his  case within the\r\n\nexception to Garmon granted  suits alleging a breach of  the duty\r                             \r\n\nof  fair representation under   9(a) of the NLRA.

As explained\r                                 \r\n\nabove,  the  alleged  conduct  of  Tamburello's  supervisors   is\r\n\narguably subject to    8(a)(3)  of the NLRA,  which prohibits  an\r\n\nemployer from discriminating against an employee on  the basis of\r\n\nunion status,  and also to    8(a)(1).   As with the  RICO claim,\r\n\ntherefore, the question is whether any of the three exceptions to\r\n\nGarmon preemption  apply.   The  first  and third  exceptions  do\r                \r\n\nnot;7 we address the second exception below.\r\n\n          Garmon preemption  does not apply  when the  underlying\r                          \r\n\nregulated activity  touches \"interests so deeply  rooted in local\r\n\nfeeling  and responsibility  that, in  the absence  of compelling\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7   The first exception -- whether Congress has explicitly carved\r\nout  an  exception to  the  NLRB's exclusive  jurisdiction  -- is\r\ninapplicable to Tamburello's state  law claims.  With respect  to\r\nthe third  exception, we  concluded above  that the  unfair labor\r\npractice issues  implicated  by Tamburello's  complaint  are  not\r\nmerely collateral to his RICO claims.  For the same reasons, they\r\nare  not merely  collateral  to  his  MCRA  claims.    The  third\r\nexception therefore does not apply.\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\ncongressional direction,\"  courts \"could not infer  that Congress\r\n\nhad deprived the States  of the power to  act.\"  Sears,  Roebuck,\r                                                                          \r\n\n436  U.S. at  195 (quoting  Garmon 359  U.S. at  244).   In cases\r                                            \r\n\nwhere, as here,  the underlying conduct is arguably prohibited by\r                                                                        \r\n\nthe  NLRA,   the  Court  has  identified   two  prerequisites  to\r\n\napplication of the \"local interests\" exception.  First, the state\r\n\nmust have a significant  interest in protecting the  citizen from\r\n\nthe challenged conduct.   Second, the controversy which  could be\r\n\npresented  to the state court  must be different  from that which\r\n\ncould have been  presented to the NLRB.  Sears, Roebuck, 436 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 196-97.  As the Court explained:\r\n\n               The  critical  inquiry, therefore,  is\r\n            not whether the State  is enforcing a law\r\n            relating specifically  to labor relations\r\n            or one of general application but whether\r\n            the  controversy  presented to  the state\r\n            court is identical to  . . . or different\r\n            from .  . .  that which could  have been,\r\n            but  was  not,  presented  to  the  Labor\r\n            Board.   For  it  is only  in the  former\r\n            situation that a  state court's  exercise\r\n            of  jurisdiction  necessarily involves  a\r\n            risk  of  interference  with  the  unfair\r\n            labor practice jurisdiction of  the Board\r\n            which the arguably  prohibited branch  of\r\n            the  Garmon  doctrine  was   designed  to\r                                 \r\n            avoid.\r\n\nId. at 197.\r            \r\n\n          We assume,  arguendo, that the state  has a significant\r                                        \r\n\ninterest in  protecting an  employee from  the harassment  of his\r\n\nsupervisors in retaliation  for his union  activities.  We  agree\r\n\nwith the district court, however, that \"Plaintiff's [MCRA] claims\r\n\nraise  the same  question as would  be asked  in an  unfair labor\r\n\npractice  proceeding,  namely, whether  [his  supervisors] placed\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nplaintiff on less desirable work assignments, reduced his chances\r\n\nfor overtime pay, and  harassed him in retaliation for  his union\r\n\nactivities.\"  \r\n\nBecause the controversy which would be presented to a state court\r\n\nis identical to that which would  be presented to the NLRB, there\r\n\nis a significant risk of state interference with the unfair labor\r\n\npractice  of  the  NLRB.    Under   Garmon  and  Sears,  Roebuck,\r                                                                          \r\n\nTamburello's MCRA claims are therefore preempted by the NLRA.\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\r\n\ncourt is affirmed.\r                   affirmed\r                           \r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n",

We thus  agree with the district court's\r\n\nconclusion that  \"the alleged conduct that  led to [Tamburello's]\r\n\ntermination  of employment is illegal  only by reference to union\r\n\nactivities.\"\r\n\n          In order to determine whether plaintiff has established\r\n\na RICO predicate act, a reviewing court would be forced to decide\r\n\nwhether  some portion  of  the defendant's  conduct violated  the\r\n\nfederal  labor laws.   Because  plaintiff's claim  hinges upon  a\r\n\ndetermination of  whether an unfair labor  practice has occurred,\r\n\nwe  conclude  that his  RICO claims  are  subject to  the primary\r\n\njurisdiction of the NLRB.6\r\n\n          As  a  final  matter,   we  will  briefly  address  two\r\n\nadditional  arguments  proffered  by   the  plaintiff.     First,\r\n\nTamburello  contends   that  the  NLRA  does  not  apply  to  his\r\n\nallegations at all because  his RICO claims are  asserted against\r\n\nthe  individual defendants,  and  not the  \"employer\" within  the\r\n\nmeaning  of the NLRA.

The focus  must be  on the\r\nparticular  allegations of the plaintiff's complaint to determine\r\nwhether  any or  all  of  the  claims  may  be  resolved  without\r\ndetermination of  questions of federal  labor law.

As explained\r                                 \r\n\nabove,  the  alleged  conduct  of  Tamburello's  supervisors   is\r\n\narguably subject to    8(a)(3)  of the NLRA,  which prohibits  an\r\n\nemployer from discriminating against an employee on  the basis of\r\n\nunion status,  and also to    8(a)(1).   As with the  RICO claim,\r\n\ntherefore, the question is whether any of the three exceptions to\r\n\nGarmon preemption  apply.   The  first  and third  exceptions  do\r                \r\n\nnot;7 we address the second exception below.\r\n\n          Garmon preemption  does not apply  when the  underlying\r                          \r\n\nregulated activity  touches \"interests so deeply  rooted in local\r\n\nfeeling  and responsibility  that, in  the absence  of compelling\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7   The first exception -- whether Congress has explicitly carved\r\nout  an  exception to  the  NLRB's exclusive  jurisdiction  -- is\r\ninapplicable to Tamburello's state  law claims.  With respect  to\r\nthe third  exception, we  concluded above  that the  unfair labor\r\npractice issues  implicated  by Tamburello's  complaint  are  not\r\nmerely collateral to his RICO claims.

As the Court explained:\r\n\n               The  critical  inquiry, therefore,  is\r\n            not whether the State  is enforcing a law\r\n            relating specifically  to labor relations\r\n            or one of general application but whether\r\n            the  controversy  presented to  the state\r\n            court is identical to  . . . or different\r\n            from .  . .  that which could  have been,\r\n            but  was  not,  presented  to  the  Labor\r\n            Board.   For  it  is only  in the  former\r\n            situation that a  state court's  exercise\r\n            of  jurisdiction  necessarily involves  a\r\n            risk  of  interference  with  the  unfair\r\n            labor practice jurisdiction of  the Board\r\n            which the arguably  prohibited branch  of\r\n            the  Garmon  doctrine  was   designed  to\r                                 \r\n            avoid.\r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 197.\r</span><pre class=\"inline\">            \r\n\n          We assume,  arguendo, that the state  has a significant\r                                        \r\n\ninterest in  protecting an  employee from  the harassment  of his\r\n\nsupervisors in retaliation  for his union  activities.  We  agree\r\n\nwith the district court, however, that \"Plaintiff's [MCRA] claims\r\n\nraise  the same  question as would  be asked  in an  unfair labor\r\n\npractice  proceeding,  namely, whether  [his  supervisors] placed\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nplaintiff on less desirable work assignments, reduced his chances\r\n\nfor overtime pay, and  harassed him in retaliation for  his union\r\n\nactivities.\"  \r\n\nBecause the controversy which would be presented to a state court\r\n\nis identical to that which would  be presented to the NLRB, there\r\n\nis a significant risk of state interference with the unfair labor\r\n\npractice  of  the  NLRB.
