We agree with  the district court that\r                                \r\n\nappellant  had   no  business  bringing  this   case  in  the\r\n\nMassachusetts  district  court.     Whatever  thin  technical\r\n\narguments could be made in favor of personal jurisdiction and\r\n\nvenue in Massachusetts, appellant's  counsel had to know that\r\n\nthis case would be dismissed or transferred to Virginia since\r\n\nit  had ample contacts with  Virginia and virtually none with\r\n\nMassachusetts.  Indeed,  counsel acknowledged  that the  case\r\n\nwas  likely  to  be  transferred  to  Virginia  even  if  the\r\n\ntechnical arguments prevailed.\r\n\n          Under these circumstances, we think  that dismissal\r\n\nrather  than  transfer  was  a permissible  choice  and  that\r\n\nsanctions of $1,000 jointly  and $1,000 against counsel alone\r\n\nwere appropriate.  We prefer  to rest our affirmance entirely\r\n\non Fed.  R. Civ. P.  11(b)(1) (improper purpose)  rather than\r\n\n11(b)(2)   (frivolous  legal   contentions)   but   have   no\r\n\ndisagreement  whatever as to  the total amount.   The request\r\n\nfor  further sanctions  on appeal  is denied, but  counsel is\r\n\ncautioned against a repetition of such conduct.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
