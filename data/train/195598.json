Defendant-appellant,\n                                         \n\nH ctor  M.  Carrillo,  appeals  his conviction  for  robbing  and\n\nplacing  the life of  a postal inspector  in jeopardy  by using a\n\ndangerous  weapon.  Carrillo bases his appeal on two grounds.  He\n\nargues that his conviction violates the Double Jeopardy Clause of\n\nthe Fifth Amendment and  that it resulted from the  inappropriate\n\nadmission of prejudicial evidence  by the trial court.   Carrillo\n\nalso appeals the sentence imposed by the district court following\n\nhis conviction.   Concluding that Carrillo's  conviction does not\n\nviolate the Double  Jeopardy Clause and  that the district  court\n\ncommitted no error in  admitting evidence during the trial  or in\n\nimposing the sentence, we affirm. \n\n                                I.\n\n                       Factual Background \n                                         \n\n          We recount  the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nthe prosecution.  United States v. Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d 1026, 1028\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (citing United States v. Alvarez, 987 F.2d 77, 79\n                                                \n\n(1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 147 (1993)).  The facts\n                             \n\nare to  the effect that on  July 27, 1992, at  approximately 8:30\n\np.m.,  Ivette  O'Neill, a  United  States  Postal Inspector,  was\n\ndriving home from work  in a government vehicle assigned  to her.\n\nInspector  O'Neill was  on twenty-four  hour call  and  carried a\n\ngovernment issued beeper, cellular phone,  and car radio.   While\n\nstopped at  an intersection, a man  approached Inspector O'Neill,\n\nput a revolver to the left side of her head, told her that he was\n\nholding  her up, and  ordered her to  exit the vehicle.   The man\n\n                              - 2 -\n\nthen drove off with  the car.  As soon as he drove off, Inspector\n\nO'Neill  telephoned  the postal  office  to  inform them  of  the\n\nrobbery.   She  also informed  the robber,  via the  stolen car's\n\nradio, that the vehicle  he had taken was a  vehicle belonging to\n\nthe United  States  and that  his  action constituted  a  federal\n\noffense.  The day after the robbery, the stolen vehicle was found\n\nin a  parking lot near appellant's residence and not far from the\n\nintersection at which the  robbery had taken place.   The vehicle\n\nwas in a  disheveled, dismantled  state.  A  bulletproof vest,  a\n\ncellular telephone,  a radio, a narcotics kit,  and the vehicle's\n\nblue emergency revolving lights  were missing from the car.   The\n\npostal  inspector  assigned  to  investigate  the  case  received\n\ninformation that shortly after  the incident, the appellant, also\n\nknown as \"El Roquero,\"  had attempted to sell a  blue bulletproof\n\nvest  in the neighborhood where Inspector O'Neill was robbed.  It\n\nwas also  discovered that appellant had  previously been arrested\n\nby  Puerto Rico  police  and charged  with the  theft of  a motor\n\nvehicle.   The postal  inspector obtained  appellant's photograph\n\nfrom the Puerto Rico police department and prepared a photospread\n\nwith the purpose of showing it to Inspector O'Neill.   The postal\n\ninspector showed  Inspector O'Neill  the photospread on  November\n\n12, 1992,  and  she  identified appellant  as  her  assailant  by\n\npicking  out  his  photograph  from  among  the   others  in  the\n\nphotospread.\n\n          On November 25, 1992,  a Federal Grand Jury  returned a\n\ntrue bill against the appellant.  He was arraigned on December 2,\n\n                              - 3 -\n\n1992, and entered a  plea of not guilty as to all three counts in\n\nthe  indictment.   The three-count  indictment charged  appellant\n\nwith  unlawfully  assaulting,   resisting,  opposing,   impeding,\n\nintimidating or interfering with Postal Inspector  Ivette O'Neill\n\nwhile she  was engaged in her official duties and with the use of\n\na revolver.   The indictment  further charged the  appellant with\n\nthe  theft of the United  States Postal vehicle  which was within\n\nthe lawful charge, custody and control of Inspector O'Neill.  \n\n          A  jury trial commenced on  January 8, 1993.   The case\n\nwas submitted  to the  jury at around  noon on January  12, 1994;\n\nhowever, about five hours later the jury sent a note to the judge\n\ninforming  him that they  were unable to  reach a verdict.   Upon\n\nreceipt of the  jury's note,  the judge called  the jury and  the\n\nparties into the courtroom.   The judge then instructed  the jury\n\nthat  they need not agree on all counts charged in the indictment\n\nand that they  might wish to consider whether they  agreed on one\n\nor more counts.  The judge instructed the  jury to go back to the\n\njury room for further deliberation.   At approximately 6:15 p.m.,\n\nhowever, the jury sent the judge a second note informing him that\n\nthey were unable  to reach a  verdict.1  Before calling  the jury\n\nback  into the  courtroom,  the judge  summoned  counsel for  the\n\nparties  to ask for their suggestions on the matter.  Appellant's\n\ncounsel  asked the court to  declare a mistrial.   The government\n\nopposed the  request for a  mistrial, and suggested  instead that\n\n                    \n\n1   The note read:   \"Your  honor, honestly it  is impossible  to\nreach a verdict.\" \n\n                              - 4 -\n\nthe  jury be  allowed to go  home and  return in  the morning for\n\nfurther deliberations.  Counsel for the government also suggested\n\nthat the jury be given an  \"Allen\" charge.  The judge agreed that\n\nan \"Allen\" charge could  prove helpful.  However, when  the judge\n\ncalled  the jury and asked  them whether they  thought they could\n\nreach a  verdict if allowed  to go home and  return the following\n\nmorning, the foreperson responded  in the negative.  The  rest of\n\nthe jurors agreed with him by raising their hand.  The judge then\n\ngranted the mistrial requested by the appellant and dismissed the\n\njury.  Immediately thereafter, and before discharging counsel for\n\nthe parties, the judge set a new trial for thirteen days later.\n\n          On January 20, 1993, five days before the new trial was\n\nscheduled  to  begin,  appellant  filed  a  motion  of  acquittal\n\npursuant  to  Rule  29(c)  of  the  Federal   Rules  of  Criminal\n\nProcedure.2   In his motion,  appellant argued that  the evidence\n\n                    \n\n2  Rule 29(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides\nas follows:\n\n            If the  jury returns a verdict  of guilty\n            or is discharged without  having returned\n            a  verdict,  a  motion  for  judgment  of\n            acquittal may be made or renewed within 7\n            days  after the  jury  is  discharged  or\n            within such further time as the court may\n            fix  during  the  7-day  period.    If  a\n            verdict of guilty  is returned the  court\n            may on such motion set aside the  verdict\n            and enter  judgment of acquittal.   If no\n            verdict is returned  the court may  enter\n            judgment of acquittal.   It shall not  be\n            necessary to  the making of such a motion\n            that a similar motion has been made prior\n            to  the submission  of  the  case to  the\n            jury.\n\n                              - 5 -\n\npresented at  trial was insufficient for a  conviction and argued\n\nthat a  retrial was  proscribed by  the Fifth  Amendment's Double\n\nJeopardy  Clause.  In  the event that the  trial court decided to\n\ndeny  his motion, the appellant  asked the court  to postpone the\n\njury trial  so that he  could have  an opportunity to  appeal the\n\ndenial  of  his  motion.    The  trial  court  did  not  rule  on\n\nappellant's  motion  until the  day  of the  commencement  of the\n\nsecond  trial.   After  entertaining  counsel's  argument on  the\n\nsubject out of the presence of  the jury, the court made a ruling\n\nfrom  the  bench denying  appellant's  motion  for acquittal  and\n\nfinding that the government had presented sufficient evidence for\n\na  conviction.  The court  also denied appellant's  request for a\n\ncontinuance  of the trial.   The trial commenced  as scheduled on\n\nJanuary 25,  1993, and lasted three  days.  On the  second day of\n\ntrial, at  the conclusion of the government's case, the appellant\n\nmade  a  new motion  for judgment  of  acquittal which  the court\n\ndenied.  The case was  submitted to the jury on the  third day of\n\ntrial.   The jury delivered its  verdict on the  same day finding\n\nthe appellant not guilty on counts one and two of the indictment,\n\nbut guilty on count three.  After asking for an  extension, which\n\nthe  court  granted,  the  appellant  filed  a  final motion  for\n\n                    \n\nAppellant  filed  his  motion  eight  days  after  the  jury  was\ndischarged; however,  his motion was  timely as the  7-day period\nbegan to run on January 13 and intermediate weekends are excluded\nfrom the computation of a seven-day period.  See United States v.\n                                                                 \nCastro-Lara,  970 F.2d 976 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, Sarraff\n                                                                 \nv. United States, 113 S. Ct. 2935 (1993). \n                \n\n                              - 6 -\n\njudgment of acquittal  on February  22, 1993.   The court  denied\n\nappellant's motion on April 16, 1993.  \n\n          On May 14, 1993, the court sentenced the appellant to a\n\nterm  of  imprisonment of  121 months  and  a term  of supervised\n\nrelease of fiveyears.  This appealwas timely filedon May 20,1993.\n\n                               II.\n\n                            Discussion\n                                      \n\n          A.  The Double Jeopardy Claim\n                                       \n\n          Appellant assigns error to  the trial court's denial of\n\nhis motion for judgment  of acquittal filed after the  first jury\n\nhad been  discharged, but before  the commencement of  the second\n\ntrial.3  Appellant  does not ask us to  review the correctness of\n\nthe trial court's decision  to deny his motion of  acquittal, but\n\ninstead asks us to vacate  his conviction as he alleges that  his\n\nsecond  trial violated  the Double  Jeopardy Clause of  the Fifth\n\nAmendment.  Appellant  argues that  the second trial  put him  in\n\ndouble  jeopardy  because  he  was  entitled  to  a  judgment  of\n\nacquittal at the end of  the first trial.  Pitching  his argument\n\non Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1 (1978), he  argues that the\n                         \n\ntrial  court's  failure to  recognize  the  insufficiency of  the\n\n                    \n\n3  Appellant made six motions for judgment of acquittal.  He made\nhis  first one  on  January 11,  1993, at  the conclusion  of the\ngovernment's case in the  first trial; his second one  on January\n12, 1993,  at the conclusion of  the defense's case  in the first\ntrial; his third one  on January 29, 1993, after the discharge of\nthe jury  in the first trial; his fourth one on January 26, 1993,\nat the conclusion of  the government's case in the  second trial;\nhis fifth  one on  January  27, 1993,  at the  conclusion of  the\ndefense's  case; and, his sixth  one on February  22, 1993, after\nthe discharge of the jury in the second trial.            \n\n                              - 7 -\n\nevidence  presented against him in the first trial and to provide\n\nhim  with an opportunity to appeal the court's denial allowed the\n\ngovernment  to \"take two  bites out  of the  apple\" and  obtain a\n\nconviction  against him which it  could not have  obtained at the\n\nfirst trial.  \n\n          In essence, appellant  argues that the  Double Jeopardy\n\nClause  precluded his  second  trial due  to  the fact  that  the\n\ngovernment failed  to present  enough evidence to  convict during\n\nthe  first trial.    Specifically, appellant  asserts that  under\n\nBurks he was entitled to have a reviewing court examine the trial\n     \n\ncourt's denial  of his motion  of acquittal for  insufficiency of\n\nthe evidence.  The petitioner in Burks had claimed insanity as  a\n                                      \n\ndefense  to a bank robbery  count at trial,  but was nevertheless\n\nconvicted by the jury after the trial court denied his motion for\n\na judgment of acquittal.   Burks appealed his conviction  arguing\n\nthat the trial court had erred in denying his motion for judgment\n\nof  acquittal.   The  Court of  Appeals  for the  Sixth  Circuit,\n\nholding  that the  prosecution had  failed to  present sufficient\n\nevidence to rebut petitioner's proof as to insanity, reversed and\n\nremanded the case to the trial court with directions to determine\n\nwhether  judgment of acquittal should  be entered or  a new trial\n\nordered.   The  Supreme Court  granted certiorari  and  held that\n\ndouble  jeopardy had  attached at  the moment  that the  court of\n\nappeals  determined  that  the  prosecution   had  not  presented\n\nsufficient  evidence  to convict  at  the first  trial  and that,\n\n                              - 8 -\n\ntherefore,  the court of appeals should have entered or ordered a\n\njudgment of acquittal.\n\n          A defendant  in a  criminal proceeding is  protected by\n\nthe  Double  Jeopardy  Clause  against  multiple punishments  and\n\nrepeated  prosecutions for the  same offense.   United  States v.\n                                                                 \n\nDinitz,  424 U.S. 600 (1976) (citing United States v. Wilson, 420\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 332 (1975));  North Carolina  v. Pearce, 395  U.S. 711,  717\n                                            \n\n(1969).  However, the Double  Jeopardy Clause is  not an absolute\n\nbar  to successive trials.  Justices of Boston Municipal Court v.\n                                                                 \n\nLydon,  466 U.S.  294 (1984).   \"The  protection embodied  in the\n     \n\nDouble Jeopardy Clause is  a personal defense that may  be waived\n\nor  foreclosed by  a  defendant's voluntary  actions or  choices,\n\nincluding  a request  for or  effectual consent  to  a mistrial.\"\n\nUnited  States v. Aguilar-Aranceta,  957 F.2d 18,  21 (1st Cir.),\n                                  \n\ncert. denied, Aguilar-Aranceta v.  United States, 113 S.

If  a  mistrial  is declared  at  the  request  of  the\n\ndefendant,  the defendant  is deemed  to have  waived any  double\n\njeopardy claim he might otherwise have.  Id.\n                                           \n\n          The  appellant moved  for a  mistrial after  the jurors\n\ninformed  the  trial court  for the  second  time that  they were\n\nunable to reach a  verdict.  During oral argument before  us, the\n\nappellant argued  that he  had no choice  but to  consent to  the\n\ndeclaration  of a mistrial.  The record, however, does not reveal\n\na grudging consent by the appellant.  On the contrary, the record\n\nshows  that the appellant asked for a mistrial almost immediately\n\n                              - 9 -\n\nafter  the  court elicited  suggestions  from counsel  on  how to\n\nrespond  to the jury's second  note informing the  court of their\n\ninability  to  reach a  verdict.4    Before granting  appellant's\n\n                    \n\n4    The exchange  between  the  court and  the  parties was,  in\nrelevant part, as follows:\n\n            THE COURT:   Okay.

They\n            have  not  been  deliberating  that  long\n            considering  that the trial  did begin on\n            Friday.\n\n            THE COURT:   Well, the case was submitted\n            about twelve noon.\n\n            [PROSECUTOR]:    That  is  correct,  your\n            Honor. \n\n            [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  Your honor, this is a\n            very   short  case.     They   have  been\n            deliberating  more  and  they have  taken\n            longer  than has  taken the  testimony of\n            the witnesses.  More than six hours  they\n            have been deliberating.   I believe it is\n            impossible  to  reach  an  agreement.   I\n            believe the jury should be  excused and a\n            hung jury  -- no verdict be entered, your\n            Honor, because honestly this case started\n            at  noon during  the afternoon  on Friday\n            with  only  one  testimony,   after  2:00\n            o'clock because you were attending  a TRO\n            in another case.  For less than two hours\n            the witness where testifying.  All in all\n            he --  in the whole case  it hasn't taken\n            six hours complete  of testimony for  the\n            jury.   They -- said it  is impossible to\n            reach an agreement.  No, the case is very\n            short.   I think that the  jury should be\n\n                              - 10 -\n\nmotion for a mistrial,  the court advised the appellant  that the\n\ncase would have to be retried.  Appellant's counsel confirmed his\n\nunderstanding of this fact by stating:  \"I know that, your Honor.\n\nI know that we have to start again,  yes, your Honor\".  Thus, the\n\nrecord  reflects  not  only  that  the  appellant  requested  the\n                                                            \n\nmistrial but  that he expressly  consented to a  new trial.   The\n\ndouble jeopardy claim was waived.\n\n          Even if  the double jeopardy claim  had been preserved,\n\nit could  not have succeeded.  A  retrial following a \"hung jury\"\n\ndoes  not  violate the  Double  Jeopardy Clause.    Richardson v.\n                                                                 \n\nUnited  States,  468 U.S.  317, 324  (1984)  (citing to  Logan v.\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States, 144 U.S. 263, 297-98 (1892)).\n             \n\n          B.  Jury Access to the Photospread\n                                            \n\n          Appellant  argues  that  the  trial   court  improperly\n\npermitted  jury access,  during deliberations,  to a  photospread\n\nwhich included a \"mugshot\" taken of  appellant in connection with\n\na  previous  arrest.   The  photospread  had  been admitted  into\n\nevidence  over appellant's objection.   The photospread consisted\n\nof  black  and  white  photographs  of  six  males  including the\n\nappellant.  The photographs had been sandwiched between cardboard\n\npaper so that  only the faces were visible.  The photographs were\n\nstapled together so that the six faces were arranged in a circle.\n\nIt  was  the  same  photospread  shown  to Inspector  O'Neill  on\n\nNovember 12, 1992, when she first identified the appellant as her\n\nassailant.  The government  offered it into evidence  to buttress\n\n                    \n\n            dismissed, your Honor, very honestly.\n\n                              - 11 -\n\nInspector  O'Neill's identification, which was heatedly contested\n\nat both trials.  Appellant claims that the trial  court committed\n\nreversible  error by allowing the jurors  to take the photospread\n\nwith them  during their  deliberations.   Allowing the jurors  to\n\ntake the photospread was tantamount, the appellant argues, to the\n\nimpermissible  admission into  evidence of \"other  acts\" evidence\n\ncontrary to  Rule 404(b) of the  Federal Rules of  Evidence.  The\n\nappellant essentially speculates that the jury could have gleaned\n\nthat his photograph  was a  \"mugshot,\" from which  it might  have\n\ninferred that  he had  a prior criminal  record.  Aside  from its\n\nspeculative  nature, appellant's contention  is precluded  by his\n\nfailure to  see to it that  the photospread was made  part of the\n\nappellate record.    Effective  appellate  review  is  impossible\n\nwithout  it.  Second, appellant failed to raise the present claim\n\nin  the district  court.   We will  not consider  arguments never\n\npresented to the trial court.  United States v. Lebon,  4 F.3d 1,\n                                                     \n\n2  (1st   Cir.  1993).5     Finally,  during   closing  argument,\n\nappellant's   counsel  invited  the   jury  to  view  appellant's\n\nphotograph  in  the  photospread  and  compare  it  to  a written\n\nstatement  made by  Inspector O'Neill.   In  so doing,  appellant\n\nsought to emphasize the  alleged discrepancies between  Inspector\n\n                    \n\n5    Although  appellant  objected   to  the  admission  of   the\nphotospread into  evidence, the  court  overruled the  objection.\nJurors  generally  are  entitled  to  examine  exhibits  properly\nadmitted into evidence.  United States v. De Coito, 764 F.2d 690,\n                                                  \n695 (9th Cir. 1985); see also United States  v. Jackson, 477 F.2d\n                                                       \n879, 880 (8th Cir. 1973); Dallago v. United States, 427 F.2d 546,\n                                                  \n553   (D.C.  Cir.  1969).    Appellant  did  not  object  to  the\nphotospread going to the jury room.\n\n                              - 12 -\n\nO'Neill's written  description of  her assailant  and appellant's\n\nphotograph in the  photospread.  Thus, in  myriad ways, appellant\n\nwaived any claim that  the jury was improperly allowed  access to\n\nthe photospread during its deliberations.\n\n          We  do not read appellant's claim as a challenge to the\n\nadmission  of the photospread into evidence.  However, even if it\n\nwere read to encompass  such an indirect challenge, we  would not\n\nfind  reversible error.  In objecting at trial, the appellant did\n\nnot rely on Rule 404(b).  Indeed,  he failed to state a basis for\n\nthe objection.  Unless  the basis for objection is  apparent from\n\nthe context, the grounds  for objection must be specific  so that\n\nthe  trial court  may have  an opportunity  to address  the claim\n\nlater  sought  to  be presented  on  appeal.

However,\n\nnothing in  appellant's line  of questioning indicated  a concern\n\nthat  the   admission  of  the  photospread   was  equivalent  to\n\nintroducing  \"prior bad acts\"  evidence.   Rather, the  voir dire\n                                                                 \n\nexamination  was  aimed at  establishing  that Inspector  O'Neill\n\ncould not have made  an adequate identification of  her assailant\n\nin the first instance  because the photographs were not  in color\n\nand the visible portions of the photographs were too small.   The\n\nvoir dire examination established  that Inspector O'Neill was not\n         \n\nable to ascertain  her assailant's height, skin  tone, eye color,\n\nor  hair color from the photographs  included in the photospread.\n\nAt the conclusion of  the voir dire examination, the  court asked\n                                   \n\nappellant  whether  he  objected.   Appellant  responded  in  the\n\naffirmative  without elaboration,  and  the  court overruled  the\n\nobjection.\n\n          Thus,  since  appellant  failed  to  state  a  specific\n\nobjection  based on Rule 404(b),  and no such  basis of objection\n\ncould be considered clear  from the context, the trial  court was\n\ngiven no opportunity to address  any concerns the appellant might\n\nhave had regarding unfair  prejudice resulting from the admission\n\nof  the  photospread  into   evidence.    Consequently,  even  if\n\nappellant's present claim were construed as an indirect attack on\n\nthe trial court's evidentiary ruling, we would review it only for\n\nplain error.  United States v.

Second,\n            the   district   court  must   weigh  the\n            probative  value  of  the   \"other  acts\"\n            evidence against any unfair  prejudice to\n            the  defendant; and it  is only  when the\n            risk of  unfair prejudice \"substantially\"\n            outweighs  its  probative value  that the\n            evidence is to be excluded.\n\nUnited  States v.

However,\n                 \n\nbecause there is grave  risk of prejudice in the  introduction of\n\nphotographs such  as \"mugshots\", we  have adopted a  three factor\n\nanalysis    specifically    tailored    to   determining    their\n\nadmissibility.   See United States  v. Cannon, 903  F.2d 849, 855\n                                             \n\n(1st  Cir.), cert. denied, Cannon v.

Fosher,\n                                                                \n\n568 F.2d 207, 215 (1st Cir. 1978), are:\n\n            1.   The   government    must   have    a\n            demonstrable   need   to  introduce   the\n            photograph; \n\n            2. The photographs  themselves, if  shown\n            to the  jury,  must not  imply  that  the\n            defendant  has  a prior  criminal record;\n            and \n\n                              - 15 -\n\n            3.  The manner  of introduction  at trial\n            must  be  such  that  it  does  not  draw\n            particular  attention  to  the source  or\n            implications of the photograph.\n\nId.   Thus, in reviewing a trial court's admission of \"mugshots\",\n  \n\nwe examine not only what was submitted, but why and how.  Cannon,\n                                                                \n\n903 F.2d at 855.  \n\n          In Cannon, we applied the preceding analysis and upheld\n                   \n\nthe  admission  of  a  group  of  photographs  which  included  a\n\n\"mugshot\"  of the defendant.  The defendant had been convicted of\n\none count  of  armed bank  robbery  and appealed  his  conviction\n\nclaiming  that  the  admission  of  the  photographs  was  unduly\n\nprejudicial  and an abuse of discretion  by the trial court.  The\n\nphoto array in Cannon  consisted of individual, front-view, head-\n                     \n\nand-shoulder shots of  six young, white men.  Id.   We found that\n                                                \n\nthe admission of  the group of  photographs was not  an abuse  of\n\ndiscretion.7  \n\n          An application of the three factor Fosher test  in this\n                                                   \n\ncase establishes that admission  of the photospread into evidence\n\ndid  not   constitute  plain  error.     The  government's  chief\n\nidentification  witness at  trial  was  Inspector O'Neill,  whose\n\nidentification of  appellant had  been heatedly contested  at the\n\nfirst  trial.  Thus, the government introduced the photospread to\n\nstrengthen  Inspector  O'Neill's  identification testimony.    As\n\nexpected,  the  defense  did  indeed mount  an  effective  attack\n\nagainst  Inspector  O'Neill's  identification   testimony,  which\n\n                    \n\n7   We undertook \"abuse  of discretion\" review  in Cannon because\n                                                         \nthe defendant had interposed a specific Rule 404(b) objection.  \n\n                              - 16 -\n\nweakened  a  key  link in  the  government's  case.8   Thus,  the\n\ngovernment   had  a   demonstrable   need   for  the   challenged\n\nphotospread, as support for its critical identification evidence.\n\n          Second, the  photospread did not  imply that  appellant\n\nhad  a prior criminal record.  Like the photographs introduced in\n\nCannon,  the photospread  contained front-view  photographs only.\n      \n\nMoreover,  only  the face  of  each  individual  was visible,  as\n\ncardboard  had been used to redact both sides of the photographs.\n\nNo photographic backdrops  were visible.   There were no  profile\n\nshots,  no number  markings,  and  no  height  bars.    Like  the\n\nphotographs   in  Cannon,   the   photographs  included   in  the\n                        \n\nphotospread in this case possessed no characteristics identifying\n\nthem as police \"mugshots.\"\n\n          Third,  the   manner  in  which  the   photospread  was\n\nintroduced at trial drew no particular attention to the source or\n\n                    \n\n8  The defense  first attacked Inspector O'Neill's identification\nduring direct examination by  conducting a voir dire examination,\n                                                    \naimed at establishing that O'Neill could not have made a reliable\nidentification of her assailant from the photospread.  Later, the\ndefense  attacked Inspector  O'Neill's  identification on  cross-\nexamination and during its direct examination of Modesto Estrada,\na  police officer  who prepared  a statement  in response  to the\ncomplaint filed by Inspector O'Neill with the Puerto  Rico Police\nDepartment.    The  defense  highlighted  details   of  Inspector\nO'Neill's  identification testimony  at  the  second trial  which\ndiffered  from  her  testimony  at   the  first  trial  and  from\ndescriptions she had given previously to the postal inspector and\nto Officer Estrada.  The most significant differences related  to\nthe color of the assailant's eyes and skin.  Finally, the defense\nobtained admissions from O'Neill that  during the first trial she\nhad testified that the  lights at the intersection where  she had\nbeen  robbed were \"not bright,\"  whereas at the  second trial she\nstated  that  there  were   bright  \"anti-crime\"  lights  at  the\nintersection.\n\n                              - 17 -\n\nthe implications of the  photographs.  Indeed, government counsel\n\nand  Inspector  O'Neill said  nothing  about  the source  of  the\n\nphotographs or their implications.\n\n          As  the photospread was  properly admitted in evidence,\n\nthe  jury was entitled  to examine and  consider it.   We find no\n\nerror, plain or otherwise.\n\n          C.  The Sentencing Enhancements\n                                         \n\n          At sentencing, the district court increased appellant's\n\nbase offense level (\"BOL\")  of 20 by six levels for  the use of a\n\nfirearm  as charged  in count  three,9 see  U.S.S.G.    2B3.1; by\n                                          \n\nthree  levels  due  to  the  fact  that the  victim  was  a  \"law\n\nenforcement  officer,\" see  id.    3A1.2(b);  and finally  by one\n                              \n\nlevel  because  the loss  sustained as  a  result of  the robbery\n\nexceeded $10,000.00, see id.    2B3.1(b)(6)(A).  Combined with  a\n                           \n\ncriminal history category  of I,  the total offense  level of  30\n\n                    \n\n9  Count three charged that:\n\n            [T]he  defendant  herein  did  knowingly,\n            willfully, intentionally, and  unlawfully\n            rob  Postal  Inspector Ivette  O'Neill, a\n            person having lawful charge,  custody and\n            control  of  an  official  United  States\n            Postal  vehicle,  to  wit:   a  1989 gold\n            Honda  Accord,  registration  tag  number\n            AWX-038,  United  States  Postal  service\n            vehicle number  9911443 and in  so doing,\n            the  defendant,  HECTOR MANUEL  CARRILLO,\n            also known as  \"El Roquero,\" did  put the\n            life of Postal  Inspector Ivette  O'Neill\n            in  jeopardy by  the use  of  a dangerous\n            weapon,   to  wit:    a  stainless  steel\n            revolver with a barrel  approximately two\n            (2)  inches  long,  all  in  violation of\n            title 18, United States, section 2114.\n\n                              - 18 -\n\nresulted in a  guideline sentencing  range (\"GSR\") of  97 to  121\n\nmonths.  The sentencing court imposed a sentence of 121 months.\n\n          We review interpretations  of the Sentencing Guidelines\n\nde  novo.  United States v. Skrodzki,  9 F.3d 198 (1st Cir. 1993)\n                                    \n\n(citing  United States v.  Mullins, 992  F.2d 1472,  1478-79 (9th\n                                  \n\nCir.),  cert. denied, Winkleman v. United States, 113 S. Ct. 2997\n                                                \n\n(1993).  After determining the Guideline's  meaning and scope, we\n\nreview the  sentencing court's factual findings  for clear error.\n\nId. \n  \n\n          Appellant  argues  that  the  enhancement for  using  a\n\nfirearm  is  inappropriate  because  the  firearm  for  which  he\n\nreceived  a six level enhancement is the same firearm referred to\n\nin  count  two   of  the  indictment.10    He  contends,  without\n\nargument or citation to authority, that since  the jury acquitted\n\n                    \n\n10  Count two of the indictment reads,\n\n            [T]he defendant herein, did knowingly use\n            and  carry a  firearm  of  the  following\n            description:  a stainless  steel revolver\n            with  a  barrel  approximately   two  (2)\n            inches long, during and in relation to  a\n            crime of  violence in violation  of Title\n            18,  United States Code,  Section 111, as\n            defined  in Title 18, United States Code,\n            924(c)(1)   and   (3),   which   may   be\n            prosecuted  in  a  Court  of  the  United\n            States, to wit:   assaulting,  resisting,\n            opposing,   impeding,   intimidating   or\n            interfering, with Postal Inspector Ivette\n            O'Neill, an officer  designated in  Title\n            18,  United  States  Code, Section  1114,\n            while  engaged in the  performance of her\n            official  duties.   All  in  violation of\n            Title  18,  United  States Code,  Section\n            924(c)(1) and (3).  \n\n                              - 19 -\n\nhim on count two the sentencing court could not take the  firearm\n\ninto account for  calculating his  sentence on count  three.   We\n\nfind nothing inappropriate in the enhancement.\n\n          The Guidelines specifically provide that an enhancement\n\nis to  be applied when a firearm is used during the commission of\n\na robbery.  The fact that the jury found the appellant not guilty\n\non  count two of the  indictment is irrelevant  to the sentencing\n\nenhancement  applied  under  count  three,  because  count  three\n\nspecifically charged appellant with conduct which included \"[the]\n\nuse of a  dangerous weapon, to wit:   a stainless  steel revolver\n\nwith a barrel  approximately two (2) inches  long.\"  Accordingly,\n\nappellant's  argument that the six level  enhancement is based on\n\nconduct of which  he was acquitted mischaracterizes the basis for\n\nthe enhancement applied by the sentencing court.  \n\n          Thus,  we need  go  no  further.    Since  the  conduct\n\npursuant  to  which the  enhancement was  applied formed  part of\n\ncount  three as  alleged, and  since  appellant was  convicted on\n\ncount three, we believe that the district court correctly imposed\n\nthe six  level enhancement for use  of a firearm, see  U.S.S.G.  \n                                                     \n\n2B3.1(b)(2)(B), and  that the  resulting  ten-year and  one-month\n\nGuideline  sentence was  proper and  well within  the twenty-five\n\nyear maximum permitted under 18 U.S.C.   2114.\n\n          Next,  the  appellant  argues   that  the  three  level\n\nenhancement  imposed  because   Inspector  O'Neill   was  a   law\n\nenforcement officer  constituted  error since  the  base  offense\n\nlevel for robbery contains  an inherent enhancement which already\n\n                              - 20 -\n\ntakes  account of  O'Neill's status  as a  postal employee.   The\n\ncourt  applied  the  enhancement pursuant  to  Guideline  Section\n\n3A1.2.(b) which provides:\n\n            [If] during the course of the  offense or\n            immediate flight therefrom, the defendant\n            or   a  person  for   whose  conduct  the\n            defendant   is   otherwise   accountable,\n            knowing  or  having  reasonable cause  to\n            believe  that   a   person  was   a   law\n            enforcement   or   corrections   officer,\n            assaulted  such  officer   in  a   manner\n            creating  a  substantial risk  of serious\n            bodily injury, increase [the base offense\n            level] by 3 levels.\n\nNote 5 of the Commentary Notes to Section 3A1.2 provides:\n\n            Subdivision (b)  applies in circumstances\n            tantamount to  aggravated assault against\n            a law enforcement or corrections officer,\n            committed   in  the   course  of   or  in\n            immediate  flight   following  ,  another\n            offense,  such as  bank  robbery.   While\n            this subdivision may apply  in connection\n            with  a variety of  offenses that are not\n            by   nature  targeted   against  official\n            victims, its applicability is  limited to\n            assaultive     conduct     against    law\n            enforcement or  corrections officers that\n            is  sufficiently  serious  to  create  at\n            least  a  \"substantial  risk  of  serious\n            bodily injury\"  and that is  proximate in\n            time to the commission of the offense. \n\nAt the sentencing hearing,  the court ruled that the  enhancement\n\napplied  because  the defendant  had to  be aware  that Inspector\n\nO'Neill was a law enforcement officer as the vehicle that she was\n\ndriving exhibited  characteristics identifying it  as an official\n\nvehicle.\n\n          Appellant  contends that  Note 4  of the  Commentary to\n\nSection 3A1.2 precludes the enhancement:\n                       \n\n                              - 21 -\n\n            \"Motivated by such status\" in subdivision\n            (a) means that  the offense of conviction\n            was motivated by the fact that the victim\n            was a government officer and employee, or\n            a member of the immediate family thereof.\n            This  adjustment  would not  apply, where\n            both  the  defendant   and  victim   were\n            employed  by  the same  government agency\n            and  the  offense  was  motivated   by  a\n            personal dispute.  This  adjustment would\n            also not  apply in the case  of a robbery\n            of a postal employee because  the offense\n            guideline   for   robbery   contains   an\n            enhancement (  2B3.1(a))  that takes such\n            conduct into account.\n\nAppellant argues that Inspector O'Neill  is a postal employee and\n\nthat therefore  the three level enhancement should  not have been\n\napplied.  Appellant's reliance  on Note Four is misplaced.   Note\n\nFour governs when the three level enhancement is applied pursuant\n\nto section 3A1.2(a),  not section 3A1.2(b).  The sentencing court\n                         \n\nenhanced the BOL by  three levels because Inspector O'Neill  is a\n\nlaw enforcement officer, not  because she was a postal  employee.\n\nTo be sure, Note Four makes  clear that a three level enhancement\n\ncannot be applied pursuant to U.S.S.G. 3A1.2(a) if the offense of\n\nconviction was motivated by the fact that the victim was a postal\n\nemployee.  However, the  sentencing court applied the enhancement\n\nbecause  it found  that  the appellant  had  reasonable cause  to\n\nbelieve  that Inspector  O'Neill was  a law  enforcement officer.\n\nTherefore,  we find that the  court properly enhanced  the BOL by\n\nthree levels pursuant to   3A1.2(b).\n\n          Appellant's final assignment of error  involves the one\n\nlevel  enhancement imposed pursuant  to U.S.S.G.   2B3.1(b)(6)(A)\n\n                              - 22 -\n\nbecause the court calculated  the loss11 suffered as a  result of\n\nthe robbery at more  than $10,000.00.  The  court found that  the\n\nproperty  at issue  here --  a 1989  Honda Accord,  a bulletproof\n\nvest, a cellular telephone,  a radio, a radio converter,  and the\n\nvehicle's blue emergency revolving lights  -- had a total  market\n\nvalue of $14,635.00.  Section 2B3.1(b)(6)(A) provides that if the\n\nloss  suffered as a result  of a robbery  exceeds $10,000.00, the\n\nBOL should be increased by one level.  Appellant's contentions on\n\nappeal, generously construed, are that the sentencing court erred\n\nin finding that  the loss in this  case was more  than $10,000.00\n\nbecause (1)  the court did not use an appraisal of the vehicle in\n\nmaking its finding; (2) the court did not use the \"black book\" to\n\nestablish the vehicle's  fair market value;  (3) the fair  market\n\nvalue of  the vehicle at the time of the sentencing was less than\n\n$10,000.00  because as a government vehicle it is tax exempt; and\n\n(4) the  sum of the vehicle's  correct fair market value  and the\n\nvalue  of the  other  items missing  from the  car do  not exceed\n\n$10,000.00.\n\n          Ordinarily, when  property is taken, the  amount of the\n\nloss  is calculated  by  using  the  fair  market  value  of  the\n\nparticular property at  issue.   U.S.S.G.   2B1.1;  App. Note  2.\n\nThe  amount of loss in the case  of a vehicle is calculated using\n\nthe market value of the vehicle even if the vehicle is  recovered\n\nimmediately.   Id.    \"The  loss  need  not  be  determined  with\n                 \n\n                    \n\n11  \"Loss\" means the value of the property taken.  U.S.S.G. \n  2B1.1; App. Note 2.\n\n                              - 23 -\n\nprecision,  and  may be  inferred  from  any reasonably  reliable\n\ninformation  available, including  the scope  of the  operation.\"\n\nU.S.S.G.   2B1.1; App. \n\nNote 3.  A  defendant bears a heavy burden  of demonstrating that\n\nthe  district  court's finding  on  value  is clearly  erroneous.\n\nSkrodzki, 9 F.3d at 203.\n        \n\n          A  sentencing  court  may   base  its  finding  on  any\n\nreasonably reliable  information available.  In  finding that the\n\nmarket value  of the  items  at issue  here exceeded  the sum  of\n\n$10,000.00,  the  court credited  information in  the presentence\n\nreport, as well as the hearsay testimony of the probation officer\n\nat the  sentencing hearing that  postal agent J.J.  Rodr guez had\n\nstated  that the fair market value of the vehicle was $11,000.00;\n\nits  cost  to  the  government,  $8,750.00;  the   value  of  the\n\nbulletproof vest,  $350.00; the cellular telephone,  $850.00; the\n\nradio,  $1,700.00; the  radio converter,  $700.00; and  emergency\n\nlights, $35.00.   Appellant  presented no evidence  to rebut  the\n\nprobation officer's testimony.   Appellant advanced no ground for\n\nconsidering the testimony of the probation officer unreliable and\n\nthe sentencing court credited it  as having sufficient indicia of\n\nreliability.   Finally, the value  of government vehicles  is not\n                                 \n\naffected  by their  tax exempt  status.   The  sentencing court's\n\nfindings were not clearly  erroneous.  For the reasons  set forth\n\nabove, we find that  the sentencing court did not commit error in\n\nimposing appellant's sentence.\n\n                               III.\n\n                              - 24 -\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n          For  the foregoing reasons,  appellant's conviction and\n\nsentence are affirmed.\n             affirmed\n                     \n\n                              - 25 -\n",

United States v. Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d 1026, 1028 (1st Cir.1993) (citing United States v. Alvarez, 987 F.2d 77, 79 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 147, 126 L.Ed.2d 109 (1993)).  The facts are to the effect that on July 27, 1992, at approximately 8:30 p.m., Ivette O'Neill, a United States Postal Inspector, was driving home from work in a government vehicle assigned to her.  Inspector O'Neill was on twenty-four hour call and carried a government issued beeper, cellular phone, and car radio.  While stopped at an intersection, a man approached Inspector O'Neill, put a revolver to the left side of her head, told her that he was holding her up, and ordered her to exit the vehicle.  The man then drove off with the car.  As soon as he drove off, Inspector O'Neill telephoned the postal office to inform them of the robbery.  She also informed the robber, via the stolen car's radio, that the vehicle he had taken was a vehicle belonging to the United States and that his action constituted a federal offense.  The day after the robbery, the stolen vehicle was found in a parking lot near appellant's residence and not far from the intersection at which the robbery had taken place.  The vehicle was in a disheveled, dismantled state.  A bulletproof vest, a cellular telephone, a radio, a narcotics kit, and the vehicle's blue emergency revolving lights were missing from the car.  The postal inspector assigned to investigate the case received information that shortly after the incident, the appellant, also known as \"El Roquero,\" had attempted to sell a blue bulletproof vest in the neighborhood where Inspector O'Neill was robbed.  It was also discovered that appellant had previously been arrested by Puerto Rico police and charged with the theft of a motor vehicle.  The postal inspector obtained appellant's photograph from the Puerto Rico police department and prepared a photospread with the purpose of showing it to Inspector O'Neill.  The postal inspector showed Inspector O'Neill the photospread on November 12, 1992, and she identified appellant as her assailant by picking out his photograph from among the others in the photospread.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 25, 1992, a Federal Grand Jury returned a true bill against the appellant.  He was arraigned on December 2, 1992, and entered a plea of not guilty as to all three counts in the indictment.  The three-count indictment charged appellant with unlawfully assaulting, resisting, opposing, impeding, intimidating or interfering with Postal Inspector Ivette O'Neill while she was engaged in her official duties and with the use of a revolver.  The indictment further charged the appellant with the theft of the United States Postal vehicle which was within the lawful charge, custody and control of Inspector O'Neill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury trial commenced on January 8, 1993.  The case was submitted to the jury at around noon on January 12, 1994;  however, about five hours later the jury sent a note to the judge informing him that they were unable to reach a verdict.  Upon receipt of the jury's note, the judge called the jury and the parties into the courtroom.  The judge then instructed the jury that they need not agree on all counts charged in the indictment and that they might wish to consider whether they agreed on one or more counts.  The judge instructed the jury to go back to the jury room for further deliberation.  At approximately 6:15 p.m., however, the jury sent the judge a second note informing him that they were unable to reach a verdict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Before calling the jury back into the courtroom, the judge summoned counsel for the parties to ask for their suggestions on the matter.  Appellant's counsel asked the court to declare a mistrial.  The government opposed the request for a mistrial, and suggested instead that the jury be allowed to go home and return in the morning for further deliberations.  Counsel for the government also suggested that the jury be given an \"Allen\" charge.  The judge agreed that an \"Allen\" charge could prove helpful.  However, when the judge called the jury and asked them whether they thought they could reach a verdict if allowed to go home and return the following morning, the foreperson responded in the negative.  The rest of the jurors agreed with him by raising their hand.  The judge then granted the mistrial requested by the appellant and dismissed the jury.  Immediately thereafter, and before discharging counsel for the parties, the judge set a new trial for thirteen days later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 20, 1993, five days before the new trial was scheduled to begin, appellant filed a motion of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> 2]  In his motion, appellant argued that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient for a conviction and argued that a retrial was proscribed by the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause.  In the event that the trial court decided to deny his motion, the appellant asked the court to postpone the jury trial so that he could have an opportunity to appeal the denial of his motion.  The trial court did not rule on appellant's motion until the day of the commencement of the second trial.  After entertaining counsel's argument on the subject out of the presence of the jury, the court made a ruling from the bench denying appellant's motion for acquittal and finding that the government had presented sufficient evidence for a conviction.  The court also denied appellant's request for a continuance of the trial.  The trial commenced as scheduled on January 25, 1993, and lasted three days.  On the second day of trial, at the conclusion of the government's case, the appellant made a new motion for judgment of acquittal which the court denied.  The case was submitted to the jury on the third day of trial.  The jury delivered its verdict on the same day finding the appellant not guilty on counts one and two of the indictment, but guilty on count three.  After asking for an extension, which the court granted, the appellant filed a final motion for judgment of acquittal on February 22, 1993.  The court denied appellant's motion on April 16, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 14, 1993, the court sentenced the appellant to a term of imprisonment of 121 months and a term of supervised release of five years.  This appeal was timely filed on May 20, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Double Jeopardy Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant assigns error to the trial court's denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal filed after the first jury had been discharged, but before the commencement of the second trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Appellant does not ask us to review the correctness of the trial court's decision to deny his motion of acquittal, but instead asks us to vacate his conviction as he alleges that his second trial violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Appellant argues that the second trial put him in double jeopardy because he was entitled to a judgment of acquittal at the end of the first trial.  Pitching his argument on Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978), he argues that the trial court's failure to recognize the insufficiency of the evidence presented against him in the first trial and to provide him with an opportunity to appeal the court's denial allowed the government to \"take two bites out of the apple\" and obtain a conviction against him which it could not have obtained at the first trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, appellant argues that the Double Jeopardy Clause precluded his second trial due to the fact that the government failed to present enough evidence to convict during the first trial.  Specifically, appellant asserts that under Burks he was entitled to have a reviewing court examine the trial court's denial of his motion of acquittal for insufficiency of the evidence.  The petitioner in Burks had claimed insanity as a defense to a bank robbery count at trial, but was nevertheless convicted by the jury after the trial court denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal.  Burks appealed his conviction arguing that the trial court had erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal.  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, holding that the prosecution had failed to present sufficient evidence to rebut petitioner's proof as to insanity, reversed and remanded the case to the trial court with directions to determine whether judgment of acquittal should be entered or a new trial ordered.  The Supreme Court granted certiorari and held that double jeopardy had attached at the moment that the court of appeals determined that the prosecution had not presented sufficient evidence to convict at the first trial and that, therefore, the court of appeals should have entered or ordered a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant in a criminal proceeding is protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause against multiple punishments and repeated prosecutions for the same offense.  United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. 600, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (1976) (citing United States v. Wilson, 420 U.S. 332, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 43 L.Ed.2d 232 (1975));  North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2076, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969).  However, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not an absolute bar to successive trials.  Justices of Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon, 466 U.S. 294, 104 S.Ct. 1805, 80 L.Ed.2d 311 (1984).  \"The protection embodied in the Double Jeopardy Clause is a personal defense that may be waived or foreclosed by a defendant's voluntary actions or choices, including a request for or effectual consent to a mistrial.\"  United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta, 957 F.2d 18, 21 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, Aguilar-Aranceta v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 105, 121 L.Ed.2d 64 (1992) (citing United States v. Dipietro, 936 F.2d 6, 9 (1st Cir.1991)).  If a mistrial is declared at the request of the defendant, the defendant is deemed to have waived any double jeopardy claim he might otherwise have.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant moved for a mistrial after the jurors informed the trial court for the second time that they were unable to reach a verdict.  During oral argument before us, the appellant argued that he had no choice but to consent to the declaration of a mistrial.  The record, however, does not reveal a grudging consent by the appellant.  On the contrary, the record shows that the appellant asked for a mistrial almost immediately after the court elicited suggestions from counsel on how to respond to the jury's second note informing the court of their inability to reach a verdict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Before granting appellant's motion for a mistrial, the court advised the appellant that the case would have to be retried.  Appellant's counsel confirmed his understanding of this fact by stating: \"I know that, your Honor.  I know that we have to start again, yes, your Honor\".  Thus, the record reflects not only that the appellant requested the mistrial but that he expressly consented to a new trial.  The double jeopardy claim was waived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the double jeopardy claim had been preserved, it could not have succeeded.  A retrial following a \"hung jury\" does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Richardson v. United States, 468 U.S. 317, 324, 104 S.Ct. 3081, 3085, 82 L.Ed.2d 242 (1984) (citing to Logan v. United States, 144 U.S. 263, 297-98, 12 S.Ct. 617, 627-28, 36 L.Ed. 429 (1892)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Jury Access to the Photospread</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the trial court improperly permitted jury access, during deliberations, to a photospread which included a \"mugshot\" taken of appellant in connection with a previous arrest.  The photospread had been admitted into evidence over appellant's objection.  The photospread consisted of black and white photographs of six males including the appellant.  The photographs had been sandwiched between cardboard paper so that only the faces were visible.  The photographs were stapled together so that the six faces were arranged in a circle.  It was the same photospread shown to Inspector O'Neill on November 12, 1992, when she first identified the appellant as her assailant.  The government offered it into evidence to buttress Inspector O'Neill's identification, which was heatedly contested at both trials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant claims that the trial court committed reversible error by allowing the jurors to take the photospread with them during their deliberations.  Allowing the jurors to take the photospread was tantamount, the appellant argues, to the impermissible admission into evidence of \"other acts\" evidence contrary to Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.  The appellant essentially speculates that the jury could have gleaned that his photograph was a \"mugshot,\" from which it might have inferred that he had a prior criminal record.  Aside from its speculative nature, appellant's contention is precluded by his failure to see to it that the photospread was made part of the appellate record.  Effective appellate review is impossible without it.  Second, appellant failed to raise the present claim in the district court.  We will not consider arguments never presented to the trial court.  United States v. Lebon, 4 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Finally, during closing argument, appellant's counsel invited the jury to view appellant's photograph in the photospread and compare it to a written statement made by Inspector O'Neill.  In so doing, appellant sought to emphasize the alleged discrepancies between Inspector O'Neill's written description of her assailant and appellant's photograph in the photospread.  Thus, in myriad ways, appellant waived any claim that the jury was improperly allowed access to the photospread during its deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not read appellant's claim as a challenge to the admission of the photospread into evidence.  However, even if it were read to encompass such an indirect challenge, we would not find reversible error.  In objecting at trial, the appellant did not rely on Rule 404(b).  Indeed, he failed to state a basis for the objection.  Unless the basis for objection is apparent from the context, the grounds for objection must be specific so that the trial court may have an opportunity to address the claim later sought to be presented on appeal.  United States v. Figueroa, 976 F.2d 1446, 1453 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, Figueroa v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1346, 122 L.Ed.2d 728 (1993) (citing Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(1)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Before objecting to the admission of the photospread, the appellant conducted a voir dire examination of Inspector O'Neill pertaining to the photospread.  However, nothing in appellant's line of questioning indicated a concern that the admission of the photospread was equivalent to introducing \"prior bad acts\" evidence.  Rather, the voir dire examination was aimed at establishing that Inspector O'Neill could not have made an adequate identification of her assailant in the first instance because the photographs were not in color and the visible portions of the photographs were too small.  The voir dire examination established that Inspector O'Neill was not able to ascertain her assailant's height, skin tone, eye color, or hair color from the photographs included in the photospread.  At the conclusion of the voir dire examination, the court asked appellant whether he objected.  Appellant responded in the affirmative without elaboration, and the court overruled the objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, since appellant failed to state a specific objection based on Rule 404(b), and no such basis of objection could be considered clear from the context, the trial court was given no opportunity to address any concerns the appellant might have had regarding unfair prejudice resulting from the admission of the photospread into evidence.  Consequently, even if appellant's present claim were construed as an indirect attack on the trial court's evidentiary ruling, we would review it only for plain error.  United States v. Castiello, 915 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1990);  see Fed.R.Evid. 103(d) (\"Nothing in [Rule 103] precludes taking notice of plain errors affecting substantial rights although they were not brought to the attention of the Court\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">We have explained in general terms that</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>The admissibility of \"other acts\" evidence depends on a two-part analysis.  First, \"other acts\" evidence must be excluded if it is relevant only because it shows bad character (i.e. the proposed logical inference includes character as a necessary link.)\"  United States v. Ferrer-Cruz, 899 F.2d 135, 137 (1st Cir.1990) (emphasis in original).  Second, the district court must weigh the probative value of the \"other acts\" evidence against any unfair prejudice to the defendant;  and it is only when the risk of unfair prejudice \"substantially\" outweighs its probative value that the evidence is to be excluded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Figueroa, 976 F.2d at 1453 (quoting United States v. Shenker, 933 F.2d 61, 63 (1st Cir.1991)).  However, because there is grave risk of prejudice in the introduction of photographs such as \"mugshots\", we have adopted a three factor analysis specifically tailored to determining their admissibility.  See United States v. Cannon, 903 F.2d 849, 855 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, Cannon v. United States, 498 U.S. 1014, 111 S.Ct. 584, 112 L.Ed.2d 589 (1990).  These factors, adopted by us in United States v. Fosher, 568 F.2d 207, 215 (1st Cir.1978), are:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>1.  The government must have a demonstrable need to introduce the photograph;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>2.  The photographs themselves, if shown to the jury, must not imply that the defendant has a prior criminal record;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>3.  The manner of introduction at trial must be such that it does not draw particular attention to the source or implications of the photograph.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.  Thus, in reviewing a trial court's admission of \"mugshots\", we examine not only what was submitted, but why and how.  Cannon, 903 F.2d at 855.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Cannon, we applied the preceding analysis and upheld the admission of a group of photographs which included a \"mugshot\" of the defendant.  The defendant had been convicted of one count of armed bank robbery and appealed his conviction claiming that the admission of the photographs was unduly prejudicial and an abuse of discretion by the trial court.  The photo array in Cannon consisted of individual, front-view, head-and-shoulder shots of six young, white men.  Id. We found that the admission of the group of photographs was not an abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An application of the three factor Fosher test in this case establishes that admission of the photospread into evidence did not constitute plain error.  The government's chief identification witness at trial was Inspector O'Neill, whose identification of appellant had been heatedly contested at the first trial.  Thus, the government introduced the photospread to strengthen Inspector O'Neill's identification testimony.  As expected, the defense did indeed mount an effective attack against Inspector O'Neill's identification testimony, which weakened a key link in the government's case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Thus, the government had a demonstrable need for the challenged photospread, as support for its critical identification evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the photospread did not imply that appellant had a prior criminal record.  Like the photographs introduced in Cannon, the photospread contained front-view photographs only.  Moreover, only the face of each individual was visible, as cardboard had been used to redact both sides of the photographs.  No photographic backdrops were visible.  There were no profile shots, no number markings, and no height bars.  Like the photographs in Cannon, the photographs included in the photospread in this case possessed no characteristics identifying them as police \"mugshots.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the manner in which the photospread was introduced at trial drew no particular attention to the source or the implications of the photographs.  Indeed, government counsel and Inspector O'Neill said nothing about the source of the photographs or their implications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the photospread was properly admitted in evidence, the jury was entitled to examine and consider it.  We find no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Sentencing Enhancements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court increased appellant's base offense level (\"BOL\") of 20 by six levels for the use of a firearm as charged in count three,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2B3.1;  by three levels due to the fact that the victim was a \"law enforcement officer,\" see id. Sec. 3A1.2(b);  and finally by one level because the loss sustained as a result of the robbery exceeded $10,000.00, see id. Sec. 2B3.1(b)(6)(A).  Combined with a criminal history category of I, the total offense level of 30 resulted in a guideline sentencing range (\"GSR\") of 97 to 121 months.  The sentencing court imposed a sentence of 121 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review interpretations of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo.  United States v. Skrodzki, 9 F.3d 198 (1st Cir.1993) (citing United States v. Mullins, 992 F.2d 1472, 1478-79 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, Winkleman v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2997, 125 L.Ed.2d 691 (1993).  After determining the Guideline's meaning and scope, we review the sentencing court's factual findings for clear error.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the enhancement for using a firearm is inappropriate because the firearm for which he received a six level enhancement is the same firearm referred to in count two of the indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  He contends, without argument or citation to authority, that since the jury acquitted him on count two the sentencing court could not take the firearm into account for calculating his sentence on count three.  We find nothing inappropriate in the enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Guidelines specifically provide that an enhancement is to be applied when a firearm is used during the commission of a robbery.  The fact that the jury found the appellant not guilty on count two of the indictment is irrelevant to the sentencing enhancement applied under count three, because count three specifically charged appellant with conduct which included \"[the] use of a dangerous weapon, to wit:  a stainless steel revolver with a barrel approximately two (2) inches long.\"   Accordingly, appellant's argument that the six level enhancement is based on conduct of which he was acquitted mischaracterizes the basis for the enhancement applied by the sentencing court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we need go no further.  Since the conduct pursuant to which the enhancement was applied formed part of count three as alleged, and since appellant was convicted on count three, we believe that the district court correctly imposed the six level enhancement for use of a firearm, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2B3.1(b)(2)(B), and that the resulting ten-year and one-month Guideline sentence was proper and well within the twenty-five year maximum permitted under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2114.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the appellant argues that the three level enhancement imposed because Inspector O'Neill was a law enforcement officer constituted error since the base offense level for robbery contains an inherent enhancement which already takes account of O'Neill's status as a postal employee.  The court applied the enhancement pursuant to Guideline Section 3A1.2.  (b) which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>[If] during the course of the offense or immediate flight therefrom, the defendant or a person for whose conduct the defendant is otherwise accountable, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that a person was a law enforcement or corrections officer, assaulted such officer in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury, increase [the base offense level] by 3 levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Note 5 of the Commentary Notes to Section 3A1.2 provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>Subdivision (b) applies in circumstances tantamount to aggravated assault against a law enforcement or corrections officer, committed in the course of or in immediate flight following, another offense, such as bank robbery.  While this subdivision may apply in connection with a variety of offenses that are not by nature targeted against official victims, its applicability is limited to assaultive conduct against law enforcement or corrections officers that is sufficiently serious to create at least a \"substantial risk of serious bodily injury\" and that is proximate in time to the commission of the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the court ruled that the enhancement applied because the defendant had to be aware that Inspector O'Neill was a law enforcement officer as the vehicle that she was driving exhibited characteristics identifying it as an official vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that Note 4 of the Commentary to Section 3A1.2 precludes the enhancement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>\"Motivated by such status\" in subdivision (a) means that the offense of conviction was motivated by the fact that the victim was a government officer and employee, or a member of the immediate family thereof.  This adjustment would not apply, where both the defendant and victim were employed by the same government agency and the offense was motivated by a personal dispute.  This adjustment would also not apply in the case of a robbery of a postal employee because the offense guideline for robbery contains an enhancement (Sec. 2B3.1(a)) that takes such conduct into account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that Inspector O'Neill is a postal employee and that therefore the three level enhancement should not have been applied.  Appellant's reliance on Note Four is misplaced.  Note Four governs when the three level enhancement is applied pursuant to section 3A1.2(a), not section 3A1.2(b).  The sentencing court enhanced the BOL by three levels because Inspector O'Neill is a law enforcement officer, not because she was a postal employee.  To be sure, Note Four makes clear that a three level enhancement cannot be applied pursuant to U.S.S.G. 3A1.2(a) if the offense of conviction was motivated by the fact that the victim was a postal employee.  However, the sentencing court applied the enhancement because it found that the appellant had reasonable cause to believe that Inspector O'Neill was a law enforcement officer.  Therefore, we find that the court properly enhanced the BOL by three levels pursuant to Sec. 3A1.2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's final assignment of error involves the one level enhancement imposed pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2B3.1(b)(6)(A) because the court calculated the loss<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> suffered as a result of the robbery at more than $10,000.00.  The court found that the property at issue here--a 1989 Honda Accord, a bulletproof vest, a cellular telephone, a radio, a radio converter, and the vehicle's blue emergency revolving lights--had a total market value of $14,635.00.  Section 2B3.1(b)(6)(A) provides that if the loss suffered as a result of a robbery exceeds $10,000.00, the BOL should be increased by one level.  Appellant's contentions on appeal, generously construed, are that the sentencing court erred in finding that the loss in this case was more than $10,000.00 because (1) the court did not use an appraisal of the vehicle in making its finding;  (2) the court did not use the \"black book\" to establish the vehicle's fair market value;  (3) the fair market value of the vehicle at the time of the sentencing was less than $10,000.00 because as a government vehicle it is tax exempt;  and (4) the sum of the vehicle's correct fair market value and the value of the other items missing from the car do not exceed $10,000.00.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, when property is taken, the amount of the loss is calculated by using the fair market value of the particular property at issue.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2B1.1;  App.  Note 2.  The amount of loss in the case of a vehicle is calculated using the market value of the vehicle even if the vehicle is recovered immediately.  Id.  \"The loss need not be determined with precision, and may be inferred from any reasonably reliable information available, including the scope of the operation.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 2B1.1;  App.  Note 3.  A defendant bears a heavy burden of demonstrating that the district court's finding on value is clearly erroneous.  Skrodzki, 9 F.3d at 203.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A sentencing court may base its finding on any reasonably reliable information available.  In finding that the market value of the items at issue here exceeded the sum of $10,000.00, the court credited information in the presentence report, as well as the hearsay testimony of the probation officer at the sentencing hearing that postal agent J.J. Rodriguez had stated that the fair market value of the vehicle was $11,000.00;  its cost to the government, $8,750.00;  the value of the bulletproof vest, $350.00;  the cellular telephone, $850.00;  the radio, $1,700.00;  the radio converter, $700.00;  and emergency lights, $35.00.  Appellant presented no evidence to rebut the probation officer's testimony.  Appellant advanced no ground for considering the testimony of the probation officer unreliable and the sentencing court credited it as having sufficient indicia of reliability.

The facts are to the effect that on July 27, 1992, at approximately 8:30 p.m., Ivette O'Neill, a United States Postal Inspector, was driving home from work in a government vehicle assigned to her.  Inspector O'Neill was on twenty-four hour call and carried a government issued beeper, cellular phone, and car radio.  While stopped at an intersection, a man approached Inspector O'Neill, put a revolver to the left side of her head, told her that he was holding her up, and ordered her to exit the vehicle.  The man then drove off with the car.  As soon as he drove off, Inspector O'Neill telephoned the postal office to inform them of the robbery.  She also informed the robber, via the stolen car's radio, that the vehicle he had taken was a vehicle belonging to the United States and that his action constituted a federal offense.  The day after the robbery, the stolen vehicle was found in a parking lot near appellant's residence and not far from the intersection at which the robbery had taken place.  The vehicle was in a disheveled, dismantled state.  A bulletproof vest, a cellular telephone, a radio, a narcotics kit, and the vehicle's blue emergency revolving lights were missing from the car.  The postal inspector assigned to investigate the case received information that shortly after the incident, the appellant, also known as \"El Roquero,\" had attempted to sell a blue bulletproof vest in the neighborhood where Inspector O'Neill was robbed.  It was also discovered that appellant had previously been arrested by Puerto Rico police and charged with the theft of a motor vehicle.  The postal inspector obtained appellant's photograph from the Puerto Rico police department and prepared a photospread with the purpose of showing it to Inspector O'Neill.  The postal inspector showed Inspector O'Neill the photospread on November 12, 1992, and she identified appellant as her assailant by picking out his photograph from among the others in the photospread.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 25, 1992, a Federal Grand Jury returned a true bill against the appellant.  He was arraigned on December 2, 1992, and entered a plea of not guilty as to all three counts in the indictment.  The three-count indictment charged appellant with unlawfully assaulting, resisting, opposing, impeding, intimidating or interfering with Postal Inspector Ivette O'Neill while she was engaged in her official duties and with the use of a revolver.  The indictment further charged the appellant with the theft of the United States Postal vehicle which was within the lawful charge, custody and control of Inspector O'Neill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury trial commenced on January 8, 1993.  The case was submitted to the jury at around noon on January 12, 1994;  however, about five hours later the jury sent a note to the judge informing him that they were unable to reach a verdict.  Upon receipt of the jury's note, the judge called the jury and the parties into the courtroom.  The judge then instructed the jury that they need not agree on all counts charged in the indictment and that they might wish to consider whether they agreed on one or more counts.  The judge instructed the jury to go back to the jury room for further deliberation.  At approximately 6:15 p.m., however, the jury sent the judge a second note informing him that they were unable to reach a verdict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Before calling the jury back into the courtroom, the judge summoned counsel for the parties to ask for their suggestions on the matter.  Appellant's counsel asked the court to declare a mistrial.  The government opposed the request for a mistrial, and suggested instead that the jury be allowed to go home and return in the morning for further deliberations.  Counsel for the government also suggested that the jury be given an \"Allen\" charge.  The judge agreed that an \"Allen\" charge could prove helpful.  However, when the judge called the jury and asked them whether they thought they could reach a verdict if allowed to go home and return the following morning, the foreperson responded in the negative.  The rest of the jurors agreed with him by raising their hand.  The judge then granted the mistrial requested by the appellant and dismissed the jury.  Immediately thereafter, and before discharging counsel for the parties, the judge set a new trial for thirteen days later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 20, 1993, five days before the new trial was scheduled to begin, appellant filed a motion of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> 2]  In his motion, appellant argued that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient for a conviction and argued that a retrial was proscribed by the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause.  In the event that the trial court decided to deny his motion, the appellant asked the court to postpone the jury trial so that he could have an opportunity to appeal the denial of his motion.  The trial court did not rule on appellant's motion until the day of the commencement of the second trial.  After entertaining counsel's argument on the subject out of the presence of the jury, the court made a ruling from the bench denying appellant's motion for acquittal and finding that the government had presented sufficient evidence for a conviction.  The court also denied appellant's request for a continuance of the trial.  The trial commenced as scheduled on January 25, 1993, and lasted three days.  On the second day of trial, at the conclusion of the government's case, the appellant made a new motion for judgment of acquittal which the court denied.  The case was submitted to the jury on the third day of trial.  The jury delivered its verdict on the same day finding the appellant not guilty on counts one and two of the indictment, but guilty on count three.  After asking for an extension, which the court granted, the appellant filed a final motion for judgment of acquittal on February 22, 1993.  The court denied appellant's motion on April 16, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 14, 1993, the court sentenced the appellant to a term of imprisonment of 121 months and a term of supervised release of five years.  This appeal was timely filed on May 20, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Double Jeopardy Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant assigns error to the trial court's denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal filed after the first jury had been discharged, but before the commencement of the second trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Appellant does not ask us to review the correctness of the trial court's decision to deny his motion of acquittal, but instead asks us to vacate his conviction as he alleges that his second trial violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Appellant argues that the second trial put him in double jeopardy because he was entitled to a judgment of acquittal at the end of the first trial.  Pitching his argument on Burks v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109891\"><a href=\"/opinion/109891/burks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109891\"><a href=\"/opinion/109891/burks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span> </a></span>(1978), he argues that the trial court's failure to recognize the insufficiency of the evidence presented against him in the first trial and to provide him with an opportunity to appeal the court's denial allowed the government to \"take two bites out of the apple\" and obtain a conviction against him which it could not have obtained at the first trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, appellant argues that the Double Jeopardy Clause precluded his second trial due to the fact that the government failed to present enough evidence to convict during the first trial.  Specifically, appellant asserts that under Burks he was entitled to have a reviewing court examine the trial court's denial of his motion of acquittal for insufficiency of the evidence.  The petitioner in Burks had claimed insanity as a defense to a bank robbery count at trial, but was nevertheless convicted by the jury after the trial court denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal.  Burks appealed his conviction arguing that the trial court had erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal.  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, holding that the prosecution had failed to present sufficient evidence to rebut petitioner's proof as to insanity, reversed and remanded the case to the trial court with directions to determine whether judgment of acquittal should be entered or a new trial ordered.  The Supreme Court granted certiorari and held that double jeopardy had attached at the moment that the court of appeals determined that the prosecution had not presented sufficient evidence to convict at the first trial and that, therefore, the court of appeals should have entered or ordered a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant in a criminal proceeding is protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause against multiple punishments and repeated prosecutions for the same offense.

During oral argument before us, the appellant argued that he had no choice but to consent to the declaration of a mistrial.  The record, however, does not reveal a grudging consent by the appellant.  On the contrary, the record shows that the appellant asked for a mistrial almost immediately after the court elicited suggestions from counsel on how to respond to the jury's second note informing the court of their inability to reach a verdict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Before granting appellant's motion for a mistrial, the court advised the appellant that the case would have to be retried.  Appellant's counsel confirmed his understanding of this fact by stating: \"I know that, your Honor.  I know that we have to start again, yes, your Honor\".  Thus, the record reflects not only that the appellant requested the mistrial but that he expressly consented to a new trial.

Jury Access to the Photospread</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the trial court improperly permitted jury access, during deliberations, to a photospread which included a \"mugshot\" taken of appellant in connection with a previous arrest.  The photospread had been admitted into evidence over appellant's objection.  The photospread consisted of black and white photographs of six males including the appellant.  The photographs had been sandwiched between cardboard paper so that only the faces were visible.  The photographs were stapled together so that the six faces were arranged in a circle.  It was the same photospread shown to Inspector O'Neill on November 12, 1992, when she first identified the appellant as her assailant.  The government offered it into evidence to buttress Inspector O'Neill's identification, which was heatedly contested at both trials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant claims that the trial court committed reversible error by allowing the jurors to take the photospread with them during their deliberations.  Allowing the jurors to take the photospread was tantamount, the appellant argues, to the impermissible admission into evidence of \"other acts\" evidence contrary to Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.  The appellant essentially speculates that the jury could have gleaned that his photograph was a \"mugshot,\" from which it might have inferred that he had a prior criminal record.  Aside from its speculative nature, appellant's contention is precluded by his failure to see to it that the photospread was made part of the appellate record.  Effective appellate review is impossible without it.  Second, appellant failed to raise the present claim in the district court.  We will not consider arguments never presented to the trial court.  United States v. Lebon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629114\"><a href=\"/opinion/629114/united-states-v-peter-a-lebon/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Finally, during closing argument, appellant's counsel invited the jury to view appellant's photograph in the photospread and compare it to a written statement made by Inspector O'Neill.  In so doing, appellant sought to emphasize the alleged discrepancies between Inspector O'Neill's written description of her assailant and appellant's photograph in the photospread.  Thus, in myriad ways, appellant waived any claim that the jury was improperly allowed access to the photospread during its deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not read appellant's claim as a challenge to the admission of the photospread into evidence.  However, even if it were read to encompass such an indirect challenge, we would not find reversible error.  In objecting at trial, the appellant did not rely on Rule 404(b).  Indeed, he failed to state a basis for the objection.  Unless the basis for objection is apparent from the context, the grounds for objection must be specific so that the trial court may have an opportunity to address the claim later sought to be presented on appeal.

However, nothing in appellant's line of questioning indicated a concern that the admission of the photospread was equivalent to introducing \"prior bad acts\" evidence.  Rather, the voir dire examination was aimed at establishing that Inspector O'Neill could not have made an adequate identification of her assailant in the first instance because the photographs were not in color and the visible portions of the photographs were too small.  The voir dire examination established that Inspector O'Neill was not able to ascertain her assailant's height, skin tone, eye color, or hair color from the photographs included in the photospread.  At the conclusion of the voir dire examination, the court asked appellant whether he objected.  Appellant responded in the affirmative without elaboration, and the court overruled the objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, since appellant failed to state a specific objection based on Rule 404(b), and no such basis of objection could be considered clear from the context, the trial court was given no opportunity to address any concerns the appellant might have had regarding unfair prejudice resulting from the admission of the photospread into evidence.  Consequently, even if appellant's present claim were construed as an indirect attack on the trial court's evidentiary ruling, we would review it only for plain error.  United States v.

However, because there is grave risk of prejudice in the introduction of photographs such as \"mugshots\", we have adopted a three factor analysis specifically tailored to determining their admissibility.  See United States v.

The defendant had been convicted of one count of armed bank robbery and appealed his conviction claiming that the admission of the photographs was unduly prejudicial and an abuse of discretion by the trial court.  The photo array in Cannon consisted of individual, front-view, head-and-shoulder shots of six young, white men.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541944\"><a href=\"/opinion/541944/united-states-v-patrick-m-cannon/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> We found </a></span>that the admission of the group of photographs was not an abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An application of the three factor Fosher test in this case establishes that admission of the photospread into evidence did not constitute plain error.  The government's chief identification witness at trial was Inspector O'Neill, whose identification of appellant had been heatedly contested at the first trial.  Thus, the government introduced the photospread to strengthen Inspector O'Neill's identification testimony.  As expected, the defense did indeed mount an effective attack against Inspector O'Neill's identification testimony, which weakened a key link in the government's case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Thus, the government had a demonstrable need for the challenged photospread, as support for its critical identification evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the photospread did not imply that appellant had a prior criminal record.  Like the photographs introduced in Cannon, the photospread contained front-view photographs only.  Moreover, only the face of each individual was visible, as cardboard had been used to redact both sides of the photographs.  No photographic backdrops were visible.  There were no profile shots, no number markings, and no height bars.  Like the photographs in Cannon, the photographs included in the photospread in this case possessed no characteristics identifying them as police \"mugshots.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the manner in which the photospread was introduced at trial drew no particular attention to the source or the implications of the photographs.  Indeed, government counsel and Inspector O'Neill said nothing about the source of the photographs or their implications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the photospread was properly admitted in evidence, the jury was entitled to examine and consider it.

Sec. 2B3.1;  by three levels due to the fact that the victim was a \"law enforcement officer,\" see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541944\"><a href=\"/opinion/541944/united-states-v-patrick-m-cannon/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Sec. 3A1.2(b); </a></span> and finally by one level because the loss sustained as a result of the robbery exceeded $10,000.00, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541944\"><a href=\"/opinion/541944/united-states-v-patrick-m-cannon/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Sec. 2B3.1(b)(6)(A). </a></span> Combined with a criminal history category of I, the total offense level of 30 resulted in a guideline sentencing range (\"GSR\") of 97 to 121 months.

Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the enhancement for using a firearm is inappropriate because the firearm for which he received a six level enhancement is the same firearm referred to in count two of the indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  He contends, without argument or citation to authority, that since the jury acquitted him on count two the sentencing court could not take the firearm into account for calculating his sentence on count three.  We find nothing inappropriate in the enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Guidelines specifically provide that an enhancement is to be applied when a firearm is used during the commission of a robbery.  The fact that the jury found the appellant not guilty on count two of the indictment is irrelevant to the sentencing enhancement applied under count three, because count three specifically charged appellant with conduct which included \"[the] use of a dangerous weapon, to wit:  a stainless steel revolver with a barrel approximately two (2) inches long.\"   Accordingly, appellant's argument that the six level enhancement is based on conduct of which he was acquitted mischaracterizes the basis for the enhancement applied by the sentencing court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we need go no further.  Since the conduct pursuant to which the enhancement was applied formed part of count three as alleged, and since appellant was convicted on count three, we believe that the district court correctly imposed the six level enhancement for use of a firearm, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2B3.1(b)(2)(B), and that the resulting ten-year and one-month Guideline sentence was proper and well within the twenty-five year maximum permitted under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2114.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the appellant argues that the three level enhancement imposed because Inspector O'Neill was a law enforcement officer constituted error since the base offense level for robbery contains an inherent enhancement which already takes account of O'Neill's status as a postal employee.  The court applied the enhancement pursuant to Guideline Section 3A1.2.  (b) which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>[If] during the course of the offense or immediate flight therefrom, the defendant or a person for whose conduct the defendant is otherwise accountable, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that a person was a law enforcement or corrections officer, assaulted such officer in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury, increase [the base offense level] by 3 levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Note 5 of the Commentary Notes to Section 3A1.2 provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>Subdivision (b) applies in circumstances tantamount to aggravated assault against a law enforcement or corrections officer, committed in the course of or in immediate flight following, another offense, such as bank robbery.  While this subdivision may apply in connection with a variety of offenses that are not by nature targeted against official victims, its applicability is limited to assaultive conduct against law enforcement or corrections officers that is sufficiently serious to create at least a \"substantial risk of serious bodily injury\" and that is proximate in time to the commission of the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the court ruled that the enhancement applied because the defendant had to be aware that Inspector O'Neill was a law enforcement officer as the vehicle that she was driving exhibited characteristics identifying it as an official vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that Note 4 of the Commentary to Section 3A1.2 precludes the enhancement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>\"Motivated by such status\" in subdivision (a) means that the offense of conviction was motivated by the fact that the victim was a government officer and employee, or a member of the immediate family thereof.  This adjustment would not apply, where both the defendant and victim were employed by the same government agency and the offense was motivated by a personal dispute.  This adjustment would also not apply in the case of a robbery of a postal employee because the offense guideline for robbery contains an enhancement (Sec. 2B3.1(a)) that takes such conduct into account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that Inspector O'Neill is a postal employee and that therefore the three level enhancement should not have been applied.  Appellant's reliance on Note Four is misplaced.  Note Four governs when the three level enhancement is applied pursuant to section 3A1.2(a), not section 3A1.2(b).  The sentencing court enhanced the BOL by three levels because Inspector O'Neill is a law enforcement officer, not because she was a postal employee.  To be sure, Note Four makes clear that a three level enhancement cannot be applied pursuant to U.S.S.G. 3A1.2(a) if the offense of conviction was motivated by the fact that the victim was a postal employee.  However, the sentencing court applied the enhancement because it found that the appellant had reasonable cause to believe that Inspector O'Neill was a law enforcement officer.  Therefore, we find that the court properly enhanced the BOL by three levels pursuant to Sec. 3A1.2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's final assignment of error involves the one level enhancement imposed pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2B3.1(b)(6)(A) because the court calculated the loss<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> suffered as a result of the robbery at more than $10,000.00.  The court found that the property at issue here--a 1989 Honda Accord, a bulletproof vest, a cellular telephone, a radio, a radio converter, and the vehicle's blue emergency revolving lights--had a total market value of $14,635.00.  Section 2B3.1(b)(6)(A) provides that if the loss suffered as a result of a robbery exceeds $10,000.00, the BOL should be increased by one level.  Appellant's contentions on appeal, generously construed, are that the sentencing court erred in finding that the loss in this case was more than $10,000.00 because (1) the court did not use an appraisal of the vehicle in making its finding;  (2) the court did not use the \"black book\" to establish the vehicle's fair market value;  (3) the fair market value of the vehicle at the time of the sentencing was less than $10,000.00 because as a government vehicle it is tax exempt;  and (4) the sum of the vehicle's correct fair market value and the value of the other items missing from the car do not exceed $10,000.00.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, when property is taken, the amount of the loss is calculated by using the fair market value of the particular property at issue.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2B1.1;  App.  Note 2.  The amount of loss in the case of a vehicle is calculated using the market value of the vehicle even if the vehicle is recovered immediately.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  \"The loss </span>need not be determined with precision, and may be inferred from any reasonably reliable information available, including the scope of the operation.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 2B1.1;  App.  Note 3.  A defendant bears a heavy burden of demonstrating that the district court's finding on value is clearly erroneous.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195031\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Skrodzki,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195031/united-states-v-skrodzki/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A sentencing court may base its finding on any reasonably reliable information available.  In finding that the market value of the items at issue here exceeded the sum of $10,000.00, the court credited information in the presentence report, as well as the hearsay testimony of the probation officer at the sentencing hearing that postal agent J.J. Rodriguez had stated that the fair market value of the vehicle was $11,000.00;  its cost to the government, $8,750.00;  the value of the bulletproof vest, $350.00;  the cellular telephone, $850.00;  the radio, $1,700.00;  the radio converter, $700.00;  and emergency lights, $35.00.  Appellant presented no evidence to rebut the probation officer's testimony.  Appellant advanced no ground for considering the testimony of the probation officer unreliable and the sentencing court credited it as having sufficient indicia of reliability.  Finally, the value of government vehicles is not affected by their tax exempt status.  The sentencing court's findings were not clearly erroneous.  For the reasons set forth above, we find that the sentencing court did not commit error in imposing appellant's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, appellant's conviction and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The note read:  \"Your honor, honestly it is impossible to reach a verdict.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Rule 29(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides as follows:</p>\n        <p>If the jury returns a verdict of guilty or is discharged without having returned a verdict, a motion for judgment of acquittal may be made or renewed within 7 days after the jury is discharged or within such further time as the court may fix during the 7-day period.  If a verdict of guilty is returned the court may on such motion set aside the verdict and enter judgment of acquittal.  If no verdict is returned the court may enter judgment of acquittal.  It shall not be necessary to the making of such a motion that a similar motion has been made prior to the submission of the case to the jury.</p>\n        <p>Appellant filed his motion eight days after the jury was discharged;  however, his motion was timely as the 7-day period began to run on January 13 and intermediate weekends are excluded from the computation of a seven-day period.

Let's hear suggestions from counsel.</p>\n        <p>[PROSECUTOR]:  Your Honor, they may just be very exhausted, and I would suggest to the Court to just let them rest this evening and have them return tomorrow morning to continue deliberation.  They have not been deliberating that long considering that the trial did begin on Friday.</p>\n        <p>THE COURT:  Well, the case was submitted about twelve noon.</p>\n        <p>[PROSECUTOR]:  That is correct, your Honor.</p>\n        <p>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  Your honor, this is a very short case.  They have been deliberating more and they have taken longer than has taken the testimony of the witnesses.  More than six hours they have been deliberating.  I believe it is impossible to reach an agreement.  I believe the jury should be excused and a hung jury--no verdict be entered, your Honor, because honestly this case started at noon during the afternoon on Friday with only one testimony, after 2:00 o'clock because you were attending a TRO in another case.  For less than two hours the witness where testifying.  All in all he--in the whole case it hasn't taken six hours complete of testimony for the jury.  They--said it is impossible to reach an agreement.  No, the case is very short.
