Petitioner Felix Nunez  seeks review of  a\r                           \n\ndecision  of the  Board of  Immigration Appeals  upholding an\n\nImmigration  Judge's  order  that   he  be  deported  to  the\n\nDominican  Republic.     Assuming  arguendo  that   appellate\r                                                       \n\njurisdiction  exists  with  regard to  his  prematurely filed\n\npetition,  see, e.g., In re Villa  Marina Yacht Harbor, Inc.,\r                                                                        \n\n984 F.2d 546,  548 n.2 (1st Cir. 1993),  we deny the petition\n\nfor review and enforce the order of deportation.  \n\n     As the Immigration Judge correctly found, petitioner was\n\nineligible to apply for a discretionary waiver under   212(c)\n\nof the Immigration  and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.    1182(c),\n\nfor two  separate reasons.  Petitioner  lacked (and continues\n\nto   lack)  the   \"seven   consecutive   years\"  of   \"lawful\n\nunrelinquished domicile\" that are a statutory prerequisite to\n\nsuch relief.   See, e.g., Goncalves  v. INS, 6 F.3d  830, 834\r                                                       \n\n(1st Cir.  1993)  (seven-year clock  \"stop[s]  ticking\"  once\n\nBoard upholds deportation order).   As well,   212(c)  relief\n\nis unavailable to an  alien who is deportable for  a firearms\n\noffense.  See, e.g.,  Campos v. INS, 961  F.2d 309 (1st  Cir.\r                                               \n\n1992).  \n\n     In turn, petitioner satisfied  none of the prerequisites\n\nfor an  adjustment of  status under    245(a)  of the  Act, 8\n\nU.S.C.    1255(a).  It  suffices to note in  this regard that\n\nhis drug convictions rendered  him inadmissible to the United\n\nStates, see,  e.g., Jenkins v. INS,  32 F.3d 11, 15  (2d Cir.\r                                              \r\r\n\n1994),  and therefore  ineligible for    245(a)  relief, see,\r                                                                        \n\ne.g., Rodrigues v. INS, 994 F.2d 32, 33 (1st Cir. 1993).  And\r                                  \n\nagain because  of petitioner's failure to  satisfy   212(c)'s\n\nseven-year  requirement,  the   form  of  concurrent   relief\n\ndescribed in In re Gabryelsky, Int. Dec. 3213 (BIA 1993); see\r                                                                         \n\nalso Snajder v.
