Plaintiff filed pro se an eleven count\r                                                         \r\n\namended complaint  alleging  a variety  of common-law  torts,\r\n\nconstitutional,  and  statutory  claims  against  the  United\r\n\nStates Department  of the  Navy, the Department  of Veterans'\r\n\nAffairs  and unknown  government  agents.   In  a motion  \"to\r\n\ndismiss or for summary judgment,\" defendants sought dismissal\r\n\nof most  of the  counts on jurisdictional  grounds, including\r\n\nlack  of statutory jurisdiction,  sovereign immunity, failure\r\n\nto  timely file  under  the  Federal  Torts  Claims  Act  and\r\n\nmootness.  Other counts were challenged  for failure to state\r\n\na claim.   Plaintiff offered voluminous  exhibits, affidavits\r\n\nand memoranda in support of his cause.\r\n\n          The  magistrate's  careful  and  thoughtful  report\r\n\nanalyzed  each  of the  claims,  the  relevant arguments  and\r\n\nevidence,  and  recommended  dismissal  of   each  count  for\r\n\nseparately delineated jurisdictional and merit-based reasons.\r\n\nPlaintiff's  lengthy  objections  to  the  report  were  then\r\n\nconsidered   by   the  district   judge,   who  adopted   the\r\n\nmagistrate's recommendations in all respects.  \r\n\n          Reviewing the dismissal de  novo, we too agree with\r                                                      \r\n\nthe magistrate's  detailed analysis  and affirm  the district\r\n\ncourt judgment substantially for the reasons set forth in the\r\n\nmagistrate's report.  \r\n\n          We have also explored the record with care in light\r\n\nof a host of alleged procedural errors assigned by plaintiff.\r\r\n\nWithout  attempting  to  characterize  plaintiff's  arguments\r\n\nprecisely, he challenges most of the court's interim rulings,\r\n\nincluding  an  order extending  the  time  for defendants  to\r\n\nanswer  the  complaint, an  order  staying discovery  pending\r\n\ndisposition of defendants' motion  to dismiss, the  procedure\r\n\nused  and  evidence considered  in  resolving  the motion  to\r\n\ndismiss,  the rejection of his  motion for the appointment of\r\n\ncounsel,  and the rejection of his motions for recusal of the\r\n\ndistrict judge.  In  addition, plaintiff challenges the power\r\n\nof the court to  appoint a magistrate to consider  the motion\r\n\nto dismiss. \r\n\n          We   find  no   abuse  of   discretion   nor  other\r\n\nprejudicial  error in the court's  orders.  There  is also no\r\n\nsupport   in   the   record   for   plaintiff's  wide-ranging\r\n\naccusations  of  fraud,  intimidation, and  other  wrongdoing\r\n\nduring  the pendency of the  case by defendants, the district\r\n\njudge, the magistrates and the court clerk.\r\n\n          The judgment is affirmed.  Plaintiff's motions \"for\r                                              \r\n\nhearing  on fraud upon the court,\" for \"summary judgement . .\r\n\n.  because  of  appellee's  fraud,\" and  \"to  hold  immediate\r\n\nhearing on death threats,\" are denied.\r                                                 \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
