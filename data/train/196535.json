Stern, United States  Attorney, and Michael D. Ricciuti,\r                                                                             \r\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.  Pro se defendant Michael  Barnett appeals a\r                                    \r\n\ndistrict  court order  that summarily  denied his  motion for\r\n\nrelief from his sentence under 28 U.S.C.   2255.  Barnett was\r\n\nconvicted of three offenses  arising out of his participation\r\n\nin a  conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine.   See United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Barnett, 989 F.2d 546 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 114\r                                                                    \r\n\nS. Ct. 148  (1993).  He  was sentenced to  a total of  thirty\r\n\nyears'  imprisonment.    Barnett's  motion  and  supplemental\r\n\nfilings  alleged  that  his sentence  was  the  result  of an\r\n\nimproper application  of the Sentencing Guidelines.   He also\r\n\nclaimed  that  his  sentence  violated  the  Double  Jeopardy\r\n\nClause.\r\n\n     We have thoroughly reviewed  the record and the parties'\r\n\nbriefs  on appeal.   We  conclude that  Barnett's claims  are\r\n\nwholly  lacking in  merit  and that  his motion  was properly\r\n\ndenied.   Briefly, neither of Barnett's  claims is cognizable\r\n\nunder 28 U.S.C.   2255 unless Barnett shows \"cause\" to excuse\r\n\nhis procedural  default  and  prejudice  resulting  from  the\r\n\nalleged errors, or  that the failure  to consider his  claims\r\n\nwill  result in  a  fundamental miscarriage  of justice.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nLevasseur v.  Pepe, 70 F.3d  187, 192 (1st  Cir. 1995)(citing\r                              \r\n\nColeman  v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991)).  Barnett has\r                                \r\n\nfailed to make either  showing.  Barnett's claim that  he did\r\n\nnot possess  the 50 kilogram container  of pseudoephedrine as\r\n\npart of the  conspiracy appears to be frivolous where Barnett\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nadmitted that he was the \"chemist\" for the conspiracy and his\r\n\ncodefendant was recorded  saying that he and his  chemist had\r\n\ningredients to  make 40 pounds  of methamphetamine.   Even if\r\n\nthe contention has  some merit, it  cannot be said  to be  so\r\n\nobvious or strong  that counsel's failure to  raise the point\r\n\namounted to ineffective assistance.  See Jones v. Barnes, 463\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 745, 750-54  (1983)(counsel has no  duty to raise  every\r\n\nnonfrivolous issue requested by defendant).  Barnett's Double\r\n\nJeopardy claim is also meritless.   As each of his counts  of\r\n\nconviction required proof of  an element that the  others did\r\n\nnot, his sentence does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause\r\n\nunder the familiar Blockburger test.  \r                                          \r\n\n     On appeal,  Barnett argues that U.S.S.G.   2D1.11 (1994)\r\n\nrequires  that he  be resentenced  to a  substantially lesser\r\n\nterm.  We have considered this argument,  although it was not\r\n\nmade below, because  2D1.11  was not retroactive when Barnett\r\n\nsubmitted his   2255 motion.  We conclude that this guideline\r\n\ndoes not entitle Barnett to any relief from his sentence.  To\r\n\nthe contrary, Barnett  would have  been subject  to the  same\r\n\noffense level under  2D1.11, comment. n. 3.  Accordingly, the\r\n\njudgment of the district court is affirmed.\r                                                      \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n",
