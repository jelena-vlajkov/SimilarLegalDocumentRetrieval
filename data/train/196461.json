William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                                \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                     Selya, Cyr and Stahl,\r\n                       Circuit Judges.\r                                                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\nBenjamin Hoover, Jr. on brief pro se.\r                                \r\nMichael L. Rosen, Paul V. Lyons, and Foley, Hoag &amp; Eliot on  brief\r                                                                    \r\nfor appellees.  \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per  Curiam.    The  district court  dismissed  Benjamin\r                            \r\n\nHoover's 42 U.S.C.    1981 suit for his counsel's  failure to\r\n\nattend  a status conference.  Hoover now appeals.  We affirm.\r\n\n     After  Hoover's case  had been  pending for  nearly four\r\n\nmonths, the  court issued a notice  advising Hoover's counsel\r\n\nthat it would hold a status conference in two weeks.  Counsel\r\n\nasserts  that she did not receive this notice, but, five days\r\n\nbefore the  conference was  to take  place,  Hoover told  her\r\n\nabout  it.   Counsel then  called a  district court  clerk to\r\n\nreschedule the  conference.    After  discussion,  the  clerk\r\n\ndeclined  to reschedule,  warning  counsel  that  failure  to\r\n\nattend the conference would result in dismissal of the  case.\r\n\nSeveral hours  before the conference was  held, counsel moved\r\n\nfor a continuance, which was denied.  She did not  attend the\r\n\nconference.   Her motion  advanced only one  colorable reason\r\n\nfor not attending.   It averred that the date \"was  a problem\r\n\nwith  regard to other matters I had scheduled for that date.\"\r\n\nConcluding, apparently,  that counsel had no  good reason for\r\n\nfailing to appear, the court dismissed the action.  \r\n\n     Our cases make clear that a district court may dismiss a\r\n\ncase with prejudice if plaintiff or counsel has willfully  or\r\n\nunjustifiably disobeyed  a court  order.  Compare  Barreto v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCitibank, N.A., 907 F.2d 15, 16 (1st Cir. 1990), and Goldman,\r                                                                         \r\n\nAntonetti,   Ferraiuoli,   Axtmayer  &amp;   Hertell   v.
