Freedman, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n                                                        \n\n                                        \n\n                            Before\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\n                                         \n                Selya and Cyr, Circuit Judges.\n                                             \n\n                                        \n\n   Vincent O.

The  district court  properly  dismissed\n                \n\nplaintiff's action  for lack of jurisdiction  and for failure\n\nto state a claim.  We explain briefly.\n\n     If  the  state   probate  court  incorrectly   concluded\n\nplaintiff  had been  properly  served, erred  in refusing  to\n\norder blood tests, improperly  assessed the evidence, or made\n\nother mistakes,  plaintiff's remedy was to  appeal within the\n\nstate  court system and then petition the Supreme Court for a\n\nwrit of certiorari.  Plaintiff may not litigate these type of\n\nchallenges to the state court proceedings  in a lower federal\n\ncourt because  lower  federal  courts  lack  jurisdiction  to\n\nreview  state court  proceedings.
