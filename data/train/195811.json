Keith  Parkinson once  again\r                    ZOBEL,  District Judge\r                                          \n\nappeals  his sentence.  After a one-day jury trial, defendant was\n\nconvicted of robbing a  bank in Portland, Maine, in  violation of\n\n18 U.S.C.   2113(a) (1991).   He subsequently was sentenced  to a\n\nterm of imprisonment of  240 months, to run consecutively  to the\n\nremainder  of   a  ten-to-twenty  year  sentence   imposed  by  a\n\nMassachusetts  state court for the  robbery of a  bank in Boston,\n\nMassachusetts.    On  appeal,  we affirmed  the  conviction,  but\n\nvacated the sentence because the  district court had not followed\n\nthe  directive  of   5G1.3(c)  of  the  United States  Sentencing\n\nGuidelines  (\"U.S.S.G.\"  or  \"Sentencing  Guidelines\")   when  it\n\nimposed an entirely consecutive  federal sentence.  United States\r                                                                           \n\nv. Parkinson, No. 91-2233,  1993 WL 89801, at  *6 (1st Cir.  Mar.\r                      \n\n30, 1993).    After remand,  the district  court again  sentenced\n\ndefendant to a period  of incarceration of 240 months, now  to be\n\nserved concurrently  with the  remainder of his  state sentence.1\n\nAt the  time  of the  resentencing  defendant had  served  either\n\nforty-six or forty-eight months of that  Massachusetts sentence.2\n\nHe now  argues that the  sentence, by  not taking account  of the\n\nstate time  already served,  represents an upward  departure from\n\nthe applicable guideline range of 210 to 262 months, which on the\n\n                    \r                              \n\n1  At resentencing, the court, without dissent from either party,\napplied the 1993 Sentencing Guidelines.  We do likewise.\n\n2   Defendant had served forty-eight months  from the date of his\narrest  on the state charge and forty-six months from the date of\nsentencing on that offense.\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nfacts of this case, he says, was improper.3\n\n          The  parties  disagree  as  to the  issues  on  appeal.\n\nDefendant,  ignoring  the  first  part of  the  district  judge's\n\nexegesis, presumes that the judge departed upwardly, and suggests\n\nthat the issue before us is whether such departure was justified.\n\nThe government presents a more complete, and in our view correct,\n\nstatement  of the issues; namely, is time served in state custody\n\nbefore the  imposition of  the federal sentence  included in  the\n\ncalculus under    5G1.3(c) when deciding whether  the sentence is\n\noutside the applicable guideline  range; and, only if so,  was an\n\nupward departure  in the  instant case  appropriate.   Because we\n\nanswer the former inquiry in the negative, we need not reach  the\n\nlatter.  Nonetheless, a review of the record shows that an upward\n\ndeparture would be appropriate.\n\n                        Standard of Review\r                                                    \n\n          We  consider  de novo  the legal  meaning and  scope of\r                                         \n\n  5G1.3(c) (Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant Subject to an\n\nUndischarged  Term  of  Imprisonment).    See  United  States  v.\r                                                                       \n\nThompson, 32  F.3d 1, 4  (1st Cir.  1994).  The  district court's\r                  \n\nfact-finding,  however,  we  review  for clear  error,  with  due\n\ndeference given its application of   5G1.3(c) to the facts of the\n\ncase. SeeUnited Statesv. St. Cyr,977 F.2d698, 701(1st Cir. 1992).\r                                          \n                    \r                              \n\n3   This  range represents, coincidentally,  both what  the total\npunishment  would have  been,  in accordance  with    5G1.2,  had\ndefendant been  sentenced on the  federal and state  bank robbery\nconvictions  at the same  time in  federal court  as well  as the\npunishment for the single  federal conviction.  Both calculations\nare  based upon  a  criminal history  category  of VI  and  total\noffense level of 32.  Defendant does not dispute either.\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n                      Was there a departure?\r                                                      \n\n          A perusal of   5G1.3 leads us to conclude that in order\n\nto determine  whether a sentence  imposed pursuant to    5G1.3(c)\n\nrepresents a departure  from the guidelines,  we do not  consider\n\ntime served in  state custody.   To hold  otherwise would  equate\n\n\"sentence\" with \"total punishment\"  and leave meaningless much of\n\nthe language of   5G1.3, which we are bound to follow.   Like the\n\npolicy statements, the commentary to the Sentencing Guidelines is\n\nbinding when it \"interprets or explains a guideline . .  . unless\n\nit  violates  the  Constitution  or  a  federal  statute,  or  is\n\ninconsistent  with,  or  a  plainly erroneous  reading  of,  that\n\nguideline.\"   Stinson v. United States,  113 S.  Ct. 1913,  1915,\r                                                \n\n1918  (1993).   Similarly, even  \"'[p]ortions of  [the Guidelines\n\nManual] not labeled as guidelines  or commentary . . . are  to be\n\nconstrued  as commentary  and  thus  have  the  force  of  policy\n\nstatements.'\"  Id. at 1918 (quoting U.S.S.G.   1B1.7, comment.).\r                            \n\n          Section  5G1.3  is designed  to achieve  an incremental\n\npunishment for a defendant who, at the time of sentencing for the\n\ninstant  offense,   is  subject   to  an  undischarged   term  of\n\nimprisonment.  U.S.S.G.   5G1.3.  Although there is discretion as\n\nto how to accomplish the incremental punishment, in fashioning an\n\nappropriate sentence,  the district  court is constrained  by the\n\nSentencing  Guidelines.    U.S.S.G.    5G1.3,  comment.  n.3;  28\n\nU.S.C.A.    994(a)  (West  1993).    The  court  should  use  the\n\nfollowing method to  reach the  sentence: (1)  compute the  total\n\noffense level  for the  instant offense and  defendant's criminal\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nhistory category; (2) determine the resulting guideline range for\n\nthat offense; and (3) choose the point within the guideline range\n\nthat  effects  a  reasonable  incremental punishment  and  decide\n\nwhether that  sentence  will run  concurrently or  consecutively.\n\nSee  United States  v.  Jackson,  30  F.3d  199,  201  (1st  Cir.\r                                         \n\n1994)(citing  18 U.S.C.   3553 (a),(b) (1988)); U.S.S.G.   5G1.3,\n\ncomment. n.3.\n\n          The commentary  to    5G1.3 instructs that,  to compute\n\nsuch  an  incremental  punishment,   a  sentencing  judge  should\n\nconsider the  guideline grouping rules of    5G1.2 (Sentencing on\n\nMultiple Counts of Conviction) which defines the total punishment\n\nthat the defendant would have received had he been simultaneously\n\nsentenced  in federal court for both offenses.  U.S.S.G.   5G1.3;\n\nParkinson, 1993 WL 89801, at *4.  Under   5G1.2, an offense level\r                   \n\nand criminal history category for the combined offenses establish\n\na guideline range,  from which the  total punishment is  derived.\n\nU.S.S.G.    5G1.2,  comment.   Often,  by  discounting the  total\n\npunishment for time already  served on the undischarged sentence,\n\nthe  sentencing  judge  can  attain  an  incremental  punishment.\n\nU.S.S.G.   5G1.3.\n\n          Confusion  in  this  case   arises  from  two   unusual\n\ncircumstances.   First, the statutory  maximum for the offense of\n\nconviction  is well below the  upper end of  the guideline range.\n\nSecond,  because  of defendant's  extensive  criminal  record (23\n\ncriminal history points; 10 above the  maximum, category VI), the\n\n  5G1.2 calculation results  in the same guideline range  as that\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\narrived  at  pursuant to    2B3.1  for  the instant  bank robbery\n\noffense.  In most cases, the latter would be less than the former\n\nand the total punishment would not exceed the  hypothetical range\n\nfor   the  combined  offenses.     Nevertheless,  the  Sentencing\n\nCommission carefully  distinguished a \"sentence  for the  instant\n\noffense\" from the \"total  punishment.\"  See generally U.S.S.G.   \r                                                               \n\n5G1.3.  Therefore, when  determining whether the sentencing judge\n\ndeparted  from  the guideline  range,  we  look  at the  sentence\n\nimposed  for the instant offense, not the total punishment.  This\n\nis appropriate even  were the total  punishment beyond the  range\n\ncalculated  under   5G1.2, because that section is a guide, not a\n\nmandate.    See    5G1.3,  comment.  n.3  (instructing  court  to\r                         \n\n\"consider\"   5G1.2 \"to the extent practicable\").\n\n          The trial  court correctly looked to  the guideline for\n\nthe  offense of conviction,   2B3.1, and found that Parkinson had\n\nan offense  level of  32 and,  as a  career offender,  a criminal\n\nhistory   category  of  VI.    See  U.S.S.G.     5G1.3,  comment.\r                                            \n\nn.3(D)(illustrating  that, absent  departure, sentence  must fall\n\nwithin the guideline  range for the  instant offense).   Although\n\nthis combination would ordinarily yield  a guideline range of 210\n\nto 262 months, as noted above,  the statutory cap on the  offense\n\nof conviction here was  240 months.  18 U.S.C.A.    2113(a) (West\n\n1994).    Thus,  the  imposed 240-month  sentence,  to  be served\n\nconcurrently with the undischarged portion of Parkinson's ten-to-\n\ntwenty  year  state  sentence,  was  not  a  departure  from  the\n\nguideline range for the instant offense.\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n              Would a departure have been justified?\r                                                              \n\n          Although  we  hold that  the  sentence  was within  the\n\nguideline range, a departure  in this case would be  warranted in\n\nany event.  This Court reviews the sentencing court's decision to\n\ndepart using  a three-step inquiry: first,  are the circumstances\n\nof  the case  sufficiently unusual  to justify  departure, United\r                                                                           \n\nStates v.

Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 950  (1st Cir. 1993); and third,\r                           \n\nis  the  departure reasonable,  Jackson, 30  F.3d  202 n.3.   See\r                                                                           \n\ngenerally United States  v. D az-Villafa e, 874 F.2d  43, 49 (1st\r                                                    \n\nCir.),  cert. denied 493 U.S. 862 (1989).  Because defendant does\r                              \n\nnot  challenge the  reasonableness of  the departure,  we discuss\n\nonly the  first  two steps  below.   Our review  of the  district\n\ncourt's  conclusion that  the  case was  sufficiently unusual  to\n\nwarrant  departure is plenary, but we will set aside that court's\n\ndetermination that  the relied-upon facts actually  exist only if\n\nthey are clearly erroneous.  D az-Villafa e, 874 F.2d at 49.\r                                                     \n\n          The  sentencing  judge  in  an  abundance  of   caution\n\narticulated  his reasons  for  departing under  the authority  of\n\n  4A1.3.    That  section  permits  an  upward  departure when  a\n\ndefendant's   criminal  history  category  \"does  not  adequately\n\nreflect the seriousness of  the defendant's past criminal conduct\n\nor  the likelihood  that [he]  will commit  other crimes . . . .\"\n\nUnited States v. Fahm,  13 F.3d 447, 449 (1st  Cir. 1994)(quoting\r                               \n\nU.S.S.G.    4A1.3 (policy statement)).  Thirteen or more criminal\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nhistory points place a defendant in criminal history category VI;\n\naccording to  the presentence  report, Parkinson  had accumulated\n\ntwenty-three.  Given the notable difference between the criterion\n\nfor category VI and defendant's score, the upward departure rests\n\non solid  legal ground.  See United States v. Brown, 899 F.2d 94,\r                                                             \n\n97  (1st  Cir.  1990)  (upward departure  from  criminal  history\n\ncategory  VI  justified  by defendant's  twenty  criminal history\n\npoints).    Further,  strong  evidence  exists  that,  given  the\n\nopportunity,  defendant  will  continue  to  engage  in  criminal\n\nactivity.    The two  bank  robberies discussed  in  this opinion\n\noccurred  within one  month of  his release  from a  fifteen-year\n\nsentence.   The extent of defendant's  criminal history, combined\n\nwith  his  proclivity   for  repeat  performances,   warrant  the\n\nconclusion  that   the  guidelines  underestimate  his  level  of\n\ncriminality.  See Fahm, 13 F.3d at 450; Brown, 899 F.2d at 98.\r                                                       \n\n          Finally,  Parkinson  challenges  the  adequacy  of  the\n\ndistrict  court's  documentation of  the  factual  basis for  the\r                                          \n\ndeparture.  He questions neither the reliability nor the accuracy\n\nof the evidence upon which the district court explicitly  relied.\n\nSee Fahm, 13 F.3d at 450.  The district court need not state each\r                  \n\nand  every fact  that  supports the  departure.

After a one-day jury trial, defendant was convicted of robbing a bank in Portland, Maine, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2113(a) (1991).  He subsequently was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 240 months, to run consecutively to the remainder of a ten-to-twenty year sentence imposed by a Massachusetts state court for the robbery of a bank in Boston, Massachusetts.  On appeal, we affirmed the conviction, but vacated the sentence because the district court had not followed the directive of Sec. 5G1.3(c) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\" or \"Sentencing Guidelines\") when it imposed an entirely consecutive federal sentence.  United States v. Parkinson, No. 91-2233, 991 F.2d 786, 1993 WL 89801, at * 6 (1st Cir.  Mar. 30, 1993).

Defendant, ignoring the first part of the district judge's exegesis, presumes that the judge departed upwardly, and suggests that the issue before us is whether such departure was justified.  The government presents a more complete, and in our view correct, statement of the issues;  namely, is time served in state custody before the imposition of the federal sentence included in the calculus under Sec. 5G1.3(c) when deciding whether the sentence is outside the applicable guideline range;  and, only if so, was an upward departure in the instant case appropriate.  Because we answer the former inquiry in the negative, we need not reach the latter.  Nonetheless, a review of the record shows that an upward departure would be appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider de novo the legal meaning and scope of Sec. 5G1.3(c) (Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant Subject to an Undischarged Term of Imprisonment).  See United States v. Thompson, 32 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1994).  The district court's fact-finding, however, we review for clear error, with due deference given its application of Sec. 5G1.3(c) to the facts of the case.  See United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Was there a departure?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A perusal of Sec. 5G1.3 leads us to conclude that in order to determine whether a sentence imposed pursuant to Sec. 5G1.3(c) represents a departure from the guidelines, we do not consider time served in state custody.  To hold otherwise would equate \"sentence\" with \"total punishment\" and leave meaningless much of the language of Sec. 5G1.3, which we are bound to follow.  Like the policy statements, the commentary to the Sentencing Guidelines is binding when it \"interprets or explains a guideline ... unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\"  Stinson v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1915, 1918, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993).  Similarly, even \" '[p]ortions of [the Guidelines Manual] not labeled as guidelines or commentary ... are to be construed as commentary and thus have the force of policy statements.' \"  Id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1918 (quoting U.S.S.G.

U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.3.  Although there is discretion as to how to accomplish the incremental punishment, in fashioning an appropriate sentence, the district court is constrained by the Sentencing Guidelines.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.3, comment. n. 3;  28 U.S.C.A. Sec. 994(a) (West 1993).  The court should use the following method to reach the sentence:  (1) compute the total offense level for the instant offense and defendant's criminal history category;  (2) determine the resulting guideline range for that offense;  and (3) choose the point within the guideline range that effects a reasonable incremental punishment and decide whether that sentence will run concurrently or consecutively.  See United States v. Jackson, 30 F.3d 199, 201 (1st Cir.1994) (citing 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(a), (b) (1988));  U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.3, comment. n. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The commentary to Sec. 5G1.3 instructs that, to compute such an incremental punishment, a sentencing judge should consider the guideline grouping rules of Sec. 5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) which defines the total punishment that the defendant would have received had he been simultaneously sentenced in federal court for both offenses.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.3;  Parkinson, 1993 WL 89801, at * 4.  Under Sec. 5G1.2, an offense level and criminal history category for the combined offenses establish a guideline range, from which the total punishment is derived.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.2, comment.  Often, by discounting the total punishment for time already served on the undischarged sentence, the sentencing judge can attain an incremental punishment.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Confusion in this case arises from two unusual circumstances.  First, the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction is well below the upper end of the guideline range.  Second, because of defendant's extensive criminal record (23 criminal history points;  10 above the maximum, category VI), the Sec. 5G1.2 calculation results in the same guideline range as that arrived at pursuant to Sec. 2B3.1 for the instant bank robbery offense.  In most cases, the latter would be less than the former and the total punishment would not exceed the hypothetical range for the combined offenses.  Nevertheless, the Sentencing Commission carefully distinguished a \"sentence for the instant offense\" from the \"total punishment.\"   See generally U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.3.  Therefore, when determining whether the sentencing judge departed from the guideline range, we look at the sentence imposed for the instant offense, not the total punishment.  This is appropriate even were the total punishment beyond the range calculated under Sec. 5G1.2, because that section is a guide, not a mandate.  See Sec. 5G1.3, comment. n. 3 (instructing court to \"consider\" Sec. 5G1.2 \"to the extent practicable\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court correctly looked to the guideline for the offense of conviction, Sec. 2B3.1, and found that Parkinson had an offense level of 32 and, as a career offender, a criminal history category of VI.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.3, comment, n. 3(D) (illustrating that, absent departure, sentence must fall within the guideline range for the instant offense).  Although this combination would ordinarily yield a guideline range of 210 to 262 months, as noted above, the statutory cap on the offense of conviction here was 240 months.  18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 2113(a) (West 1994).  Thus, the imposed 240-month sentence, to be served concurrently with the undischarged portion of Parkinson's ten-to-twenty year state sentence, was not a departure from the guideline range for the instant offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>Would a departure have been justified?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we hold that the sentence was within the guideline range, a departure in this case would be warranted in any event.  This Court reviews the sentencing court's decision to depart using a three-step inquiry:  first, are the circumstances of the case sufficiently unusual to justify departure, United States v. Quinones, 26 F.3d 213, 217 (1st Cir.1994);  second, do the relied-upon factual circumstances actually exist, United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 950 (1st Cir.1993);  and third, is the departure reasonable, Jackson, 30 F.3d at 202 n. 3.   See generally United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 49 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 862, 110 S.Ct. 177, 107 L.Ed.2d 133 (1989).  Because defendant does not challenge the reasonableness of the departure, we discuss only the first two steps below.  Our review of the district court's conclusion that the case was sufficiently unusual to warrant departure is plenary, but we will set aside that court's determination that the relied-upon facts actually exist only if they are clearly erroneous.  Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 49.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing judge in an abundance of caution articulated his reasons for departing under the authority of Sec. 4A1.3.  That section permits an upward departure when a defendant's criminal history category \"does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct or the likelihood that [he] will commit other crimes....\"  United States v. Fahm, 13 F.3d 447, 449 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.3 (policy statement)).  Thirteen or more criminal history points place a defendant in criminal history category VI;  according to the presentence report, Parkinson had accumulated twenty-three.  Given the notable difference between the criterion for category VI and defendant's score, the upward departure rests on solid legal ground.  See United States v. Brown, 899 F.2d 94, 97 (1st Cir.1990) (upward departure from criminal history category VI justified by defendant's twenty criminal history points).  Further, strong evidence exists that, given the opportunity, defendant will continue to engage in criminal activity.  The two bank robberies discussed in this opinion occurred within one month of his release from a fifteen-year sentence.  The extent of defendant's criminal history, combined with his proclivity for repeat performances, warrant the conclusion that the guidelines underestimate his level of criminality.  See Fahm, 13 F.3d at 450;  Brown, 899 F.2d at 98.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Parkinson challenges the adequacy of the district court's documentation of the factual basis for the departure.  He questions neither the reliability nor the accuracy of the evidence upon which the district court explicitly relied.  See Fahm, 13 F.3d at 450.   The district court need not state each and every fact that supports the departure.  Rather, it is sufficient that the judge specifically identified his findings as those set out in the presentence report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the sentence is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At resentencing, the court, without dissent from either party, applied the 1993 Sentencing Guidelines.

Therefore, when determining whether the sentencing judge departed from the guideline range, we look at the sentence imposed for the instant offense, not the total punishment.  This is appropriate even were the total punishment beyond the range calculated under Sec. 5G1.2, because that section is a guide, not a mandate.  See Sec. 5G1.3, comment. n. 3 (instructing court to \"consider\" Sec. 5G1.2 \"to the extent practicable\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court correctly looked to the guideline for the offense of conviction, Sec. 2B3.1, and found that Parkinson had an offense level of 32 and, as a career offender, a criminal history category of VI.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.3, comment, n. 3(D) (illustrating that, absent departure, sentence must fall within the guideline range for the instant offense).  Although this combination would ordinarily yield a guideline range of 210 to 262 months, as noted above, the statutory cap on the offense of conviction here was 240 months.  18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 2113(a) (West 1994).  Thus, the imposed 240-month sentence, to be served concurrently with the undischarged portion of Parkinson's ten-to-twenty year state sentence, was not a departure from the guideline range for the instant offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>Would a departure have been justified?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we hold that the sentence was within the guideline range, a departure in this case would be warranted in any event.  This Court reviews the sentencing court's decision to depart using a three-step inquiry:  first, are the circumstances of the case sufficiently unusual to justify departure, United States v. Quinones, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672030\"><a href=\"/opinion/672030/united-states-v-jesus-m-quinones-aka-jesus-m-quinones-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 217 (1st Cir.1994);  second, do the relied-upon factual circumstances actually exist, United States v. Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span>, 950 (1st Cir.1993);  and third, is the departure reasonable, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195501\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Jackson,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195501/united-states-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">202</span> </a></span>n. 3.   See generally United States v. Diaz-Villafane, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522865\"><a href=\"/opinion/522865/united-states-v-wilfredo-diaz-villafane/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">862</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span> </span>(1989).  Because defendant does not challenge the reasonableness of the departure, we discuss only the first two steps below.  Our review of the district court's conclusion that the case was sufficiently unusual to warrant departure is plenary, but we will set aside that court's determination that the relied-upon facts actually exist only if they are clearly erroneous.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522865\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Diaz-Villafane,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/522865/united-states-v-wilfredo-diaz-villafane/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing judge in an abundance of caution articulated his reasons for departing under the authority of Sec. 4A1.3.  That section permits an upward departure when a defendant's criminal history category \"does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct or the likelihood that [he] will commit other crimes....\"  United States v. Fahm, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195128\"><a href=\"/opinion/195128/united-states-v-fahm/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span>, 449 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.3 (policy statement)).  Thirteen or more criminal history points place a defendant in criminal history category VI;  according to the presentence report, Parkinson had accumulated twenty-three.  Given the notable difference between the criterion for category VI and defendant's score, the upward departure rests on solid legal ground.  See United States v. Brown, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538793\"><a href=\"/opinion/538793/united-states-v-richard-c-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 97 (1st Cir.1990) (upward departure from criminal history category VI justified by defendant's twenty criminal history points).  Further, strong evidence exists that, given the opportunity, defendant will continue to engage in criminal activity.  The two bank robberies discussed in this opinion occurred within one month of his release from a fifteen-year sentence.  The extent of defendant's criminal history, combined with his proclivity for repeat performances, warrant the conclusion that the guidelines underestimate his level of criminality.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195128\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Fahm,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195128/united-states-v-fahm/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span>;  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538793\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Brown,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/538793/united-states-v-richard-c-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Parkinson challenges the adequacy of the district court's documentation of the factual basis for the departure.  He questions neither the reliability nor the accuracy of the evidence upon which the district court explicitly relied.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195128\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Fahm,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195128/united-states-v-fahm/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span>.   The district court need not state each and every fact that supports the departure.  Rather, it is sufficient that the judge specifically identified his findings as those set out in the presentence report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the sentence is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At resentencing, the court, without dissent from either party, applied the 1993 Sentencing Guidelines.

Both calculations are based upon a criminal history category of VI and total offense level of 32.  Defendant does not dispute either</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
