In April 1989,  Patrick Casey was traveling\n               \n\nin New Hampshire in a Subaru owned and driven by his fiancee,\n\nSusan  Donahue.  Seeing an  injured dog in  the lane directly\n\nahead of them, Donahue  parked in the breakdown lane.   Casey\n\ngot  out and  picked up the  dog in  order to  take him  to a\n\nveterinarian.   While Casey was  returning to the  Subaru but\n\nstill  about ten feet  away from its  rear, he was  struck by\n\nanother  car and severely injured.   The driver  of the other\n\ncar, caught after a chase,  had a blood alcohol level of  .22\n\nper  cent,  was  violating  a  license  restriction requiring\n\ncorrective lenses, and had no liability insurance coverage in\n\neffect.  \n\n     Casey  eventually  sued  Metropolitan Insurance  Company\n\nwhich  had insured  Donahue's Subaru.   Casey  claimed to  be\n\ncovered  by the  uninsured  driver provisions  of the  policy\n\nwhich are described below, but Metropolitan  denied coverage.\n\nCasey's suit,  brought in  the New Hampshire  superior court,\n\nwas removed to federal court.  On May 17, 1993, the  district\n\ncourt, based  on stipulated facts, ruled  on summary judgment\n\nthat  Casey  was not  covered  under  the uninsured  motorist\n\nportion of the policy.1  \n\n     After  the  district  court's  ruling on  the  uninsured\n\nmotorist provision, Casey filed a motion to reform the policy\n\n                    \n\n     1The court also held that Casey was entitled to benefits\nunder the  policy's  personal injury  protection  provisions.\nMetropolitan does not challenge the latter ruling.\n\n                             -2-\n\nto have himself listed  as an additional named insured.   The\n\nmagistrate-judge  rejected this motion,  the trial upheld the\n\nruling, and  a final  judgment was  entered.   Casey's appeal\n\nfollowed.  We affirm.\n\n     At the  threshold, we note that  the Metropolitan policy\n\nstated that it was a contract made under,  and incorporating,\n\nMassachusetts laws relating to automobile insurance.  Donahue\n\nand  Casey  lived  in   Massachusetts,  and  the  Subaru  was\n\nregistered  there.    On  appeal,  Casey  suggests  that  New\n\nHampshire  law may  be pertinent  insofar as  its declaratory\n\naction  statute under which  Casey sued places  the burden of\n\nproof  to disprove  coverage on  the insurance  company, N.H.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann.   491:22-a, and New Hampshire courts construe\n\nambiguities against the insurer.  State Farm Mutual Auto Ins.\n                                                             \n\nCo. v. Cookinham, 604 A.2d 563 (N.H. 1992).\n                \n\n     Massachusetts  law appears  to  be otherwise  as to  the\n\nburden of proof.  See Kelleher v. American Mutual Ins. Co. of\n                                                             \n\nBoston,  590  N.E.2d  1178,  1180 (Mass.  App.  Ct.),  review\n                                                             \n\ndenied, 597 N.E.2d  444 (Mass. 1992).   Similarly, where  (as\n      \n\nhere) the standard policy  language is prescribed by statute,\n\nMassachusetts courts do not construe the language against the\n\ninsurer.   Bilodeau  v. Lumbermens  Mutual Casualty  Co., 467\n                                                       \n\nN.E.2d  137, 140  (1984).   It  appears  to us  that the  New\n\nHampshire courts would apply  Massachusetts law in this case,\n\nsince the  policy was made  and the  car kept in  that state.\n\n                             -3-\n\nSee Glowski v.  Allstate Ins.  Co., 589 A.2d  593, 595  (N.H.\n                                 \n\n1991);  cf. Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric Mfg. Co., 313 U.S.\n                                                  \n\n487 (1941)  (in diversity cases  the forum state's  choice of\n\nlaw rules govern).   As it  happens, the burden  of proof  is\n\nirrelevant where the facts are  stipulated, and the policy is\n\nnot ambiguous.\n\n     We assume  favorably to  Casey that \"the  application of\n\npolicy language to known facts presents a question of law for\n\nthe  court,\" Kelleher, 590 N.E.2d  at 1180, and  in any event\n                     \n\nour review of  summary judgment  is plenary.   The  uninsured\n\nmotorist  portion of the  policy, in describing  the scope of\n\ncoverage, states that \"[w]e will pay  damages to or for . . .\n\n`[y]ou, or any household  member' or `[a]nyone occupying your\n\nauto with your consent at the  time of the accident.'\"  Casey\n\nclaims coverage under each of these three alternatives.\n\n     We begin with  the reference to \"you.\"  The introductory\n\nsection of the policy states that \"[t]his insurance policy is\n\na  legal contract  between  the policy  owner  (you) and  the\n\ncompany (we or us).\"  The \"definitions\" section then provided\n\nthat \"[y]ou or [y]our . . . refers to the person named on the\n\nCoverage Selections  Page.\"  The  page in question  states as\n\nitem 1 that \"this policy is issued to:  SUSAN R DONAHUE.\"\n\n     We  think it is apparent that Donahue, and not Casey, is\n\nthe  \"you\" in question.  Although Casey's name appears on the\n\nsame  page, it is only  in the \"operator information\" section\n\n                             -4-\n\nas an additional driver of the insured vehicle.  In Santos v.\n                                                          \n\nLumbermen's Mutual  Casualty Co., 556 N.E.2d  983, 986 (Mass.\n                               \n\n1990), the Supreme Judicial Court construed identical  policy\n\nlanguage, finding that \"`[y]ou,' . . . refers to the owner of\n\neach policy.\"  Accord Pisani  v. Travelers Insurance Co., 560\n                                                       \n\nN.E.2d 155 (Mass. App. Ct. 1990). \n\n     We also  reject Casey's  claim that  he qualifies as  \"a\n\nmember of Donahue's household.\"  Casey and Donahue, who later\n\nmarried,  resided together  at the  time of the  accident and\n\nshared expenses including the  policy premiums.  If  the term\n\nwere used generically, Casey  would have a colorable argument\n\nthat he was a member of Donahue's \"household.\"  Unfortunately\n\nfor him,  the policy  defines \"household member\"  narrowly as\n\nmeaning \"anyone  living in your  household who is  related to\n\nyou by blood,  marriage, or adoption.\"   At the  time of  the\n\naccident Casey was not related to Donahue by blood, marriage,\n\nor  adoption, and thus  fails to qualify  under this explicit\n\nand unambiguous requirement.\n\n     Vaiarella  v.  Hanover Ins.  Co.,  567  N.E.2d 916,  919\n                                    \n\n(Mass.  1991), relied upon  by Casey,  is not  in point.   It\n\ninvolved  a  mother  who  sought  coverage  under  her  son's\n\nuninsured motorist  policy; as mother and  son were obviously\n\nrelated  by blood, the question  of concern to  the court was\n\nwhether  the  mother  was  \"living  in  [the  policyholder's]\n\nhousehold.\"  The  court never suggested  that a close  friend\n\n                             -5-\n\nwho  lived in the same house  and acted in a motherly fashion\n\ncould be deemed to be  \"related . . . by blood,  marriage, or\n\nadoption.\"\n\n     Casey's   final  argument  is  that  when  the  accident\n\noccurred he  was \"occupying\"  the vehicle with  the Donahue's\n\nconsent.   The  Metropolitan  policy  defines \"occupying\"  as\n\nembracing one who is \"in, upon, entering into, or getting out\n\nof\" the insured vehicle.   Casey cites a number of cases from\n\njurisdictions other than Massachusetts that have dramatically\n                   \n\nexpanded the definition of  \"occupying\" in the auto insurance\n\ncontext.2\n\n     Massachusetts  courts,  however,  have  given  the  term\n\n\"occupying\"  in  auto  insurance  contracts  a  more  limited\n\nmeaning.   In  Kelleher,  590 N.E.2d  at  1180, Kelleher  was\n                       \n\nstruck by an uninsured motorist just after getting out of his\n\nvehicle and  starting to cross the  street; although Kelleher\n\nwas approximately three to four feet away  at the time of the\n\naccident,  the  court  held  that  Kelleher  had  \"completely\n\nsevered his relationship  with the  vehicle.\"   Id. at  1180.\n                                                   \n\nEven if Kelleher could be distinguished, somewhat doubtfully,\n                \n\nbecause the claimant was leaving rather than returning to the\n\ncar,  a second  Massachusetts case is  even more  damaging to\n\n                    \n\n     2See, e.g., State Farm v. Cookinham,  604 A.2d 563 (N.H.\n                                        \n1992);  Horace Mann Ins. Co. v. Neuville, 465 N.W.2d 432, 434\n                                        \n(Minn.  Ct. App. 1991); Miller v. Loman, 518 N.E.2d 486 (Ind.\n                                       \nCt. App. 1987).\n\n                             -6-\n\nCasey.    In Rosebrooks  v.  National General  Ins.  Co., 434\n                                                       \n\nN.E.2d 675 (Mass.  App. Ct.), review denied, 440  N.E.2d 1177\n                                           \n\n(Mass. 1982),  the court  found that the  claimant Rosebrooks\n\nwas not \"entering\"  the insured vehicle  even though she  was\n\nabout to enter the car,  was two to three feet from  the door\n\nhandle when she fell,  and was touching the vehicle  with her\n\nhand at the moment of the accident.  Id. at 677.\n                                        \n\n     It  is   sad  that  Casey,  commendably   engaged  in  a\n\nhumanitarian gesture when injured, should apparently  be left\n\nwith little insurance protection  for what were clearly awful\n\ninjuries.   But we are not  free to alter what  appears to be\n\nthe reasonably clear message of Massachusetts precedents.  If\n\nMassachusetts wishes  to follow  what Casey has  described as\n\n\"the clear modern  trend of  case law\" to  embrace a  broader\n\nmeaning of  \"occupying,\"  that  step  must be  taken  by  the\n\nMassachusetts courts.  We conclude that Casey falls into none\n\nof  the   three  alternative  categories   that  qualify  for\n\nuninsured motorists protection under this policy.\n\n     Finally, Casey seeks review of the  refusal to allow him\n\nto amend  his complaint, after summary  judgment against him,\n\nto seek  reformation of the  Metropolitan policy in  order to\n\nlist  him as an additional named insured.  Even assuming that\n\nDonahue and  Casey were under  a mistaken apprehension  as to\n\ncoverage,  there is  no reason  to believe  that Metropolitan\n\nshared  this  misapprehension,  creating  a  \"mutual  mistake\n\n                             -7-\n\n[which] is reformable,\"  Polaroid Corp.  v. Travelers  Indem.\n                                                             \n\nCo.,  610  N.E.2d 912,  917 (Mass.  1993),  nor is  there any\n  \n\nindication that this is a case  of mistake \"made by one party\n\nand   known  to  the  other   party.\"    Id.     Under  these\n                                            \n\ncircumstances, and in light of the failure of Casey to assert\n\nthis claim  before summary judgment had  been granted against\n\nhim,  we think that  there is no  abuse of discretion  in the\n\ndistrict court's refusal to grant  the belated motion to  add\n\nthe  new claim.

App. Ct. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject Casey's claim that he qualifies as \"a member of Donahue's household.\"  Casey and Donahue, who later married, resided together at the time of the accident and shared expenses including the policy premiums.  If the term were used generically, Casey would have a colorable argument that he was a member of Donahue's \"household.\"  Unfortunately for him, the policy defines \"household member\" narrowly as meaning \"anyone living in your household who is related to you by blood, marriage, or adoption.\"  At the time of the accident Casey was not related to Donahue by blood, marriage, or adoption, and thus fails to qualify under this explicit and unambiguous requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vaiarella v. Hanover Ins. Co., 567 N.E.2d 916, 919 (Mass. 1991), relied upon by Casey, is not in point.  It involved a mother who sought coverage under her son's uninsured motorist policy;  as mother and son were obviously related by blood, the question of concern to the court was whether the mother was \"living in [the policyholder's] household.\"  The court never suggested that a close friend who lived in the same house and acted in a motherly fashion could be deemed to be \"related ... by blood, marriage, or adoption.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casey's final argument is that when the accident occurred he was \"occupying\" the vehicle with the Donahue's consent.  The Metropolitan policy defines \"occupying\" as embracing one who is \"in, upon, entering into, or getting out of\" the insured vehicle.  Casey cites a number of cases from jurisdictions other than Massachusetts that have dramatically expanded the definition of \"occupying\" in the auto insurance context.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts courts, however, have given the term \"occupying\" in auto insurance contracts a more limited meaning.  In  Kelleher, 590 N.E.2d at 1180, Kelleher was struck by an uninsured motorist just after getting out of his vehicle and starting to cross the street;  although Kelleher was approximately three to four feet away at the time of the accident, the court held that Kelleher had \"completely severed his relationship with the vehicle.\"   Id. at 1180.  Even if Kelleher could be distinguished, somewhat doubtfully, because the claimant was leaving rather than returning to the car, a second Massachusetts case is even more damaging to Casey.  In  Rosebrooks v. National General Ins. Co., 434 N.E.2d 675 (Mass.  App. Ct.), review denied, 440 N.E.2d 1177 (Mass. 1982), the court found that the claimant Rosebrooks was not \"entering\" the insured vehicle even though she was about to enter the car, was two to three feet from the door handle when she fell, and was touching the vehicle with her hand at the moment of the accident.  Id. at 677.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is sad that Casey, commendably engaged in a humanitarian gesture when injured, should apparently be left with little insurance protection for what were clearly awful injuries.  But we are not free to alter what appears to be the reasonably clear message of Massachusetts precedents.  If Massachusetts wishes to follow what Casey has described as \"the clear modern trend of case law\" to embrace a broader meaning of \"occupying,\" that step must be taken by the Massachusetts courts.  We conclude that Casey falls into none of the three alternative categories that qualify for uninsured motorists protection under this policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Casey seeks review of the refusal to allow him to amend his complaint, after summary judgment against him, to seek reformation of the Metropolitan policy in order to list him as an additional named insured.  Even assuming that Donahue and Casey were under a mistaken apprehension as to coverage, there is no reason to believe that Metropolitan shared this misapprehension, creating a \"mutual mistake [which] is reformable,\"  Polaroid Corp. v. Travelers Indem.  Co., 610 N.E.2d 912, 917 (Mass. 1993), nor is there any indication that this is a case of mistake \"made by one party and known to the other party.\"  Id. Under these circumstances, and in light of the failure of Casey to assert this claim before summary judgment had been granted against him, we think that there is no abuse of discretion in the district court's refusal to grant the belated motion to add the new claim.

Josephthal &amp; Co., 814 F.2d 798, 806 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court also held that Casey was entitled to benefits under the policy's personal injury protection provisions.

Seeing an injured dog in the lane directly ahead of them, Donahue parked in the breakdown lane.  Casey got out and picked up the dog in order to take him to a veterinarian.  While Casey was returning to the Subaru but still about ten feet away from its rear, he was struck by another car and severely injured.  The driver of the other car, caught after a chase, had a blood alcohol level of .22 per cent, was violating a license restriction requiring corrective lenses, and had no liability insurance coverage in effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casey eventually sued Metropolitan Insurance Company which had insured Donahue's Subaru.  Casey claimed to be covered by the uninsured driver provisions of the policy which are described below, but Metropolitan denied coverage.  Casey's suit, brought in the New Hampshire superior court, was removed to federal court.  On May 17, 1993, the district court, based on stipulated facts, ruled on summary judgment that Casey was not covered under the uninsured motorist portion of the policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court's ruling on the uninsured motorist provision, Casey filed a motion to reform the policy to have himself listed as an additional named insured.  The magistrate-judge rejected this motion, the trial upheld the ruling, and a final judgment was entered.  Casey's appeal followed.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the threshold, we note that the Metropolitan policy stated that it was a contract made under, and incorporating, Massachusetts laws relating to automobile insurance.  Donahue and Casey lived in Massachusetts, and the Subaru was registered there.  On appeal, Casey suggests that New Hampshire law may be pertinent insofar as its declaratory action statute under which Casey sued places the burden of proof to disprove coverage on the insurance company, N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann. Sec. 491:22-a, and New Hampshire courts construe ambiguities against the insurer.   State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co. v. Cookinham, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span> </span>(N.H. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts law appears to be otherwise as to the burden of proof.

Co. of Boston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2040991\"><a href=\"/opinion/2040991/kelleher-v-american-mutual-ins-co-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1178</span></a></span>, 1180 (Mass.

Similarly, where (as here) the standard policy language is prescribed by statute, Massachusetts courts do not construe the language against the insurer.   Bilodeau v. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2027015\"><a href=\"/opinion/2027015/bilodeau-v-lumbermens-mutual-casualty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, 140 (1984).  It appears to us that the New Hampshire courts would apply Massachusetts law in this case, since the policy was made and the car kept in that state.   See Glowski v. Allstate Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></span>, 595 (N.H. 1991);   cf.  Klaxon Co. v.

As it happens, the burden of proof is irrelevant where the facts are stipulated, and the policy is not ambiguous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume favorably to Casey that \"the application of policy language to known facts presents a question of law for the court,\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2040991\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Kelleher,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2040991/kelleher-v-american-mutual-ins-co-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1180</span></a></span>, and in any event our review of summary judgment is plenary.  The uninsured motorist portion of the policy, in describing the scope of coverage, states that \"[w]e will pay damages to or for ... '[y]ou, or any household member' or '[a]nyone occupying your auto with your consent at the time of the accident.' \"  Casey claims coverage under each of these three alternatives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the reference to \"you.\"  The introductory section of the policy states that \"[t]his insurance policy is a legal contract between the policy owner (you) and the company (we or us).\"  The \"definitions\" section then provided that \"[y]ou or [y]our ... refers to the person named on the Coverage Selections Page.\"  The page in question states as item 1 that \"this policy is issued to:  SUSAN R DONAHUE.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it is apparent that Donahue, and not Casey, is the \"you\" in question.  Although Casey's name appears on the same page, it is only in the \"operator information\" section as an additional driver of the insured vehicle.  In Santos v.
