The case was removed to the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico on Crowley's theory  that Appellants'\n\nclaims  under Mandatory  Decree No. 38  were preempted  by ERISA.\n\nRosario-Cordero  v. Crowley Towing &amp; Transp. Co., 850 F. Supp. 98\r                                                          \n\n(D.P.R. 1994).   Ruling on Crowley's motion for summary judgment,\n\nthe district court held  that the Appellants' claims  were indeed\n\npreempted by ERISA.  Id.  at 102.  For the following  reasons, we\r                                 \n\naffirm.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\n\n          Crowley  operates a  tugboat operation  covering Puerto\n\nRico, ports  in the continental  United States,  the U.S.  Virgin\n\nIslands,  and some international ports.   The nature of Crowley's\n\noperations  requires its  employees  to travel  to the  different\n\nports to provide tug services.\n\n          Most   of  Crowley's  employees   are  members  of  the\n\nSeafarers' International Union, Atlantic, Gulf, Lakes and  Inland\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nWaters  District, AFL-CIO  (the  \"Union\").   During all  relevant\n\nperiods,  Appellants were members of the Union, and the Union was\n\ntheir  exclusive  bargaining  representative.     Pursuant  to  a\n\nCollective  Bargaining  Agreement  (the  \"CBA\"),  the  Union  and\n\nCrowley  agreed to  participate in  the Seafarers'  Vacation Plan\n\n(the \"Plan\"). \n\n          The Plan is a multiemployer employee benefit plan which\n\nprovides  vacation benefits to the employees of its members.  The\n\nPlan is structured and governed in accordance with ERISA.   It is\n\nadministered by an Administrator.  The Administrator, in turn, is\n\nappointed  by the Plan's twelve-member Board of Trustees.  Six of\n\nthe Trustees are appointed by the  Union and the other six by the\n\nparticipating employers.\n\n          The Plan provides for the establishment of  a fund from\n\ncontributions   from   the    participating   employers.      The\n\ncontributions are deposited in  the Plan's bank accounts.   These\n\nfunds,  which contain only Plan monies,  are held in trust, and a\n\nportion of the assets are invested in bonds and notes.  The funds\n\nare used  to pay vacation benefits to  the eligible participants,\n\nand to cover  the Plan's  administrative costs.   Under the  CBA,\n\nCrowley  was required to make periodic  contributions to the Plan\n\nfor each employee.\n\n          The  Plan triggers  vacation pay  when an  employee has\n\nworked seventy-five days in a  fifteen-month period, irrespective\n\nof whether the  employee intends  to actually  take the  vacation\n\nleave.   During their employment, both Appellants applied for and\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nreceived the vacation  payment due them  under the Plan's  terms,\n\nalthough  they did not take  the vacation leave.   Appellants are\n\nnow retired.\n\n          Despite their  receipt of vacation pay  under the Plan,\n\nAppellants filed  suit against  Crowley, claiming that  they were\n\nnever  allowed to take their vacation leave as mandated by Puerto\n\nRico's  Mandatory  Decree No.  38, (the  \"Decree\").1   The Decree\n\nprovides in relevant part:\n\n            Every  employee  shall  be   entitled  to\n            vacation  leave with  full pay  to become\n            effective when he begins to  enjoy it, at\n            the rate of one and five twelves [sic] (1\n            5/12) days for each month in which he has\n            worked  at least one hundred (100) hours.\n            This  leave  is  equivalent to  seventeen\n            (17) workdays per year. . . .\n\n            The employer who  does not  grant any  of\n            his employees the vacation leave to which\n            he  is entitled  after having  accrued it\n            for two  (2) years,  shall grant  him the\n            total thus far accrued, paying  him twice\n            (2)  the wage corresponding to the period\n            accrued in excess of  said two years. . .\n            .\n\n            Any contract whereby the employee waives,\n            for  money  or  other consideration,  his\n            right to actually take his vacation leave\n            shall be unlawful and void.\n\nAppellants  claim, therefore,  that Crowley  is obligated  to pay\n\nthem  a sum  equivalent to  seventeen days  of work  per year  of\n\n                    \r                              \n\n1  The  Decree is one  of 43 decrees  promulgated by the  Minimum\nWage Board of Puerto Rico.   The Board is authorized by Section 2\nof the  Minimum Wage Act of Puerto Rico, 29 L.P.R.A.   245(a), to\nestablish  mandatory decrees regarding  the working conditions of\nparticular  industries.    These  decrees  are  quasi-legislative\ndocuments with the force  of law.  Mendoza v.

We must determine whether the\n\nrecord,  viewed in  the light  most  favorable to  the non-moving\n\nAppellants  and with  all  reasonable inferences  drawn in  their\n\nfavor,  presents no  genuine  issue  of  material fact  and  thus\n\nentitles  Crowley to judgment as a matter of law.

Preemption Under ERISA Generally\r                                                        \n\n          As the  Appellants correctly  point out, preemption  of\n\nstate law  is generally disfavored.  McCoy v. Massachusetts Inst.\r                                                                           \n\nof Technology, 950 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1991).  This presumption\r                       \n\nagainst  preemption is, however, not absolute.  When Congress has\n\nexpressly  so  provided,  federal  preemption  of  state  law  is\n\nmandated under the Supremacy Clause.  Id.\r                                                  \n\n          ERISA preemption is, as  a general matter, expansive in\n\nscope.   McCoy, 950  F.2d at  16.   In  formulating the  statute,\r                        \n\nCongress  included  a  sweeping   preemption  clause,     514(a),\n\ncommanding  that ERISA \"shall  supersede any  and all  State laws\n\ninsofar  as  they may  now or  hereafter  relate to  any employee\r                                                                           \n\nbenefit  plan.\"   29  U.S.C.    1144(a)  (emphasis added).    For\r                       \n\npreemption  purposes,  \"State  laws\"  are  \"all  laws, decisions,\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nrules, regulations, or  other State action  having the effect  of\n\nlaw.\"  29 U.S.C.   1144(c)(1).  Puerto Rico is expressly included\n\nin the statute's definition of \"State.\"  29 U.S.C.   1002(10).\n\n          The   United  States   Supreme  Court   has  repeatedly\n\nexplained  that a state law \"relates to\" an employee benefit plan\n\n\"'if it  has a connection  with or  reference to  such a  plan.'\"\n\nDistrict  of Columbia v. Greater Washington Bd. of Trade,    U.S.\r                                                                  \n\n  , 113  S. Ct. 580, 583 (1992) (quoting Shaw v.

Moreover, a state law  may\r                   \n\n\"relate to\"  an employee benefit  plan and thereby  be preempted,\n\neven  if  the law  is not  specifically  designed to  affect such\n\nplans,  and even if its  effect is indirect.   Greater Washington\r                                                                           \n\nBd. of Trade,    U.S. at   , 113 S.

Simas  v. Quaker Fabric  Corp. of Fall  River, 6\r                                                                        \n\nF.3d 849, 852 (1st Cir. 1993) (citations omitted).\n\n          Therefore, a state law with even an  indirect effect on\n\nan ERISA-covered  benefit plan is preempted, even though ERISA by\n\nits  terms may not necessarily  address the topic  covered by the\n\nstate law.  For example, a state law is preempted if it restricts\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nthe  choices  of a  benefit  plan  regarding its  administration,\n\nstructure,  or benefits.

Fort Halifax Packing\r                                                                           \n\nCo. v. Coyne, 482 U.S. 1, 15 (1987).   Yet, as we have explained,\r                      \n\n\"the  reason for  the broad  preemption provision  is clear:   By\n\npreventing  states  from  imposing divergent  obligations,  ERISA\n\nallows each employer  to create its  own uniform plan,  complying\n\nwith  only one  set  of rules  (those of  ERISA)  and capable  of\n\napplying uniformly in all  jurisdictions where the employer might\n\noperate.\"  Simas, 6 F.3d at 852.\r                          \n\n          Finally, we  address  what plans  constitute  \"employee\n\nbenefit  plans\" for   514(a)'s purposes.  The district court ably\n\nset  forth the  applicable  law on  this  point in  its  opinion,\n\nCrowley, 850 F. Supp. at 100-101, and we  follow suit here merely\r                 \n\nfor  the sake  of thoroughness.   Section  3(3) of  ERISA defines\n\nemployee  benefit  plans as  plans that  are either  \"an employee\n\nwelfare  benefit plan,\" or \"an employee pension benefit plan,\" or\n\nboth.  29 U.S.C.   1002(3).  An employee welfare benefit plan, in\n\nturn, is defined as:\n\n            [A]ny  plan, fund,  or program  which was\n            heretofore or is hereafter established or\n            maintained  by  an   employer  or  by  an\n            employee organization, or by both, to the\n            extent that such  plan, fund, or  program\n            was established or  is maintained for the\n            purpose of providing for its participants\n            or  beneficiaries, (A)  .  .  .  vacation\r                                                               \n            benefits. . . .\r                              \n\n29 U.S.C.    1002(1) (emphasis  added).  ERISA  does not  further\n\ndefine \"plan,  fund  or program\"  or  \"vacation benefits.\"    The\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nSupreme Court, however, has  clearly stated that \"a multiemployer\n\nfund created to  provide vacation benefits for  union members who\n\ntypically  work for several employers during the course of a year\n\n. . .   undoubtedly  falls   within  the   scope  of   the  Act.\"\n\nMassachusetts v. Morash,  490 U.S.  107, 114 (1989).   The  Court\r                                 \n\ndistinguished such  multiemployer plans, where  vacation benefits\n\nare paid out  of a  separate fund established  for that  purpose,\n\nfrom a  single employer's  payroll practice of  awarding vacation\n\npay,  where the payments are  made out of  the employer's general\n\nassets.  The latter practices, the Court held, are not covered by\n\nERISA.  Morash, 490 U.S. at 113-114.  The Court went on to state:\r                        \n\n            [W]e  emphasize that  the case  before us\n            . . .  concern[s]  payments  by a  single\n            employer out of  its general assets.   An\n            entirely  different  situation  would  be\n            presented if  a  separate fund  had  been\n            created   by  a  group  of  employers  to\n            guarantee   the   payment   of   vacation\n            benefits to laborers who  regularly shift\n            their  jobs from one employer to another.\n            Employees who are a beneficiary of such a\n            trust  face far different  risks and have\n            far  greater need  for the  reporting and\n            disclosure  requirements [of  ERISA] than\n            those whose vacation  benefits come  from\n            the  same  fund from  which  they receive\n            their paychecks. \n\nMorash, 490 U.S. at 120.\r                \n\n          Given these  principles,  therefore, our  task  becomes\n\nclear.   We must determine 1)  whether the Plan at  issue in this\n\ncase is an \"employee benefit plan\" within the scope of ERISA, and\n\nif so, 2) whether the  Decree \"relates to\" the Plan.  If it does,\n\nthen  ERISA preempts the Decree and  Appellants' claims under the\n\nDecree are foreclosed.\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          C.  Is the Plan Covered by ERISA?\r                    C.  Is the Plan Covered by ERISA?\r                                                     \n\n          As  we explained  above,  the Plan  is a  multiemployer\n\nemployee benefit plan established and governed in accordance with\n\nERISA.  Under the Plan, employees, including the Appellants here,\n\nbecome  entitled   to  vacation  benefits   regardless  of  their\n\nemployer,  as long as they  work seventy-five days  in a fifteen-\n\nmonth  period.   Employees seeking  their vacation  benefits must\n\napply directly to  the Plan  Administrator to obtain  them.   The\n\nbenefits are then  paid to  employees out of  a segregated  trust\n\nfund  established solely  for that  purpose, and  not out  of the\n\ngeneral assets of any individual employer.\n\n          The  employers'  participation  in  the  Plan  consists\n\nsolely  of making  the  required contributions.   The  individual\n\nemployers, including Crowley, are not involved in the application\n\nfor  or the administration of the benefits.  In fact, the payment\n\nof vacation benefits  under the Plan  rests on contingencies  and\n\nprocesses  entirely  outside  of  the individual  employers'  and\n\nemployees' control.\n\n          It  seems clear to us  that this Plan  is precisely the\n\ntype of plan that  Congress intended to reach in  enacting ERISA.\n\nIt certainly falls squarely within the description, quoted above,\n\nset  forth  by the  Supreme  Court in  Morash, 490  U.S.  at 120.\r                                                       \n\nEmployee members of the  Plan are the beneficiaries of  the trust\n\nestablished for  the payment of their vacation benefits, and thus\n\nface the risks  of fund mismanagement  and payment failures  that\n\nERISA was intended to prevent.   If the Plan were not  covered by\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nERISA, all  of the Plan's participating  employees would suddenly\n\nbe exposed to these risks.   For these reasons, we find  that the\n\nPlan  at  issue here  is indeed  an  \"employee benefit  plan\" for\n\nERISA's   514(a) purposes.\n\n          D.  Does the Decree \"Relate to\" the Plan?\r                    D.  Does the Decree \"Relate to\" the Plan?\r                                                             \n\n          Appellants contend that the Decree does not \"relate to\"\n\nthe  Plan  because   1)  the   Decree  is  a   law  of   \"general\n\napplicability\" not aimed at the administration of ERISA plans; 2)\n\nthe  penalty imposed by the  Decree does not  constitute a \"plan\"\n\nsuch as ERISA is meant to regulate; and 3) if the cause of action\n\ncreated by  the Decree  were preempted,  employees would  be left\n\nwithout a remedy at law.  We address each of these contentions in\n\nturn.\n\n            1.  Is the Decree a \"law of general application\" with\r                      1.  Is the Decree a \"law of general application\" with\n            a connection \"too tenuous, remote, or  peripheral\" to\r                      a connection \"too tenuous, remote, or  peripheral\" to\n            relate to the Plan?\r                      relate to the Plan?\n\n          Appellants  claim  that  the  Decree  is  a  regulation\n\ndirected  at  all   employers  in  the  transportation   industry\n\nregardless of whether  they maintain an ERISA-covered  plan.  The\n\nDecree, they  explain, mandates and regulates  vacation leave and\n\nother working  conditions for the  protection of workers  in that\n\nindustry.  As  such, it is a law of general applicability neither\n\ndirected at nor predicated  upon the existence of an  ERISA plan,\n\nand thus does not \"relate to\" the Plan.\n\n          In support of their  argument on this point, Appellants\n\nsubmit an inaccurate statement  of the law.   Significantly, they\n\nincorrectly  rely   on   the  traditional   preemption   analysis\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\napplicable to  less comprehensive federal statutes,  arguing that\n\nthe  Decree here is not  preempted because it  does not interfere\n\nwith ERISA's overriding  concern of  protecting beneficiaries  of\n\nemployee benefit plans from fraud or misuse of plan funds.  As we\n\nhave  explained, however,  the broad  preemption clause  of ERISA\n\nobliges courts to  apply ERISA's preemptive  effects expansively,\n\nand  therefore the  preemption analysis  under ERISA  is entirely\n\ndifferent  than for other  federal statutes.   Thus, the narrower\n\npreemption  analysis   offered  by   the  Appellants   is  simply\n\ninapplicable here.2\n                    \r                              \n\n2   The Appellants also erroneously  rely on two cases to support\ntheir contentions.   First, they  cite our  decision in  Combined\r                                                                           \nManagement, 22 F.3d at 1, for the proposition that a state law is\r                    \nnot  preempted by  ERISA when  the law  is \"a  matter  of general\napplication affecting all private  employers, whether or not they\nhave adopted an ERISA plan,  and because the law does not  affect\nthe structure,  administration, or  type of benefits  provided by\nany ERISA plans.\"  For good reason, the Appellants do not provide\na  page cite or contextual  explanation.  The  quoted sentence is\nindeed in the case, but in the section summarizing the holding of\nthe  district court,  not  in our  own  holding.   Moreover,  the\nCombined  Management  decision   simply  does  not  support   the\r                              \nAppellants' arguments.  Although  we found in that case  that the\nMaine  state  law in  question was  not  preempted by  ERISA, our\ndecision  rested  on  the fact  that  the  type of  state  law in\nquestion,  a workers'  compensation  law, was  expressly excepted\r                                                                           \nfrom ERISA's preemption clause under ERISA's own terms.  Combined\r                                                                           \nManagement, 22  F.3d at 3-4 (citing ERISA    4(b)(3), 29 U.S.C.  \r                    \n1003(b)(3)).   Here,  by  contrast,  the  Decree  is  not  a  law\nexpressly excepted from ERISA's preemptive sweep.\n\n    Appellants also offer  Vartanian v. Monsanto Co., 14 F.3d 697\r                                                              \n(1st Cir.  1994), and contend  that the case  sets forth  a \"two-\npronged test\" for determining  whether a state law relates  to an\nERISA plan, which is not  met here.  Once again,  the Appellants'\nuse of case law is misguided.  Vartanian involved a plaintiff who\r                                                  \nbrought  claims against his employer under both an ERISA cause of\naction and a  cause of action  for common law  misrepresentation.\nVartanian, 14 F.3d at 699.   We found there that the state common\r                   \nlaw  cause of action was  preempted by ERISA  because the court's\ninquiry was necessarily directed  to the ERISA plan.   The \"test\"\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\n          Although  the  Decree  is   indeed  a  law  of  general\n\napplication affecting employers regardless of their participation\n\nin plans, this does not necessarily save it  from preemption.  As\n\nwe explained, laws  of general application  will be preempted  if\n\nthey \"relate to\" an ERISA-covered plan, even indirectly.  Greater\r                                                                           \n\nWashington Bd. of Trade,    U.S.   , 113 S. Ct. at 583 (citations\r                                 \n\nomitted).   In the  case  at bar,  the  Decree requires  that  an\n\nemployer pay an employee the accrued vacation pay at the time the\n\nemployee  takes leave.   Any  contract allowing  the employee  to\n\nreceive payment in  lieu of leave  is null and  void.  Under  the\n\nDecree, the employee  must work at least  one hundred hours in  a\n\nmonth to accrue one and five-twelfths vacation days.  Presumably,\n\nthe employer may establish  the employee's vacation schedule, and\n\nwhen the employee will receive the payment.\n\n          In many respects,  therefore, the Decree's requirements\n\ndiffer from  or conflict with the  terms of the Plan.   Under the\n\nDecree, the employer determines  when the employee takes vacation\n\nleave or payment; under  the Plan, the choice is  the employee's,\n\nand  the employer is not involved in the disbursement of vacation\n                    \r                              \n\nrelied upon was  formulated by  the Supreme  Court in  Ingersoll-\r                                                                           \nRand, for determining when a \"judicially created cause of action\"\r              \nis  preempted.   Ingersoll-Rand, 498  U.S.  at 141.  The analysis\r                                         \napplied  in  Vartanian is  not  the  sole,  talismanic  test  for\r                                \npreemption  in  all circumstances,  but  one  tailored for  cases\ninvolving  common  law  causes  of  action,  a  circumstance  not\npresently before us.  As we have already explained, this Circuit,\nfollowing Supreme  Court precedent, has held  that ERISA preempts\nstate laws if they relate to an ERISA plan, even indirectly.  The\ninquiry into whether  a law  \"relates to\" a  plan is  necessarily\nfact-intensive.   Here, the Decree  by its terms  interferes with\nthe administration,  accrual and disbursement  of benefits  under\nERISA plans, and is therefore preempted.      \n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nbenefits.  Under the Plan, an employee accrues vacation  benefits\n\nafter  working  at least  seventy-five  days  in a  fifteen-month\n\nperiod, whereas the Decree  establishes a different timeframe for\n\ntriggering  leave.   Most  significantly,  the  Decree imposes  a\n\npenalty on non-complying employers, and prohibits any alternative\n\narrangements.\n\n          In  all these  respects, the  Decree  imposes different\n\nrequirements on  employers than  those imposed by  the Plan,  and\n\naffects  the accrual  and  disbursement of  vacation benefits  to\n\nemployee members of the Plan.    Moreover, the manner and  degree\n\nto which the Decree  affects the Plan is substantial,  and cannot\n\nbe  termed \"tenuous, remote, or peripheral.\"   Indeed, the Decree\n\nby its terms  would prohibit  a significant aspect  of the  Plan,\n\nwhich  allows employees to  receive vacation payments  in lieu of\n\nleave.  Therefore, we  find that the Decree does  \"relate to\" the\n\nPlan for purposes of   514(a) of ERISA.\n\n            2.  Appellants' remaining contentions\r                      2.  Appellants' remaining contentions\n\n          Appellants also contend that the Decree does not create\n\na \"plan\" such as ERISA is meant to regulate.   Because the Decree\n\nis only concerned with \"vacation leave\" and not with the field of\n\n\"vacation  plans,\" they claim, the Decree is not preempted.  Once\n\nagain,  this argument seems to  rest on the Appellants' misguided\n\nperception  of  the  applicable  preemption  principles.    ERISA\n\npreempts state laws  that relate  to covered plans;  it does  not\r                                              \n\nrequire  that a  state law  establish such  a plan,  or expressly\n\ncontemplate existing plans, in order for preemption to apply.  As\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nwe have explained above,  the Plan here  is a covered plan  under\n\nthe  terms of  ERISA, and  the Decree  significantly affects  its\n\nadministration  and  restricts  its  terms.   It  is,  therefore,\n\npreempted by ERISA insofar as it affects ERISA-covered plans.\n\n          Appellants  finally   argue  that  if   the  Decree  is\n\npreempted, employees would be left without a remedy in law.  They\n\nclaim that Crowley seeks here to \"'don the mantle  of  ERISA'\" to\n\nescape  its obligation  to comply  with Puerto  Rico's employment\n\npractices law (quoting Combined Management, 22 F.3d at 5).\r                                                    \n\n          Although we are sympathetic to the Appellants' argument\n\non this point, it  unfortunately is unavailing.  As  we explained\n\nabove, one  of the primary  purposes of ERISA's  broad preemption\n\nclause was to prevent states from imposing divergent obligations,\n\nand to thereby allow employers to create  and administer employee\n\nbenefit  plans subject to one uniform set of regulations.  Simas,\r                                                                          \n\n6 F.3d  at 852.  The  additional burdens and penalties  placed on\n\nemployers  by  these   divergent,  preempted   state  laws   are,\n\ntherefore,  the necessary casualties  of the otherwise beneficial\n\neffects of ERISA.  Unlike some other federal laws, ERISA does not\n\nmerely establish a  \"floor\" of employee benefits  or rights below\n\nwhich states cannot  fall.   It sweepingly preempts  any and  all\n\nstate  laws that \"relate to\" a plan within ERISA's coverage, even\n\nthose laws which provide stronger protections for employees.  The\n\ndouble penalty mandated by  the Decree here is a  perfect example\n\nof  the type  of problem  at which  ERISA's preemption  clause is\n\ndirected.  The preemption clause of ERISA would be meaningless if\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nemployers such as Crowley could enter, by a collective bargaining\n\nagreement, into a multiemployer vacation benefit plan, and comply\n\nwith that plan, yet still be held liable under the Decree because\n\nthe plan terms differ from the Decree.\n\n          Finally, we point out that  if the Appellants had  been\n\nimproperly denied  benefits, which  is not  the  case here,  they\n\nwould  have a cause of  action under ERISA.   Therefore, although\n\nthey lose their legal remedy under the Decree through preemption,\n\nthey  gain the protections of ERISA by participating in an ERISA-\n\ncovered plan.\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\n\n          For the foregoing reasons,  we find that ERISA preempts\n\nMandatory Decree  No. 38 insofar  as it relates  to ERISA-covered\n\nemployee benefit plans.   The district court's order is therefore\n\naffirmed.\r                  \n\n                               -17-\r\r\n",

Secs. 1001 et seq., as amended (\"ERISA\").  Appellants Obdulio Rosario-Cordero and Otilio Martinez-Arroyo (\"Appellants\") initiated this action in Puerto Rico local court against their former employer, Crowley Towing and Transportation Company (\"Crowley\"), alleging that they were not allowed to enjoy vacation leave duly owed them pursuant to Mandatory Decree No. 38.  The case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico on Crowley's theory that Appellants' claims under Mandatory Decree No. 38 were preempted by ERISA.  Rosario-Cordero v. Crowley Towing &amp; Transp. Co., 850 F.Supp. 98 (D.P.R.1994).  Ruling on Crowley's motion for summary judgment, the district court held that the Appellants' claims were indeed preempted by ERISA.  Id. at 102.   For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowley operates a tugboat operation covering Puerto Rico, ports in the continental United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and some international ports.  The nature of Crowley's operations requires its employees to travel to the different ports to provide tug services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of Crowley's employees are members of the Seafarers' International Union, Atlantic, Gulf, Lakes and Inland Waters District, AFL-CIO (the \"Union\").  During all relevant periods, Appellants were members of the Union, and the Union was their exclusive bargaining representative.  Pursuant to a Collective Bargaining Agreement (the \"CBA\"), the Union and Crowley agreed to participate in the Seafarers' Vacation Plan (the \"Plan\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plan is a multiemployer employee benefit plan which provides vacation benefits to the employees of its members.  The Plan is structured and governed in accordance with ERISA.  It is administered by an Administrator.  The Administrator, in turn, is appointed by the Plan's twelve-member Board of Trustees.  Six of the Trustees are appointed by the Union and the other six by the participating employers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plan provides for the establishment of a fund from contributions from the participating employers.  The contributions are deposited in the Plan's bank accounts.  These funds, which contain only Plan monies, are held in trust, and a portion of the assets are invested in bonds and notes.  The funds are used to pay vacation benefits to the eligible participants, and to cover the Plan's administrative costs.  Under the CBA, Crowley was required to make periodic contributions to the Plan for each employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plan triggers vacation pay when an employee has worked seventy-five days in a fifteen-month period, irrespective of whether the employee intends to actually take the vacation leave.  During their employment, both Appellants applied for and received the vacation payment due them under the Plan's terms, although they did not take the vacation leave.  Appellants are now retired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite their receipt of vacation pay under the Plan, Appellants filed suit against Crowley, claiming that they were never allowed to take their vacation leave as mandated by Puerto Rico's Mandatory Decree No. 38, (the \"Decree\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The Decree provides in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Every employee shall be entitled to vacation leave with full pay to become effective when he begins to enjoy it, at the rate of one and five twelves [sic] (1 5/12) days for each month in which he has worked at least one hundred (100) hours.  This leave is equivalent to seventeen (17) workdays per year....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>The employer who does not grant any of his employees the vacation leave to which he is entitled after having accrued it for two (2) years, shall grant him the total thus far accrued, paying him twice (2) the wage corresponding to the period accrued in excess of said two years....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>Any contract whereby the employee waives, for money or other consideration, his right to actually take his vacation leave shall be unlawful and void.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants claim, therefore, that Crowley is obligated to pay them a sum equivalent to seventeen days of work per year of service, plus the double penalty provided by the Decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court granted summary judgment in Crowley's favor, we review that decision de novo.  Serrano-Perez v. FMC Corp., 985 F.2d 625, 626 (1st Cir.1993);  Pagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d 343, 347 (1st Cir.1993).  We must determine whether the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving Appellants and with all reasonable inferences drawn in their favor, presents no genuine issue of material fact and thus entitles Crowley to judgment as a matter of law.  Serrano-Perez, 985 F.2d at 626.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Preemption Under ERISA Generally</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Appellants correctly point out, preemption of state law is generally disfavored.  McCoy v. Massachusetts Inst. of Technology, 950 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1991).  This presumption against preemption is, however, not absolute.  When Congress has expressly so provided, federal preemption of state law is mandated under the Supremacy Clause.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ERISA preemption is, as a general matter, expansive in scope.  McCoy, 950 F.2d at 16.   In formulating the statute, Congress included a sweeping preemption clause, Sec. 514(a), commanding that ERISA \"shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.\"  29 U.S.C. Sec. 1144(a) (emphasis added).  For preemption purposes, \"State laws\" are \"all laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having the effect of law.\"  29 U.S.C. Sec. 1144(c)(1).  Puerto Rico is expressly included in the statute's definition of \"State.\"  29 U.S.C. Sec. 1002(10).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly explained that a state law \"relates to\" an employee benefit plan \" 'if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.' \"  District of Columbia v. Greater Washington Bd. of Trade, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 580, 583, 121 L.Ed.2d 513 (1992) (quoting Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 96-97, 103 S.Ct. 2890, 2899-2900, 77 L.Ed.2d 490 (1983));  Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U.S. 133, 139, 111 S.Ct. 478, 482-83, 112 L.Ed.2d 474 (1990).  Moreover, a state law may \"relate to\" an employee benefit plan and thereby be preempted, even if the law is not specifically designed to affect such plans, and even if its effect is indirect.  Greater Washington Bd. of Trade, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 583 (citing Ingersoll-Rand, 498 U.S. at 139, 111 S.Ct. at 482-83).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the Supreme Court's lead, this Circuit has also construed the words \"relate to\" broadly;  a state law may relate to an employee benefit plan even though the law does not conflict with ERISA's own requirements, and represents an otherwise legitimate state effort to impose or broaden benefits for employees.  Simas v. Quaker Fabric Corp. of Fall River, 6 F.3d 849, 852 (1st Cir.1993) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, a state law with even an indirect effect on an ERISA-covered benefit plan is preempted, even though ERISA by its terms may not necessarily address the topic covered by the state law.  For example, a state law is preempted if it restricts the choices of a benefit plan regarding its administration, structure, or benefits.  See, e.g., FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U.S. 52, 60, 111 S.Ct. 403, 408-09, 112 L.Ed.2d 356 (1990) (ERISA preempts Pennsylvania antisubrogation statute restricting structure of ERISA plans);  Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 451 U.S. 504, 505, 101 S.Ct. 1895, 1897, 68 L.Ed.2d 402 (1981) (ERISA preempts New Jersey statute insofar as statute prevents ERISA plans from decreasing benefits);  United Wire, Etc. v. Morristown Mem.  Hosp., 995 F.2d 1179, 1193 (3d Cir.1993) (state statute may be preempted if its effect is to \"dictate or restrict the choices of ERISA plans with regard to their benefits, structure, [or] reporting and administration\");  National Elevator Industry, Inc. v. Calhoon, 957 F.2d 1555, 1561 (10th Cir.)  (ERISA preempts Oklahoma statute insofar as it \"may be used to effect change in the administration, structure, and benefits of an ERISA plan\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 406, 121 L.Ed.2d 331 (1992);  Arkansas Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield v. St. Mary's Hospital, 947 F.2d 1341 (8th Cir.1991) (ERISA preempts Arkansas statute regulating the assignment of benefits to health care providers), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2305, 119 L.Ed.2d 227 (1992).  Any such state laws can avoid ERISA preemption only if they have merely a \" 'tenuous, remote, or peripheral connection' \" with a covered benefit plan, \" 'as is the case with many laws of general applicability.' \"  Combined Mgt. v. Superintendent of Bur. of Ins., 22 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting Greater Washington Bd. of Trade, --- U.S. at ----, n. 1, 113 S.Ct. at 583 n. 1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This broad preemptive effect of ERISA may be surprising, given that ERISA was passed primarily to safeguard employees from the abuse and mismanagement of funds accumulated in various types of employee benefit plans.  Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U.S. 1, 15, 107 S.Ct. 2211, 2219, 96 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987).  Yet, as we have explained, \"the reason for the broad preemption provision is clear:  By preventing states from imposing divergent obligations, ERISA allows each employer to create its own uniform plan, complying with only one set of rules (those of ERISA) and capable of applying uniformly in all jurisdictions where the employer might operate.\"  Simas, 6 F.3d at 852.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we address what plans constitute \"employee benefit plans\" for Sec. 514(a)'s purposes.  The district court ably set forth the applicable law on this point in its opinion, Crowley, 850 F.Supp. at 100-101, and we follow suit here merely for the sake of thoroughness.  Section 3(3) of ERISA defines employee benefit plans as plans that are either \"an employee welfare benefit plan,\" or \"an employee pension benefit plan,\" or both.  29 U.S.C. Sec. 1002(3).  An employee welfare benefit plan, in turn, is defined as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>[A]ny plan, fund, or program which was heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization, or by both, to the extent that such plan, fund, or program was established or is maintained for the purpose of providing for its participants or beneficiaries, (A) ... vacation benefits....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. Sec. 1002(1) (emphasis added).  ERISA does not further define \"plan, fund or program\" or \"vacation benefits.\"   The Supreme Court, however, has clearly stated that \"a multiemployer fund created to provide vacation benefits for union members who typically work for several employers during the course of a year ... undoubtedly falls within the scope of the Act.\"  Massachusetts v. Morash, 490 U.S. 107, 114, 109 S.Ct. 1668, 1672, 104 L.Ed.2d 98 (1989).  The Court distinguished such multiemployer plans, where vacation benefits are paid out of a separate fund established for that purpose, from a single employer's payroll practice of awarding vacation pay, where the payments are made out of the employer's general assets.  The latter practices, the Court held, are not covered by ERISA.  Morash, 490 U.S. at 113-14, 109 S.Ct. at 1671-73.   The Court went on to state:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>[W]e emphasize that the case before us ... concern[s] payments by a single employer out of its general assets.  An entirely different situation would be presented if a separate fund had been created by a group of employers to guarantee the payment of vacation benefits to laborers who regularly shift their jobs from one employer to another.  Employees who are a beneficiary of such a trust face far different risks and have far greater need for the reporting and disclosure requirements [of ERISA] than those whose vacation benefits come from the same fund from which they receive their paychecks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morash, 490 U.S. at 120, 109 S.Ct. at 1675-76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these principles, therefore, our task becomes clear.  We must determine 1) whether the Plan at issue in this case is an \"employee benefit plan\" within the scope of ERISA, and if so, 2) whether the Decree \"relates to\" the Plan.  If it does, then ERISA preempts the Decree and Appellants' claims under the Decree are foreclosed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Is the Plan Covered by ERISA?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we explained above, the Plan is a multiemployer employee benefit plan established and governed in accordance with ERISA.  Under the Plan, employees, including the Appellants here, become entitled to vacation benefits regardless of their employer, as long as they work seventy-five days in a fifteen-month period.  Employees seeking their vacation benefits must apply directly to the Plan Administrator to obtain them.  The benefits are then paid to employees out of a segregated trust fund established solely for that purpose, and not out of the general assets of any individual employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The employers' participation in the Plan consists solely of making the required contributions.  The individual employers, including Crowley, are not involved in the application for or the administration of the benefits.  In fact, the payment of vacation benefits under the Plan rests on contingencies and processes entirely outside of the individual employers' and employees' control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems clear to us that this Plan is precisely the type of plan that Congress intended to reach in enacting ERISA.  It certainly falls squarely within the description, quoted above, set forth by the Supreme Court in Morash, 490 U.S. at 120, 109 S.Ct. at 1675-76.   Employee members of the Plan are the beneficiaries of the trust established for the payment of their vacation benefits, and thus face the risks of fund mismanagement and payment failures that ERISA was intended to prevent.  If the Plan were not covered by ERISA, all of the Plan's participating employees would suddenly be exposed to these risks.  For these reasons, we find that the Plan at issue here is indeed an \"employee benefit plan\" for ERISA's Sec. 514(a) purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Does the Decree \"Relate to\" the Plan?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that the Decree does not \"relate to\" the Plan because 1) the Decree is a law of \"general applicability\" not aimed at the administration of ERISA plans;  2) the penalty imposed by the Decree does not constitute a \"plan\" such as ERISA is meant to regulate;  and 3) if the cause of action created by the Decree were preempted, employees would be left without a remedy at law.  We address each of these contentions in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>1. Is the Decree a \"law of general application\" with a connection \"too tenuous, remote, or peripheral\" to relate to the Plan?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants claim that the Decree is a regulation directed at all employers in the transportation industry regardless of whether they maintain an ERISA-covered plan.  The Decree, they explain, mandates and regulates vacation leave and other working conditions for the protection of workers in that industry.  As such, it is a law of general applicability neither directed at nor predicated upon the existence of an ERISA plan, and thus does not \"relate to\" the Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of their argument on this point, Appellants submit an inaccurate statement of the law.  Significantly, they incorrectly rely on the traditional preemption analysis applicable to less comprehensive federal statutes, arguing that the Decree here is not preempted because it does not interfere with ERISA's overriding concern of protecting beneficiaries of employee benefit plans from fraud or misuse of plan funds.  As we have explained, however, the broad preemption clause of ERISA obliges courts to apply ERISA's preemptive effects expansively, and therefore the preemption analysis under ERISA is entirely different than for other federal statutes.  Thus, the narrower preemption analysis offered by the Appellants is simply inapplicable here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Decree is indeed a law of general application affecting employers regardless of their participation in plans, this does not necessarily save it from preemption.  As we explained, laws of general application will be preempted if they \"relate to\" an ERISA-covered plan, even indirectly.  Greater Washington Bd. of Trade, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 583 (citations omitted).  In the case at bar, the Decree requires that an employer pay an employee the accrued vacation pay at the time the employee takes leave.  Any contract allowing the employee to receive payment in lieu of leave is null and void.  Under the Decree, the employee must work at least one hundred hours in a month to accrue one and five-twelfths vacation days.  Presumably, the employer may establish the employee's vacation schedule, and when the employee will receive the payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In many respects, therefore, the Decree's requirements differ from or conflict with the terms of the Plan.  Under the Decree, the employer determines when the employee takes vacation leave or payment;  under the Plan, the choice is the employee's, and the employer is not involved in the disbursement of vacation benefits.  Under the Plan, an employee accrues vacation benefits after working at least seventy-five days in a fifteen-month period, whereas the Decree establishes a different timeframe for triggering leave.  Most significantly, the Decree imposes a penalty on non-complying employers, and prohibits any alternative arrangements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all these respects, the Decree imposes different requirements on employers than those imposed by the Plan, and affects the accrual and disbursement of vacation benefits to employee members of the Plan.  Moreover, the manner and degree to which the Decree affects the Plan is substantial, and cannot be termed \"tenuous, remote, or peripheral.\"   Indeed, the Decree by its terms would prohibit a significant aspect of the Plan, which allows employees to receive vacation payments in lieu of leave.  Therefore, we find that the Decree does \"relate to\" the Plan for purposes of Sec. 514(a) of ERISA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Appellants' remaining contentions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also contend that the Decree does not create a \"plan\" such as ERISA is meant to regulate.  Because the Decree is only concerned with \"vacation leave\" and not with the field of \"vacation plans,\" they claim, the Decree is not preempted.  Once again, this argument seems to rest on the Appellants' misguided perception of the applicable preemption principles.  ERISA preempts state laws that relate to covered plans;  it does not require that a state law establish such a plan, or expressly contemplate existing plans, in order for preemption to apply.  As we have explained above, the Plan here is a covered plan under the terms of ERISA, and the Decree significantly affects its administration and restricts its terms.  It is, therefore, preempted by ERISA insofar as it affects ERISA-covered plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants finally argue that if the Decree is preempted, employees would be left without a remedy in law.  They claim that Crowley seeks here to \" 'don the mantle of ERISA' \" to escape its obligation to comply with Puerto Rico's employment practices law (quoting Combined Management, 22 F.3d at 5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we are sympathetic to the Appellants' argument on this point, it unfortunately is unavailing.  As we explained above, one of the primary purposes of ERISA's broad preemption clause was to prevent states from imposing divergent obligations, and to thereby allow employers to create and administer employee benefit plans subject to one uniform set of regulations.  Simas, 6 F.3d at 852.   The additional burdens and penalties placed on employers by these divergent, preempted state laws are, therefore, the necessary casualties of the otherwise beneficial effects of ERISA.  Unlike some other federal laws, ERISA does not merely establish a \"floor\" of employee benefits or rights below which states cannot fall.  It sweepingly preempts any and all state laws that \"relate to\" a plan within ERISA's coverage, even those laws which provide stronger protections for employees.  The double penalty mandated by the Decree here is a perfect example of the type of problem at which ERISA's preemption clause is directed.  The preemption clause of ERISA would be meaningless if employers such as Crowley could enter, by a collective bargaining agreement, into a multiemployer vacation benefit plan, and comply with that plan, yet still be held liable under the Decree because the plan terms differ from the Decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we point out that if the Appellants had been improperly denied benefits, which is not the case here, they would have a cause of action under ERISA.

The Board is authorized by Section 2 of the Minimum Wage Act of Puerto Rico, 29 L.P.R.A. Sec. 245a, to establish mandatory decrees regarding the working conditions of particular industries.  These decrees are quasi-legislative documents with the force of law.  Mendoza v. Minimum Wage Board of Puerto Rico, 74 P.R.R. 695, 702 (1953)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Appellants also erroneously rely on two cases to support their contentions.  First, they cite our decision in Combined Management, 22 F.3d at 1, for the proposition that a state law is not preempted by ERISA when the law is \"a matter of general application affecting all private employers, whether or not they have adopted an ERISA plan, and because the law does not affect the structure, administration, or type of benefits provided by any ERISA plans.\"   For good reason, the Appellants do not provide a page cite or contextual explanation.  The quoted sentence is indeed in the case, but in the section summarizing the holding of the district court, not in our own holding.  Moreover, the Combined Management decision simply does not support the Appellants' arguments.  Although we found in that case that the Maine state law in question was not preempted by ERISA, our decision rested on the fact that the type of state law in question, a workers' compensation law, was expressly excepted from ERISA's preemption clause under ERISA's own terms.  Combined Management, 22 F.3d at 3-4 (citing ERISA Sec. 4(b)(3), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1003(b)(3)).  Here, by contrast, the Decree is not a law expressly excepted from ERISA's preemptive sweep</p>\n        <p>Appellants also offer Vartanian v. Monsanto Co., 14 F.3d 697 (1st Cir.1994), and contend that the case sets forth a \"two-pronged test\" for determining whether a state law relates to an ERISA plan, which is not met here.  Once again, the Appellants' use of case law is misguided.  Vartanian involved a plaintiff who brought claims against his employer under both an ERISA cause of action and a cause of action for common law misrepresentation.  Vartanian, 14 F.3d at 699.   We found there that the state common law cause of action was preempted by ERISA because the court's inquiry was necessarily directed to the ERISA plan.  The \"test\" relied upon was formulated by the Supreme Court in Ingersoll-Rand, for determining when a \"judicially created cause of action\" is preempted.  Ingersoll-Rand, 498 U.S. at 141, 111 S.Ct. at 484.   The analysis applied in Vartanian is not the sole, talismanic test for preemption in all circumstances, but one tailored for cases involving common law causes of action, a circumstance not presently before us.  As we have already explained, this Circuit, following Supreme Court precedent, has held that ERISA preempts state laws if they relate to an ERISA plan, even indirectly.  The inquiry into whether a law \"relates to\" a plan is necessarily fact-intensive.  Here, the Decree by its terms interferes with the administration, accrual and disbursement of benefits under ERISA plans, and is therefore preempted.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Secs. 1001 et seq., as amended (\"ERISA\").  Appellants Obdulio Rosario-Cordero and Otilio Martinez-Arroyo (\"Appellants\") initiated this action in Puerto Rico local court against their former employer, Crowley Towing and Transportation Company (\"Crowley\"), alleging that they were not allowed to enjoy vacation leave duly owed them pursuant to Mandatory Decree No. 38.  The case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico on Crowley's theory that Appellants' claims under Mandatory Decree No. 38 were preempted by ERISA.

Ruling on Crowley's motion for summary judgment, the district court held that the Appellants' claims were indeed preempted by ERISA.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 102. </span>  For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowley operates a tugboat operation covering Puerto Rico, ports in the continental United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and some international ports.  The nature of Crowley's operations requires its employees to travel to the different ports to provide tug services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of Crowley's employees are members of the Seafarers' International Union, Atlantic, Gulf, Lakes and Inland Waters District, AFL-CIO (the \"Union\").  During all relevant periods, Appellants were members of the Union, and the Union was their exclusive bargaining representative.  Pursuant to a Collective Bargaining Agreement (the \"CBA\"), the Union and Crowley agreed to participate in the Seafarers' Vacation Plan (the \"Plan\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plan is a multiemployer employee benefit plan which provides vacation benefits to the employees of its members.  The Plan is structured and governed in accordance with ERISA.  It is administered by an Administrator.  The Administrator, in turn, is appointed by the Plan's twelve-member Board of Trustees.  Six of the Trustees are appointed by the Union and the other six by the participating employers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plan provides for the establishment of a fund from contributions from the participating employers.  The contributions are deposited in the Plan's bank accounts.  These funds, which contain only Plan monies, are held in trust, and a portion of the assets are invested in bonds and notes.  The funds are used to pay vacation benefits to the eligible participants, and to cover the Plan's administrative costs.  Under the CBA, Crowley was required to make periodic contributions to the Plan for each employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plan triggers vacation pay when an employee has worked seventy-five days in a fifteen-month period, irrespective of whether the employee intends to actually take the vacation leave.  During their employment, both Appellants applied for and received the vacation payment due them under the Plan's terms, although they did not take the vacation leave.  Appellants are now retired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite their receipt of vacation pay under the Plan, Appellants filed suit against Crowley, claiming that they were never allowed to take their vacation leave as mandated by Puerto Rico's Mandatory Decree No. 38, (the \"Decree\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The Decree provides in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Every employee shall be entitled to vacation leave with full pay to become effective when he begins to enjoy it, at the rate of one and five twelves [sic] (1 5/12) days for each month in which he has worked at least one hundred (100) hours.  This leave is equivalent to seventeen (17) workdays per year....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>The employer who does not grant any of his employees the vacation leave to which he is entitled after having accrued it for two (2) years, shall grant him the total thus far accrued, paying him twice (2) the wage corresponding to the period accrued in excess of said two years....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>Any contract whereby the employee waives, for money or other consideration, his right to actually take his vacation leave shall be unlawful and void.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants claim, therefore, that Crowley is obligated to pay them a sum equivalent to seventeen days of work per year of service, plus the double penalty provided by the Decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Yet, as we have explained, \"the reason for the broad preemption provision is clear:  By preventing states from imposing divergent obligations, ERISA allows each employer to create its own uniform plan, complying with only one set of rules (those of ERISA) and capable of applying uniformly in all jurisdictions where the employer might operate.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654586\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Simas,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/654586/john-simas-v-quaker-fabric-corporation-of-fall-river-commonwealth-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">852</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we address what plans constitute \"employee benefit plans\" for Sec. 514(a)'s purposes.  The district court ably set forth the applicable law on this point in its opinion, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Crowley,</span> <span class=\"volume\">850</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">100-101</span></span>, and we follow suit here merely for the sake of thoroughness.  Section 3(3) of ERISA defines employee benefit plans as plans that are either \"an employee welfare benefit plan,\" or \"an employee pension benefit plan,\" or both.  29 U.S.C. Sec. 1002(3).  An employee welfare benefit plan, in turn, is defined as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>[A]ny plan, fund, or program which was heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization, or by both, to the extent that such plan, fund, or program was established or is maintained for the purpose of providing for its participants or beneficiaries, (A) ... vacation benefits....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. Sec. 1002(1) (emphasis added).  ERISA does not further define \"plan, fund or program\" or \"vacation benefits.\"   The Supreme Court, however, has clearly stated that \"a multiemployer fund created to provide vacation benefits for union members who typically work for several employers during the course of a year ... undoubtedly falls within the scope of the Act.\"  Massachusetts v. Morash, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112246\"><a href=\"/opinion/112246/massachusetts-v-morash/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 114, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112246\"><a href=\"/opinion/112246/massachusetts-v-morash/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span> </a></span>(1989).  The Court distinguished such multiemployer plans, where vacation benefits are paid out of a separate fund established for that purpose, from a single employer's payroll practice of awarding vacation pay, where the payments are made out of the employer's general assets.  The latter practices, the Court held, are not covered by ERISA.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112246\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Morash,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112246/massachusetts-v-morash/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">113-14</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. at 1671-73.   The Court went on to state:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>[W]e emphasize that the case before us ... concern[s] payments by a single employer out of its general assets.  An entirely different situation would be presented if a separate fund had been created by a group of employers to guarantee the payment of vacation benefits to laborers who regularly shift their jobs from one employer to another.  Employees who are a beneficiary of such a trust face far different risks and have far greater need for the reporting and disclosure requirements [of ERISA] than those whose vacation benefits come from the same fund from which they receive their paychecks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112246\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Morash,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112246/massachusetts-v-morash/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. at 1675-76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these principles, therefore, our task becomes clear.  We must determine 1) whether the Plan at issue in this case is an \"employee benefit plan\" within the scope of ERISA, and if so, 2) whether the Decree \"relates to\" the Plan.  If it does, then ERISA preempts the Decree and Appellants' claims under the Decree are foreclosed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Is the Plan Covered by ERISA?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we explained above, the Plan is a multiemployer employee benefit plan established and governed in accordance with ERISA.  Under the Plan, employees, including the Appellants here, become entitled to vacation benefits regardless of their employer, as long as they work seventy-five days in a fifteen-month period.  Employees seeking their vacation benefits must apply directly to the Plan Administrator to obtain them.  The benefits are then paid to employees out of a segregated trust fund established solely for that purpose, and not out of the general assets of any individual employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The employers' participation in the Plan consists solely of making the required contributions.  The individual employers, including Crowley, are not involved in the application for or the administration of the benefits.  In fact, the payment of vacation benefits under the Plan rests on contingencies and processes entirely outside of the individual employers' and employees' control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems clear to us that this Plan is precisely the type of plan that Congress intended to reach in enacting ERISA.  It certainly falls squarely within the description, quoted above, set forth by the Supreme Court in <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112246\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Morash,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112246/massachusetts-v-morash/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. at 1675-76.   Employee members of the Plan are the beneficiaries of the trust established for the payment of their vacation benefits, and thus face the risks of fund mismanagement and payment failures that ERISA was intended to prevent.  If the Plan were not covered by ERISA, all of the Plan's participating employees would suddenly be exposed to these risks.  For these reasons, we find that the Plan at issue here is indeed an \"employee benefit plan\" for ERISA's Sec. 514(a) purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Does the Decree \"Relate to\" the Plan?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that the Decree does not \"relate to\" the Plan because 1) the Decree is a law of \"general applicability\" not aimed at the administration of ERISA plans;  2) the penalty imposed by the Decree does not constitute a \"plan\" such as ERISA is meant to regulate;  and 3) if the cause of action created by the Decree were preempted, employees would be left without a remedy at law.  We address each of these contentions in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>1. Is the Decree a \"law of general application\" with a connection \"too tenuous, remote, or peripheral\" to relate to the Plan?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants claim that the Decree is a regulation directed at all employers in the transportation industry regardless of whether they maintain an ERISA-covered plan.  The Decree, they explain, mandates and regulates vacation leave and other working conditions for the protection of workers in that industry.  As such, it is a law of general applicability neither directed at nor predicated upon the existence of an ERISA plan, and thus does not \"relate to\" the Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of their argument on this point, Appellants submit an inaccurate statement of the law.  Significantly, they incorrectly rely on the traditional preemption analysis applicable to less comprehensive federal statutes, arguing that the Decree here is not preempted because it does not interfere with ERISA's overriding concern of protecting beneficiaries of employee benefit plans from fraud or misuse of plan funds.  As we have explained, however, the broad preemption clause of ERISA obliges courts to apply ERISA's preemptive effects expansively, and therefore the preemption analysis under ERISA is entirely different than for other federal statutes.  Thus, the narrower preemption analysis offered by the Appellants is simply inapplicable here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Decree is indeed a law of general application affecting employers regardless of their participation in plans, this does not necessarily save it from preemption.  As we explained, laws of general application will be preempted if they \"relate to\" an ERISA-covered plan, even indirectly.  Greater Washington Bd. of Trade, --- U.S. at <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112799\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">----,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112799/district-of-columbia-v-greater-washington-bd-of-trade/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> at <span class=\"page\">583</span> </a></span>(citations omitted).  In the case at bar, the Decree requires that an employer pay an employee the accrued vacation pay at the time the employee takes leave.  Any contract allowing the employee to receive payment in lieu of leave is null and void.  Under the Decree, the employee must work at least one hundred hours in a month to accrue one and five-twelfths vacation days.  Presumably, the employer may establish the employee's vacation schedule, and when the employee will receive the payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In many respects, therefore, the Decree's requirements differ from or conflict with the terms of the Plan.  Under the Decree, the employer determines when the employee takes vacation leave or payment;  under the Plan, the choice is the employee's, and the employer is not involved in the disbursement of vacation benefits.  Under the Plan, an employee accrues vacation benefits after working at least seventy-five days in a fifteen-month period, whereas the Decree establishes a different timeframe for triggering leave.  Most significantly, the Decree imposes a penalty on non-complying employers, and prohibits any alternative arrangements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all these respects, the Decree imposes different requirements on employers than those imposed by the Plan, and affects the accrual and disbursement of vacation benefits to employee members of the Plan.  Moreover, the manner and degree to which the Decree affects the Plan is substantial, and cannot be termed \"tenuous, remote, or peripheral.\"   Indeed, the Decree by its terms would prohibit a significant aspect of the Plan, which allows employees to receive vacation payments in lieu of leave.  Therefore, we find that the Decree does \"relate to\" the Plan for purposes of Sec. 514(a) of ERISA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Appellants' remaining contentions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also contend that the Decree does not create a \"plan\" such as ERISA is meant to regulate.  Because the Decree is only concerned with \"vacation leave\" and not with the field of \"vacation plans,\" they claim, the Decree is not preempted.  Once again, this argument seems to rest on the Appellants' misguided perception of the applicable preemption principles.  ERISA preempts state laws that relate to covered plans;  it does not require that a state law establish such a plan, or expressly contemplate existing plans, in order for preemption to apply.  As we have explained above, the Plan here is a covered plan under the terms of ERISA, and the Decree significantly affects its administration and restricts its terms.  It is, therefore, preempted by ERISA insofar as it affects ERISA-covered plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants finally argue that if the Decree is preempted, employees would be left without a remedy in law.  They claim that Crowley seeks here to \" 'don the mantle of ERISA' \" to escape its obligation to comply with Puerto Rico's employment practices law (quoting Combined <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668249\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Management,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/668249/combined-management-inc-v-superintendent-of-the-bureau-of-insurance-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we are sympathetic to the Appellants' argument on this point, it unfortunately is unavailing.  As we explained above, one of the primary purposes of ERISA's broad preemption clause was to prevent states from imposing divergent obligations, and to thereby allow employers to create and administer employee benefit plans subject to one uniform set of regulations.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654586\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Simas,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/654586/john-simas-v-quaker-fabric-corporation-of-fall-river-commonwealth-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">852</span></a></span>.   The additional burdens and penalties placed on employers by these divergent, preempted state laws are, therefore, the necessary casualties of the otherwise beneficial effects of ERISA.  Unlike some other federal laws, ERISA does not merely establish a \"floor\" of employee benefits or rights below which states cannot fall.  It sweepingly preempts any and all state laws that \"relate to\" a plan within ERISA's coverage, even those laws which provide stronger protections for employees.  The double penalty mandated by the Decree here is a perfect example of the type of problem at which ERISA's preemption clause is directed.  The preemption clause of ERISA would be meaningless if employers such as Crowley could enter, by a collective bargaining agreement, into a multiemployer vacation benefit plan, and comply with that plan, yet still be held liable under the Decree because the plan terms differ from the Decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we point out that if the Appellants had been improperly denied benefits, which is not the case here, they would have a cause of action under ERISA.  Therefore, although they lose their legal remedy under the Decree through preemption, they gain the protections of ERISA by participating in an ERISA-covered plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that ERISA preempts Mandatory Decree No. 38 insofar as it relates to ERISA-covered employee benefit plans.  The district court's order is therefore affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Decree is one of 43 decrees promulgated by the Minimum Wage Board of Puerto Rico.  The Board is authorized by Section 2 of the Minimum Wage Act of Puerto Rico, 29 L.P.R.A. Sec. 245a, to establish mandatory decrees regarding the working conditions of particular industries.  These decrees are quasi-legislative documents with the force of law.  Mendoza v. Minimum Wage Board of Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">695</span></span>, 702 (1953)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Appellants also erroneously rely on two cases to support their contentions.  First, they cite our decision in Combined <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668249\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Management,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/668249/combined-management-inc-v-superintendent-of-the-bureau-of-insurance-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, for the proposition that a state law is not preempted by ERISA when the law is \"a matter of general application affecting all private employers, whether or not they have adopted an ERISA plan, and because the law does not affect the structure, administration, or type of benefits provided by any ERISA plans.\"   For good reason, the Appellants do not provide a page cite or contextual explanation.  The quoted sentence is indeed in the case, but in the section summarizing the holding of the district court, not in our own holding.  Moreover, the Combined Management decision simply does not support the Appellants' arguments.  Although we found in that case that the Maine state law in question was not preempted by ERISA, our decision rested on the fact that the type of state law in question, a workers' compensation law, was expressly excepted from ERISA's preemption clause under ERISA's own terms.  Combined <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668249\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Management,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/668249/combined-management-inc-v-superintendent-of-the-bureau-of-insurance-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">3-4</span> </a></span>(citing ERISA Sec. 4(b)(3), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1003(b)(3)).  Here, by contrast, the Decree is not a law expressly excepted from ERISA's preemptive sweep</p>\n        <p>Appellants also offer Vartanian v. Monsanto Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195179\"><a href=\"/opinion/195179/vartanian-v-monsanto-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1994), and contend that the case sets forth a \"two-pronged test\" for determining whether a state law relates to an ERISA plan, which is not met here.  Once again, the Appellants' use of case law is misguided.  Vartanian involved a plaintiff who brought claims against his employer under both an ERISA cause of action and a cause of action for common law misrepresentation.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195179\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Vartanian,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195179/vartanian-v-monsanto-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">699</span></a></span>.   We found there that the state common law cause of action was preempted by ERISA because the court's inquiry was necessarily directed to the ERISA plan.  The \"test\" relied upon was formulated by the Supreme Court in Ingersoll-Rand, for determining when a \"judicially created cause of action\" is preempted.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112512\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ingersoll-Rand,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112512/ingersoll-rand-co-v-mcclendon/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span>, 111 S.Ct. at 484.   The analysis applied in Vartanian is not the sole, talismanic test for preemption in all circumstances, but one tailored for cases involving common law causes of action, a circumstance not presently before us.  As we have already explained, this Circuit, following Supreme Court precedent, has held that ERISA preempts state laws if they relate to an ERISA plan, even indirectly.  The inquiry into whether a law \"relates to\" a plan is necessarily fact-intensive.  Here, the Decree by its terms interferes with the administration, accrual and disbursement of benefits under ERISA plans, and is therefore preempted.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
