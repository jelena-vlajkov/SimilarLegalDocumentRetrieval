Claimant,  Norberta Batista-Canales,\r                                 \n\nappeals from the judgment of the district court affirming the\n\ndecision of the  Secretary of Health and Human  Services that\n\nshe is not entitled to Social Security disability benefits.\n\n          Claimant  filed  an   application  for   disability\n\nbenefits on March  14, 1991, listing  as disabilities  asthma\n\nand a back condition.  She  alleged an onset date of April 1,\n\n1985;  her  insured status  expired  on  September 30,  1990.\n\nAfter a hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) determined\n\nthat claimant's impairments,  as of September  30, 1990,  did\n\nnot  prevent her from performing  her past work  as a machine\n\noperator in  the  electronics industry.    In this  job,  she\n\nassembled parts by soldering them together; she functioned in\n\na seated position and  was not required to lift  more than 10\n\npounds at a time.  She  stopped working in February 1985 when\n\nthe company closed.\n\n          Specifically,  the ALJ found that claimant suffered\n\nfrom severe degenerative disease of  the facet joints in  her\n\nspine,   chronic   lumbosacral  sprain,   allergic  rhinitis,\n\nbronchial asthma and depression.  He credited her allegations\n\nof  pain to the extent that she was precluded from performing\n\nmore  than sedentary work.   He next found  that claimant had\n\nthe residual  functional capacity to engage in  work that did\n\nnot involve (1)  prolonged walking or  standing, (2)  lifting\n\nmore  than 10 pounds, (3) frequent  bending, and (4) exposure\n\nto dust, fumes,  gases, detergents and perfumes.  The Appeals\n\nCouncil denied claimant's request for review.\r\r\n\n          On  appeal  to this  court, claimant  first asserts\n\nthat  the ALJ was not  qualified to assess  whether her prior\n\nwork was free  of the above pollutants.  She  cites to Social\n\nSecurity Ruling 85-15 which  provides, in part, that \"[w]here\n\nan individual can tolerate very little noise, dust, etc., the\n\nimpact  on the ability to work  would be considerable because\n\nvery  few job  environments are  entirely free  of irritants,\n\npollutants,  and  other  potentially   damaging  conditions.\"\n\nSocial Security  Ruling 85-15 goes on  to distinguish between\n\nthe  above  situation and  one  requiring  only avoidance  of\r                                                                     \n\nexcessive  amounts of pollutants.   In the  latter case, \"the\n\nimpact  on the broad world  of work would  be minimal because\n\nmost job environments do not involve great noise, amounts  of\n\ndust, etc.\"   Where the  level of restriction  \"falls between\n\nvery  little  and excessive,  resolution  of  the issue  will\n\ngenerally  require  consultation  of  occupational  reference\n\nmaterials or the services of a VS [vocational specialist].\"\n\n          Claimant  argues that because there was no evidence\n\nfrom  which the ALJ could  have concluded that  her past work\n\nwas compatible with the  limits placed on her by  her asthma,\n\nthe ALJ should have consulted a VS.  Although the ALJ did not\n\nspecify the level of claimant's environmental restriction, we\n\ndo  not need  to  reach this  issue.   There  is  substantial\n\nevidence  in  the  record  to  support  the  conclusion  that\n\nclaimant's asthma,  prior  to  September  30,  1990,  imposed\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nminimal restrictions  on her  abilities to function  at work.\n\nAs such,  the impact on the number of sedentary jobs would be\n\nsmall.\n\n          Before  September 1990, there is only one reference\n\nto  an  asthmatic  condition.    In  January  1990,  claimant\n\nunderwent  surgery to remove a cyst  due to chronic maxillary\n\nsinusitis.   See Exhibit  14.   The diagnoses were  bronchial\r                            \n\nasthma  and allergic rhinitis.   A chest X-ray  taken at this\n\ntime  revealed  clear  lungs  and  claimant's  prognosis  was\n\nconsidered to be good.   The rest of the  medical evidence is\n\nfrom  1991  and  1992.    Specifically,  claimant's  treating\n\nphysician,  Dr.  Juan  de  los  Santos,  did  not  mention  a\n\ndiagnosis of chronic bronchial asthma until March 1991.   See\r                                                                         \n\nExhibit 11.\n\n          There is no evidence in the 1990 reports concerning\n\nany treatment for claimant's asthma during the period of time\r                         \n\nfor which she was insured.  The diagnosis of bronchial asthma\n\nstanding  by itself  is insufficient to  establish claimant's\n\nentitlement  to  disability  benefits.     See  Tsarelka   v.\r                                                                    \n\nSecretary of  Health and  Human Services, 842  F.2d 529,  534\r                                                    \n\n(1st Cir.  1988) (per  curiam).   In  any event,  Dr. de  los\n\nSantos stated that claimant  experienced only two attacks per\n\nmonth, each  one lasting 15  to 20 minutes.   See Exhibit 11.\r                                                             \n\nFurther,   in   two   residual  functional   capacity   (RFC)\n\nassessments, completed by  non-examining physicians in  1991,\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nclaimant was rated  as having no environmental  restrictions.\n\nGiven  the  paucity  of  evidence indicating  a  more  severe\n\ncondition, the  ALJ's conclusion that  claimant's asthma  did\n\nnot   preclude  her   from  performing   her  past   work  is\n\nsufficiently supported.\n\n          Claimant's second  argument on  appeal is  that the\n\nALJ  did not engage in the correct analysis in evaluating her\n\ncomplaints of disabling pain.  Specifically, claimant asserts\n\nthat, at the  hearing, the  ALJ failed to  inquire about  the\n\nnature of the  pain, the effectiveness  of any medication  or\n\nother  treatment, and the  impact the pain  had on claimant's\n\ndaily  activities   and  functional  restrictions.    At  the\n\nhearing, claimant  was questioned by her  attorney concerning\n\nher back pain.   She testified that  she experiences stabbing\n\npain in the left side of her back and in her left leg.   As a\n\nresult  of this pain, claimant stated that she could not bend\n\nover  to  pick up  something from  the  floor and  that after\n\nsitting,  she must straighten  herself out slowly in order to\n\nbe able to stand.   She also must change  position frequently\n\nand must crawl to dress herself.  Since  the first episode of\n\nback  pain in April 1985, the pain has worsened.  Further, in\n\na disability report, claimant stated that she could not  lift\n\nor carry heavy objects, could not sit for any  length of time\n\nand must avoid bending.  She cannot perform household chores.\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n          In  his decision,  the  ALJ referred  to the  above\n\ninformation in evaluating claimant's pain.  He also relied on\n\nthe  complaints   of  pain  that  claimant   presented  to  a\n\nconsulting  neurologist on  April  30, 1991.   Therefore,  we\n\nthink that  the ALJ correctly  applied Avery v.  Secretary of\r                                                                         \n\nHealth and Human Services,  797 F.2d 19 (1st Cir. 1986).   As\r                                     \n\nfor the  severity  of  claimant's pain,  the  ALJ,  in  fact,\n\ncredited  her  allegations of  disabling pain  in determining\n\nthat  work more  arduous than  sedentary would  aggravate her\n\ncondition.  This finding is supported by the record.\n\n          As  the  ALJ pointed  out,  claimant only  received\n\ntreatment  on one  occasion prior  to the  expiration of  her\n\ninsured status.   Claimant was hospitalized from  April 11 to\n\nApril  15, 1985  due  to severe  lumbosacral  myositis.   See\r                                                                         \n\nExhibit 20.  A note dated April 12, 1985 stated that claimant\n\nwas markedly improved.   When she was discharged claimant was\n\nstable but still had  some lumbosacral discomfort.  According\n\nto Dr. de los Santos, a C-T Scan, performed two months  prior\n\nto  claimant's hospitalization,  was  within  normal  limits,\n\ndespite  a finding of degenerative joint disease in the facet\n\njoints.  The only other reference to claimant's back is an X-\n\nray  report   dated  June   30,   1990.     It  showed   mild\n\nspondyloarthritic changes  of  the L4  vertebra,  with  well-\n\npreserved   vertebral   height  and   intervertebral  spaces.\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nClaimant  did not seek any other treatment for her back until\n\nMarch 1991 when she began seeing Dr. Noreiga Sanchez.\n\n          Again,  the  lack  of  medical  evidence  for   the\n\nrelevant time period  supports the decision  of the ALJ  that\n\nclaimant could perform her past work.  Also, the two 1991 RFC\n\nassessments indicate that claimant  can frequently lift up to\n\n25 pounds and  can sit, stand  and walk for  up to six  hours\n\neach  in an eight-hour  work day.   Finally, the consultative\n\nneurology  examination  in  April  1991  showed normal  gait,\n\nposture  and muscle tone.   Claimant could pick  up pieces of\n\npaper  from  the floor  without  difficulty.    There was  no\n\natrophy and  claimant retained  full range  of motion  in all\n\nextremities.\n\n          For  the foregoing  reasons,  the  judgment of  the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\r                                      \n\n                             -7-\r\r\n",

There  is  substantial\n\nevidence  in  the  record  to  support  the  conclusion  that\n\nclaimant's asthma,  prior  to  September  30,  1990,  imposed\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nminimal restrictions  on her  abilities to function  at work.\n\nAs such,  the impact on the number of sedentary jobs would be\n\nsmall.\n\n          Before  September 1990, there is only one reference\n\nto  an  asthmatic  condition.    In  January  1990,  claimant\n\nunderwent  surgery to remove a cyst  due to chronic maxillary\n\nsinusitis.   See Exhibit  14.   The diagnoses were  bronchial\r                            \n\nasthma  and allergic rhinitis.   A chest X-ray  taken at this\n\ntime  revealed  clear  lungs  and  claimant's  prognosis  was\n\nconsidered to be good.   The rest of the  medical evidence is\n\nfrom  1991  and  1992.    Specifically,  claimant's  treating\n\nphysician,  Dr.  Juan  de  los  Santos,  did  not  mention  a\n\ndiagnosis of chronic bronchial asthma until March 1991.   See\r                                                                         \n\nExhibit 11.\n\n          There is no evidence in the 1990 reports concerning\n\nany treatment for claimant's asthma during the period of time\r                         \n\nfor which she was insured.  The diagnosis of bronchial asthma\n\nstanding  by itself  is insufficient to  establish claimant's\n\nentitlement  to  disability  benefits.     See  Tsarelka   v.\r                                                                    \n\nSecretary of  Health and  Human Services, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503428\"><a href=\"/opinion/503428/21-socsecrepser-71-unemplinsrep-cch-17963-lisa-tsarelka-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">842</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  534\r                                                    \n\n(1st Cir.  1988) (per  curiam).   In  any event,  Dr. de  los\n\nSantos stated that claimant  experienced only two attacks per\n\nmonth, each  one lasting 15  to 20 minutes.   See Exhibit 11.\r                                                             \n\nFurther,   in   two   residual  functional   capacity   (RFC)\n\nassessments, completed by  non-examining physicians in  1991,\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nclaimant was rated  as having no environmental  restrictions.\n\nGiven  the  paucity  of  evidence indicating  a  more  severe\n\ncondition, the  ALJ's conclusion that  claimant's asthma  did\n\nnot   preclude  her   from  performing   her  past   work  is\n\nsufficiently supported.\n\n          Claimant's second  argument on  appeal is  that the\n\nALJ  did not engage in the correct analysis in evaluating her\n\ncomplaints of disabling pain.  Specifically, claimant asserts\n\nthat, at the  hearing, the  ALJ failed to  inquire about  the\n\nnature of the  pain, the effectiveness  of any medication  or\n\nother  treatment, and the  impact the pain  had on claimant's\n\ndaily  activities   and  functional  restrictions.    At  the\n\nhearing, claimant  was questioned by her  attorney concerning\n\nher back pain.   She testified that  she experiences stabbing\n\npain in the left side of her back and in her left leg.   As a\n\nresult  of this pain, claimant stated that she could not bend\n\nover  to  pick up  something from  the  floor and  that after\n\nsitting,  she must straighten  herself out slowly in order to\n\nbe able to stand.   She also must change  position frequently\n\nand must crawl to dress herself.  Since  the first episode of\n\nback  pain in April 1985, the pain has worsened.  Further, in\n\na disability report, claimant stated that she could not  lift\n\nor carry heavy objects, could not sit for any  length of time\n\nand must avoid bending.  She cannot perform household chores.\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n          In  his decision,  the  ALJ referred  to the  above\n\ninformation in evaluating claimant's pain.  He also relied on\n\nthe  complaints   of  pain  that  claimant   presented  to  a\n\nconsulting  neurologist on  April  30, 1991.   Therefore,  we\n\nthink that  the ALJ correctly  applied Avery v.  Secretary of\r                                                                         \n\nHealth and Human Services,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474185\"><a href=\"/opinion/474185/14-socsecrepser-301-unemplinsrep-cch-16883-ernest-s-avery-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1st Cir. 1986).   As\r                                     \n\nfor the  severity  of  claimant's pain,  the  ALJ,  in  fact,\n\ncredited  her  allegations of  disabling pain  in determining\n\nthat  work more  arduous than  sedentary would  aggravate her\n\ncondition.  This finding is supported by the record.\n\n          As  the  ALJ pointed  out,  claimant only  received\n\ntreatment  on one  occasion prior  to the  expiration of  her\n\ninsured status.   Claimant was hospitalized from  April 11 to\n\nApril  15, 1985  due  to severe  lumbosacral  myositis.   See\r                                                                         \n\nExhibit 20.  A note dated April 12, 1985 stated that claimant\n\nwas markedly improved.   When she was discharged claimant was\n\nstable but still had  some lumbosacral discomfort.  According\n\nto Dr. de los Santos, a C-T Scan, performed two months  prior\n\nto  claimant's hospitalization,  was  within  normal  limits,\n\ndespite  a finding of degenerative joint disease in the facet\n\njoints.  The only other reference to claimant's back is an X-\n\nray  report   dated  June   30,   1990.     It  showed   mild\n\nspondyloarthritic changes  of  the L4  vertebra,  with  well-\n\npreserved   vertebral   height  and   intervertebral  spaces.\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nClaimant  did not seek any other treatment for her back until\n\nMarch 1991 when she began seeing Dr. Noreiga Sanchez.\n\n          Again,  the  lack  of  medical  evidence  for   the\n\nrelevant time period  supports the decision  of the ALJ  that\n\nclaimant could perform her past work.  Also, the two 1991 RFC\n\nassessments indicate that claimant  can frequently lift up to\n\n25 pounds and  can sit, stand  and walk for  up to six  hours\n\neach  in an eight-hour  work day.   Finally, the consultative\n\nneurology  examination  in  April  1991  showed normal  gait,\n\nposture  and muscle tone.   Claimant could pick  up pieces of\n\npaper  from  the floor  without  difficulty.    There was  no\n\natrophy and  claimant retained  full range  of motion  in all\n\nextremities.\n\n          For  the foregoing  reasons,  the  judgment of  the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\r                                      \n\n                             -7-\r\r\n</pre>",
