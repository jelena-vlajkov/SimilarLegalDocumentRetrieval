Although  the legal question  presented is\n\nopen to reasonable debate, we agree with the district court's\n\nresolution  and do  not think  that we  can improve  upon the\n\nreasoning set  forth in  its decision.   Accordingly, on  the\n\ncentral  issue  we affirm  on the  grounds  set forth  in the\n\ndecision of the district court.\n\n     The only remaining issue is  the claim that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in refusing to allow an amendment\n\nto the  complaint to  assert a new  cause of action  based on\n\nunseaworthiness.    This case  relates  to  an incident  that\n\noccurred  in December  1987; the  defense motion  for summary\n\njudgment  was filed in November 1992; and the motion to amend\n\nthe  complaint was  filed only  after  the district  court in\n                                     \n\nSeptember 1993 granted the motion  for summary judgment.  The\n\nmotion  gave no  adequate reason  to excuse  this substantial\n\ndelay in moving to amend.  Under the circumstances, we do not\n\nthink  that  the  district  court abused  its  discretion  in\n\ndenying the motion as untimely.\n\n                             -2-\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -3-\n",
