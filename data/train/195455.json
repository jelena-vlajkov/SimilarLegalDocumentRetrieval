Jose Castillo-Moronta pled  guilty under 8\n               \n\nU.S.C.     1326(b)(2) to  unlawful  reentry  into the  United\n\nStates following his  deportation.  He now  advances a single\n\nchallenge to his  sentence, arguing that  the court erred  in\n\nimposing a  16-level enhancement  to his offense  level under\n\nU.S.S.G.     2L1.2(b)(2)  on  the  ground  that  he had  been\n\ndeported after  conviction for  an \"aggravated felony.\"   His\n\nsole argument is that  the underlying offense triggering this\n\nenhancement--a  Rhode  Island  conviction  for  manufacturing\n\nmarijuana--does  not constitute  an  aggravated felony.    We\n\ndisagree and therefore summarily affirm.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\n                                             \n\n     Echoing  the   definition  contained   in  8  U.S.C.    \n\n1101(a)(43), the  commentary to    2L1.2  defines \"aggravated\n\nfelony\" to include \"any illicit trafficking in any controlled\n\nsubstance (as defined in 21 U.S.C.   802), including any drug\n\ntrafficking  crime as defined in  18 U.S.C.   924(c)(2) ....\"\n\nU.S.S.G.   2L1.2, comment. (n.7).  The commentary also states\n\nthat the term encompasses such offenses \"whether in violation\n\nof federal or state  law.\"  Id.   The term \"drug  trafficking\n                               \n\ncrime,\"  in  turn, is  defined in  18  U.S.C.    924(c)(2) to\n\ninclude   \"any  felony   punishable   under  the   Controlled\n\nSubstances  Act  (21  U.S.C.  801 et  seq.),  the  Controlled\n\nSubstances  Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951 et seq.), or\n\nthe Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C.App.  1901 et\n\nseq.).\"  Accordingly, for  a drug offense to fall  within the\n\n                             -2-\n\nscope  of     924(c)(2) and  thus  within  the definition  of\n\naggravated  felony, it  must meet  two criteria:  \"first, the\n\noffense  must   be  punishable  under  one   of  these  three\n\nenumerated  statutes;  and  second,  the offense  must  be  a\n\nfelony.\"   United States v.  Forbes, 16 F.3d  1294, 1301 (1st\n                                   \n\nCir. 1994); accord, e.g.,  Amaral v. I.N.S., 977 F.2d  33, 35\n                                           \n\n(1st Cir. 1992). \n\n     Both    of   these   criteria    are   satisfied   here.\n\nManufacturing a controlled substance, including marijuana, is\n\nspecifically proscribed by 21  U.S.C.   841(a)(1).   And such\n\nan offense constitutes a felony.   As we explained in both of\n\nthe decisions just cited, a felony is defined in  21 U.S.C.  \n\n802(13)  as  \"any  Federal  or State  offense  classified  by\n\napplicable  Federal or  State law  as a  felony.\"1   Under 18\n\nU.S.C.     3559(a), an  offense is  a  felony if  the maximum\n\nauthorized  term of imprisonment exceeds  one year.2  Both 21\n\nU.S.C.     841  and  R.I.  Gen.  Laws     21-28-4.01(A)(2)(a)\n\nprescribe a maximum prison term in excess of one year for the\n\noffense of manufacturing a controlled substance. \n\n                    \n\n1.  See also United States  v. Aymelek, 926 F.2d 64,  71 (1st\n                                      \nCir.  1991) (\"Although state  law must  still be  examined to\nascertain  the   elements  of   a   predicate  offense,   the\nconviction's   ultimate    classification,   for   guidelines\npurposes, is determined by federal law.\") (applying   2L1.2).\n\n2.  Rhode  Island law is to  the same effect.   See R.I. Gen.\n                                                   \nLaws   11-1-2.  \n\n                             -3-\n\n     Defendant  does  not  take  issue with  this  reasoning.\n\nRather,  he contends  that  a \"mechanical  application\" of   \n\n2L1.2  here  results  in  a  sentence  that  exaggerates  the\n\nseriousness  of his  offense.  He  emphasizes that,  far from\n\nbeing involved in  the manufacture  or sale of  drugs on  any\n\nlarge-scale basis,  he was found  in possession  of a  single\n\nmarijuana   plant   (along  with   a   half-smoked  marijuana\n\ncigarette) which he claims was intended for  his personal use\n\nonly.   Yet this argument has no bearing on the applicability\n\nof    2L1.2's 16-level  enhancement; rather, it  concerns the\n\npropriety  of  a possible  downward  departure.   See,  e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nUnited  States v.  Hinds, 803  F. Supp.  675 (W.D.N.Y.  1992)\n                        \n\n(departing  downward  under  analogous circumstances),  aff'd\n                                                             \n\nmem., 992 F.2d 321 (2d Cir. 1993).  Indeed, a good portion of\n    \n\nthe sentencing hearing was devoted to the question of whether\n\nsuch  a   departure  was  warranted.     The  district  court\n\nultimately  decided,   in  its  discretion,   not  to  depart\n\ndownward,   relying   on   other  factors   indicating   that\n\ndefendant's  overall conduct  was less  benign than  it might\n\nfirst appear.3   Defendant here has advanced no  challenge to\n\n                    \n\n3.  For  example,   defendant  was  convicted   in  1988   of\npossession of heroin.   In 1991, he was  convicted of using a\nfalse social  security number and making  false statements to\npurchase eleven  pistols and  a shotgun.    Defendant was  on\nsupervised  release from  the firearms  offenses when  he was\narrested on the marijuana  charge.  Among the items  found in\nhis apartment at that  time were over $28,000 in  cash hidden\nbehind  a refrigerator panel  and 27 boxes  of empty glassine\npackets, which  according to  the police  report are used  to\n\n                             -4-\n\nthis determination, and we  of course would lack jurisdiction\n\nto entertain  it had he done so.  See, e.g., United States v.\n                                                          \n\nGifford, 17 F.3d 462, 473 (1st Cir. 1994).\n       \n\n     Affirmed.\n              \n\n                    \n\npackage heroin.   And in  1993, following his  return to  the\nUnited States  (which he  explained was  for  the purpose  of\nvisiting  his three  daughters), defendant  was  arrested for\nattempting to  pass  counterfeit currency;  he thereafter  is\nsaid  to have provided police officials with a false name and\ndate  of birth in  an attempt to  obstruct the investigation.\nThese charges remained pending at the time of sentencing. \n\n                             -5-\n",

Laws Sec. 21-28-4.01(A)(2)(a) prescribe a maximum prison term in excess of one year for the offense of manufacturing a controlled substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant does not take issue with this reasoning.  Rather, he contends that a \"mechanical application\" of Sec. 2L1.2 here results in a sentence that exaggerates the seriousness of his offense.  He emphasizes that, far from being involved in the manufacture or sale of drugs on any large-scale basis, he was found in possession of a single marijuana plant (along with a half-smoked marijuana cigarette) which he claims was intended for his personal use only.  Yet this argument has no bearing on the applicability of Sec. 2L1.2's 16-level enhancement;  rather, it concerns the propriety of a possible downward departure.   See, e.g., United States v. Hinds, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2133316\"><a href=\"/opinion/2133316/united-states-v-hinds/\"><span class=\"volume\">803</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Indeed, a good portion of the sentencing hearing was devoted to the question of whether such a departure was warranted.  The district court ultimately decided, in its discretion, not to depart downward, relying on other factors indicating that defendant's overall conduct was less benign than it might first appear.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Defendant here has advanced no challenge to this determination, and we of course would lack jurisdiction to entertain it had he done so.

In 1991, he was convicted of using a false social security number and making false statements to purchase eleven pistols and a shotgun.  Defendant was on supervised release from the firearms offenses when he was arrested on the marijuana charge.  Among the items found in his apartment at that time were over $28,000 in cash hidden behind a refrigerator panel and 27 boxes of empty glassine packets, which according to the police report are used to package heroin.  And in 1993, following his return to the United States (which he explained was for the purpose of visiting his three daughters), defendant was arrested for attempting to pass counterfeit currency;  he thereafter is said to have provided police officials with a false name and date of birth in an attempt to obstruct the investigation.  These charges remained pending at the time of sentencing</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
