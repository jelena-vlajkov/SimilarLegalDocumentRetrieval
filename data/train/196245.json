The  district  court  granted\r\n\nsummary judgment for DRC, and we affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n                      FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r                                  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r                                                    \r\n\n          In  July  1985,   DRC,  an  Andover,  Massachusetts\r\n\ncompany, hired Barbour as a staff engineer.  Although Barbour\r\n\nwas performing his  job satisfactorily, his  supervisor, Earl\r\n\nZimmerman, began  to complain  to Barbour  in September  1987\r\n\nthat  Barbour's breath  smelled  of  alcohol.    Barbour  and\r\n\nZimmerman discussed Barbour's alcohol  problem, and Zimmerman\r\n\nsuggested that Barbour apply for a medical leave of absence. \r\n\n          For   employees   with    a   medically   certified\r\n\ndisability, DRC provides company-funded short-term disability\r\n\nbenefits.  The short-term disability plan provides a disabled\r\n\nemployee  with up  to 75% of  his or  her salary.   After six\r\n\nmonths elapses,  an employee who is still  disabled must then\r\n\napply for  long-term disability benefits, which  are provided\r\n\nthrough a funded insurance program.\r\n\n          DRC  employees  applying  for  short-term  benefits\r\n\nreceive two documents.  The first, a Medical Leave of Absence\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nNotice  (the \"Disability  Notice\")  describes the  employee's\r\n\nrights and responsibilities  under the  program and  requires\r\n\ncertain information and  an employee signature.1   The second\r\n\nform,  a Physician's  Certification  of Disability  form (the\r\n\n\"Certification  Form\") is to  be completed by  the employee's\r\n\nphysician  and  returned  to  DRC's  benefits  office.    The\r\n\nDisability Notice states that the employee \r\n\n          must  submit   a  completed   Physician's\r\n          Certification  of Disability  form (or  a\r\n          comparable     note     on    physician's\r\n          letterhead).   This must  be received  in\r\n          the benefits office within 10 days of the\r\n          date your leave commences  or the date of\r\n          this notice, whichever is later.\r\n\nThe  ten-day requirement also  appears in a  memorandum dated\r\n\nJuly  1, 1987,  from DRC's  benefits  administrator, Patricia\r\n\nNickles,  to department  managers.   The memorandum  provides\r\n\nthat\r\n\n          [t]he employee has 10 days from the first\r\n          day  out  to  submit  the signed  medical\r\n          leave   letter   and    written   medical\r\n          certification to the Benefits office.  If\r\n          this timeframe  is not met,  a time  card\r\n          will not be processed . . . .\r\n\n           On or around December 4, 1987, Barbour went to see\r\n\nDRC's vice president  of human resources, John  Wilkinson, to\r\n\ndiscuss  the process  of  applying for  short-term disability\r\n\nbenefits.     During  his  meeting  with  Wilkinson,  Barbour\r\n\nreceived  an undated  Disability Notice  and  a Certification\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The record  does not indicate  when and if this  form was\r\nreturned and neither party focuses on this document.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nForm.   Barbour claims that Wilkinson told him the Disability\r\n\nNotice  was undated in order to give  him more time to obtain\r\n\ncertification.   On December 7, without any apparent employer\r\n\npermission, Barbour commenced his absence from work.  On this\r\n\nsame  day,  Barbour  brought the  Certification  Form  to the\r\n\noffice  of Dr. Kenneth Prescott,  a hematologist who had been\r\n\ntreating  him for protracted  bleeding.  Dr.  Prescott was on\r\n\nvacation but his nurse informed Barbour that the doctor would\r\n\nreturn on  December 16  and would complete  the form  at that\r\n\ntime.\r\n\n          On  December 10, Nickles sent a certified letter to\r\n\nBarbour, stating  that  unless  the  Certification  Form  was\r\n\nreturned to  her office by  December 18 -- eleven  days after\r\n\nBarbour commenced his leave -- she would assume he had chosen\r\n\nvoluntarily to  terminate his  employment.   This letter  was\r\n\nnever  received by Barbour  as it was  incorrectly addressed.\r\n\nAlthough  Nickles  told  Barbour about  the  letter  during a\r\n\nDecember 15  phone conversation, Barbour  claims that Nickles\r\n\ndid not specifically tell him  that he would be terminated if\r\n\nthe certification was  not received by December  18.  Barbour\r\n\nstates that  Nickles told  him that he  would be  receiving a\r\n\nform letter but that  he should not \"get shook\" and  that DRC\r\n\n\"will work with you but keep in touch.\"\r\n\n          On December 16,  Dr. Prescott told Barbour  that he\r\n\nwas unwilling  to  sign the  Certification Form  and that  it\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nshould be taken  to a general practitioner.   Because Barbour\r\n\nwas  not under  the care  of a  general practitioner  at that\r\n\ntime, he  experienced  difficulty in  obtaining an  immediate\r\n\nappointment.    Barbour  says that  he  attempted  to contact\r\n\nWilkinson  on December  16 to  inform him  of the  delay, but\r\n\nclaims that Wilkinson failed to return his phone calls.\r\n\n          On  December 22,  Wilkinson called  Barbour to  ask\r\n\nabout the status of  the Certification Form.  After  learning\r\n\nthat Barbour had yet to set up an appointment with  a general\r\n\npractitioner, Wilkinson  suggested that Barbour  continue his\r\n\nefforts  at obtaining certification  and told him  that \"they\r\n\nwould try  to jump the  hurdles.\"  In the  meantime, however,\r\n\nNickles  and  Wilkinson  decided  to  begin  the  termination\r\n\nprocess  and on  December  22 mailed  a  certified letter  to\r\n\nBarbour  stating that his employment was being terminated for\r\n\nfailure to comply with the ten-day deadline.  This letter too\r\n\nwas mistakenly sent to the wrong address and was not received\r\n\nby Barbour until January 10, 1988.\r\n\n          On  December 30,  Barbour finally saw  Dr. Lawrence\r\n\nMcCartin, a  general practitioner.   During the  appointment,\r\n\nDr. McCartin told Barbour that he was suffering from a number\r\n\nof  alcohol-related  disabilities,   including  hypertension.\r\n\nBarbour asked  the doctor  to indicate  on the  Certification\r\n\nForm that his disability was caused by hypertension as he did\r\n\nnot  want  alcoholism  documented  in  his  personnel   file.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nBarbour  picked up  the completed  form  from Dr.  McCartin's\r\n\noffice  on December 31 and delivered it  to DRC on January 4,\r\n\n1988,  the next business  day.  The  form was  stamped by Dr.\r\n\nMcCartin and stated that Barbour was disabled  \"indefinitely\"\r\n\nbeginning December 18, 1987, due to hypertension.\r\n\n          Upon  receipt  of   the  Certification  Form,   DRC\r\n\nproceeded to review  Barbour's disability claim.   On January\r\n\n7, Nickles  called Dr. McCartin's office and learned that Dr.\r\n\nMcCartin  had  seen Barbour  only once,  on December  30, two\r\n\nweeks after Barbour s  disability allegedly began.   She also\r\n\nlearned  that Barbour had missed a follow-up appointment with\r\n\nDr. McCartin scheduled for January 7.  DRC claims that, based\r\n\non these circumstances, along with  the fact that Barbour had\r\n\nnot listed  alcoholism as the  cause of disability,  it chose\r\n\nnot to accept the form as a valid certification of disability\r\n\nand did not reinstate Barbour.  Nickles, in informing Barbour\r\n\nof DRC's decision by letter on January 7, stated:\r\n\n          Unfortunately, I  [Nickles] am  unable to\r\n          consider   your   claim   for  disability\r\n          benefits.   As  you already know,  it was\r\n          your   responsibility   to   submit  this\r\n          documentation  by   December  18,   1987.\r\n          Since we  did not receive  your paperwork\r\n          by this deadline, you  were considered to\r\n          have    voluntarily    terminated    your\r\n          employment   with   DRC   retroactive  to\r\n          December 4, 1987. \r\n\n          The  record indicates  that Barbour  was  the first\r\n\nemployee   ever  terminated   for  failure   to  submit   the\r\n\nCertification  Form within  ten days  and that  Certification\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nForms of  other  employees were  received  by DRC  after  the\r\n\ndeadline  had elapsed (between  three and twenty  days late).\r\n\nThese employees  apparently  were not  terminated  or  denied\r\n\ndisability benefits.   The  record also  suggests that  there\r\n\nwere   other   instances  in   which   employees  turned   in\r\n\ninsufficient  Certification Forms and it is not disputed that\r\n\nthese  employees were  allowed to  supplement their  original\r\n\nforms, even though the ten-day period had expired. \r\n\n          After Barbour was terminated, he  sought no medical\r\n\ntreatment  for a  period of  nine  months.   In August  1988,\r\n\nBarbour  stopped  drinking  but continued  to  suffer  from a\r\n\nnumber of  alcohol-related illnesses.  On April  5, 1991, the\r\n\nSocial  Security Administration  adjudicated Barbour  to have\r\n\nbeen  disabled since December  4, 1987, the  approximate date\r\n\nthat his absence from work commenced.\r\n\n          In  June  1992, Barbour  commenced  this  action in\r\n\nMassachusetts  state court  under section  510  of ERISA,  29\r\n\nU.S.C.   1140,  alleging that DRC terminated him  in order to\r\n\ndeprive him of disability benefits.  DRC subsequently removed\r\n\nthe case to the United States District Court for the District\r\n\nof Massachusetts.   At the close  of discovery, both  parties\r\n\nmoved for summary judgment.  The district court granted DRC's\r\n\nmotion,  and Barbour thereafter filed a motion to reconsider.\r\n\nUpon  the district court s refusal to reconsider, this appeal\r\n\nensued.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\nA.

First, Barbour\r\n\nis a  member of the  protected class under the  ERISA statute\r\n\nbecause he  had the  opportunity to attain  a right  under an\r\n\nemployee benefit plan.  Second, Barbour has provided evidence\r\n\nthat  he was  performing satisfactorily  in  his job.   DRC's\r\n\nperformance  evaluations   indicate  that  Barbour   met  the\r\n\ncharacteristics of a \"fully  qualified experienced employee.\"\r\n\nFinally,   Barbour  was   attempting  to   obtain  disability\r\n\ncertification  when  the  employment  action  was  taken  and\r\n\nbenefits, if granted,  would have been paid  from defendant's\r\n\ngeneral funds.  As the  plaintiff's burden at the prima facie\r\n\nstage  is de minimis,  these circumstances are  sufficient to\r                                \r\n\ngive  rise  to an  inference that  DRC terminated  Barbour in\r\n\norder to interfere with his disability benefits.

Thus,  whether the  plaintiff\r\n\nrelies solely on his prima facie case and evidence of pretext\r\n\nor has  additional evidence of  specific intent as  well, the\r\n\nplaintiff  must  always  adduce  evidence  sufficient  for  a\r                                   \r\n\nrational  jury to  conclude that  the  employer's action  was\r\n\nmotivated  by an  intent to  interfere  with ERISA  benefits.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nBecause  Barbour relies largely on the same evidence to prove\r\n\nboth pretext  and specific intent,  we now assess the  sum of\r\n\nthat  evidence and  explain why it  is insufficient  to carry\r\n\nBarbour's burden.\r\n\n          Barbour points to  several facts both  disputed and\r\n\nundisputed that he  claims could lead  a reasonable juror  to\r\n\ninfer that DRC's motivation was to interfere with his receipt\r\n\nof  disability  benefits.    Barbour  contends  that  he  was\r\n\ndeliberately led  into a situation  in which DRC could  use a\r\n\nnon-existent rule  to terminate  him.  As  evidence of  this,\r\n\nBarbour  points  to  Wilkinson's  provision  of  an   undated\r\n\nDisability Notice  on December  4 in order  to give  him more\r\n\ntime to  obtain certification,  Nickles's alleged failure  to\r\n\nstate  specifically that  the Certification  Form  had to  be\r\n\nreturned by  a particular date,2 and  Wilkinson's instruction\r\n\nto Barbour  on December 22  that he should continue  with his\r\n\nefforts to obtain certification despite his difficulties.  We\r\n\nfail to  see how  a rational jury  could conclude  from these\r\n\nfacts  that DRC deliberately misled Barbour into believing he\r\n\ncould  take  as  much  time   as  he  needed  to  submit  the\r\n\nCertification Form.  No reasonable employee would assume that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  DRC disputes this allegation and claims that Nickles told\r\nBarbour on two occasions that the  Certification Form was due\r\nin the benefits office by December 18.  Even Barbour concedes\r\nthat  Nickles  told him  to  return  the  form \"as  early  as\r\npossible.\"  Because  this is a  motion for summary  judgment,\r\nhowever, we will review the facts in the light most favorable\r\nto Barbour. \r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nhe or she had an unlimited time period in which to justify an\r                                      \r\n\nabsence.  Here, the Disability Notice Barbour received stated\r\n\nvery  clearly that  a certification of  disability had  to be\r\n\nprovided no later than ten days from the date of the  form or\r\n\nthe commencement  of the leave,  whichever was later.   Since\r\n\nthe Disability  Notice was  undated, Barbour had  unequivocal\r\n\nnotice that  his ten-day period  began to run on  December 7,\r\n\nwhen he  voluntarily commenced his leave.  That Wilkinson and\r\n\nNickles  told  Barbour  to  continue with  his  certification\r\n\nefforts when  it was apparent  that he could not  comply with\r\n\nthe deadline does  not in any way indicate  a deliberate plan\r\n\nto mislead;  to the contrary, it demonstrates  that they were\r\n\nstill willing to  consider his claim.   Barbour's own account\r\n\nof his conversation  with Wilkinson on December  22 indicates\r\n\nthat  Wilkinson essentially told  Barbour that DRC  would see\r\n\nwhat it could do although he made no promises.3\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  With   respect    to   our   dissenting    brother,   his\r\ncharacterization of this conversation is  but one in a series\r\nof skewed presentations of the evidence that, taken together,\r\nhe argues would  permit a rational jury to  conclude that DRC\r\nmanagers  conspired to \"induce\" Barbour to take medical leave\r\nand \"lull\" him  into believing there would be no consequences\r\nfor failing to return the medical forms  on time.  First, the\r\ndissent  suggests that DRC had approved a \"medical disability\r\nleave\" when Barbour  voluntarily began his absence  from work\r\non December 7.  Infra  at 24.  Although DRC  provided Barbour\r                                 \r\nwith the proper forms, the record contains no support for the\r\ninference  that Barbour's absence  beginning on that  day was\r\napproved or  induced  by  DRC.   Our  brother  finds  further\r\nsupport  for his    conspiracy  theory in  the  fact that  on\r\nDecember 22, Barbour  was \"told [by Wilkinson] to continue to\r                                                                         \r\nseek medical  certification.\"   Infra at  26.   Barbour's own\r                                                 \r\nnotes, however, state  that Wilkinson actually told  him that\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nhe should \"keep going with the Dr. certificate and they would\r                                                                         \r\ntry to jump hurdles,\" and that \"we will see if we can salvage\r                               \r\nthis  thing.\"  Wilkinson's  choice of words  belies Barbour's\r\nassertion that DRC  soft-pedaled the trouble he was  in.  The\r\nassertion  is further  belied by  Barbour's own notes  of his\r\nconversation  with  Nickles  on  December  15,  in  which  he\r\nrecorded that Nickles told him that he should not \"get shook\"\r\nby  the  form letter  she  had  sent  him, and  by  Barbour's\r\nDecember 18 message for  Nickles in which he told her that he\r\ndid not want  to terminate.   See  infra at 25.   Why  should\r                                                    \r\nBarbour \"get shook\" at all by a form letter unless he knew it\r\ncontained some kind of ominous  warning?  And, if Barbour had\r\nno idea that he was flirting with termination on December 18,\r                   \r\nwhy did he  leave a message for  Nickles stating that  he did\r\n\"not  want  to  terminate\"?   The  particular  inferences the\r\ndissent would permit  the jury to draw from  this (and other)\r\nevidence  --  that  DRC  lured  an  unwary  Barbour   into  a\r\nbureaucratic  trap  --  are  patently  unreasonable  on  this\r\nrecord.\r\n          Similarly  misleading is  the dissent's  suggestion\r\nthat    DRC's  misaddressing  of the  December  10  letter to\r\nBarbour, and,  in the dissent's underlined language, the fact\r\nthat Nickles  \"did [not]  ask for  Barbour's correct  mailing\r                                                                         \r\naddress\" when she spoke to  him on December 15, were evidence\r                   \r\nof nefarious doings.   Infra at 24 n.1, 25.   The December 10\r                                        \r\nletter was addressed to Barbour at \"P.O. Box 215, 88 Rogers.\"\r\nHe  had apparently stopped  using the postal  box; the street\r\naddress, however, was  correct.  One cannot  rationally infer\r                                                                   \r\nfrom  this that  Nickles  intended  that  Barbour  would  not\r                                              \r\nreceive the letter; the fact that Nickles  put both addresses\r                                                               \r\non the envelopes  -- with at  least a reasonable  probability\r\nthat the  postal service  would direct  the  envelope to  the\r\ncorrect address --  is mighty strong evidence  of mistake and\r\nnot deliberation.  That  Nickles failed to ask  for Barbour's\r\ncorrect mailing address,  simply in light of the  fact that a\r\nletter sent a few day earlier had not arrived yet, is of even\r\nless evidentiary value; it proves absolutely nothing. \r\n          To   cite   a  final   example  of   the  dissent's\r\nindefensible  inference-drawing,   we  are   at  a  loss   to\r\nunderstand what possible weight is added to Barbour's case by\r\nthe  statements  of  Wilkinson's   secretary  to  Barbour  on\r\nDecember 31.   Infra  at 26.   The  dissent cites  this as  a\r                                \r\n\"vicarious admission,\" but of  what?  Even assuming  that the\r\nsecretary's  statements concerned matters within the scope of\r\nher employment, what  permissible negative inference could  a\r\nrational jury  draw  from  the fact  that  DRC  \"evinced  its\r\nreadiness to receive the medical form\" even after Barbour had\r\nbeen  formally terminated?    Whatever  inferential leap  our\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\n          Barbour  also argues that the fact that the penalty\r\n\nof  termination  for  failure  to  comply  with  the  ten-day\r\n\ndeadline is  not stated in  any of DRC's written  policies is\r\n\nevidence  that  DRC  fabricated  the  \"policy\"  in  order  to\r\n\ninterfere with  his benefits.   In support of  this argument,\r\n\nBarbour directs  us to  the undisputed fact  that he  was the\r\n\nfirst employee ever terminated by  DRC for failing to  comply\r\n\nwith   the  deadline.      In   addition,  Barbour   presents\r\n\nCertification Forms of  other employees  submitted after  the\r\n\ndeadline had elapsed and there is no evidence indicating that\r\n\nthese employees were terminated or denied disability benefits\r\n\nfor their late submissions. \r\n\n          Even  viewing the facts in the light most favorable\r\n\nto Barbour,  we agree  with the district  court that  at most\r\n\nthese facts show  that DRC may  have acted inconsistently  in\r\n\nits  application of the policy regarding employees who turned\r\n\nin their Certification  Forms late.  Such  evidence, standing\r\n\nalone,  is  insufficient  to  demonstrate  intent  unless the\r\n\ninconsistent application  is  linked  with  a  motivation  to\r\n\ndeprive  the  employee  of  benefits.   See,  e.g.,  Fong  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nbrother is making here escapes us.\r\n          Contrary to  the dissent's characterization  of our\r\nholding, we do not mean to imply that the total assemblage of\r\nevidence compels  a particular  conclusion;  rather, we  hold\r                            \r\nthat the conclusion  that Barbour would have a  rational jury\r                                                                    \r\ndraw  -- namely, that DRC set Barbour up to apply for medical\r\nleave so that it could fire him, and then lied about it -- is\r\nimpermissible based on this evidence. \r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nAmerican Airlines, Inc.,  626 F.2d 759, 762 (9th  Cir. 1980);\r                                   \r\n\nTeumer  v.

The\r\n\nDisability  Notice  clearly  states  that  an  employee  must\r                                                                         \r\n\nprovide medical certification  within ten days; as  we stated\r\n\nabove, no reasonable employee would assume that he or she had\r\n\nan  unlimited time  in  which  to provide  it.   The  summary\r\n\njudgment   record  indicates  that   DRC's  decision  not  to\r\n\nterminate other employees  who submitted Certification  Forms\r\n\nlate were based on extenuating circumstances absent from this\r\n\ncase.  For example, DRC  had previously extended the deadline\r\n\nwhen an  employee's physician  contacted DRC  and advised  it\r\n\nthat he or  she would be unable  to complete the form  within\r\n\nthe specified time  period.  Similarly, extensions  were also\r\n\ngranted  where an  employee was  hospitalized  and unable  to\r\n\ncomplete the form in a timely manner.\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\n          In   this  case,  DRC  was  never  contacted  by  a\r\n\nphysician regarding Barbour's  illness, and  Barbour was  not\r\n\nhospitalized.  Having received the Disability  Notice clearly\r\n\nnotifying him of the ten-day deadline, Barbour then failed to\r\n\nobtain an  appointment with a  physician willing to  sign the\r\n\nform  until December  30.   While  the delay  in obtaining  a\r\n\ndoctor's signature may not have  been entirely his fault,  it\r\n\nwas Barbour's  choice to  begin his  absence  on December  7,\r                         \r\n\nwithout any assurance  that he would obtain  certification of\r\n\ndisability  within ten  days.   By December  22, DRC  had not\r\n\nreceived  any certification  of  disability and  Barbour  had\r\n\ninformed  Wilkinson that  no future doctor's  appointment had\r\n\nbeen arranged.   It was this circumstance that  caused DRC to\r\n\nmail  the December  22  termination letter  to  Barbour.   An\r\n\nemployer  need not remain idle indefinitely while an employee\r\n\nis absent without  excuse.  While DRC may have  chosen not to\r\n\ndischarge  other  employees  for  missing  the  certification\r\n\ndeadline, Barbour's case does not present similar extenuating\r\n\ncircumstances  and,  therefore,  specific  intent  cannot  be\r\n\ninferred  from DRC's  actions.   Cf. Stratus,  40 F.3d  at 17\r                                                        \r\n\n(Title VII  plaintiff alleging disparate treatment  must show\r\n\nthat he or she was treated differently from persons similarly\r\n\nsituated in all relevant aspects).\r\n\n          In addition, DRC's actions when Barbour finally did\r\n\nsubmit  certification   make  Barbour's  claim   of  unlawful\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nmotivation even more implausible.   Despite Barbour's failure\r\n\nto  comply  with  express  company policy,  DRC  nevertheless\r\n\nreviewed Barbour's disability  claim on January 7.   Although\r\n\nthe form  was submitted over  two weeks late,  Nickles called\r\n\nDr.  McCartin to  inquire  about  the  listed  disability  of\r\n\n\"hypertension.\"     Based  on   what  she  learned   in  that\r\n\nconversation,  DRC chose not  to accept  Barbour's form  as a\r\n\nvalid   certification  of  disability.4    Even  if  DRC  was\r\n\nmistaken in its  evaluation of Barbour's disability,  as long\r\n\nas that determination was in  good faith and formed the basis\r\n\nof the decision it is permissible under section 510.  Zappia,\r                                                                        \r\n\n1993 WL  437676 at  *3.  Barbour  has failed  to produce  any\r\n\nevidence of bad faith.\r\n\n          Barbour  next argues  that specific  intent can  be\r\n\ninferred from  the mere  fact that  DRC  knew he  was in  the\r\n\nprocess of applying for benefits at the  time of termination.\r\n\nIt is undisputed that Barbour informed Wilkinson on or around\r\n\nDecember  4 that he  was considering applying  for disability\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  In fact, DRC set forth five justifications for its\r\ndecision to deny Barbour's disability claim: (1) Dr. McCartin\r\ndid not see Barbour until December 30, two weeks after the\r\ndisability allegedly began; (2) the condition listed on the\r\nform, \"hypertension,\" was different than the alcohol problem\r\nor bleeding condition which was expected given Barbour's\r\nprevious statements to DRC supervisors; (3)  Barbour appeared\r\nto have been \"shopping around\" for a physician after Dr.\r\nPrescott refused to complete the form; (4) the length of\r\ndisability (undetermined) did not coincide with medical\r\nguidelines; and (5) Barbour failed to keep his follow-up\r\nappointment with Dr. McCartin scheduled for January 7. \r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nleave.  It  is also undisputed that during  their discussion,\r\n\nBarbour  and Wilkinson  discussed  the  odor  of  alcohol  on\r\n\nBarbour's breath and  the possibility of an  alcohol problem.\r\n\nHowever, these facts add little  to Barbour's proof:  \"[E]ven\r\n\nif [Barbour] could  establish that [DRC] knew  that [Barbour]\r\n\ndefinitely planned to apply for . . . disability benefits, he\r\n\nwould still  be  required to  offer some  evidence that  this\r\n\nknowledge  somehow  influenced\"   DRC's  employment  actions.\r\n\nCorcoran v. GAB Business Servs.,  Inc., 723 F. Supp. 966, 971\r                                                  \r\n\n(S.D.N.Y. 1989).   As was  the case in Corcoran,  Barbour has\r                                                           \r\n\nfailed to produce  any evidence suggesting that  the prospect\r\n\nof paying disability benefits influenced DRC's decisions.  To\r\n\nthe contrary,  we find  it significant that  the option  of a\r\n\nmedical   leave  of  absence  was  first  suggested  by  DRC.\r\n\nBarbour's  supervisor,  Zimmerman,   approached  Barbour  and\r\n\nsuggested that  he apply for  a medical leave to  address his\r\n\nalcohol  problem.   Prior to  their  discussion, Barbour  was\r\n\nunaware that he  would even qualify for  disability benefits.\r\n\nWe think it is highly  unlikely that DRC would have suggested\r\n\nsuch an option  if it ultimately intended  to deprive Barbour\r\n\nof benefits:   DRC had no way  of knowing that  Barbour would\r\n\nfail to submit the proper documentation.\r\n\n          Barbour finally  suggests that  a factfinder  could\r\n\ninfer unlawful intent if DRC imposed criteria on Barbour that\r\n\nwere  harsher  than  that imposed  on  other  employees whose\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nillnesses were  less likely  to lead  to permanent  long-term\r\n\ndisability.  Even if such  an inference would be permissible,\r\n\nBarbour has produced  no evidence that  his illness was  more\r\n\nlikely  to  lead  to  long-term disability.    In  fact,  the\r\n\nevidence  strongly  suggests  that  DRC  would  have  granted\r\n\nBarbour  disability  benefits  had  he submitted  appropriate\r\n\ndocumentation  of his alcohol  condition.  In  1987 and 1988,\r\n\nDRC  provided disability  benefits to  all seventy-six  other\r\n\nemployees who applied for disability benefits.   Of these, at\r\n\nleast  sixteen employees applied  for and received disability\r\n\nbenefits for conditions related to the abuse of alcohol.\r\n\n          In sum, we hold that Barbour has failed to  present\r\n\nevidence that would enable a reasonable jury to conclude that\r\n\nDRC's actions  were motivated by  a desire to  interfere with\r\n\nBarbour's benefits.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                          CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          Because Barbour  has failed  to raise  an issue  of\r\n\nfact as to  whether DRC intended to interfere  with his ERISA\r\n\nbenefits,  the   district  court  properly   granted  summary\r\n\njudgment in favor of DRC on Barbour's ERISA claim.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                               \r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\n                              Dissent follows.\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\n          CYR, Circuit  Judge (dissenting).

On that day, his supervisor, Earl Zimmerman, called\r\n\nBarbour  aside and  asked whether  he  had considered  taking\r\n\nlong-term  medical  disability   leave  (\"medical  disability\r\n\nleave\").  Upon learning that Barbour had never considered it,\r\n\nZimmerman urged him to do so:  \"It's a good deal, and I don't\r\n\nsee why you shouldn't qualify for it.  I really would like to\r\n\ncall John Wilkinson [DRC  vice-president for human resources]\r\n\n. . . and tell him you are on the way down to  see him and do\r\n\nthat.\"  \r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\n          On   Zimmerman's  advice,   Barbour  went   to  see\r\n\nWilkinson, who handed him an undated medical disability leave\r                                                \r\n\nform  to be returned  \"within 10 days of  the date your leave\r\n\ncommences or  the date of  this notice, whichever  is later.\"\r                                                                       \r\n\n(emphasis  added).   The  form itself  made  no mention  that\r\n\nfailure to file on time  could result in termination, nor did\r\n\nWilkinson ever mention  that it should be returned  by a date\r\n\ncertain.\r\n\n          On December 7,  Barbour went on medical  disability\r\n\nleave.   Three  days later,  Patricia  Nickles, the  benefits\r\n\nadministrator for DRC, mailed a certified letter warning that\r\n\nBarbour could be terminated if he did not return the enclosed\r\n\nmedical certification  form (dated  December 10) by  December\r\n\n18.   As the letter was  misaddressed, Barbour never received\r\n\nit.5  \r\n\n          There  is  no  record evidence  that  DRC  had ever\r\n\nterminated or threatened to terminate an employee for failing\r\n\nto comply with  the ten-day filing provision.   Rather, on at\r\n\nleast   ten   occasions  DRC   had   accepted  late   medical\r\n\ncertification  forms.  Moreover,  this marked the  first time\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Although DRC had  the correct street address,  the letter\r\nhad been addressed to a post office  box (as well as a street\r\naddress) which  Barbour  had relinquished  sometime after  he\r\nmoved in 1984. \r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\nthat any DRC  employee had ever been threatened  with adverse\r\n\naction before the ten-day filing period had expired.6\r\n\n          On  December 15, Barbour  called to  advise Nickles\r\n\nthat he  had been unable  to return the medical  form because\r\n\nhis  physician   had  been   on  vacation.     During   their\r\n\nconversation,  Barbour  informed  Nickles that  he  had never\r\n\nreceived a certified letter dated December 10.   In response,\r\n\nNickles simply  reassured Barbour  that a  \"form letter  [had\r\n\nbeen] sent out.  Don't get shook.  We will work with  you but\r\n\nkeep in touch.\"   She never mentioned that  failure to return\r\n\nthe  completed form  within the  next three  days could,  let\r\n\nalone would, lead to Barbour's termination.  Moreover, though\r\n\nshe knew  Barbour had never  received the December  10 letter\r                                                 \r\n\nwarning  that termination could  result unless the  form were\r\n\nreturned  by December 18,  Nickles neither mailed  nor handed\r\n\nBarbour another copy, nor did  she ask for Barbour's  correct\r                                                                         \r\n\nmailing address.  \r                           \r\n\n          On December 16,  Barbour's physician, a  specialist\r\n\nin hematology, advised him that the certification form should\r\n\nbe completed  by a  general practitioner.   Although  Barbour\r\n\nleft  telephone messages  with  John  Wilkinson's office,  so\r\n\ninforming  him, the  calls  were never  returned.   Two  days\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  On  one other  occasion,  in early  1988,  DRC warned  an\r\nemployee  nineteen days after the ten-day period had elapsed.\r                                         \r\nThus,  the record supports a  fair inference that the ten-day\r\nprovision was being applied inconsistently or  selectively at\r\nor about the time Barbour was terminated. \r\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\nlater,  on December 18    unbeknownst to Barbour the deadline\r                                                                         \r\n\nfor filing  the medical form     he left a  telephone message\r\n\nfor Nickles:   \"If you don't reach [me]  this morning, [I'll]\r\n\nget to you  this afternoon.  Having  trouble getting doctor's\r\n\nsignature.  [Don't] want to terminate.\" (emphasis added).\r                                                 \r\n\n          On December  21, after  conferring with  Wilkinson,\r                                                                        \r\n\nNickles  telephoned  to   tell  Barbour  that  he   had  been\r\n\nterminated  for  failure  to  return  the  medical  forms  by\r\n\nDecember 18.   During their  telephone conversation,  Barbour\r\n\nvolunteered his  correct mailing  address.   On December  22,\r\n\nNickles  mailed Barbour  a  notice of  voluntary  termination\r                                                                         \r\n\nbased on his  failure to return the required  medical form by\r\n\nDecember 18.   That same  day, in the belief  that Wilkinson,\r\n\nrather than  Nickles, had the  authority to act in  behalf of\r\n\nDRC, Barbour contacted  Wilkinson and was told to continue to\r                                                                         \r\n\nseek medical certification.\r                                      \r\n\n          On December 30,  Barbour was examined by  a general\r\n\npractitioner, who diagnosed  hypertension.  At 9:45  a.m. the\r\n\nfollowing day,  Barbour was  advised by  the doctor's  office\r\n\nthat  the signed medical  certification form could  be picked\r\n\nup.   Barbour  immediately  informed  Wilkinson, through  his\r                                                           \r\n\nsecretary,  that the  form had  been signed.   The  record is\r\n\nsilent as to whether  he told the  secretary that he did  not\r\n\nyet  have the form in hand.   The secretary told Barbour that\r\n\nwas \"fine\" and Barbour should \"bring [the]  form over today.\"\r                     \r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\n(emphasis  added).   Thus, as  late as  December 31,  DRC had\r\n\nevinced its readiness  to receive the medical form.   See id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nat 1094 (vicarious admissions by employee). \r\n\n          Barbour did  not pick up  the form on  December 31,\r\n\ndue to car trouble.  When  he called DRC during the afternoon\r\n\nof  December 31  to explain  the delay,  no one  answered the\r\n\ntelephone.    Due  to  the  New  Year  holiday,  the  medical\r\n\ncertification  form was not received by Barbour until January\r\n\n4, 1988, the next  business day.  He delivered it  to DRC the\r\n\nsame day.  Yet on January 7, after conferring with Wilkinson,\r                                                                        \r\n\nNickles sent a certified letter to Barbour informing him that\r\n\nhis  claim for  medical  benefits  would  not  be  considered\r                                                                         \r\n\nbecause Barbour had failed to  comply with the ten-day filing\r\n\nprovision.7   On January  10, 1988, Barbour  finally received\r\n\nthe missent termination letter dated December 22, 1987.\r\n\n          A rational  factfinder reasonably could  infer from\r\n\nthe foregoing evidence that  DRC not only induced Barbour  to\r\n\ntake  medical disability  leave  but  that  it  utilized  its\r\n\nhitherto  dormant ten-day filing  provision as a  pretext for\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  Notwithstanding its  categorical notification  to Barbour\r\nthat  the   disability  benefits  application  would  not  be\r\nconsidered, DRC now contends on appeal that it was considered\r\nand rejected on the basis  of late submission and because the\r                                                                         \r\ndisability claim  was based on  hypertension, not alcoholism.\r                                                                        \r\nShould  this  belated  representation   be  credited  by  the\r\nfactfinder, it could  buttress the inference that  failure to\r\nfile the form  within ten days  was not the  true motive  for\r                                                             \r\nterminating Barbour.   In  these circumstances, Barbour  need\r\ndemonstrate no  more at  summary judgment.   See  Woodman, 51\r                                                                     \r\nF.3d at 1094. \r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\nterminating Barbour after  it had misled and lulled  him into\r\n\nbelieving that the ten-day provision would not be enforced as\r                                                          \r\n\na ground for termination, all in order to avoid liability for\r\n\nan ERISA-based medical disability claim.  See id. at 1094. \r                                                             \r\n\n          First,  short  of  ignoring  the  summary  judgment\r\n\nprescripts that  all credibility  assessments and  reasonable\r\n\ninferences are to  favor Barbour, see id. at  1091, it cannot\r                                                     \r\n\nbe inferred that Barbour  was ever informed, until after  the\r                                                                         \r\n\nten-day period had expired,  that his employment could  be   \r                                      \r\n\nlet alone would be     terminated for tardiness in filing the\r                                             \r\n\nmedical certification form.  On  the other hand, the trier of\r\n\nfact   reasonably   could   infer   from  Barbour's   initial\r\n\nconversation with John  Wilkinson, at which time  Barbour was\r\n\nhanded an undated medical  certification form, that Wilkinson\r\n\nimplicitly assured him  that the ten-day provision  would not\r\n\nbe enforced against him.   Such an inference is  strengthened\r\n\nby the  December 15 statement  Nickles made to  Barbour, that\r\n\nthough a certified letter had been sent to Barbour, he should\r\n\nnot \"get shook.  We will work with you but keep in touch.\"  \r\n\n          Second, even after Barbour was notified that he had\r\n\nbeen  terminated, he  received decidedly  mixed signals  from\r\n\nDRC.    Although  Nickles  informed  him  that  he  had  been\r\n\nterminated, her superior    Wilkinson    as late  as December\r                                    \r\n\n31 held open  the prospect that DRC would  accept the medical\r\n\nform.

By then, of course, it was too late. \r\n\n          Finally,  the  bald  statement in  the  December 22\r\n\ntermination letter  that  DRC had  presumed     based on  his\r                                                       \r\n\nfailure  to return  the  medical forms      that Barbour  had\r\n\nvoluntarily  terminated his  employment, notwithstanding  his\r                                   \r\n\nflat advice to the contrary on  December 18, see supra p.  4,\r                                                                  \r\n\nand  his ongoing efforts  to obtain medical  certification at\r\n\nDRC's suggestion, imperatively bespeaks pretext and mendacity\r\n\nwith sufficient  clarity to  demonstrate that the  inferences\r\n\nrelied  on by  DRC, and  endorsed  by the  majority, are  not\r\n\ncompelled.8  \r                     \r\n\n          Since   it  cannot   be  demonstrated       without\r\n\nindulging    impermissible    inferences    and   credibility\r\n\nassessments     that a rational factfinder would be compelled\r                                                                         \r\n\nto find that  DRC did not actively encourage  Barbour to take\r                                     \r\n\nmedical   disability    leave   before    obtaining   medical\r\n\ncertification, then  lull him  into the  fateful belief  that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.

Barbour sued his former employer, Dynamics Research Corporation (\"DRC\"), claiming that DRC terminated his employment to avoid paying disability benefits, in violation of section 510 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1140.  The district court granted summary judgment for DRC, and we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1985, DRC, an Andover, Massachusetts company, hired Barbour as a staff engineer.  Although Barbour was performing his job satisfactorily, his supervisor, Earl Zimmerman, began to complain to Barbour in September 1987 that Barbour's breath smelled of alcohol.  Barbour and Zimmerman discussed Barbour's alcohol problem, and Zimmerman suggested that Barbour apply for a medical leave of absence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For employees with a medically certified disability, DRC provides company-funded short-term disability benefits.  The short-term disability plan provides a disabled employee with up to 75% of his or her salary.  After six months elapses, an employee who is still disabled must then apply for long-term disability benefits, which are provided through a funded insurance program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DRC employees applying for short-term benefits receive two documents.  The first, a Medical Leave of Absence Notice (the \"Disability Notice\") describes the employee's rights and responsibilities under the program and requires certain information and an employee signature.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The second form, a Physician's Certification of Disability form (the \"Certification Form\") is to be completed by the employee's physician and returned to DRC's benefits office.  The Disability Notice states that the employee</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>must submit a completed Physician's Certification of Disability form (or a comparable note on physician's letterhead).  This must be received in the benefits office within 10 days of the date your leave commences or the date of this notice, whichever is later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ten-day requirement also appears in a memorandum dated July 1, 1987, from DRC's benefits administrator, Patricia Nickles, to department managers.  The memorandum provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>[t]he employee has 10 days from the first day out to submit the signed medical leave letter and written medical certification to the Benefits office.  If this timeframe is not met, a time card will not be processed....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or around December 4, 1987, Barbour went to see DRC's vice president of human resources, John Wilkinson, to discuss the process of applying for short-term disability benefits.  During his meeting with Wilkinson, Barbour received an undated Disability Notice and a Certification Form.  Barbour claims that Wilkinson told him the Disability Notice was undated in order to give him more time to obtain certification.  On December 7, without any apparent employer permission, Barbour commenced his absence from work.  On this same day, Barbour brought the Certification Form to the office of Dr. Kenneth Prescott, a hematologist who had been treating him for protracted bleeding.  Dr. Prescott was on vacation but his nurse informed Barbour that the doctor would return on December 16 and would complete the form at that time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 10, Nickles sent a certified letter to Barbour, stating that unless the Certification Form was returned to her office by December 18--eleven days after Barbour commenced his leave--she would assume he had chosen voluntarily to terminate his employment.  This letter was never received by Barbour as it was incorrectly addressed.  Although Nickles told Barbour about the letter during a December 15 phone conversation, Barbour claims that Nickles did not specifically tell him that he would be terminated if the certification was not received by December 18.  Barbour states that Nickles told him that he would be receiving a form letter but that he should not \"get shook\" and that DRC \"will work with you but keep in touch.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 16, Dr. Prescott told Barbour that he was unwilling to sign the Certification Form and that it should be taken to a general practitioner.  Because Barbour was not under the care of a general practitioner at that time, he experienced difficulty in obtaining an immediate appointment.  Barbour says that he attempted to contact Wilkinson on December 16 to inform him of the delay, but claims that Wilkinson failed to return his phone calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 22, Wilkinson called Barbour to ask about the status of the Certification Form.  After learning that Barbour had yet to set up an appointment with a general practitioner, Wilkinson suggested that Barbour continue his efforts at obtaining certification and told him that \"they would try to jump the hurdles.\"   In the meantime, however, Nickles and Wilkinson decided to begin the termination process and on December 22 mailed a certified letter to Barbour stating that his employment was being terminated for failure to comply with the ten-day deadline.  This letter too was mistakenly sent to the wrong address and was not received by Barbour until January 10, 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 30, Barbour finally saw Dr. Lawrence McCartin, a general practitioner.  During the appointment, Dr. McCartin told Barbour that he was suffering from a number of alcohol-related disabilities, including hypertension.  Barbour asked the doctor to indicate on the Certification Form that his disability was caused by hypertension as he did not want alcoholism documented in his personnel file.  Barbour picked up the completed form from Dr. McCartin's office on December 31 and delivered it to DRC on January 4, 1988, the next business day.  The form was stamped by Dr. McCartin and stated that Barbour was disabled \"indefinitely\" beginning December 18, 1987, due to hypertension.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon receipt of the Certification Form, DRC proceeded to review Barbour's disability claim.  On January 7, Nickles called Dr. McCartin's office and learned that Dr. McCartin had seen Barbour only once, on December 30, two weeks after Barbour's disability allegedly began.  She also learned that Barbour had missed a follow-up appointment with Dr. McCartin scheduled for January 7.  DRC claims that, based on these circumstances, along with the fact that Barbour had not listed alcoholism as the cause of disability, it chose not to accept the form as a valid certification of disability and did not reinstate Barbour.  Nickles, in informing Barbour of DRC's decision by letter on January 7, stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>Unfortunately, I [Nickles] am unable to consider your claim for disability benefits.  As you already know, it was your responsibility to submit this documentation by December 18, 1987.  Since we did not receive your paperwork by this deadline, you were considered to have voluntarily terminated your employment with DRC retroactive to December 4, 1987.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record indicates that Barbour was the first employee ever terminated for failure to submit the Certification Form within ten days and that Certification Forms of other employees were received by DRC after the deadline had elapsed (between three and twenty days late).  These employees apparently were not terminated or denied disability benefits.  The record also suggests that there were other instances in which employees turned in insufficient Certification Forms and it is not disputed that these employees were allowed to supplement their original forms, even though the ten-day period had expired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Barbour was terminated, he sought no medical treatment for a period of nine months.  In August 1988, Barbour stopped drinking but continued to suffer from a number of alcohol-related illnesses.  On April 5, 1991, the Social Security Administration adjudicated Barbour to have been disabled since December 4, 1987, the approximate date that his absence from work commenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1992, Barbour commenced this action in Massachusetts state court under section 510 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1140, alleging that DRC terminated him in order to deprive him of disability benefits.  DRC subsequently removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  At the close of discovery, both parties moved for summary judgment.  The district court granted DRC's motion, and Barbour thereafter filed a motion to reconsider.  Upon the district court's refusal to reconsider, this appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Summary Judgment Standard</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As always, we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.   Like the district court, we view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, drawing all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.  Woods v. Friction Materials, Inc., 30 F.3d 255, 259 (1st Cir.1994).  Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  As a prerequisite to summary judgment, a moving party must demonstrate \"an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case.\"  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2554, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).  Once the moving party has properly supported its motion for summary judgment, the burden shifts to the non-moving party, who \"may not rest on mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but must set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.\"  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2514, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even in an ERISA case \"where elusive concepts such as motive or intent are at issue, summary judgment may be appropriate if the nonmoving party rests merely upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\"  Goldman v. First Nat'l Bank of Boston, 985 F.2d 1113, 1116 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1990)).  Thus, Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) \"mandates the entry of summary judgment ... upon motion against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which the party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\"  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. at 2552.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Proving an ERISA section 510 Case</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Legal Framework</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Section 510 of ERISA provides in part:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan ... for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled under the plan....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. Sec. 1140 (emphasis supplied).  The ultimate inquiry in a section 510 case is whether the employment action was taken with the specific intent of interfering with the employee's ERISA benefits.  Clark v. Coats &amp; Clark, Inc., 990 F.2d 1217, 1222 (11th Cir.1993);  Biggins v. Hazen Paper Co., 953 F.2d 1405, 1417 (1st Cir.1992), vacated and remanded on other grounds, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1701, 123 L.Ed.2d 338 (1993);  McGann v. H &amp; H Music Co., 946 F.2d 401, 404 (5th Cir.1991).  This \"specific intent\" requirement derives from the language of the ERISA statute (\"for the purpose of interfering\") and is necessary \"to separate the firings which have an incidental, albeit important, effect on an employee's ... rights from the actionable firings, in which the effect of the firing on the employer's ... obligation was a motivating factor.\"  Dister v. Continental Group, Inc., 859 F.2d 1108, 1111 (2d Cir.1988).  Thus, no ERISA cause of action will lie where the loss of benefits was a mere consequence of, but not a motivating factor behind, a termination of employment.  Id.  Without such a requirement, every discharged employee could have a potential claim against his or her employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In most cases, given that the employer controls the evidence related to intent, a plaintiff will be unable to adduce \"smoking gun\" evidence that the employer intended to interfere with his or her benefits.  An employer is unlikely to document such a motive, and there is rarely \"eyewitness testimony as to the employer's mental processes.\"  Dister, 859 F.2d at 1112 (quoting United States Postal Serv.  Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 716, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 1482, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983)).  Therefore, a plaintiff usually must rely on circumstantial evidence to prove his or her case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a plaintiff must resort to such evidence, the burden-shifting analysis used in Title VII employment discrimination cases is especially helpful.  It \"enables the trial judge to sift through the evidence in an orderly fashion to determine the ultimate question in the case--did the defendant discriminate against the plaintiff.\"  Dillon v. Coles, 746 F.2d 998, 1003 (3d Cir.1984).  Accordingly, a number of circuits have applied the McDonnell Douglas framework to section 510 claims.  See, e.g., Humphreys v. Bellaire Corp., 966 F.2d 1037 (6th Cir.1992);  Rath v. Selection Research, Inc., 978 F.2d 1087 (8th Cir.1992);  Conkwright v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 933 F.2d 231 (4th Cir.1991);  Dister, 859 F.2d at 1108;  Gavalik v. Continental Can Co., 812 F.2d 834 (3d Cir.1987).  The district court appropriately employed the framework in this case, and we now do the same in assessing the propriety of the court's grant of defendant's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Prima Facie Case</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to establish a prima facie case under section 510, a plaintiff must present sufficient evidence from which the employer's specific intent to interfere with the plaintiff's benefits can be inferred.  Dister, 859 F.2d at 1114-15.   Thus, a plaintiff must show that he or she (1) is entitled to ERISA's protection, (2) was qualified for the position, and (3) was discharged under circumstances that give rise to an inference of discrimination.  Id. at 1115.   As in the Title VII context, the plaintiff's burden of proof at this stage is de minimis.  Id. at 1114-15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying this standard to the instant case, Barbour has met his initial burden of producing evidence to support each of the elements of his prima facie case.  First, Barbour is a member of the protected class under the ERISA statute because he had the opportunity to attain a right under an employee benefit plan.  Second, Barbour has provided evidence that he was performing satisfactorily in his job.  DRC's performance evaluations indicate that Barbour met the characteristics of a \"fully qualified experienced employee.\"   Finally, Barbour was attempting to obtain disability certification when the employment action was taken and benefits, if granted, would have been paid from defendant's general funds.  As the plaintiff's burden at the prima facie stage is de minimis, these circumstances are sufficient to give rise to an inference that DRC terminated Barbour in order to interfere with his disability benefits.  See Dister, 859 F.2d at 1114 (plaintiff's discharge four months before certain pension benefits were due to vest, together with the substantial cost savings to the employer in denying pension benefits, were sufficient to raise an inference of specific intent at the prima facie stage);  Zappia v. Nynex Information, No. 90-11366-Y, 1993 WL 437676, at * 3 (D.Mass. Oct. 22, 1993) (employee's discharge while receiving disability benefits gives rise to a presumption of intent at the prima facie stage).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Defendant's Non-Discriminatory Reason</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, a presumption arises that the defendant acted unlawfully in denying the plaintiff ERISA benefits.  See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2747, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) (Title VII).  In Title VII cases, \"[t]his presumption 'places upon the defendant the burden of producing an explanation to rebut the prima facie case--i.e., the burden of producing evidence that the adverse employment actions were taken for a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason.' \"  Udo v. Tomes, 54 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting Hicks, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2747).   In the ERISA context, this burden remains the same.  Dister, 859 F.2d at 1115.   Thus, the defendant must establish a legitimate, \"non-discriminatory\" reason--i.e., one unrelated to the plaintiff's entitlement to ERISA benefits--for its actions toward the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DRC claims that it terminated Barbour for failing to report to work or submit any medical certification of disability within ten days of the commencement of his leave.  Although Barbour disputes the veracity of this justification, it is enough to satisfy DRC's \"relatively light\" burden.  Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 763 (3d Cir.1994).  As the Supreme Court stated in Hicks, \"the determination that a defendant has met its burden of production (and has thus rebutted any legal presumption of intentional discrimination) can involve no credibility assessment.

The burden of production shifts back to the plaintiff, who must prove that the defendant acted with the specific intent of interfering with the plaintiff's benefits.  Id.  Thus, in order to survive a motion for summary judgment, a plaintiff must introduce evidence sufficient to support two findings:  (1) that the employer's articulated reason for its employment actions was a pretext;  and (2) that the true reason was to interfere with the plaintiff's receipt of benefits.  See Udo, 54 F.3d at 13 (citing Smith v. Stratus Computer, Inc., 40 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1958, 131 L.Ed.2d 850 (1995)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour argues that Hicks precludes summary judgment where there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the defendant's proffered reasons are a pretext.  Barbour contends that under Hicks, where the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and has shown that the employer's reasons are not worthy of credence, no additional proof of intent is required for the trier of fact to infer that the employer intended to interfere with the employee's benefits.  Barbour bases his argument on the passage in Hicks in which the Court stated that \"[t]he factfinder's disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of the prima facie case, suffice to show intentional discrimination.\"  Hicks, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2749.   Barbour's argument, however, was foreclosed by our decision in Woods, in which we interpreted the quoted passage from Hicks to make clear</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>that the Supreme Court envisioned that some cases exist where a prima facie case and the disbelief of pretext could provide a strong enough inference of actual discrimination to permit the factfinder to find for the plaintiff.  Conversely, we do not think that the Supreme Court meant to say that such a finding would always be permissible....  The strength of the prima facie case and the significance of the disbelieved pretext will vary from case to case depending on the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woods, 30 F.3d at 261 n. 3.   Thus, whether the plaintiff relies solely on his prima facie case and evidence of pretext or has additional evidence of specific intent as well, the plaintiff must always adduce evidence sufficient for a rational jury to conclude that the employer's action was motivated by an intent to interfere with ERISA benefits.  Because Barbour relies largely on the same evidence to prove both pretext and specific intent, we now assess the sum of that evidence and explain why it is insufficient to carry Barbour's burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour points to several facts both disputed and undisputed that he claims could lead a reasonable juror to infer that DRC's motivation was to interfere with his receipt of disability benefits.  Barbour contends that he was deliberately led into a situation in which DRC could use a nonexistent rule to terminate him.  As evidence of this, Barbour points to Wilkinson's provision of an undated Disability Notice on December 4 in order to give him more time to obtain certification, Nickles's alleged failure to state specifically that the Certification Form had to be returned by a particular date,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and Wilkinson's instruction to Barbour on December 22 that he should continue with his efforts to obtain certification despite his difficulties.  We fail to see how a rational jury could conclude from these facts that DRC deliberately misled Barbour into believing he could take as much time as he needed to submit the Certification Form.  No reasonable employee would assume that he or she had an unlimited time period in which to justify an absence.  Here, the Disability Notice Barbour received stated very clearly that a certification of disability had to be provided no later than ten days from the date of the form or the commencement of the leave, whichever was later.  Since the Disability Notice was undated, Barbour had unequivocal notice that his ten-day period began to run on December 7, when he voluntarily commenced his leave.  That Wilkinson and Nickles told Barbour to continue with his certification efforts when it was apparent that he could not comply with the deadline does not in any way indicate a deliberate plan to mislead;  to the contrary, it demonstrates that they were still willing to consider his claim.  Barbour's own account of his conversation with Wilkinson on December 22 indicates that Wilkinson essentially told Barbour that DRC would see what it could do although he made no promises.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour also argues that the fact that the penalty of termination for failure to comply with the ten-day deadline is not stated in any of DRC's written policies is evidence that DRC fabricated the \"policy\" in order to interfere with his benefits.  In support of this argument, Barbour directs us to the undisputed fact that he was the first employee ever terminated by DRC for failing to comply with the deadline.  In addition, Barbour presents Certification Forms of other employees submitted after the deadline had elapsed and there is no evidence indicating that these employees were terminated or denied disability benefits for their late submissions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Barbour, we agree with the district court that at most these facts show that DRC may have acted inconsistently in its application of the policy regarding employees who turned in their Certification Forms late.  Such evidence, standing alone, is insufficient to demonstrate intent unless the inconsistent application is linked with a motivation to deprive the employee of benefits.  See, e.g., Fong v. American Airlines, Inc., 626 F.2d 759, 762 (9th Cir.1980);  Teumer v. General Motors Corp., 840 F.Supp. 538, 548-50 (N.D.Ill.1993) (holding that in an action under section 510 of ERISA, the plaintiff cannot show pretext simply by demonstrating that the defendant applied its recall policy in an inconsistent manner, but must adduce facts that allow the court to infer that the defendant had the specific intent of interfering with plaintiff's benefits), aff'd, 34 F.3d 542 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we do not believe that specific intent can be inferred from the fact that Barbour was the first employee ever terminated for missing the ten-day deadline.  The Disability Notice clearly states that an employee must provide medical certification within ten days;  as we stated above, no reasonable employee would assume that he or she had an unlimited time in which to provide it.  The summary judgment record indicates that DRC's decision not to terminate other employees who submitted Certification Forms late were based on extenuating circumstances absent from this case.  For example, DRC had previously extended the deadline when an employee's physician contacted DRC and advised it that he or she would be unable to complete the form within the specified time period.  Similarly, extensions were also granted where an employee was hospitalized and unable to complete the form in a timely manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, DRC was never contacted by a physician regarding Barbour's illness, and Barbour was not hospitalized.  Having received the Disability Notice clearly notifying him of the ten-day deadline, Barbour then failed to obtain an appointment with a physician willing to sign the form until December 30.  While the delay in obtaining a doctor's signature may not have been entirely his fault, it was Barbour's choice to begin his absence on December 7, without any assurance that he would obtain certification of disability within ten days.  By December 22, DRC had not received any certification of disability and Barbour had informed Wilkinson that no future doctor's appointment had been arranged.  It was this circumstance that caused DRC to mail the December 22 termination letter to Barbour.  An employer need not remain idle indefinitely while an employee is absent without excuse.  While DRC may have chosen not to discharge other employees for missing the certification deadline, Barbour's case does not present similar extenuating circumstances and, therefore, specific intent cannot be inferred from DRC's actions.  Cf. Stratus, 40 F.3d at 17 (Title VII plaintiff alleging disparate treatment must show that he or she was treated differently from persons similarly situated in all relevant aspects).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, DRC's actions when Barbour finally did submit certification make Barbour's claim of unlawful motivation even more implausible.  Despite Barbour's failure to comply with express company policy, DRC nevertheless reviewed Barbour's disability claim on January 7.  Although the form was submitted over two weeks late, Nickles called Dr. McCartin to inquire about the listed disability of \"hypertension.\"   Based on what she learned in that conversation, DRC chose not to accept Barbour's form as a valid certification of disability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Even if DRC was mistaken in its evaluation of Barbour's disability, as long as that determination was in good faith and formed the basis of the decision it is permissible under section 510.  Zappia, 1993 WL 437676 at * 3.   Barbour has failed to produce any evidence of bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour next argues that specific intent can be inferred from the mere fact that DRC knew he was in the process of applying for benefits at the time of termination.  It is undisputed that Barbour informed Wilkinson on or around December 4 that he was considering applying for disability leave.  It is also undisputed that during their discussion, Barbour and Wilkinson discussed the odor of alcohol on Barbour's breath and the possibility of an alcohol problem.  However, these facts add little to Barbour's proof:  \"[E]ven if [Barbour] could establish that [DRC] knew that [Barbour] definitely planned to apply for ... disability benefits, he would still be required to offer some evidence that this knowledge somehow influenced\" DRC's employment actions.  Corcoran v. GAB Business Servs., Inc., 723 F.Supp. 966, 971 (S.D.N.Y.1989).  As was the case in Corcoran, Barbour has failed to produce any evidence suggesting that the prospect of paying disability benefits influenced DRC's decisions.  To the contrary, we find it significant that the option of a medical leave of absence was first suggested by DRC.  Barbour's supervisor, Zimmerman, approached Barbour and suggested that he apply for a medical leave to address his alcohol problem.  Prior to their discussion, Barbour was unaware that he would even qualify for disability benefits.  We think it is highly unlikely that DRC would have suggested such an option if it ultimately intended to deprive Barbour of benefits:  DRC had no way of knowing that Barbour would fail to submit the proper documentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour finally suggests that a factfinder could infer unlawful intent if DRC imposed criteria on Barbour that were harsher than that imposed on other employees whose illnesses were less likely to lead to permanent long-term disability.  Even if such an inference would be permissible, Barbour has produced no evidence that his illness was more likely to lead to long-term disability.  In fact, the evidence strongly suggests that DRC would have granted Barbour disability benefits had he submitted appropriate documentation of his alcohol condition.  In 1987 and 1988, DRC provided disability benefits to all seventy-six other employees who applied for disability benefits.  Of these, at least sixteen employees applied for and received disability benefits for conditions related to the abuse of alcohol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we hold that Barbour has failed to present evidence that would enable a reasonable jury to conclude that DRC's actions were motivated by a desire to interfere with Barbour's benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Barbour has failed to raise an issue of fact as to whether DRC intended to interfere with his ERISA benefits, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of DRC on Barbour's ERISA claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CYR, Circuit Judge (dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court aptly acknowledges, supra at p. 39, that an inference of intentional discrimination is \"particularly\" appropriate where a \"finding of pretext is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity,\" Hicks, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2749, but then abandons basic summary judgment procedure en route to its holding that fair findings of pretext and suspicion of mendacity are precluded on the present record.  Allowed their rightful role, the incumbent requirements that all credibility assessments and fair inferences be indulged favorably to the party resisting summary judgment, Woodman v. Haemonetics Corp., 51 F.3d 1087, 1091 (1st Cir.1995), do not admit of the findings the court deems compelled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conspicuously affected by alcoholism and in poor health, Barbour had used much of his sick leave by December 4, 1987.  On that day, his supervisor, Earl Zimmerman, called Barbour aside and asked whether he had considered taking long-term medical disability leave (\"medical disability leave\").  Upon learning that Barbour had never considered it, Zimmerman urged him to do so:  \"It's a good deal, and I don't see why you shouldn't qualify for it.  I really would like to call John Wilkinson [DRC vice-president for human resources] ... and tell him you are on the way down to see him and do that.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Zimmerman's advice, Barbour went to see Wilkinson, who handed him an undated medical disability leave form to be returned \"within 10 days of the date your leave commences or the date of this notice, whichever is later.\"  (emphasis added).  The form itself made no mention that failure to file on time could result in termination, nor did Wilkinson ever mention that it should be returned by a date certain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 7, Barbour went on medical disability leave.  Three days later, Patricia Nickles, the benefits administrator for DRC, mailed a certified letter warning that Barbour could be terminated if he did not return the enclosed medical certification form (dated December 10) by December 18.  As the letter was misaddressed, Barbour never received it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no record evidence that DRC had ever terminated or threatened to terminate an employee for failing to comply with the ten-day filing provision.  Rather, on at least ten occasions DRC had accepted late medical certification forms.  Moreover, this marked the first time that any DRC employee had ever been threatened with adverse action before the ten-day filing period had expired.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 15, Barbour called to advise Nickles that he had been unable to return the medical form because his physician had been on vacation.  During their conversation, Barbour informed Nickles that he had never received a certified letter dated December 10.  In response, Nickles simply reassured Barbour that a \"form letter [had been] sent out.  Don't get shook.  We will work with you but keep in touch.\"   She never mentioned that failure to return the completed form within the next three days could, let alone would, lead to Barbour's termination.  Moreover, though she knew Barbour had never received the December 10 letter warning that termination could result unless the form were returned by December 18, Nickles neither mailed nor handed Barbour another copy, nor did she ask for Barbour's correct mailing address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 16, Barbour's physician, a specialist in hematology, advised him that the certification form should be completed by a general practitioner.  Although Barbour left telephone messages with John Wilkinson's office, so informing him, the calls were never returned.  Two days later, on December 18--unbeknownst to Barbour the deadline for filing the medical form--he left a telephone message for Nickles:  \"If you don't reach [me] this morning, [I'll] get to you this afternoon.  Having trouble getting doctor's signature.  [Don't ] want to terminate.\"  (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 21, after conferring with Wilkinson, Nickles telephoned to tell Barbour that he had been terminated for failure to return the medical forms by December 18.  During their telephone conversation, Barbour volunteered his correct mailing address.  On December 22, Nickles mailed Barbour a notice of voluntary termination based on his failure to return the required medical form by December 18.  That same day, in the belief that Wilkinson, rather than Nickles, had the authority to act in behalf of DRC, Barbour contacted Wilkinson and was told to continue to seek medical certification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 30, Barbour was examined by a general practitioner, who diagnosed hypertension.  At 9:45 a.m. the following day, Barbour was advised by the doctor's office that the signed medical certification form could be picked up.  Barbour immediately informed Wilkinson, through his secretary, that the form had been signed.  The record is silent as to whether he told the secretary that he did not yet have the form in hand. The secretary told Barbour that was \"fine\" and Barbour should \"bring [the] form over today.\"  (emphasis added).  Thus, as late as December 31, DRC had evinced its readiness to receive the medical form.  See id. at 1094 (vicarious admissions by employee).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour did not pick up the form on December 31, due to car trouble.  When he called DRC during the afternoon of December 31 to explain the delay, no one answered the telephone.  Due to the New Year holiday, the medical certification form was not received by Barbour until January 4, 1988, the next business day.  He delivered it to DRC the same day.  Yet on January 7, after conferring with Wilkinson, Nickles sent a certified letter to Barbour informing him that his claim for medical benefits would not be considered because Barbour had failed to comply with the ten-day filing provision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  On January 10, 1988, Barbour finally received the missent termination letter dated December 22, 1987.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A rational factfinder reasonably could infer from the foregoing evidence that DRC not only induced Barbour to take medical disability leave but that it utilized its hitherto dormant ten-day filing provision as a pretext for terminating Barbour after it had misled and lulled him into believing that the ten-day provision would not be enforced as a ground for termination, all in order to avoid liability for an ERISA-based medical disability claim.  See id. at 1094.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, short of ignoring the summary judgment prescripts that all credibility assessments and reasonable inferences are to favor Barbour, see id. at 1091, it cannot be inferred that Barbour was ever informed, until after the ten-day period had expired, that his employment could be--let alone would be--terminated for tardiness in filing the medical certification form.  On the other hand, the trier of fact reasonably could infer from Barbour's initial conversation with John Wilkinson, at which time Barbour was handed an undated medical certification form, that Wilkinson implicitly assured him that the ten-day provision would not be enforced against him.  Such an inference is strengthened by the December 15 statement Nickles made to Barbour, that though a certified letter had been sent to Barbour, he should not \"get shook.  We will work with you but keep in touch.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even after Barbour was notified that he had been terminated, he received decidedly mixed signals from DRC.  Although Nickles informed him that he had been terminated, her superior--Wilkinson--as late as December 31 held open the prospect that DRC would accept the medical form.  Not until January 10, 1988, when he finally received the misaddressed December 22, 1987, termination letter, and the January 7 letter informing him that the disability claim application would not be considered, was Barbour unambiguously informed of the consequences of failing to comply with the ten-day provision.  By then, of course, it was too late.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the bald statement in the December 22 termination letter that DRC had presumed--based on his failure to return the medical forms--that Barbour had voluntarily terminated his employment, notwithstanding his flat advice to the contrary on December 18, see supra p. 43, and his ongoing efforts to obtain medical certification at DRC's suggestion, imperatively bespeaks pretext and mendacity with sufficient clarity to demonstrate that the inferences relied on by DRC, and endorsed by the majority, are not compelled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since it cannot be demonstrated--without indulging impermissible inferences and credibility assessments--that a rational factfinder would be compelled to find that DRC did not actively encourage Barbour to take medical disability leave before obtaining medical certification, then lull him into the fateful belief that strict compliance with its ambivalent ten-day filing policy would not be enforced, id. at 1094-95 (prima facie case, combined with showing of pretext and suspicion of mendacity, precludes summary judgment on issue of intentional discrimination);  see generally, Hicks, --- U.S. at ----, ---- n. 4 &amp; ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2749, 2749 n. 4 &amp; 2756 (where plaintiff adduces enough competent evidence to support inference of discrimination, the case must go to the trier of fact), I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The record does not indicate when and if this form was returned and neither party focuses on this document</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> DRC disputes this allegation and claims that Nickles told Barbour on two occasions that the Certification Form was due in the benefits office by December 18.  Even Barbour concedes that Nickles told him to return the form \"as early as possible.\"   Because this is a motion for summary judgment, however, we will review the facts in the light most favorable to Barbour</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> With respect to our dissenting brother, his characterization of this conversation is but one in a series of skewed presentations of the evidence that, taken together, he argues would permit a rational jury to conclude that DRC managers conspired to \"induce\" Barbour to take medical leave and \"lull\" him into believing there would be no consequences for failing to return the medical forms on time.  First, the dissent suggests that DRC had approved a \"medical disability leave\" when Barbour voluntarily began his absence from work on December 7.  Infra at 42.  Although DRC provided Barbour with the proper forms, the record contains no support for the inference that Barbour's absence beginning on that day was approved or induced by DRC.  Our brother finds further support for his conspiracy theory in the fact that on December 22, Barbour was \"told [by Wilkinson] to continue to seek medical certification.\"   Infra at 43.  Barbour's own notes, however, state that Wilkinson actually told him that he should \"keep going with the Dr. certificate and they would try to jump hurdles,\" and that \"we will see if we can salvage this thing.\"   Wilkinson's choice of words belies Barbour's assertion that DRC soft-pedaled the trouble he was in.  The assertion is further belied by Barbour's own notes of his conversation with Nickles on December 15, in which he recorded that Nickles told him that he should not \"get shook\" by the form letter she had sent him, and by Barbour's December 18 message for Nickles in which he told her that he did not want to terminate.  See infra at 42.  Why should Barbour \"get shook\" at all by a form letter unless he knew it contained some kind of ominous warning?   And, if Barbour had no idea that he was flirting with termination on December 18, why did he leave a message for Nickles stating that he did \"not want to terminate\"?   The particular inferences the dissent would permit the jury to draw from this (and other) evidence--that DRC lured an unwary Barbour into a bureaucratic trap--are patently unreasonable on this record</p>\n        <p>Similarly misleading is the dissent's suggestion that DRC's misaddressing of the December 10 letter to Barbour, and, in the dissent's underlined language, the fact that Nickles \"did [not] ask for Barbour's correct mailing address\" when she spoke to him on December 15, were evidence of nefarious doings.  Infra at 43 n. 5.  The December 10 letter was addressed to Barbour at \"P.O. Box 215, 88 Rogers.\"   He had apparently stopped using the postal box;  the street address, however, was correct.  One cannot rationally infer from this that Nickles intended that Barbour would not receive the letter;  the fact that Nickles put both addresses on the envelopes--with at least a reasonable probability that the postal service would direct the envelope to the correct address--is mighty strong evidence of mistake and not deliberation.  That Nickles failed to ask for Barbour's correct mailing address, simply in light of the fact that a letter sent a few day earlier had not arrived yet, is of even less evidentiary value;  it proves absolutely nothing.</p>\n        <p>To cite a final example of the dissent's indefensible inference-drawing, we are at a loss to understand what possible weight is added to Barbour's case by the statements of Wilkinson's secretary to Barbour on December 31.

Even assuming that the secretary's statements concerned matters within the scope of her employment, what permissible negative inference could a rational jury draw from the fact that DRC \"evinced its readiness to receive the medical form\" even after Barbour had been formally terminated?   Whatever inferential leap our brother is making here escapes us.</p>\n        <p>Contrary to the dissent's characterization of our holding, we do not mean to imply that the total assemblage of evidence compels a particular conclusion;  rather, we hold that the conclusion that Barbour would have a rational jury draw--namely, that DRC set Barbour up to apply for medical leave so that it could fire him, and then lied about it--is impermissible based on this evidence.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In fact, DRC set forth five justifications for its decision to deny Barbour's disability claim:  (1) Dr. McCartin did not see Barbour until December 30, two weeks after the disability allegedly began;  (2) the condition listed on the form, \"hypertension,\" was different than the alcohol problem or bleeding condition which was expected given Barbour's previous statements to DRC supervisors;  (3) Barbour appeared to have been \"shopping around\" for a physician after Dr. Prescott refused to complete the form;  (4) the length of disability (undetermined) did not coincide with medical guidelines;  and (5) Barbour failed to keep his follow-up appointment with Dr. McCartin scheduled for January 7</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Although DRC had the correct street address, the letter had been addressed to a post office box (as well as a street address) which Barbour had relinquished sometime after he moved in 1984</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> On one other occasion, in early 1988, DRC warned an employee nineteen days after the ten-day period had elapsed.

Barbour sued his former employer, Dynamics Research Corporation (\"DRC\"), claiming that DRC terminated his employment to avoid paying disability benefits, in violation of section 510 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1140.  The district court granted summary judgment for DRC, and we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1985, DRC, an Andover, Massachusetts company, hired Barbour as a staff engineer.  Although Barbour was performing his job satisfactorily, his supervisor, Earl Zimmerman, began to complain to Barbour in September 1987 that Barbour's breath smelled of alcohol.  Barbour and Zimmerman discussed Barbour's alcohol problem, and Zimmerman suggested that Barbour apply for a medical leave of absence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For employees with a medically certified disability, DRC provides company-funded short-term disability benefits.  The short-term disability plan provides a disabled employee with up to 75% of his or her salary.  After six months elapses, an employee who is still disabled must then apply for long-term disability benefits, which are provided through a funded insurance program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DRC employees applying for short-term benefits receive two documents.  The first, a Medical Leave of Absence Notice (the \"Disability Notice\") describes the employee's rights and responsibilities under the program and requires certain information and an employee signature.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The second form, a Physician's Certification of Disability form (the \"Certification Form\") is to be completed by the employee's physician and returned to DRC's benefits office.  The Disability Notice states that the employee</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>must submit a completed Physician's Certification of Disability form (or a comparable note on physician's letterhead).  This must be received in the benefits office within 10 days of the date your leave commences or the date of this notice, whichever is later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ten-day requirement also appears in a memorandum dated July 1, 1987, from DRC's benefits administrator, Patricia Nickles, to department managers.  The memorandum provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>[t]he employee has 10 days from the first day out to submit the signed medical leave letter and written medical certification to the Benefits office.  If this timeframe is not met, a time card will not be processed....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or around December 4, 1987, Barbour went to see DRC's vice president of human resources, John Wilkinson, to discuss the process of applying for short-term disability benefits.  During his meeting with Wilkinson, Barbour received an undated Disability Notice and a Certification Form.  Barbour claims that Wilkinson told him the Disability Notice was undated in order to give him more time to obtain certification.  On December 7, without any apparent employer permission, Barbour commenced his absence from work.  On this same day, Barbour brought the Certification Form to the office of Dr. Kenneth Prescott, a hematologist who had been treating him for protracted bleeding.  Dr. Prescott was on vacation but his nurse informed Barbour that the doctor would return on December 16 and would complete the form at that time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 10, Nickles sent a certified letter to Barbour, stating that unless the Certification Form was returned to her office by December 18--eleven days after Barbour commenced his leave--she would assume he had chosen voluntarily to terminate his employment.  This letter was never received by Barbour as it was incorrectly addressed.  Although Nickles told Barbour about the letter during a December 15 phone conversation, Barbour claims that Nickles did not specifically tell him that he would be terminated if the certification was not received by December 18.  Barbour states that Nickles told him that he would be receiving a form letter but that he should not \"get shook\" and that DRC \"will work with you but keep in touch.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 16, Dr. Prescott told Barbour that he was unwilling to sign the Certification Form and that it should be taken to a general practitioner.  Because Barbour was not under the care of a general practitioner at that time, he experienced difficulty in obtaining an immediate appointment.  Barbour says that he attempted to contact Wilkinson on December 16 to inform him of the delay, but claims that Wilkinson failed to return his phone calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 22, Wilkinson called Barbour to ask about the status of the Certification Form.  After learning that Barbour had yet to set up an appointment with a general practitioner, Wilkinson suggested that Barbour continue his efforts at obtaining certification and told him that \"they would try to jump the hurdles.\"   In the meantime, however, Nickles and Wilkinson decided to begin the termination process and on December 22 mailed a certified letter to Barbour stating that his employment was being terminated for failure to comply with the ten-day deadline.  This letter too was mistakenly sent to the wrong address and was not received by Barbour until January 10, 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 30, Barbour finally saw Dr. Lawrence McCartin, a general practitioner.  During the appointment, Dr. McCartin told Barbour that he was suffering from a number of alcohol-related disabilities, including hypertension.  Barbour asked the doctor to indicate on the Certification Form that his disability was caused by hypertension as he did not want alcoholism documented in his personnel file.  Barbour picked up the completed form from Dr. McCartin's office on December 31 and delivered it to DRC on January 4, 1988, the next business day.  The form was stamped by Dr. McCartin and stated that Barbour was disabled \"indefinitely\" beginning December 18, 1987, due to hypertension.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon receipt of the Certification Form, DRC proceeded to review Barbour's disability claim.  On January 7, Nickles called Dr. McCartin's office and learned that Dr. McCartin had seen Barbour only once, on December 30, two weeks after Barbour's disability allegedly began.  She also learned that Barbour had missed a follow-up appointment with Dr. McCartin scheduled for January 7.  DRC claims that, based on these circumstances, along with the fact that Barbour had not listed alcoholism as the cause of disability, it chose not to accept the form as a valid certification of disability and did not reinstate Barbour.  Nickles, in informing Barbour of DRC's decision by letter on January 7, stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>Unfortunately, I [Nickles] am unable to consider your claim for disability benefits.  As you already know, it was your responsibility to submit this documentation by December 18, 1987.  Since we did not receive your paperwork by this deadline, you were considered to have voluntarily terminated your employment with DRC retroactive to December 4, 1987.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record indicates that Barbour was the first employee ever terminated for failure to submit the Certification Form within ten days and that Certification Forms of other employees were received by DRC after the deadline had elapsed (between three and twenty days late).  These employees apparently were not terminated or denied disability benefits.  The record also suggests that there were other instances in which employees turned in insufficient Certification Forms and it is not disputed that these employees were allowed to supplement their original forms, even though the ten-day period had expired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Barbour was terminated, he sought no medical treatment for a period of nine months.  In August 1988, Barbour stopped drinking but continued to suffer from a number of alcohol-related illnesses.  On April 5, 1991, the Social Security Administration adjudicated Barbour to have been disabled since December 4, 1987, the approximate date that his absence from work commenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1992, Barbour commenced this action in Massachusetts state court under section 510 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1140, alleging that DRC terminated him in order to deprive him of disability benefits.  DRC subsequently removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  At the close of discovery, both parties moved for summary judgment.  The district court granted DRC's motion, and Barbour thereafter filed a motion to reconsider.  Upon the district court's refusal to reconsider, this appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Summary Judgment Standard</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As always, we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.   Like the district court, we view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, drawing all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.  Woods v.

Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).

Once the moving party has properly supported its motion for summary judgment, the burden shifts to the non-moving party, who \"may not rest on mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but must set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.\"  Anderson v.

Thus, Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) \"mandates the entry of summary judgment ... upon motion against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which the party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111722\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Celotex,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111722/celotex-corporation-v-myrtle-nell-catrett-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span>, 106 S.Ct. at 2552.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

This \"specific intent\" requirement derives from the language of the ERISA statute (\"for the purpose of interfering\") and is necessary \"to separate the firings which have an incidental, albeit important, effect on an employee's ... rights from the actionable firings, in which the effect of the firing on the employer's ... obligation was a motivating factor.\"  Dister v.

First, Barbour is a member of the protected class under the ERISA statute because he had the opportunity to attain a right under an employee benefit plan.  Second, Barbour has provided evidence that he was performing satisfactorily in his job.  DRC's performance evaluations indicate that Barbour met the characteristics of a \"fully qualified experienced employee.\"   Finally, Barbour was attempting to obtain disability certification when the employment action was taken and benefits, if granted, would have been paid from defendant's general funds.  As the plaintiff's burden at the prima facie stage is de minimis, these circumstances are sufficient to give rise to an inference that DRC terminated Barbour in order to interfere with his disability benefits.

Barbour contends that under Hicks, where the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and has shown that the employer's reasons are not worthy of credence, no additional proof of intent is required for the trier of fact to infer that the employer intended to interfere with the employee's benefits.  Barbour bases his argument on the passage in Hicks in which the Court stated that \"[t]he factfinder's disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of the prima facie case, suffice to show intentional discrimination.\"  Hicks, --- U.S. at <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">----,</span> <span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Conversely, we do not think that the Supreme Court meant to say that such a finding would always be permissible....  The strength of the prima facie case and the significance of the disbelieved pretext will vary from case to case depending on the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675091\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Woods,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/675091/jimmie-e-woods-v-friction-materials-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">261</span> </a></span>n. 3.   Thus, whether the plaintiff relies solely on his prima facie case and evidence of pretext or has additional evidence of specific intent as well, the plaintiff must always adduce evidence sufficient for a rational jury to conclude that the employer's action was motivated by an intent to interfere with ERISA benefits.  Because Barbour relies largely on the same evidence to prove both pretext and specific intent, we now assess the sum of that evidence and explain why it is insufficient to carry Barbour's burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour points to several facts both disputed and undisputed that he claims could lead a reasonable juror to infer that DRC's motivation was to interfere with his receipt of disability benefits.  Barbour contends that he was deliberately led into a situation in which DRC could use a nonexistent rule to terminate him.  As evidence of this, Barbour points to Wilkinson's provision of an undated Disability Notice on December 4 in order to give him more time to obtain certification, Nickles's alleged failure to state specifically that the Certification Form had to be returned by a particular date,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and Wilkinson's instruction to Barbour on December 22 that he should continue with his efforts to obtain certification despite his difficulties.  We fail to see how a rational jury could conclude from these facts that DRC deliberately misled Barbour into believing he could take as much time as he needed to submit the Certification Form.  No reasonable employee would assume that he or she had an unlimited time period in which to justify an absence.  Here, the Disability Notice Barbour received stated very clearly that a certification of disability had to be provided no later than ten days from the date of the form or the commencement of the leave, whichever was later.  Since the Disability Notice was undated, Barbour had unequivocal notice that his ten-day period began to run on December 7, when he voluntarily commenced his leave.  That Wilkinson and Nickles told Barbour to continue with his certification efforts when it was apparent that he could not comply with the deadline does not in any way indicate a deliberate plan to mislead;  to the contrary, it demonstrates that they were still willing to consider his claim.  Barbour's own account of his conversation with Wilkinson on December 22 indicates that Wilkinson essentially told Barbour that DRC would see what it could do although he made no promises.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour also argues that the fact that the penalty of termination for failure to comply with the ten-day deadline is not stated in any of DRC's written policies is evidence that DRC fabricated the \"policy\" in order to interfere with his benefits.  In support of this argument, Barbour directs us to the undisputed fact that he was the first employee ever terminated by DRC for failing to comply with the deadline.  In addition, Barbour presents Certification Forms of other employees submitted after the deadline had elapsed and there is no evidence indicating that these employees were terminated or denied disability benefits for their late submissions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Barbour, we agree with the district court that at most these facts show that DRC may have acted inconsistently in its application of the policy regarding employees who turned in their Certification Forms late.  Such evidence, standing alone, is insufficient to demonstrate intent unless the inconsistent application is linked with a motivation to deprive the employee of benefits.  See, e.g., Fong v. American Airlines, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"380518\"><a href=\"/opinion/380518/23-fair-emplpraccas-1168-24-empl-prac-dec-p-31216-7-fed-r-evid/\"><span class=\"volume\">626</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">759</span></a></span>, 762 (9th Cir.1980);  Teumer v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></span>, 548-50 (N.D.Ill.1993) (holding that in an action under section 510 of ERISA, the plaintiff cannot show pretext simply by demonstrating that the defendant applied its recall policy in an inconsistent manner, but must adduce facts that allow the court to infer that the defendant had the specific intent of interfering with plaintiff's benefits), aff'd, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677389\"><a href=\"/opinion/677389/edmond-c-teumer-v-general-motors-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span> </a></span>(7th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we do not believe that specific intent can be inferred from the fact that Barbour was the first employee ever terminated for missing the ten-day deadline.  The Disability Notice clearly states that an employee must provide medical certification within ten days;  as we stated above, no reasonable employee would assume that he or she had an unlimited time in which to provide it.  The summary judgment record indicates that DRC's decision not to terminate other employees who submitted Certification Forms late were based on extenuating circumstances absent from this case.  For example, DRC had previously extended the deadline when an employee's physician contacted DRC and advised it that he or she would be unable to complete the form within the specified time period.  Similarly, extensions were also granted where an employee was hospitalized and unable to complete the form in a timely manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, DRC was never contacted by a physician regarding Barbour's illness, and Barbour was not hospitalized.  Having received the Disability Notice clearly notifying him of the ten-day deadline, Barbour then failed to obtain an appointment with a physician willing to sign the form until December 30.  While the delay in obtaining a doctor's signature may not have been entirely his fault, it was Barbour's choice to begin his absence on December 7, without any assurance that he would obtain certification of disability within ten days.  By December 22, DRC had not received any certification of disability and Barbour had informed Wilkinson that no future doctor's appointment had been arranged.  It was this circumstance that caused DRC to mail the December 22 termination letter to Barbour.  An employer need not remain idle indefinitely while an employee is absent without excuse.  While DRC may have chosen not to discharge other employees for missing the certification deadline, Barbour's case does not present similar extenuating circumstances and, therefore, specific intent cannot be inferred from DRC's actions.  Cf. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195745\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Stratus,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195745/smith-v-stratus-computers/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">17</span> </a></span>(Title VII plaintiff alleging disparate treatment must show that he or she was treated differently from persons similarly situated in all relevant aspects).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, DRC's actions when Barbour finally did submit certification make Barbour's claim of unlawful motivation even more implausible.  Despite Barbour's failure to comply with express company policy, DRC nevertheless reviewed Barbour's disability claim on January 7.  Although the form was submitted over two weeks late, Nickles called Dr. McCartin to inquire about the listed disability of \"hypertension.\"   Based on what she learned in that conversation, DRC chose not to accept Barbour's form as a valid certification of disability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Even if DRC was mistaken in its evaluation of Barbour's disability, as long as that determination was in good faith and formed the basis of the decision it is permissible under section 510.

It is undisputed that Barbour informed Wilkinson on or around December 4 that he was considering applying for disability leave.  It is also undisputed that during their discussion, Barbour and Wilkinson discussed the odor of alcohol on Barbour's breath and the possibility of an alcohol problem.  However, these facts add little to Barbour's proof:  \"[E]ven if [Barbour] could establish that [DRC] knew that [Barbour] definitely planned to apply for ... disability benefits, he would still be required to offer some evidence that this knowledge somehow influenced\" DRC's employment actions.  Corcoran v. GAB Business Servs., Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></span>, 971 (S.D.N.Y.1989).  As was the case in Corcoran, Barbour has failed to produce any evidence suggesting that the prospect of paying disability benefits influenced DRC's decisions.  To the contrary, we find it significant that the option of a medical leave of absence was first suggested by DRC.  Barbour's supervisor, Zimmerman, approached Barbour and suggested that he apply for a medical leave to address his alcohol problem.  Prior to their discussion, Barbour was unaware that he would even qualify for disability benefits.  We think it is highly unlikely that DRC would have suggested such an option if it ultimately intended to deprive Barbour of benefits:  DRC had no way of knowing that Barbour would fail to submit the proper documentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour finally suggests that a factfinder could infer unlawful intent if DRC imposed criteria on Barbour that were harsher than that imposed on other employees whose illnesses were less likely to lead to permanent long-term disability.  Even if such an inference would be permissible, Barbour has produced no evidence that his illness was more likely to lead to long-term disability.  In fact, the evidence strongly suggests that DRC would have granted Barbour disability benefits had he submitted appropriate documentation of his alcohol condition.  In 1987 and 1988, DRC provided disability benefits to all seventy-six other employees who applied for disability benefits.  Of these, at least sixteen employees applied for and received disability benefits for conditions related to the abuse of alcohol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we hold that Barbour has failed to present evidence that would enable a reasonable jury to conclude that DRC's actions were motivated by a desire to interfere with Barbour's benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Barbour has failed to raise an issue of fact as to whether DRC intended to interfere with his ERISA benefits, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of DRC on Barbour's ERISA claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CYR, Circuit Judge (dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court aptly <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">acknowledges,</span> supra </span>at p. 39, that an inference of intentional discrimination is \"particularly\" appropriate where a \"finding of pretext is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity,\" Hicks, --- U.S. at <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">----,</span> <span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On that day, his supervisor, Earl Zimmerman, called Barbour aside and asked whether he had considered taking long-term medical disability leave (\"medical disability leave\").  Upon learning that Barbour had never considered it, Zimmerman urged him to do so:  \"It's a good deal, and I don't see why you shouldn't qualify for it.  I really would like to call John Wilkinson [DRC vice-president for human resources] ... and tell him you are on the way down to see him and do that.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Zimmerman's advice, Barbour went to see Wilkinson, who handed him an undated medical disability leave form to be returned \"within 10 days of the date your leave commences or the date of this notice, whichever is later.\"  (emphasis added).

Three days later, Patricia Nickles, the benefits administrator for DRC, mailed a certified letter warning that Barbour could be terminated if he did not return the enclosed medical certification form (dated December 10) by December 18.  As the letter was misaddressed, Barbour never received it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no record evidence that DRC had ever terminated or threatened to terminate an employee for failing to comply with the ten-day filing provision.  Rather, on at least ten occasions DRC had accepted late medical certification forms.  Moreover, this marked the first time that any DRC employee had ever been threatened with adverse action before the ten-day filing period had expired.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 15, Barbour called to advise Nickles that he had been unable to return the medical form because his physician had been on vacation.

In response, Nickles simply reassured Barbour that a \"form letter [had been] sent out.  Don't get shook.  We will work with you but keep in touch.\"   She never mentioned that failure to return the completed form within the next three days could, let alone would, lead to Barbour's termination.  Moreover, though she knew Barbour had never received the December 10 letter warning that termination could result unless the form were returned by December 18, Nickles neither mailed nor handed Barbour another copy, nor did she ask for Barbour's correct mailing address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 16, Barbour's physician, a specialist in hematology, advised him that the certification form should be completed by a general practitioner.  Although Barbour left telephone messages with John Wilkinson's office, so informing him, the calls were never returned.  Two days later, on December 18--unbeknownst to Barbour the deadline for filing the medical form--he left a telephone message for Nickles:  \"If you don't reach [me] this morning, [I'll] get to you this afternoon.  Having trouble getting doctor's signature.  [Don't ] want to terminate.\"  (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 21, after conferring with Wilkinson, Nickles telephoned to tell Barbour that he had been terminated for failure to return the medical forms by December 18.  During their telephone conversation, Barbour volunteered his correct mailing address.  On December 22, Nickles mailed Barbour a notice of voluntary termination based on his failure to return the required medical form by December 18.  That same day, in the belief that Wilkinson, rather than Nickles, had the authority to act in behalf of DRC, Barbour contacted Wilkinson and was told to continue to seek medical certification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 30, Barbour was examined by a general practitioner, who diagnosed hypertension.  At 9:45 a.m. the following day, Barbour was advised by the doctor's office that the signed medical certification form could be picked up.  Barbour immediately informed Wilkinson, through his secretary, that the form had been signed.  The record is silent as to whether he told the secretary that he did not yet have the form in hand. The secretary told Barbour that was \"fine\" and Barbour should \"bring [the] form over today.\"  (emphasis added).  Thus, as late as December 31, DRC had evinced its readiness to receive the medical form.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196019\"><a href=\"/opinion/196019/woodman-v-heamonetics-corp/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1094 </a></span>(vicarious admissions by employee).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour did not pick up the form on December 31, due to car trouble.  When he called DRC during the afternoon of December 31 to explain the delay, no one answered the telephone.  Due to the New Year holiday, the medical certification form was not received by Barbour until January 4, 1988, the next business day.  He delivered it to DRC the same day.  Yet on January 7, after conferring with Wilkinson, Nickles sent a certified letter to Barbour informing him that his claim for medical benefits would not be considered because Barbour had failed to comply with the ten-day filing provision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  On January 10, 1988, Barbour finally received the missent termination letter dated December 22, 1987.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A rational factfinder reasonably could infer from the foregoing evidence that DRC not only induced Barbour to take medical disability leave but that it utilized its hitherto dormant ten-day filing provision as a pretext for terminating Barbour after it had misled and lulled him into believing that the ten-day provision would not be enforced as a ground for termination, all in order to avoid liability for an ERISA-based medical disability claim.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196019\"><a href=\"/opinion/196019/woodman-v-heamonetics-corp/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1094</a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, short of ignoring the summary judgment prescripts that all credibility assessments and reasonable inferences are to favor Barbour, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196019\"><a href=\"/opinion/196019/woodman-v-heamonetics-corp/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1091, </a></span>it cannot be inferred that Barbour was ever informed, until after the ten-day period had expired, that his employment could be--let alone would be--terminated for tardiness in filing the medical certification form.  On the other hand, the trier of fact reasonably could infer from Barbour's initial conversation with John Wilkinson, at which time Barbour was handed an undated medical certification form, that Wilkinson implicitly assured him that the ten-day provision would not be enforced against him.  Such an inference is strengthened by the December 15 statement Nickles made to Barbour, that though a certified letter had been sent to Barbour, he should not \"get shook.  We will work with you but keep in touch.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even after Barbour was notified that he had been terminated, he received decidedly mixed signals from DRC.  Although Nickles informed him that he had been terminated, her superior--Wilkinson--as late as December 31 held open the prospect that DRC would accept the medical form.  Not until January 10, 1988, when he finally received the misaddressed December 22, 1987, termination letter, and the January 7 letter informing him that the disability claim application would not be considered, was Barbour unambiguously informed of the consequences of failing to comply with the ten-day provision.  By then, of course, it was too late.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the bald statement in the December 22 termination letter that DRC had presumed--based on his failure to return the medical forms--that Barbour had voluntarily terminated his employment, notwithstanding his flat advice to the contrary on December 18, see supra p. 43, and his ongoing efforts to obtain medical certification at DRC's suggestion, imperatively bespeaks pretext and mendacity with sufficient clarity to demonstrate that the inferences relied on by DRC, and endorsed by the majority, are not compelled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since it cannot be demonstrated--without indulging impermissible inferences and credibility assessments--that a rational factfinder would be compelled to find that DRC did not actively encourage Barbour to take medical disability leave before obtaining medical certification, then lull him into the fateful belief that strict compliance with its ambivalent ten-day filing policy would not be enforced, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196019\"><a href=\"/opinion/196019/woodman-v-heamonetics-corp/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1094</a></span>-95 (prima facie case, combined with showing of pretext and suspicion of mendacity, precludes summary judgment on issue of intentional discrimination);  see generally, Hicks, --- U.S. at ----, ---- n. 4 &amp; <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">----,</span> <span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> at <span class=\"page\">2749</span></span>, 2749 n. 4 &amp; 2756 (where plaintiff adduces enough competent evidence to support inference of discrimination, the case must go to the trier of fact), I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The record does not indicate when and if this form was returned and neither party focuses on this document</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> DRC disputes this allegation and claims that Nickles told Barbour on two occasions that the Certification Form was due in the benefits office by December 18.  Even Barbour concedes that Nickles told him to return the form \"as early as possible.\"   Because this is a motion for summary judgment, however, we will review the facts in the light most favorable to Barbour</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> With respect to our dissenting brother, his characterization of this conversation is but one in a series of skewed presentations of the evidence that, taken together, he argues would permit a rational jury to conclude that DRC managers conspired to \"induce\" Barbour to take medical leave and \"lull\" him into believing there would be no consequences for failing to return the medical forms on time.  First, the dissent suggests that DRC had approved a \"medical disability leave\" when Barbour voluntarily began his absence from work on December 7.  Infra at 42.  Although DRC provided Barbour with the proper forms, the record contains no support for the inference that Barbour's absence beginning on that day was approved or induced by DRC.  Our brother finds further support for his conspiracy theory in the fact that on December 22, Barbour was \"told [by Wilkinson] to continue to seek medical certification.\"   Infra at 43.  Barbour's own notes, however, state that Wilkinson actually told him that he should \"keep going with the Dr. certificate and they would try to jump hurdles,\" and that \"we will see if we can salvage this thing.\"   Wilkinson's choice of words belies Barbour's assertion that DRC soft-pedaled the trouble he was in.  The assertion is further belied by Barbour's own notes of his conversation with Nickles on December 15, in which he recorded that Nickles told him that he should not \"get shook\" by the form letter she had sent him, and by Barbour's December 18 message for Nickles in which he told her that he did not want to terminate.  See infra at 42.  Why should Barbour \"get shook\" at all by a form letter unless he knew it contained some kind of ominous warning?   And, if Barbour had no idea that he was flirting with termination on December 18, why did he leave a message for Nickles stating that he did \"not want to terminate\"?   The particular inferences the dissent would permit the jury to draw from this (and other) evidence--that DRC lured an unwary Barbour into a bureaucratic trap--are patently unreasonable on this record</p>\n        <p>Similarly misleading is the dissent's suggestion that DRC's misaddressing of the December 10 letter to Barbour, and, in the dissent's underlined language, the fact that Nickles \"did [not] ask for Barbour's correct mailing address\" when she spoke to him on December 15, were evidence of nefarious doings.  Infra at 43 n. 5.  The December 10 letter was addressed to Barbour at \"P.O. Box 215, 88 Rogers.\"   He had apparently stopped using the postal box;  the street address, however, was correct.  One cannot rationally infer from this that Nickles intended that Barbour would not receive the letter;  the fact that Nickles put both addresses on the envelopes--with at least a reasonable probability that the postal service would direct the envelope to the correct address--is mighty strong evidence of mistake and not deliberation.  That Nickles failed to ask for Barbour's correct mailing address, simply in light of the fact that a letter sent a few day earlier had not arrived yet, is of even less evidentiary value;  it proves absolutely nothing.</p>\n        <p>To cite a final example of the dissent's indefensible inference-drawing, we are at a loss to understand what possible weight is added to Barbour's case by the statements of Wilkinson's secretary to Barbour on December 31.  Infra at 43.  The dissent cites this as a \"vicarious admission,\" but of what?   Even assuming that the secretary's statements concerned matters within the scope of her employment, what permissible negative inference could a rational jury draw from the fact that DRC \"evinced its readiness to receive the medical form\" even after Barbour had been formally terminated?   Whatever inferential leap our brother is making here escapes us.</p>\n        <p>Contrary to the dissent's characterization of our holding, we do not mean to imply that the total assemblage of evidence compels a particular conclusion;  rather, we hold that the conclusion that Barbour would have a rational jury draw--namely, that DRC set Barbour up to apply for medical leave so that it could fire him, and then lied about it--is impermissible based on this evidence.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In fact, DRC set forth five justifications for its decision to deny Barbour's disability claim:  (1) Dr. McCartin did not see Barbour until December 30, two weeks after the disability allegedly began;  (2) the condition listed on the form, \"hypertension,\" was different than the alcohol problem or bleeding condition which was expected given Barbour's previous statements to DRC supervisors;  (3) Barbour appeared to have been \"shopping around\" for a physician after Dr. Prescott refused to complete the form;  (4) the length of disability (undetermined) did not coincide with medical guidelines;  and (5) Barbour failed to keep his follow-up appointment with Dr. McCartin scheduled for January 7</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Although DRC had the correct street address, the letter had been addressed to a post office box (as well as a street address) which Barbour had relinquished sometime after he moved in 1984</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> On one other occasion, in early 1988, DRC warned an employee nineteen days after the ten-day period had elapsed.  Thus, the record supports a fair inference that the ten-day provision was being applied inconsistently or selectively at or about the time Barbour was terminated</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Notwithstanding its categorical notification to Barbour that the disability benefits application would not be considered, DRC now contends on appeal that it was considered and rejected on the basis of late submission and because the disability claim was based on hypertension, not alcoholism.   Should this belated representation be credited by the factfinder, it could buttress the inference that failure to file the form within ten days was not the true motive for terminating Barbour.  In these circumstances, Barbour need demonstrate no more at summary judgment.
