This appeal  arises out of  Dr.\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\nDiane Gibson's short and stormy stay as superintendent of schools\n\nin Cranston, Rhode  Island.   It stands as  a vivid  illustration\n\nthat some of life's  most instructive lessons are learned  in the\n\nclassroom  of adversity.    After educating  ourselves about  the\n\nfacts of the case, the applicable law, and the proceedings below,\n\nwe conclude that the district court correctly refused to give the\n\nplaintiff's case a passing grade.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Because the trial  court took this  case from the  jury\n\nand terminated it by means of an instructed verdict, we summarize\n\nthe   facts  adduced  below  in  the   light  most  congenial  to\n\nappellant's claims.\n\n          In    early   1989,   while    serving   as   Assistant\n\nSuperintendent of Schools  in Waterloo, Iowa, plaintiff-appellant\n\nDiane  Gibson  applied  for a  job  as  school superintendent  in\n\nCranston.   The school committee (the  Committee) interviewed her\n\ntwice (once  publicly and once privately)  and eventually offered\n\nher the post.  On  August 21, 1989, she met in Rhode  Island with\n\nmembers of the Committee  concerning her employment contract (the\n\nContract).  The parties signed it the next day.\n\n          The   Contract  contained  11  sections,  counting  the\n\npreamble, spread over eight pages.  It specified a term that  ran\n\nfrom October 1, 1989  to June 30, 1992.   The Contract  contained\n\nvarious  clauses  related to  professional  growth, compensation,\n\ncontract renewal, salary adjustments, termination for cause,  and\n\n                                2\n\nresignation.  It  also provided for  such miscellaneous items  as\n\ncertification,  annual  medical   examinations,  and   disability\n\nprotection.  Article  III described the superintendent's  duties,\n\nstating that she\n\n          shall be the chief administrator and agent of\n          the Cranston  schools and have charge  of the\n          administration  of  the  schools   under  the\n          direction of the Committee.  In this capacity\n          she  shall implement, among other things, all\n          policies approved by  the Committee,  provide\n          for  efficient  administration of  the system\n          and provide for the performance evaluation of\n          all administrators, teachers, and  quality of\n          the education provided.\n\nThe same  article stated that the parties' \"respective rights and\n\nresponsibilities .  . . shall  be as  specified in  Chapter 2  of\n\nTitle 16 of the [Rhode Island General Laws].\"\n\n          Article VI of the Contract has particular pertinence in\n\nthis  litigation.    By  its  terms,  the  article  obligated the\n\nCommittee  to  assess  in  writing  the  Superintendent's overall\n\nperformance  at least annually.  The format and procedure for the\n\nevaluation were to  be decided upon by the  parties no later than\n\n60  days after the Contract's effective date.  Once an evaluation\n\nemerged, the  Committee and the  Superintendent were to  meet for\n\ndiscussion  of it;  specifically, the  Contract indicated  that a\n\nmeeting  dedicated to this purpose would be held between February\n\n15 and March 15 of each contract year.  The evaluation  was to be\n\nused   in  determining  \"if  the  Superintendents's  Contract  is\n\nrenewed/not renewed.\"  To  this end, Article VI also  contained a\n\nnon-exclusive list of factors to be considered in  the evaluation\n\nprocess and required  that the end product describe in reasonable\n\n                                3\n\ndetail \"specific instances of strengths and commendations as well\n\nas specific instances of any unsatisfactory performance.\"\n\n          At the  end  of the  first 60  days of  her reign,  Dr.\n\nGibson had not  heard from the Committee regarding the evaluation\n\nprocess.   She  brought the  matter to  the attention  of Stephen\n\nDambruch,  the  Committee's chairman.    Dambruch suggested  that\n\nappellant develop and disseminate a proposed evaluation form.  On\n\nDecember 4, 1989, appellant complied.  On March 1, 1990, Dambruch\n\nnotified  the  Committee  that  an  evaluation  was  due  between\n\nFebruary  15  and March  15  of  each year.    Five  of the  nine\n\nCommittee members  responded on the form  appellant had prepared.\n\nTwo  other  members  wrote  letters  commenting  upon appellant's\n\nperformance.  Two Committee  members kept their own counsel.   In\n\nany  event, the  Committee never  composed a  unified performance\n\nevaluation.\n\n          This  lollygagging  took  place   during  a  period  of\n\nconsiderable turmoil.   In  January 1990 the  Committee voted  to\n\nrestructure the public schools, only to reverse itself two months\n\nlater.1   Spurred in part by this  dramatic about-face, appellant\n\nrequested that the Committee provide her with a written statement\n\nof  its goals.   Although  a  meeting was  held  to discuss  this\n\nrequest, the Committee never complied with it.\n\n          In March  1990 appellant  became aware that  the school\n\n                    \n\n     1To  add to  the muddle, hard  on the  heels of  the vote to\nrestructure  the school  system a  Committee member  circulated a\npoll  requesting   teachers'  input.     This  impulsive   action\nultimately led to the filing of an unfair labor practice charge.\n\n                                4\n\nsystem had improperly  paid health benefits  on behalf of  former\n\nemployees.  She brought this matter to the Committee's attention.\n\nDambruch and his colleagues commissioned an ad hoc committee (the\n\nAHC)  to mull the problem.   The AHC  sought to exclude appellant\n\nfrom  its  deliberations.    To  compound  this  contretemps,  an\n\nassistant  city  solicitor  wrote to  Dambruch  on  June  8, 1990\n\nsuggesting  that  the AHC  might be  illegally infringing  on the\n\nSuperintendent's  administrative prerogatives and  might lack the\n\nlegal authority necessary to  arrange for an audit of  the school\n\nsystem's records.  Eventually, the Committee retained a certified\n\npublic accountant.  Although the  accountant completed a study of\n\nthe situation, the Committee never provided appellant either with\n\nthe  accountant's  report  or  with any  feedback  regarding  the\n\naccountant's recommendations.\n\n          Cranston held a municipal election in November of 1990.\n\nThe  electoral results  significantly  affected  the  Committee's\n\ncomposition.   A member suggested that  appellant's evaluation be\n\ncompleted  before the  newly elected  members took  office.   The\n\nCommittee  scheduled  a special  meeting  for  this purpose,  but\n\nappellant  resigned before  the meeting  could be  held.   In her\n\nletter of resignation, dated December 28, 1990, appellant accused\n\nthe Committee of violating the Contract by not providing a proper\n\nevaluation and statement of goals, and by infringing on the scope\n\nof her autonomy as superintendent.\n\n          All was serene for well over a year.  On June 10, 1992,\n\nhowever,  appellant,  then  a   citizen  and  resident  of  North\n\n                                5\n\nCarolina, sued for  breach of  contract in a  Rhode Island  state\n\ncourt.  She claimed that the City of Cranston, acting through the\n\nCommittee, disregarded  duties owed  under the contract,  and she\n\nsought  damages including the balance  of her salary and benefits\n\nfor  the  period from  January 1,  1991  through June  30, 1992.2\n\nNoting the  existence of diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C.   1332\n\n(1988), Cranston removed the case to  federal district court, see\n                                                                 \n\n28 U.S.C.   1441 (1988).\n\n          In due course, Chief Judge Lagueux empaneled a jury and\n\ntrial  commenced.  At the close of the appellant's case, Cranston\n\nmoved  for a judgment  as a matter  of law.3   The district judge\n\nassumed arguendo that Cranston  had not fulfilled its contractual\n                \n\ncommitments, but ruled that, even so, the evidence did not permit\n\na rational jury to find a breach of  sufficient materiality as to\n\nallow appellant  to cease performance and recover damages for the\n\nbalance of the unexpired term.  This appeal followed.4\n\n                    \n\n     2Although Dr.  Gibson originally sued a  bevy of defendants,\nonly  Cranston and  its treasurer  remain in  the case.   Because\nRhode  Island  law  treats a  suit  against  the  treasurer of  a\nmunicipality,  in his or her official capacity, as a suit against\nthe  city, see  R.I.  Gen.  Laws     45-15-5  (1991),  these  two\n              \ndefendants are  in effect  the  same entity.   We  refer to  them\ncollectively as \"Cranston.\"\n\n     3In  1991, Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 50  was amended  to change  the\nappellation \"directed verdict\"  to \"judgment as a matter of law.\"\nThis  change in nomenclature does not affect the substance of the\napplicable legal standard.\n\n     4Although we affirm  the grant  of judgment as  a matter  of\nlaw, see  infra, we caution that in most cases a trial court will\n               \nbe better advised to  reserve decision on such a  motion, passing\non the legal question only after submitting the case to the jury.\nMid-trial  directed verdicts  should  be the  exception, not  the\nrule.   We  concluded long  ago that  refraining from  granting a\n\n                                6\n\nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n          When confronted with a motion  for judgment as a matter\n\nof law, whether at the end of a plaintiff's case or  at the close\n\nof  all the evidence, a trial court must scrutinize the proof and\n\nthe inferences reasonably to be drawn therefrom in the light most\n\namiable to  the nonmovant.  See Rolon-Alvarado v. Municipality of\n                                                                 \n\nSan Juan, 1 F.3d 74, 76 (1st Cir. 1993); Wagenmann  v. Adams, 829\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir. 1987).  In the process, the court may not\n\nconsider  the  credibility  of witnesses,  resolve  conflicts  in\n\ntestimony, or evaluate  the weight of  evidence.  See  Wagenmann,\n                                                                \n\n829 F.2d at 200.   A judgment as a  matter of law may be  granted\n\nonly if the evidence, viewed from the perspective  most favorable\n\nto  the nonmovant,  is so  one-sided that  the movant  is plainly\n\nentitled to judgment, for reasonable minds could not differ as to\n\nthe outcome.  See Rolon-Alvarado, 1 F.3d at 77.\n                                \n\n          Because granting a judgment as a  matter of law depends\n\nupon the legal  sufficiency of the evidence, appellate  review is\n\nplenary.   See Jordan-Milton Mach., Inc. v. F/V Teresa Marie, II,\n                                                                \n\n978 F.2d  32, 34 (1st Cir. 1992).  It is incumbent upon the court\n\nof appeals  to apply precisely  the same criteria  that constrain\n\nthe trial court.   See Rolon-Alvarado, 1  F.3d at 77.   Moreover,\n                                     \n\n                    \n\njudgment as a  matter of law until  the jury has had a  chance to\ndeal  with the  merits  is  frequently  a \"wise  and  time-saving\nprecaution.\"   Talbot-Windsor  Corp. v.  Miller, 309 F.2d  68, 69\n                                               \n(1st Cir. 1962).   By following that course, the  judge minimizes\nthe risk that the trial will have to be replayed  yet retains the\npower  to pass  on the sufficiency  of the  evidence in  a timely\nmanner.   Of course,  everything depends upon  the circumstances,\nand in some cases granting the motion is both efficient and wise.\n\n                                7\n\nthe standard of review affords no place for any deference to  the\n\ndistrict  court's  view anent  state-law  questions.   See  Salve\n                                                                 \n\nRegina Coll. v. Russell, 499 U.S. 225, 238 (1991).\n                       \n\nIII.  ANALYSIS\n\n          The  substantive law  of Rhode  Island governs  in this\n\ndiversity  case.  Under Rhode Island law, a contracting party may\n\ncease performance and seek damages if the other contracting party\n\ncommits  a breach that is \"material,\" see, e.g.,Philip Carey Mfg.\n                                                                 \n\nCo. v. General Prods. Co., 151 A.2d 487, 493 (R.I. 1959), or that\n                         \n\n\"goes  to the essence of  the contract,\" Aiello  Constr., Inc. v.\n                                                              \n\nNationwide Tractor  Trailer Training &amp; Placement  Corp., 413 A.2d\n                                                       \n\n85, 87 (R.I.  1980).  Some courts and  commentators have cast the\n\nstandard  in terms of a \"total\" breach  as opposed to a \"partial\"\n\nbreach,  with  only  the   former  justifying  termination  of  a\n\ncontract.   See, e.g., Lovink  v. Guilford Mills,  Inc., 878 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n584, 586-87 (2d Cir. 1989); Arthur L. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts\n                                                                 \n\n  946, at 809 (1951).  Because we believe  these terms constitute\n\nvarious  ways  of  saying  the  same  thing,  we  will  use  them\n\ninterchangeably.5\n\n                    \n\n     5The rigid material/non-material dichotomy  may oversimplify\nthe universe of  breaches.   Although this case,  in its  present\nposture, does not require  us to make a finer distinction,  we do\nnot deprecate the  possibility that there may  be an intermediate\nlevel of breach, i.e.,  breaches which are not serious  enough to\n                     \nwarrant repudiation of the contract and a suit for damages by the\ninjured party,  but which nonetheless might  constitute a defense\nto  an action  for damages  brought by  the party  committing the\ninitial breach.  Thus,  our holding that the  Committee's alleged\nbreaches  were  not material,  see  infra,  does not  necessarily\n                                         \nbetoken  that Dr. Gibson would have been liable had the Committee\nsued her for breach.\n\n                                8\n\n          Appellant invites us to rule that materiality is always\n\na  question of  fact, thereby  eliminating the  possibility of  a\n\ndirected  verdict  where, as  here, the  issue  is disputed.   We\n\ndecline the  invitation.    While the  state  supreme  court  has\n\nindicated that, in this context,  materiality  \"is essentially  a\n\nfactual question,\" and  that its resolution  ordinarily \"requires\n\nconsideration of all the  pertinent evidence and the  conduct and\n\nrelationship of the parties,\" Dunne Leases Cars &amp; Trucks, Inc. v.\n                                                              \n\nKenworth  Truck Co., 466 A.2d  1153, 1160 (R.I.  1983), the first\n                   \n\npart  of this  statement  is  a  generalization, and,  like  most\n\ngeneralizations, it  admits of  exceptions.  Though  questions of\n\nmateriality are usually to be determined by the trier of fact, in\n\nthis case  the jury, the  rule is not universal.   As is  true of\n\nvirtually any factual question, if the materiality  question in a\n\ngiven case  admits of  only one  reasonable  answer (because  the\n\nevidence  on  the  point  is either  undisputed  or  sufficiently\n\nlopsided),  then the  court must  intervene  and address  what is\n\nordinarily a factual question as a question of law.\n\n          The task  of delineating which  particular breaches may\n\njustify  an injured  party  ceasing performance  and bringing  an\n\naction  for damages is demanding,  but the case  law affords some\n\ninsights.   In Aiello, for  example, the plaintiff, a contractor,\n                     \n\nsued  a property owner for nonpayment of installments due under a\n\nconstruction contract.  The  Rhode Island Supreme Court upheld  a\n\nfinding that the defendant's failure to  pay installments as they\n\ncame  due went  to the  essence of  the contract  and, therefore,\n\n                                9\n\nexcused further performance  by the plaintiff.   See Aiello,  413\n                                                           \n\nA.2d at 87.   In Dunne, the court upheld a finding  that a dealer\n                      \n\ncommitted a  material breach of  its franchise  agreement with  a\n\ntruck manufacturer by  failing to honor  its promise to  separate\n\nits leasing activities from its dealership operation.

In  its opinion,  the court  emphasized the\n\npresence  of  evidence  that  the  leasing  activities  adversely\n\nimpacted  the   truck  dealership   in  the  areas   of  parking,\n\ncleanliness, parts sales, and service.  See id. at 1158.  On this\n                                               \n\nbasis, the  court concluded  that  the dealer's  breach might  be\n\ndeemed  material even  though the  dealer regularly  achieved its\n\nsales quota under the franchise agreement.6  See id. at 1159.\n                                                    \n\n          Despite  the insights  that can  be gleaned  from these\n\ncases,  the  Rhode  Island  courts thus  far  have  not precisely\n\ndefined  what constitutes  a  material breach.   Nonetheless,  we\n\nbelieve  that   the  proper  analysis  is   informed  by  certain\n\ncommentaries  and  decisions  from  outside Rhode  Island.

The  Restatement  is  an\n\nespecially helpful source of guidance because Rhode Island courts\n\nfrequently turn to  the Restatement  to fill gaps  in state  law.\n\nSee,  e.g.,  Bibby's  Refrig.,  Heating  &amp;   Air  Cond.  Inc.  v.\n                                                             \n\nSalisbury,  603 A.2d 726,  729 (1992); Durapin,  Inc. v.

The Restatement lists\n            \n\nfive factors  that may  be  considered in  determining whether  a\n\nbreach is  material.7  Other commentators  have espoused slightly\n\n                    \n\n     7These factors are:\n\n          (a)  the  extent to  which the  injured party\n          will  be  deprived  of the  benefit  which he\n          reasonably expected;\n          (b) the extent to which the injured party can\n          be adequately  compensated  for the  part  of\n          that benefit of which he will be deprived;\n          (c) the extent to  which the party failing to\n          perform  or  offer  to  perform  will  suffer\n          forfeiture;\n           (d) the likelihood that the party failing to\n          perform or to offer  to perform will cure his\n          failure,   taking   account   of    all   the\n          circumstances   including    any   reasonable\n          assurances;\n          (e) the  extent to which the  behavior of the\n          party  failing to  perform  or  to  offer  to\n          perform comports with standards of good faith\n          and fair dealing.\n\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts   241 (1979).\n\n                                11\n\ndifferent  sets  of  relevant  factors  for  use  in  determining\n\nmateriality,  such as the extent  to which the  contract has been\n\nperformed at the time of  the breach, the willfulness vel non  of\n                                                             \n\nthe breach,  and the  degree of  seriousness attributable to  the\n\nbreach,  expressed  in  quantitative  terms.    See  2  E.  Allan\n                                                   \n\nFarnsworth,  Farnsworth On  Contracts    8.16, at 442  (1990); J.\n                                     \n\nCalamari  &amp; J.  Perillo,  Contracts 408-09  (2d  ed. 1977).    We\n                                   \n\nbelieve that when  the occasion arises, the Rhode  Island Supreme\n\nCourt will adopt  some variant  of these tests  to determine  the\n\nmateriality  of a  breach of  contract.8   In our view,  the test\n\nwill  concentrate  on  factors  such   as  those  listed  in  the\n\nRestatement, with special emphasis, in the employment context, on\n\nthe extent to which the alleged breach interferes with the duties\n\nand benefits flowing from the contract in its  entirety.  We need\n\nnot dice matters too  finely, however, for appellant's proof  can\n\nmeet neither the Restatement  standard nor any reasonable variant\n\nof it.  We explain briefly.\n\n          While a material breach  of an employment contract need\n\nnot completely  frustrate the entire purpose of  the contract, it\n\nmust be so important  that it makes continued performance  by the\n\nplaintiff  virtually  pointless, see  Lovink,  878  F.2d at  587.\n                                            \n\nThus, if Cranston  refused to pay  appellant, or, conversely,  if\n\n                    \n\n     8Appellant suggests that \"a breach is  material if it denies\na  party a  bargained-for  exchange.\"   We find  this formulation\nunacceptable,  for it does not reflect how significant a contract\nprovision must be before its breach will be deemed material.\n\n                                12\n\nappellant completely  withheld her services for  no valid reason,\n\nthe ensuing breach would reach the essence of the Contract.\n\n          But that is not what  transpired here.  We think it  is\n\nreadily apparent that, under the stringent standard that obtains,\n\nthe Committee's alleged breaches of the Contract are, as a matter\n\nof  law, not  material.   The superintendent's job  encompasses a\n\ncomplex and varied set of responsibilities.  Under a provision of\n\nthe Rhode  Island General  Laws, which is  incorporated into  the\n\nContract by explicit reference, the post includes a vast array of\n\nadministrative,   supervisory,   managerial,   and   policymaking\n\nfunctions.  See  R. I. Gen. Laws    16-2-11 (1988), reprinted  in\n               \n\nthe  appendix.   This  elaborate compendium  of responsibilities,\n\ncomplemented by  the  multifarious  provisions  of  the  Contract\n\nitself, put appellant's grievances  into proper perspective.  And\n\nso viewed, we are unable to  see how a reasonable jury could find\n\nthat  the  Committee's  conduct involved  matters  of  sufficient\n\nsignificance to constitute a material breach.\n\n          Appellant's  flagship  claim   pirouettes  around   the\n\nCommittee's  failure to  provide her  with a  unified evaluation.\n\nGiven  the  admitted  feedback  that appellant  received  from  a\n\nmajority of  the individual Committee members,  we cannot discern\n\nhow the failure to reduce the feedback to a unified evaluation or\n\nthe other shortcomings in the evaluation process  could be deemed\n\na material breach.   Without the evaluation, appellant was  still\n\nable to carry  out virtually  all of her  responsibilities.   She\n\nstill received the overwhelming majority of the benefits to which\n\n                                13\n\nthe Contract entitled her.   Her mere testimony that  without the\n\nevaluation  provision she  would not  have signed  the employment\n\nagreement cannot make this otherwise  unremarkable provision into\n\none that \"goes to the essence of the contract.\"  Salo Landscape &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nConstr.

Palandjian, 809\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  938,  945 (1st  Cir.  1987)  (commenting that  \"contracting\n\nparties are  bound by  objective manifestations  and expressions,\n\nnot subjective expectations\").   In other  words, a party  cannot\n\ntransmogrify a provision that,  from an objective standpoint, has\n\nonly marginal  significance into one  of central salience  by the\n\nsimple  expedient of saying in retrospect that she believed it to\n\nbe very important.\n\n          Here,    notwithstanding     plaintiff's    post    hoc\n                                                                 \n\nrationalization,  the Committee's  failure to  provide a  unified\n\nevaluation  seems much more a  matter of form  than of substance.\n\nIt did not in  any way shrink plaintiff's major duties or deprive\n\nher  of  the  principal  benefits  of  her  contractual  bargain.\n\nNothing  about the failure betokens bad faith or an unfair course\n\n                                14\n\nof conduct.  And the sockdolager is that, at the  time Dr. Gibson\n\nresigned, there  was a high  likelihood that the  Committee would\n\nsoon cure  its  breach  by  providing an  evaluation;  a  special\n\nmeeting for this  purpose was  scheduled to occur  less than  one\n\nweek after she precipitously resigned.\n\n          Appellant's  fallback position  is  that the  Committee\n\nnever  furnished  her with  a written  statement  of goals.   But\n\nappellant had ample contact with the Committee and its members to\n\nget a sense of the school system's objectives.  Thus, as with the\n\nfirst   alleged   breach,   this   failure  did   not   interfere\n\nsignificantly with  either her duties  or her benefits  under the\n\nContract.   Consequently,  it  could  not be  deemed  a  material\n\nbreach.\n\n          Finally, appellant alleges that the Committee infringed\n\nupon  her  administrative  responsibilities.     She  offers  two\n\nincidents  to illustrate  her contention:   a  Committee member's\n\naction  in sending a  questionnaire directly to  the faculty, see\n                                                                 \n\nsupra  note 1,  and the  AHC's attempt  to  exclude her  from its\n     \n\ndeliberations.    Given  the   minor  nature  of  these  supposed\n\ninfractions and their  subsequent resolution, no  reasonable jury\n\ncould find that they constitute a material breach.\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We need go no further.  Considering all the evidence in\n\nthe light  most hospitable to plaintiff, no reasonable jury could\n\nfind that the Committee's alleged breaches of the Contract gutted\n\nit.   Consequently,  the  court below  did  not err  in  granting\n\n                                15\n\njudgment as a matter of law.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                16\n",

It stands as a vivid illustration that some of life's most instructive lessons are learned in the classroom of adversity.  After educating ourselves about the facts of the case, the applicable law, and the proceedings below, we conclude that the district court correctly refused to give the plaintiff's case a passing grade.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the trial court took this case from the jury and terminated it by means of an instructed verdict, we summarize the facts adduced below in the light most congenial to appellant's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1989, while serving as Assistant Superintendent of Schools in Waterloo, Iowa, plaintiff-appellant Diane Gibson applied for a job as school superintendent in Cranston.  The school committee (the Committee) interviewed her twice (once publicly and once privately) and eventually offered her the post.  On August 21, 1989, she met in Rhode Island with members of the Committee concerning her employment contract (the Contract).  The parties signed it the next day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Contract contained 11 sections, counting the preamble, spread over eight pages.  It specified a term that ran from October 1, 1989 to June 30, 1992.  The Contract contained various clauses related to professional growth, compensation, contract renewal, salary adjustments, termination for cause, and resignation.  It also provided for such miscellaneous items as certification, annual medical examinations, and disability protection.  Article III described the superintendent's duties, stating that she</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>shall be the chief administrator and agent of the Cranston schools and have charge of the administration of the schools under the direction of the Committee.  In this capacity she shall implement, among other things, all policies approved by the Committee, provide for efficient administration of the system and provide for the performance evaluation of all administrators, teachers, and quality of the education provided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same article stated that the parties' \"respective rights and responsibilities ... shall be as specified in Chapter 2 of Title 16 of the [Rhode Island General Laws].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article VI of the Contract has particular pertinence in this litigation.  By its terms, the article obligated the Committee to assess in writing the Superintendent's overall performance at least annually.  The format and procedure for the evaluation were to be decided upon by the parties no later than 60 days after the Contract's effective date.  Once an evaluation emerged, the Committee and the Superintendent were to meet for discussion of it;  specifically, the Contract indicated that a meeting dedicated to this purpose would be held between February 15 and March 15 of each contract year.  The evaluation was to be used in determining \"if the Superintendents's Contract is renewed/not renewed.\"   To this end, Article VI also contained a non-exclusive list of factors to be considered in the evaluation process and required that the end product describe in reasonable detail \"specific instances of strengths and commendations as well as specific instances of any unsatisfactory performance.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of the first 60 days of her reign, Dr. Gibson had not heard from the Committee regarding the evaluation process.  She brought the matter to the attention of Stephen Dambruch, the Committee's chairman.  Dambruch suggested that appellant develop and disseminate a proposed evaluation form.  On December 4, 1989, appellant complied.  On March 1, 1990, Dambruch notified the Committee that an evaluation was due between February 15 and March 15 of each year.  Five of the nine Committee members responded on the form appellant had prepared.  Two other members wrote letters commenting upon appellant's performance.  Two Committee members kept their own counsel.  In any event, the Committee never composed a unified performance evaluation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This lollygagging took place during a period of considerable turmoil.  In January 1990 the Committee voted to restructure the public schools, only to reverse itself two months later.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Spurred in part by this dramatic about-face, appellant requested that the Committee provide her with a written statement of its goals.  Although a meeting was held to discuss this request, the Committee never complied with it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1990 appellant became aware that the school system had improperly paid health benefits on behalf of former employees.  She brought this matter to the Committee's attention.  Dambruch and his colleagues commissioned an ad hoc committee (the AHC) to mull the problem.  The AHC sought to exclude appellant from its deliberations.  To compound this contretemps, an assistant city solicitor wrote to Dambruch on June 8, 1990 suggesting that the AHC might be illegally infringing on the Superintendent's administrative prerogatives and might lack the legal authority necessary to arrange for an audit of the school system's records.  Eventually, the Committee retained a certified public accountant.  Although the accountant completed a study of the situation, the Committee never provided appellant either with the accountant's report or with any feedback regarding the accountant's recommendations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cranston held a municipal election in November of 1990.  The electoral results significantly affected the Committee's composition.  A member suggested that appellant's evaluation be completed before the newly elected members took office.  The Committee scheduled a special meeting for this purpose, but appellant resigned before the meeting could be held.  In her letter of resignation, dated December 28, 1990, appellant accused the Committee of violating the Contract by not providing a proper evaluation and statement of goals, and by infringing on the scope of her autonomy as superintendent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All was serene for well over a year.  On June 10, 1992, however, appellant, then a citizen and resident of North Carolina, sued for breach of contract in a Rhode Island state court.  She claimed that the City of Cranston, acting through the Committee, disregarded duties owed under the contract, and she sought damages including the balance of her salary and benefits for the period from January 1, 1991 through June 30, 1992.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Noting the existence of diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332 (1988), Cranston removed the case to federal district court, see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1441 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Chief Judge Lagueux empaneled a jury and trial commenced.  At the close of the appellant's case, Cranston moved for a judgment as a matter of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The district judge assumed arguendo that Cranston had not fulfilled its contractual commitments, but ruled that, even so, the evidence did not permit a rational jury to find a breach of sufficient materiality as to allow appellant to cease performance and recover damages for the balance of the unexpired term.  This appeal followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When confronted with a motion for judgment as a matter of law, whether at the end of a plaintiff's case or at the close of all the evidence, a trial court must scrutinize the proof and the inferences reasonably to be drawn therefrom in the light most amiable to the nonmovant.  See Rolon-Alvarado v. Municipality of San Juan, 1 F.3d 74, 76 (1st Cir.1993);  Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir.1987).  In the process, the court may not consider the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of evidence.  See Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 200.   A judgment as a matter of law may be granted only if the evidence, viewed from the perspective most favorable to the nonmovant, is so one-sided that the movant is plainly entitled to judgment, for reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome.  See Rolon-Alvarado, 1 F.3d at 77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because granting a judgment as a matter of law depends upon the legal sufficiency of the evidence, appellate review is plenary.  See Jordan-Milton Mach., Inc. v. F/V Teresa Marie, II, 978 F.2d 32, 34 (1st Cir.1992).  It is incumbent upon the court of appeals to apply precisely the same criteria that constrain the trial court.  See Rolon-Alvarado, 1 F.3d at 77.   Moreover, the standard of review affords no place for any deference to the district court's view anent state-law questions.  See Salve Regina Coll. v. Russell, 499 U.S. 225, 238, 111 S.Ct. 1217, 1224-25, 113 L.Ed.2d 190 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The substantive law of Rhode Island governs in this diversity case.  Under Rhode Island law, a contracting party may cease performance and seek damages if the other contracting party commits a breach that is \"material,\" see, e.g., Philip Carey Mfg. Co. v. General Prods.  Co., 89 R.I. 136, 151 A.2d 487, 493 (1959), or that \"goes to the essence of the contract,\" Aiello Constr., Inc. v. Nationwide Tractor Trailer Training &amp; Placement Corp., 122 R.I. 861, 413 A.2d 85, 87 (1980).  Some courts and commentators have cast the standard in terms of a \"total\" breach as opposed to a \"partial\" breach, with only the former justifying termination of a contract.  See, e.g., Lovink v. Guilford Mills, Inc., 878 F.2d 584, 586-87 (2d Cir.1989);  Arthur L. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts Sec. 946, at 809 (1951).  Because we believe these terms constitute various ways of saying the same thing, we will use them interchangeably.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant invites us to rule that materiality is always a question of fact, thereby eliminating the possibility of a directed verdict where, as here, the issue is disputed.  We decline the invitation.  While the state supreme court has indicated that, in this context, materiality \"is essentially a factual question,\" and that its resolution ordinarily \"requires consideration of all the pertinent evidence and the conduct and relationship of the parties,\" Dunne Leases Cars &amp; Trucks, Inc. v. Kenworth Truck Co., 466 A.2d 1153, 1160 (R.I.1983), the first part of this statement is a generalization, and, like most generalizations, it admits of exceptions.  Though questions of materiality are usually to be determined by the trier of fact, in this case the jury, the rule is not universal.  As is true of virtually any factual question, if the materiality question in a given case admits of only one reasonable answer (because the evidence on the point is either undisputed or sufficiently lopsided), then the court must intervene and address what is ordinarily a factual question as a question of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The task of delineating which particular breaches may justify an injured party ceasing performance and bringing an action for damages is demanding, but the case law affords some insights.  In Aiello, for example, the plaintiff, a contractor, sued a property owner for nonpayment of installments due under a construction contract.  The Rhode Island Supreme Court upheld a finding that the defendant's failure to pay installments as they came due went to the essence of the contract and, therefore, excused further performance by the plaintiff.  See Aiello, 413 A.2d at 87.   In Dunne, the court upheld a finding that a dealer committed a material breach of its franchise agreement with a truck manufacturer by failing to honor its promise to separate its leasing activities from its dealership operation.  See Dunne, 466 A.2d at 1159.   In its opinion, the court emphasized the presence of evidence that the leasing activities adversely impacted the truck dealership in the areas of parking, cleanliness, parts sales, and service.  See id. at 1158.   On this basis, the court concluded that the dealer's breach might be deemed material even though the dealer regularly achieved its sales quota under the franchise agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See id. at 1159.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the insights that can be gleaned from these cases, the Rhode Island courts thus far have not precisely defined what constitutes a material breach.  Nonetheless, we believe that the proper analysis is informed by certain commentaries and decisions from outside Rhode Island.  See Michelin Tires (Canada), Ltd. v. First Nat'l Bank, 666 F.2d 673, 682 (1st Cir.1981) (\"In the absence of a definitive ruling by the highest state court, a federal court may consider analogous decisions, considered dicta, scholarly works, and any other reliable data tending convincingly to show how the highest court in the state would decide the issue at hand, taking into account the broad policies and trends so evinced.\")  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  The Restatement is an especially helpful source of guidance because Rhode Island courts frequently turn to the Restatement to fill gaps in state law.  See, e.g., Bibby's Refrig., Heating &amp; Air Cond.  Inc. v. Salisbury, 603 A.2d 726, 729 (1992);  Durapin, Inc. v. American Prods., Inc., 559 A.2d 1051, 1059 (1989).  The Restatement lists five factors that may be considered in determining whether a breach is material.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Other commentators have espoused slightly different sets of relevant factors for use in determining materiality, such as the extent to which the contract has been performed at the time of the breach, the willfulness vel non of the breach, and the degree of seriousness attributable to the breach, expressed in quantitative terms.  See 2 E. Allan Farnsworth, Farnsworth On Contracts Sec. 8.16, at 442 (1990);  J. Calamari &amp; J. Perillo, Contracts 408-09 (2d ed. 1977).  We believe that when the occasion arises, the Rhode Island Supreme Court will adopt some variant of these tests to determine the materiality of a breach of contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  In our view, the test will concentrate on factors such as those listed in the Restatement, with special emphasis, in the employment context, on the extent to which the alleged breach interferes with the duties and benefits flowing from the contract in its entirety.  We need not dice matters too finely, however, for appellant's proof can meet neither the Restatement standard nor any reasonable variant of it.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While a material breach of an employment contract need not completely frustrate the entire purpose of the contract, it must be so important that it makes continued performance by the plaintiff virtually pointless, see Lovink, 878 F.2d at 587.   Thus, if Cranston refused to pay appellant, or, conversely, if appellant completely withheld her services for no valid reason, the ensuing breach would reach the essence of the Contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But that is not what transpired here.  We think it is readily apparent that, under the stringent standard that obtains, the Committee's alleged breaches of the Contract are, as a matter of law, not material.  The superintendent's job encompasses a complex and varied set of responsibilities.  Under a provision of the Rhode Island General Laws, which is incorporated into the Contract by explicit reference, the post includes a vast array of administrative, supervisory, managerial, and policymaking functions.  See R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 16-2-11 (1988), reprinted in the appendix.  This elaborate compendium of responsibilities, complemented by the multifarious provisions of the Contract itself, put appellant's grievances into proper perspective.  And so viewed, we are unable to see how a reasonable jury could find that the Committee's conduct involved matters of sufficient significance to constitute a material breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's flagship claim pirouettes around the Committee's failure to provide her with a unified evaluation.  Given the admitted feedback that appellant received from a majority of the individual Committee members, we cannot discern how the failure to reduce the feedback to a unified evaluation or the other shortcomings in the evaluation process could be deemed a material breach.  Without the evaluation, appellant was still able to carry out virtually all of her responsibilities.  She still received the overwhelming majority of the benefits to which the Contract entitled her.  Her mere testimony that without the evaluation provision she would not have signed the employment agreement cannot make this otherwise unremarkable provision into one that \"goes to the essence of the contract.\"  Salo Landscape &amp; Constr.  Co. v. Liberty Elec. Co., 119 R.I. 269, 376 A.2d 1379, 1382 (1977).  The determination of materiality, like other aspects of contract interpretation, must be based largely on a standard of objective reasonableness rather than purely subjective belief.  Cf. John F. Davis Co. v. Shepard Co., 71 R.I. 499, 47 A.2d 635, 637 (1946) (noting that the \"true question\" in determining the intention of the parties is \"not what intention existed in the minds of the parties, but what intention is expressed by the language used\") (internal quotation marks omitted);  Pahlavi v. Palandjian, 809 F.2d 938, 945 (1st Cir.1987) (commenting that \"contracting parties are bound by objective manifestations and expressions, not subjective expectations\").  In other words, a party cannot transmogrify a provision that, from an objective standpoint, has only marginal significance into one of central salience by the simple expedient of saying in retrospect that she believed it to be very important.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, notwithstanding plaintiff's post hoc rationalization, the Committee's failure to provide a unified evaluation seems much more a matter of form than of substance.  It did not in any way shrink plaintiff's major duties or deprive her of the principal benefits of her contractual bargain.  Nothing about the failure betokens bad faith or an unfair course of conduct.  And the sockdolager is that, at the time Dr. Gibson resigned, there was a high likelihood that the Committee would soon cure its breach by providing an evaluation;  a special meeting for this purpose was scheduled to occur less than one week after she precipitously resigned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's fallback position is that the Committee never furnished her with a written statement of goals.  But appellant had ample contact with the Committee and its members to get a sense of the school system's objectives.  Thus, as with the first alleged breach, this failure did not interfere significantly with either her duties or her benefits under the Contract.  Consequently, it could not be deemed a material breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant alleges that the Committee infringed upon her administrative responsibilities.  She offers two incidents to illustrate her contention:  a Committee member's action in sending a questionnaire directly to the faculty, see supra note 1, and the AHC's attempt to exclude her from its deliberations.  Given the minor nature of these supposed infractions and their subsequent resolution, no reasonable jury could find that they constitute a material breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Considering all the evidence in the light most hospitable to plaintiff, no reasonable jury could find that the Committee's alleged breaches of the Contract gutted it.  Consequently, the court below did not err in granting judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">16-2-11.

Because Rhode Island law treats a suit against the treasurer of a municipality, in his or her official capacity, as a suit against the city, see R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 45-15-5 (1991), these two defendants are in effect the same entity.  We refer to them collectively as \"Cranston.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In 1991, Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 was amended to change the appellation \"directed verdict\" to \"judgment as a matter of law.\"   This change in nomenclature does not affect the substance of the applicable legal standard</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Although we affirm the grant of judgment as a matter of law, see infra, we caution that in most cases a trial court will be better advised to reserve decision on such a motion, passing on the legal question only after submitting the case to the jury.  Mid-trial directed verdicts should be the exception, not the rule.  We concluded long ago that refraining from granting a judgment as a matter of law until the jury has had a chance to deal with the merits is frequently a \"wise and time-saving precaution.\"  Talbot-Windsor Corp. v. Miller, 309 F.2d 68, 69 (1st Cir.1962).  By following that course, the judge minimizes the risk that the trial will have to be replayed yet retains the power to pass on the sufficiency of the evidence in a timely manner.  Of course, everything depends upon the circumstances, and in some cases granting the motion is both efficient and wise</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The rigid material/non-material dichotomy may oversimplify the universe of breaches.  Although this case, in its present posture, does not require us to make a finer distinction, we do not deprecate the possibility that there may be an intermediate level of breach, i.e., breaches which are not serious enough to warrant repudiation of the contract and a suit for damages by the injured party, but which nonetheless might constitute a defense to an action for damages brought by the party committing the initial breach.  Thus, our holding that the Committee's alleged breaches were not material, see infra, does not necessarily betoken that Dr. Gibson would have been liable had the Committee sued her for breach</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Although Dunne involved allegations that the defendant's decision to terminate the franchise agreement had been reached without \"due cause\" as then required by R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 31-5.1-4(C)(3) (1979 reenactment), the Rhode Island Supreme Court interpreted \"due cause\" as turning on the materiality of certain breaches committed by the franchisee.

It stands as a vivid illustration that some of life's most instructive lessons are learned in the classroom of adversity.  After educating ourselves about the facts of the case, the applicable law, and the proceedings below, we conclude that the district court correctly refused to give the plaintiff's case a passing grade.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the trial court took this case from the jury and terminated it by means of an instructed verdict, we summarize the facts adduced below in the light most congenial to appellant's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1989, while serving as Assistant Superintendent of Schools in Waterloo, Iowa, plaintiff-appellant Diane Gibson applied for a job as school superintendent in Cranston.  The school committee (the Committee) interviewed her twice (once publicly and once privately) and eventually offered her the post.  On August 21, 1989, she met in Rhode Island with members of the Committee concerning her employment contract (the Contract).  The parties signed it the next day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Contract contained 11 sections, counting the preamble, spread over eight pages.  It specified a term that ran from October 1, 1989 to June 30, 1992.  The Contract contained various clauses related to professional growth, compensation, contract renewal, salary adjustments, termination for cause, and resignation.  It also provided for such miscellaneous items as certification, annual medical examinations, and disability protection.  Article III described the superintendent's duties, stating that she</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>shall be the chief administrator and agent of the Cranston schools and have charge of the administration of the schools under the direction of the Committee.  In this capacity she shall implement, among other things, all policies approved by the Committee, provide for efficient administration of the system and provide for the performance evaluation of all administrators, teachers, and quality of the education provided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same article stated that the parties' \"respective rights and responsibilities ... shall be as specified in Chapter 2 of Title 16 of the [Rhode Island General Laws].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article VI of the Contract has particular pertinence in this litigation.  By its terms, the article obligated the Committee to assess in writing the Superintendent's overall performance at least annually.  The format and procedure for the evaluation were to be decided upon by the parties no later than 60 days after the Contract's effective date.  Once an evaluation emerged, the Committee and the Superintendent were to meet for discussion of it;  specifically, the Contract indicated that a meeting dedicated to this purpose would be held between February 15 and March 15 of each contract year.  The evaluation was to be used in determining \"if the Superintendents's Contract is renewed/not renewed.\"   To this end, Article VI also contained a non-exclusive list of factors to be considered in the evaluation process and required that the end product describe in reasonable detail \"specific instances of strengths and commendations as well as specific instances of any unsatisfactory performance.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of the first 60 days of her reign, Dr. Gibson had not heard from the Committee regarding the evaluation process.  She brought the matter to the attention of Stephen Dambruch, the Committee's chairman.  Dambruch suggested that appellant develop and disseminate a proposed evaluation form.  On December 4, 1989, appellant complied.  On March 1, 1990, Dambruch notified the Committee that an evaluation was due between February 15 and March 15 of each year.  Five of the nine Committee members responded on the form appellant had prepared.  Two other members wrote letters commenting upon appellant's performance.  Two Committee members kept their own counsel.  In any event, the Committee never composed a unified performance evaluation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This lollygagging took place during a period of considerable turmoil.  In January 1990 the Committee voted to restructure the public schools, only to reverse itself two months later.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Spurred in part by this dramatic about-face, appellant requested that the Committee provide her with a written statement of its goals.  Although a meeting was held to discuss this request, the Committee never complied with it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1990 appellant became aware that the school system had improperly paid health benefits on behalf of former employees.  She brought this matter to the Committee's attention.  Dambruch and his colleagues commissioned an ad hoc committee (the AHC) to mull the problem.  The AHC sought to exclude appellant from its deliberations.  To compound this contretemps, an assistant city solicitor wrote to Dambruch on June 8, 1990 suggesting that the AHC might be illegally infringing on the Superintendent's administrative prerogatives and might lack the legal authority necessary to arrange for an audit of the school system's records.  Eventually, the Committee retained a certified public accountant.  Although the accountant completed a study of the situation, the Committee never provided appellant either with the accountant's report or with any feedback regarding the accountant's recommendations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cranston held a municipal election in November of 1990.  The electoral results significantly affected the Committee's composition.  A member suggested that appellant's evaluation be completed before the newly elected members took office.  The Committee scheduled a special meeting for this purpose, but appellant resigned before the meeting could be held.  In her letter of resignation, dated December 28, 1990, appellant accused the Committee of violating the Contract by not providing a proper evaluation and statement of goals, and by infringing on the scope of her autonomy as superintendent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All was serene for well over a year.  On June 10, 1992, however, appellant, then a citizen and resident of North Carolina, sued for breach of contract in a Rhode Island state court.  She claimed that the City of Cranston, acting through the Committee, disregarded duties owed under the contract, and she sought damages including the balance of her salary and benefits for the period from January 1, 1991 through June 30, 1992.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Noting the existence of diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332 (1988), Cranston removed the case to federal district court, see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1441 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Chief Judge Lagueux empaneled a jury and trial commenced.  At the close of the appellant's case, Cranston moved for a judgment as a matter of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The district judge assumed arguendo that Cranston had not fulfilled its contractual commitments, but ruled that, even so, the evidence did not permit a rational jury to find a breach of sufficient materiality as to allow appellant to cease performance and recover damages for the balance of the unexpired term.  This appeal followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

See Rolon-Alvarado v. Municipality of San Juan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194861\"><a href=\"/opinion/194861/rolon-alvarado-v-municipality-of-sj/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 76 (1st Cir.1993);  Wagenmann v.

A judgment as a matter of law may be granted only if the evidence, viewed from the perspective most favorable to the nonmovant, is so one-sided that the movant is plainly entitled to judgment, for reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194861\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rolon-Alvarado,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/194861/rolon-alvarado-v-municipality-of-sj/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because granting a judgment as a matter of law depends upon the legal sufficiency of the evidence, appellate review is plenary.  See Jordan-Milton Mach., Inc. v. F/V Teresa Marie, II, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593295\"><a href=\"/opinion/593295/jordan-milton-machinery-inc-v-fv-teresa-marie-ii/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.1992).

ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The substantive law of Rhode Island governs in this diversity case.  Under Rhode Island law, a contracting party may cease performance and seek damages if the other contracting party commits a breach that is \"material,\" see, e.g., Philip Carey Mfg. Co. v. General Prods.  Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2057340\"><a href=\"/opinion/2057340/philip-carey-mfg-co-v-general-products-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span>, 493 (1959), or that \"goes to the essence of the contract,\" Aiello Constr., Inc. v. Nationwide Tractor Trailer Training &amp; Placement Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">861</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2164497\"><a href=\"/opinion/2164497/aiello-const-inc-v-nationwide-tractor-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, 87 (1980).  Some courts and commentators have cast the standard in terms of a \"total\" breach as opposed to a \"partial\" breach, with only the former justifying termination of a contract.  See, e.g., Lovink v. Guilford Mills, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"525562\"><a href=\"/opinion/525562/g-jaap-lovink-v-guilford-mills-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></a></span>, 586-87 (2d Cir.1989);  Arthur L. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts Sec. 946, at 809 (1951).  Because we believe these terms constitute various ways of saying the same thing, we will use them interchangeably.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant invites us to rule that materiality is always a question of fact, thereby eliminating the possibility of a directed verdict where, as here, the issue is disputed.  We decline the invitation.  While the state supreme court has indicated that, in this context, materiality \"is essentially a factual question,\" and that its resolution ordinarily \"requires consideration of all the pertinent evidence and the conduct and relationship of the parties,\" Dunne Leases Cars &amp; Trucks, Inc. v. Kenworth Truck Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1971777\"><a href=\"/opinion/1971777/dunne-leases-cars-trucks-inc-v-kenworth-truck-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1153</span></a></span>, 1160 (R.I.1983), the first part of this statement is a generalization, and, like most generalizations, it admits of exceptions.  Though questions of materiality are usually to be determined by the trier of fact, in this case the jury, the rule is not universal.  As is true of virtually any factual question, if the materiality question in a given case admits of only one reasonable answer (because the evidence on the point is either undisputed or sufficiently lopsided), then the court must intervene and address what is ordinarily a factual question as a question of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The task of delineating which particular breaches may justify an injured party ceasing performance and bringing an action for damages is demanding, but the case law affords some insights.  In Aiello, for example, the plaintiff, a contractor, sued a property owner for nonpayment of installments due under a construction contract.  The Rhode Island Supreme Court upheld a finding that the defendant's failure to pay installments as they came due went to the essence of the contract and, therefore, excused further performance by the plaintiff.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2164497\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Aiello,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2164497/aiello-const-inc-v-nationwide-tractor-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>.   In Dunne, the court upheld a finding that a dealer committed a material breach of its franchise agreement with a truck manufacturer by failing to honor its promise to separate its leasing activities from its dealership operation.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1971777\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Dunne,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1971777/dunne-leases-cars-trucks-inc-v-kenworth-truck-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1159</span></a></span>.   In its opinion, the court emphasized the presence of evidence that the leasing activities adversely impacted the truck dealership in the areas of parking, cleanliness, parts sales, and service.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1971777\"><a href=\"/opinion/1971777/dunne-leases-cars-trucks-inc-v-kenworth-truck-co/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1158. </a></span>  On this basis, the court concluded that the dealer's breach might be deemed material even though the dealer regularly achieved its sales quota under the franchise agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1971777\"><a href=\"/opinion/1971777/dunne-leases-cars-trucks-inc-v-kenworth-truck-co/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1159.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the insights that can be gleaned from these cases, the Rhode Island courts thus far have not precisely defined what constitutes a material breach.  Nonetheless, we believe that the proper analysis is informed by certain commentaries and decisions from outside Rhode Island.  See Michelin Tires (Canada), Ltd. v. First Nat'l Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398010\"><a href=\"/opinion/398010/michelin-tires-canada-ltd-v-first-national-bank-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></a></span>, 682 (1st Cir.1981) (\"In the absence of a definitive ruling by the highest state court, a federal court may consider analogous decisions, considered dicta, scholarly works, and any other reliable data tending convincingly to show how the highest court in the state would decide the issue at hand, taking into account the broad policies and trends so evinced.\")  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  The Restatement is an especially helpful source of guidance because Rhode Island courts frequently turn to the Restatement to fill gaps in state law.  See, e.g., Bibby's Refrig., Heating &amp; Air Cond.  Inc. v. Salisbury, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2310395\"><a href=\"/opinion/2310395/bibbys-refrigeration-heating-air-conditioning-inc-v-salisbury/\"><span class=\"volume\">603</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">726</span></a></span>, 729 (1992);  Durapin, Inc. v. American Prods., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2334248\"><a href=\"/opinion/2334248/durapin-inc-v-american-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">559</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1051</span></a></span>, 1059 (1989).  The Restatement lists five factors that may be considered in determining whether a breach is material.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Other commentators have espoused slightly different sets of relevant factors for use in determining materiality, such as the extent to which the contract has been performed at the time of the breach, the willfulness vel non of the breach, and the degree of seriousness attributable to the breach, expressed in quantitative terms.  See 2 E. Allan Farnsworth, Farnsworth On Contracts Sec. 8.16, at 442 (1990);  J. Calamari &amp; J. Perillo, Contracts 408-09 (2d ed. 1977).  We believe that when the occasion arises, the Rhode Island Supreme Court will adopt some variant of these tests to determine the materiality of a breach of contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  In our view, the test will concentrate on factors such as those listed in the Restatement, with special emphasis, in the employment context, on the extent to which the alleged breach interferes with the duties and benefits flowing from the contract in its entirety.  We need not dice matters too finely, however, for appellant's proof can meet neither the Restatement standard nor any reasonable variant of it.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While a material breach of an employment contract need not completely frustrate the entire purpose of the contract, it must be so important that it makes continued performance by the plaintiff virtually pointless, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"525562\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Lovink,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/525562/g-jaap-lovink-v-guilford-mills-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">587</span></a></span>.   Thus, if Cranston refused to pay appellant, or, conversely, if appellant completely withheld her services for no valid reason, the ensuing breach would reach the essence of the Contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But that is not what transpired here.  We think it is readily apparent that, under the stringent standard that obtains, the Committee's alleged breaches of the Contract are, as a matter of law, not material.  The superintendent's job encompasses a complex and varied set of responsibilities.  Under a provision of the Rhode Island General Laws, which is incorporated into the Contract by explicit reference, the post includes a vast array of administrative, supervisory, managerial, and policymaking functions.  See R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 16-2-11 (1988), reprinted in the appendix.  This elaborate compendium of responsibilities, complemented by the multifarious provisions of the Contract itself, put appellant's grievances into proper perspective.  And so viewed, we are unable to see how a reasonable jury could find that the Committee's conduct involved matters of sufficient significance to constitute a material breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's flagship claim pirouettes around the Committee's failure to provide her with a unified evaluation.  Given the admitted feedback that appellant received from a majority of the individual Committee members, we cannot discern how the failure to reduce the feedback to a unified evaluation or the other shortcomings in the evaluation process could be deemed a material breach.  Without the evaluation, appellant was still able to carry out virtually all of her responsibilities.  She still received the overwhelming majority of the benefits to which the Contract entitled her.  Her mere testimony that without the evaluation provision she would not have signed the employment agreement cannot make this otherwise unremarkable provision into one that \"goes to the essence of the contract.\"  Salo Landscape &amp; Constr.  Co. v. Liberty Elec. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1907352\"><a href=\"/opinion/1907352/salo-landscape-construction-co-inc-v-liberty-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1379</span></a></span>, 1382 (1977).  The determination of materiality, like other aspects of contract interpretation, must be based largely on a standard of objective reasonableness rather than purely subjective belief.  Cf. John F. Davis Co. v. Shepard Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3865779\"><a href=\"/opinion/4106031/davis-co-v-the-shepard-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3865779\"><a href=\"/opinion/4106031/davis-co-v-the-shepard-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span>, 637 (1946) (noting that the \"true question\" in determining the intention of the parties is \"not what intention existed in the minds of the parties, but what intention is expressed by the language used\") (internal quotation marks omitted);  Pahlavi v. Palandjian, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481995\"><a href=\"/opinion/481995/chahram-pahlavi-v-petros-palandjian/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></a></span>, 945 (1st Cir.1987) (commenting that \"contracting parties are bound by objective manifestations and expressions, not subjective expectations\").  In other words, a party cannot transmogrify a provision that, from an objective standpoint, has only marginal significance into one of central salience by the simple expedient of saying in retrospect that she believed it to be very important.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, notwithstanding plaintiff's post hoc rationalization, the Committee's failure to provide a unified evaluation seems much more a matter of form than of substance.  It did not in any way shrink plaintiff's major duties or deprive her of the principal benefits of her contractual bargain.  Nothing about the failure betokens bad faith or an unfair course of conduct.  And the sockdolager is that, at the time Dr. Gibson resigned, there was a high likelihood that the Committee would soon cure its breach by providing an evaluation;  a special meeting for this purpose was scheduled to occur less than one week after she precipitously resigned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's fallback position is that the Committee never furnished her with a written statement of goals.  But appellant had ample contact with the Committee and its members to get a sense of the school system's objectives.  Thus, as with the first alleged breach, this failure did not interfere significantly with either her duties or her benefits under the Contract.  Consequently, it could not be deemed a material breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant alleges that the Committee infringed upon her administrative responsibilities.  She offers two incidents to illustrate her contention:  a Committee member's action in sending a questionnaire directly to the faculty, see supra note 1, and the AHC's attempt to exclude her from its deliberations.  Given the minor nature of these supposed infractions and their subsequent resolution, no reasonable jury could find that they constitute a material breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

Because Rhode Island law treats a suit against the treasurer of a municipality, in his or her official capacity, as a suit against the city, see R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 45-15-5 (1991), these two defendants are in effect the same entity.

Mid-trial directed verdicts should be the exception, not the rule.  We concluded long ago that refraining from granting a judgment as a matter of law until the jury has had a chance to deal with the merits is frequently a \"wise and time-saving precaution.\"  Talbot-Windsor Corp. v.

By following that course, the judge minimizes the risk that the trial will have to be replayed yet retains the power to pass on the sufficiency of the evidence in a timely manner.

Although this case, in its present posture, does not require us to make a finer distinction, we do not deprecate the possibility that there may be an intermediate level of breach, i.e., breaches which are not serious enough to warrant repudiation of the contract and a suit for damages by the injured party, but which nonetheless might constitute a defense to an action for damages brought by the party committing the initial breach.  Thus, our holding that the Committee's alleged breaches were not material, see infra, does not necessarily betoken that Dr. Gibson would have been liable had the Committee sued her for breach</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Although Dunne involved allegations that the defendant's decision to terminate the franchise agreement had been reached without \"due cause\" as then required by R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 31-5.1-4(C)(3) (1979 reenactment), the Rhode Island Supreme Court interpreted \"due cause\" as turning on the materiality of certain breaches committed by the franchisee.
