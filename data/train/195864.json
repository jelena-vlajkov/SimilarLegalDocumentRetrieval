This  was  once  a potentially  complex  case\r                          \n\nconcerning commercial  and banking events and  practice.  Because\n\nof  procedural  default, it  now  presents  only easily  resolved\n\nissues concerning the district court's exercise of discretion.\n\n     The plaintiffs, Caribbean Wholesales and Service Corporation\n\nand Supreme Electronics Distributors (Caribbean), a wholesaler of\n\nelectronic appliances, alleged that Novedades Guerra (Novedades),\n\na local retailer, purchased appliances from Caribbean with checks\n\nthat were returned by  the defendant, the First National  Bank of\n\nBoston (FNBB), for lack  of sufficient funds.  Unable  to collect\n\nfrom Novedades, Caribbean filed this  action to collect from FNBB\n\nthe  sum  of the  returned checks,  plus  lost profits  and other\n\ndamages totalling  $3,000,000.  The allegations  of the complaint\n\nsounded  in  contract,  negligence, breach  of  fiduciary duties,\n\nunsound banking practices, tortious interference with contractual\n\nopportunities, and, principally, fraud.   The essential theme was\n\nthat FNBB  induced  Caribbean to  sell  appliances on  credit  to\n\nNovedades   upon  the  representation   that  FNBB   would  honor\n\nNovedades'  checks,  that  FNBB  reneged  on  its representation,\n\nfailed  to  monitor  Novedades,  and  caused  checks  payable  to\n\nCaribbean to be dishonored.\n\n     The  record reveals some 169  docket entries in a three-year\n\nperiod -- over one a week -- of motions, requests for extensions,\n\norders, responses,  replies to responses,  objections, opposition\n\nto  objections,  notices, and  reports.    The following  crucial\n\nevents took place fifteen months after filing of the complaint:\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n          March 15, 1993 -- FNBB moves for summary judgment.\n\n     No opposition is  filed within ten days,  as Local Rule\n\n     311.5 required,  nor is any request  made for extension\n\n     of time.\n\n          March   30,  1993   --  At   pretrial  conference,\n\n     plaintiffs request an extension  until April 12 to file\n\n     an  opposition to  summary judgment;  this  is granted.\n\n     But no opposition was filed.\n\n          March  31,   1993  --  Plaintiffs'  counsel   moves  to\n\n     withdraw.\n\n          April 7,  1993 --  Plaintiff and counsel  have composed\n\n     their differences, and request another extension until April\n\n     27.  This is denied.\n\n          April 27, 1993 --  Plaintiffs submit yet another motion\n\n     asking  for \"a  ten  working day  extension\"  to file  their\n\n     opposition.  This also is denied.\n\n          April  28, 1993  --  With only  the bank's  uncontested\n\n     factual   submission  before   him,  the   magistrate  judge\n\n     recommends granting the summary judgment motion.\n\n          May 13, 1993 -- The  district court approves the report\n\n     of the magistrate judge.   On the same day,  plaintiffs file\n\n     an opposition  to the  report, accompanied  by a request  to\n\n     file  a  second amended  complaint  and  a motion  tendering\n\n     anticipatory  testimony by  an expert  witness who  had been\n\n     excluded.\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n     Following this, the  court generously set  aside its May  13\n\njudgment,  accepted  \"Plaintiffs'  Objection  to  the  Magistrate\n\nJudge's Report and Recommendation,\" and granted leave to  FNBB to\n\nfile an opposition.  FNBB promptly complied, making the following\n\nsalient points:\n\n     1.   The late  request to  amend, offered four  months after\n\nthe December 22, 1992, Initial Scheduling Conference Order (which\n\nestablished December 31,  1992, as the cut-off date  for amending\n\npleadings, and which stated, \"These dates shall not be changed.\")\n\nshould not be  allowed.  The bank  cited Riofrio Anda  v. Ralston\r                                                                           \n\nPurina,  Co., 959 F.2d 1149,  1154-55 (1st Cir.  1992) (denial of\r                      \n\nmotion to amend two months after deadline.)\n\n     2.   The  motion  to  allow  the  anticipated  testimony  of\n\nplaintiffs'  expert   witness  Myers   should  not  be   allowed.\n\nPlaintiffs  had   not  complied   with  the   Initial  Scheduling\n\nConference Order (concerning notice of the identity of a proposed\n\nwitness,  a   short  statement  of  the   subject  of  testimony,\n\njustification  of a  late addition,  and a  copy of  the expert's\n\ncurriculum vitae).   The order had stated:   \"Non-compliance with\n\nthis order will  result in  such witnesses not  being allowed  to\n\ntestify at  trial.\"  Moreover,  the magistrate  judge's order  of\n\nMarch 16, rejecting the witness, had been appealed by plaintiffs,\n\nand previously affirmed by the district court on April 13.\n\n     3.   The  magistrate  judge's  denial of  plaintiffs'  third\n\nrequest for an extension of time to file objections to the report\n\nshould be upheld.  \n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n     4.   On  the  merits  of   plaintiffs'  claim  that  summary\n\njudgment  was not  warranted,  plaintiffs failed  to present  any\n\nargument before the magistrate judge and may not  use the de novo\r                                                                           \n\nreview proceedings afforded by Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b) to offer new\n\nmaterial.  FNBB cited Paterson-Leitch v. Massachusetts  Municipal\r                                                                           \n\nWholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 991 (1st Cir.  1988), where we\r                             \n\nsaid:  \"In  a nutshell, the argument .  . . could have  been, but\n\ninexplicably  was not, presented  to the magistrate  in the first\n\ninstance.  The appellant is not entitled to yet another nibble at\n\nthis particular apple.\"   See also Borden v. Secretary  of Health\r                                                                           \n\nand Human Servs., 836 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1987). \r                          \n\n     The district court, after  considering the Objection and the\n\nOpposition,  first  denied  plaintiffs  leave to  file  a  Second\n\nAmended  Complaint,  then  refused   to  admit  the   anticipated\n\ntestimony  of  plaintiffs' expert  witness.    Having made  these\n\nrulings,   the  court   then   denied   plaintiffs'  motion   for\n\nreconsideration  and  reaffirmed its  adoption of  the magistrate\n\njudge's   Report  and   Recommendation  on   the  basis   of  the\n\nuncontroverted facts  that were before him.   The court thereupon\n\nentered summary judgment for FNBB.\n\n     We  readily   affirm.    The  district   court  took  action\n\nextraordinarily  favorable  to plaintiffs  in  entertaining their\n\nuntimely  objections  to the  magistrate  judge's  Report in  the\n\nabsence of  any meritorious  excuse.   The  court's most  crucial\n\ndecision  was  to refuse  the request  to  file a  Second Amended\n\nComplaint.   That this was  within its discretion  is clear.   We\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\ndoubt that  a case  can  be found  where the  refusal  of such  a\n\nrequest, made four months after a deadline for amended pleadings,\n\nand in the absence  of significant extenuating circumstances, has\n\nbeen reversed for abuse  of discretion.  To the  extent that such\n\nan  amended pleading  replicated  its predecessor,  its exclusion\n\nmade little  difference; to  the extent  that  it introduced  new\n\nmaterial,  its admission at such a late date would have initiated\n\na  significantly  altered  litigation.   Moreover,  allowing  new\n\nmaterial and  issues based therein,  which were not  presented to\n\nthe  magistrate  judge,  would  have  violated  the  longstanding\n\nprinciple recognized in Paterson- Leitch, 840 F.2d at 990-91.  We\r                                                  \n\nhave  scanned the new material  and see nothing  to indicate that\n\nits  exclusion  worked any  injustice.   There  was not  abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n     The exclusion of the  \"anticipated\" testimony of plaintiffs'\n\nexpert witness also  obviously was  not an  abuse of  discretion.\n\nThe original  ruling stemmed  from plaintiffs' failure  to comply\n\nwith the  Initial Scheduling Conference  Order and no  reason was\n\ngiven to support changing this decision.\n\n     Given these  rulings, the only factual  materials before the\n\ncourt were  those  submitted  to  the magistrate  judge  and  not\n\ncontroverted by  plaintiffs.    These provided  no  basis  for  a\n\nreversal of summary judgment.\n\n     We refuse  to interfere  with the district  court's decision\n\nnot  to impose sanctions  for temerity  at the  trial level.   We\n\ncannot recall any instance  where we have found a  similar ruling\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nto be  an abuse of discretion.   But, whatever may  have been the\n\nmerits at the outset of this litigation, there could have been no\n\nreasonable  expectation of success in this  appeal.  We therefore\n\naward  defendant double  costs and  $1,000 toward  its attorney's\n\nfees, to be chargeable to appellants and their counsel jointly.\n\n     We affirm  the judgments underlying both appeals.  Costs and\n\nfees as indicated.\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n",

Secretary of Health and Human Servs., 836 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, after considering the Objection and the Opposition, first denied plaintiffs leave to file a Second Amended Complaint, then refused to admit the anticipated testimony of plaintiffs' expert witness.  Having made these rulings, the court then denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration and reaffirmed its adoption of the magistrate judge's Report and Recommendation on the basis of the uncontroverted facts that were before him.  The court thereupon entered summary judgment for FNBB.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We readily affirm.  The district court took action extraordinarily favorable to plaintiffs in entertaining their untimely objections to the magistrate judge's Report in the absence of any meritorious excuse.  The court's most crucial decision was to refuse the request to file a Second Amended Complaint.  That this was within its discretion is clear.  We doubt that a case can be found where the refusal of such a request, made four months after a deadline for amended pleadings, and in the absence of significant extenuating circumstances, has been reversed for abuse of discretion.  To the extent that such an amended pleading replicated its predecessor, its exclusion made little difference;  to the extent that it introduced new material, its admission at such a late date would have initiated a significantly altered litigation.  Moreover, allowing new material and issues based therein, which were not presented to the magistrate judge, would have violated the longstanding principle recognized in Paterson- Leitch, 840 F.2d at 990-91.  We have scanned the new material and see nothing to indicate that its exclusion worked any injustice.  There was not abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The exclusion of the \"anticipated\" testimony of plaintiffs' expert witness also obviously was not an abuse of discretion.  The original ruling stemmed from plaintiffs' failure to comply with the Initial Scheduling Conference Order and no reason was given to support changing this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these rulings, the only factual materials before the court were those submitted to the magistrate judge and not controverted by plaintiffs.  These provided no basis for a reversal of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We refuse to interfere with the district court's decision not to impose sanctions for temerity at the trial level.  We cannot recall any instance where we have found a similar ruling to be an abuse of discretion.  But, whatever may have been the merits at the outset of this litigation, there could have been no reasonable expectation of success in this appeal.  We therefore award defendant double costs and $1,000 toward its attorney's fees, to be chargeable to appellants and their counsel jointly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the judgments underlying both appeals.

Martinez-Jimenez for Carribbean Wholesales and Services Corporation and Supreme Electronics Distributors, Inc.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Manuel Moreda-Toledo for The First National Bank of Boston, N.A.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Selya, Circuit Judge, Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge, and Stahl, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Per Curiam.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was once a potentially complex case concerning commercial and banking events and practice.  Because of procedural default, it now presents only easily resolved issues concerning the district court's exercise of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs, Caribbean Wholesales and Service Corporation and Supreme Electronics Distributors (Caribbean), a wholesaler of electronic appliances, alleged that Novedades Guerra (Novedades), a local retailer, purchased appliances from Caribbean with checks that were returned by the defendant, the First National Bank of Boston<sup>BB</sup>, for lack of sufficient funds.  Unable to collect from Novedades, Caribbean filed this action to collect from FNBB the sum of the returned checks, plus lost profits and other damages totalling $3,000,000.  The allegations of the complaint sounded in contract, negligence, breach of fiduciary duties, unsound banking practices, tortious interference with contractual opportunities, and, principally, fraud.  The essential theme was that FNBB induced Caribbean to sell appliances on credit to Novedades upon the representation that FNBB would honor Novedades' checks, that FNBB reneged on its representation, failed to monitor Novedades, and caused checks payable to Caribbean to be dishonored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reveals some 169 docket entries in a three-year period-over one a week-of motions, requests for extensions, orders, responses, replies to responses, objections, opposition to objections, notices, and reports.  The following crucial events took place fifteen months after filing of the complaint:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">March 15, 1993-FNBB moves for summary judgment.  No opposition is filed within ten days, as Local Rule 311.5 required, nor is any request made for extension of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">March 30, 1993-At pretrial conference, plaintiffs request an extension until April 12 to file an opposition to summary judgment;  this is granted.  But no opposition was filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">March 31, 1993-Plaintiffs' counsel moves to withdraw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">April 7, 1993-Plaintiff and counsel have composed their differences, and request another extension until April 27.  This is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">April 27, 1993-Plaintiffs submit yet another motion asking for \"a ten working day extension\" to file their opposition.  This also is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">April 28, 1993-With only the bank's uncontested factual submission before him, the magistrate judge recommends granting the summary judgment motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May 13, 1993-The district court approves the report of the magistrate judge.  On the same day, plaintiffs file an opposition to the report, accompanied by a request to file a second amended complaint and a motion tendering anticipatory testimony by an expert witness who had been excluded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following this, the court generously set aside its May 13 judgment, accepted \"Plaintiffs' Objection to the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation,\" and granted leave to FNBB to file an opposition.  FNBB promptly complied, making the following salient points:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  The late request to amend, offered four months after the December 22, 1992, Initial Scheduling Conference Order (which established December 31, 1992, as the cut-off date for amending pleadings, and which stated, \"These dates shall not be changed.\") should not be allowed.  The bank cited Riofrio Anda v. Ralston Purina, Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580297\"><a href=\"/opinion/580297/luis-riofrio-anda-v-ralston-purina-co-luis-riofrio-anda-v-ralston/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1149</span></a></span>, 1154-55 (1st Cir. 1992) (denial of motion to amend two months after deadline.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The motion to allow the anticipated testimony of plaintiffs' expert witness Myers should not be allowed.  Plaintiffs had not complied with the Initial Scheduling Conference Order (concerning notice of the identity of a proposed witness, a short statement of the subject of testimony, justification of a late addition, and a copy of the expert's curriculum vitae).  The order had stated:  \"Non-compliance with this order will result in such witnesses not being allowed to testify at trial.\"  Moreover, the magistrate judge's order of March 16, rejecting the witness, had been appealed by plaintiffs, and previously affirmed by the district court on April 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The magistrate judge's denial of plaintiffs' third request for an extension of time to file objections to the report should be upheld.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. On the merits of plaintiffs' claim that summary judgment was not warranted, plaintiffs failed to present any argument before the magistrate judge and may not use the de novo review proceedings afforded by Fed.  R. Civ. P. 72(b) to offer new material.  FNBB cited Paterson-Leitch v. Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Elec. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502424\"><a href=\"/opinion/502424/paterson-leitch-company-inc-v-massachusetts-municipal-wholesale-electric/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span>, 991 (1st Cir. 1988), where we said:  \"In a nutshell, the argument ... could have been, but inexplicably was not, presented to the magistrate in the first instance.
