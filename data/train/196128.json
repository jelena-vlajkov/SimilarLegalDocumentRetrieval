Argermiro  Aya  pleaded  guilty  to\r                                 \r\n\npossession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of\r\n\n21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1).   The district court sentenced  him to\r\n\n57 months imprisonment.   On appeal  from this sentence,  Aya\r\n\nraises only one issue.  He contends that the sentencing court\r\n\nerred in reducing his  offense level by only two  levels, for\r\n\nhis  role in the offense as a \"minor\" participant, instead of\r\n\nby four levels,  in recognition  of his role  as a  \"minimal\"\r\n\nparticipant.   See   United  States   Sentencing  Commission,\r                              \r\n\nGuidelines  Manual,    3B1.2  (November,  1993)  (\"Sentencing\r                              \r\n\nGuidelines\").

Background\r                                                 \r\n\n          The  following  facts  are derived  from  the  pre-\r\n\nsentence report (\"PSR\") to which neither party objected.  Aya\r\n\narrived in Puerto Rico at the Luis Munoz  Marin International\r\n\nairport  on May  14, 1994  on a  flight from Panama  City, en\r\n\nroute  to   Madrid,  Spain.    U.S.   Customs  officials  had\r\n\nidentified  Aya  and  two  other passengers  as  fitting  the\r\n\nprofile of a narcotics  trafficker.  Custom agents separately\r\n\nstopped both  Aya and another passenger,  later identified as\r\n\nHector R. Zamora-Velez, at  the airport in Puerto Rico.   Pat\r\n\ndowns and  subsequent searches  revealed that Aya  and Zamora\r\n\nwere each  wearing vests with pockets  containing packages of\r\n\ncocaine.  The cocaine found on  Aya had a net weight of 4,503\r\n\ngrams or 4.5 kilograms and an average purity strength of 81%.\r\r\n\nThe  cocaine found on Zamora had  a net weight of 4,339 grams\r\n\nand an average purity strength of 77%.\r\n\n          According to  the PSR, Zamora waived  his rights at\r\n\nthe  time  of his  arrest  and stated  that  he and  Aya were\r\n\ntravelling together.  He said that a few weeks earlier he had\r\n\nbeen approached in Colombia by an (unnamed) person  who asked\r\n\nhim if he wanted  to earn $5,000.   That person provided  Aya\r\n\nand Zamora with passports, airline tickets and a small amount\r\n\nof cash.  The two allegedly obtained the cocaine and vests in\r\n\nPanama, where they  boarded the plane  for Spain, via  Puerto\r\n\nRico.  Aya, in a later conversation with a probation officer,\r\n\nalso stated  that he was  going to  be paid  $5,000 upon  the\r\n\ndelivery  of the  drugs in  Spain.   He  claimed that  he had\r\n\nagreed  to smuggle the drugs  because he needed  the money to\r\n\npay his father's medical bills.\r\n\n          A  two-count indictment charged Aya with possession\r\n\nwith  intent to  distribute  approximately 5.1  kilograms  of\r\n\ncocaine  (Count  One)  and  importing the  same  quantity  of\r\n\ncocaine (Count  Two).   After initially pleading  not guilty,\r\n\nAya  changed his plea  to guilty on Count  One, pursuant to a\r\n\nplea  agreement  entered  on  July 26,  1994,  in  which  the\r\n\ngovernment  agreed to move for  dismissal of Count  Two.  The\r\n\nparties  also agreed  to  stipulate that  Aya was  personally\r\n\nresponsible for  the possession with intent  to distribute of\r\n\n4.5 kilograms of cocaine.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n          A  PSR  was prepared,  recommending a  base offense\r\n\nlevel of 30 and a reduction of three levels for acceptance of\r\n\nresponsibility and two  levels for Aya's role  in the offense\r\n\nas a  \"courier\". See  U.S.S.G.    3B1.2(b)  (providing for  a\r                                \r\n\ndecrease  of  two levels  where  the  defendant is  a  \"minor\r\n\nparticipant\").   The total offense level of 25 and a criminal\r\n\nhistory category of I yielded a guideline sentencing range of\r\n\n57 to 71 months.  There were no objections to the PSR.\r\n\n          At  the  sentencing  hearing,  the  district  court\r\n\ndenied defendant's request for a four-level reduction for his\r\n\nrole  as a \"minimal\" participant in the offense.  The reasons\r\n\ngiven,  if any,  are  not included  as  part of  the  record.\r\n\n(Apparently, a  transcript of the sentencing  hearing was not\r\n\nprepared.)  The sentencing court adopted the factual findings\r\n\nand guideline application in the PSR, however, which included\r\n\na finding  that Aya's  role was as  a courier.   Although the\r\n\nstatutory  mandatory minimum  sentence  was five  years,  the\r\n\ndistrict court agreed with  defendant and the government that\r\n\nAya  met the criteria under 18 U.S.C.   3553(f).1  Therefore,\r\n\nthe court imposed a prison sentence of 57 months. \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Section 3553(f) provides that a Guideline  sentence below\r\nthe  statutory minimum may be imposed  for defendants with no\r\nmore than 1 criminal history point, if certain other criteria\r\nare also met.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n                       II. Discussion  \r                                                 \r\n\n          Section 3B1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides\r\n\nfor reductions in a defendant's  offense level based upon his\r\n\nrole in the offense: a decrease of 4 levels if  the defendant\r\n\nwas a \"minimal participant\" and a decrease of 2 levels if the\r\n\ndefendant  was  a \"minor  participant.\"    Commentary to  the\r\n\nSentencing Guidelines provides that \"[t]he determination of a\r\n\ndefendant's role in the offense is to be made on the basis of\r\n\nall conduct  within the  scope of  1B1.3  (Relevant Conduct),\r\n\ni.e., all  conduct included under   1B1.3(a)(1)-(4), and  not\r                \r\n\nsolely on the  basis of elements and acts cited  in the count\r\n\nof conviction.\" U.S.S.G.   3B1 (introductory commentary).  In\r\n\nthe  commentary  to    3B1.2,  the  four-level reduction  for\r\n\nminimal participation is explained as follows:\r\n\n          It  is intended  to cover  defendants who\r\n          are  plainly among the  least culpable of\r\n          those   involved  in  the  conduct  of  a\r\n          group.. . . \r\n\n          It   is   intended   that  the   downward\r\n          adjustment for a minimal participant will\r\n          be  used  infrequently.    It   would  be\r\n          appropriate, for example, . . . in a case\r\n          where  an individual  was recruited  as a\r\n          courier    for    a   single    smuggling\r\n          transaction involving a  small amount  of\r\n          drugs.\r\n\nA two-level reduction  for \"minimal\"  participation is  meant\r\n\nfor  a participant  \"who  is less  culpable  than most  other\r\n\nparticipants,  but  whose  role  could not  be  described  as\r\n\nminor.\" U.S.S.G.   3B1.2 (commentary).\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n          The defendant has the burden of proving entitlement\r\n\nto  a downward adjustment pursuant to   3B1.2.

This  court has recently\r\n\nemphasized  that  \"[r]ole-in-the  offense determinations  are\r\n\ninnately  fact-specific.     The   court  of   appeals  must,\r\n\ntherefore, pay careful heed to the sentencing judge's views.\"\r\n\nUnited  States v.

Under these\r                                      \r\n\ncircumstances,  the district  court  did not  clearly err  in\r\n\nsentencing  Aya   as  a  \"minor\"  rather   than  a  \"minimal\"\r\n\nparticipant. \r\n\n          Appellant's  sentence is  therefore affirmed.

He contends that the sentencing court erred in reducing his offense level by only two levels, for his role in the offense as a \"minor\" participant, instead of by four levels, in recognition of his role as a \"minimal\" participant.

U.S. Customs officials had identified Aya and two other passengers as fitting the profile of a narcotics trafficker.  Custom agents separately stopped both Aya and another passenger, later identified as Hector R. Zamora-Velez, at the airport in Puerto Rico.

Sec. 841(a)(1).  The district court sentenced him to 57 months imprisonment.  On appeal from this sentence, Aya raises only one issue.  He contends that the sentencing court erred in reducing his offense level by only two levels, for his role in the offense as a \"minor\" participant, instead of by four levels, in recognition of his role as a \"minimal\" participant.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, Sec. 3B1.2 (November, 1993) (\"Sentencing Guidelines\").  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are derived from the pre- sentence report (\"PSR\") to which neither party objected.  Aya arrived in Puerto Rico at the Luis Munoz Marin International airport on May 14, 1994 on a flight from Panama City, en route to Madrid, Spain.  U.S. Customs officials had identified Aya and two other passengers as fitting the profile of a narcotics trafficker.  Custom agents separately stopped both Aya and another passenger, later identified as Hector R. Zamora-Velez, at the airport in Puerto Rico.  Pat downs and subsequent searches revealed that Aya and Zamora were each wearing vests with pockets containing packages of cocaine.  The cocaine found on Aya had a net weight of 4,503 grams or 4.5 kilograms and an average purity strength of 81%.  The cocaine found on Zamora had a net weight of 4,339 grams and an average purity strength of 77%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the PSR, Zamora waived his rights at the time of his arrest and stated that he and Aya were travelling together.  He said that a few weeks earlier he had been approached in Colombia by an (unnamed) person who asked him if he wanted to earn $5,000.  That person provided Aya and Zamora with passports, airline tickets and a small amount of cash.  The two allegedly obtained the cocaine and vests in Panama, where they boarded the plane for Spain, via Puerto Rico.  Aya, in a later conversation with a probation officer, also stated that he was going to be paid $5,000 upon the delivery of the drugs in Spain.  He claimed that he had agreed to smuggle the drugs because he needed the money to pay his father's medical bills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A two-count indictment charged Aya with possession with intent to distribute approximately 5.1 kilograms of cocaine (Count One) and importing the same quantity of cocaine (Count Two).  After initially pleading not guilty, Aya changed his plea to guilty on Count One, pursuant to a plea agreement entered on July 26, 1994, in which the government agreed to move for dismissal of Count Two.  The parties also agreed to stipulate that Aya was personally responsible for the possession with intent to distribute of 4.5 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A PSR was prepared, recommending a base offense level of 30 and a reduction of three levels for acceptance of responsibility and two levels for Aya's role in the offense as a \"courier\".  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.2(b) (providing for a decrease of two levels where the defendant is a \"minor participant\").  The total offense level of 25 and a criminal history category of I yielded a guideline sentencing range of 57 to 71 months.  There were no objections to the PSR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court denied defendant's request for a four-level reduction for his role as a \"minimal\" participant in the offense.  The reasons given, if any, are not included as part of the record.  (Apparently, a transcript of the sentencing hearing was not prepared.)  The sentencing court adopted the factual findings and guideline application in the PSR, however, which included a finding that Aya's role was as a courier.  Although the statutory mandatory minimum sentence was five years, the district court agreed with defendant and the government that Aya met the criteria under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(f).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Therefore, the court imposed a prison sentence of 57 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.
