Stern, United States  Attorney, was on brief for  the United\r                       \nStates.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n                \r\r\n\n*Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\r\r\n\n     Per  Curiam.  Joseph Gilberti was convicted by a jury on\r                            \n\ntwo drug offense counts, 21 U.S.C.    841, 846, and, pursuant\n\nto  a third count, a  jury determined that  his residence was\n\nsubject  to  forfeit because  used  to facilitate  Gilberti's\n\npossession of drugs with  intent to distribute.  21  U.S.C.  \n\n853.   This  court affirmed  and Gilberti  chose not  to seek\n\ncertiorari  although   a  number  of  co-defendants   did  so\n\nunsuccessfully.1   Instead, Gilberti filed a  motion under 28\n\nU.S.C.    2255  challenging the  forfeiture.  In  a carefully\n\nconsidered opinion, the district court denied the motion.\n\n     On appeal,  Gilberti's argument  is  two-fold: that  the\n\njoining of the substantive and forfeiture counts in one trial\n\neffectively prevented  him from testifying on  the forfeiture\n\ncount,  and that  the  forfeiture of  the  house based  on  a\n\nminimal   connection   with  the   drug  transactions   is  a\n\ndisproportionate penalty.   The government has  chosen to by-\n\npass the issue whether section  2255 is an appropriate  means\n\nto  challenge a  forfeiture judgment  and we follow  the same\n\ncourse.  United  States v.  Connell, 6 F.3d  27, 29 n.3  (1st\r                                               \n\nCir. 1993).    \n\n     We agree  with the district court  that Gilberti's first\n\nclaim--that he  was entitled  to  a separate  hearing on  the\n\nforfeiture so that he could  testify solely on that issue--is\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     1United  States v.  Innamorati, 996  F.2d 456,  473 (1st\r                                               \nCir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 409, 459, 1072-73 (1993-\r                                    \n94).\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nforeclosed.  Gilberti was free to  ask for bifurcation before\n\nhis trial  and did not  do so.  The  point is not  that error\n\noccurred but has been waived.  Rather, nothing in the present\n\ncircumstances  made it error at all for the district court to\n\ntry the counts together when  the defendant made no objection\n\nto this course.   See,  e.g., United States  v. Jenkins,  904\r                                                                   \n\nF.2d  549, 557-58  (10th Cir.),  cert. denied,  498  U.S. 962\r                                                         \n\n(1990).\n\n     Gilberti's brief suggests that  the failure of his trial\n\ncounsel  to  move  for   bifurcation  may  have  amounted  to\n\nineffective  assistance.  We see  no basis for  this claim in\n\nthe present record.  There were potential tactical advantages\n\nto  Gilberti in having the  jury consider the  entire case at\n\nonce; and,  given the weight of  government evidence, defense\n\ncounsel could  reasonably have doubted that  later denials by\n\nGilberti himself would carry much weight.\n\n     As for  disproportion in the penalty,  the Supreme Court\n\nhas recently  held that  an excessive  fines  defense may  be\n\noffered  against forfeitures  under  the  Eighth  Amendment.2\n\nBut in this case   Gilberti has forfeited a  residence valued\n\nat  $130,000 based on ample evidence that he had engaged in a\n\nsubstantial and ongoing drug conspiracy and made repeated use\n\nof his  residence  for storage,  planning  and  transactions.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     2Alexander  v. United  States, 113  S. Ct.  2766 (1993);\r                                              \nAustin v. United States, 113 S. Ct. 2801 (1993).\r                                   \n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nConsidering that each  substantive count carried a  potential\n\nfine of $1 million--but no fines were imposed on Gilberti--we\n\nthink that Gilberti  has no colorable claim  under the Eighth\n\nAmendment.\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n",
