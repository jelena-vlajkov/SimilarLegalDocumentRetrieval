Defendants Judith Moreau and\n                                  \n\nWalter and Clara Lawrence  (\"the landowners\") appeal the district\n\ncourt's  thirty percent reduction of an  award of attorneys' fees\n\nbased upon  a failure  of the  landowners' counsel to  adequately\n\ndocument  the charges.   The landowners also  appeal the district\n\ncourt's failure to include certain costs and prejudgment interest\n\nin the award, and the district court's denial of a subsequent fee\n\napplication seeking reimbursement for  fees and expenses incurred\n\nin  prosecuting the initial fee  application.  We  affirm in part\n\nand reverse in part.\n\n                                I.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          The  facts  of this  case  are set  forth  with greater\n\ndetail in  the district  court's opinion regarding  the principal\n\nfee application in  Tennessee Gas  Pipeline Co. v.  104 Acres  of\n                                                                 \n\nLand,  828 F.  Supp. 123  (D. R.I.  1993).   In 1986,  plaintiff-\n    \n\nappellee Tennessee  Gas Pipeline  Co. (\"Tennessee Gas\")  sought a\n\ncertificate  of  public  convenience  from  the   Federal  Energy\n\nRegulatory  Commission   (\"FERC\")  to  allow   Tennessee  Gas  to\n\nconstruct facilities for  the transmission of natural  gas on the\n\nlandowners' property.  In  May 1989, FERC issued Tennessee  Gas a\n\nconditional  certificate for  construction on  the property.   In\n\nDecember 1989  and February  1990, Tennessee Gas  brought eminent\n\ndomain proceedings in the  district court against the landowners,\n\nseeking  to obtain rights-of-way and  a portion of  their land in\n\norder  to construct and maintain  the natural gas  pipeline.  The\n\n                               -3-\n\nlandowners retained  counsel to intervene in  the FERC proceeding\n\nand  requested  FERC  to  modify  its  May  1989  certificate  by\n\nrerouting  the final leg of the proposed line to utilize existing\n\nrights-of-way.   After proceedings  in the  district court and  a\n\nproceeding  before FERC, Tennessee  Gas changed the  route of its\n\npipeline and dismissed the eminent domain proceedings against the\n\nlandowners.  \n\n          The  landowners moved  for costs  and attorneys'  fees,\n\npursuant to  the Uniform Relocation Assistance  and Real Property\n\nAcquisition Policies Act (\"Relocation Act\"), 42 U.S.C.   4601  et\n                                                                 \n\nseq.   On  August  25,  1993,  the  district  court  awarded  the\n    \n\nlandowners attorneys'  fees but disallowed thirty  percent of the\n\nfees requested by the law firm of Simons &amp; Simons (\"Simons\"), one\n\nof the  two  firms that  represented the  landowners, because  it\n\nfound that  the firm failed  to adequately document  its charges.\n\nTennessee  Gas paid  the  fee award  on September  7,  1993.   On\n\nSeptember  22,  1993, the  landowners  filed  a supplemental  fee\n\napplication seeking reimbursement for fees and  expenses incurred\n\nin prosecuting  the principal  fee application during  the period\n\nfrom April 29, 1992, to  March 1993.  On September 24,  1993, the\n\nlandowners filed  a notice of  appeal from  the district  court's\n\norder with respect to the principal fee application.  On March 2,\n\n1994,   the  district   court   entered   judgment  denying   the\n\nsupplemental fee  petition because the court  determined that the\n\npetition  was  untimely.   The  landowners appealed  the  March 2\n\norder.    In  April, this  court  ordered  that  both appeals  be\n\n                               -4-\n\nconsolidated.\n\n                               -5-\n\n                               II.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          A.  Reduction in Attorneys' Fees\n\n          The landowners sought an  award of costs and attorneys'\n\nfees  under  42  U.S.C.      4654,  which  provides  that   in  a\n\ncondemnation action abandoned by  the condemnor, the court \"shall\n\naward\" the  property owner \"such sums  as will in  the opinion of\n\nthe  court  reimburse  such   owner  for  his  reasonable  costs,\n\ndisbursements, and expenses, including  reasonable attorney . . .\n\nfees, actually incurred because of the condemnation proceedings.\"\n\nThe  landowners  contend  that  because  Section  4654  uses  the\n\nmandatory  language \"shall  award,\" an  award of  attorneys' fees\n\nunder  this  section  is  not discretionary,  and  a  landowner's\n\ncomputation  of  hours  should  be  accepted  even  if  there  is\n\ninsufficient documentation  absent a  specific showing  of abuse.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n          Section   4654  provides   for  the   reimbursement  of\n\n\"reasonable\" costs  and fees.   This Court's opinions  \"have left\n\nreasonably  open   the  question  of  precisely   how  the  judge\n\nascertains the number of hours reasonably expended\" by counsel on\n\na case  in which  attorneys' fees are  sought.  United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nMetropolitan  Dist.  Com.,  847  F.2d  12,  16  (1st  Cir.  1988)\n                         \n\n(internal quotations and citation omitted).  \"What  we expect the\n\ntrial  court  to do  is make  concrete  findings, supply  a clear\n\nexplanation  of its reasons  for the fee award,  and most of all,\n\nretain  a sense of overall proportion.\"  Id. (internal quotations\n                                            \n\n                               -6-\n\nand  citations omitted).    Accordingly, we  review the  district\n\ncourt's fee award for  abuse of discretion.  Foley v. Lowell, 948\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          The district  court indicated that it  would employ the\n\nlodestar analysis  in determining  the reasonableness of  the fee\n\napplications.  Tennessee Gas  Pipeline Co., 829 F. Supp.  at 128.\n                                          \n\n\"If an alternative method is not expressly dictated by applicable\n\nlaw, we have customarily found it best to calculate fees by means\n\nof the  [lodestar] time and  rate method. .  . .\"   Weinberger v.\n                                                              \n\nGreat  Northern Nekoosa Corp., 925 F.2d 518, 526 (1st Cir. 1991).\n                             \n\nBecause Section  4654 does not  dictate an alternative  method to\n\ncalculate  fees, the district court's use  of the lodestar method\n\nwas proper.\n\n          Where a district court applies the lodestar method, the\n\nfee-seeker must  usually provide a particularized  account of his\n\nclaim. Id. at  527.  \"[T]he  absence of detailed  contemporaneous\n          \n\ntime records, except  in extraordinary  circumstances, will  call\n\nfor  a substantial reduction in any award or, in egregious cases,\n\ndisallowance.\"   Grendel's Den, Inc. v. Larkin, 749 F.2d 945, 952\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir.  1984).  In order for  litigants to receive fee awards,\n\nthis court has  required that  they submit \"a  full and  specific\n\naccounting of the  tasks performed, the dates of performance, and\n\nthe number of hours spent on each task.\"  Weinberger, 925 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n527 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n\n          The district  court found that the  Simons' time sheets\n\nwere not sufficiently  detailed to enable the court  to determine\n\n                               -7-\n\nwhether  the fees  were excessive or  duplicative.   The district\n\ncourt stated  that \"[t]he  time summaries  are replete  with time\n\ncharges  for such  matters as  'Confer with  co-counsel,' 'Confer\n\nwith  client,' 'Review materials,'  Review documents,' and 'Legal\n\nResearch' without any indication of the subject matter involved.\"\n\nThe  district  court  explained that  in  addition  to  making it\n\nimpossible for the court  to gage whether the task  performed was\n\nwarranted, the failure to include some description of the subject\n\nmatter of the  task made it  impossible to determine if  the time\n\nfactor  allocated was  appropriate  or excessive.   The  district\n\ncourt also found that discrepancies in Simons' submissions raised\n\nquestions as to their accuracy and whether such records were kept\n\ncontemporaneously.    The district  court  clearly explained  its\n\nfindings and the court  was justified in reducing the  fee award.\n\nThe court did not  abuse its discretion by reducing  the award of\n\nfees  claimed by Simons by  thirty percent.   We therefore affirm\n\nthe district court's reduction of Simons' attorneys' fees.\n\n          B.  Prejudgment Interest and other Costs\n\n          In  the  proceedings  before  the  district  court, the\n\nlandowners requested  interest on fees  and costs from  April 29,\n\n1992, the date  they had filed their  motion for fees  and costs.\n\nThe  request for  prejudgment interest  was opposed  by Tennessee\n\nGas.    The  district  court's   opinion  makes  no  mention   of\n\nprejudgment interest  and the  district court's judgment  did not\n\ninclude any  prejudgment interest.   The landowners  also contend\n\nthat  the   district  court,  without   comment  and   apparently\n\n                               -8-\n\ninadvertently, failed to include in the award an item of $889 for\n\ntwo  \"round-trip\"   airfares   between  Washington,   D.C.,   and\n\nProvidence, R.I., to permit counsel for the landowners  to attend\n\na settlement  conference  and  a meeting  on  the  Tennessee  Gas\n\nproject.   According to  the landowners,  the vouchers  for these\n\ntrips, accompanied  by an affidavit describing the purpose of the\n\ntrips, were submitted to the district court and served on counsel\n\nfor Tennessee Gas on March 12, 1993.\n\n          Because the district court  did not advance any reasons\n\nfor  its  denial  of  the  landowners'  request  for  prejudgment\n\ninterest, or the cost of the airline tickets, we will remand this\n\ncase to the  district court so that it  may determine whether the\n\nlandowners  are   entitled  to   prejudgment   interest  and   to\n\nreimbursement for the cost of the airline tickets.\n\n          C.  Supplemental Fee Application\n\n          In  its memorandum  and order  denying the  landowners'\n\nsupplemental fee application,  the district court indicated  that\n\nordinarily a litigant should have one opportunity to obtain fees,\n\nbut that \"[t]here is no reason  why a pending application may not\n\nbe supplemented to the  time the court acts on  the application.\"\n\nThe  court acknowledged that there is  no stated time requirement\n\nfor  filing fee  applications included  in 42  U.S.C.    4601, et\n                                                                 \n\nseq., but stated that there must be some time limit within  which\n    \n\napplications  must  be filed.   The  court  pointed out  that the\n\nSupreme  Court has  indicated  that fee  applications should  not\n\nresult in secondary litigation, Commissioner, I.N.S. v. Jean, 496\n                                                            \n\n                               -9-\n\nU.S. 154, 163  (1990), and  that the First  Circuit has  embraced\n\nthis principle, Par s v.  U.S. Dept. of Housing &amp; Urban Dev., 988\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  236, 241 (1st  Cir. 1993).  The  district court stated that\n\n\"if  [the  landowners']  application  was approved,  it  must  be\n\nexpected that a third  application will be made for  the services\n\nrendered in  connection with this second application.\"  The court\n\nthen pointed out  that \"[h]ere the  second application was  filed\n\nSeptember  12,  1993, 29  days  after  the  court's formal  order\n\nallowing the first petition, more than two months after the court\n\nfiled its opinion, six months after the last of the services were\n\nrendered, and seventeen months after  the beginning of the period\n\nfor which [the landowners] seek reimbursement.\"  The court stated\n\nthat \"[e]xcept in unusual circumstances not present in this case,\n\napplication for  reimbursement for legal services rendered before\n\nthe  court determines a fee application should be made before the\n\ncourt acts on the  application, otherwise reimbursement should be\n\nforegone.\"   The court then concluded that the second application\n\nfor fees came too late.\n\n          The landowners  contend that neither  the Uniform  Real\n\nProperty  Acquisition  Policies  Act  nor  any  other  applicable\n\nstatute imposed a time requirement for filing a  fee application,\n\nand  therefore, by  denying  their application  as untimely,  the\n\ndistrict  court in effect enunciated a new rule which it unfairly\n\napplied  retroactively to  the landowners.   In support  of their\n\nposition,   the  landowners   argue  that   the  amount   of  the\n\nsupplemental  fee claim was unknown at the time the principal fee\n\n                               -10-\n\napplication  was submitted,  and  the landowners  could not  have\n\nknown  precisely  what the  amount of  this  claim was  until the\n\nprincipal application  was resolved.   Therefore, they  could not\n\ndetermine the  amount, or  submit a supplemental  fee application\n\nuntil they had been  awarded fees.  The landowners  also contend,\n\nand the  record shows, that  they advised the  court on  March 3,\n\n1993 -- 4 1/2  months before its preliminary fee  application and\n\nalmost six months before the court entered its judgment regarding\n\nthe  preliminary fee  application  -- that  they  would submit  a\n\nsupplemental fee application at the appropriate time.\n\n          We agree  with the  district court  that there  must be\n\nsome time limit within which a party must file an application for\n\nsupplemental fees,  and  we  believe that  it  is  reasonable  to\n\nrequire, absent any other statutory mandate, that where possible,\n\nsuch application be made  before the court acts on  the principal\n\nfee  application.    In  the  present case,  however,  where  the\n\ndistrict  court  had   not  previously  articulated  this   novel\n\nrequirement,  where  the  landowners  had advised  the  court  in\n\nwriting   of  their   intention  to   file  a   supplemental  fee\n\napplication, and  where Congress has directed  district courts to\n\naward  landowners their  reasonable  costs  and  attorneys'  fees\n\nincurred because  of aborted  condemnation proceedings,  we agree\n\nwith the landowners that it would be unfair, and would contravene\n\nthe  Congressional  purpose,   to  apply  the  district   court's\n\nrequirement retroactively.\n\n          We therefore vacate the district court's order  denying\n\n                               -11-\n\nthe landowners' supplemental fee  application, and remand for the\n\ndistrict court  to determine the  reasonable fees to  be awarded.\n\nWe further order that any application for fees in connection with\n\nthis second application be submitted to the district court before\n\nthe district court acts on the second application.\n\n          Affirmed in part; vacated and remanded in part.\n                                                        \n\n                               -12-\n",

The landowners also  appeal the district\n\ncourt's failure to include certain costs and prejudgment interest\n\nin the award, and the district court's denial of a subsequent fee\n\napplication seeking reimbursement for  fees and expenses incurred\n\nin  prosecuting the initial fee  application.  We  affirm in part\n\nand reverse in part.\n\n                                I.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          The  facts  of this  case  are set  forth  with greater\n\ndetail in  the district  court's opinion regarding  the principal\n\nfee application in  Tennessee Gas  Pipeline Co. v.  104 Acres  of\n                                                                 \n\nLand,  828 F.  Supp. 123  (D. R.I.  1993).   In 1986,  plaintiff-\n    \n\nappellee Tennessee  Gas Pipeline  Co. (\"Tennessee Gas\")  sought a\n\ncertificate  of  public  convenience  from  the   Federal  Energy\n\nRegulatory  Commission   (\"FERC\")  to  allow   Tennessee  Gas  to\n\nconstruct facilities for  the transmission of natural  gas on the\n\nlandowners' property.  In  May 1989, FERC issued Tennessee  Gas a\n\nconditional  certificate for  construction on  the property.   In\n\nDecember 1989  and February  1990, Tennessee Gas  brought eminent\n\ndomain proceedings in the  district court against the landowners,\n\nseeking  to obtain rights-of-way and  a portion of  their land in\n\norder  to construct and maintain  the natural gas  pipeline.  The\n\n                               -3-\n\nlandowners retained  counsel to intervene in  the FERC proceeding\n\nand  requested  FERC  to  modify  its  May  1989  certificate  by\n\nrerouting  the final leg of the proposed line to utilize existing\n\nrights-of-way.   After proceedings  in the  district court and  a\n\nproceeding  before FERC, Tennessee  Gas changed the  route of its\n\npipeline and dismissed the eminent domain proceedings against the\n\nlandowners.  \n\n          The  landowners moved  for costs  and attorneys'  fees,\n\npursuant to  the Uniform Relocation Assistance  and Real Property\n\nAcquisition Policies Act (\"Relocation Act\"), 42 U.S.C.   4601  et\n                                                                 \n\nseq.   On  August  25,  1993,  the  district  court  awarded  the\n    \n\nlandowners attorneys'  fees but disallowed thirty  percent of the\n\nfees requested by the law firm of Simons &amp; Simons (\"Simons\"), one\n\nof the  two  firms that  represented the  landowners, because  it\n\nfound that  the firm failed  to adequately document  its charges.\n\nTennessee  Gas paid  the  fee award  on September  7,  1993.   On\n\nSeptember  22,  1993, the  landowners  filed  a supplemental  fee\n\napplication seeking reimbursement for fees and  expenses incurred\n\nin prosecuting  the principal  fee application during  the period\n\nfrom April 29, 1992, to  March 1993.  On September 24,  1993, the\n\nlandowners filed  a notice of  appeal from  the district  court's\n\norder with respect to the principal fee application.  On March 2,\n\n1994,   the  district   court   entered   judgment  denying   the\n\nsupplemental fee  petition because the court  determined that the\n\npetition  was  untimely.   The  landowners appealed  the  March 2\n\norder.    In  April, this  court  ordered  that  both appeals  be\n\n                               -4-\n\nconsolidated.\n\n                               -5-\n\n                               II.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          A.  Reduction in Attorneys' Fees\n\n          The landowners sought an  award of costs and attorneys'\n\nfees  under  42  U.S.C.      4654,  which  provides  that   in  a\n\ncondemnation action abandoned by  the condemnor, the court \"shall\n\naward\" the  property owner \"such sums  as will in  the opinion of\n\nthe  court  reimburse  such   owner  for  his  reasonable  costs,\n\ndisbursements, and expenses, including  reasonable attorney . . .\n\nfees, actually incurred because of the condemnation proceedings.\"\n\nThe  landowners  contend  that  because  Section  4654  uses  the\n\nmandatory  language \"shall  award,\" an  award of  attorneys' fees\n\nunder  this  section  is  not discretionary,  and  a  landowner's\n\ncomputation  of  hours  should  be  accepted  even  if  there  is\n\ninsufficient documentation  absent a  specific showing  of abuse.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n          Section   4654  provides   for  the   reimbursement  of\n\n\"reasonable\" costs  and fees.   This Court's opinions  \"have left\n\nreasonably  open   the  question  of  precisely   how  the  judge\n\nascertains the number of hours reasonably expended\" by counsel on\n\na case  in which  attorneys' fees are  sought.

The district\n\ncourt stated  that \"[t]he  time summaries  are replete  with time\n\ncharges  for such  matters as  'Confer with  co-counsel,' 'Confer\n\nwith  client,' 'Review materials,'  Review documents,' and 'Legal\n\nResearch' without any indication of the subject matter involved.\"\n\nThe  district  court  explained that  in  addition  to  making it\n\nimpossible for the court  to gage whether the task  performed was\n\nwarranted, the failure to include some description of the subject\n\nmatter of the  task made it  impossible to determine if  the time\n\nfactor  allocated was  appropriate  or excessive.   The  district\n\ncourt also found that discrepancies in Simons' submissions raised\n\nquestions as to their accuracy and whether such records were kept\n\ncontemporaneously.    The district  court  clearly explained  its\n\nfindings and the court  was justified in reducing the  fee award.\n\nThe court did not  abuse its discretion by reducing  the award of\n\nfees  claimed by Simons by  thirty percent.   We therefore affirm\n\nthe district court's reduction of Simons' attorneys' fees.\n\n          B.  Prejudgment Interest and other Costs\n\n          In  the  proceedings  before  the  district  court, the\n\nlandowners requested  interest on fees  and costs from  April 29,\n\n1992, the date  they had filed their  motion for fees  and costs.\n\nThe  request for  prejudgment interest  was opposed  by Tennessee\n\nGas.    The  district  court's   opinion  makes  no  mention   of\n\nprejudgment interest  and the  district court's judgment  did not\n\ninclude any  prejudgment interest.   The landowners  also contend\n\nthat  the   district  court,  without   comment  and   apparently\n\n                               -8-\n\ninadvertently, failed to include in the award an item of $889 for\n\ntwo  \"round-trip\"   airfares   between  Washington,   D.C.,   and\n\nProvidence, R.I., to permit counsel for the landowners  to attend\n\na settlement  conference  and  a meeting  on  the  Tennessee  Gas\n\nproject.   According to  the landowners,  the vouchers  for these\n\ntrips, accompanied  by an affidavit describing the purpose of the\n\ntrips, were submitted to the district court and served on counsel\n\nfor Tennessee Gas on March 12, 1993.\n\n          Because the district court  did not advance any reasons\n\nfor  its  denial  of  the  landowners'  request  for  prejudgment\n\ninterest, or the cost of the airline tickets, we will remand this\n\ncase to the  district court so that it  may determine whether the\n\nlandowners  are   entitled  to   prejudgment   interest  and   to\n\nreimbursement for the cost of the airline tickets.\n\n          C.  Supplemental Fee Application\n\n          In  its memorandum  and order  denying the  landowners'\n\nsupplemental fee application,  the district court indicated  that\n\nordinarily a litigant should have one opportunity to obtain fees,\n\nbut that \"[t]here is no reason  why a pending application may not\n\nbe supplemented to the  time the court acts on  the application.\"\n\nThe  court acknowledged that there is  no stated time requirement\n\nfor  filing fee  applications included  in 42  U.S.C.    4601, et\n                                                                 \n\nseq., but stated that there must be some time limit within  which\n    \n\napplications  must  be filed.   The  court  pointed out  that the\n\nSupreme  Court has  indicated  that fee  applications should  not\n\nresult in secondary litigation, Commissioner, I.N.S. v. Jean, 496\n                                                            \n\n                               -9-\n\nU.S. 154, 163  (1990), and  that the First  Circuit has  embraced\n\nthis principle, Par s v.

The  district court stated that\n\n\"if  [the  landowners']  application  was approved,  it  must  be\n\nexpected that a third  application will be made for  the services\n\nrendered in  connection with this second application.\"  The court\n\nthen pointed out  that \"[h]ere the  second application was  filed\n\nSeptember  12,  1993, 29  days  after  the  court's formal  order\n\nallowing the first petition, more than two months after the court\n\nfiled its opinion, six months after the last of the services were\n\nrendered, and seventeen months after  the beginning of the period\n\nfor which [the landowners] seek reimbursement.\"  The court stated\n\nthat \"[e]xcept in unusual circumstances not present in this case,\n\napplication for  reimbursement for legal services rendered before\n\nthe  court determines a fee application should be made before the\n\ncourt acts on the  application, otherwise reimbursement should be\n\nforegone.\"   The court then concluded that the second application\n\nfor fees came too late.\n\n          The landowners  contend that neither  the Uniform  Real\n\nProperty  Acquisition  Policies  Act  nor  any  other  applicable\n\nstatute imposed a time requirement for filing a  fee application,\n\nand  therefore, by  denying  their application  as untimely,  the\n\ndistrict  court in effect enunciated a new rule which it unfairly\n\napplied  retroactively to  the landowners.   In support  of their\n\nposition,   the  landowners   argue  that   the  amount   of  the\n\nsupplemental  fee claim was unknown at the time the principal fee\n\n                               -10-\n\napplication  was submitted,  and  the landowners  could not  have\n\nknown  precisely  what the  amount of  this  claim was  until the\n\nprincipal application  was resolved.   Therefore, they  could not\n\ndetermine the  amount, or  submit a supplemental  fee application\n\nuntil they had been  awarded fees.  The landowners  also contend,\n\nand the  record shows, that  they advised the  court on  March 3,\n\n1993 -- 4 1/2  months before its preliminary fee  application and\n\nalmost six months before the court entered its judgment regarding\n\nthe  preliminary fee  application  -- that  they  would submit  a\n\nsupplemental fee application at the appropriate time.\n\n          We agree  with the  district court  that there  must be\n\nsome time limit within which a party must file an application for\n\nsupplemental fees,  and  we  believe that  it  is  reasonable  to\n\nrequire, absent any other statutory mandate, that where possible,\n\nsuch application be made  before the court acts on  the principal\n\nfee  application.    In  the  present case,  however,  where  the\n\ndistrict  court  had   not  previously  articulated  this   novel\n\nrequirement,  where  the  landowners  had advised  the  court  in\n\nwriting   of  their   intention  to   file  a   supplemental  fee\n\napplication, and  where Congress has directed  district courts to\n\naward  landowners their  reasonable  costs  and  attorneys'  fees\n\nincurred because  of aborted  condemnation proceedings,  we agree\n\nwith the landowners that it would be unfair, and would contravene\n\nthe  Congressional  purpose,   to  apply  the  district   court's\n\nrequirement retroactively.\n\n          We therefore vacate the district court's order  denying\n\n                               -11-\n\nthe landowners' supplemental fee  application, and remand for the\n\ndistrict court  to determine the  reasonable fees to  be awarded.\n\nWe further order that any application for fees in connection with\n\nthis second application be submitted to the district court before\n\nthe district court acts on the second application.\n\n          Affirmed in part; vacated and remanded in part.\n                                                        \n\n                               -12-\n</pre>",
