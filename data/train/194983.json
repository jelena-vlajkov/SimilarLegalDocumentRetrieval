Plaintiff-appellant  Wolf\n                                \n\nWeinhold1 commenced  suit in state  court against a  bank and\n\nits subsidiary for, inter alia, breach of a written  warranty\n                              \n\nagreement.   The  bank  counterclaimed, seeking  payment from\n\nWeinhold  of  a  facially  unqualified  promissory  note  and\n\npersonal guarantee.  After the  bank failed, the FDIC, in its\n\ncapacity  as receiver,  removed  the  proceedings to  federal\n\ncourt,  and  sought  summary  enforcement  of  the  note  and\n\nguarantee.  The district court granted  the FDIC's motion for\n\nsummary judgment  on  the  note,  and,  in  the  same  order,\n\ndismissed  Weinhold's  warranty  claims  against  the  bank's\n\nsubsidiary.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n           FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                                   \n\n          The corporate affiliations of  the relevant parties\n\nare complex,  so we begin  by tracing  them in some  detail. \n\nFirst  American  Bank  for  Savings  (\"First   American\"),  a\n\nfederally  insured  savings  bank,  owned several  subsidiary\n\ncorporations  which were engaged  in the development  of real\n\nestate projects  in the Boston  area.  One  such wholly-owned\n\nsubsidiary, First American Development Corporation IV (\"FADC-\n\n                    \n\n1.  Weinhold brought suit  in his individual capacity  and in\nhis  capacity as  trustee  of  225  Commonwealth  Trust  (the\nTrust).  References to Weinhold will hereinafter apply to him\nin both capacities unless otherwise noted.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nIV\"),2 formed  a joint  venture with  H&amp;P Associates  Limited\n\nPartnership   II  (\"H&amp;P\").    The  joint  venture,  known  as\n\nCommonwealth-Marlboro   Associates   (\"CMA\"),   acquired   an\n\napartment   building  at   225   Commonwealth  Avenue   (\"the\n\nproperty\")  in Boston, with  the intention of  converting the\n\nproperty to residential  condominiums.3  CMA hired  GVW, Inc.\n\n(\"GVW\"),  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary   of  H&amp;P,  as  general\n\ncontractor for renovation work on the property. \n\n          During  April  1986,  Weinhold   and  Leslie  Levy4\n\nbecame interested in  buying the property from CMA.   To that\n\nend, they  formed 225 Commonwealth  Trust (\"the Trust\").   On\n\nJune 30, 1986,  Weinhold, on behalf of the Trust, bought  the\n\nproperty from CMA.  GVW  had not yet completed renovations to\n\nthe property,  and under the  terms of the purchase  and sale\n\nagreement  between CMA and  Weinhold, the work  of completing\n\nthe  renovations was  left to  GVW.   Among other  terms, the\n\npurchase and sale agreement included the following paragraph:\n\n          [CMA]  and  [GVW]  shall   enter  into  a\n          supplementary  agreement with  [Weinhold]\n          warranting, in  favor of  [Weinhold]: (a)\n          the  construction  of   the  improvements\n\n                    \n\n2.  FADC-I  through  III,  and FADC-V  through  IX  were also\nwholly-owned  subsidiaries of First  American, and were named\nas defendants.  Weinhold does not appeal the rulings below as\nto these parties.\n\n3.  CMA  also acquired a second apartment building in Boston,\nwhich is not at issue in this case.\n\n4.  Levy, a party  below in her capacity as trustee, is not a\nparty to this appeal.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          constituting the Project  for a period of\n          one  (1)  year   after  the  Project   is\n          [s]ubstantially [c]ompleted, and  (b) the\n          structural improvements at the [property]\n          related  to the Project  for a  period of\n          five  (5)  years  after  the  Project  is\n          [s]ubstantially    [c]ompleted.       The\n          warranties   set  forth   in  such   side\n          agreement shall survive the Closing Date.\n\nOn September  3, 1986,  in compliance  with this  contractual\n\nprovision,  CMA executed  a document  in  which it  warranted\n\nGVW's  work on  the property.   Because  FADC-IV was  a joint\n\nventurer in CMA, both the purchase and sale agreement and the\n\nSeptember  3, 1986,  warranty were  executed  by officers  of\n\nFADC-IV.\n\n          In  addition to  purchasing the property  from CMA,\n\nWeinhold  also obtained  financing for  his  purchase of  the\n\nproperty through  First American,  FADC-IV's parent  company,\n\nborrowing $2.4  million from  First American.   The loan  was\n\nevidenced by  a  promissory note  signed by  Weinhold in  the\n\namount   of  $2.4  million,  and  repayment  was  secured  by\n\nWeinhold's personal guarantee and by a  first mortgage on the\n\nproperty. \n\n          Shortly after  the  sale,  disputes  arose  between\n\nWeinhold and GVW regarding the completion of the renovations.\n\nAs a result,  Weinhold terminated GVW as  general contractor.\n\nIn June of 1987, based  on GVW's failure to properly complete\n\nthe   required   renovations,   Weinhold   brought  suit   in\n\nMassachusetts's Suffolk  County Superior Court  against FADC-\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nIV, H&amp;P and GVW alleging,  inter alia, breach of contract and\n                                     \n\nbreach  of  warranty  by  all  defendants.    Foremost  among\n\nWeinhold's claims was his allegation that the renovations did\n\nnot comply with relevant zoning provisions.  \n\n          Weinhold  subsequently added  First  American as  a\n\ndefendant, arguing  that FADC-IV  was an  alter ego of  First\n\nAmerican.   In essence,  Weinhold argued that  First American\n\nwas  liable   for  FADC-IV's  actions,   including  FADC-IV's\n\nwarranty   of   GVW's  renovation   work.     First  American\n\ncounterclaimed, alleging  that  Weinhold had  failed to  make\n\nmortgage payments.  First American sought payment of the note\n\nand enforcement of Weinhold's guarantee.\n\n          On October  19, 1990,  First American was  declared\n\ninsolvent  and the  FDIC  was appointed  receiver.   The FDIC\n\nremoved  the case  to  federal  district  court,  and  sought\n\nsummary judgment on the note and guarantee.   \n\n          In granting the FDIC's motion for summary judgment,\n\nthe district court  ruled that Weinhold  had failed to  offer\n\nproof of  any defense  to payment on  the note  and guarantee\n\nsufficient to satisfy the requisites  of D'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co.\n                                                             \n\nv. FDIC, 315 U.S. 447 (1942).   In a second ruling, the court\n       \n\ndismissed the breach  of warranty claims that  had originally\n\nbeen  brought against  FADC-IV.    The  court  reasoned  that\n\nWeinhold's warranty claims against FADC-IV, like his defenses\n\nto the FDIC's counterclaim, failed to satisfy the demands of \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nthe D'Oench doctrine.  Upon review, we affirm both rulings.\n           \n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA.

Weinhold's Defenses to Payment of the Note\n                                             \n\n          In contending  that the  district court  improperly\n\ngranted  the FDIC's motion for summary judgment, Weinhold has\n\ndone no more than press his affirmative warranty claims.  The\n\nbulk  of Weinhold's appellate  brief is dedicated  to arguing\n\nthat  his warranty claims against First American survive both\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nD'Oench and  12  U.S.C.    1823(e),  which has  been  loosely\n       \n\ndescribed as  D'Oench's codification.5   Apparently, Weinhold\n                     \n\nassumes that  a viable  breach  of warranty  claim, based  on\n\nCMA's  written warranty  of  GVW's construction  work,  would\n\nexcuse  payment on the  promissory note.   Because Weinhold's\n\nassumption in this  regard is erroneous,  we need not  linger\n\nlong over this argument.\n\n          The possibility  of  valid  set-off  or  recoupment\n\nclaims  does not  preclude the  summary  enforcement of  debt\n\ninstruments.   See, e.g., Hunt  v. Bankers Trust Co.,  689 F.\n                                                    \n\nSupp.  666,  672 (N.D.  Tex.  1987).   Weinhold's  breach  of\n\nwarranty  claims are  no  more  than  set-off  or  recoupment\n\nclaims.  They involve issues of zoning, workmanship and other\n\nmatters relating  to GVW's  work on  the renovation  project,\n\nrather  than issues of  liability between Weinhold  and First\n\nAmerican  on  the  note  and  guarantee.   Even  were  we  to\n\ndisregard FADC-IV's  corporate  form, as  we  are  repeatedly\n\nurged to do by Weinhold,  we would find, at most,  that First\n\nAmerican and Weinhold  entered two separate agreements.   The\n\nagreement regarding the loan of $2.4 million, on one hand, is\n\nevidenced   by  the  note,  the  mortgage  and  the  personal\n\n                    \n\n5.  Weinhold  argues  at  great  length  that  First American\nactually  \"approved\" both the purchase and sale agreement and\nthe September  3 warranty  agreement, despite  the fact  that\nboth agreements  were signed by  officers of FADC-IV.   As we\nunderstand it,  this contention  is aimed  solely at  showing\nthat Weinhold's  affirmative warranty claims  survive D'Oench\n                                                             \nand   1823(e).\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nguarantee.   FADC-IV's obligation to convey title to Weinhold\n\nand  to warrant GVW's work, on the  other hand, arises out of\n\nthe  entirely separate purchase  and sale agreement.   Simply\n\nput,  GVW's  allegedly   unacceptable  workmanship  does  not\n\nrelieve  Weinhold of  his  obligations  under  the  note  and\n\nguarantee.6   Cf.  Koch v.  Koch, 903  F.2d 1333,  1335 (10th\n                                \n\nCir. 1990) (affirming summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs\n\nin real estate transaction notwithstanding defendant's claims\n\nbased on separate stock transaction executed between the same\n\nparties on the  same day); Exchange Nat'l Bank  of Chicago v.\n                                                          \n\nDaniels, 768 F.2d 140, 143 (7th Cir. 1985) (affirming summary\n       \n\njudgment  on claim for payment of facially unconditional note\n\nwhere defendant's allegations did not constitute a defense to\n\npayment). \n\n          To  the extent  that Weinhold's  appeal raises  any\n\ndefenses  other than his mistaken reliance on his affirmative\n\nwarranty claims, it  does so in an ineffective  manner.  This\n\ncourt  has   often  warned  litigants   that  issues   raised\n\n                    \n\n6.  To the extent  that the issue of GVW's  workmanship could\never provide a defense to payment  of the note, it could only\nconstitute a  defense of fraud  in the inducement,  a defense\nwhich Weinhold raised in state  court.  However, the  Supreme\nCourt has made clear that    1823(e) precludes the defense of\nfraud in the inducement where the FDIC is suing on a facially\nunqualified promissory note.   See Langley v.  FDIC, 484 U.S.\n                                                   \n86,  94 (1987).   See  also In  re 604  Columbus Ave.  Realty\n                                                             \nTrust, 968 F.2d 1332, 1346 (1st Cir. 1992).  Moreover, to the\n     \nextent  that Weinhold  attempts to  resurrect  on appeal  his\nclaims of deceit, negligent misrepresentation, and violations\nof  Massachusetts consumer protection  laws, such  claims are\nsimilarly barred by Langley.\n                           \n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nineffectively  are deemed waived.   E.g., In  re: Nelson, No.\n                                                        \n\n92-2408, slip op. at 8 n.6 (1st Cir. June 3, 1993).  \n\n          In sum,  even  if Weinhold's  warranty  claims  are\n\nvalid, they are nonetheless based solely on FADC-IV's written\n\nwarranty of GVW's  work.  As such, they amount  to set-off or\n\nrecoupment claims, rather than defenses to his obligations on\n\nthe note and guarantee.  Thus, they do not preclude the entry\n\nof summary judgment  in favor of the FDIC  for enforcement of\n\nthe note and guarantee.\n\nC.  Weinhold's Warranty Claims Against FADC-IV\n                                              \n\n          Relying on Howell v. Continental Credit Corp.,  655\n                                                       \n\nF.2d  743,  746 (7th  Cir.  1981) and  its  progeny, Weinhold\n\nargues that his breach of warranty claims survive D'Oench due\n                                                         \n\nto the fact  that they are based on  documents which evidence\n\nbilateral  obligations.

The bank counterclaimed, seeking payment from Weinhold of a facially unqualified promissory note and personal guarantee.   After the bank failed, the FDIC, in its capacity as receiver, removed the proceedings to federal court, and sought summary enforcement of the note and guarantee.   The district court granted the FDIC's motion for summary judgment on the note, and, in the same order, dismissed Weinhold's warranty claims against the bank's subsidiary.   We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The corporate affiliations of the relevant parties are complex, so we begin by tracing them in some detail.   First American Bank for Savings (\"First American\"), a federally insured savings bank, owned several subsidiary corporations which were engaged in the development of real estate projects in the Boston area.   One such wholly-owned subsidiary, First American Development Corporation IV (\"FADC-IV\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> formed a joint venture with H &amp; P Associates Limited Partnership II (\"H &amp; P\").   The joint venture, known as Commonwealth-Marlboro Associates (\"CMA\"), acquired an apartment building at 225 Commonwealth Avenue (\"the property\") in Boston, with the intention of converting the property to residential condominiums.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  CMA hired GVW, Inc.  (\"GVW\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of H &amp; P, as general contractor for renovation work on the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During April 1986, Weinhold and Leslie Levy<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> became interested in buying the property from CMA.   To that end, they formed 225 Commonwealth Trust (\"the Trust\").   On June 30, 1986, Weinhold, on behalf of the Trust, bought the property from CMA.   GVW had not yet completed renovations to the property, and under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement between CMA and Weinhold, the work of completing the renovations was left to GVW.   Among other terms, the purchase and sale agreement included the following paragraph:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>[CMA] and [GVW] shall enter into a supplementary agreement with [Weinhold] warranting, in favor of [Weinhold]:  (a) the construction of the improvements constituting the Project for a period of one (1) year after the Project is [s]ubstantially [c]ompleted, and (b) the structural improvements at the [property] related to the Project for a period of five (5) years after the Project is [s]ubstantially [c]ompleted.   The warranties set forth in such side agreement shall survive the Closing Date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 3, 1986, in compliance with this contractual provision, CMA executed a document in which it warranted GVW's work on the property.   Because FADC-IV was a joint venturer in CMA, both the purchase and sale agreement and the September 3, 1986, warranty were executed by officers of FADC-IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to purchasing the property from CMA, Weinhold also obtained financing for his purchase of the property through First American, FADC-IV's parent company, borrowing $2.4 million from First American.   The loan was evidenced by a promissory note signed by Weinhold in the amount of $2.4 million, and repayment was secured by Weinhold's personal guarantee and by a first mortgage on the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the sale, disputes arose between Weinhold and GVW regarding the completion of the renovations.   As a result, Weinhold terminated GVW as general contractor.   In June of 1987, based on GVW's failure to properly complete the required renovations, Weinhold brought suit in Massachusetts's Suffolk County Superior Court against FADC-IV, H &amp; P and GVW alleging, inter alia, breach of contract and breach of warranty by all defendants.   Foremost among Weinhold's claims was his allegation that the renovations did not comply with relevant zoning provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weinhold subsequently added First American as a defendant, arguing that FADC-IV was an alter ego of First American.   In essence, Weinhold argued that First American was liable for FADC-IV's actions, including FADC-IV's warranty of GVW's renovation work.   First American counterclaimed, alleging that Weinhold had failed to make mortgage payments.   First American sought payment of the note and enforcement of Weinhold's guarantee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 19, 1990, First American was declared insolvent and the FDIC was appointed receiver.   The FDIC removed the case to federal district court, and sought summary judgment on the note and guarantee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In granting the FDIC's motion for summary judgment, the district court ruled that Weinhold had failed to offer proof of any defense to payment on the note and guarantee sufficient to satisfy the requisites of  D'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. v. FDIC, 315 U.S. 447, 62 S.Ct. 676, 86 L.Ed. 956 (1942).   In a second ruling, the court dismissed the breach of warranty claims that had originally been brought against FADC-IV.   The court reasoned that Weinhold's warranty claims against FADC-IV, like his defenses to the FDIC's counterclaim, failed to satisfy the demands of the D'Oench doctrine.   Upon review, we affirm both rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of summary judgments is plenary.  Rivera-Ruiz v. Gonzalez-Rivera, 983 F.2d 332, 333-34 (1st Cir.1993).  \"[W]e read the record and indulge all inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\"  Id. at 334.   Summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Id. at 333.   Moreover, we are free to affirm a district court's ruling \"on any ground supported in the record even if the issue was not pleaded, tried or otherwise referred to in the proceeding below.\"  De Casenave v. United States, 991 F.2d 11, 12 n. 2 (1st Cir.1993) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>B. Weinhold's Defenses to Payment of the Note</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contending that the district court improperly granted the FDIC's motion for summary judgment, Weinhold has done no more than press his affirmative warranty claims.   The bulk of Weinhold's appellate brief is dedicated to arguing that his warranty claims against First American survive both D'Oench and 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1823(e), which has been loosely described as D'Oench 's codification.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Apparently, Weinhold assumes that a viable breach of warranty claim, based on CMA's written warranty of GVW's construction work, would excuse payment on the promissory note.   Because Weinhold's assumption in this regard is erroneous, we need not linger long over this argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The possibility of valid set-off or recoupment claims does not preclude the summary enforcement of debt instruments.   See, e.g., Hunt v. Bankers Trust Co., 689 F.Supp. 666, 672 (N.D.Tex.1987).   Weinhold's breach of warranty claims are no more than set-off or recoupment claims.   They involve issues of zoning, workmanship and other matters relating to GVW's work on the renovation project, rather than issues of liability between Weinhold and First American on the note and guarantee.   Even were we to disregard FADC-IV's corporate form, as we are repeatedly urged to do by Weinhold, we would find, at most, that First American and Weinhold entered two separate agreements.   The agreement regarding the loan of $2.4 million, on one hand, is evidenced by the note, the mortgage and the personal guarantee.   FADC-IV's obligation to convey title to Weinhold and to warrant GVW's work, on the other hand, arises out of the entirely separate purchase and sale agreement.   Simply put, GVW's allegedly unacceptable workmanship does not relieve Weinhold of his obligations under the note and guarantee.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Cf. Koch v. Koch, 903 F.2d 1333, 1335 (10th Cir.1990) (affirming summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs in real estate transaction notwithstanding defendant's claims based on separate stock transaction executed between the same parties on the same day);  Exchange Nat'l Bank of Chicago v. Daniels, 768 F.2d 140, 143 (7th Cir.1985) (affirming summary judgment on claim for payment of facially unconditional note where defendant's allegations did not constitute a defense to payment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that Weinhold's appeal raises any defenses other than his mistaken reliance on his affirmative warranty claims, it does so in an ineffective manner.   This court has often warned litigants that issues raised ineffectively are deemed waived.   E.g., In re Nelson, 994 F.2d 42, 45 n. 6 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, even if Weinhold's warranty claims are valid, they are nonetheless based solely on FADC-IV's written warranty of GVW's work.   As such, they amount to set-off or recoupment claims, rather than defenses to his obligations on the note and guarantee.   Thus, they do not preclude the entry of summary judgment in favor of the FDIC for enforcement of the note and guarantee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>C. Weinhold's Warranty Claims Against FADC-IV</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on Howell v. Continental Credit Corp., 655 F.2d 743, 746 (7th Cir.1981) and its progeny, Weinhold argues that his breach of warranty claims survive D'Oench due to the fact that they are based on documents which evidence bilateral obligations.   See, e.g., id.  (holding that neither D'Oench nor &#167; 1823(e) apply \"where the document the FDIC seeks to enforce is one ... which facially manifests bilateral obligations and serves as the basis of the lessee's defense\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weinhold's reliance on Howell is misplaced.   In the various cases employing the Howell exception, or similar reasoning, the claims or defenses which the non-governmental party seeks to enforce are contained either in the very instrument which the governmental party seeks to enforce, see, e.g., Howell, 655 F.2d at 747 (holding that when \"the asset upon which the FDIC is attempting to recover is the very same agreement that the makers allege has been breached by the FDIC's assignors, &#167; 1823(e) does not apply\");  FDIC v. Panelfab Puerto Rico, Inc., 739 F.2d 26, 30 (1st Cir.1984) (holding that the FDIC may not invoke &#167; 1823(e) to invalidate claims which arise from \"the same agreement on which the FDIC brought the action in the first place\");  FDIC v. Aetna Casualty and Sur. Co., 947 F.2d 196, 206-07 (6th Cir.1991) (applying Howell's reasoning to defenses contained in bilateral bond agreement which FDIC sought to enforce);  or they are contained in closely related, or \"integral\" loan documents.   See Resolution Trust Corp. v. Oaks Apartments Joint Venture, 966 F.2d 995, 1000-01 (5th Cir.1992) (applying Howell exception to a liability limitation clause contained in loan guarantee);  FDIC v. Laguarta, 939 F.2d 1231, 1238-39 (5th Cir.1991) (applying Howell-type rationale to a loan agreement and modification agreement that were \"integral to the loan transaction\");  Baumann v. Savers Fed.  Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 934 F.2d 1506, 1517-18 (11th Cir.1991) (applying Howell exception to claims based on a \"schedule dictated in the loan documents\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1936, 118 L.Ed.2d 543 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that Weinhold argues that the purchase and sale agreement in this case is an integral part of Weinhold's financing arrangements, we disagree.   Thus, even were we to disregard FADC-IV's status as a corporation separate from its parent, First American, we are still left with two distinct agreements, one which governs the purchase and renovation of the property, and the other which governs the financing thereof.   Cf. Cardente v. Fleet Bank of Maine, Inc., 796 F.Supp. 603, 612-13 (D.Me.1992) (declining to apply Howell exception to plaintiff's claims arising from a lease between plaintiffs and failed bank where FDIC sought enforcement of a promissory note and mortgage on the leased property which were facially unrelated to the lease).   Accordingly, the Howell exception to D'Oench does not apply to Weinhold's claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Given that Weinhold offers no other basis for challenging the district court's dismissal of his warranty claims, we affirm that dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of the FDIC and dismissing Weinhold's breach of warranty claims is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

The district court granted the FDIC's motion for summary judgment on the note, and, in the same order, dismissed Weinhold's warranty claims against the bank's subsidiary.   We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The corporate affiliations of the relevant parties are complex, so we begin by tracing them in some detail.   First American Bank for Savings (\"First American\"), a federally insured savings bank, owned several subsidiary corporations which were engaged in the development of real estate projects in the Boston area.   One such wholly-owned subsidiary, First American Development Corporation IV (\"FADC-IV\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> formed a joint venture with H &amp; P Associates Limited Partnership II (\"H &amp; P\").   The joint venture, known as Commonwealth-Marlboro Associates (\"CMA\"), acquired an apartment building at 225 Commonwealth Avenue (\"the property\") in Boston, with the intention of converting the property to residential condominiums.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  CMA hired GVW, Inc.  (\"GVW\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of H &amp; P, as general contractor for renovation work on the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During April 1986, Weinhold and Leslie Levy<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> became interested in buying the property from CMA.   To that end, they formed 225 Commonwealth Trust (\"the Trust\").   On June 30, 1986, Weinhold, on behalf of the Trust, bought the property from CMA.   GVW had not yet completed renovations to the property, and under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement between CMA and Weinhold, the work of completing the renovations was left to GVW.   Among other terms, the purchase and sale agreement included the following paragraph:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>[CMA] and [GVW] shall enter into a supplementary agreement with [Weinhold] warranting, in favor of [Weinhold]:  (a) the construction of the improvements constituting the Project for a period of one (1) year after the Project is [s]ubstantially [c]ompleted, and (b) the structural improvements at the [property] related to the Project for a period of five (5) years after the Project is [s]ubstantially [c]ompleted.   The warranties set forth in such side agreement shall survive the Closing Date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 3, 1986, in compliance with this contractual provision, CMA executed a document in which it warranted GVW's work on the property.   Because FADC-IV was a joint venturer in CMA, both the purchase and sale agreement and the September 3, 1986, warranty were executed by officers of FADC-IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to purchasing the property from CMA, Weinhold also obtained financing for his purchase of the property through First American, FADC-IV's parent company, borrowing $2.4 million from First American.   The loan was evidenced by a promissory note signed by Weinhold in the amount of $2.4 million, and repayment was secured by Weinhold's personal guarantee and by a first mortgage on the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the sale, disputes arose between Weinhold and GVW regarding the completion of the renovations.   As a result, Weinhold terminated GVW as general contractor.   In June of 1987, based on GVW's failure to properly complete the required renovations, Weinhold brought suit in Massachusetts's Suffolk County Superior Court against FADC-IV, H &amp; P and GVW alleging, inter alia, breach of contract and breach of warranty by all defendants.   Foremost among Weinhold's claims was his allegation that the renovations did not comply with relevant zoning provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weinhold subsequently added First American as a defendant, arguing that FADC-IV was an alter ego of First American.   In essence, Weinhold argued that First American was liable for FADC-IV's actions, including FADC-IV's warranty of GVW's renovation work.   First American counterclaimed, alleging that Weinhold had failed to make mortgage payments.   First American sought payment of the note and enforcement of Weinhold's guarantee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 19, 1990, First American was declared insolvent and the FDIC was appointed receiver.   The FDIC removed the case to federal district court, and sought summary judgment on the note and guarantee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In granting the FDIC's motion for summary judgment, the district court ruled that Weinhold had failed to offer proof of any defense to payment on the note and guarantee sufficient to satisfy the requisites of  D'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103624\"><a href=\"/opinion/103624/doench-duhme-co-v-fdic/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103624\"><a href=\"/opinion/103624/doench-duhme-co-v-fdic/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">956</span> </a></span>(1942).   In a second ruling, the court dismissed the breach of warranty claims that had originally been brought against FADC-IV.   The court reasoned that Weinhold's warranty claims against FADC-IV, like his defenses to the FDIC's counterclaim, failed to satisfy the demands of the D'Oench doctrine.

Weinhold's Defenses to Payment of the Note</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contending that the district court improperly granted the FDIC's motion for summary judgment, Weinhold has done no more than press his affirmative warranty claims.   The bulk of Weinhold's appellate brief is dedicated to arguing that his warranty claims against First American survive both D'Oench and 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1823(e), which has been loosely described as D'Oench 's codification.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Apparently, Weinhold assumes that a viable breach of warranty claim, based on CMA's written warranty of GVW's construction work, would excuse payment on the promissory note.   Because Weinhold's assumption in this regard is erroneous, we need not linger long over this argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The possibility of valid set-off or recoupment claims does not preclude the summary enforcement of debt instruments.   See, e.g., Hunt v. Bankers Trust Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1890871\"><a href=\"/opinion/1890871/hunt-v-bankers-trust-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">689</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></a></span>, 672 (N.D.Tex.1987).   Weinhold's breach of warranty claims are no more than set-off or recoupment claims.   They involve issues of zoning, workmanship and other matters relating to GVW's work on the renovation project, rather than issues of liability between Weinhold and First American on the note and guarantee.   Even were we to disregard FADC-IV's corporate form, as we are repeatedly urged to do by Weinhold, we would find, at most, that First American and Weinhold entered two separate agreements.   The agreement regarding the loan of $2.4 million, on one hand, is evidenced by the note, the mortgage and the personal guarantee.   FADC-IV's obligation to convey title to Weinhold and to warrant GVW's work, on the other hand, arises out of the entirely separate purchase and sale agreement.   Simply put, GVW's allegedly unacceptable workmanship does not relieve Weinhold of his obligations under the note and guarantee.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Cf. Koch v. Koch, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542023\"><a href=\"/opinion/542023/charles-g-koch-and-david-h-koch-v-william-i-koch/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1333</span></a></span>, 1335 (10th Cir.1990) (affirming summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs in real estate transaction notwithstanding defendant's claims based on separate stock transaction executed between the same parties on the same day);  Exchange Nat'l Bank of Chicago v.

This court has often warned litigants that issues raised ineffectively are deemed waived.   E.g., In re Nelson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607858\"><a href=\"/opinion/607858/bankr-l-rep-p-75285-in-re-mark-nelson-debtor-mark-nelson-v-linda/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 45 n. 6 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, even if Weinhold's warranty claims are valid, they are nonetheless based solely on FADC-IV's written warranty of GVW's work.   As such, they amount to set-off or recoupment claims, rather than defenses to his obligations on the note and guarantee.   Thus, they do not preclude the entry of summary judgment in favor of the FDIC for enforcement of the note and guarantee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>C.

As we understand it, this contention is aimed solely at showing that Weinhold's affirmative warranty claims survive D'Oench and &#167; 1823(e)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> To the extent that the issue of GVW's workmanship could ever provide a defense to payment of the note, it could only constitute a defense of fraud in the inducement, a defense which Weinhold raised in state court.   However, the Supreme Court has made clear that &#167; 1823(e) precludes the defense of fraud in the inducement where the FDIC is suing on a facially unqualified promissory note.   See Langley v.
