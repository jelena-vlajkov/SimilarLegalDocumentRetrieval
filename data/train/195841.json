Having heard oral  argument, and read\r                                \n\nthe parties' briefs and the record, we affirm the judgment of\n\nthe district court.

FDIC, 315 U.S.  447 (1942), the district court's  analysis\r                   \n\nof that issue is plainly correct.  See also FDIC v.

We find nothing  convincing in\n\nappellants'  arguments  based  on   the  purported  lack   of\n\nconsideration to  Monterrey.  Monterrey was  not incorporated\n\nat the relevant time, and lack of consideration is unavailing\n\nfor other reasons set out by appellee.  \n\n          Nor,  viewing the summary  judgment materials  in a\n\nlight most favorable to plaintiff,  do we find anything  that\n\ncould overcome  the presumption of liability  of the conjugal\n\npartnership.   Mr. Pou's alleged reservations  on this score,\n\nsupposedly  made verbally to agents of the failed bank, could\n\nnot accomplish this for present purposes.  While Mrs. Pou did\n\nnot sign the  note, the conjugal  partnership was liable  for\n\nthe  debts and obligations of either  of its members.  As one\n\npartner,  Mrs.  Pou stood  to benefit  from  use of  the loan\n\nproceeds  to reduce  her husband's  debt unless  it  could be\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ndemonstrated, for some reason,  that that particular debt was\n\nbeyond the  joint and  several liability of  the partnership.\n\nEvidence showing this is  lacking.  See FDIC v.  Perez Perez,\r                                                                        \n\n637  F.

No reason is suggested that the stock\n\nshould be deemed  to belong  to Mr.  Pou exclusively,  rather\n\nthan forming part of  the pool of assets within  the conjugal\n\npartnership and belonging to both spouses.  If so, the use of\n\nloan proceeds to pay Mi Tacita's debt and to whatever extent,\n\nenhance the value of its  stock, benefited both partners, not\n\njust Mr. Pou alone.\n\n          We  have considered appellants' other arguments and\n\nare satisfied that the judgment below was correctly rendered.\n\n          Affirmed.
