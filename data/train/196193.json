Van\r                                                                              \r\nVliet, Chief, and Lena Watkins,  Attorney, Criminal Division, Narcotic\r                                      \r\nand  Dangerous Drug  Section,  Department  of  Justice, on  brief  for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                        July 20, 1995\r\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.   Petitioner Pedro Soto-Alvarez  appeals the\r                           \r\n\ndismissal  by  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the\r\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico of  his motion to vacate his sentence\r\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C.   2255.  Petitioner raises three claims\r\n\non appeal.\r\n\n     First, Soto-Alvarez alleges that he received ineffective\r\n\nassistance of counsel because his counsel previously had been\r\n\nhired  by Jose Panzardi Alvarez to represent Panzardi's wife,\r\n\nGloria Nieves, when she and Panzardi pled guilty to violating\r\n\nthe  civil rights of  a government informant  by killing him.\r\n\nPanzardi  and Nieves, along with Soto-Alvarez and others, had\r\n\nbeen members  of an organization involved in  the shipment of\r\n\ndrugs from Colombia to Puerto Rico.  After pleading guilty to\r\n\nkilling  the informant, Panzardi and Nieves agreed to testify\r\n\nagainst  members of  their own  organization.   According  to\r\n\nSoto-Alvarez, his counsel's  divided loyalties kept him  from\r\n\neffectively cross-examining Panzardi in regard to  Panzardi's\r\n\ntestimony that he  and Soto-Alvarez had traveled  together to\r\n\nVenezuela   to  purchase  heroin  and  cocaine.    Panzardi's\r\n\npassport failed to reveal any travel to Venezuela at the time\r\n\nin  question.     Soto-Alvarez  also  asserts   that  divided\r\n\nloyalties  prevented  his  counsel  from  effectively  cross-\r\n\nexamining  Panzardi and Nieves as to  their prior records and\r\n\ntheir  agreement to cooperate  with government.   Such cross-\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nexamination would, in Soto-Alvarez' view, have undermined the\r\n\ncredibility of Panzardi and Nieves.\r\n\n     To show an entitlement to relief, Soto-Alvarez must show\r\n\nthat his  counsel failed  to pursue  a plausible  alternative\r\n\ndefense strategy because of divided loyalties.  United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Garcia-Rosa, 876  F.2d 209,  231  (1st Cir.  1989).   The\r                           \r\n\nrecord  reveals that,  while Soto-Alvarez's  counsel did  not\r\n\ncross-examine Panzardi  about  the  discrepancy  between  his\r\n\ntestimony  and his passport  stamp, counsel did  impeach that\r\n\ntestimony, during  closing  argument, by  calling the  jury's\r\n\nattention  to  the  passport, which  had  been  introduced as\r\n\nevidence,  and its apparent conflict with Panzardi's account.\r\n\nAs  to the  prior records  of Panzardi  and Nieves  and their\r\n\ncooperation with  the government,  this court  has previously\r\n\nfound  that both  Panzardi  and  Nieves were  \"cross-examined\r\n\nthoroughly\" by counsel  for Soto-Alvarez's codefendants, that\r\n\nthe jury was made aware of their involvement in the murder of\r\n\nthe informant, and that their credibility had been \"more than\r\n\nsufficiently explored.\"  Garcia-Rosa, 876 F.2d at 237 &amp; n.23.\r                                                \r\n\nTherefore, further  cross-examination  of  the  witnesses  by\r\n\ncounsel for Soto-Alvarez  on these issues would  largely have\r\n\nbeen  cumulative.   Since Soto-Alvarez  has  not alleged  any\r\n\nspecific details  as to the  conduct of  Panzardi and  Nieves\r\n\nwhich  were not explored at trial, he  has failed to show the\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nexistence  of an alternative  defense strategy which  was not\r\n\npursued at trial.\r\n\n     Soto-Alvarez also alleges  that he received  ineffective\r\n\nassistance of counsel because counsel failed to advise him of\r\n\nhis right to  testify in his own  behalf.  Even if  we assume\r\n\narguendo that the  bare allegation is sufficient to show that\r                    \r\n\ncounsel   had  been   constitutionally  deficient,   but  see\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnderwood v.  Clark, 939  F.2d 473,  475-76  (7th Cir.  1991)\r                               \r\n\n(\"barebones assertion\" that attorney told client he could not\r\n\ntestify  insufficient,  absent  \"greater  particularity,\"  to\r\n\nnecessitate  evidentiary  hearing), Soto-Alvarez  still  must\r\n\nshow  a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's error,\r\n\nthe  result  of  the proceeding  would  have  been different.\r\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984).   \r                                    \r\n\n     Soto-Alvarez  alleges that,  if allowed  to testify,  he\r\n\nwould have  refuted Panzardi's  testimony as  to the  alleged\r\n\ntrip to Venezuela  to purchase drugs.   However, Soto-Alvarez\r\n\nhas failed  to show  either that, if  allowed to  testify, he\r\n\nwould have brought  to the jurors' attention  any information\r\n\nof which  they were not  already aware or how  that testimony\r\n\nwould  have made  it  reasonably  probable that  Soto-Alvarez\r\n\nwould not have been convicted on the  charges for which he is\r\n\nnow imprisoned.  First, as already noted, the  discrepancy in\r\n\nPanzardi's  account of  the trip  was brought  to  the jury's\r\n\nattention.  Moreover, the evidence  of the trip went to prove\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nthat Panzardi and  Soto-Alvarez were members of  a conspiracy\r\n\nto possess with  intent to distribute cocaine  and heroin and\r\n\nSoto-Alvarez' conviction on the conspiracy charge has already\r\n\nbeen reversed.  United States  v. Soto-Alvarez, 958 F.2d 473,\r                                                          \r\n\n478 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 113 S.Ct. 221  (1992).  Third,\r                                         \r\n\nthere  was sufficient evidence  of Soto-Alvarez' guilt  as to\r\n\nthe other charges on which  he was convicted without  relying\r\n\non  the  fact  that he  and  Panzardi  traveled  to Venezuela\r\n\ntogether.  Id.  \r                         \r\n\n     Soto-Alvarez'  final   claim  is  that   the  government\r\n\nbreached  its 1985  plea agreement  with  him by  introducing\r\n\nevidence from the dismissed counts  at his 1986 trial.  Since\r\n\nthis   alleged   error    is   neither   constitutional   nor\r\n\njurisdictional, Soto-Alvarez  is entitled  to relief  only if\r\n\nthe  error   was  \"a  fundamental  defect   which  inherently\r\n\nresult[ed] in a complete miscarriage of justice.\"   Knight v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nUnited States, 37 F.3d 769, 772 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting Hill\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. United States, 368 U.S. 424, 428 (1962)).  \r                            \r\n\n     According to  the 1985  plea  agreement, the  government\r\n\nagreed  not to charge  Soto-Alvarez with the  possession with\r\n\nintent  to distribute 283  grams of cocaine  during September\r\n\n1984.  During  his 1986 trial, Soto-Alvarez  was found guilty\r\n\nof possession with  intent to distribute approximately  seven\r\n\nkilograms of cocaine.  Even  if the 283 grams were improperly\r\n\nincluded within  those seven kilograms,  the jury supportably\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nfound  that,   aside  from  these  283   grams,  Soto-Alvarez\r\n\npossessed with the intent to  distribute almost six and three\r\n\nquarters  kilograms  of  cocaine.    Since  Soto-Alvarez  has\r\n\nprovided no evidence that, even  without the inclusion of the\r\n\n283 grams, either the verdict or his sentence would have been\r\n\nany  different, we  find no  miscarriage of  justice  in this\r\n\ncase.  \r\n\n     The  district  court   order  dismissing  Soto-Alvarez's\r\n\npetition is affirmed.\r                                \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n",

United States v. Garcia-Rosa, 876 F.2d 209, 231 (1st Cir.1989).  The record reveals that, while Soto-Alvarez's counsel did not cross- examine Panzardi about the discrepancy between his testimony and his passport stamp, counsel did impeach that testimony, during closing argument, by calling the jury's attention to the passport, which had been introduced as evidence, and its apparent conflict with Panzardi's account.  As to the prior records of Panzardi and Nieves and their cooperation with the government, this court has previously found that both Panzardi and Nieves were \"cross-examined thoroughly\" by counsel for Soto-Alvarez's codefendants, that the jury was made aware of their involvement in the murder of the informant, and that their credibility had been \"more than sufficiently explored.\"  Garcia-Rosa, 876 F.2d at 237 &amp; n.23.  Therefore, further cross- examination of the witnesses by counsel for Soto-Alvarez on these issues would largely have been cumulative.  Since Soto-Alvarez has not alleged any specific details as to the conduct of Panzardi and Nieves which were not explored at trial, he has failed to show the existence of an alternative defense strategy which was not pursued at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto-Alvarez also alleges that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to advise him of his right to testify in his own behalf.  Even if we assume arguendo that the bare allegation is sufficient to show that counsel had been constitutionally deficient, but see Underwood v. Clark, 939 F.2d 473, 475-76 (7th Cir.1991) (\"barebones assertion\" that attorney told client he could not testify insufficient, absent \"greater particularity,\" to necessitate evidentiary hearing), Soto-Alvarez still must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's error, the result of the proceeding would have been different.

First, as already noted, the discrepancy in Panzardi's account of the trip was brought to the jury's attention.  Moreover, the evidence of the trip went to prove that Panzardi and Soto-Alvarez were members of a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and heroin and Soto-Alvarez' conviction on the conspiracy charge has already been reversed.  United States v. Soto-Alvarez, 958 F.2d 473, 478 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S.Ct. 221 (1992).

Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto-Alvarez' final claim is that the government breached its 1985 plea agreement with him by introducing evidence from the dismissed counts at his 1986 trial.  Since this alleged error is neither constitutional nor jurisdictional, Soto-Alvarez is entitled to relief only if the error was \"a fundamental defect which inherently result[ed] in a complete miscarriage of justice.\"  Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d 769, 772 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting Hill v.

Even if the 283 grams were improperly included within those seven kilograms, the jury supportably found that, aside from these 283 grams, Soto-Alvarez possessed with the intent to distribute almost six and three quarters kilograms of cocaine.

The record reveals that, while Soto-Alvarez's counsel did not cross- examine Panzardi about the discrepancy between his testimony and his passport stamp, counsel did impeach that testimony, during closing argument, by calling the jury's attention to the passport, which had been introduced as evidence, and its apparent conflict with Panzardi's account.  As to the prior records of Panzardi and Nieves and their cooperation with the government, this court has previously found that both Panzardi and Nieves were \"cross-examined thoroughly\" by counsel for Soto-Alvarez's codefendants, that the jury was made aware of their involvement in the murder of the informant, and that their credibility had been \"more than sufficiently explored.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524260\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Garcia-Rosa,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/524260/united-states-v-blanca-garcia-rosa-united-states-of-america-v-pedro/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">237</span> </a></span>&amp; n.23.  Therefore, further cross- examination of the witnesses by counsel for Soto-Alvarez on these issues would largely have been cumulative.  Since Soto-Alvarez has not alleged any specific details as to the conduct of Panzardi and Nieves which were not explored at trial, he has failed to show the existence of an alternative defense strategy which was not pursued at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto-Alvarez also alleges that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to advise him of his right to testify in his own behalf.  Even if we assume arguendo that the bare allegation is sufficient to show that counsel had been constitutionally deficient, but see Underwood v. Clark, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"565039\"><a href=\"/opinion/565039/hurley-e-underwood-v-richard-clark-and-attorney-general-of-the-state-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">939</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span>, 475-76 (7th Cir.1991) (\"barebones assertion\" that attorney told client he could not testify insufficient, absent \"greater particularity,\" to necessitate evidentiary hearing), Soto-Alvarez still must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's error, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  Strickland v. Washington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 694 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto-Alvarez alleges that, if allowed to testify, he would have refuted Panzardi's testimony as to the alleged trip to Venezuela to purchase drugs.  However, Soto-Alvarez has failed to show either that, if allowed to testify, he would have brought to the jurors' attention any information of which they were not already aware or how that testimony would have made it reasonably probable that Soto-Alvarez would not have been convicted on the charges for which he is now imprisoned.  First, as already noted, the discrepancy in Panzardi's account of the trip was brought to the jury's attention.  Moreover, the evidence of the trip went to prove that Panzardi and Soto-Alvarez were members of a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and heroin and Soto-Alvarez' conviction on the conspiracy charge has already been reversed.  United States v. Soto-Alvarez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579199\"><a href=\"/opinion/579199/united-states-v-pedro-soto-alvarez-united-states-of-america-v-pedro/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span>, 478 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span> </span>(1992).  Third, there was sufficient evidence of Soto-Alvarez' guilt as to the other charges on which he was convicted without relying on the fact that he and Panzardi traveled to Venezuela together.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto-Alvarez' final claim is that the government breached its 1985 plea agreement with him by introducing evidence from the dismissed counts at his 1986 trial.  Since this alleged error is neither constitutional nor jurisdictional, Soto-Alvarez is entitled to relief only if the error was \"a fundamental defect which inherently result[ed] in a complete miscarriage of justice.\"  Knight v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195690\"><a href=\"/opinion/195690/knight-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">769</span></a></span>, 772 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting Hill v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106329\"><a href=\"/opinion/106329/hill-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span>, 428 (1962)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the 1985 plea agreement, the government agreed not to charge Soto-Alvarez with the possession with intent to distribute 283 grams of cocaine during September 1984.  During his 1986 trial, Soto-Alvarez was found guilty of possession with intent to distribute approximately seven kilograms of cocaine.  Even if the 283 grams were improperly included within those seven kilograms, the jury supportably found that, aside from these 283 grams, Soto-Alvarez possessed with the intent to distribute almost six and three quarters kilograms of cocaine.  Since Soto-Alvarez has provided no evidence that, even without the inclusion of the 283 grams, either the verdict or his sentence would have been any different, we find no miscarriage of justice in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court order dismissing Soto-Alvarez's petition is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
