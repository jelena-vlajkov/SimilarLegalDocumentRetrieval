Curran,  Assistant United States Attorney,  with\r\nwhom Sheldon Whitehouse, United States Attorney, James H. Leavey,\r\nAssistant \r                   United States Attorney, and Kenneth P. Madden, Assistant\r\nUnited States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\r\n                                          \r\n\n                          July 3, 1997\r\n                                          \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.  Appellant was convicted, after a jury trial, of\r\n\nparticipating  in the  collection of  an extension  of credit  by\r\n\nextortionate \r                      means, \r                            in \r                               violation of 18 U.S.C. SS 894, 2.  He raises\r\n\nthree issues on appeal.  At this juncture, after a hard and  ably\r\n\nfought trial below, no issue merits extended discussion.\r\n\n     Appellant first challenges the sufficiency of the  evidence.\r\n\nThe \r             evidence \r                      as the jury could have found it was that (1) Duxbury,\r\n\nthe \r             key \r                government \r                           witness, was confronted by co-defendant Ouimette\r\n\nand \r             accused \r                     of \r                       shaking \r                               down a friend; (2) Duxbury's response earned\r\n\nhim a beating by a third defendant, Gellerman, who pleaded guilty\r\n\nand \r             testified as a cooperating witness at trial; (3) Ouimette then\r\n\ngrabbed Duxbury by the  throat and announced that, as a  penalty,\r\n\nDuxbury must pay $5,000  by the following night; (4) after  this,\r\n\nOuimette slapped Duxbury in the face and appellant kicked Duxbury\r\n\nin the  leg; and  (5) most importantly,  just before Duxbury  was\r\n\nescorted out of the room, appellant raised his hand, and pointing\r\n\nat \r            Duxbury, \r                     said, \r                          \"Do \r                              not forget the five thousand dollars tomorrow\r\n\nnight.\"\r\n\n     Appellant \r                        asserted flaws and inconsistencies in the testimony\r\n\nof the various witnesses, but this comes down to a question as to\r\n\nwhich \r               witness \r                       the \r                          jury \r                               believed.  There is nothing to set this case\r\n\napart from the general deference due a jury's verdict.  Not  only\r\n\nwas there  Duxbury's unshaken testimony,  but the  jury also  had\r\n\nbefore  it nonverbal  evidence  of  appellant's  kicks  following\r\n\nOuimette's announcement of the penalty.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n     The second issue  is whether the  district court abused  its\r\n\ndiscretion by refusing  the defense a  continuance to obtain  the\r\n\ntestimony \r                   of \r                      a \r                       polygraph \r                                 examiner whose testing allegedly supported\r\n\nappellant's assertion that he had not reminded Duxbury about  the\r\n\n$5,000.  The colloquy below and the briefs on appeal discuss many\r\n\nfacets of polygraph test admissibility, but we need rely on  only\r\n\none ground particular to this case.\r\n\n     A prior counsel for appellant, before his removal to avoid a\r\n\nconflict based on representation of a co-defendant, had  obtained\r\n\nthe  test from  his expert.   The  attorney had  proposed to  the\r\n\ngovernment that  it secure  an impartial  examiner to  administer\r\n\nanother test,  \"provided that you agree  that the results of  the\r\n\npolygraph \r                   examination will be admitted at the trial of this matter\r\n\non the  issue of  Mr. Raposa's credibility,  should he choose  to\r\n\ntestify at trial.\"  (Emphasis added.)  As it happened,  appellant\r\n\ndecided not to testify  and the precondition to admission of  the\r\n\nresults of the examination therefore did not materialize.\r\n\n     Under \r                    these \r                          circumstances, we cannot fault the district court\r\n\nfor \r             refusing \r                      a mid-trial continuance for the defense to locate the\r\n\nexpert \r                so \r                   that \r                       he \r                          could \r                                attempt to justify admission of his report.\r\n\nIndeed, \r                 we \r                   read \r                        appellant's brief on appeal as implicitly conceding\r\n\nthis with  the following  language:   \"In the  present case,  the\r\n\npolygraph evidence  would  directly corroborate  the  defendant's\r\n\ntestimony, if he chose to testify, regarding specific fact  [sic]\r\n\nalleged by the government  and denied by the defendant which  the\r\n\njury \r              must \r                   determine . . . .\"   It is also worthy of note that this\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nlanguage \r                  is \r                     identical to that used in a \"Motion to Admit Polygraph\r\n\nEvidence\" \r                   filed \r                         in \r                           the \r                               district court by appellant's trial counsel.\r\n\n     The third issue  concerns the court's refusal to strike  the\r\n\ntestimony  of a dancer  who stated that  appellant had asked  her\r\n\n\"something like, are you a cop  or something.\"  She was not  sure\r\n\nthat  this was  said on  the  day after  the basic  incident  and\r\n\nappellant's \r                     counsel moved to strike on the ground that the witness\r\n\ndid not remember on which day the statement was made.  The  court\r\n\nallowed \r                 the \r                     testimony to stand, saying that its weight was for the\r\n\njury.\r\n\n     We \r                 cannot \r                        say \r                           that \r                                this \r                                     was an abuse of discretion.  There was\r\n\nno objection that this was impermissible character evidence,  nor\r\n\ndid this undercut appellant's defense that he did not participate\r\n\nin an extortionate activity (as opposed to some type of  criminal\r\n\nactivity, such as an assault).\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\n",
