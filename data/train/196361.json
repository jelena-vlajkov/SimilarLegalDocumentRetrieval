We\r\n\naffirm, substantially for the reasons relied upon by the district\r\n\ncourt.  See  Hurley v.  Bureau of Prisons,  No. 94-10966-RCL  (D.\r                                                   \r\n\nMass. May 18, 1995). \r\n\n          In July  1990, Hurley  was convicted of  defrauding the\r\n\nUnited States, see  18 U.S.C.    371, and sentenced to  an eight-\r                            \r\n\nmonth term of  confinement.  Although  the sentence exceeded  the\r\n\nsix-month maximum, see  18 U.S.C.   3651  (repealed 1987), Hurley\r                                \r\n\ndid  not appeal the sentence.  This court affirmed his conviction\r\n\nin United States v.  Hurley, 957 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\r                                                                          \r\n\n113 S. Ct. 60 (1992).  \r\n\n          Shortly after Hurley began serving his term of confine-\r\n\nment  in May 1992, the Bureau noted that the eight-month sentence\r\n\nexceeded the  statutory maximum, whereupon it  advised Hurley and\r\n\ntelephoned the Assistant United  States Attorney (\"AUSA\") who had\r\n\ntried  the case.   Although  both the  AUSA and  Hurley's counsel\r\n\npromptly  moved to  correct  the sentence,  the sentencing  court\r\n\ndenied both motions.  In addition, pending appeal of the district\r\n\ncourt order  denying Hurley's  requests to correct  the sentence,\r\n\nthe  Bureau declined Hurley's request that he be allowed to serve\r\n\nthe last two months  of his prison term in  a halfway house.   As\r\n\ngrounds  therefor,  the Bureau  cited  the  PSR's description  of\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nHurley's  money  laundering activities  (i.e.,  in  excess of  $5\r\n\nmillion), to which no objection had been asserted by Hurley.  \r\n\n          On October 14, 1992, this court vacated the eight-month\r\n\nsentence  and directed  Hurley's immediate  release.   See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.  Hurley, No. 92-2125 (1st Cir. Oct. 14, 1995).  By that\r                           \r\n\ntime, however, he had already served seventeen days more than the\r\n\nsix-month maximum term.\r\n\n          Hurley sued  the Bureau  for damages under  the Privacy\r\n\nAct,  which requires  federal agencies  \"to maintain  all records\r\n\nwhich  are used by the  agency in making  any determination about\r\n\nany individual  with  such accuracy,  relevance, timeliness,  and\r\n\ncompleteness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the\r\n\nindividual in the determination.\"  5 U.S.C.   552a(e)(5).  Hurley\r\n\nalleged that the Bureau wrongfully  relied on the district  court\r\n\njudgment imposing the eight-month  sentence, knowing the sentence\r\n\nto be \"inaccurate,\" and that the  Bureau had failed to follow its\r\n\nown internal  procedures for  reporting illegal sentences  to the\r\n\nAUSA.  These  contentions were properly rejected  by the district\r\n\ncourt.\r\n\n          The  district court  judgment accurately  reflected the\r\n\nsentence imposed by the  sentencing court, and the Bureau  had no\r\n\nobligation     indeed no right    to disregard the sentence until\r\n\nthe  sentencing  court  or  the court  of  appeals  corrected it.\r\n\nSimilarly,  the  claimed  deviation  from  Bureau  procedures    \r\n\nnamely, placing a telephone call to the AUSA, rather than writing\r\n\na  letter    was inconsequential.  At most, any procedural devia-\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\ntion expedited  the correction of Hurley's sentence,  and, in all\r                        \r\n\nevents, it caused Hurley no injury.  Indeed, Hurley concedes that\r                           \r\n\nthe  AUSA promptly moved to correct  the sentence, once notified.\r\n\nNo more was exigible from the Bureau.\r\n\n          Finally, Hurley  alleged that the  Bureau violated  the\r\n\nPrivacy Act by relying on the \"inaccurate\" PSR description of his\r\n\nmoney laundering activities in denying his request for a \"halfway\r\n\nhouse\"  placement.   Hurley neither  objected  to the  PSR before\r\n\nsentencing,  nor on the appeal  from his conviction.   See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.  Hurley, 957  F.2d  1, 4  (1st Cir.  1992).   Any  such\r                           \r\n\ninaccuracy in the PSR  should have been brought to  the attention\r\n\nof the district court  at sentencing; or,  at the very least,  on\r\n\nappeal from his conviction  and sentence.
