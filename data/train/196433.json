Whittum and Cooper, Hall,  Whittum &amp; Shillaber, P.C.  on\r                                                                          \r\nbrief for appellee David Richard Noyes.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Plaintiffs-appellants filed an amended\r                                \r\n\ncomplaint under 42  U.S.C.   1983 alleging violations  of the\r\n\nFirst Amendment,  due process and  equal protection  clauses,\r\n\nall  based on  the  refusal of  the  New Hampshire  Board  of\r\n\nLicensure   to   hold   a  formal   hearing   on  plaintiffs'\r\n\ndisciplinary charges  against defendant Noyes.   The district\r\n\ncourt  dismissed  the  complaint   for  failure  to  state  a\r\n\ncognizable claim.   \r\n\n          Plaintiffs challenge  the court's ruling  that they\r\n\ndid not plead the deprivation of an interest protected by the\r\n\ndue  process clause.   They  say  that the  court erroneously\r\n\nfailed  to recognize  a  constitutional  deprivation  in  the\r\n\nalleged violation of their  state law rights to notice  and a\r\n\nhearing on their disciplinary  complaint against Noyes.  Even\r\n\nif  a protected  interest  could be  identified, however,  an\r\n\nunauthorized deviation from state  procedure does not rise to\r\n\nthe level  of a  constitutional due process  violation unless\r\n\nthe  state  fails  to  provide  a  suitable  post-deprivation\r\n\nremedy.   See Licari v. Ferruzzi, 22  F.3d 344, 348 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1994).   New  Hampshire law  provides  such a  remedy through\r\n\nrehearing and  direct appeal of  Board orders, see  N.H. Rev.\r                                                              \r\n\nStat. Ann.   310-A:71  (1995) (\"Orders of the board  shall be\r\n\nsubject to rehearing  and appeal in the  manner prescribed by\r\n\nRSA 541.\"); N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.    541:1-541:6 (1974 &amp; Supp.\r\n\n1994),  or petition for an extraordinary writ.  See N.H.
