Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                             \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\r                                                      \r\n              Boudin and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\r                                                          \r\n\n                                         \r\n\nRichard Edward Steeves on brief pro se.\r                                  \r\nAndrew  Ketterer,  Attorney  General, and  Diane  Sleek, Assistant\r                                                                   \r\nAttorney General, on brief for appellees.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.  Appellant Richard Steeves, a Maine prisoner\r                           \r\n\nnow incarcerated  in Minnesota, appeals the  grant of summary\r\n\njudgment to  defendant officials  of the Maine  Department of\r\n\nCorrections  on  Steeves' claim  that  defendants denied  him\r\n\nconstitutionally adequate access to Maine courts.  We affirm.\r\n\n     According to  the record, defendants offered  to provide\r\n\nSteeves with  an attorney through Pine  Tree Legal Assistance\r\n\nto assist him in  his post conviction proceedings.   In order\r\n\nto take  advantage of  this offer,  Steeves  was directed  to\r\n\nwrite  to  the  Chief Advocate  of  the  Maine Department  of\r\n\nCorrections.   Instead  of following this  procedure, Steeves\r\n\ncontacted Pine  Tree Legal Assistance directly and apparently\r\n\nsought  legal   assistance  not   for  his   post  conviction\r\n\nproceeding  but for obtaining a  transfer back to  Maine.  He\r\n\nwas  informed by Pine Tree  Legal Assistance that  it did not\r\n\ngenerally handle prison transfer cases.  \r\n\n     The fact that Steeves' failed  in his attempt to  obtain\r\n\nlegal assistance  directly from  Pine  Tree Legal  Assistance\r\n\ndoes  not  indicate  that  such assistance  would  have  been\r\n\nrefused if  Steeves had applied through  the proper channels.\r\n\nSteeves  has therefore  failed to  produce any  evidence that\r\n\ndefendants' offer  to provide  him with legal  assistance was\r\n\nnot genuine.  \r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                               \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n",
