Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Albert B. West on brief for appellant.\r\n   Zechariah Chafee with whom Margaret E. Curran, United States\r\nAttorney, and Kenneth P. Madden, Assistant United States Attorney,\r\nwere on brief for appellee.\r\n\nFebruary 12, 1999\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  Bienvenido Manzueta was indicted\r\nin August 1997 for possession with intent to distribute cocaine. \r\n21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B).  In November 1997, Manzueta pled\r\nguilty pursuant to a written plea agreement, admitting that the\r\nsubstance he had possessed was 57.9 grams of crack cocaine. \r\nThereafter Manzueta was sentenced to 70 months' imprisonment and 5\r\nyears' supervised release and now appeals.\r\nAt sentencing, Manzueta argued to the district judge that\r\ncocaine base--of which crack is the most prominent example--had\r\nnever been scheduled as a controlled substance as provided by 21\r\nU.S.C.  811-12.  However, \"cocaine\" is specifically scheduled as\r\na controlled substance in section 812, sched. II(a)(4).  As we\r\nrecently explained, crack cocaine (a rock-like form) is a type of\r\ncocaine base chemically derived from cocaine hydrochloride\r\n(powdered cocaine) which is itself derived from a natural form of\r\ncocaine base extracted from cocoa leaves.  United States v.\r\nRobinson, 144 F.3d 104, 108 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nWhether as a base or a salt, cocaine is covered by the\r\nstatute; indeed, natural cocaine base--the starting product--shares\r\nthe same chemical make-up as crack.  See Robinson, 144 F.3d at 108. \r\nThe circuit case law is uniform in holding that cocaine base falls\r\nwithin the statutory definition of cocaine.  United States v.\r\nSloan, 97 F.3d 1378, 1381-82 (11th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S.\r\nCt. 2459 (1997); United States v. Deisch, 20 F.3d 139, 150-51 (5th\r\nCir. 1994).  Nothing more needs to be said on this point.\r\nCocaine has been listed as a controlled substance since\r\nthe passage of the original Controlled Substances Act in 1970. \r\nPub. L. No. 91-513,  202, 84 Stat. 1247.  In 1986, Congress\r\namended the statute by introducing separate and far more severe\r\npenalties for \"cocaine base.\"  21 U.S.C.  841(b)(1)(A)(iii),\r\n(b)(1)(B)(iii).  Accordingly, the statute now imposes a penalty for\r\n\"cocaine\" and a separate and higher penalty for \"cocaine base.\" \r\nSince cocaine base is itself a form of cocaine, Manzueta argues on\r\nappeal that on that premise he should be entitled to the lower\r\npenalty under the rule of lenity.\r\nAlthough the government argues that this claim has been\r\nwaived because not fully developed, see United States v. Zannino,\r\n895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082 (1990), we\r\nthink it better to dispose of the claim on the merits to avoid its\r\nrenewal.  The rule of lenity is intended for genuine ambiguity. \r\nReno v. Koray, 515 U.S. 50, 64-65 (1995).  We have every reason to\r\nthink, and Manzueta has provided no basis for doubting, that\r\nCongress meant exactly what it said in 1986 in providing that\r\ndistributors of crack should be subject to an increased penalty.\r\nThe statutory language specifically imposes a higher\r\npenalty for cocaine base, and the legislative history makes clear\r\nthat crack was the target.  Manzueta's contrary position on this\r\nissue has been rejected firmly by other circuits.  E.g., United\r\nStates v. Fields, 113 F.3d 313, 324-25 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 118\r\nS. Ct. 434 (1997); United States v. Sloan, 97 F.3d at 1382; United\r\nStates v. Fisher, 58 F.3d 96, 98-99 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 516\r\nU.S. 927 (1995).  We join these circuits and rest on their\r\nreasoning.\r\nAt oral argument, counsel for Manzueta eloquently argued\r\nthat penalties for crack cocaine are disproportionate and that the\r\ncourt should be ready to take every reasonable opportunity that\r\nwould lead to a sentence for crack cocaine closer or equal to that\r\nthat Congress has provided for powdered cocaine.  Whether the ratio\r\nis fair or not, Congress has spoken with ample clarity, and the\r\nconstitutional challenge to its decision has been regularly\r\nrejected.  See, e.g., Sloan, 97 F.3d at 1383-84; Fisher, 58 F.3d at\r\n99-100.\r\nAffirmed.\n",
