Appellant Santos Huertas Laboy brought\r                                \r\n\na  malpractice action in the United States District Court for\r\n\nthe District  of Puerto Rico against  the physician allegedly\r\n\nresponsible  for  his  mother's  death  and  the  physician's\r\n\ninsurance  company.    The  insurance  company  was  declared\r\n\ninsolvent and its responsibilities  were assumed by appellee,\r\n\nthe Puerto Rico Miscellaneous Insurance Guaranty Association.\r\n\nThe district  court held  that appellant's claim  against the\r\n\ninsurance  company  was  time  barred  because the  insurance\r\n\ncompany  was  not notified  of  the claim  within  the policy\r\n\nperiod.  The physician's insurance policy was a \"claims-made\"\r\n\npolicy which only provides coverage for claims brought to the\r\n\nattention of  the insurer during the duration  of the policy.\r\n\nOn appeal,  appellant argues  that the  claims-made insurance\r\n\npolicy violates  the Fifth  and Fourteenth Amendments  of the\r\n\nUnited States  Constitution  and their  counterparts  in  the\r\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico Constitution. \r\n\n          Because appellant has no fundamental right to bring\r\n\na claim against the physician's insurance company and because\r\n\nthe  claims-made policy  at issue  did  not impair  any other\r\n\nfundamental   right   and   did    not   invoke   a   suspect\r\n\nclassification,  we  apply  a  rational   basis  standard  of\r\n\nscrutiny.1  See  LCM Enters.  v.
