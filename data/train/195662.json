Marshall and Kathleen  B. Rogers, Office  of General\n                                              \nCounsel Harvard University, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n     Per Curiam.  Appellant J. Doe,  a student suspended from\n               \n\nthe Extension School of  appellee Harvard University, filed a\n\ncomplaint   in  June   1993  alleging   that  she   had  been\n\ndiscriminated  against  by  Harvard  because  of  a  learning\n\ndisability  from which  she suffers.   Her  complaint alleged\n\nviolations of the  Civil Rights  Act, 42 U.S.C.    1983,  the\n\nIndividuals with Disabilities Act  [IDEA], 20 U.S.C.    1400-\n\n1485, the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.     701-797b, and the\n\nAmericans with  Disabilities Act  [ADA], 42 U.S.C.     12101-\n\n12213.   She sought injunctive relief in the form of an order\n\ncompelling Harvard  to  reinstate her  as  a student  and  to\n\nrefrain from  other alleged acts  of discrimination.   At the\n\nsame  time,  Doe  also  filed  a  motion  for  a  preliminary\n\ninjunction  seeking  similar  relief.    The  district  court\n\ndismissed the parts of the complaint predicated on  the Civil\n\nRights  Act  and the  IDEA  and granted  summary  judgment to\n\nHarvard on the remaining counts.  The court also denied Doe's\n\nrequest  for a  preliminary injunction.   Later  the district\n\ncourt denied  Doe's motion for reconsideration.   Doe appeals\n\nthe  dismissal  of her  case, the  denial  of her  motion for\n\nreconsideration  and   the  denial  of  her   request  for  a\n\npreliminary injunction.  She also appeals the refusal by  the\n\ndistrict  court  judge  to  recuse  himself.    After  having\n\nreviewed  carefully the  record  in this  case, the  parties'\n\nbriefs, and appellant's numerous filings, we affirm.\n\n                             -3-\n\n     Doe's  claims  pursuant to  Section  1983  of the  Civil\n\nRights  Act and those pursuant to the IDEA were both properly\n\ndismissed.  This  court has previously held  that Harvard \"is\n\nnot a public institution, and is not sufficiently intertwined\n\nwith the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  as to meet the 'state\n\naction' requirement for a    1983 cause of action.\"   Rice v.\n                                                          \n\nPresident  and Fellows of Harvard  College, 663 F.2d 336, 337\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 928 (1982).  The IDEA\n                             \n\n\"provides federal money to assist state and local agencies in\n                                                          \n\neducating handicapped children,  and conditions such  funding\n                              \n\nupon  a   State's  compliance   with   extensive  goals   and\n                 \n\nprocedures.\" Board of Education v.  Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 179\n                                          \n\n(1982) (emphasis added).   The IDEA does not apply  to adults\n\nlike  Doe, see  20 U.S.C.    1412(2)(B)  (children are  those\n              \n\nbetween three and twenty-one years old), nor does it apply to\n\nprivate  institutions like  Harvard, see.  e.g., 20  U.S.C.  \n                                              \n\n1415(a)  (IDEA seeks  to  guarantee \"free  appropriate public\n\neducation\").  \n\n     To prevail  on a  claim under either  the Rehabilitation\n\nAct or the ADA Doe  must show, inter alia, that she  has been\n                                         \n\ndiscriminated  against because  of  her disability.   See  29\n                                                         \n\nU.S.C.    704(a)  (\"no otherwise qualified  individual .  . .\n\nshall, solely  by reason of her  or his disability, .  . . be\n\nsubjected to discrimination\") (Rehabilitation Act); 42 U.S.C.\n\n  12112(a) (\"[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a\n\n                             -4-\n\nqualified  individual  with  a  disability   because  of  the\n\ndisability of  such individual\")  (ADA).  In  its motion  for\n\nsummary  judgment Harvard  presented  sworn affidavits,  with\n\ndocumentary support, which indicated that it had accommodated\n\nDoe's disability to  the full extent recommended  by the only\n\npsychologist  Doe consulted  on  this matter.   Harvard  also\n\npresented   evidence  that   the   other   acts  of   alleged\n\ndiscrimination were taken for  legitimate, non-discriminatory\n\nreasons.  \n\n     In opposition  to the  motion for summary  judgment, Doe\n\nset forth  no specific facts as  required by Fed. R.  Civ. P.\n\n56(e),   but   only   \"'conclusory  allegations,   improbable\n\ninferences, and  unsupported speculation'\" that she  had been\n\nthe victim of discrimination.  Pagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d 343,\n                                              \n\n347 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting Medina-Munoz v.

This  is not sufficient\n  \n\nto  withstand   a  properly  supported   motion  for  summary\n\njudgment.       See also  Wynne  v.  Tufts  Univ.  School  of\n                                                             \n\nMedicine, 976 F.2d 791,  794 (1st Cir. 1992)  (\"evidence that\n        \n\n'is  merely  colorable  or is  not  significantly  probative'\n\ncannot deter summary judgment\")  (quoting Anderson v. Liberty\n                                                             \n\nLobby, Inc.,  477 U.S. 242, 249-50 (1986),  cert. denied, 113\n                                                        \n\nS.Ct. 1845 (1993). \n\n     On appeal, Doe has also raised several other claims.  We\n\nneed  not  address  some  of  these  because  they  were  not\n\n                             -5-\n\npresented  first to the district  court.  See,  e.g., Kale v.\n                                                          \n\nCombined Ins. Co., 861 F.2d 746, 755 (1st Cir. 1988).  In any\n                 \n\nevent, none appears to have any merit.  \n\n     The   judgment  of   the   district   court   dismissing\n\nappellant's  action is  affirmed.   The  order  of the  court\n                                \n\ndenying appellant's  request for a preliminary  injunction is\n\naffirmed.      The   denial   of   appellant's   motion   for\n        \n\nreconsideration  is affirmed.   The  refusal by  the district\n                            \n\ncourt  judge  to recuse  himself  is  affirmed.   Appellant's\n                                              \n\nrequest  for oral  argument is  denied.
