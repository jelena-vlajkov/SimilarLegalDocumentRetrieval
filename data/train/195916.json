Keener, Office  of Immigration Litigation,  Civil Division,\r                         \nDepartment of Justice, on brief for respondent. \n\n                                         \n\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per  Curiam.  The instant pro se petition for review, in\r                            \n\nwhich petitioner seeks  to challenge a decision of  the Board\n\nof Immigration  Appeals upholding his  order of  deportation,\n\nfalters on procedural grounds.  In 1992, an Immigration Judge\n\nfound that  petitioner, having  been convicted of  two crimes\n\ninvolving moral  turpitude, was  deportable under 8  U.S.C.  \n\n1251(a)(2) and was undeserving  of discretionary relief under\n\n8  U.S.C.   1182(c).  The Board of Immigration Appeals upheld\n\nthis  ruling   in  a  decision  dated   September  21,  1993.\n\nPetitioner  failed  to seek  review in  this court  within 90\n\ndays, as required  by 8  U.S.C.   1105a(a)(1).   Instead,  in\n\nMarch  1994,  he filed  a motion  to  reopen with  the Board,\n\nclaiming that the decision  had not been delivered to  him in\n\nprison because its mailing label had omitted the alias (\"Paul\n\nKnight\")  under which he was incarcerated.   The Board denied\n\nthe motion to  reopen, and petitioner filed a timely petition\n\nfor  review.  In his  appellate brief, he  argues solely that\n\nthe Board's September 1993 decision was in error. \n\n     We lack jurisdiction to review the Board's 1993 decision\n\nbecause  of  petitioner's  failure   to  seek  timely  review\n\nthereof.  See, e.g., Amaral v. INS, 977 F.2d 33, 35 (1st Cir.\r                                              \n\n1992)   (compliance   with   statutory   filing   period   is\n\njurisdictional  prerequisite);  Pimental-Romero  v. INS,  952\r                                                                   \n\nF.2d 564,  564 (1st  Cir. 1991)  (same).  As  such, the  only\n\nmatter open  for  review  is the  propriety  of  the  Board's\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ndecision  not to reopen the case.  Petitioner has waived this\n\nissue,  however,  by failing  to  advance  any argument  with\n\nregard  thereto in his appellate brief.  See, e.g., Lareau v.\r                                                                      \n\nPage, 39 F.3d 384, 390 n.3 (1st Cir. 1994); Charles  v. Rice,\r                                                                        \n\n28 F.3d 1312, 1320 (1st Cir. 1994). \n\n     We  add  that  the  two  Board  decisions  appear  fully\n\nsupportable in any event.  Its conclusion that petitioner was\n\nresponsible for any confusion  as to the name under  which he\n\nreceived mail was well within its discretion.  See, e.g., INS\r                                                                         \n\nv. Doherty, 112 S.  Ct. 719, 725 (1992) (denial  of motion to\r                      \n\nreopen subject to review under abuse of discretion standard).\n\nIts  determination  that  petitioner's  1983  conviction  was\n\n\"final\"  for  immigration  purposes appears  unexceptionable.\n\nSee, e.g.,  Morales-Alvarado v. INS,  655 F.2d 172,  175 (9th\r                                               \n\nCir. 1981)  (a conviction is  final even  though \"subject  to\n\ncollateral  attack\") (cited in White v. INS, 17 F.3d 475, 479\r                                                       \n\n(1st  Cir. 1994)).   And its  finding that  petitioner's 1977\n\nconviction   was  established   by  clear,   unequivocal  and\n\nconvincing evidence appears warranted on the facts presented.\n\n     The petition for review is denied. \r                                                  \n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
