We dismiss  Kelley's appeal\r\n\nof  the court's denial of  his motion for  a default judgment\r\n\n(also  characterized  as a  motion  for  summary judgment  by\r\n\ndefault)  for want of jurisdiction.   See Bird  v.

Construing\r\n\nKelley's  motion for  a  protective order  as  a request  for\r\n\npreliminary injunctive  relief, we  affirm the denial  of the\r\n\nmotion.     Kelley  apparently  sought  an  order  forbidding\r\n\ndefendants  from retaliating  against  him  for  having  sued\r\n\ndefendants.  We affirm  since the motion failed to  show that\r\n\nKelley  was under any present threat of such retaliation.  We\r\n\ndeny Kelley's other requests for relief as meritless.  \r\n\n          Dismissed   in   part   for   want   of   appellate\r                                                                         \r\n\njurisdiction and affirmed in part.\r                                              \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n",
