The district court entered summary judgment\r\n\nfor the attorneys.  We now affirm.  \r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n           FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\r                       FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\r                                                               \r\n\n          During the  heady  late eighties,  Carol  Lavin,  a\r\n\nJamestown, Rhode  Island real estate agent,  conceived a plan\r\n\nto  purchase and develop luxury homes on an eighty-acre tract\r\n\nof land located in Jamestown.  Lavin, a novice at real estate\r\n\ndevelopment,  enlisted her  husband Kevin  Lavin, her  sister\r\n\nJanice  Barron, and  her brother-in-law  James Barron  in the\r\n\nproject.   The new venturers were  equally unknowledgeable in\r\n\nthe nuances of real estate development. \r\n\n          Lavin   approached   the  parcel's   owners,  David\r\n\nHenderson and  Donald Huggins  (\"sellers\"),  who indicated  a\r\n\nwillingness to sell  their land for  $2.7 million.   Although\r\n\nthe  price  seemed  high,  the Lavins  and  Barrons  remained\r\n\ninterested.  However, to make the deal work, they needed more\r\n\ncapital than they had.   In order to remedy  this deficiency,\r\n\nCarol Lavin  and Janice Barron contacted  dozens of potential\r\n\ninvestors,  including  appellants  John  and  Iola  Hayes and\r\n\nRobert McGoldrick.  During the summer of 1987, the Lavins and\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nBarrons  met  with  the  Hayeses and  McGoldrick  on  several\r\n\noccasions  to   discuss  the  project.     A  rosy  financial\r\n\nprojection of the completed development forecast a $2 million\r\n\nprofit  for  the  venturers.   Eventually,  the  Hayeses  and\r\n\nMcGoldrick, with a  vision of high returns,  agreed to invest\r\n\nin  the scheme.    Like the  Lavins  and Barrons,  the  three\r\n\ninvestors had no prior experience in real estate development.\r\n\n          On September 14, 1987, Carol Lavin,  Janice Barron,\r\n\nand  John  Hayes met  with appellee  Steven McInnis,  a Rhode\r\n\nIsland attorney, about  legal representation for  the project\r\n\n(\"September  14 meeting\").   The  participants  discussed the\r\n\nproject's form  and financing.  McInnis was  advised that the\r\n\nHayeses and McGoldrick wished to  limit their investment to a\r\n\ntotal  of $200,000  (based  on a  $100,000 investment  by the\r\n\nHayeses and  a $100,000  investment by McGoldrick).   McInnis\r\n\nsuggested that rather than a general partnership  they form a\r\n\nlimited partnership,  with the Hayeses and  McGoldrick as the\r\n\nlimited partners and  the Lavins and  Barrons as the  general\r\n\npartners.   McInnis  indicated that  the prospective  limited\r\n\npartners (that is, the Hayeses and McGoldrick), might want to\r\n\nretain  their  own attorneys  to  represent  their interests.\r\n\nMcInnis  agreed to  draft  the partnership  agreement and  to\r\n\nrepresent  the limited  partnership,  later named  Cedar Hill\r\n\nDevelopments, L.P. (\"the partnership\").\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          Sometime   after  the  September  14  meeting,  the\r\n\nHayeses and McGoldrick (hereinafter, \"limited  partners\") and\r\n\nthe  Lavins  and  Barrons (hereinafter,  \"general  partners\")\r\n\ndiscussed whether  they should  retain  separate counsel,  as\r\n\nsuggested by  McInnis.  By deposition,  general partner Lavin\r\n\ntestified, \"we  all  decided  as  a group  to  let  [McInnis]\r\n\nrepresent us,\"  and she  later communicated this  decision to\r\n\nMcInnis.  In his  pretrial deposition, McInnis testified that\r\n\n\"they [the general and  limited partners] indicated that they\r\n\nwished  me to perform certain tasks on behalf of the `group,'\r\n\n. .  . but it was  phrased more in the  context of performing\r\n\ncertain, in their view,  relatively routine tasks required by\r\n\neither  the  bank or  the buyers  and  the seller.\"   McInnis\r\n\ndenies  ever  agreeing  to  represent  the  limited  partners\r\n\nindividually.  Throughout  the course of the  representation,\r\n\nall attorneys fees were billed to the partnership and paid by\r\n\npartnership funds.\r\n\n          The parties to  the transaction eventually hammered\r\n\nout the details of the transaction.  Of the $2.7 million sale\r\n\nprice,  $300,000  was  to be  in  cash,  $900,000  was to  be\r\n\nfinanced  by the sellers (secured by a second mortgage on the\r\n\nparcel), and $1.5 million  was to be financed through  a bank\r\n\nloan.  In addition, the sellers were each to  receive a 12.5%\r\n\nlimited partnership interest. \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          Meanwhile,  Carol  Lavin attempted  to  secure bank\r\n\nfinancing.  The going  proved difficult.  Three institutions,\r\n\nincluding  the Marquette  Credit Union  (\"Marquette\"), turned\r\n\ndown the group's loan application.  Later, Marquette reversed\r\n\nits position and  agreed to loan up  to $3.5 million  for the\r\n\npurchase  and  development  of  the  land.    However,  as  a\r\n\ncondition  for  the  loan,   Marquette  required  a  personal\r\n\nguaranty  from  the Lavins,  the  Barrons,  the Hayeses,  and\r\n\nMcGoldrick.  The Marquette commitment letter,  dated November\r\n\n6,  1987,  stated that  the  limited partners  would  have to\r\n\nguaranty  the loan personally  in the event  of a partnership\r\n\ndefault.   At some  point during  November 1987,  Carol Lavin\r\n\ninformed   McInnis   of  Marquette's   guaranty  requirement.\r\n\nMcInnis,  however, did  not participate  in the  negotiations\r\n\nwith  Marquette,  and at  no point  did  any of  the partners\r\n\nrequest his participation.  Marquette prepared the guaranty.\r\n\n          On  December  11,  1987,  the  general  and limited\r\n\npartners convened  at  McInnis's  office  to  sign  documents\r\n\neffecting the formation of the partnership and executing bank\r\n\ndocuments  including  the  guaranty.   There  is  conflicting\r\n\nevidence in  the record  as to  whether the  limited partners\r\n\nknew  of  the  personal  guaranty requirement  prior  to  the\r\n\nDecember 11 meeting, although all three appear to have signed\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nthe  commitment  letter.1   In  any event,  at  this meeting,\r\n\nMcGoldrick clearly evidenced his understanding of  the nature\r\n\nof his obligation, for he explicitly stated that he knew that\r\n\nhe was  making himself personally liable for  the entire loan\r\n\nin the  event of  a default.   For  their  part, the  Hayeses\r\n\nrecall nothing  about the  meeting or the  commitment letter,\r\n\nalthough  they acknowledge  their  signatures  appear on  the\r\n\nguaranty  agreement.  At no time, either prior to signing the\r\n\ncommitment letter  or prior  to signing the  guaranty itself,\r\n\ndid any of  the partners  request McInnis  to intervene  with\r\n\nMarquette to  seek removal  or modification of  the guaranty.\r\n\nClosing on the sale occurred on December 15, 1987.\r\n\n          The  development  quickly floundered.   Ultimately,\r\n\nonly three homes were ever sold.  By August 1988, the Hayeses\r\n\nhad retained separate counsel.  At that time,  they demanded,\r\n\nfutilely,  a  return of  their  capital  contribution and  \"a\r\n\nrelease  from  all  Limited  Partnership  obligations.\"    By\r\n\nJanuary  1989, the  partnership defaulted  with more  than $2\r\n\nmillion outstanding.   Marquette failed in  early 1991.   Its\r\n\nreceiver  held a foreclosure sale on April 17, 1991, at which\r\n\nit purchased the development for $850,000.\r\n\n          The   receiver  and  its  successor,  Rhode  Island\r\n\nDepositors Economic Protection Corporation (\"DEPCO\"), sued on\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  Hayeses  now state  that  they  are uncertain  about\r\nwhether their signatures appear on the commitment letter.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nthe guaranty  to recover  $2,004,446, plus interest  and late\r\n\ncharges.   The limited  partners, in turn,  instituted third-\r\n\nparty  claims against  McInnis and  his law  firm, Cameron  &amp;\r\n\nMittleman      (collectively,      \"attorneys\"),      seeking\r\n\nindemnification and damages.   The district court granted the\r\n\nsummary  judgment motions  of  both DEPCO  and the  attorneys\r\n\nagainst the limited  partners.  This appeal ensued.  However,\r\n\nbecause of  a  prior settlement  with DEPCO,  only the  third\r\n\nparty claims are now on appeal.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          The limited  partners raise two principal issues on\r\n\nappeal:  first, whether  they are entitled to indemnification\r\n\nby the attorneys for the amount owed to DEPCO, plus costs and\r\n\nattorneys  fees; and  second,  whether they  are entitled  to\r\n\ndamages against the attorneys under theories  of malpractice,\r\n\nbreach of  contract, and misrepresentation.   After  reciting\r\n\nthe standard of review, we discuss each argument in turn.\r\n\nA.

Indemnification Claim\r                                     \r\n\n          The limited  partners argue that the attorneys must\r\n\nindemnify  them because of negligence on  the part of McInnis\r\n\nand because of alleged  violation of Massachusetts securities\r\n\nlaws.  We find indemnification inapposite in this context.  \r\n\n          We  begin with general  principles.2   \"The concept\r\n\nof indemnity is based  upon the theory that one  who has been\r\n\nexposed to liability solely  as the result of a  wrongful act\r\n\nof  another  should be  able  to  recover from  that  party.\"\r\n\nMuldowney  v.

Thus,  one party  may seek\r\n\nfull reimbursement from another  when he has fully discharged\r\n\na  common, as opposed to \"joint,\" liability.  W.

Stated another way,\r\n\n\"[i]f another person has  been compelled to pay  damages that\r\n\nshould  have been paid  by the wrongdoer,  the latter becomes\r\n\nliable to the former.\"  Muldowney, 509 A.2d at 443.  \r                                             \r\n\n          The Rhode Island Supreme  Court has made clear that\r\n\nan indemnification  cause of  action lies in  two situations:\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The  parties do not  dispute that the  substantive law of\r\nRhode Island applies.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nfirst,  when  there  is  an   express  contractual  provision\r\n\ncreating a  right of indemnity;3 and,  second, when equitable\r\n\nprinciples give  rise to  a right  to indemnification.   Less\r\n\nclear  is the  status  of a  third  theory, that  of  implied\r\n\ncontractual  indemnification.   Although courts  have assumed\r\n\nthat an  implied contractual indemnification cause  of action\r\n\nexists, see, e.g., A  &amp; B. Constr.,  Inc. v.

For our purposes, we will assume that it\r\n\ndoes.  \r\n\n          Rhode  Island courts  will  allow  indemnity on  an\r\n\nequitable theory when three conditions obtain:\r\n\n          First, the party  seeking indemnity  must\r\n          be liable to a  third party.  Second, the\r\n          prospective   indemnitor  must   also  be\r\n          liable  to the  third party.   Third,  as\r\n          between  the  prospective indemnitee  and\r\n          indemnitor,  the  obligation ought  to be\r\n          discharged by the indemnitor.\r\n\nMuldowney, 509 A.2d  at 443-44.  The limited  partners' claim\r                     \r\n\nfails on the second and third prongs.  We know of no cause of\r\n\naction under which DEPCO would be able to proceed against the\r\n\nattorneys, a  point  which the  limited partners  essentially\r\n\nconcede  in  their brief.    By  implication, therefore,  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  No such agreement exists in this case.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nlimited partners' claim also fails on the third prong.  \"`The\r\n\npurpose  of  an indemnity  action  is  to  require the  party\r\n\nprimarily  liable  to  hold  harmless  the  party secondarily\r\n\nliable.'\"   Id.  at 444 (quoting  Helgerson v.  Mammoth Mart,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc.,  335 A.2d  339, 341  (R.I. 1975)).   Even  assuming the\r                \r\n\nattorneys were negligent or disregarded securities laws, that\r\n\ndoes nothing to absolve the limited partners of their primary\r\n\nliability on the guaranty.  \r\n\n          For similar reasons,  the limited partners' implied\r\n\ncontractual   indemnification   claim   also    fails.   \"[A]\r\n\ncontractual right  to indemnification  will  only be  implied\r\n\nwhen there are unique  special factors demonstrating that the\r\n\nparties  intended  that  the  would-be  indemnitor  bear  the\r\n\nultimate  responsibility . . .  or when there  is a generally\r\n\nrecognized special relationship between the parties.\"  Araujo\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

The limited partners fail to point\r\n\nto anything in the  record demonstrating the parties intended\r\n\nthat the attorneys would bear ultimate responsibility for the\r\n\nguaranty.  Further, even  assuming a separate attorney-client\r\n\nrelationship  existed  between the  limited partners  and the\r\n\nattorneys,  that is  not  the kind  of \"generally  recognized\r\n\nspecial  relationship\"   that  gives  rise   to  an   implied\r\n\nindemnitee-indemnitor relationship.   Cf. Prosser &amp;  Keeton  \r                                                     \r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n51  (special  relationships include,  inter  alia, employer's\r                                                             \r\n\nvicarious liability for the tort of a servant; an independent\r\n\ncontractor, or an innocent partner,  or a carrier held liable\r\n\nfor  the acts of another; an automobile owner held liable for\r\n\nthe conduct of  the driver).  While  we do not  foreclose the\r\n\npossibility that an intent  to indemnify could possibly exist\r\n\nin the  attorney-client context, there is  simply no evidence\r\n\nsupporting such a conclusion here.4\r\n\n          To sum  up, because there was  no express agreement\r\n\nto indemnify, and because the record  does not support either\r\n\nof the  other theories  of indemnification, we  conclude that\r\n\nthe district  court properly  granted summary judgment  as to\r\n\nthis claim.\r\n\nC.  Damages Claims\r                              \r\n\n          The  limited  partners  also  asserted  claims  and\r\n\nsought  damages  for   professional  negligence,  breach   of\r\n\ncontract,   and  misrepresentation.     The   district  court\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  The    limited   partners   argue   that   a   claim   of\r\nindemnification lies whenever a putative  indemnitor fails to\r\nperform  his   \"contractual  obligations  in   a  workmanlike\r\nmanner.\"   Without  regard  to whether  the limited  partners\r\nstate  a correct principle of  law, their argument is without\r\nforce  because,  as we  discuss  fully  below, there  was  no\r\ncontractual relationship between the limited partners and the\r\nattorneys.   Nor do we  agree with the  limited partners that\r\nthey   acceded   to   enforceable   rights   as   third-party\r\nbeneficiaries of  the contract between the  attorneys and the\r\npartnership.    We detect  no  evidence  indicating that  the\r\npartnership engaged  the attorneys' services with  the intent\r\nto  benefit the limited partners.  Cf. Davis v. New Eng. Pest\r                                                                         \r\nControl Co., 576 A.2d 1240, 1242 (R.I. 1990).  \r                       \r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\ndetermined that the limited partners' claims were time-barred\r\n\nas  they filed the present action more than three years after\r\n\ndiscovery of  the attorneys' alleged negligence.   Because we\r\n\nconclude that no attorney-client relationship existed in this\r\n\ncase, we do not reach the statute-of-limitations issue.\r\n\n          Recovery  under the  damages  claims  rests on  the\r\n\npremise  that an attorney-client relationship existed between\r\n\nthe limited  partners  and the  attorneys.5   See  Church  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nMcBurney,  513 A.2d 22, 23 (R.I. 1986).  To determine whether\r                    \r\n\nsuch a relationship existed  in this case, we start  with the\r\n\nbasic  proposition that  a  partnership is  a singular  legal\r\n\nentity, and  that when that  entity retains an  attorney, the\r\n\npartnership is the  client.   See, e.g., Ronald  E. Mallen  &amp;\r                                                   \r\n\nJeffrey  M. Smith, Legal Malpractice    20.7, at  260 (3d ed.\r                                                \r\n\n1989) (hereinafter, \"Mallen &amp; Smith\").  Thus, an attorney for\r\n\na  partnership  or for  a  general partner  does  not thereby\r\n\nundertake  representation  of  limited  partners.   Id.    An\r                                                                   \r\n\nattorney,  however,  may  expressly  or  impliedly  undertake\r\n\nsimultaneous representation  of the partnership and a partner\r\n\nor limited partners.  Id. at 261.\r                                     \r\n\n          The  Rhode Island  Supreme Court  has often  stated\r\n\nthat   an  attorney-client  relationship  is  contractual  in\r\n\nnature,  and thus  is  the product  of  an agreement  of  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  For  purposes  of  its  discussion,  the  district  court\r\nassumed that such a relationship existed in this case.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nparties and may be implied from their conduct.  Again, absent\r\n\nsuch a  contractual  relationship, the  attorneys would  have\r\n\nowed no duty  to the limited partners.  See  Church, 513 A.2d\r                                                               \r\n\nat 23.  We have said that, to imply a contract, including one\r\n\nbetween  an attorney and a client, the law requires more than\r\n\nan individual's  subjective, unspoken belief that  the person\r\n\nwith whom he is dealing has become his lawyer.  Sheinkopf  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nStone, 927 F.2d 1259,  1260 (1st Cir. 1991).  Rather, if such\r                 \r\n\na  belief is \"to  form a foundation for  the implication of a\r\n\nrelationship of trust and  confidence, it must be objectively\r\n\nreasonable under the totality of the circumstances.\"  Id.\r                                                                     \r\n\n          Although  the  existence   of  an   attorney-client\r\n\nrelationship  is  critical  to  their  success,  the  limited\r\n\npartners  offer only  minimal  argumentation  on this  point.\r\n\nAfter  close  examination,  we  conclude   that  the  limited\r\n\npartners'  claim  ultimately  rests  on  a subjective  belief\r\n\ncompletely  unsupported by  any indicia  that the  belief was\r\n\nobjectively  reasonable or that the limited partners actually\r\n\nrelied  on such  a belief.   Cf.  id. at  1266.   The limited\r                                                 \r\n\npartners   point  principally   to  events   surrounding  the\r\n\nSeptember 14  meeting as  evidence establishing  that McInnis\r\n\nagreed to represent their  interests separately.  However, at\r\n\nthat  meeting McInnis recommended  that, because of potential\r\n\nconflicts  of interest,  the limited  partners might  wish to\r\n\nretain separate counsel.   Later, after  consultation between\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nthe general and limited  partners, general partner Lavin told\r\n\nMcInnis that  the \"group\"  wanted McInnis to  represent them.\r\n\nEven construed in a light  favorable to the limited partners,\r\n\nwe think  McInnis was reasonable in  understanding \"group\" to\r\n\nmean  the limited partnership as an entity.  Beyond this, the\r\n\nlimited partners  point to  nothing that would  indicate that\r\n\nMcInnis  agreed to  represent  them as  limited partners  and\r\n\nMcInnis denies  having ever  agreed to represent  the limited\r\n\npartners.   Cf. Mallen &amp; Smith   7.2 (whether attorney-client\r                           \r\n\nrelationship  created  depends  on  intent  of  the  parties,\r\n\nincluding that of  the attorney).   After the  nature of  the\r\n\nlimited partners'  liability became  clear to them,  they did\r\n\nnot seek  McInnis's help. Instead, two of  them (the Hayeses)\r\n\nsought separate counsel.\r\n\n          In  contrast,  the  record  strongly  supports  the\r\n\nimplication  that  the   only  attorney-client   relationship\r\n\ninvolved in this transaction was that between McInnis and the\r\n\npartnership.   Again,  McInnis made  clear that he  agreed to\r\n\nrepresent the partnership while  suggesting that the  limited\r\n\npartners  seek   separate  counsel.    Although   not  itself\r\n\ndeterminative, McInnis  billed the partnership  directly, and\r\n\nthe partnership paid all  fees out of partnership funds.   At\r\n\nleast   through   August   1988,   the   scope  of   McInnis'\r\n\nrepresentation appears to have  been limited to preparing the\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\npartnership    agreement,   reviewing    partnership's   loan\r\n\ndocumentation, and reviewing the purchase and sale agreement.\r\n\n          In the final analysis, we conclude that the limited\r\n\npartners  rely  on  nothing  more  than  repeated  conclusory\r\n\nassertions  about  the  nature  of  their  relationship  with\r\n\nMcInnis, assertions  that are  completely unsupported  by any\r\n\nobjective indicia.   That  is not  enough to survive  summary\r\n\njudgment  on  the  question  of  whether  an  attorney-client\r\n\nrelationship actually  existed.   See Sheinkopf, 927  F.2d at\r                                                           \r\n\n1266.

Lavin, a novice at real estate development, enlisted her husband Kevin Lavin, her sister Janice Barron, and her brother-in-law James Barron in the project.  The new venturers were equally unknowledgeable in the nuances of real estate development.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lavin approached the parcel's owners, David Henderson and Donald Huggins (\"sellers\"), who indicated a willingness to sell their land for $2.7 million.  Although the price seemed high, the Lavins and Barrons remained interested.  However, to make the deal work, they needed more capital than they had.  In order to remedy this deficiency, Carol Lavin and Janice Barron contacted dozens of potential investors, including appellants John and Iola Hayes and Robert McGoldrick.  During the summer of 1987, the Lavins and Barrons met with the Hayeses and McGoldrick on several occasions to discuss the project.  A rosy financial projection of the completed development forecast a $2 million profit for the venturers.  Eventually, the Hayeses and McGoldrick, with a vision of high returns, agreed to invest in the scheme.  Like the Lavins and Barrons, the three investors had no prior experience in real estate development.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 14, 1987, Carol Lavin, Janice Barron, and John Hayes met with appellee Steven McInnis, a Rhode Island attorney, about legal representation for the project (\"September 14 meeting\").  The participants discussed the project's form and financing.  McInnis was advised that the Hayeses and McGoldrick wished to limit their investment to a total of $200,000 (based on a $100,000 investment by the Hayeses and a $100,000 investment by McGoldrick).  McInnis suggested that rather than a general partnership they form a limited partnership, with the Hayeses and McGoldrick as the limited partners and the Lavins and Barrons as the general partners.  McInnis indicated that the prospective limited partners (that is, the Hayeses and McGoldrick), might want to retain their own attorneys to represent their interests.  McInnis agreed to draft the partnership agreement and to represent the limited partnership, later named Cedar Hill Developments, L.P.  (\"the partnership\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime after the September 14 meeting, the Hayeses and McGoldrick (hereinafter, \"limited partners\") and the Lavins and Barrons (hereinafter, \"general partners\") discussed whether they should retain separate counsel, as suggested by McInnis.  By deposition, general partner Lavin testified, \"we all decided as a group to let [McInnis] represent us,\" and she later communicated this decision to McInnis.  In his pretrial deposition, McInnis testified that \"they [the general and limited partners] indicated that they wished me to perform certain tasks on behalf of the 'group,' ... but it was phrased more in the context of performing certain, in their view, relatively routine tasks required by either the bank or the buyers and the seller.\"   McInnis denies ever agreeing to represent the limited partners individually.  Throughout the course of the representation, all attorneys fees were billed to the partnership and paid by partnership funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties to the transaction eventually hammered out the details of the transaction.  Of the $2.7 million sale price, $300,000 was to be in cash, $900,000 was to be financed by the sellers (secured by a second mortgage on the parcel), and $1.5 million was to be financed through a bank loan.  In addition, the sellers were each to receive a 12.5% limited partnership interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Carol Lavin attempted to secure bank financing.  The going proved difficult.  Three institutions, including the Marquette Credit Union (\"Marquette\"), turned down the group's loan application.  Later, Marquette reversed its position and agreed to loan up to $3.5 million for the purchase and development of the land.  However, as a condition for the loan, Marquette required a personal guaranty from the Lavins, the Barrons, the Hayeses, and McGoldrick.  The Marquette commitment letter, dated November 6, 1987, stated that the limited partners would have to guaranty the loan personally in the event of a partnership default.  At some point during November 1987, Carol Lavin informed McInnis of Marquette's guaranty requirement.  McInnis, however, did not participate in the negotiations with Marquette, and at no point did any of the partners request his participation.  Marquette prepared the guaranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 11, 1987, the general and limited partners convened at McInnis's office to sign documents effecting the formation of the partnership and executing bank documents including the guaranty.  There is conflicting evidence in the record as to whether the limited partners knew of the personal guaranty requirement prior to the December 11 meeting, although all three appear to have signed the commitment letter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In any event, at this meeting, McGoldrick clearly evidenced his understanding of the nature of his obligation, for he explicitly stated that he knew that he was making himself personally liable for the entire loan in the event of a default.  For their part, the Hayeses recall nothing about the meeting or the commitment letter, although they acknowledge their signatures appear on the guaranty agreement.  At no time, either prior to signing the commitment letter or prior to signing the guaranty itself, did any of the partners request McInnis to intervene with Marquette to seek removal or modification of the guaranty.  Closing on the sale occurred on December 15, 1987.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The development quickly floundered.  Ultimately, only three homes were ever sold.  By August 1988, the Hayeses had retained separate counsel.  At that time, they demanded, futilely, a return of their capital contribution and \"a release from all Limited Partnership obligations.\"   By January 1989, the partnership defaulted with more than $2 million outstanding.  Marquette failed in early 1991.  Its receiver held a foreclosure sale on April 17, 1991, at which it purchased the development for $850,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The receiver and its successor, Rhode Island Depositors Economic Protection Corporation (\"DEPCO\"), sued on the guaranty to recover $2,004,446, plus interest and late charges.  The limited partners, in turn, instituted third-party claims against McInnis and his law firm, Cameron &amp; Mittleman (collectively, \"attorneys\"), seeking indemnification and damages.  The district court granted the summary judgment motions of both DEPCO and the attorneys against the limited partners.  This appeal ensued.  However, because of a prior settlement with DEPCO, only the third party claims are now on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The limited partners raise two principal issues on appeal:  first, whether they are entitled to indemnification by the attorneys for the amount owed to DEPCO, plus costs and attorneys fees;  and second, whether they are entitled to damages against the attorneys under theories of malpractice, breach of contract, and misrepresentation.  After reciting the standard of review, we discuss each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate when the record reflects \"no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  We review a grant of summary judgment de novo.  See, e.g., Colonial Courts Apartment Co. v. Proc Assocs., 57 F.3d 119, 122 (1st Cir.1995).  We review the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and indulge all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Indemnification Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The limited partners argue that the attorneys must indemnify them because of negligence on the part of McInnis and because of alleged violation of Massachusetts securities laws.  We find indemnification inapposite in this context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with general principles.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  \"The concept of indemnity is based upon the theory that one who has been exposed to liability solely as the result of a wrongful act of another should be able to recover from that party.\"  Muldowney v. Weatherking Prods., Inc., 509 A.2d 441, 443 (R.I.1986) (citation omitted).  Thus, one party may seek full reimbursement from another when he has fully discharged a common, as opposed to \"joint,\" liability.  W. Page Keeton, et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts Sec. 51 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter, \"Prosser &amp; Keeton\").  Stated another way, \"[i]f another person has been compelled to pay damages that should have been paid by the wrongdoer, the latter becomes liable to the former.\"  Muldowney, 509 A.2d at 443.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rhode Island Supreme Court has made clear that an indemnification cause of action lies in two situations:  first, when there is an express contractual provision creating a right of indemnity;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  and, second, when equitable principles give rise to a right to indemnification.  Less clear is the status of a third theory, that of implied contractual indemnification. Although courts have assumed that an implied contractual indemnification cause of action exists, see, e.g., A &amp; B. Constr., Inc. v. Atlas Roofing &amp; Skylight Co., 867 F.Supp. 100, 107 (D.R.I.1994);  Roy v. Star Chopper Co., 442 F.Supp. 1010, 1019 (D.R.I.1977), aff'd, 584 F.2d 1124 (1st Cir.1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 916, 99 S.Ct. 1234, 59 L.Ed.2d 466 (1979), the Rhode Island Supreme Court has never explicitly so held.  For our purposes, we will assume that it does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rhode Island courts will allow indemnity on an equitable theory when three conditions obtain:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>First, the party seeking indemnity must be liable to a third party.  Second, the prospective indemnitor must also be liable to the third party.  Third, as between the prospective indemnitee and indemnitor, the obligation ought to be discharged by the indemnitor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Muldowney, 509 A.2d at 443-44.   The limited partners' claim fails on the second and third prongs.  We know of no cause of action under which DEPCO would be able to proceed against the attorneys, a point which the limited partners essentially concede in their brief.  By implication, therefore, the limited partners' claim also fails on the third prong.  \" 'The purpose of an indemnity action is to require the party primarily liable to hold harmless the party secondarily liable.' \"  Id. at 444 (quoting Helgerson v. Mammoth Mart, Inc., 114 R.I. 438, 335 A.2d 339, 341 (1975)).  Even assuming the attorneys were negligent or disregarded securities laws, that does nothing to absolve the limited partners of their primary liability on the guaranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For similar reasons, the limited partners' implied contractual indemnification claim also fails.  \"[A] contractual right to indemnification will only be implied when there are unique special factors demonstrating that the parties intended that the would-be indemnitor bear the ultimate responsibility ... or when there is a generally recognized special relationship between the parties.\"  Araujo v. Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket S.S. Auth., 693 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1982) (citing Roy, 442 F.Supp. at 1019) (other citation omitted).  The limited partners fail to point to anything in the record demonstrating the parties intended that the attorneys would bear ultimate responsibility for the guaranty.  Further, even assuming a separate attorney-client relationship existed between the limited partners and the attorneys, that is not the kind of \"generally recognized special relationship\" that gives rise to an implied indemnitee-indemnitor relationship.  Cf. Prosser &amp; Keeton Sec. 51 (special relationships include, inter alia, employer's vicarious liability for the tort of a servant;  an independent contractor, or an innocent partner, or a carrier held liable for the acts of another;  an automobile owner held liable for the conduct of the driver).  While we do not foreclose the possibility that an intent to indemnify could possibly exist in the attorney-client context, there is simply no evidence supporting such a conclusion here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, because there was no express agreement to indemnify, and because the record does not support either of the other theories of indemnification, we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment as to this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Damages Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The limited partners also asserted claims and sought damages for professional negligence, breach of contract, and misrepresentation.  The district court determined that the limited partners' claims were time-barred as they filed the present action more than three years after discovery of the attorneys' alleged negligence.  Because we conclude that no attorney-client relationship existed in this case, we do not reach the statute-of-limitations issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recovery under the damages claims rests on the premise that an attorney-client relationship existed between the limited partners and the attorneys.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See Church v. McBurney, 513 A.2d 22, 23 (R.I.1986).  To determine whether such a relationship existed in this case, we start with the basic proposition that a partnership is a singular legal entity, and that when that entity retains an attorney, the partnership is the client.  See, e.g., Ronald E. Mallen &amp; Jeffrey M. Smith, Legal Malpractice Sec. 20.7, at 260 (3d ed. 1989) (hereinafter, \"Mallen &amp; Smith\").  Thus, an attorney for a partnership or for a general partner does not thereby undertake representation of limited partners.  Id.  An attorney, however, may expressly or impliedly undertake simultaneous representation of the partnership and a partner or limited partners.  Id. at 261.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rhode Island Supreme Court has often stated that an attorney-client relationship is contractual in nature, and thus is the product of an agreement of the parties and may be implied from their conduct.  Again, absent such a contractual relationship, the attorneys would have owed no duty to the limited partners.  See Church, 513 A.2d at 23.   We have said that, to imply a contract, including one between an attorney and a client, the law requires more than an individual's subjective, unspoken belief that the person with whom he is dealing has become his lawyer.  Sheinkopf v. Stone, 927 F.2d 1259, 1260 (1st Cir.1991).  Rather, if such a belief is \"to form a foundation for the implication of a relationship of trust and confidence, it must be objectively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the existence of an attorney-client relationship is critical to their success, the limited partners offer only minimal argumentation on this point.  After close examination, we conclude that the limited partners' claim ultimately rests on a subjective belief completely unsupported by any indicia that the belief was objectively reasonable or that the limited partners actually relied on such a belief.  Cf. id. at 1266.   The limited partners point principally to events surrounding the September 14 meeting as evidence establishing that McInnis agreed to represent their interests separately.  However, at that meeting McInnis recommended that, because of potential conflicts of interest, the limited partners might wish to retain separate counsel.  Later, after consultation between the general and limited partners, general partner Lavin told McInnis that the \"group\" wanted McInnis to represent them.  Even construed in a light favorable to the limited partners, we think McInnis was reasonable in understanding \"group\" to mean the limited partnership as an entity.  Beyond this, the limited partners point to nothing that would indicate that McInnis agreed to represent them as limited partners and McInnis denies having ever agreed to represent the limited partners.  Cf. Mallen &amp; Smith Sec. 7.2 (whether attorney-client relationship created depends on intent of the parties, including that of the attorney).  After the nature of the limited partners' liability became clear to them, they did not seek McInnis's help.  Instead, two of them (the Hayeses) sought separate counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, the record strongly supports the implication that the only attorney-client relationship involved in this transaction was that between McInnis and the partnership.  Again, McInnis made clear that he agreed to represent the partnership while suggesting that the limited partners seek separate counsel.  Although not itself determinative, McInnis billed the partnership directly, and the partnership paid all fees out of partnership funds.  At least through August 1988, the scope of McInnis' representation appears to have been limited to preparing the partnership agreement, reviewing partnership's loan documentation, and reviewing the purchase and sale agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the final analysis, we conclude that the limited partners rely on nothing more than repeated conclusory assertions about the nature of their relationship with McInnis, assertions that are completely unsupported by any objective indicia.  That is not enough to survive summary judgment on the question of whether an attorney-client relationship actually existed.  See Sheinkopf, 927 F.2d at 1266.   Consequently, the district court properly granted summary judgment on appellants' claims for damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Hayeses now state that they are uncertain about whether their signatures appear on the commitment letter</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The parties do not dispute that the substantive law of Rhode Island applies</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> No such agreement exists in this case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The limited partners argue that a claim of indemnification lies whenever a putative indemnitor fails to perform his \"contractual obligations in a workmanlike manner.\"   Without regard to whether the limited partners state a correct principle of law, their argument is without force because, as we discuss fully below, there was no contractual relationship between the limited partners and the attorneys.  Nor do we agree with the limited partners that they acceded to enforceable rights as third-party beneficiaries of the contract between the attorneys and the partnership.  We detect no evidence indicating that the partnership engaged the attorneys' services with the intent to benefit the limited partners.  Cf. Davis v. New Eng.

Lavin, a novice at real estate development, enlisted her husband Kevin Lavin, her sister Janice Barron, and her brother-in-law James Barron in the project.  The new venturers were equally unknowledgeable in the nuances of real estate development.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lavin approached the parcel's owners, David Henderson and Donald Huggins (\"sellers\"), who indicated a willingness to sell their land for $2.7 million.  Although the price seemed high, the Lavins and Barrons remained interested.  However, to make the deal work, they needed more capital than they had.  In order to remedy this deficiency, Carol Lavin and Janice Barron contacted dozens of potential investors, including appellants John and Iola Hayes and Robert McGoldrick.  During the summer of 1987, the Lavins and Barrons met with the Hayeses and McGoldrick on several occasions to discuss the project.  A rosy financial projection of the completed development forecast a $2 million profit for the venturers.  Eventually, the Hayeses and McGoldrick, with a vision of high returns, agreed to invest in the scheme.  Like the Lavins and Barrons, the three investors had no prior experience in real estate development.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 14, 1987, Carol Lavin, Janice Barron, and John Hayes met with appellee Steven McInnis, a Rhode Island attorney, about legal representation for the project (\"September 14 meeting\").  The participants discussed the project's form and financing.  McInnis was advised that the Hayeses and McGoldrick wished to limit their investment to a total of $200,000 (based on a $100,000 investment by the Hayeses and a $100,000 investment by McGoldrick).  McInnis suggested that rather than a general partnership they form a limited partnership, with the Hayeses and McGoldrick as the limited partners and the Lavins and Barrons as the general partners.  McInnis indicated that the prospective limited partners (that is, the Hayeses and McGoldrick), might want to retain their own attorneys to represent their interests.  McInnis agreed to draft the partnership agreement and to represent the limited partnership, later named Cedar Hill Developments, L.P.  (\"the partnership\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime after the September 14 meeting, the Hayeses and McGoldrick (hereinafter, \"limited partners\") and the Lavins and Barrons (hereinafter, \"general partners\") discussed whether they should retain separate counsel, as suggested by McInnis.  By deposition, general partner Lavin testified, \"we all decided as a group to let [McInnis] represent us,\" and she later communicated this decision to McInnis.  In his pretrial deposition, McInnis testified that \"they [the general and limited partners] indicated that they wished me to perform certain tasks on behalf of the 'group,' ... but it was phrased more in the context of performing certain, in their view, relatively routine tasks required by either the bank or the buyers and the seller.\"   McInnis denies ever agreeing to represent the limited partners individually.  Throughout the course of the representation, all attorneys fees were billed to the partnership and paid by partnership funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties to the transaction eventually hammered out the details of the transaction.  Of the $2.7 million sale price, $300,000 was to be in cash, $900,000 was to be financed by the sellers (secured by a second mortgage on the parcel), and $1.5 million was to be financed through a bank loan.  In addition, the sellers were each to receive a 12.5% limited partnership interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Carol Lavin attempted to secure bank financing.  The going proved difficult.  Three institutions, including the Marquette Credit Union (\"Marquette\"), turned down the group's loan application.  Later, Marquette reversed its position and agreed to loan up to $3.5 million for the purchase and development of the land.  However, as a condition for the loan, Marquette required a personal guaranty from the Lavins, the Barrons, the Hayeses, and McGoldrick.  The Marquette commitment letter, dated November 6, 1987, stated that the limited partners would have to guaranty the loan personally in the event of a partnership default.  At some point during November 1987, Carol Lavin informed McInnis of Marquette's guaranty requirement.  McInnis, however, did not participate in the negotiations with Marquette, and at no point did any of the partners request his participation.  Marquette prepared the guaranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 11, 1987, the general and limited partners convened at McInnis's office to sign documents effecting the formation of the partnership and executing bank documents including the guaranty.  There is conflicting evidence in the record as to whether the limited partners knew of the personal guaranty requirement prior to the December 11 meeting, although all three appear to have signed the commitment letter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In any event, at this meeting, McGoldrick clearly evidenced his understanding of the nature of his obligation, for he explicitly stated that he knew that he was making himself personally liable for the entire loan in the event of a default.  For their part, the Hayeses recall nothing about the meeting or the commitment letter, although they acknowledge their signatures appear on the guaranty agreement.  At no time, either prior to signing the commitment letter or prior to signing the guaranty itself, did any of the partners request McInnis to intervene with Marquette to seek removal or modification of the guaranty.  Closing on the sale occurred on December 15, 1987.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The development quickly floundered.  Ultimately, only three homes were ever sold.  By August 1988, the Hayeses had retained separate counsel.  At that time, they demanded, futilely, a return of their capital contribution and \"a release from all Limited Partnership obligations.\"   By January 1989, the partnership defaulted with more than $2 million outstanding.  Marquette failed in early 1991.  Its receiver held a foreclosure sale on April 17, 1991, at which it purchased the development for $850,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The receiver and its successor, Rhode Island Depositors Economic Protection Corporation (\"DEPCO\"), sued on the guaranty to recover $2,004,446, plus interest and late charges.  The limited partners, in turn, instituted third-party claims against McInnis and his law firm, Cameron &amp; Mittleman (collectively, \"attorneys\"), seeking indemnification and damages.  The district court granted the summary judgment motions of both DEPCO and the attorneys against the limited partners.  This appeal ensued.  However, because of a prior settlement with DEPCO, only the third party claims are now on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The limited partners raise two principal issues on appeal:  first, whether they are entitled to indemnification by the attorneys for the amount owed to DEPCO, plus costs and attorneys fees;  and second, whether they are entitled to damages against the attorneys under theories of malpractice, breach of contract, and misrepresentation.  After reciting the standard of review, we discuss each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

The limited partners' claim fails on the second and third prongs.  We know of no cause of action under which DEPCO would be able to proceed against the attorneys, a point which the limited partners essentially concede in their brief.

The limited partners fail to point to anything in the record demonstrating the parties intended that the attorneys would bear ultimate responsibility for the guaranty.  Further, even assuming a separate attorney-client relationship existed between the limited partners and the attorneys, that is not the kind of \"generally recognized special relationship\" that gives rise to an implied indemnitee-indemnitor relationship.  Cf. Prosser &amp; Keeton Sec. 51 (special relationships include, inter alia, employer's vicarious liability for the tort of a servant;  an independent contractor, or an innocent partner, or a carrier held liable for the acts of another;  an automobile owner held liable for the conduct of the driver).  While we do not foreclose the possibility that an intent to indemnify could possibly exist in the attorney-client context, there is simply no evidence supporting such a conclusion here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, because there was no express agreement to indemnify, and because the record does not support either of the other theories of indemnification, we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment as to this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.

McBurney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2088327\"><a href=\"/opinion/2088327/church-v-mcburney/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 23 (R.I.1986).  To determine whether such a relationship existed in this case, we start with the basic proposition that a partnership is a singular legal entity, and that when that entity retains an attorney, the partnership is the client.  See, e.g., Ronald E. Mallen &amp; Jeffrey M. Smith, Legal Malpractice Sec. 20.7, at 260 (3d ed. 1989) (hereinafter, \"Mallen &amp; Smith\").  Thus, an attorney for a partnership or for a general partner does not thereby undertake representation of limited partners.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2088327\"><a href=\"/opinion/2088327/church-v-mcburney/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  An attorney, </a></span>however, may expressly or impliedly undertake simultaneous representation of the partnership and a partner or limited partners.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2088327\"><a href=\"/opinion/2088327/church-v-mcburney/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 261.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rhode Island Supreme Court has often stated that an attorney-client relationship is contractual in nature, and thus is the product of an agreement of the parties and may be implied from their conduct.  Again, absent such a contractual relationship, the attorneys would have owed no duty to the limited partners.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2088327\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Church,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2088327/church-v-mcburney/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>.   We have said that, to imply a contract, including one between an attorney and a client, the law requires more than an individual's subjective, unspoken belief that the person with whom he is dealing has become his lawyer.  Sheinkopf v. Stone, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557334\"><a href=\"/opinion/557334/warren-b-sheinkopf-v-john-kp-stone-iii-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1259</span></a></span>, 1260 (1st Cir.1991).  Rather, if such a belief is \"to form a foundation for the implication of a relationship of trust and confidence, it must be objectively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the existence of an attorney-client relationship is critical to their success, the limited partners offer only minimal argumentation on this point.  After close examination, we conclude that the limited partners' claim ultimately rests on a subjective belief completely unsupported by any indicia that the belief was objectively reasonable or that the limited partners actually relied on such a belief.  Cf. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557334\"><a href=\"/opinion/557334/warren-b-sheinkopf-v-john-kp-stone-iii-etc/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1266. </a></span>  The limited partners point principally to events surrounding the September 14 meeting as evidence establishing that McInnis agreed to represent their interests separately.  However, at that meeting McInnis recommended that, because of potential conflicts of interest, the limited partners might wish to retain separate counsel.  Later, after consultation between the general and limited partners, general partner Lavin told McInnis that the \"group\" wanted McInnis to represent them.  Even construed in a light favorable to the limited partners, we think McInnis was reasonable in understanding \"group\" to mean the limited partnership as an entity.  Beyond this, the limited partners point to nothing that would indicate that McInnis agreed to represent them as limited partners and McInnis denies having ever agreed to represent the limited partners.  Cf. Mallen &amp; Smith Sec. 7.2 (whether attorney-client relationship created depends on intent of the parties, including that of the attorney).  After the nature of the limited partners' liability became clear to them, they did not seek McInnis's help.  Instead, two of them (the Hayeses) sought separate counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, the record strongly supports the implication that the only attorney-client relationship involved in this transaction was that between McInnis and the partnership.  Again, McInnis made clear that he agreed to represent the partnership while suggesting that the limited partners seek separate counsel.  Although not itself determinative, McInnis billed the partnership directly, and the partnership paid all fees out of partnership funds.  At least through August 1988, the scope of McInnis' representation appears to have been limited to preparing the partnership agreement, reviewing partnership's loan documentation, and reviewing the purchase and sale agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the final analysis, we conclude that the limited partners rely on nothing more than repeated conclusory assertions about the nature of their relationship with McInnis, assertions that are completely unsupported by any objective indicia.  That is not enough to survive summary judgment on the question of whether an attorney-client relationship actually existed.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557334\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Sheinkopf,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/557334/warren-b-sheinkopf-v-john-kp-stone-iii-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1266</span></a></span>.

Nor do we agree with the limited partners that they acceded to enforceable rights as third-party beneficiaries of the contract between the attorneys and the partnership.  We detect no evidence indicating that the partnership engaged the attorneys' services with the intent to benefit the limited partners.  Cf. Davis v. New Eng.
