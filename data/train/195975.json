On  March 9,  1994, appellant,\r                    SELYA,  Circuit Judge.\r                                         \n\nPedro Guillermo  Felix-Santos, pled  guilty to  four counts  of a\n\nnine-count indictment  charging him and other  individuals with a\n\nhost of drug-related offenses.1   The district court subsequently\n\nsentenced  appellant to a 70-month prison term, to be followed by\n\n48 months  of supervised release.   At the  same time,  the court\n\ndismissed the other counts that the grand jury had lodged against\n\nFelix-Santos, including count 4    a count that charged  him with\n\nusing a firearm  during and in  relation to the  commission of  a\n\ndrug trafficking crime.  See 18 U.S.C.   924(c)(1).\r                                      \n\n          Felix-Santos  appeals  his  conviction   and  sentence.\n\nBecause his  appeal presents no  substantial, properly cognizable\n\nquestion, we summarily affirm.  See 1st Cir. R. 27.1.\r                                             \n\n          Felix-Santos  advances  two  principal  assignments  of\n\nerror.  First,  he contends  that his guilty  plea resulted  from\n\ntrial  counsel's  ineptitude, and  that  he  should therefore  be\n\npermitted  to withdraw it. This contention is simply not ripe for\n\nconsideration on direct appeal.  As we recently explained:\n\n          We have  held with a  regularity bordering on\n          the monotonous that  fact-specific claims  of\n          ineffective  assistance   cannot  make  their\n          debut   on   direct   review    of   criminal\n          convictions, but, rather, must  originally be\n          presented  to, and acted  upon by,  the trial\n          court.   See, e.g., United States  v. McGill,\r                                                                \n          952  F.2d  16,  19  (1st  Cir.  1991); United\r                                                                 \n                    \r                              \n\n     1The four  counts to which Felix-Santos  pled guilty charged\nhim with conspiring to possess and distribute kilogram quantities\nof cocaine  in violation of 21  U.S.C.    841(a)(1)(b)(1)(B)(ii),\n846  (count  1),  and  using  telephones  on  three occasions  to\nfacilitate the conspiracy  in violation of 21 U.S.C.    843(b)(c)\nand 18 U.S.C.   2 (counts 5, 6, and 8).\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n          States  v.

Hoyos-Medina,  878 F.2d 21,\r                                                  \n          22 (1st Cir. 1989); United States  v. Carter,\r                                                                \n          815  F.2d 827,  829 (1st  Cir. 1987);  United\r                                                                 \n          States v.

Since   claims  of   ineffective\n          assistance  involve a  binary analysis    the\n          defendant  must  show, first,  that counsel's\n          performance  was  constitutionally  deficient\n          and, second, that  the deficient  performance\n          prejudiced  the  defense,  see Strickland  v.\r                                                             \n          Washington, 466  U.S. 668, 687 (1984)    such\r                              \n          claims  typically  require the  resolution of\n          factual issues that  cannot efficaciously  be\n          addressed  in   the  first  instance   by  an\n          appellate  tribunal.  See  Costa, 890 F.2d at\r                                                    \n          483;  Hoyos-Medina,  878  F.2d  at  22.    In\r                                      \n          addition, the  trial judge, by  reason of his\n          familiarity with the case,  is usually in the\n          best position to  assess both the  quality of\n          the  legal  representation  afforded  to  the\n          defendant  in  the  district  court  and  the\n          impact    of    any    shortfall   in    that\n          representation.   Under  ideal circumstances,\n          the court of appeals should have the  benefit\n          of this evaluation;  elsewise, the court,  in\n          effect, may be playing blindman's buff.\n\nUnited  States v.  Mala,  7  F.3d  1058,  1063  (1st  Cir.  1993)\r                                 \n\n(footnote omitted).\n\n          Appellant's   case  is   emblematic   of  the   reasons\n\nundergirding the rule.  The accusation that counsel blundered was\n\nnot voiced  below; the district court  has not spoken to  it; and\n\nunanswered factual  questions abound.  Consequently,  it would be\n\nimprudent to entertain the ineffective assistance claim on direct\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nreview, and we decline to do so.2\n\n          Felix-Santos'   remaining  contention   implicates  the\n\nsentencing phase.  The  lower court boosted his offense  level by\n\ntwo levels premised on  his alleged use of a  firearm in relation\n\nto the drug trafficking conspiracy.3   In turn, this  enhancement\n\nincreased the guideline sentencing  range and resulted in a  more\n\nonerous sentence. Appellant contends that the court erred in this\n\nrespect.  On the  record as it presently stands,  this contention\n\nis untenable.\n\n          We begin  our explanation  by noting that  the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of count 4 has little bearing on the sentencing\n\nenhancement.   It is firmly  settled that,  under the  sentencing\n\nguidelines, conduct  embodied  in  counts  that  were  originally\n\ncharged,  but later dropped,  may nonetheless be  used to upgrade\n\nthe  sentencing range  applicable  to the  counts of  conviction.\n\nSee, e.g.,  United States v.  Garcia, 954  F.2d 12, 15  (1st Cir.\r                                              \n\n1992);  cf. United States v. Mocciola,  891 F.2d 13, 17 (1st Cir.\r                                               \n\n1989)  (enunciating  same  principle  in  respect to  \"acquitted\"\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     2To  be  sure, we  have  occasionally  undertaken review  of\nineffective assistance claims on  direct appeal, even without the\nadvantage of the district court's views.  See, e.g., Natanel, 938\r                                                                      \nF.2d at  309.  It is  important to note, however,  that we seldom\ntravel this route unless  \"the critical facts are not  in dispute\nand  the  record  is  sufficiently developed  to  allow  reasoned\nconsideration of the claim.\"  Id.\r                                           \n\n     3U.S.S.G.  2D1.1(b)(1) provides  for a two-level enhancement\nof  a defendant's offense level  if a firearm  or other dangerous\nweapon was present  during the commission  of a drug  trafficking\noffense  unless the  sentencing  court finds  it  to be  \"clearly\nimprobable  that  the weapon  was  connected  with the  offense.\"\nU.S.S.G.  2D1.1, comment. (n.3).\n\n                                4\r\r\n\ncounts).  Thus,  the fact  that the government  moved to  dismiss\n\ncount  4,  even  when  coupled  with  the  fact  that  the  court\n\nacquiesced,  did not  bar  consideration of  the conduct  charged\n\ntherein   the use of  a firearm during and in relation  to a drug\n\ntrafficking conspiracy   as a basis for elevating the defendant's\n\noffense level.\n\n          Appellant's  assignment of error has another dimension.\n\nHe  asserts  that the  court lacked  a  proper factual  basis for\n\napplying the enhancement.   This asseveration, too, is profoundly\n\nflawed.    In the  first  place, appellant  acknowledges  that he\n\nstipulated to the applicability of the enhancement as part of his\n\nplea  bargaining.4   Appellant  did not  move  to set  aside  the\n\nstipulation, and,  therefore, the  sentencing court had  both the\n\nauthority  and the right to  give the stipulation  full force and\n\neffect.   See, e.g., United  States v. Adail,  30 F.3d 1046, 1047\r                                                      \n\n(8th Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S.

Pabst\r                                                                           \n\nBrewing Co., 870 F.2d  1198, 1206 (7th Cir. 1989);  United States\r                                                                           \n\nv.

The  judge summarized the stipulation on\nthe record  as providing  \"that there  is going  to be a  weapons\nenhancement for  sentencing purposes.\"  Appellant  told the judge\nthat  he  understood  the  stipulation  and was  aware  that  his\nsentence  would  \"be higher  because of  the  fact that  [he was]\ncarrying  a  revolver during  the  commission  of a  drug-related\noffense.\"\n\n                                5\r\r\n\ninformation, apart from the stipulation, to enable it to make the\n\nrequisite finding.

Gonzalez-\r                                                                           \n\nVazquez,  34 F.3d  19, 25  (1st Cir.  1994)  (explaining \"[f]acts\r                 \n\ncontained  in  a  presentence  report  ordinarily  are considered\n\nreliable evidence  for sentencing  purposes\");  United States  v.\r                                                                       \n\nMorillo,  8 F.3d  864, 872 (1st  Cir. 1993) (same)    furnished a\r                 \n\nbasis for  the enhancement.   Moreover, Felix-Santos  admitted to\n\nthe  court at the change-of-plea  hearing that there  was a valid\n\nfactual predicate  for the stipulation.  This  admission is fully\n\nequivalent to an admission that  he, in fact, bore responsibility\n\nfor the revolver.\n\n          We need go  no further.5   For the  reasons stated,  we\n\naffirm  appellant's conviction  and sentence,  without prejudice,\n\nhowever, to appellant's right to raise his ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel claims, and any other properly cognizable claims, on a\n\npetition for post-conviction relief filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  \n\n2255.   See, e.g., Mala, 7 F.3d at  1063.

At the same time, the court dismissed the other counts that the grand jury had lodged against Felix-Santos, including count 4 a count that charged him with using a firearm during and in relation to the commission of a drug trafficking crime.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Felix-Santos appeals his conviction and sentence.  Because his appeal presents no substantial, properly cognizable question, we summarily affirm.  See 1st Cir.  R. 27.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Felix-Santos advances two principal assignments of error.  First, he contends that his guilty plea resulted from trial counsel's ineptitude, and that he should therefore be permitted to withdraw it.  This contention is simply not ripe for consideration on direct appeal.  As we recently explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.  See, e.g., United States v. McGill, 952 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 1991);  United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 1991);  cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 986 (1992);  United States v. Hunnewell, 891 F.2d 955, 956 (1st Cir. 1989);  United States v. Costa, 890 F.2d 480, 482-83 (1st Cir. 1989);  United States v. Hoyos-Medina, 878 F.2d 21, 22 (1st Cir. 1989);  United States v. Carter, 815 F.2d 827, 829 (1st Cir. 1987);  United States v. Kobrosky, 711 F.2d 449, 457 (1st Cir. 1983).  The rule has a prudential aspect.  Since claims of ineffective assistance involve a binary analysis the defendant must show, first, that counsel's performance was constitutionally deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense, see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984) such claims typically require the resolution of factual issues that cannot efficaciously be addressed in the first instance by an appellate tribunal.  See Costa, 890 F.2d at 483;  Hoyos-Medina, 878 F.2d at 22.  In addition, the trial judge, by reason of his familiarity with the case, is usually in the best position to assess both the quality of the legal representation afforded to the defendant in the district court and the impact of any shortfall in that representation.  Under ideal circumstances, the court of appeals should have the benefit of this evaluation;  elsewise, the court, in effect, may be playing blindman's buff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993) (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's case is emblematic of the reasons undergirding the rule.  The accusation that counsel blundered was not voiced below;  the district court has not spoken to it;  and unanswered factual questions abound.  Consequently, it would be imprudent to entertain the ineffective assistance claim on direct review, and we decline to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Felix-Santos' remaining contention implicates the sentencing phase.  The lower court boosted his offense level by two levels premised on his alleged use of a firearm in relation to the drug trafficking conspiracy.<sup>3</sup>  In turn, this enhancement increased the guideline sentencing range and resulted in a more onerous sentence.  Appellant contends that the court erred in this respect.  On the record as it presently stands, this contention is untenable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our explanation by noting that the district court's dismissal of count 4 has little bearing on the sentencing enhancement.  It is firmly settled that, under the sentencing guidelines, conduct embodied in counts that were originally charged, but later dropped, may nonetheless be used to upgrade the sentencing range applicable to the counts of conviction.  See, e.g., United States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1992);  cf.  United States v. Mocciola, 891 F.2d 13, 17 (1st Cir. 1989) (enunciating same principle in respect to \"acquitted\" counts).  Thus, the fact that the government moved to dismiss count 4, even when coupled with the fact that the court acquiesced, did not bar consideration of the conduct charged therein the use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking conspiracy as a basis for elevating the defendant's offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's assignment of error has another dimension.  He asserts that the court lacked a proper factual basis for applying the enhancement.  This asseveration, too, is profoundly flawed.  In the first place, appellant acknowledges that he stipulated to the applicability of the enhancement as part of his plea bargaining.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Appellant did not move to set aside the stipulation, and, therefore, the sentencing court had both the authority and the right to give the stipulation full force and effect.  See, e.g., United States v. Adail, 30 F.3d 1046, 1047 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 653 (1994);  United States v. McGill, 952 F.2d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1991);  Graefenhain v. Pabst Brewing Co., 870 F.2d 1198, 1206 (7th Cir. 1989);  United States v. Kulp, 365 F. Supp. 747, 763 (E.D. Pa. 1973), aff'd, 497 F.2d 921 (3d Cir. 1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, the court had before it sufficient information, apart from the stipulation, to enable it to make the requisite finding.  The presentence investigation report which itself has evidentiary effect, see United States v. Gonzalez- Vazquez, 34 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir. 1994) (explaining \"[f]acts contained in a presentence report ordinarily are considered reliable evidence for sentencing purposes\");  United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 872 (1st Cir. 1993) (same) furnished a basis for the enhancement.  Moreover, Felix-Santos admitted to the court at the change-of-plea hearing that there was a valid factual predicate for the stipulation.  This admission is fully equivalent to an admission that he, in fact, bore responsibility for the revolver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  For the reasons stated, we affirm appellant's conviction and sentence, without prejudice, however, to appellant's right to raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claims, and any other properly cognizable claims, on a petition for post-conviction relief filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255.  See, e.g., Mala, 7 F.3d at 1063.  We intimate no opinion as to the merit or lack of merit of any such claim(s).  Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The four counts to which Felix-Santos pled guilty charged him with conspiring to possess and distribute kilogram quantities of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1)(b)(1)(B)(ii), 846 (count 1), and using telephones on three occasions to facilitate the conspiracy in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 843(b)(c) and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2 (counts 5, 6, and 8)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> To be sure, we have occasionally undertaken review of ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal, even without the advantage of the district court's views.  See, e.g., Natanel, 938 F.2d at 309.  It is important to note, however, that we seldom travel this route unless \"the critical facts are not in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of the claim.\"  Id</p>\n        <p>3 U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1) provides for a two-level enhancement of a defendant's offense level if a firearm or other dangerous weapon was present during the commission of a drug trafficking offense unless the sentencing court finds it to be \"clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\"  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1, comment.  (n.3).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> While this stipulation does not appear in the written plea agreement, the parties discussed it with Judge Fuste at the change- of-plea hearing.  The judge summarized the stipulation on the record as providing \"that there is going to be a weapons enhancement for sentencing purposes.\"  Appellant told the judge that he understood the stipulation and was aware that his sentence would \"be higher because of the fact that [he was] carrying a revolver during the commission of a drug-related offense.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We have considered appellant's bold-faced claims that the weapons enhancement violated his rights under both the Due Process Clause and Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 32.  We find those claims to be meritless, and we reject them out of hand</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
