Pro  se petitioner Francisco  Garcia Aromi\r                                      \r\n\n(Garcia) was convicted  after pleading guilty to a  two count\r\n\nindictment that  charged him  with robbing the  San Sebastian\r\n\nbranch  of the  Banco Popular  de Puerto  Rico and  using and\r\n\ncarrying  firearms in  connection with  said robbery,  all in\r\n\nviolation  of  18  U.S.C.      2,  2113(a),  (d),   (e),  and\r\n\n924(c)(1).  He now appeals a district court order that denied\r\n\nhis motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C.   2255. \r\n\nGarcia's motion and supplemental filings alleged four claims:\r\n\n(1)  that  he  is  entitled  to  a  downward  adjustment  for\r\n\nacceptance  of  responsibility  under  a  1992  amendment  to\r\n\nU.S.S.G.  3E1.1(a),  (2) that  he is  entitled to  a downward\r\n\nadjustment  for  being  a minor  participant  under  U.S.S.G.\r\n\n 3B1.2(b),  (3)   that  his   sentence  violates   the  Fifth\r\n\nAmendment's  Equal  Protection Clause,  and (4)  that defense\r\n\ncounsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing  to appeal\r\n\nGarcia's  sentence, failing  to  seek the  minor  participant\r\n\nadjustment,   and  failing  to  explain  various  matters  to\r\n\nGarcia.1\r\n\n     We have thoroughly reviewed  the record and the parties'\r\n\nbriefs  on  appeal.   We  conclude  that the  district  court\r\n\nproperly  denied  Garcia's   3E1.1(a)  and  Equal  Protection\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Garcia alleged that defense counsel failed to explain the\r\nnature of the  offense, the  fact that Garcia  could be  held\r\nresponsible for  his codefendants'  conduct, the uses  of the\r\npresentence report, and the consequences of his guilty plea.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nclaims  for  the  reasons  stated  in  the  district  court's\r\n\nopinion.   And while  we agree that  Garcia's  3B1.2(b) claim\r\n\nwas meritless, we  note that  it also was  not cognizable  in\r\n\nthis    2255 proceeding. See  Knight v. Miller,  37 F.3d 769,\r                                                          \r\n\n771-74 (1st Cir. 1994).   We also agree that  Garcia's claims\r\n\nthat  defense  counsel  rendered  ineffective  assistance  by\r\n\nfailing  to seek  a  3B1.2(b)  adjustment and  by  failing to\r\n\nexplain  the  matters  noted  in  note  1, supra,  also  were\r                                                            \r\n\nproperly  denied  for  the  reasons stated  in  the  district\r\n\ncourt's opinion.2  Finally, Garcia has  waived his claim that\r\n\ncounsel rendered ineffective assistance  by failing to file a\r\n\nnotice  of  appeal because  he has  not  addressed it  in his\r\n\nopening brief.  Cf.  Barrett v. United States 965  F.2d 1184,\r                                                         \r\n\n1187 n. 3 (1st Cir. 1992).   Accordingly, the judgment of the\r\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\r                                      \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Moreover, as Garcia's claim that defense counsel rendered\r\nineffective  assistance by  failing  to explain  the  various\r\nmatters  identified  above  was  based only  on  his  unsworn\r\nallegations, the claim was inadequate on its face.  \"A habeas\r\napplication must rest on  a foundation of factual allegations\r\npresented  under  oath,  either  in a  verified  petition  or\r\nsupporting  affidavits.....Facts alluded  to  in  an  unsworn\r\nmemorandum will not suffice.\"  United States v.  Labonte, No.\r                                                                    \r\n95-1226,  slip op.  at 36  (1st  Cir.
