Appellant Luis Eduardo Pugliesi appeals the\r                           \n\ndenial  by the  district court  of his  motion to  compel the\n\ngovernment  to perform  its promise  to file  a motion  for a\n\ndownward departure if appellant agreed to provide information\n\nwhich did not prove to be false or misleading.  We affirm.\n\n     Prior to entering into a plea agreement on  November 16,\n\n1993,  Pugliesi was subject to a series of debriefings by the\n\ngovernment.   During the course of  the debriefings, Pugliesi\n\nchanged  his  story  and  admits  to  having  provided  false\n\ninformation.   However,  he  claims that  the information  he\n\nprovided as of the date of the agreement was truthful.\n\n     After  signing the  plea agreement,  Pugliesi  agreed to\n\nparticipate in a polygraph examination on November 23, 1993. \n\nAfter  the  completion  of   the  examination,  Pugliesi  was\n\ninformed  that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  examiner, he  had\n\nprovided   answers  which   were  indicative   of  deception.\n\nAccording  to  the  testimony  of his  case  agent,  Pugliesi\n\nthereupon  admitted that  he  had lied  during the  polygraph\n\nexamination and that he had not \"been completely truthful\" in\n\nthe   previous   debriefings.   At    Pugliesi's   subsequent\n\nsentencing,  the  government  refused   to  file  a  downward\n\ndeparture motion.\n\n     The  district court supportably  found credible the case\n\nagent's  testimony that,  on  November 23,  Pugliesi admitted\n\nhaving lied when he provided information to the government at\r\r\n\nand  after entering the plea agreement.  See United States v.\r                                                                      \n\nSt.  Cyr., 977  F.2d  698,  706  (1st  Cir.  1992)  (\"In  the\r                    \n\nsentencing phase,  credibility determinations lie  within the\n\ndomain of the district  court.\").  According to the  terms of\n\nthe  plea agreement,1  the  government was  thereby under  no\n\nobligation to  recommend a downward departure  at sentencing,\n\nand its decision not to file such a motion was neither in bad\n\nfaith nor lacking in  a rational basis.  See United States v.\r                                                                      \n\nCatalucci, No. 93-2129, slip. op.

The agreement states, in relevant part:\n\n     Should  evidence  of defendant's  mendacity, and/or\n     misleading  or  incomplete  replies  surface  after\n     defendant['s]  change  of plea,  the  United States\n     will not be bound  to file any motions or  make any\n     recommendations    favorable   to    defendant   at\n     sentencing.\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
