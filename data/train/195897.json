Acosta, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                                \n\n                                        \n\n                            Before\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r                                                     \n              Boudin and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\r                                                          \n\n                                        \n\n   Justiniano Cuevas-Burgos on brief pro se.\r                                       \n   Guillermo  Gil,  United  States  Attorney,  Jose  A.  Quiles\r                                                                           \nEspinosa, Senior  Litigation Counsel, and Jorge  E. Vega Pacheco,\r                                                                          \nChief Criminal Division, on brief for appellee. \n\n                                        \n\n                                        \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.    We  have  carefully  reviewed  the  trial\r                           \n\ntranscripts and  affirm the  denial  of petitioner's     2255\n\npetition.\n\n     1.  Sufficiency of the Evidence.  The evidence was fully\r                                                \n\nsufficient to  support the  convictions.   The  jury was  not\n\nrequired  to believe  Pagan's testimony  absolving petitioner\n\nand instead was entitled to credit the government's  evidence\n\nthat petitioner had  requested Rodriguez Vega  to supply  the\n\ncocaine and had participated in the cocaine negotiations.  \n\n     2.  Speedy Trial Act.  Petitioner has not identified any\r                                     \n\nspeedy trial  act  violation.   Petitioner's contention  that\n\nonly the four  days during which Rodriguez Vega  was actually\n\nbeing examined by a  physician were excludable is wrong.   18\n\nU.S.C.   3161(h)(1)(A) (excluding  \"delay resulting from  any\n\nproceeding,  including  any  examinations,  to  determine the\r                      \n\nmental competency . . . of the defendant\")  (emphasis added);\n\nUnited States  v. Anello,  765 F.2d  253, 255-56 (1st  Cir.),\r                                    \n\ncert. denied, 474 U.S. 996  (1985); United States v.  Zielie,\r                                                                        \n\n734  F.2d 1447, 1454 (11th Cir. 1984) (a time exclusion which\n\napplies to one defendant applies to all co-defendants), cert.\r                                                                         \n\ndenied, 469 U.S. 1189, 1216 (1985).\r                  \n\n     3.  Prejudicial   Publicity.    Petitioner's   claim  of\r                                            \n\nprejudicial publicity is meritless.  First, the publicity, as\n\ndescribed  by  petitioner,   was  much  less  extensive   and\n\nprejudicial   than  in  other   cases  in  which  prejudicial\n\npublicity  claims  have been  rejected.    See, e.g.,  United\r                                                                         \n\nStates v. Angiulo, 897 F.2d  1169, 1181-83 (1st Cir.),  cert.\r                                                                         \n\ndenied, 498 U.S. 845 (1990); United States v. Moreno Morales,\r                                                                        \n\n815 F.2d 725, 730-36  (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484  U.S. 966\r                                                          \r\r\n\n(1987).  Second, prior to trial,  Judge Acosta questioned the\n\npanel  from which the jury was chosen whether anyone had read\n\nor  heard anything about the case.  There were no affirmative\n\nresponses.   In view of the lack of response to the voir dire\n\ninquiry, there is no  evidence any juror was exposed  to pre-\n\ntrial publicity and hence no basis to find prejudice prior to\n\ntrial.  United States  v. Samalot Perez,  767 F.2d 1, 5  (1st\r                                                   \n\nCir. 1985) (\"[w]hen a  trial judge has conducted a  voir dire\n\nexamination with questions effectively designed to unveil any\n\nimpartiality, then we will  set aside his action  `only where\n\njuror  prejudice is manifest'\").  As for any publicity during\n\nthe  trial, Judge  Acosta told  the jurors  not to  listen to\n\nmedia  accounts and to decide the case solely on the evidence\n\npresented  in   court.     Jurors  are  presumed   to  follow\n\ninstructions.   United States v.  Boylan, 898  F.2d 230,  263\r                                                    \n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 849 (1990).  \r                                    \n\n     4.  Jurors' Linguistic Competency.  There is no basis to\r                                                  \n\nbelieve  that the  jurors  were not  competent to  understand\n\nEnglish.  During empanelment,  each spoke briefly in English.\n\nMost  had  already served  as jurors  on  at least  one trial\n\nconducted  in  English.   That  the  jury asked  for  further\n\nexplanation of technical legal  terms does not show inability\r                                          \n\nto understand English.\r                                 \n\n     5.   We  have considered  all of  petitioner's appellate\n\narguments, including his claims of ineffective assistance\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nof counsel, and find them meritless.\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
