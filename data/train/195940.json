Petitioner Felice  Iannetta (\"Iannetta\")\r                    Per  Curiam.\r                               \n\nappeals the Board of Immigration Appeals' (the \"Board\") denial of\n\nhis motion for  reconsideration of  his deportation  proceedings.\n\nFor the following reasons, we affirm.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\n\n          Iannetta, a native of  Italy, entered the United States\n\nin  March  1971  on  an  immigrant   visa.    Following  numerous\n\nconvictions,  including  four counts  of  assault  with a  deadly\n\nweapon, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") issued\n\nan order to show cause why Iannetta should not be deported.  At a\n\nJanuary  1992 deportation hearing,  Iannetta admitted the factual\n\nallegations and conceded his  deportability based on his numerous\n\nconvictions.  He requested discretionary relief from deportation,\n\nhowever, under   212(c) of  the Immigration and Nationality Act.1\n\nAfter  the  hearing,  the  Immigration  Judge  (\"IJ\")  issued  an\n\nopinion, finding  Iannetta deportable  on the ground  charged and\n\ndenying his request for relief under   212(c).\n\n          Iannetta  appealed  the  IJ's  decision  to the  Board,\n\nmaintaining  that the  IJ  erred  in  balancing the  equities  of\n\nIannetta's  case.   On  February  5,  1993, the  Board  summarily\n\ndismissed the appeal as \"clearly untimely\" because the  notice of\n\nappeal  was due on January 23, 1992,  but not filed at the Office\n\nof the Immigration Judge until  February 10, 1992.   Furthermore,\n\nthe required fee was not paid until January 31, 1992.\n\n                    \r                              \n\n1   Section  212(c)  of  the  Act  grants  the  Attorney  General\ndiscretion  to  admit  or  suspend  deportation  of  a  permanent\nresident who has resided in the  United States for at least seven\nyear.  8 U.S.C.   1182(c) (1988). \r\r\n\n          Iannetta filed  a motion  to reopen, claiming  that the\n\nmotion had been timely filed and any error was on the part of the\n\nINS.   The Board  denied this motion,  however, on  May 21, 1993.\n\nThe  Board stated  the requirements  for a  timely  appeal, which\n\nmandate  both timely  payment  of  a fee  to  an  INS office  and\n\nsubsequent receipt of the appeal by the Office of the Immigration\n\nJudge within 10 calendar days after the decision.  The Board then\n\nfound that the evidence supported its finding of untimely filing,\n\nand denied Iannetta's motion to reopen.\n\n          Represented by new  counsel, Iannetta again  challenged\n\nthe Board's decision by  filing a motion to reconsider.   In this\n\nmotion,  Iannetta alleged that the untimely  filing of his appeal\n\nconstituted   ineffective  assistance  of  counsel.    The  Board\n\nrejected  this motion on July 20, 1994, finding that Iannetta had\n\nnot  met  the  evidentiary requirements  for  a  motion  based on\n\nineffective assistance  of counsel as those  requirements are set\n\nforth in Matter of Lozada,  19 I &amp; N Dec. 637  (BIA 1988), aff'd,\r                                                                          \n\n857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n          Iannetta  now appeals  the  Board's rejection  of  this\n\nfinal motion to reconsider,  on three grounds.  First,  he argues\n\nthat he was denied  effective assistance of counsel, in  that his\n\nformer counsel's  failure to  timely file his  appeal effectively\n\n\"robbed\"  Iannetta of the opportunity to have his appeal heard by\n\nthe Board.   Second, Iannetta  contends that the  Board committed\n\nreversible error in denying his request for reconsideration based\n\nupon  his  ineffective assistance  of  counsel  claim.   Finally,\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nIannetta  argues that  the Board  erred in  relying on  Matter of\r                                                                           \n\nLozada, 19 I  &amp; N Dec.  637 (BIA 1988),  aff'd, 857 F.2d  10 (1st\r                                                        \n\nCir. 1988), in denying his motion for reconsideration.\n\n                             ANALYSIS\r                                       ANALYSIS\n\n          A.  Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\r                    A.  Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\r                                                         \n\n          We  have  held that  because  deportation hearings  are\n\ncivil, rather than criminal,  aliens have no constitutional right\n\nto  counsel  under  the  Sixth Amendment  in  these  proceedings.\n\nLozada,  857  F.2d  at 13  (citations  omitted).    An alien  is,\r                \n\nhowever,  entitled to a fair hearing under the due process clause\n\nof the Fifth Amendment, and ineffective assistance of counsel may\n\nunder certain circumstances give rise to a due process violation.\n\nId.   The standard for such violations  is high, however; we have\r            \n\nheld  that ineffective  assistance  of counsel  in a  deportation\n\nproceeding  is a denial of due process only if the proceeding was\n\nso  fundamentally  unfair  that  the  alien  was  prevented  from\n\nreasonably presenting  his case.  Id.  (quoting Ram rez-Durazo v.\r                                                                        \n\nINS,  794 F.2d  491,  499-500 (9th  Cir.  1986) (other  citations\r             \n\nomitted).\n\n          Iannetta argues on appeal that his right to due process\n\nwas violated by his  former counsel's failure to timely  file his\n\nappeal  of  the IJ's  deportation  decision,  as it  \"effectively\n\nrobbed\" Iannetta of the  opportunity to have his appeal  heard on\n\nthe merits.  Iannetta relies heavily on  Casta eda-Su rez v. INS,\r                                                                          \n\n993 F.2d 142 (7th Cir. 1993), in which the untimely filing of a  \n\n212(c)  relief   from  deportation  application   was  found   to\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nconstitute  ineffective  assistance   of  counsel.     Casta eda,\r                                                                          \n\nhowever,  is  inapposite and  therefore  unpersuasive  here.   In\n\nCasta eda,  the  actions of  the petitioner's  counsel completely\r                   \n\ndeprived  the  alien  of   any  opportunity  whatsoever  to  seek\n\ndiscretionary  relief under   212(c), either before the IJ or the\n\nBoard.    Casta eda,  993  F.2d  at  144-45.    This  holding  is\r                             \n\nconsistent  with  precedent in  this circuit  to the  effect that\n\nineffective assistance  of counsel  may constitute a  due process\n\nviolation if \"the alien  was prevented from reasonably presenting\n\nhis case.\"  Lozada, 857 F.2d at 13-14.\r                            \n\n          In the  instant case, on  the other hand,  Iannetta was\n\ngiven  a full  and fair  opportunity  to present  his case  for  \n\n212(c)  discretionary relief before the IJ.  He therefore had one\n\nfair  hearing, and his counsel's  actions were not  a complete or\n\neven partial deprivation of  Iannetta's reasonable opportunity to\n\nrequest   212(c) relief, as was the case in Casta eda.\r                                                               \n\n          Furthermore,  Iannetta had  no constitutional  right of\n\nreview of  the IJ's decision beyond what was provided, and one of\n\nthe  reasonable  procedural conditions  of  such  review was  the\n\ntimely filing of an appeal.  Iannetta attempts to argue here that\n\nan alien should be  allowed to avoid the adverse  consequences of\n\nnoncompliance  with this  condition by  simply failing  to timely\n\nfile  and then claiming  ineffective assistance  of counsel.   We\n\nagree  with the  INS  that  such  a  loophole  would  effectively\n\neviscerate the timeliness requirement and render the law void.\n\n          Nor are we willing to accept Iannetta's contention that\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nthe failure of his counsel to file a timely appeal is, by itself,\n\nineffective  assistance of counsel rising  to the level  of a due\n\nprocess  violation.    We  have  warned  that  absent  \"egregious\n\ncircumstances,\"     litigants  are   generally  bound   by  their\n\nattorneys'  conduct,  and it  is  not  necessarily egregious  for\n\ncounsel's  actions  to  be  the  basis  for  denying  the  client\n\ndiscretionary relief.   LeBlanc v.  INS, 715 F.2d  685, 694  (1st\r                                                 \n\nCir. 1983) (citations  omitted).  Indeed, Iannetta has  failed to\n\nargue  with any specificity how  his counsel's failure  to file a\n\ntimely  appeal was  so egregious  as to  violate due  process; he\n\nmerely sets forth  what arguments he would  make to the Board  if\n\nhis appeal were heard on its merits -- specifically, that the  IJ\n\nincorrectly balanced the equities  of his case.2  This  is simply\n\ninsufficient to  establish  a violation  of due  process, and  we\n\ntherefore  reject Iannetta's  ineffective  assistance of  counsel\n\nclaim.\n\n          B.  The Board's Denial of his Motion to Reconsider\r                    B.  The Board's Denial of his Motion to Reconsider\r                                                                      \n                    \r                              \n\n2   We note  that, had the  Board heard Iannetta's  appeal on the\nmerits, it is  extremely unlikely that  he would have  prevailed.\nHe admitted  to twenty  convictions for  a  variety of  offenses,\nincluding  assault  with a  deadly  weapon,  passing bad  checks,\nbanking law violations, and driving with a suspended license.  In\nhis hearing before  the IJ, he did  not demonstrate any  signs of\nremorse  or   acknowledgment   of  culpability.     Rather,   his\nexplanations   amounted  to   little  more   than  a   denial  of\nculpability.   He attempted  to minimize  the seriousness  of his\nassault convictions by explaining  that they were \"only\" domestic\ndisputes, and not attacks on strangers.  In light of this record,\nit seems rather clear that the IJ's balancing of the equities and\nrejection of  Iannetta's   212(c) relief  claim was well-founded,\nreasonable,  and  squarely  within  the  bounds   of  discretion.\nTherefore, even if he was denied effective assistance of counsel,\nit is extremely dubious that he would be able to show that he was\nactually prejudiced.\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          The Board's  authority to  grant  or deny  a motion  to\n\nreopen  or reconsider  deportation proceedings  is discretionary.\n\nINS v. Jong Ha Wang, 450  U.S. 139, 144 n.5 (1981).  Accordingly,\r                             \n\nwe  review the Board's decisions  regarding such motions under an\n\nabuse of  discretion standard,  reversing if the  Board's actions\n\nwere arbitrary or capricious.  INS v. Doherty,    U.S.   , 112 S.\r                                                       \n\nCt. 719,  724-25 (1992); Gebremichael v. INS, 10 F.3d 28, 34 n.17\r                                                      \n\n(1st Cir. 1993); LeBlanc, 715 F.2d at 692-93.\r                                  \n\n          Although  Iannetta  argues  vehemently that  the  Board\n\nabused its  discretion in denying his motions  to reconsider, his\n\nargument seems to rest  primarily on the fact that the  Board did\n\nnot  reach the  merits of  his appeal,  but merely  dismissed the\n\nmotion  on the ground that his appeal  was not timely filed.  Our\n\nreading of the Board's May 21, 1993 decision, however, reveals no\n\nabuse of discretion.  On the contrary, the Board clearly and with\n\nparticularity set forth  its standard for  reviewing a motion  to\n\nreconsider, carefully expounded the evidence before it, and found\n\nthat Iannetta had failed to meet his evidentiary burden.  Nothing\n\nin  the  Board's  decision  suggests  undue  haste,  caprice,  or\n\nunfairness;  the decision  is well-reasoned  and the  result well\n\nwithin  the Board's discretion.  We therefore find that the Board\n\ndid not  abuse its  discretion in  denying Iannetta's motions  to\n\nreconsider.\n\n          C.  The Board's Reliance on Matter of Lozada\r                    C.  The Board's Reliance on Matter of Lozada\r                                                                \n\n          Finally, Iannetta contends  that the Board  erroneously\n\nrelied on Matter  of Lozada  in its decision  to deny  Iannetta's\r                                     \n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nmotion for  reconsideration.  This argument  essentially rests on\n\nhis attempt  to distinguish  Lozada, stating  that it  involved a\r                                             \n\nmotion  for reopen, rather than a motion for reconsideration.  We\n\nfind this distinction meaningless in this context, and Iannetta's\n\nargument completely meritless.  As  we stated above, the  Board's\n\ndenial of  Iannetta's motion  to reconsider was  well-grounded in\n\nboth the applicable  facts and the  law.  Even  if the Board  had\n\nrelied on  the  wrong  legal  standard,  the  record  shows  that\n\nIannetta's motion was  untimely filed.  Therefore,  the Board was\n\njustified in denying his motion.  As we have further stated, even\n\nif the  Board had reconsidered  Iannetta's case, it  is extremely\n\nunlikely given  his twenty convictions  that he would  prevail on\n\nappeal.  In  short, even  assuming arguendo that  there was  some\r                                                     \n\nerror in the Board's reliance on Lozada, we simply do not see any\r                                                 \n\nprejudice or  harm resulting  from it.    Accordingly, we  reject\n\nIannetta's arguments.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\n\n          For  the  foregoing   reasons,  we  dismiss  Iannetta's\r                                                                           \n\npetition for review, and affirm the Board's denial of  Iannetta's\r                                                                           \n\nmotions and its entry of Iannetta's order of deportation.\r                                                                  \n\n                               -8-\r\r\n",

For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iannetta, a native of Italy, entered the United States in March 1971 on an immigrant visa.  Following numerous convictions, including four counts of assault with a deadly weapon, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") issued an order to show cause why Iannetta should not be deported.  At a January 1992 deportation hearing, Iannetta admitted the factual allegations and conceded his deportability based on his numerous convictions.  He requested discretionary relief from deportation, however, under Sec. 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  After the hearing, the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") issued an opinion, finding Iannetta deportable on the ground charged and denying his request for relief under Sec. 212(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iannetta appealed the IJ's decision to the Board, maintaining that the IJ erred in balancing the equities of Iannetta's case.  On February 5, 1993, the Board summarily dismissed the appeal as \"clearly untimely\" because the notice of appeal was due on January 23, 1992, but not filed at the Office of the Immigration Judge until February 10, 1992.  Furthermore, the required fee was not paid until January 31, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iannetta filed a motion to reopen, claiming that the motion had been timely filed and any error was on the part of the INS. The Board denied this motion, however, on May 21, 1993.  The Board stated the requirements for a timely appeal, which mandate both timely payment of a fee to an INS office and subsequent receipt of the appeal by the Office of the Immigration Judge within 10 calendar days after the decision.  The Board then found that the evidence supported its finding of untimely filing, and denied Iannetta's motion to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Represented by new counsel, Iannetta again challenged the Board's decision by filing a motion to reconsider.  In this motion, Iannetta alleged that the untimely filing of his appeal constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.  The Board rejected this motion on July 20, 1994, finding that Iannetta had not met the evidentiary requirements for a motion based on ineffective assistance of counsel as those requirements are set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I &amp; N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff'd, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iannetta now appeals the Board's rejection of this final motion to reconsider, on three grounds.  First, he argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, in that his former counsel's failure to timely file his appeal effectively \"robbed\" Iannetta of the opportunity to have his appeal heard by the Board.  Second, Iannetta contends that the Board committed reversible error in denying his request for reconsideration based upon his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.  Finally, Iannetta argues that the Board erred in relying on Matter of Lozada, 19 I &amp; N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff'd, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), in denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>ANALYSIS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that because deportation hearings are civil, rather than criminal, aliens have no constitutional right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment in these proceedings.  Lozada, 857 F.2d at 13 (citations omitted).  An alien is, however, entitled to a fair hearing under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, and ineffective assistance of counsel may under certain circumstances give rise to a due process violation.  Id. The standard for such violations is high, however;  we have held that ineffective assistance of counsel in a deportation proceeding is a denial of due process only if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.  Id. (quoting Ram irez-Durazo v. INS, 794 F.2d 491, 499-500 (9th Cir. 1986) (other citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iannetta argues on appeal that his right to due process was violated by his former counsel's failure to timely file his appeal of the IJ's deportation decision, as it \"effectively robbed\" Iannetta of the opportunity to have his appeal heard on the merits.  Iannetta relies heavily on Casta neda-Su arez v. INS, 993 F.2d 142 (7th Cir. 1993), in which the untimely filing of a Sec. 212(c) relief from deportation application was found to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.  Casta neda, however, is inapposite and therefore unpersuasive here.  In Casta neda, the actions of the petitioner's counsel completely deprived the alien of any opportunity whatsoever to seek discretionary relief under Sec. 212(c), either before the IJ or the Board.  Casta neda, 993 F.2d at 144-45.  This holding is consistent with precedent in this circuit to the effect that ineffective assistance of counsel may constitute a due process violation if \"the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\"  Lozada, 857 F.2d at 13-14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, on the other hand, Iannetta was given a full and fair opportunity to present his case for Sec. 212(c) discretionary relief before the IJ.  He therefore had one fair hearing, and his counsel's actions were not a complete or even partial deprivation of Iannetta's reasonable opportunity to request Sec. 212(c) relief, as was the case in Casta neda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Iannetta had no constitutional right of review of the IJ's decision beyond what was provided, and one of the reasonable procedural conditions of such review was the timely filing of an appeal.  Iannetta attempts to argue here that an alien should be allowed to avoid the adverse consequences of noncompliance with this condition by simply failing to timely file and then claiming ineffective assistance of counsel.  We agree with the INS that such a loophole would effectively eviscerate the timeliness requirement and render the law void.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor are we willing to accept Iannetta's contention that the failure of his counsel to file a timely appeal is, by itself, ineffective assistance of counsel rising to the level of a due process violation.  We have warned that absent \"egregious circumstances,\" litigants are generally bound by their attorneys' conduct, and it is not necessarily egregious for counsel's actions to be the basis for denying the client discretionary relief.  LeBlanc v. INS, 715 F.2d 685, 694 (1st Cir. 1983) (citations omitted).  Indeed, Iannetta has failed to argue with any specificity how his counsel's failure to file a timely appeal was so egregious as to violate due process;  he merely sets forth what arguments he would make to the Board if his appeal were heard on its merits-specifically, that the IJ incorrectly balanced the equities of his case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  This is simply insufficient to establish a violation of due process, and we therefore reject Iannetta's ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Board's Denial of his Motion to Reconsider</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's authority to grant or deny a motion to reopen or reconsider deportation proceedings is discretionary.  INS v. Jong Ha Wang, 450 U.S. 139, 144 n.5 (1981).  Accordingly, we review the Board's decisions regarding such motions under an abuse of discretion standard, reversing if the Board's actions were arbitrary or capricious.  INS v. Doherty, __ U.S. __, 112 S. Ct. 719, 724-25 (1992);  Gebremichael v. INS, 10 F.3d 28, 34 n.17 (1st Cir. 1993);  LeBlanc, 715 F.2d at 692-93.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Iannetta argues vehemently that the Board abused its discretion in denying his motions to reconsider, his argument seems to rest primarily on the fact that the Board did not reach the merits of his appeal, but merely dismissed the motion on the ground that his appeal was not timely filed.  Our reading of the Board's May 21, 1993 decision, however, reveals no abuse of discretion.  On the contrary, the Board clearly and with particularity set forth its standard for reviewing a motion to reconsider, carefully expounded the evidence before it, and found that Iannetta had failed to meet his evidentiary burden.  Nothing in the Board's decision suggests undue haste, caprice, or unfairness;  the decision is well-reasoned and the result well within the Board's discretion.  We therefore find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Iannetta's motions to reconsider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Board's Reliance on Matter of Lozada</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Iannetta contends that the Board erroneously relied on Matter of Lozada in its decision to deny Iannetta's motion for reconsideration.  This argument essentially rests on his attempt to distinguish Lozada, stating that it involved a motion for reopen, rather than a motion for reconsideration.  We find this distinction meaningless in this context, and Iannetta's argument completely meritless.  As we stated above, the Board's denial of Iannetta's motion to reconsider was well-grounded in both the applicable facts and the law.  Even if the Board had relied on the wrong legal standard, the record shows that Iannetta's motion was untimely filed.  Therefore, the Board was justified in denying his motion.  As we have further stated, even if the Board had reconsidered Iannetta's case, it is extremely unlikely given his twenty convictions that he would prevail on appeal.  In short, even assuming arguendo that there was some error in the Board's reliance on Lozada, we simply do not see any prejudice or harm resulting from it.  Accordingly, we reject Iannetta's arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss Iannetta's petition for review, and affirm the Board's denial of Iannetta's motions and its entry of Iannetta's order of deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 212(c) of the Act grants the Attorney General discretion to admit or suspend deportation of a permanent resident who has resided in the United States for at least seven year.  8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(c) (1988)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We note that, had the Board heard Iannetta's appeal on the merits, it is extremely unlikely that he would have prevailed.  He admitted to twenty convictions for a variety of offenses, including assault with a deadly weapon, passing bad checks, banking law violations, and driving with a suspended license.  In his hearing before the IJ, he did not demonstrate any signs of remorse or acknowledgment of culpability.  Rather, his explanations amounted to little more than a denial of culpability.  He attempted to minimize the seriousness of his assault convictions by explaining that they were \"only\" domestic disputes, and not attacks on strangers.  In light of this record, it seems rather clear that the IJ's balancing of the equities and rejection of Iannetta's Sec. 212(c) relief claim was well-founded, reasonable, and squarely within the bounds of discretion.  Therefore, even if he was denied effective assistance of counsel, it is extremely dubious that he would be able to show that he was actually prejudiced</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Our reading of the Board's May 21, 1993 decision, however, reveals no abuse of discretion.  On the contrary, the Board clearly and with particularity set forth its standard for reviewing a motion to reconsider, carefully expounded the evidence before it, and found that Iannetta had failed to meet his evidentiary burden.  Nothing in the Board's decision suggests undue haste, caprice, or unfairness;  the decision is well-reasoned and the result well within the Board's discretion.  We therefore find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Iannetta's motions to reconsider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Board's Reliance on Matter of Lozada</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Iannetta contends that the Board erroneously relied on Matter of Lozada in its decision to deny Iannetta's motion for reconsideration.  This argument essentially rests on his attempt to distinguish Lozada, stating that it involved a motion for reopen, rather than a motion for reconsideration.  We find this distinction meaningless in this context, and Iannetta's argument completely meritless.  As we stated above, the Board's denial of Iannetta's motion to reconsider was well-grounded in both the applicable facts and the law.  Even if the Board had relied on the wrong legal standard, the record shows that Iannetta's motion was untimely filed.  Therefore, the Board was justified in denying his motion.  As we have further stated, even if the Board had reconsidered Iannetta's case, it is extremely unlikely given his twenty convictions that he would prevail on appeal.  In short, even assuming arguendo that there was some error in the Board's reliance on Lozada, we simply do not see any prejudice or harm resulting from it.  Accordingly, we reject Iannetta's arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss Iannetta's petition for review, and affirm the Board's denial of Iannetta's motions and its entry of Iannetta's order of deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 212(c) of the Act grants the Attorney General discretion to admit or suspend deportation of a permanent resident who has resided in the United States for at least seven year.  8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(c) (1988)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We note that, had the Board heard Iannetta's appeal on the merits, it is extremely unlikely that he would have prevailed.  He admitted to twenty convictions for a variety of offenses, including assault with a deadly weapon, passing bad checks, banking law violations, and driving with a suspended license.  In his hearing before the IJ, he did not demonstrate any signs of remorse or acknowledgment of culpability.  Rather, his explanations amounted to little more than a denial of culpability.  He attempted to minimize the seriousness of his assault convictions by explaining that they were \"only\" domestic disputes, and not attacks on strangers.  In light of this record, it seems rather clear that the IJ's balancing of the equities and rejection of Iannetta's Sec. 212(c) relief claim was well-founded, reasonable, and squarely within the bounds of discretion.  Therefore, even if he was denied effective assistance of counsel, it is extremely dubious that he would be able to show that he was actually prejudiced</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
