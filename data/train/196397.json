Tarabolski  filed  pro  se  a\r                                                                      \r\n\ncomplaint alleging  that on  January 18, 1991,  Sharon police\r\n\nofficer Donald Williams broke into his home and forced him to\r\n\nenter a hospital for  psychiatric examination in violation of\r\n\nhis  federal  civil rights  and state  law.   In  addition to\r\n\nWilliams,  Tarabolski sued  various  other  past and  present\r\n\nmembers of  the Sharon Police Department,  various members of\r\n\nthe Sharon  Fire  Department, the  selectmen of  the Town  of\r\n\nSharon, and the Town of Sharon.  The district court dismissed\r\n\nwith prejudice  the claims  against the selectmen,  the Town,\r\n\nand the  fire department  officials  after Tarabolski  flatly\r\n\nrefused  to  comply with  the court's  order  to file  a more\r\n\ndefinite  statement.  See Fed.  R.  Civ. P.  12(e).   Summary\r                                     \r\n\njudgment  was  entered  in  favor of  the  police  department\r\n\ndefendants on the remaining federal and state law claims. See\r                                                                         \r\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  This appeal followed.\r\n\n     Having reviewed the complaint, we are persuaded that the\r\n\ndistrict  court  did not  abuse  its  discretion in  ordering\r\n\nTarabolski  to   file  a   more  definite  statement.     The\r\n\nallegations  against the  selectmen, the  Town, and  the fire\r\n\ndepartment  officials  were  vague  and  conclusory.    Given\r\n\nTarabolski's  unwillingness  to elucidate,  and  the apparent\r\n\nlack  of merit  to his  claims, we  think the  district court\r\n\nacted within its discretion  in dismissing the claims against\r\n\nthese defendants.  Cf. Kuehl v. FDIC, 8 F.3d 905, 908-09 (1st\r                                                \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nCir.  1993)  (affirming  dismissal  with prejudice  based  on\r\n\nplaintiff's failure  to comply  with Fed. R.  Civ. P.  8(a)),\r\n\ncert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1545 (1994).\r                        \r\n\n     We review de novo the grant of summary judgment in favor\r                                  \r\n\nof the  police department defendants and  affirm the judgment\r\n\nessentially for the reasons stated by the district court.  We\r\n\nadd  that   the  same  facts  which   justified  Williams  in\r\n\nconcluding that Tarabolski required protective  custody would\r\n\nalso  justify  a  reasonable  officer in  believing  that  an\r\n\nemergency warrantless  entry was appropriate.   See Mincey v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nArizona,  437 U.S.  385, 392-93 (1978)  (discussing emergency\r                   \r\n\nexception to  warrant requirement); Sheik-Abdi  v. McClellan,\r                                                                        \r\n\n37  F.3d 1240, 1244 (7th Cir. 1994) (same), cert. denied, 115\r                                                                    \r\n\nS. Ct.  937 (1995).   Under  the circumstances,  the district\r\n\ncourt  did not  err in  ruling that  Williams is  entitled to\r\n\nqualified immunity.   See Hegarty v. Somerset County, 53 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n1367, 1372-79 (1st Cir. 1995) (qualified immunity affords law\r\n\nenforcement officials  a  safe  haven  where  the  challenged\r\n\nconduct is objectively reasonable).\r\n\n     We have carefully considered Tarabolski's  objections to\r\n\nvarious interim rulings of the district court and reject them\r\n\nas without merit.   We note, in particular, that  there is no\r\n\nabsolute constitutional  right to  a free  lawyer in  a civil\r\n\ncase,   see  DesRosiers v. Moran,  949 F.2d 15,  23 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1991), and we  find no  abuse of discretion  in the  district\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ncourt's denial of  Tarabolski's requests for  court-appointed\r\n\ncounsel.   Finally, we add that to the extent that Tarabolski\r\n\nseeks  relief  from  judgment   under  Rule  60(b)  based  on\r\n\nallegations   of  fraud,  such  a  request  is  appropriately\r\n\naddressed to the district court.  \r\n\n     Affirmed.  No costs.\r                          \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
