This  appeal  requires us  to\n          SELYA,  Circuit  Judge.\n                                \n\nconsider whether  civil rights actions can  be maintained against\n\nmilitary officers  in the chain  of command  by persons  employed\n\nunder the National Guard Technician Act of 1968 (Technician Act),\n\n32  U.S.C.    709  (1988).   The  district court  granted summary\n\njudgment   because   it   deemed   plaintiff's   claims   to   be\n\nnonjusticiable.   See  Wright v. Park,  811 F. Supp.  726 (D. Me.\n                                     \n\n1993).  Although  our reasoning  differs from that  of the  court\n\nbelow, we affirm.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          The  facts,  insofar  as   they  are  germane  to  this\n\nproceeding,  are  not  seriously disputed.    Plaintiff-appellant\n\nRichard L. Wright served  from 1970 to 1990  in a dual  civilian-\n\nmilitary capacity as a technician at the Air National Guard (ANG)\n\nbase  in Bangor,  Maine.   Wearing  his  civilian hat,  appellant\n\nserved during the  last three years of the period  as an aircraft\n\nmaintenance  specialist.   Wearing  his military  hat, he  served\n\nduring  that same  period  as deputy  commander for  maintenance,\n\n101st Air  Refueling Wing, and as a colonel in the Maine ANG.  In\n\nthese  positions, appellant supervised  approximately 450 persons\n\nattached to the maintenance unit, including 130 technicians.  His\n\nprimary  mission was to keep  Bangor-based military aircraft in a\n\nstate of combat preparedness, and to train others to do the same.\n\n          On March  2, 1990,  Major General Ernest  Park notified\n\nappellant  of his  forthcoming  reassignment to  the position  of\n\nflight  instructor.    In  compliance  with  Technician Personnel\n\n                                2\n\nRegulation No. 15,  2-5,1  Park's letter informed appellant that,\n\nif  he abjured reassignment, the letter itself would be deemed to\n\noperate as  a  30-day  termination  notice.   Appellant  did  not\n\nwelcome  the news:  while the proposed shift in duties endangered\n\nneither his pay nor his benefits,  it promised to remove him from\n\nthe  maintenance  unit  and  divorce  him  from  all  supervisory\n\nresponsibilities.      Consequently,   appellant   rejected   the\n\nreassignment.  In due course, the threatened termination became a\n\nreality.  Park  relieved appellant  of his duties  as a  civilian\n\naircraft  maintenance  specialist  and  as deputy  commander  for\n\nmaintenance, while leaving intact his military rank.\n\n          His  several  hats  askew,  appellant  brought  suit in\n\nfederal district court against General Park and others presumably\n\nresponsible  for cashiering him.   He  claimed that  his habitual\n\nwhistleblowing   during his tenure as maintenance officer, he had\n\nfiled  repeated reports of safety violations, as well as a report\n\ncharging  General  Park with  the  unauthorized  use of  military\n\naircraft   prompted a cabal of high-ranking officers to retaliate\n\nagainst him and,  ultimately, strip him of his job.2   His second\n\namended complaint  (the  operative  document  for  our  purposes)\n\nalleges  that the named defendants    Generals Park, Eremita, and\n\n                    \n\n     1Regulation No.  15, promulgated  by the Secretaries  of the\nArmy and Air Force pursuant to 32 U.S.C.   709(a) (1988),  covers\na wide range of personnel matters.  Section 2-5 thereof addresses\nnon-disciplinary,  management-directed  reassignments of  persons\nemployed under the Technician Act.\n\n     2Defendants deny these  charges, contending that appellant's\nreassignment  was justified  by  discipline problems  within  the\nmaintenance unit and by the need to bolster flagging morale.\n\n                                3\n\nDurgin, and  Colonel Hessert   thereby violated  the Civil Rights\n\nAct, 42  U.S.C.    1983,  1985 (1988), the  federal whistleblower\n\nstatute,   5  U.S.C.        2301-2302  (1988),   and  the   state\n\nwhistleblower law, 26 M.R.S.A.    831-840 (1988).\n\n          The federal district court consolidated the case with a\n\nrelated  case.3    On   January  26,  1993,  the  court   granted\n\ndefendants'  motion for  summary judgment,  holding  in substance\n\nthat the dispute concerned a nonjusticiable military controversy.\n\nSee Wright v. Park, 811 F. Supp.  at 732.  It reached this result\n                  \n\nby applying  the analytic framework first suggested  in Mindes v.\n                                                              \n\nSeaman, 453  F.2d 197, 201-02  (5th Cir. 1971),  and subsequently\n      \n\nadopted by this court in Penagaricano v. Llenza, 747 F.2d 55, 60-\n                                               \n\n61 (1st Cir. 1984).\n\n          The appeal  from the district court's judgment presents\n\na pair of interrelated  issues:  separability and justiciability.\n\nThus,  we   must  make   two  inquiries:     Assuming  defendants\n\ndiscriminated against  appellant, can  appellant be said  to have\n\nsuffered injury in his capacity as a civilian worker, independent\n\nof  his military  role?    (2) If  not,  i.e.,  if appellant  was\n                                             \n\n                    \n\n     3An investigator for the Maine Human Rights Commission found\nreason  to   believe   that  defendants   discriminated   against\nappellant, and the Commission joined with appellant to bring suit\nin federal district court.   A parallel state action  was removed\nto federal court and then consolidated with  the original action.\nAfter  the Maine  Supreme  Judicial  Court  held that  the  state\nwhistleblower law  does not pertain to  National Guard personnel,\nsee  Maine  Human  Rights Comm'n  v.  Maine  Dep't  of Defense  &amp;\n                                                                 \nVeterans'  Servs.,  627  A.2d  1005 (Me.  1993),  the  Commission\n                 \ndropped  its appeal from the  judgment below.   The parties agree\nthat the state-law issues  are now moot and, consequently,  we do\nnot address them.\n\n                                4\n\ninjured, rather, in  his military capacity,  can his injury  form\n\nthe  basis  for a  justiciable  civil  rights claim  against  the\n\ndefendants (all  of whom are  military officers)?   To complicate\n\nmatters, answering the  second query will require us to reexamine\n\nour governing precedent on justiciability in light of recent case\n\nlaw elsewhere.\n\nII.  AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN\n\n          Appellant,  who remains  a colonel  in the  ANG, argues\n\nstrenuously that, for purposes of  this case, his civilian status\n\nmay  be disentangled from his military status, and that he should\n\nbe  free to sue for  discrimination implicating the  former.  But\n\nthis balkanization  of technicians' work is  belied by Congress's\n\ndescription  of the functions that  ANG technicians serve, by the\n\nunmistakable intendment  of the Technician Act  (the statute that\n\nCongress  enacted in 1968 to regulate such personnel), and by the\n\nresulting  ties  that  bind technicians'  civilian  and  military\n\nroles.\n\n          The  Technician  Act  makes  technicians  eligible  for\n\nmilitary employment  benefits and, in so doing,  seeks to improve\n\nnational  security by  facilitating the recruitment  of qualified\n\nindividuals.   See American Fed'n of Gov't Employees v. FLRA, 730\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  1534,  1542-47  (D.C.  Cir.  1984)  (analyzing  legislative\n\nhistory).  The Act provides in relevant part that persons may  be\n\nemployed as technicians  only \"[u]nder regulations prescribed  by\n\nthe Secretary  of  the [relevant  military branch].  . .  .\"   32\n\nU.S.C.   709(a).  Each such technician \"shall, while so employed,\n\n                                5\n\nbe  a member of  the National Guard  and hold the  military grade\n\nspecified  by the  Secretary concerned  for that  position.\"   32\n\nU.S.C.     709(b).    In  substance,  then,  the  Technician  Act\n\nevidences  Congress's intention that technicians, while retaining\n\ntheir positions as civil  employees outside the competitive civil\n\nservice,  will   serve  simultaneously   as   employees  of   the\n\nappropriate military department, subject to its regulation.\n\n          It  is axiomatic that the National Guard is military in\n\ncharacter.   See  H.R.  Rep.  No.  1823,  90th  Cong.  2d  Sess.,\n                \n\nreprinted  in  1968  U.S.C.C.A.N.  3318,  3319  (recognizing  the\n             \n\n\"military characteristics of  the National Guard\").   We think it\n\nfollows that technicians are martial in character.  Indeed, under\n\nthe   Technician  Act's   composite   regime,   technicians   are\n\nconsiderably   more  than   nominal  members   of   the  military\n\nestablishment.   In  referring to  the National  Guard's mission,\n\nCongress termed it \"essential\"  as a matter of  \"military policy\"\n\nthat \"the strength and organization of the [National Guard] as an\n\nintegral part  of the first line defenses of the United States be\n\nmaintained and assured at all times.\"  32 U.S.C.    102.  Because\n\nNational Guard technicians serve as the Guard's support staff and\n\nare, in  fact, those whose job  it is to maintain  and assure the\n\nGuard's strength and organization, they are indispensable to this\n\nnation's  defense.  See, e.g.,  32 U.S.C.    709(a) (assigning to\n                             \n\ntechnicians  such  distinctively  military  tasks   as  \"(1)  the\n\nadministration and training  of the National  Guard; and (2)  the\n\nmaintenance and repair  of supplies issued to the  National Guard\n\n                                6\n\nor the armed services\").  Nor do technicians merely perform tasks\n\nthat have a military ring to them; the record reflects that fully\n\none-half  of appellant's  outfit, the  101st Air  Refueling Wing,\n\nserved in Operation Desert Storm or Desert Shield.\n\n          Given this  mise-en-scene, it is  unsurprising that, no\n                                   \n\nmatter  the  context,  every  court having  occasion  closely  to\n\nconsider  the   capacity  of   National  Guard  technicians   has\n\ndetermined that  capacity to  be irreducibly military  in nature.\n\nSee, e.g., Stauber v. Cline, 837 F.2d 395, 399 (9th  Cir.), cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied,  488 U.S. 817 (1988);  Illinois Nat'l Guard  v. FLRA, 854\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 1396, 1398  (D.C. Cir.  1988); American Fed'n,  730 F.2d  at\n                                                  \n\n1545-46; New Jersey Air  Nat'l Guard v.  FLRA, 677 F.2d 276,  279\n                                             \n\n(3d  Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 988 (1982); Nesmith v. Fulton,\n                                                                \n\n615  F.2d 196, 200-01  (5th Cir. 1980).   We, too, conclude that,\n\nsince  National  Guard  technicians'  positions  are  encompassed\n\nwithin  a military  organization and  require the  performance of\n\nwork  directly related  to national  defense, such  positions are\n\nthemselves military in nature.\n\n          Appellant strives valiantly to  elude the grasp of this\n\nlogic.  He says that his situation is different; it falls outside\n\nthe mine  run of  previous cases because  he was ousted  from his\n\ncivilian employment  without being  terminated from  his military\n\npost.  This asseveration cannot withstand scrutiny.\n\n          For  one  thing,  appellant  mischaracterizes  his  own\n\nsituation:  though he retains his commission as  a colonel in the\n\nANG, the  injury  of which  he  complains has  had  repercussions\n\n                                7\n\nbeyond  the  loss  of his  civilian  mantle.   He  also  has been\n\ndismissed from the post  of deputy commander for maintenance    a\n\npost which he admits is  military in nature.  For another  thing,\n\nappellant's self-portrait, even as  he has painted it, is  not an\n\noriginal.    In  Nesmith,  for example,  the  plaintiff  lost his\n                        \n\ncivilian  post prior to the  eventual loss of  his military post.\n\nNesmith, 615 F.2d  at 197.   The court took  care to analyze  the\n       \n\ninitial dismissal independently, yet  reached the same conclusion\n\nas  other courts  that  have considered  the  question:   an  ANG\n\ntechnician's  two identities are not  scissile.  See  id. at 201;\n                                                         \n\nsee  also  Stauber,  837 F.2d  at  399  (holding  that an  injury\n                  \n\noccurring in the course of plaintiff's civilian employment  as an\n\nANG  technician  arose incident  to  military  service); cf.  New\n                                                                 \n\nJersey  Air  Nat'l  Guard, 677  F.2d  at  279  (holding that  the\n                         \n\nTechnician Act grants adjutants general final discretion relating\n\nto discipline and discharge of ANG technicians).\n\n          We  rule, therefore, that while a technician's job is a\n\ncomposite, containing  both  civilian and  military  pieces,  the\n\njob's dual aspects are inseparable; they are, like Chang and Eng,\n\njoined at the  chest.  And  from the fact  that the  technician's\n\nseveral roles  are inextricably intertwined, it  follows that the\n\nadverse   employment  action  against  which  appellant  inveighs\n\nnecessarily  implicates  his military  as  well  as his  civilian\n\nstatus.  In other words, Colonel Wright, for present purposes, is\n\nboth an officer and a gentleman.\n\nIII.  NO CLEARANCE FOR TAKEOFF\n\n                                8\n\n          Having   answered  the  separability  question  in  the\n\nnegative,  we  proceed to  the  question  of justiciability.  The\n\ntouchstone  of our inquiry is  Chappell v. Wallace,  462 U.S. 296\n                                                  \n\n(1983).    Chappell  held  that  \"[t]aken  together,  the  unique\n                   \n\ndisciplinary   structure  of   the  Military   Establishment  and\n\nCongress'  activity  in the  field  constitute `special  factors'\n\nwhich dictate that it would be  inappropriate to provide enlisted\n\nmilitary  personnel  with  a  Bivens-type  remedy  against  their\n                                    \n\nsuperior  officers.\"    Id.  at 304  (citation  omitted).4    The\n                           \n\nChappell Court  placed particular emphasis on the  first of these\n        \n\ntwo factors:\n\n          The  special nature  of  military life    the\n          need for unhesitating and decisive  action by\n          military  officers  and  equally  disciplined\n          responses  by enlisted  personnel    would be\n          undermined  by  a  judicially created  remedy\n          exposing  officers  to personal  liability at\n          the  hands  of  those  they  are  charged  to\n          command.

Bivens  is the case\n                                                    \nestablishing,  as  a  general  proposition,  that  victims  of  a\nconstitutional violation  perpetrated by a federal  actor may sue\nthe  offender for damages in federal court despite the absence of\nexplicit statutory authorization for such suits.  See  Carlson v.\n                                                              \nGreen, 446 U.S. 14, 18 (1980) (restating Bivens rule); Morales v.\n                                                              \nRamirez, 906 F.2d 784, 786 (1st Cir. 1990) (same).\n       \n\n                                9\n\nvigorously debated  whether to  read  it narrowly,  based on  its\n\nholding, or  to read  it broadly,  based on  its reasoning.

Within\n                                   \n\na year  after Chappell emerged, this  court decided Penagaricano,\n                                                                \n\n747 F.2d  55, a case  involving facts  similar to  those we  sift\n\ntoday.  There, an ANG technician, having been discharged, alleged\n\na conspiracy  to  end  his  employment  in  retaliation  for  his\n\npolitical ideas  and affiliations.  See id.  at 58.  In upholding\n                                           \n\nthe dismissal of plaintiff's claim, we took pains to  acknowledge\n\nthe relevance  of Chappell's emphasis  on \"the importance  of the\n                          \n\nmilitary's decisionmaking autonomy,\" id. at 59, took into account\n                                        \n\nthe   factors  identified  by  Chappell  as  counselling  against\n                                       \n\njusticiability in the military context,  id. at 59-60, and  noted\n                                            \n\nthat Chappell suggested a \"predisposition to decline review,\" id.\n                                                                 \n\nat  64.   Nevertheless,  believing that  the holding  in Chappell\n                                                                 \n\nshould be  confined to  the context of  enlisted personnel  suing\n\nsuperior  officers, we  declined to  cede it  controlling effect.\n\nSee id. at 59.  Thus, although we ultimately found Penagaricano's\n       \n\nclaim to be nonjusticiable, we based that finding not on Chappell\n                                                                 \n\nbut on an application of the  balancing test limned by the  Fifth\n\nCircuit in Mindes,  453 F.2d  at 201-02.

While conceding that \"no holding can\n\nbe broader than the facts before it,\" and that some of Chappell's\n                                                               \n\nlanguage focused explicitly on the officer/subordinate dichotomy,\n\nid. at 680, the Stanley Court pointed out that Chappell had self-\n                                                       \n\nconsciously patterned its  analysis after Feres    the case  that\n                                               \n\nbarred tort liability  for injuries that \"arise out of  or are in\n\nthe course of activity incident to [military] service.\"  Stanley,\n                                                                \n\n483 U.S. at  684 (quoting Feres,  340 U.S. at  146).  Given  this\n                               \n\nsymbiotic  relationship between Feres  and Chappell,  the Stanley\n                                                                 \n\nCourt concluded  that the Chappell  approach should apply  to all\n                                  \n\nactivities performed \"incident to  service\" rather than merely to\n\nactivities  performed  within  the   officer/subordinate  sphere.\n\nStanley, 483 U.S. at  680-81.  In this sense,  then, Stanley both\n                                                            \n\n\"reaffirm[ed]  the reasoning  of  Chappell,\" id.  at 683-84,  and\n                                                \n\nwidened the scope of its holding.\n\n          Of  critical importance  for present  purposes, Stanley\n                                                                 \n\nmakes pellucid that the exception to Bivens liability established\n                                           \n\nby Chappell is  coextensive with the exception  to tort liability\n           \n\nestablished by Feres and its progeny.5  Consequently,  \"no Bivens\n                                                                 \n\nremedy is available for injuries that \"arise out of or are in the\n\n                    \n\n     5To   call   the  Feres   doctrine   an   exception  is   an\n                            \noversimplification.    Feres is  a  judge-made  exception to  the\n                            \nFederal Tort Claims  Act, 28  U.S.C.    1346,  2671-2680 (1988  &amp;\nSupp.  II 1990), itself a statutory  waiver of sovereign immunity\nfrom  tort liability.  Thus, if tort liability is the rule, Feres\n                                                                 \ncreated an exception to an exception to an exception.\n\n                                11\n\ncourse of activity  incident to service.\"   Id. at  684.  We  now\n                                               \n\njoin several of our sister circuits in accepting this bright-line\n\nrule  as the definitive statement on  the justiciability of civil\n\nrights  claims in  the military  context, including  the National\n\nGuard.6  And, being  reluctant to leave \"derelicts on  the waters\n\nof  the law,\" Alabama Pub.

United  States, 978  F.2d 614,  615\n                                            \n(10th  Cir. 1992); Kitowski v.

We would add, moreover, that several courts, even without\nthe benefit  of Stanley's clarification of  Chappell, anticipated\n                                                    \nStanley  and  adopted a  per  se prohibition  of  damages actions\n                                \nbrought  against  military  officers  for alleged  violations  of\nsubordinates'  civil rights.  See, e.g., Jorden, 799 F.2d at 107;\n                                               \nTrerice  v.

Most\n                                   \nsignificantly for our purposes,  the Fifth Circuit, progenitor of\nthe Mindes multifactor test, has abandoned that approach in favor\n          \nof a per se prohibition.  See Crawford v. Texas Army Nat'l Guard,\n                                                                \n794 F.2d 1034,  1036 (5th Cir. 1986).  In  short, Mindes has been\n                                                        \nbanished from its homeland.\n\n     7Although  panel  decisions  of this  court  are  ordinarily\nbinding on newly constituted panels, that rule does not obtain in\ninstances where, as here, a departure is compelled by controlling\nauthority.  In such relatively rare instances, we  have sometimes\nchosen  to  circulate  the  proposed overruling  opinion  to  all\nmembers of the court prior to publication even though the need to\noverrule  precedent  is reasonably  clear.    See, e.g.,  Trailer\n                                                                 \nMarine Transport Corp. v. Rivera Vazquez, 977 F.2d 1, 9 n.5  (1st\n                                        \nCir. 1992).  This procedure is, of course, informal, and does not\npreclude a suggestion of rehearing en banc on any issue.\n\n     We have followed that  praxis here and can report  that none\nof the judges of this court has objected to the  panel's analysis\nor to  its conclusion  that the justiciability  regime limned  in\nPenagaricano has outlived its usefulness as precedent.  \n            \n\n                                12\n\n          Of course,  Wright's suit invoked the  Civil Rights Act\n\nrather  than following the Bivens  route.  But  absent a specific\n                                 \n\nstatutory provision to the contrary, there is no principled basis\n\nfor  according state  actors  sued  under  42  U.S.C.     1983  a\n\ndifferent  degree  of immunity  than  would  be accorded  federal\n\nactors sued  for an identical abridgement of rights under Bivens.\n                                                                \n\nSee Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 500 (1978).   Thus, while the\n                    \n\nStanley Court's clarification of Chappell occurred in the context\n                                         \n\nof  a  Bivens action,  Stanley can  only  be understood  to apply\n                              \n\nequally  to civil  rights  claims against  state officials  under\n\nsection 1983 and, for  that matter, under kindred statutes.   See\n                                                                 \n\nWatson v. Arkansas  Nat'l Guard,  886 F.2d 1004,  1007 (8th  Cir.\n                               \n\n1989) (collecting  cases construing Chappell rule  to cover suits\n                                            \n\nbrought under section 1983).   The federal whistleblower statute,\n\n5 U.S.C.    2301-2302, relied on by appellant in association with\n\nhis  civil  rights claims,  is a  statute that  falls comfortably\n\nwithin this generality.   Hence, the district court appropriately\n\ndeclined to clear the case for trial.\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We need go no further.  Since a technician's dual roles\n\nare  too tightly  imbricated to  be pried  apart at  a litigant's\n\nwhim,  appellant  necessarily suffered  the  injury  of which  he\n\ncomplains in his military capacity.  See supra Part II.  For that\n                                              \n\nreason, the injury arose incident to military service.  See supra\n                                                                 \n\nPart III.   In these circumstances,  Stanley applies, and,  under\n                                            \n\nthe  Stanley   rule,  the   statements  of  claim   contained  in\n            \n\n                                13\n\nappellant's   second  amended   complaint   fail   the  test   of\n\njusticiability.8\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                    \n\n     8Because appellant's  suit  is nonjusticiable,  we need  not\nconsider other potential deficiencies  in appellant's case, e.g.,\n                                                                \nwhether the defendants can  be said to have acted  under color of\nstate law.\n\n                                14\n",

Sec. 709 (1988).  The district court granted summary judgment because it deemed plaintiff's claims to be nonjusticiable.  See Wright v. Park, 811 F.Supp. 726 (D.Me.1993).  Although our reasoning differs from that of the court below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts, insofar as they are germane to this proceeding, are not seriously disputed.  Plaintiff-appellant Richard L. Wright served from 1970 to 1990 in a dual civilian-military capacity as a technician at the Air National Guard (ANG) base in Bangor, Maine.  Wearing his civilian hat, appellant served during the last three years of the period as an aircraft maintenance specialist.  Wearing his military hat, he served during that same period as deputy commander for maintenance, 101st Air Refueling Wing, and as a colonel in the Maine ANG.  In these positions, appellant supervised approximately 450 persons attached to the maintenance unit, including 130 technicians.  His primary mission was to keep Bangor-based military aircraft in a state of combat preparedness, and to train others to do the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 2, 1990, Major General Ernest Park notified appellant of his forthcoming reassignment to the position of flight instructor.  In compliance with Technician Personnel Regulation No. 15, Sec. 2-5,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Park's letter informed appellant that, if he abjured reassignment, the letter itself would be deemed to operate as a 30-day termination notice.  Appellant did not welcome the news:  while the proposed shift in duties endangered neither his pay nor his benefits, it promised to remove him from the maintenance unit and divorce him from all supervisory responsibilities.  Consequently, appellant rejected the reassignment.  In due course, the threatened termination became a reality.  Park relieved appellant of his duties as a civilian aircraft maintenance specialist and as deputy commander for maintenance, while leaving intact his military rank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">His several hats askew, appellant brought suit in federal district court against General Park and others presumably responsible for cashiering him.  He claimed that his habitual whistleblowing-during his tenure as maintenance officer, he had filed repeated reports of safety violations, as well as a report charging General Park with the unauthorized use of military aircraft-prompted a cabal of high-ranking officers to retaliate against him and, ultimately, strip him of his job.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  His second amended complaint (the operative document for our purposes) alleges that the named defendants--Generals Park, Eremita, and Durgin, and Colonel Hessert--thereby violated the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1983, 1985 (1988), the federal whistleblower statute, 5 U.S.C. Secs. 2301-2302 (1988), and the state whistleblower law, 26 M.R.S.A. Secs. 831-840 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal district court consolidated the case with a related case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  On January 26, 1993, the court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment, holding in substance that the dispute concerned a nonjusticiable military controversy.  SeeWright v. Park, 811 F.Supp. at 732.   It reached this result by applying the analytic framework first suggested in Mindes v. Seaman, 453 F.2d 197, 201-02 (5th Cir.1971), and subsequently adopted by this court in Penagaricano v. Llenza, 747 F.2d 55, 60-61 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal from the district court's judgment presents a pair of interrelated issues:  separability and justiciability.  Thus, we must make two inquiries:  (1) Assuming defendants discriminated against appellant, can appellant be said to have suffered injury in his capacity as a civilian worker, independent of his military role?  (2) If not, i.e., if appellant was injured, rather, in his military capacity, can his injury form the basis for a justiciable civil rights claim against the defendants (all of whom are military officers)?   To complicate matters, answering the second query will require us to reexamine our governing precedent on justiciability in light of recent case law elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant, who remains a colonel in the ANG, argues strenuously that, for purposes of this case, his civilian status may be disentangled from his military status, and that he should be free to sue for discrimination implicating the former.  But this balkanization of technicians' work is belied by Congress's description of the functions that ANG technicians serve, by the unmistakable intendment of the Technician Act (the statute that Congress enacted in 1968 to regulate such personnel), and by the resulting ties that bind technicians' civilian and military roles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Technician Act makes technicians eligible for military employment benefits and, in so doing, seeks to improve national security by facilitating the recruitment of qualified individuals.  SeeAmerican Fed'n of Gov't Employees v. FLRA, 730 F.2d 1534, 1542-47 (D.C.Cir.1984) (analyzing legislative history).  The Act provides in relevant part that persons may be employed as technicians only \"[u]nder regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the [relevant military branch]....\"  32 U.S.C. Sec. 709(a).  Each such technician \"shall, while so employed, be a member of the National Guard and hold the military grade specified by the Secretary concerned for that position.\"  32 U.S.C. Sec. 709(b).  In substance, then, the Technician Act evidences Congress's intention that technicians, while retaining their positions as civil employees outside the competitive civil service, will serve simultaneously as employees of the appropriate military department, subject to its regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is axiomatic that the National Guard is military in character.  See H.R.Rep. No. 1823, 90th Cong.2d Sess., reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3318, 3319 (recognizing the \"military characteristics of the National Guard\").  We think it follows that technicians are martial in character.  Indeed, under the Technician Act's composite regime, technicians are considerably more than nominal members of the military establishment.  In referring to the National Guard's mission, Congress termed it \"essential\" as a matter of \"military policy\" that \"the strength and organization of the [National Guard] as an integral part of the first line defenses of the United States be maintained and assured at all times.\"  32 U.S.C. Sec. 102.  Because National Guard technicians serve as the Guard's support staff and are, in fact, those whose job it is to maintain and assure the Guard's strength and organization, they are indispensable to this nation's defense.  See, e.g., 32 U.S.C. Sec. 709(a) (assigning to technicians such distinctively military tasks as \"(1) the administration and training of the National Guard;  and (2) the maintenance and repair of supplies issued to the National Guard or the armed forces\").  Nor do technicians merely perform tasks that have a military ring to them;  the record reflects that fully one-half of appellant's outfit, the 101st Air Refueling Wing, served in Operation Desert Storm or Desert Shield.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this mise-en-scene, it is unsurprising that, no matter the context, every court having occasion closely to consider the capacity of National Guard technicians has determined that capacity to be irreducibly military in nature.  See, e.g.,Stauber v. Cline, 837 F.2d 395, 399 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 817, 109 S.Ct. 55, 102 L.Ed.2d 33 (1988);  Illinois Nat'l Guard v. FLRA, 854 F.2d 1396, 1398 (D.C.Cir.1988);  American Fed'n, 730 F.2d at 1545-46;  New Jersey Air Nat'l Guard v. FLRA, 677 F.2d 276, 279 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 988, 103 S.Ct. 343, 74 L.Ed.2d 384 (1982);  Nesmith v. Fulton, 615 F.2d 196, 200-01 (5th Cir.1980).  We, too, conclude that, since National Guard technicians' positions are encompassed within a military organization and require the performance of work directly related to national defense, such positions are themselves military in nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant strives valiantly to elude the grasp of this logic.  He says that his situation is different;  it falls outside the mine run of previous cases because he was ousted from his civilian employment without being terminated from his military post.  This asseveration cannot withstand scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For one thing, appellant mischaracterizes his own situation:  though he retains his commission as a colonel in the ANG, the injury of which he complains has had repercussions beyond the loss of his civilian mantle.  He also has been dismissed from the post of deputy commander for maintenance--a post which he admits is military in nature.  For another thing, appellant's self-portrait, even as he has painted it, is not an original.  In Nesmith, for example, the plaintiff lost his civilian post prior to the eventual loss of his military post.  Nesmith, 615 F.2d at 197.   The court took care to analyze the initial dismissal independently, yet reached the same conclusion as other courts that have considered the question:  an ANG technician's two identities are not scissile.  Seeid. at 201;  see alsoStauber, 837 F.2d at 399 (holding that an injury occurring in the course of plaintiff's civilian employment as an ANG technician arose incident to military service);  cf. New Jersey Air Nat'l Guard, 677 F.2d at 279 (holding that the Technician Act grants adjutants general final discretion relating to discipline and discharge of ANG technicians).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rule, therefore, that while a technician's job is a composite, containing both civilian and military pieces, the job's dual aspects are inseparable;  they are, like Chang and Eng, joined at the chest.  And from the fact that the technician's several roles are inextricably intertwined, it follows that the adverse employment action against which appellant inveighs necessarily implicates his military as well as his civilian status.  In other words, Colonel Wright, for present purposes, is both an officer and a gentleman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. NO CLEARANCE FOR TAKEOFF</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having answered the separability question in the negative, we proceed to the question of justiciability.  The touchstone of our inquiry is Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U.S. 296, 103 S.Ct. 2362, 76 L.Ed.2d 586 (1983).  Chappell held that \"[t]aken together, the unique disciplinary structure of the Military Establishment and Congress' activity in the field constitute 'special factors' which dictate that it would be inappropriate to provide enlisted military personnel with a Bivens-type remedy against their superior officers.\"  Id. 462 U.S. at 304, 103 S.Ct. at 2367 (citation omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The Chappell Court placed particular emphasis on the first of these two factors:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>The special nature of military life--the need for unhesitating and decisive action by military officers and equally disciplined responses by enlisted personnel--would be undermined by a judicially created remedy exposing officers to personal liability at the hands of those they are charged to command.  Here, as in Feres [v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950) ], we must be \"concern[ed] with the disruption of '[t]he peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to his superiors' that might result if the soldier were allowed to hale his superiors into court.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chappell broke new ground, and courts across the nation vigorously debated whether to read it narrowly, based on its holding, or to read it broadly, based on its reasoning.  SeeJorden v. National Guard Bureau, 799 F.2d 99, 107 (3d Cir.1986) (surveying case law), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 815, 108 S.Ct. 66, 98 L.Ed.2d 30 (1987).  Within a year after Chappell emerged, this court decided Penagaricano, 747 F.2d 55, a case involving facts similar to those we sift today.  There, an ANG technician, having been discharged, alleged a conspiracy to end his employment in retaliation for his political ideas and affiliations.  Seeid. at 58.   In upholding the dismissal of plaintiff's claim, we took pains to acknowledge the relevance of Chappell 's emphasis on \"the importance of the military's decisionmaking autonomy,\" id. at 59, took into account the factors identified by Chappell as counselling against justiciability in the military context, id. at 59-60, and noted that Chappell suggested a \"predisposition to decline review,\" id. at 64.   Nevertheless, believing that the holding in Chappell should be confined to the context of enlisted personnel suing superior officers, we declined to cede it controlling effect.  Seeid. at 59.   Thus, although we ultimately found Penagaricano's claim to be nonjusticiable, we based that finding not on Chappell but on an application of the balancing test limned by the Fifth Circuit in Mindes, 453 F.2d at 201-02.   SeePenagaricano, 747 F.2d at 60-61.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Time has shed new light on the debate over Chappell 's doctrinal reach.  In United States v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 669, 107 S.Ct. 3054, 97 L.Ed.2d 550 (1987)--a case which the Court accepted for review specifically to resolve the controversy over the proper dimensions of Chappell, seeid. at 676, 107 S.Ct. at 3060--the Justices came down on the side of the broad constructionists.  While conceding that \"no holding can be broader than the facts before it,\" and that some of Chappell 's language focused explicitly on the officer/subordinate dichotomy, id. at 680, 107 S.Ct. at 3062, the Stanley Court pointed out that Chappell had self-consciously patterned its analysis after Feres--the case that barred tort liability for injuries that \"arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to [military] service.\"  Stanley, 483 U.S. at 684, 107 S.Ct. at 3064 (quoting Feres, 340 U.S. at 146, 71 S.Ct. at 159).   Given this symbiotic relationship between Feres and Chappell, the Stanley Court concluded that the Chappell approach should apply to all activities performed \"incident to service\" rather than merely to activities performed within the officer/subordinate sphere.  Stanley, 483 U.S. at 680-81, 107 S.Ct. at 3061-62.   In this sense, then, Stanley both \"reaffirm[ed] the reasoning of Chappell,\"id. at 683-84, 107 S.Ct. at 3063-64, and widened the scope of its holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of critical importance for present purposes, Stanley makes pellucid that the exception to Bivens liability established by Chappell is coextensive with the exception to tort liability established by Feres and its progeny.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Consequently, \"no Bivens remedy is available for injuries that \"arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.\"  Id. at 684, 107 S.Ct. at 3064.   We now join several of our sister circuits in accepting this bright-line rule as the definitive statement on the justiciability of civil rights claims in the military context, including the National Guard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  And, being reluctant to leave \"derelicts on the waters of the law,\" Alabama Pub. Serv.  Comm'n v. Southern Ry. Co., 341 U.S. 341, 357, 71 S.Ct. 762, 772, 95 L.Ed. 1002 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring), we overrule Penagaricano to the extent that it mandates a different rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, Wright's suit invoked the Civil Rights Act rather than following the Bivens route.  But absent a specific statutory provision to the contrary, there is no principled basis for according state actors sued under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 a different degree of immunity than would be accorded federal actors sued for an identical abridgement of rights under Bivens.   SeeButz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 500, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 2907, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978).  Thus, while the Stanley Court's clarification of Chappell occurred in the context of a Bivens action, Stanley can only be understood to apply equally to civil rights claims against state officials under section 1983 and, for that matter, under kindred statutes.  SeeWatson v. Arkansas Nat'l Guard, 886 F.2d 1004, 1007 (8th Cir.1989) (collecting cases construing Chappell rule to cover suits brought under section 1983).  The federal whistleblower statute, 5 U.S.C. Secs. 2301-2302, relied on by appellant in association with his civil rights claims, is a statute that falls comfortably within this generality.  Hence, the district court appropriately declined to clear the case for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Since a technician's dual roles are too tightly imbricated to be pried apart at a litigant's whim, appellant necessarily suffered the injury of which he complains in his military capacity.  See supra Part II.  For that reason, the injury arose incident to military service.  See supra Part III.  In these circumstances, Stanley applies, and, under the Stanley rule, the statements of claim contained in appellant's second amended complaint fail the test of justiciability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Regulation No. 15, promulgated by the Secretaries of the Army and Air Force pursuant to 32 U.S.C.

A parallel state action was removed to federal court and then consolidated with the original action.  After the Maine Supreme Judicial Court held that the state whistleblower law does not pertain to National Guard personnel, seeMaine Human Rights Comm'n v. Maine Dep't of Defense &amp; Veterans' Servs., 627 A.2d 1005 (Me.1993), the Commission dropped its appeal from the judgment below.

Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).  Bivens is the case establishing, as a general proposition, that victims of a constitutional violation perpetrated by a federal actor may sue the offender for damages in federal court despite the absence of explicit statutory authorization for such suits.  SeeCarlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 18, 100 S.Ct. 1468, 64 L.Ed.2d 15 (1980) (restating Bivens rule);  Morales v.

Arkansas Nat'l Guard, 886 F.2d 1004, 1006-07, 1009-10 (8th Cir.1989).  We would add, moreover, that several courts, even without the benefit of Stanley &#167; clarification of Chappell, anticipated Stanley and adopted a per se prohibition of damages actions brought against military officers for alleged violations of subordinates' civil rights.  See, e.g.,Jorden, 799 F.2d at 107;  Trerice v. Summons, 755 F.2d 1081, 1084 (4th Cir.1985);  Mollnow v.

Most significantly for our purposes, the Fifth Circuit, progenitor of the Mindes multifactor test, has abandoned that approach in favor of a per se prohibition.  SeeCrawford v. Texas Army Nat'l Guard, 794 F.2d 1034, 1036 (5th Cir.1986).

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts, insofar as they are germane to this proceeding, are not seriously disputed.  Plaintiff-appellant Richard L. Wright served from 1970 to 1990 in a dual civilian-military capacity as a technician at the Air National Guard (ANG) base in Bangor, Maine.  Wearing his civilian hat, appellant served during the last three years of the period as an aircraft maintenance specialist.  Wearing his military hat, he served during that same period as deputy commander for maintenance, 101st Air Refueling Wing, and as a colonel in the Maine ANG.  In these positions, appellant supervised approximately 450 persons attached to the maintenance unit, including 130 technicians.  His primary mission was to keep Bangor-based military aircraft in a state of combat preparedness, and to train others to do the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 2, 1990, Major General Ernest Park notified appellant of his forthcoming reassignment to the position of flight instructor.  In compliance with Technician Personnel Regulation No. 15, Sec. 2-5,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Park's letter informed appellant that, if he abjured reassignment, the letter itself would be deemed to operate as a 30-day termination notice.  Appellant did not welcome the news:  while the proposed shift in duties endangered neither his pay nor his benefits, it promised to remove him from the maintenance unit and divorce him from all supervisory responsibilities.  Consequently, appellant rejected the reassignment.  In due course, the threatened termination became a reality.  Park relieved appellant of his duties as a civilian aircraft maintenance specialist and as deputy commander for maintenance, while leaving intact his military rank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">His several hats askew, appellant brought suit in federal district court against General Park and others presumably responsible for cashiering him.  He claimed that his habitual whistleblowing-during his tenure as maintenance officer, he had filed repeated reports of safety violations, as well as a report charging General Park with the unauthorized use of military aircraft-prompted a cabal of high-ranking officers to retaliate against him and, ultimately, strip him of his job.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  His second amended complaint (the operative document for our purposes) alleges that the named defendants--Generals Park, Eremita, and Durgin, and Colonel Hessert--thereby violated the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1983, 1985 (1988), the federal whistleblower statute, 5 U.S.C. Secs. 2301-2302 (1988), and the state whistleblower law, 26 M.R.S.A.

Thus, we must make two inquiries:  (1) Assuming defendants discriminated against appellant, can appellant be said to have suffered injury in his capacity as a civilian worker, independent of his military role?  (2) If not, i.e., if appellant was injured, rather, in his military capacity, can his injury form the basis for a justiciable civil rights claim against the defendants (all of whom are military officers)?   To complicate matters, answering the second query will require us to reexamine our governing precedent on justiciability in light of recent case law elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant, who remains a colonel in the ANG, argues strenuously that, for purposes of this case, his civilian status may be disentangled from his military status, and that he should be free to sue for discrimination implicating the former.  But this balkanization of technicians' work is belied by Congress's description of the functions that ANG technicians serve, by the unmistakable intendment of the Technician Act (the statute that Congress enacted in 1968 to regulate such personnel), and by the resulting ties that bind technicians' civilian and military roles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Technician Act makes technicians eligible for military employment benefits and, in so doing, seeks to improve national security by facilitating the recruitment of qualified individuals.  SeeAmerican Fed'n of Gov't Employees v. FLRA, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"433510\"><a href=\"/opinion/433510/american-federation-of-government-employees-afl-cio-local-2953-v-federal/\"><span class=\"volume\">730</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1534</span></a></span>, 1542-47 (D.C.Cir.1984) (analyzing legislative history).  The Act provides in relevant part that persons may be employed as technicians only \"[u]nder regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the [relevant military branch]....\"  32 U.S.C. Sec. 709(a).  Each such technician \"shall, while so employed, be a member of the National Guard and hold the military grade specified by the Secretary concerned for that position.\"  32 U.S.C. Sec. 709(b).  In substance, then, the Technician Act evidences Congress's intention that technicians, while retaining their positions as civil employees outside the competitive civil service, will serve simultaneously as employees of the appropriate military department, subject to its regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is axiomatic that the National Guard is military in character.  See H.R.Rep. No. 1823, 90th Cong.2d Sess., reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3318, 3319 (recognizing the \"military characteristics of the National Guard\").  We think it follows that technicians are martial in character.  Indeed, under the Technician Act's composite regime, technicians are considerably more than nominal members of the military establishment.  In referring to the National Guard's mission, Congress termed it \"essential\" as a matter of \"military policy\" that \"the strength and organization of the [National Guard] as an integral part of the first line defenses of the United States be maintained and assured at all times.\"  32 U.S.C. Sec. 102.  Because National Guard technicians serve as the Guard's support staff and are, in fact, those whose job it is to maintain and assure the Guard's strength and organization, they are indispensable to this nation's defense.  See, e.g., 32 U.S.C. Sec. 709(a) (assigning to technicians such distinctively military tasks as \"(1) the administration and training of the National Guard;  and (2) the maintenance and repair of supplies issued to the National Guard or the armed forces\").  Nor do technicians merely perform tasks that have a military ring to them;  the record reflects that fully one-half of appellant's outfit, the 101st Air Refueling Wing, served in Operation Desert Storm or Desert Shield.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this mise-en-scene, it is unsurprising that, no matter the context, every court having occasion closely to consider the capacity of National Guard technicians has determined that capacity to be irreducibly military in nature.

We, too, conclude that, since National Guard technicians' positions are encompassed within a military organization and require the performance of work directly related to national defense, such positions are themselves military in nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant strives valiantly to elude the grasp of this logic.  He says that his situation is different;  it falls outside the mine run of previous cases because he was ousted from his civilian employment without being terminated from his military post.  This asseveration cannot withstand scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For one thing, appellant mischaracterizes his own situation:  though he retains his commission as a colonel in the ANG, the injury of which he complains has had repercussions beyond the loss of his civilian mantle.  He also has been dismissed from the post of deputy commander for maintenance--a post which he admits is military in nature.  For another thing, appellant's self-portrait, even as he has painted it, is not an original.  In Nesmith, for example, the plaintiff lost his civilian post prior to the eventual loss of his military post.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"374691\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Nesmith,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/374691/charles-a-nesmith-v-clyde-e-fulton/\"><span class=\"volume\">615</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>.   The court took care to analyze the initial dismissal independently, yet reached the same conclusion as other courts that have considered the question:  an ANG technician's two identities are not scissile.  Seeid. at 201;  see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"500120\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">alsoStauber,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/500120/frederick-c-stauber-v-richard-a-cline-fred-c-scharper-ray-dugan-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">399</span> </a></span>(holding that an injury occurring in the course of plaintiff's civilian employment as an ANG technician arose incident to military service);  cf.

And from the fact that the technician's several roles are inextricably intertwined, it follows that the adverse employment action against which appellant inveighs necessarily implicates his military as well as his civilian status.  In other words, Colonel Wright, for present purposes, is both an officer and a gentleman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

But absent a specific statutory provision to the contrary, there is no principled basis for according state actors sued under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 a different degree of immunity than would be accorded federal actors sued for an identical abridgement of rights under Bivens.   SeeButz v. Economou, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109932\"><a href=\"/opinion/109932/butz-v-economou/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 500, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109932\"><a href=\"/opinion/109932/butz-v-economou/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, while the Stanley Court's clarification of Chappell occurred in the context of a Bivens action, Stanley can only be understood to apply equally to civil rights claims against state officials under section 1983 and, for that matter, under kindred statutes.  SeeWatson v. Arkansas Nat'l Guard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530004\"><a href=\"/opinion/530004/50-fair-emplpraccas-1718-51-empl-prac-dec-p-39332-john-c-watson-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1004</span></a></span>, 1007 (8th Cir.1989) (collecting cases construing Chappell rule to cover suits brought under section 1983).  The federal whistleblower statute, 5 U.S.C. Secs. 2301-2302, relied on by appellant in association with his civil rights claims, is a statute that falls comfortably within this generality.  Hence, the district court appropriately declined to clear the case for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Since a technician's dual roles are too tightly imbricated to be pried apart at a litigant's whim, appellant necessarily suffered the injury of which he complains in his military capacity.  See supra Part II.  For that reason, the injury arose incident to military service.  See supra Part III.  In these circumstances, Stanley applies, and, under the Stanley rule, the statements of claim contained in appellant's second amended complaint fail the test of justiciability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Regulation No. 15, promulgated by the Secretaries of the Army and Air Force pursuant to 32 U.S.C.
