Gen. L. ch. 21E from Blackstone Valley Electric Co.\r\n\n(\"BVE\") for the removal of ferric ferrocyanide (\"FFC\") from a\r\n\nwaste   site  in   North  Attleboro,   Massachusetts.     The\r\n\nCommonwealth's ability to recover its response costs, said to\r\n\nbe $5.8 million, turns largely on the question of whether FFC\r\n\nis a \"hazardous substance\" within the meaning of CERCLA.  The\r\n\nbroader concern raised by this case is identifying who should\r\n\ndecide  that  question and  by what  process.   We  hold that\r\n\nneither CERCLA  nor  the  existing  EPA  regulations  clearly\r\n\nestablish whether FFC is a  hazardous substance, and that the\r\n\ndistrict court erred in trying to resolve the question on the\r\n\nCommonwealth's motion  for summary  judgment, in the  face of\r\n\nwarring expert  affidavits, where  there is no  textual plain\r\n\nmeaning  to  resolve the  issue.   Invoking  the  doctrine of\r\n\nprimary  jurisdiction,  we  hold  that  the  EPA  should,  as\r\n\nCongress  intended,  address   the  question  in   the  first\r\n\ninstance.    Accordingly,  we  vacate the  grant  of  partial\r\n\nsummary judgment  and  order  referral  to  the  EPA  for  an\r\n\nadministrative  determination.   In  so doing  we reject  the\r\n\nEPA's argument as  amicus curiae  in this court  that it  has\r\n\neffectively answered the question of  whether FFC is a CERCLA\r\n\n\"hazardous substance\" by  adopting standard testing protocols\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nfor  effluent discharge  regulations  promulgated  under  the\r\n\nClean Water Act.\r\n\n                    I.  Factual Background\r                                                      \r\n\n        Like  many other  environmental cases,  the  story of\r\n\nthis  case   starts  in  the   last  century.     Before  the\r\n\nconstruction  of the  natural  gas pipeline  system, gas  for\r\n\nconsumer  use in  heating,  lighting, and  cooking was  often\r\n\nmanufactured from coal at localized facilities.  According to\r\n\none  1985 study commissioned by the EPA, there were some 1500\r\n\nsuch manufactured  gas plants  in  operation throughout  this\r\n\ncountry  between 1889  and 1950.   The  cleanup of  the waste\r\n\nbyproducts  of the  manufacturing process,  which often  were\r\n\nburied on site or  deposited in landfills, has been  a source\r\n\nof modern environmental litigation.  See, e.g., John Boyd Co.\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Boston Gas  Co., 1992  WL 212231,  *1 (D. Mass.  Aug. 18,\r                               \r\n\n1992),  aff'd,   992  F.2d  401,  403-04   (1st  Cir.  1993);\r                         \r\n\nInterstate  Power Co. v. Kansas  City Power &amp;  Light Co., 992\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 804, 805-06 (8th Cir. 1993).\r\n\n        An important  step in  the gas  manufacturing process\r\n\nwas  the purification of the gas obtained from the coal.  One\r\n\ntypical  purification method  involved pumping  the untreated\r\n\ngas through  \"purifier  boxes\" containing  wood chips  coated\r\n\nwith iron oxide.   As  the untreated gas  passed through  the\r\n\nboxes,  it reacted  chemically  with the  coated wood  chips,\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\ncausing  unwanted  substances  to   be  filtered  out.    The\r\n\nbyproducts of the purifying chemical reactions would build up\r\n\non the wood  chips.  One such byproduct was  a blue substance\r\n\ncalled  ferric ferrocyanide  (more commonly,  Prussian Blue).\r\n\nEventually,  the  spent  wood   chips     still  bearing  the\r\n\nbyproducts  of  the  chemical purification  process     would\r\n\ntypically be incinerated or buried.\r\n\n        In the early 1980's, blue-colored wood chips and soil\r\n\nwere discovered  in a  landfill near  a  residential area  in\r\n\nNorth Attleboro,  Massachusetts.   Between July 1984  and May\r\n\n1986,   the   Massachusetts   Department   of   Environmental\r\n\nProtection (\"DEP\") excavated the site to remove the blue soil\r\n\nand  wood chips.   The blue  substance on the  wood chips was\r\n\nidentified as  ferric ferrocyanide,  and the wood  chips were\r\n\nidentified as \"purifier box waste\" from the coal gasification\r\n\nprocess.  The DEP determined that the FFC-coated chips at the\r\n\nsite  had been transported there from a gas facility that had\r\n\nbeen operated by BVE's  direct corporate predecessor in Rhode\r\n\nIsland from  1920-1961.   The Commonwealth subsequently  sued\r\n\nBVE as a generator of  the FFC to recover its cleanup  costs,\r\n\npursuant  to  the  relevant  provisions  of  CERCLA  and  the\r\n\nanalogous Massachusetts state statutes.1\r\n\n                 II.  The Statutory Framework\r                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The only issue presented here is the CERCLA one.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nA.  The \"Hazardous Substance\" List\r                                              \r\n\n        CERCLA  provides  state   and  federal   governmental\r\n\nauthorities with  broad power  to clean  up waste  sites, and\r\n\nthen  to seek  recovery  of response  costs from  responsible\r\n\nparties.   42  U.S.C.      9604, 9607;  see generally  Dedham\r                                                                         \r\n\nWater Co. v.

One of the predicates to  CERCLA liability\r\n\nis  the  release  or   threatened  release  of  a  \"hazardous\r\n\nsubstance\" at the site.\r\n\n        A  \"hazardous substance\"  is  defined in  CERCLA,  42\r\n\nU.S.C.   9601(14),  by  incorporation  of  certain  lists  of\r\n\nsubstances, wastes, and pollutants  identified in a number of\r\n\nother environmental  statutes, including the Clean  Water Act\r\n\n(\"CWA\"),  33 U.S.C.    1251  et seq.2    CERCLA requires  the\r                                               \r\n\nAdministrator of the EPA to promulgate and revise regulations\r\n\ndesignating   as   additional   \"hazardous  substances\"   any\r\n\nsubstances  which, \"when  released  into the  environment may\r\n\npresent substantial danger to the public health or welfare or\r\n\nthe environment . . . .\"   42 U.S.C.   9602(a).

The parties agree that only the CWA\r                                    \r\nlist is pertinent here.\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nsubsuming all of the  statutory lists incorporated by CERCLA,\r\n\nat 40 C.F.R.   302.4, Table 302.4 (\"Table 302.4\").3\r\n\n        The substance FFC is not specifically named in any of\r\n\nthe statutory lists of  substances incorporated by CERCLA and\r\n\nhence  does not  appear in  Table 302.4.   The EPA  has never\r\n\ntaken  official action  pursuant  to its  authority under  42\r\n\nU.S.C.    9602(a)  specifically  to  add FFC  to  the  CERCLA\r\n\nhazardous substance list.  Table 302.4 does  list, however, a\r\n\nbroad category  of compounds    \"cyanides\"   which,  in turn,\r\n\nthe Commonwealth claims, does encompass FFC.\r                                         \r\n\nB.  \"Cyanides\"\r                         \r\n\n        The  category  \"cyanides\"  in  Table  302.4  has  its\r\n\norigins  in the  CWA.   The EPA  was required  to promulgate,\r\n\nwithin a short period  following the CWA's enactment,  a list\r\n\nof \"any toxic pollutant or combination of such pollutants\" to\r\n\nbe subject to regulation under the statute.  See CWA, Pub. L.\r                                                            \r\n\nNo. 92-500,   307(a)(1), 86 Stat. 816, 856, 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N.\r\n\n951, 1000.   Pursuant to this  directive, an ad  hoc EPA work\r                                                                \r\n\ngroup  developed  a proposed  list  of  65 toxic  pollutants.\r\n\nAfter  public notice and comment,  this list (the \"CWA list\")\r\n\nwas adopted  by Congress, see 33  U.S.C.   1317(a), published\r                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.

One of  the latter such  classes of\r\n\ncompounds on the  list is  \"cyanides.\"  The  dispute in  this\r\n\ncase has centered on  whether the term \"cyanides\" in  the CWA\r\n\nlist  (and  incorporated  into  Table  302.4)  includes  FFC,\r\n\nthereby bringing FFC within  the scope of CERCLA's definition\r\n\nof \"hazardous substance.\"\r\n\n           III.  Proceedings in the District Court\r                                                              \r\n\n        After discovery,  the Commonwealth moved  for partial\r\n\nsummary judgment as to  liability against BVE, claiming that,\r\n\nas a matter of law, FFC is a \"hazardous substance\" within the\r\n\nmeaning of CERCLA.  The Commonwealth argued FFC  falls within\r\n\nthe \"plain meaning\" of the term \"cyanides\" in Table 302.4.4\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  To avoid confusion, we observe that neither party\r\nattaches controlling significance to the fact that the common\r\nname of the substance at issue   ferric ferrocyanide  \r                \r\ncontains the word \"cyanide.\"  In fact, according to modern\r\nchemical nomenclature conventions, the proper name for FFC is\r\n\"iron(III) hexacyanoferrate(II).\"  The appearance of the word\r\n\"cyanide\" within the name \"ferric ferrocyanide\" does not\r\nfactor into the interpretation.\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\n        After  a  hearing on  the Commonwealth's  motion, the\r\n\ndistrict court  directed the  parties to \"focus  only on  the\r\n\nmeaning of the term  ['cyanides'] as it is understood  in the\r\n\ngeneral scientific community.\"  Commonwealth of Mass. v. BVE,\r                                                                        \r\n\nCiv.  No. 87-1799-T, Memorandum at 5 (D. Mass. May 23, 1990).\r\n\nAccordingly, BVE  filed expert affidavits attesting  that the\r\n\nplain meaning  of \"cyanides\"  does not include  the substance\r                                                  \r\n\nFFC, and the  Commonwealth filed expert affidavits  attesting\r\n\nthat it does.\r\n\n        Additionally, the Commonwealth  attempted to  solicit\r\n\nthe EPA's involvement in the case.  Before filing its motion,\r\n\nthe Commonwealth had asked the EPA to participate in the case\r\n\nas amicus curiae, but the EPA had refused.  After the summary\r\n\njudgment hearing,  the Commonwealth asked the  EPA to provide\r\n\nan  affidavit  stating  that  the  EPA's  own  definition  of\r\n\n\"cyanides\"  encompasses  FFC.   The  EPA  again declined  the\r\n\nCommonwealth's invitation.   Instead, the EPA  wrote a letter\r\n\nto the  Massachusetts Attorney  General's  office, signed  by\r\n\nStephen D.  Luftig, the Director of  EPA's Emergency Response\r\n\nDivision  (the \"Luftig  Letter\").   The  letter purported  to\r\n\ndescribe the EPA's  administrative view of the  status of FFC\r\n\nvis- -vis  the  CERCLA/CWA  category  of   \"cyanides.\"    The\r\n\nCommonwealth provided  this letter  to the district  court as\r\n\nadditional support for its motion.\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\n        The  district court granted the Commonwealth's motion\r\n\nfor  partial summary judgment.

It relied  instead upon two\r\n\nsentences of text concerning  chemical testing procedures for\r\n\ncyanides   contained  in   a  reference   publication  called\r\n\n\"Standard Methods.\"  See American Public Health Ass'n et al.,\r                                    \r\n\nStandard Methods for the  Examination of Water and Wastewater\r                                                                         \r\n\n(18th  ed.  1992).   One  of the  Commonwealth's  experts had\r\n\naverred that  Standard Methods  is  a \"'universally  accepted\r                                          \r\n\nenvironmental  chemistry lab  testing manual  in  the general\r\n\nscientific community.'\"   777 F. Supp.  at 1038 n.3  (quoting\r\n\nexpert   affidavit).     Based   on  its   reading  of   that\r\n\npublication,5  the  district  court  concluded that  FFC  was\r\n\nproperly classified as a \"complex cyanide,\" that \"[t]he plain\r\n\nmeaning  of  cyanides  includes  complexes  such  as   ferric\r\n\nferrocyanide,\"   and  that  FFC  was  therefore  a  hazardous\r\n\nsubstance within the meaning  of CERCLA.

The district court focused on the following paragraph:\r\n\n        Cyanide refers to all of the CN groups in cyanide\r\n        compounds that can be determined as the cyanide ion,\r\n        CN-, by the methods used.

Our review of the  district court's interpretation of\r\n\nthe  relevant statutory framework also is plenary.  See Estey\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

In assessing whether the  Commonwealth\r\n\nis entitled  to judgment as a  matter of law,  we must regard\r\n\nthe record and draw  all inferences in a manner  favorable to\r\n\nBVE.  Only if, viewed in that light, the record  discloses no\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Later, based in part on its grant of partial summary\r\njudgment against BVE on the FFC issue, the court entered\r\nsummary judgment in favor of the Commonwealth on the issue of\r\nBVE's liability as a generator under CERCLA, 42 U.S.C.\r\n  9607(a)(3).  See Commonwealth of Mass. v. Blackstone Valley\r                                                                         \r\nElectric Co., 808 F. Supp. 912, 914-16 (D. Mass. 1992).

Absence of Plain Meaning\r                                        \r\n\n        The Commonwealth and BVE  both argued to the district\r\n\ncourt that  the term  \"cyanides\" has a  \"plain meaning,\"  but\r\n\nwere sharply at  odds as to whether  that meaning encompasses\r\n\nFFC.  The district court endorsed the plain meaning approach,\r\n\nsee  777 F. Supp. at  1038, and agreed  with the Commonwealth\r               \r\n\nthat  the plain meaning of  \"cyanides\" includes FFC.   Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n1039.   We  find that  the district  court's reliance  on the\r\n\nplain meaning approach was misplaced on the facts here.\r\n\n        Of course when the words of a statutory provision are\r\n\nclear,  the  provision's   plain  meaning  must   govern  its\r\n\napplication, unless  a  palpably unreasonable  outcome  would\r\n\nresult.  See, e.g., Hogan v. Bangor &amp; Aroostook Railroad Co.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n61 F.3d 1034, 1037 (1st Cir. 1995); Pritzker v.

Yet, as the  qualifications that\r\n\nare a part of the plain  meaning rule suggest, that rule does\r\n\nnot  provide  a  panacea   for  every  problem  of  statutory\r\n\nconstruction.   Words can be ambiguous,  often materially so.\r\n\nSee Greenwood  Trust Co. v.  Commonwealth of Mass.,  971 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n818, 825  (1st Cir.  1992) (\"[T]he plain-meaning  doctrine is\r\n\nnot a pedagogical  absolute.\"), cert. denied, 113 S.

See, e.g., In re  Jarvis, 53\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 416, 419 (1st Cir. 1995) (finding plain meaning  inquiry\r\n\ninapposite where relevant language was indeterminate); United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.

The \"scientific  community\" is  not a\r\n\nmonolithic  entity   that  has   spoken  here  in   a  single\r\n\nauthoritative voice.  As one of BVE's experts stated, members\r\n\nof  different disciplines within  the scientific community at\r\n\nlarge are apt to  take sharply contrasting approaches  and to\r\n\ngive  conflicting answers  to  the question  whether FFC  can\r\n\nproperly be classified as  one of the \"cyanides.\"   Thus, the\r\n\nCommonwealth's  key expert,  an  analytical  chemist,  states\r\n\nconfidently  that  \"[t]here  can  be no  dispute  . . .  that\r\n\ncyanides and all other  chemical substances are defined based\r                                                                   \r\n\non   chemical  reactivity   [emphasis   added],\"   and   thus\r\n\nunderstands   \"cyanides\"  to  include   \"all  those  chemical\r\n\ncompounds containing the negatively charged cyanide ion, CN-\"\r\n\nand  that  \"can yield  the  free cyanide  ion\"  in laboratory\r                                                                         \r\n\nconditions.  Then, stating  that \"there is no doubt  that the\r\n\nCN moiety in iron cyanide complexes is uni-negative\" and that\r\n\nFFC  does  release  the  free  cyanide  ion  when  boiled  in\r\n\nconcentrated sulfuric acid, he concludes that FFC is properly\r\n\ncategorized as one  of the  \"cyanides.\"  On  the other  hand,\r\n\nBVE's expert (who  was one of the consultants to  the EPA who\r\n\n                             -15-\r\r\n\nhelped devise the CWA list) asserts  just as confidently that\r\n\nmost scientists other than analytical chemists  \"would define\r\n\n'cyanides' as substances that are toxic due to the CN group.\"\r\n\nStating  that   FFC  is  not  toxic  and   does  not  release\r\n\n\"toxicologically  significant doses  of [free]  cyanide under\r\n\nenvironmental  conditions  [emphasis  added],\"  BVE's  expert\r                         \r\n\nconcludes that FFC is  not properly classified as one  of the\r\n\n\"cyanides\" within the meaning of CERCLA.\r\n\n        The term  \"cyanides\" as it appears in Table 302.4 is,\r\n\nwe  believe, ambiguous in the context of this case.  The term\r\n\nsuffers from  an  ambiguity that  might  be classified  as  a\r\n\n\"categorical indeterminacy.\"  See Clark D.

The legislative history of\r\n\nthe statute contains no  express congressional guidance as to\r\n\nthe scope of  the term.   The regulatory  history of the  CWA\r\n\ntoxic  pollutant  list,  however,  does  provide  substantial\r\n\nreason for skepticism about  the Commonwealth's and the EPA's\r\n\nclaim that \"cyanides\" encompasses FFC.\r\n\n        The  list  of  substances and  classes  of substances\r\n\ncurrently codified  at 40  C.F.R.   401.15  (and incorporated\r\n\ninto  Table 302.4)  was  developed  by  the EPA  pursuant  to\r\n\nCongress' directive to produce a  list of toxic pollutants to\r\n\nbe subject to regulation under the  CWA. See CWA, Pub. L. No.\r                                                        \r\n\n92-500,    307(a)(1), 86  Stat.  816, 1972  U.S.C.C.A.N. 951,\r\n\n1000.

Reg. 24342\r\n\n(Sep.  7, 1973).  This original proposed list did not include\r\n\nthe category \"cyanides.\"  Instead, it listed \"cyanide and all\r\n\ncyanide  compounds.\"   38  Fed.  Reg.  at  24344.    The  EPA\r\n\ncommentary   accompanying  the   proposed  list   noted  that\r\n\n\"[c]yanide  is on  the  list because  of  its high  order  of\r\n\ntoxicity to aquatic life.\"   Id.

On  the final  CWA\r                                  \r\n\nlist  of  toxic  pollutants  (as adopted  by  Congress),  the\r\n\ncategory \"cyanide  and  all cyanide  compounds\" was  replaced\r\n\nwith the category \"cyanides.\"  See 40 C.F.R.   401.15.\r                                              \r\n\n        Viewed  in  the  light  most favorable  to  BVE,  the\r\n\nevidence indicates  that FFC  is highly stable,  insoluble in\r\n\nwater, and  completely non-toxic  to human and  aquatic life.\r\n\nAgainst  the  backdrop  of   (1)  the  definition  of  \"toxic\r\n\npollutant\"  contained  in  the  CWA;  (2)  the  congressional\r\n\ndirective that  required the  EPA to  \"take into account  the\r\n\ntoxicity\"  of pollutants in  producing the CWA  list; (3) the\r\n\nEPA's own comment that \"cyanide is on the list because of its\r\n\nhigh order of toxicity\";  and (4) the objections  that appear\r\n\nto have precipitated the change from \"cyanide and all cyanide\r\n\ncompounds\" to \"cyanides\", there would seem substantial reason\r\n\nto doubt that FFC, claimed to be a non-toxic substance, could\r\n\nproperly be  deemed to  fall within the  category \"cyanides.\"\r\n\nThe history of the CWA list tends to support BVE's claim that\r\n\n                             -19-\r\r\n\nthe category \"cyanides\"  was never contemplated to  encompass\r\n\nsubstances such as FFC for purposes of the CWA or CERCLA.\r\n\n        This  leaves  the question  of  whether  the EPA  has\r\n\nadopted  elsewhere an  official  agency  interpretation  that\r\n\nclearly  includes  or  excludes  FFC as  a  CERCLA  hazardous\r\n\nsubstance.   We find that  no such agency  interpretation has\r\n\nbeen established.\r\n\nC.  Absence of A Regulatory Definition\r                                                  \r\n\n        In its  amicus brief,  the EPA distances  itself from\r\n\nthe parties' and district court's \"law\" approach.   It argues\r\n\nthat  the  initial  decision  whether  FFC  is  a  \"hazardous\r\n\nsubstance\" is one that must be left to the EPA.  We agree.\r\n\n        It   further  argues,   however,  that   although  no\r\n\ndefinition  of \"cyanides\"  can  be found  in the  regulations\r\n\nidentifying CERCLA  hazardous substances,  it is spelled  out\r\n\nelsewhere in the applicable regulatory framework, and that it\r\n\nencompasses FFC.  On this score, we are not  persuaded, for a\r\n\nnumber  of reasons.    The regulatory  text  itself does  not\r\n\nsupport the argument; the argument leads to results which are\r\n\noverbroad and  defy common  sense; the  EPA has itself  taken\r\n\ninconsistent  positions; the  position is  articulated solely\r\n\nand  for the first time  in a litigation  posture; and policy\r\n\nreasons dictate against the approach proposed by the EPA.\r\n\n        1.  Absence of Rules Specifically Concerning FFC\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -20-\r\r\n\n        The  EPA  has  clearly  not  acted  pursuant  to  its\r\n\nauthority under  CERCLA, 42  U.S.C.   9602(a), nor  under the\r\n\nCWA,   33  U.S.C.     1317(a)(1),   to  promulgate   a   rule\r\n\nspecifically  listing FFC as a \"hazardous substance\" (CERCLA)\r\n\nor a \"toxic  pollutant\" (CWA).  Neither  the Commonwealth nor\r\n\namicus contends otherwise.   The EPA has also never  issued a\r\n\nrule specifically for  the purpose of  defining the scope  of\r\n\nthe term \"cyanides.\"  The EPA has in the past resorted to its\r\n\nrulemaking authority to provide  clear guidance to the public\r\n\nas to the scope  of at least six other  substances or classes\r                                                  \r\n\nof substances listed  as CWA toxic pollutants, see  40 C.F.R.\r                                                              \r\n\n  129.4, but  it never has  done so with respect  to the term\r\n\n\"cyanides.\"    Indeed, the  Luftig  Letter  submitted by  the\r\n\nCommonwealth to  the district court acknowledges  that \"[t]he\r\n\nterm 'cyanides' is not specifically defined in the CWA or, as\r\n\nfar as we can determine, in the legislative history . . . .\"\r\n\n        2.  The \"Total Cyanide\" Test\r                                                \r\n\n        The  EPA's central  focus in  its amicus brief  is on\r\n\ncertain regulations establishing a  testing protocol for  the\r\n\nanalysis  of cyanide  in effluent  discharges under  the CWA.\r\n\nThe EPA contends that this  test procedure provides the legal\r\n\ndefinition  of \"cyanides,\"  and  that FFC  falls within  this\r\n\ndefinition.    We  conclude   that  this  contention  is  not\r\n\nsupported by the relevant  regulatory framework, and that the\r\n\n                             -21-\r\r\n\ntesting protocol referred  to cannot properly be  interpreted\r\n\nto provide the definition of \"cyanides\" under CERCLA.\r\n\n        Independent of  its authority to  designate hazardous\r\n\nsubstances and toxic pollutants under CERCLA and the CWA, the\r\n\nEPA also  has authority and  responsibility under the  CWA to\r\n\n\"promulgate guidelines  establishing test procedures  for the\r\n\nanalysis of  pollutants that shall include  the factors which\r\n\nmust  be provided  in  any [CWA  compliance certification  or\r\n\npermit application].\"  33 U.S.C.   1314(h).  Pursuant to this\r\n\ndelegation, the EPA has issued regulations incorporating test\r\n\nprocedures for measuring the level of certain \"parameters\" in\r\n\na water or  waste sample.  See 40 C.F.R.   136.3.  One of the\r                                          \r\n\nlisted  parameters  is  \"cyanide-total,  mg/L.\"    Id.    The\r                                                                  \r\n\nregulation  indicates  that  the  procedures to  be  used  in\r\n\nmeasuring  \"cyanide-total\" in  effluent discharges  are those\r\n\ndescribed  in the  Standard  Methods  reference  publication.\r                                                \r\n\nAmicus  places  overriding  significance  upon  one  of these\r                                                               \r\n\nprocedures, called  the \"total  cyanide\" test.   See Standard\r                                                                         \r\n\nMethods,  supra,  at 4-20,  4-23.    This procedure  involves\r                           \r\n\nboiling  the sample  to  be tested  in concentrated  sulfuric\r\n\nacid.   Compounds that contain the CN group in their chemical\r\n\ncomposition, it  is said, will release  detectable amounts of\r\n\nfree cyanide when subjected to the procedure.\r\n\n        Amicus claims that, under the EPA's regulations,  any\r\n\nsubstance that releases cyanide upon being boiled in sulfuric\r\n\n                             -22-\r\r\n\nacid under the \"total  cyanide\" test qualifies as one  of the\r\n\n\"cyanides\"  for purposes  of  CERCLA liability.   It  further\r\n\nclaims that because FFC  releases some cyanide when subjected\r\n\nto the \"total  cyanide\" test,  it is necessarily  one of  the\r\n\n\"cyanides\" within the  meaning of  CERCLA.  We  do not  think\r\n\nthat this conclusion follows.\r\n\n        The  EPA's  own  regulations  do  not  use  the  test\r\n\nprocedures  identified  at 40  C.F.R.   136.3  (including the\r\n\nStandard  Methods protocol)  to define  the scope of  CWA- or\r                                                  \r\n\nCERCLA-designated categories of toxic pollutants or hazardous\r\n\nsubstances.   The regulations never state  that any substance\r\n\nthat  releases  cyanide  under   the  \"total  cyanide\"   test\r\n\nqualifies as one  of the \"cyanides\"  for purposes of  CERCLA.\r\n\nRather,  the  regulations  themselves  say   something  quite\r\n\ndifferent.    The regulation  that  specifically  governs the\r\n\napplicability  of the identified  test procedures states that\r\n\nthe  procedures are  intended  to \"perform  the measurements\"\r                                                                        \r\n\nrequired  in  connection  with  (a) Clean  Water  Act  permit\r\n\napplications,   (b)  discharge   reports,  and   (c)  certain\r\n\ncompliance  certifications  issued  by  states.    40  C.F.R.\r\n\n  136.1  (emphasis added).    None of  these three  expressly\r\n\ndesignated uses  for the test procedures  is applicable here,\r\n\nand  none has anything to  do with providing  a definition of\r                                                                      \r\n\nany  class of pollutants.  The  regulations intend the \"total\r\n\ncyanide\" procedure to serve only the purpose of measuring the\r\n\n                             -23-\r\r\n\ntotal  CN8 by weight in  the chemical composition  of a given\r\n\nwaste sample,  not to define which  chemical substances count\r\n\nas a  member of the category  \"cyanides.\"  Thus, even  if FFC\r\n\ncan  be measured  for \"total  cyanide\" composition  under the\r                            \r\n\nStandard Methods procedure,9  it surely does not  follow as a\r                            \r\n\nmatter of law or logic that  FFC is one of the \"cyanides\" for\r\n\npurposes of CERCLA liability.\r\n\n        A further difficulty  with amicus' attempt to  define\r\n\n\"cyanides\"  by reference  to the  total cyanide test  is that\r\n\nsuch  a definition may lead  to nonsensical results.   One of\r\n\nBVE's   experts  observes   that  there  are   many  everyday\r\n\nsubstances  that  contain  the  CN group  in  their  chemical\r\n\ncomposition (e.g.,  vitamin B-12, the synthetic  fiber Orlon,\r                             \r\n\nand a number of  common medicines such as Lomotil),  and some\r\n\nor  all of  these  substances, like  FFC, would  also release\r\n\ncyanide when subjected to the conditions of the total cyanide\r\n\ntest.10   Yet  no one,  including the  EPA, would  categorize\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  \"CN\" is the chemical formula of the cyanide molecule.\r\n\n9.  BVE's expert asserts that because of the properties of\r\nFFC, the total cyanide test cannot actually give an accurate\r                                                                        \r\nquantification of the total CN composition by weight in a\r\ngiven sample of FFC.  The Commonwealth's expert appears to\r\nagree on this point, but states that because FFC does\r\nnevertheless yield some cyanide when subjected to the\r                                   \r\nprocedure, FFC is one of the \"cyanides.\"\r\n\n10.  The Commonwealth's expert appears to deny that vitamin\r\nB-12 would release cyanide in a total cyanide test.  For\r\npurposes of deciding the Commonwealth's summary judgment\r\nmotion, we credit BVE's position on this factual issue, as we\r\nmust.  The EPA in its amicus brief does not attempt to\r\n\n                             -24-\r\r\n\nvitamin B-12, for  example, as one  of the \"cyanides\"  within\r\n\nthe meaning of the CWA or CERCLA.  BVE's experts have averred\r\n\nthat FFC's  chemical structure and composition  are much more\r\n\nsimilar  to  substances  like  vitamin  B-12  than  to  toxic\r\n\nsubstances like potassium cyanide.   Assuming BVE is correct,\r\n\nas  we must here, a  rule that defined  \"cyanides\" to include\r\n\nall substances that release any cyanide when subjected to the\r                                           \r\n\ntotal   cyanide   test   would   appear   to   be   untenably\r\n\noverinclusive.11\r\n\n        The unsettled  nature of the status  of FFC vis- -vis\r\n\nthe category  \"cyanides\" is further demonstrated  by at least\r\n\none documented  situation in  which the  EPA has  appeared to\r\n\ntake official action at odds with the position articulated in\r\n\nits amicus brief.   This situation, discussed  in some detail\r\n\nin  the  Luftig  Letter  submitted  to  the  district  court,\r\n\ninvolved the  EPA's handling  in 1985 of  ferrocyanide wastes\r\n\ngenerated at  a facility  operated by the  Mearl corporation.\r\n\nMearl  had filed  a petition  before the  EPA to  exclude its\r\n\nwastewater treatment sludge from  regulation under RCRA.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ndispute BVE's factual assertion.\r\n\n11.  Indeed, the problem of overbreadth is what appears to\r\nhave prompted commentators to object to the EPA's original\r\ninclusion of \"cyanide and all cyanide compounds\" on the\r\nproposed CWA list, and what prompted the change to\r\n\"cyanides.\"  See 38 Fed. Reg. at 24344.  Yet, using the\r                            \r\n\"total cyanide\" test to define \"cyanides\" as amicus proposes\r\nwould, in effect, make the category \"cyanides\" equivalent to\r\nthe rejected formulation, \"all cyanide compounds.\"\r\n\n                             -25-\r\r\n\n50 Fed. Reg. 7882, 7888-90 (Feb. 26, 1985).   Although a test\r\n\nfor total cyanide indicated positive results, Mearl argued to\r\n\nthe EPA that all cyanide in  the waste was \"in the insoluble,\r\n\nnon-toxic form  of ferric  ferrocyanide.\"   50  Fed. Reg.  at\r\n\n7889.   After  public hearing  and comment,  the EPA  granted\r\n\nMearl's petition  to exclude the waste  from RCRA regulation,\r\n\nstating  that  \"the   waste  does  not  exhibit  any  of  the\r\n\ncharacteristics  of hazardous  waste.\"   50 Fed.  Reg. 48886,\r\n\n48890  (Nov. 27,  1985).   The EPA  further stated  that \"the\r\n\ncyanide  present [in the sludge, in the form of FFC] will not\r\n\nconvert to  free cyanide  [in  environmental conditions]  and\r\n\ntherefore  is  not  of  regulatory concern  with  respect  to\r                                                      \r\n\nground-water or  atmospheric exposure routes.\"   50 Fed. Reg.\r\n\nat 48890 (emphasis added).\r\n\n        While  technically, the  decision to  exclude Mearl's\r\n\nwastewater sludge from RCRA regulation was limited to Mearl's\r\n\nown facility, and did  not directly affect the status  of FFC\r\n\nunder the CWA or CERCLA, it is difficult to ignore the  EPA's\r\n\nstatement  that the  FFC  in the  Mearl  sludge was  \"not  of\r\n\nregulatory  concern\" because  it  would not  convert to  free\r\n\ncyanide  under  environmental  conditions.   Here,  too,  the\r\n\nrecord supports  the conclusion  that  the FFC  found at  the\r\n\nAttleboro site may  pose no threat of  releasing free cyanide\r\n\n                             -26-\r\r\n\nunder normal  environmental conditions.12  At  a minimum, the\r\n\nEPA's action with respect to the Mearl petition provides some\r\n\nsupport for BVE's position in this litigation.\r\n\n        We conclude that the  EPA rules promulgated under the\r\n\nCWA  that identify  test  procedures for  the measurement  of\r\n\nwastewater parameters,  including the total cyanide  test, do\r\n\nnot set forth an agency definition of \"cyanides\" for purposes\r\n\nof the CWA's  list of  toxic pollutants or  CERCLA's list  of\r\n\nhazardous substances.  Thus,  even assuming that FFC releases\r\n\ncyanide  when  subjected to  the  Standard  Methods test  for\r                                                               \r\n\nmeasuring  \"total cyanide,\" it does not follow as a matter of\r\n\nlaw that FFC is one of the \"cyanides\" for  purposes of CERCLA\r\n\nliability.\r\n\n        3.  Agency Deference\r                                        \r\n\n        The  varying  positions stated  in  the  EPA's amicus\r\n\nbrief and in the Luftig Letter concerning the EPA's purported\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.  The Commonwealth's experts (and its counsel at oral\r\nargument) have suggested that FFC could degrade and release\r\ncyanide gas when exposed to sunlight.  BVE's expert has\r\nattested to a directly contrary conclusion.  Additionally,\r\nthe Commonwealth's counsel asserted at oral argument that\r\nsome free cyanide was found at the Attleboro site, suggesting\r                                 \r\nthat the cyanide had dissociated from the FFC under\r\nenvironmental conditions.  However, as far as the record\r\ndiscloses, only trace amounts of free cyanide were found at\r\nthe site, i.e., measuring less than 1 part per million.  By\r                          \r\ncomparison, the generally recognized safety threshold for\r\nfree cyanide in workroom air is 10 parts per million.  For\r\npurposes of evaluating the Commonwealth's summary judgment\r\nmotion, we must assume that FFC does not degrade when exposed\r\nto sunlight, and that no more than background levels of free\r\ncyanide were detectable at the Attleboro waste site.\r\n\n                             -27-\r\r\n\ndefinition of \"cyanides\" are  not entitled to deference under\r\n\nthe principles  of Chevron U.S.A., Inc.  v.

The Luftig Letter, while written by an EPA official,\r\ndoes not set forth an entrenched EPA view.  The letter does\r\nnot articulate a definition as such of the term \"cyanides\"\r\nand is tellingly circumspect in its discussion of the EPA's\r\npurported position on whether FFC falls within that category. \r\nInstead of stating outright that the EPA adheres to an\r\nestablished definition of \"cyanides\" that encompasses FFC, it\r\nmakes only the far weaker statement that \"the manner in which\r\nEPA addresses cyanides under the Clean Water Act indicates\r\nthat the term does include ferric ferrocyanide.\" \r\nFurthermore, while the letter says that the EPA uses the\r\ntotal cyanide test described in Standard Methods, it never\r                                                            \r\nstates that the EPA has defined \"cyanides\" by reference to\r                                           \r\nthat test, offering the more limited assertion that\r\n\"[t]he[se] testing procedures provide confirmation that\r                                                              \r\nferric ferrocyanide is a 'cyanide' [emphasis added].\"\r\n\n                             -28-\r\r\n\n        We  are also troubled by the EPA's approach here as a\r\n\nmatter  of  policy.   A  complicated  regulatory regime  like\r\n\nCERCLA or the CWA cannot function effectively unless citizens\r\n\nare  given  fair  notice  of  their  obligations.    Congress\r\n\ndelegated to  the EPA the  continuing task of  defining which\r\n\nsubstances  are   \"hazardous  substances\"  to   which  CERCLA\r\n\nliability can attach.   The EPA does not  argue here that the\r\n\nterm \"cyanides\"  has  a plain  meaning  that would  enable  a\r\n\nperson  to answer  the question  of whether FFC  falls within\r\n\nthat category.   Instead, it suggests  that the patchwork  of\r\n\nregulations  relating   to   the  measurement   of   effluent\r\n\ndischarges can be  adapted to the task at hand.   We can thus\r\n\ndetermine the  status of  FFC for CERCLA  liability purposes,\r\n\nsays the  EPA, by  boiling the  FFC in  concentrated sulfuric\r\n\nacid.  Yet the EPA points  to no regulation or other source  \r\n\nexcept its amicus submission  to this court   that  tells the\r\n\npublic that boiling a substance in concentrated sulfuric acid\r\n\nis the way to  determine whether it legally qualifies  as one\r\n\nof the \"cyanides.\"  That is not fair notice to the public and\r\n\nis not  what Congress  contemplated when it  granted the  EPA\r\n\npower  to promulgate  regulations  to  define and  supplement\r\n\nCERCLA's list of hazardous substances.\r\n\nD.  Primary Jurisdiction\r                                    \r\n\n        Because  there exists  no basis  for concluding  as a\r\n\nmatter  of law that  FFC falls within  the scope  of the term\r\n\n                             -29-\r\r\n\n\"cyanides,\"  the  district  court's  order  granting  partial\r\n\nsummary  judgment  in  favor  of  the  Commonwealth  must  be\r\n\nvacated.  We  are left,  then, to decide  whether the  proper\r\n\ndisposition  of  this appeal  is to  remand  the case  to the\r\n\ndistrict court for  trial, or to prescribe  some other avenue\r\n\nfor appropriate  factfinding with  respect to  \"cyanides\" and\r\n\nFFC.  We conclude that the proper course is a referral to the\r\n\nEPA under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.\r\n\n        Having  found that the  term \"cyanides\" is ambiguous,\r\n\nthat EPA's  regulatory framework does  not adequately  define\r\n\nthe  term, that the legislative and regulatory history of the\r\n\nterm  \"cyanides\"   does  not  establish   the  Commonwealth's\r\n\nposition, and that  the position advocated  by amicus is  not\r\n\nentitled  to  deference,  we   are  left  with  virtually  no\r\n\nlegislative  or  administrative   guidance  for   determining\r\n\nwhether,  on  the  record  before  us,  FFC  is  one  of  the\r\n\n\"cyanides.\"    Congress  delegated  to the  EPA,  not  to the\r\n\ncourts, the  authority to administer the  CWA toxic pollutant\r\n\nlist  and the CERCLA list of hazardous substances.  This case\r\n\nseems  clearly  to call  for referral  to  the EPA  under the\r\n\n\"primary   jurisdiction\"   doctrine,   for   an   appropriate\r\n\nadministrative determination of whether FFC  falls within the\r\n\ncategory  \"cyanides.\"  Cf.

Broadly  speaking,  the  doctrine, informed  by\r\n\nprinciples  of  deference  to  agency  decisionmaking,  gives\r\n\neffect  to  the  eminently  sensible notion  that  \"in  cases\r\n\nraising issues of fact not within the conventional experience\r\n\nof judges  or cases requiring the  exercise of administrative\r\n\ndiscretion, agencies created by  Congress for regulating  the\r\n\nsubject  matter should not be passed over.\"  Id.

Deaktor,\r                                                                        \r\n\n414 U.S. 113, 114-15 (1973)).  All three of these factors are\r\n\nplainly  satisfied here.  The determination  whether FFC is a\r\n\nhazardous substance  is specifically within the  scope of the\r\n\nEPA's delegated authority; the EPA's expertise is required to\r\n\nsift  through and properly weigh all of the arguments for and\r\n\nagainst  including FFC  within  the category  \"cyanides\"; and\r\n\nofficial  rulemaking   by  the   EPA  on  this   issue  would\r\n\nindisputably assist  the court in determining BVE's liability\r\n\nto the Commonwealth under CERCLA.14\r\n\n        The judicial machinery is  ill-suited to fashioning a\r\n\nworkable rule  for determining  whether the substance  FFC by\r\n\nvirtue of  its  chemical, structural,  functional,  or  other\r\n\nqualities, falls within the properly conceived definition  of\r\n\n\"cyanides.\"   That determination is  much better left  to the\r\n\nEPA.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.  We acknowledge the general principle that a primary\r\njurisdiction reference to an agency is usually inappropriate\r\nin an enforcement action brought by the agency.  See ICC v.\r                                                                    \r\nB&amp;T Transp. Co., 613 F.2d 1182, 1187 (1st Cir. 1980) (stating\r                           \r\nthat the primary jurisdiction doctrine does not apply where\r\nthe agency brings suit, because the agency's position on the\r\nmatter to be litigated will be clear).  This action, however,\r\nwas brought by the Commonwealth, not by the EPA.  As noted\r\nabove, the EPA's position on the definition of \"cyanides\" is\r\nfar from clear.\r\n\n                             -32-\r\r\n\n        Referral  to the  EPA under  the doctrine  of primary\r\n\njurisdiction  will  also  serve  the  interest   of  national\r\n\nuniformity in regulation.   The question of whether FFC  is a\r\n\nCERCLA hazardous substance is of more than local concern.  As\r\n\nnoted  earlier,  FFC  is  a   common  byproduct  of  the  gas\r\n\nmanufacturing process that was  prevalent in prior decades at\r\n\nsome 1500 different facilities across the country.  Moreover,\r\n\na  determination as to whether  FFC is one  of the \"cyanides\"\r\n\nwould undoubtedly have significant implications    beyond our\r\n\npurview    for similar  substances whose status  under CERCLA\r\n\ncurrently  remains unclear.  Rather than leave this matter to\r\n\nthe risk of inconsistent outcomes before particular courts in\r\n\ndifferent  parts of the country, we believe it better to have\r\n\nthe EPA resolve the issue nationwide.15\r\n\n        Accordingly,  we  conclude that  this case  should be\r\n\nreferred to  the EPA  for an administrative  determination of\r\n\nwhether FFC is one of the \"cyanides\" within the meaning of 40\r\n\nC.F.R.   401.15  and Table 302.4.   We further  conclude that\r\n\nthe district court proceedings  in this case shall  be stayed\r\n\nand that the  court shall retain jurisdiction over  this case\r\n\npending an  appropriate determination of the  relevant issues\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.

Gen. L. ch. 21E from Blackstone Valley Electric Co.\r\n\n(\"BVE\") for the removal of ferric ferrocyanide (\"FFC\") from a\r\n\nwaste   site  in   North  Attleboro,   Massachusetts.     The\r\n\nCommonwealth's ability to recover its response costs, said to\r\n\nbe $5.8 million, turns largely on the question of whether FFC\r\n\nis a \"hazardous substance\" within the meaning of CERCLA.  The\r\n\nbroader concern raised by this case is identifying who should\r\n\ndecide  that  question and  by what  process.   We  hold that\r\n\nneither CERCLA  nor  the  existing  EPA  regulations  clearly\r\n\nestablish whether FFC is a  hazardous substance, and that the\r\n\ndistrict court erred in trying to resolve the question on the\r\n\nCommonwealth's motion  for summary  judgment, in the  face of\r\n\nwarring expert  affidavits, where  there is no  textual plain\r\n\nmeaning  to  resolve the  issue.   Invoking  the  doctrine of\r\n\nprimary  jurisdiction,  we  hold  that  the  EPA  should,  as\r\n\nCongress  intended,  address   the  question  in   the  first\r\n\ninstance.    Accordingly,  we  vacate the  grant  of  partial\r\n\nsummary judgment  and  order  referral  to  the  EPA  for  an\r\n\nadministrative  determination.   In  so doing  we reject  the\r\n\nEPA's argument as  amicus curiae  in this court  that it  has\r\n\neffectively answered the question of  whether FFC is a CERCLA\r\n\n\"hazardous substance\" by  adopting standard testing protocols\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nfor  effluent discharge  regulations  promulgated  under  the\r\n\nClean Water Act.\r\n\n                    I.  Factual Background\r                                                      \r\n\n        Like  many other  environmental cases,  the  story of\r\n\nthis  case   starts  in  the   last  century.     Before  the\r\n\nconstruction  of the  natural  gas pipeline  system, gas  for\r\n\nconsumer  use in  heating,  lighting, and  cooking was  often\r\n\nmanufactured from coal at localized facilities.  According to\r\n\none  1985 study commissioned by the EPA, there were some 1500\r\n\nsuch manufactured  gas plants  in  operation throughout  this\r\n\ncountry  between 1889  and 1950.   The  cleanup of  the waste\r\n\nbyproducts  of the  manufacturing process,  which often  were\r\n\nburied on site or  deposited in landfills, has been  a source\r\n\nof modern environmental litigation.

One\r\n\ntypical  purification method  involved pumping  the untreated\r\n\ngas through  \"purifier  boxes\" containing  wood chips  coated\r\n\nwith iron oxide.   As  the untreated gas  passed through  the\r\n\nboxes,  it reacted  chemically  with the  coated wood  chips,\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\ncausing  unwanted  substances  to   be  filtered  out.    The\r\n\nbyproducts of the purifying chemical reactions would build up\r\n\non the wood  chips.  One such byproduct was  a blue substance\r\n\ncalled  ferric ferrocyanide  (more commonly,  Prussian Blue).\r\n\nEventually,  the  spent  wood   chips     still  bearing  the\r\n\nbyproducts  of  the  chemical purification  process     would\r\n\ntypically be incinerated or buried.\r\n\n        In the early 1980's, blue-colored wood chips and soil\r\n\nwere discovered  in a  landfill near  a  residential area  in\r\n\nNorth Attleboro,  Massachusetts.   Between July 1984  and May\r\n\n1986,   the   Massachusetts   Department   of   Environmental\r\n\nProtection (\"DEP\") excavated the site to remove the blue soil\r\n\nand  wood chips.   The blue  substance on the  wood chips was\r\n\nidentified as  ferric ferrocyanide,  and the wood  chips were\r\n\nidentified as \"purifier box waste\" from the coal gasification\r\n\nprocess.  The DEP determined that the FFC-coated chips at the\r\n\nsite  had been transported there from a gas facility that had\r\n\nbeen operated by BVE's  direct corporate predecessor in Rhode\r\n\nIsland from  1920-1961.   The Commonwealth subsequently  sued\r\n\nBVE as a generator of  the FFC to recover its cleanup  costs,\r\n\npursuant  to  the  relevant  provisions  of  CERCLA  and  the\r\n\nanalogous Massachusetts state statutes.1\r\n\n                 II.

One of the predicates to  CERCLA liability\r\n\nis  the  release  or   threatened  release  of  a  \"hazardous\r\n\nsubstance\" at the site.\r\n\n        A  \"hazardous substance\"  is  defined in  CERCLA,  42\r\n\nU.S.C.   9601(14),  by  incorporation  of  certain  lists  of\r\n\nsubstances, wastes, and pollutants  identified in a number of\r\n\nother environmental  statutes, including the Clean  Water Act\r\n\n(\"CWA\"),  33 U.S.C.    1251  et seq.2    CERCLA requires  the\r                                               \r\n\nAdministrator of the EPA to promulgate and revise regulations\r\n\ndesignating   as   additional   \"hazardous  substances\"   any\r\n\nsubstances  which, \"when  released  into the  environment may\r\n\npresent substantial danger to the public health or welfare or\r\n\nthe environment . . . .\"   42 U.S.C.   9602(a).

The parties agree that only the CWA\r                                    \r\nlist is pertinent here.\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nsubsuming all of the  statutory lists incorporated by CERCLA,\r\n\nat 40 C.F.R.   302.4, Table 302.4 (\"Table 302.4\").3\r\n\n        The substance FFC is not specifically named in any of\r\n\nthe statutory lists of  substances incorporated by CERCLA and\r\n\nhence  does not  appear in  Table 302.4.   The EPA  has never\r\n\ntaken  official action  pursuant  to its  authority under  42\r\n\nU.S.C.    9602(a)  specifically  to  add FFC  to  the  CERCLA\r\n\nhazardous substance list.  Table 302.4 does  list, however, a\r\n\nbroad category  of compounds    \"cyanides\"   which,  in turn,\r\n\nthe Commonwealth claims, does encompass FFC.\r                                         \r\n\nB.  \"Cyanides\"\r                         \r\n\n        The  category  \"cyanides\"  in  Table  302.4  has  its\r\n\norigins  in the  CWA.   The EPA  was required  to promulgate,\r\n\nwithin a short period  following the CWA's enactment,  a list\r\n\nof \"any toxic pollutant or combination of such pollutants\" to\r\n\nbe subject to regulation under the statute.  See CWA, Pub. L.\r                                                            \r\n\nNo. 92-500,   307(a)(1), 86 Stat. 816, 856, 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N.\r\n\n951, 1000.

One of  the latter such  classes of\r\n\ncompounds on the  list is  \"cyanides.\"  The  dispute in  this\r\n\ncase has centered on  whether the term \"cyanides\" in  the CWA\r\n\nlist  (and  incorporated  into  Table  302.4)  includes  FFC,\r\n\nthereby bringing FFC within  the scope of CERCLA's definition\r\n\nof \"hazardous substance.\"\r\n\n           III.  Proceedings in the District Court\r                                                              \r\n\n        After discovery,  the Commonwealth moved  for partial\r\n\nsummary judgment as to  liability against BVE, claiming that,\r\n\nas a matter of law, FFC is a \"hazardous substance\" within the\r\n\nmeaning of CERCLA.  The Commonwealth argued FFC  falls within\r\n\nthe \"plain meaning\" of the term \"cyanides\" in Table 302.4.4\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  To avoid confusion, we observe that neither party\r\nattaches controlling significance to the fact that the common\r\nname of the substance at issue   ferric ferrocyanide  \r                \r\ncontains the word \"cyanide.\"  In fact, according to modern\r\nchemical nomenclature conventions, the proper name for FFC is\r\n\"iron(III) hexacyanoferrate(II).\"  The appearance of the word\r\n\"cyanide\" within the name \"ferric ferrocyanide\" does not\r\nfactor into the interpretation.\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\n        After  a  hearing on  the Commonwealth's  motion, the\r\n\ndistrict court  directed the  parties to \"focus  only on  the\r\n\nmeaning of the term  ['cyanides'] as it is understood  in the\r\n\ngeneral scientific community.\"  Commonwealth of Mass. v. BVE,\r                                                                        \r\n\nCiv.  No. 87-1799-T, Memorandum at 5 (D. Mass. May 23, 1990).\r\n\nAccordingly, BVE  filed expert affidavits attesting  that the\r\n\nplain meaning  of \"cyanides\"  does not include  the substance\r                                                  \r\n\nFFC, and the  Commonwealth filed expert affidavits  attesting\r\n\nthat it does.\r\n\n        Additionally, the Commonwealth  attempted to  solicit\r\n\nthe EPA's involvement in the case.  Before filing its motion,\r\n\nthe Commonwealth had asked the EPA to participate in the case\r\n\nas amicus curiae, but the EPA had refused.  After the summary\r\n\njudgment hearing,  the Commonwealth asked the  EPA to provide\r\n\nan  affidavit  stating  that  the  EPA's  own  definition  of\r\n\n\"cyanides\"  encompasses  FFC.   The  EPA  again declined  the\r\n\nCommonwealth's invitation.   Instead, the EPA  wrote a letter\r\n\nto the  Massachusetts Attorney  General's  office, signed  by\r\n\nStephen D.  Luftig, the Director of  EPA's Emergency Response\r\n\nDivision  (the \"Luftig  Letter\").   The  letter purported  to\r\n\ndescribe the EPA's  administrative view of the  status of FFC\r\n\nvis- -vis  the  CERCLA/CWA  category  of   \"cyanides.\"    The\r\n\nCommonwealth provided  this letter  to the district  court as\r\n\nadditional support for its motion.\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\n        The  district court granted the Commonwealth's motion\r\n\nfor  partial summary judgment.

The \"scientific  community\" is  not a\r\n\nmonolithic  entity   that  has   spoken  here  in   a  single\r\n\nauthoritative voice.  As one of BVE's experts stated, members\r\n\nof  different disciplines within  the scientific community at\r\n\nlarge are apt to  take sharply contrasting approaches  and to\r\n\ngive  conflicting answers  to  the question  whether FFC  can\r\n\nproperly be classified as  one of the \"cyanides.\"   Thus, the\r\n\nCommonwealth's  key expert,  an  analytical  chemist,  states\r\n\nconfidently  that  \"[t]here  can  be no  dispute  . . .  that\r\n\ncyanides and all other  chemical substances are defined based\r                                                                   \r\n\non   chemical  reactivity   [emphasis   added],\"   and   thus\r\n\nunderstands   \"cyanides\"  to  include   \"all  those  chemical\r\n\ncompounds containing the negatively charged cyanide ion, CN-\"\r\n\nand  that  \"can yield  the  free cyanide  ion\"  in laboratory\r                                                                         \r\n\nconditions.  Then, stating  that \"there is no doubt  that the\r\n\nCN moiety in iron cyanide complexes is uni-negative\" and that\r\n\nFFC  does  release  the  free  cyanide  ion  when  boiled  in\r\n\nconcentrated sulfuric acid, he concludes that FFC is properly\r\n\ncategorized as one  of the  \"cyanides.\"  On  the other  hand,\r\n\nBVE's expert (who  was one of the consultants to  the EPA who\r\n\n                             -15-\r\r\n\nhelped devise the CWA list) asserts  just as confidently that\r\n\nmost scientists other than analytical chemists  \"would define\r\n\n'cyanides' as substances that are toxic due to the CN group.\"\r\n\nStating  that   FFC  is  not  toxic  and   does  not  release\r\n\n\"toxicologically  significant doses  of [free]  cyanide under\r\n\nenvironmental  conditions  [emphasis  added],\"  BVE's  expert\r                         \r\n\nconcludes that FFC is  not properly classified as one  of the\r\n\n\"cyanides\" within the meaning of CERCLA.\r\n\n        The term  \"cyanides\" as it appears in Table 302.4 is,\r\n\nwe  believe, ambiguous in the context of this case.

The  EPA\r\n\ncommentary   accompanying  the   proposed  list   noted  that\r\n\n\"[c]yanide  is on  the  list because  of  its high  order  of\r\n\ntoxicity to aquatic life.\"   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  The text </span><pre class=\"inline\"> then acknowledged\r                                            \r\n\nthat  some commentators  had \"objected  to inclusion  of 'all\r\n\ncyanide compounds'\" and had \"argued that only compounds which\r\n\ndissociate in  water to form toxic  concentrations of cyanide\r\n\nion  or hydrogen  cyanide should  be included.\"   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>   Thus,\r                                                                 \r\n\n                             -18-\r</span><pre class=\"inline\">\r\n\nthere  was  some  public concern  that  the  listing of  \"all\r\n\ncyanide compounds\" was overinclusive,  and that only a subset\r\n\nof \"cyanide  compounds\"   compounds  which, in  environmental\r\n\nconditions would  produce toxic results    should be included\r\n\non  the CWA  list.

We find that  no such agency  interpretation has\r\n\nbeen established.\r\n\nC.  Absence of A Regulatory Definition\r                                                  \r\n\n        In its  amicus brief,  the EPA distances  itself from\r\n\nthe parties' and district court's \"law\" approach.   It argues\r\n\nthat  the  initial  decision  whether  FFC  is  a  \"hazardous\r\n\nsubstance\" is one that must be left to the EPA.  We agree.\r\n\n        It   further  argues,   however,  that   although  no\r\n\ndefinition  of \"cyanides\"  can  be found  in the  regulations\r\n\nidentifying CERCLA  hazardous substances,  it is spelled  out\r\n\nelsewhere in the applicable regulatory framework, and that it\r\n\nencompasses FFC.  On this score, we are not  persuaded, for a\r\n\nnumber  of reasons.    The regulatory  text  itself does  not\r\n\nsupport the argument; the argument leads to results which are\r\n\noverbroad and  defy common  sense; the  EPA has itself  taken\r\n\ninconsistent  positions; the  position is  articulated solely\r\n\nand  for the first time  in a litigation  posture; and policy\r\n\nreasons dictate against the approach proposed by the EPA.\r\n\n        1.  Absence of Rules Specifically Concerning FFC\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -20-\r\r\n\n        The  EPA  has  clearly  not  acted  pursuant  to  its\r\n\nauthority under  CERCLA, 42  U.S.C.   9602(a), nor  under the\r\n\nCWA,   33  U.S.C.     1317(a)(1),   to  promulgate   a   rule\r\n\nspecifically  listing FFC as a \"hazardous substance\" (CERCLA)\r\n\nor a \"toxic  pollutant\" (CWA).  Neither  the Commonwealth nor\r\n\namicus contends otherwise.   The EPA has also never  issued a\r\n\nrule specifically for  the purpose of  defining the scope  of\r\n\nthe term \"cyanides.\"  The EPA has in the past resorted to its\r\n\nrulemaking authority to provide  clear guidance to the public\r\n\nas to the scope  of at least six other  substances or classes\r                                                  \r\n\nof substances listed  as CWA toxic pollutants, see  40 C.F.R.\r                                                              \r\n\n  129.4, but  it never has  done so with respect  to the term\r\n\n\"cyanides.\"    Indeed, the  Luftig  Letter  submitted by  the\r\n\nCommonwealth to  the district court acknowledges  that \"[t]he\r\n\nterm 'cyanides' is not specifically defined in the CWA or, as\r\n\nfar as we can determine, in the legislative history . . . .\"\r\n\n        2.  The \"Total Cyanide\" Test\r                                                \r\n\n        The  EPA's central  focus in  its amicus brief  is on\r\n\ncertain regulations establishing a  testing protocol for  the\r\n\nanalysis  of cyanide  in effluent  discharges under  the CWA.\r\n\nThe EPA contends that this  test procedure provides the legal\r\n\ndefinition  of \"cyanides,\"  and  that FFC  falls within  this\r\n\ndefinition.    We  conclude   that  this  contention  is  not\r\n\nsupported by the relevant  regulatory framework, and that the\r\n\n                             -21-\r\r\n\ntesting protocol referred  to cannot properly be  interpreted\r\n\nto provide the definition of \"cyanides\" under CERCLA.\r\n\n        Independent of  its authority to  designate hazardous\r\n\nsubstances and toxic pollutants under CERCLA and the CWA, the\r\n\nEPA also  has authority and  responsibility under the  CWA to\r\n\n\"promulgate guidelines  establishing test procedures  for the\r\n\nanalysis of  pollutants that shall include  the factors which\r\n\nmust  be provided  in  any [CWA  compliance certification  or\r\n\npermit application].\"  33 U.S.C.   1314(h).  Pursuant to this\r\n\ndelegation, the EPA has issued regulations incorporating test\r\n\nprocedures for measuring the level of certain \"parameters\" in\r\n\na water or  waste sample.  See 40 C.F.R.   136.3.  One of the\r                                          \r\n\nlisted  parameters  is  \"cyanide-total,  mg/L.\"    </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>    The\r                                                                  \r\n\nregulation </span><pre class=\"inline\"> indicates  that  the  procedures to  be  used  in\r\n\nmeasuring  \"cyanide-total\" in  effluent discharges  are those\r\n\ndescribed  in the  Standard  Methods  reference  publication.\r                                                \r\n\nAmicus  places  overriding  significance  upon  one  of these\r                                                               \r\n\nprocedures, called  the \"total  cyanide\" test.   See Standard\r                                                                         \r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Methods,</span>  supra,  at <span class=\"page\">4</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">-20,  4-23.    This procedure  involves\r                           \r\n\nboiling  the sample  to  be tested  in concentrated  sulfuric\r\n\nacid.   Compounds that contain the CN group in their chemical\r\n\ncomposition, it  is said, will release  detectable amounts of\r\n\nfree cyanide when subjected to the procedure.\r\n\n        Amicus claims that, under the EPA's regulations,  any\r\n\nsubstance that releases cyanide upon being boiled in sulfuric\r\n\n                             -22-\r\r\n\nacid under the \"total  cyanide\" test qualifies as one  of the\r\n\n\"cyanides\"  for purposes  of  CERCLA liability.   It  further\r\n\nclaims that because FFC  releases some cyanide when subjected\r\n\nto the \"total  cyanide\" test,  it is necessarily  one of  the\r\n\n\"cyanides\" within the  meaning of  CERCLA.  We  do not  think\r\n\nthat this conclusion follows.\r\n\n        The  EPA's  own  regulations  do  not  use  the  test\r\n\nprocedures  identified  at 40  C.F.R.   136.3  (including the\r\n\nStandard  Methods protocol)  to define  the scope of  CWA- or\r                                                  \r\n\nCERCLA-designated categories of toxic pollutants or hazardous\r\n\nsubstances.   The regulations never state  that any substance\r\n\nthat  releases  cyanide  under   the  \"total  cyanide\"   test\r\n\nqualifies as one  of the \"cyanides\"  for purposes of  CERCLA.\r\n\nRather,  the  regulations  themselves  say   something  quite\r\n\ndifferent.    The regulation  that  specifically  governs the\r\n\napplicability  of the identified  test procedures states that\r\n\nthe  procedures are  intended  to \"perform  the measurements\"\r                                                                        \r\n\nrequired  in  connection  with  (a) Clean  Water  Act  permit\r\n\napplications,   (b)  discharge   reports,  and   (c)  certain\r\n\ncompliance  certifications  issued  by  states.    40  C.F.R.\r\n\n  136.1  (emphasis added).    None of  these three  expressly\r\n\ndesignated uses  for the test procedures  is applicable here,\r\n\nand  none has anything to  do with providing  a definition of\r                                                                      \r\n\nany  class of pollutants.  The  regulations intend the \"total\r\n\ncyanide\" procedure to serve only the purpose of measuring the\r\n\n                             -23-\r\r\n\ntotal  CN8 by weight in  the chemical composition  of a given\r\n\nwaste sample,  not to define which  chemical substances count\r\n\nas a  member of the category  \"cyanides.\"  Thus, even  if FFC\r\n\ncan  be measured  for \"total  cyanide\" composition  under the\r                            \r\n\nStandard Methods procedure,9  it surely does not  follow as a\r                            \r\n\nmatter of law or logic that  FFC is one of the \"cyanides\" for\r\n\npurposes of CERCLA liability.\r\n\n        A further difficulty  with amicus' attempt to  define\r\n\n\"cyanides\"  by reference  to the  total cyanide test  is that\r\n\nsuch  a definition may lead  to nonsensical results.   One of\r\n\nBVE's   experts  observes   that  there  are   many  everyday\r\n\nsubstances  that  contain  the  CN group  in  their  chemical\r\n\ncomposition (e.g.,  vitamin B-12, the synthetic  fiber Orlon,\r                             \r\n\nand a number of  common medicines such as Lomotil),  and some\r\n\nor  all of  these  substances, like  FFC, would  also release\r\n\ncyanide when subjected to the conditions of the total cyanide\r\n\ntest.10   Yet  no one,  including the  EPA, would  categorize\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  \"CN\" is the chemical formula of the cyanide molecule.\r\n\n9.  BVE's expert asserts that because of the properties of\r\nFFC, the total cyanide test cannot actually give an accurate\r                                                                        \r\nquantification of the total CN composition by weight in a\r\ngiven sample of FFC.  The Commonwealth's expert appears to\r\nagree on this point, but states that because FFC does\r\nnevertheless yield some cyanide when subjected to the\r                                   \r\nprocedure, FFC is one of the \"cyanides.\"\r\n\n10.  The Commonwealth's expert appears to deny that vitamin\r\nB-12 would release cyanide in a total cyanide test.  For\r\npurposes of deciding the Commonwealth's summary judgment\r\nmotion, we credit BVE's position on this factual issue, as we\r\nmust.  The EPA in its amicus brief does not attempt to\r\n\n                             -24-\r\r\n\nvitamin B-12, for  example, as one  of the \"cyanides\"  within\r\n\nthe meaning of the CWA or CERCLA.  BVE's experts have averred\r\n\nthat FFC's  chemical structure and composition  are much more\r\n\nsimilar  to  substances  like  vitamin  B-12  than  to  toxic\r\n\nsubstances like potassium cyanide.   Assuming BVE is correct,\r\n\nas  we must here, a  rule that defined  \"cyanides\" to include\r\n\nall substances that release any cyanide when subjected to the\r                                           \r\n\ntotal   cyanide   test   would   appear   to   be   untenably\r\n\noverinclusive.11\r\n\n        The unsettled  nature of the status  of FFC vis- -vis\r\n\nthe category  \"cyanides\" is further demonstrated  by at least\r\n\none documented  situation in  which the  EPA has  appeared to\r\n\ntake official action at odds with the position articulated in\r\n\nits amicus brief.   This situation, discussed  in some detail\r\n\nin  the  Luftig  Letter  submitted  to  the  district  court,\r\n\ninvolved the  EPA's handling  in 1985 of  ferrocyanide wastes\r\n\ngenerated at  a facility  operated by the  Mearl corporation.\r\n\nMearl  had filed  a petition  before the  EPA to  exclude its\r\n\nwastewater treatment sludge from  regulation under RCRA.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ndispute BVE's factual assertion.\r\n\n11.  Indeed, the problem of overbreadth is what appears to\r\nhave prompted commentators to object to the EPA's original\r\ninclusion of \"cyanide and all cyanide compounds\" on the\r\nproposed CWA list, and what prompted the change to\r\n\"cyanides.\"  See 38 Fed. Reg. at 24344.  Yet, using the\r                            \r\n\"total cyanide\" test to define \"cyanides\" as amicus proposes\r\nwould, in effect, make the category \"cyanides\" equivalent to\r\nthe rejected formulation, \"all cyanide compounds.\"\r\n\n                             -25-\r\r\n\n50 Fed. Reg. 7882, 7888-90 (Feb. 26, 1985).   Although a test\r\n\nfor total cyanide indicated positive results, Mearl argued to\r\n\nthe EPA that all cyanide in  the waste was \"in the insoluble,\r\n\nnon-toxic form  of ferric  ferrocyanide.\"   50  Fed. Reg.  at\r\n\n7889.   After  public hearing  and comment,  the EPA  granted\r\n\nMearl's petition  to exclude the waste  from RCRA regulation,\r\n\nstating  that  \"the   waste  does  not  exhibit  any  of  the\r\n\ncharacteristics  of hazardous  waste.\"   50 Fed.  Reg. 48886,\r\n\n48890  (Nov. 27,  1985).   The EPA  further stated  that \"the\r\n\ncyanide  present [in the sludge, in the form of FFC] will not\r\n\nconvert to  free cyanide  [in  environmental conditions]  and\r\n\ntherefore  is  not  of  regulatory concern  with  respect  to\r                                                      \r\n\nground-water or  atmospheric exposure routes.\"   50 Fed. Reg.\r\n\nat 48890 (emphasis added).\r\n\n        While  technically, the  decision to  exclude Mearl's\r\n\nwastewater sludge from RCRA regulation was limited to Mearl's\r\n\nown facility, and did  not directly affect the status  of FFC\r\n\nunder the CWA or CERCLA, it is difficult to ignore the  EPA's\r\n\nstatement  that the  FFC  in the  Mearl  sludge was  \"not  of\r\n\nregulatory  concern\" because  it  would not  convert to  free\r\n\ncyanide  under  environmental  conditions.   Here,  too,  the\r\n\nrecord supports  the conclusion  that  the FFC  found at  the\r\n\nAttleboro site may  pose no threat of  releasing free cyanide\r\n\n                             -26-\r\r\n\nunder normal  environmental conditions.12  At  a minimum, the\r\n\nEPA's action with respect to the Mearl petition provides some\r\n\nsupport for BVE's position in this litigation.\r\n\n        We conclude that the  EPA rules promulgated under the\r\n\nCWA  that identify  test  procedures for  the measurement  of\r\n\nwastewater parameters,  including the total cyanide  test, do\r\n\nnot set forth an agency definition of \"cyanides\" for purposes\r\n\nof the CWA's  list of  toxic pollutants or  CERCLA's list  of\r\n\nhazardous substances.  Thus,  even assuming that FFC releases\r\n\ncyanide  when  subjected to  the  Standard  Methods test  for\r                                                               \r\n\nmeasuring  \"total cyanide,\" it does not follow as a matter of\r\n\nlaw that FFC is one of the \"cyanides\" for  purposes of CERCLA\r\n\nliability.\r\n\n        3.  Agency Deference\r                                        \r\n\n        The  varying  positions stated  in  the  EPA's amicus\r\n\nbrief and in the Luftig Letter concerning the EPA's purported\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.  The Commonwealth's experts (and its counsel at oral\r\nargument) have suggested that FFC could degrade and release\r\ncyanide gas when exposed to sunlight.  BVE's expert has\r\nattested to a directly contrary conclusion.  Additionally,\r\nthe Commonwealth's counsel asserted at oral argument that\r\nsome free cyanide was found at the Attleboro site, suggesting\r                                 \r\nthat the cyanide had dissociated from the FFC under\r\nenvironmental conditions.  However, as far as the record\r\ndiscloses, only trace amounts of free cyanide were found at\r\nthe site, i.e., measuring less than 1 part per million.  By\r                          \r\ncomparison, the generally recognized safety threshold for\r\nfree cyanide in workroom air is 10 parts per million.  For\r\npurposes of evaluating the Commonwealth's summary judgment\r\nmotion, we must assume that FFC does not degrade when exposed\r\nto sunlight, and that no more than background levels of free\r\ncyanide were detectable at the Attleboro waste site.\r\n\n                             -27-\r\r\n\ndefinition of \"cyanides\" are  not entitled to deference under\r\n\nthe principles  of Chevron U.S.A., Inc.  v.

The Luftig Letter, while written by an EPA official,\r\ndoes not set forth an entrenched EPA view.  The letter does\r\nnot articulate a definition as such of the term \"cyanides\"\r\nand is tellingly circumspect in its discussion of the EPA's\r\npurported position on whether FFC falls within that category. \r\nInstead of stating outright that the EPA adheres to an\r\nestablished definition of \"cyanides\" that encompasses FFC, it\r\nmakes only the far weaker statement that \"the manner in which\r\nEPA addresses cyanides under the Clean Water Act indicates\r\nthat the term does include ferric ferrocyanide.\" \r\nFurthermore, while the letter says that the EPA uses the\r\ntotal cyanide test described in Standard Methods, it never\r                                                            \r\nstates that the EPA has defined \"cyanides\" by reference to\r                                           \r\nthat test, offering the more limited assertion that\r\n\"[t]he[se] testing procedures provide confirmation that\r                                                              \r\nferric ferrocyanide is a 'cyanide' [emphasis added].\"\r\n\n                             -28-\r\r\n\n        We  are also troubled by the EPA's approach here as a\r\n\nmatter  of  policy.   A  complicated  regulatory regime  like\r\n\nCERCLA or the CWA cannot function effectively unless citizens\r\n\nare  given  fair  notice  of  their  obligations.    Congress\r\n\ndelegated to  the EPA the  continuing task of  defining which\r\n\nsubstances  are   \"hazardous  substances\"  to   which  CERCLA\r\n\nliability can attach.   The EPA does not  argue here that the\r\n\nterm \"cyanides\"  has  a plain  meaning  that would  enable  a\r\n\nperson  to answer  the question  of whether FFC  falls within\r\n\nthat category.   Instead, it suggests  that the patchwork  of\r\n\nregulations  relating   to   the  measurement   of   effluent\r\n\ndischarges can be  adapted to the task at hand.   We can thus\r\n\ndetermine the  status of  FFC for CERCLA  liability purposes,\r\n\nsays the  EPA, by  boiling the  FFC in  concentrated sulfuric\r\n\nacid.  Yet the EPA points  to no regulation or other source  \r\n\nexcept its amicus submission  to this court   that  tells the\r\n\npublic that boiling a substance in concentrated sulfuric acid\r\n\nis the way to  determine whether it legally qualifies  as one\r\n\nof the \"cyanides.\"  That is not fair notice to the public and\r\n\nis not  what Congress  contemplated when it  granted the  EPA\r\n\npower  to promulgate  regulations  to  define and  supplement\r\n\nCERCLA's list of hazardous substances.\r\n\nD.  Primary Jurisdiction\r                                    \r\n\n        Because  there exists  no basis  for concluding  as a\r\n\nmatter  of law that  FFC falls within  the scope  of the term\r\n\n                             -29-\r\r\n\n\"cyanides,\"  the  district  court's  order  granting  partial\r\n\nsummary  judgment  in  favor  of  the  Commonwealth  must  be\r\n\nvacated.  We  are left,  then, to decide  whether the  proper\r\n\ndisposition  of  this appeal  is to  remand  the case  to the\r\n\ndistrict court for  trial, or to prescribe  some other avenue\r\n\nfor appropriate  factfinding with  respect to  \"cyanides\" and\r\n\nFFC.  We conclude that the proper course is a referral to the\r\n\nEPA under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.\r\n\n        Having  found that the  term \"cyanides\" is ambiguous,\r\n\nthat EPA's  regulatory framework does  not adequately  define\r\n\nthe  term, that the legislative and regulatory history of the\r\n\nterm  \"cyanides\"   does  not  establish   the  Commonwealth's\r\n\nposition, and that  the position advocated  by amicus is  not\r\n\nentitled  to  deference,  we   are  left  with  virtually  no\r\n\nlegislative  or  administrative   guidance  for   determining\r\n\nwhether,  on  the  record  before  us,  FFC  is  one  of  the\r\n\n\"cyanides.\"    Congress  delegated  to the  EPA,  not  to the\r\n\ncourts, the  authority to administer the  CWA toxic pollutant\r\n\nlist  and the CERCLA list of hazardous substances.  This case\r\n\nseems  clearly  to call  for referral  to  the EPA  under the\r\n\n\"primary   jurisdiction\"   doctrine,   for   an   appropriate\r\n\nadministrative determination of whether FFC  falls within the\r\n\ncategory  \"cyanides.\"  Cf.

All three of these factors are\r\n\nplainly  satisfied here.  The determination  whether FFC is a\r\n\nhazardous substance  is specifically within the  scope of the\r\n\nEPA's delegated authority; the EPA's expertise is required to\r\n\nsift  through and properly weigh all of the arguments for and\r\n\nagainst  including FFC  within  the category  \"cyanides\"; and\r\n\nofficial  rulemaking   by  the   EPA  on  this   issue  would\r\n\nindisputably assist  the court in determining BVE's liability\r\n\nto the Commonwealth under CERCLA.14\r\n\n        The judicial machinery is  ill-suited to fashioning a\r\n\nworkable rule  for determining  whether the substance  FFC by\r\n\nvirtue of  its  chemical, structural,  functional,  or  other\r\n\nqualities, falls within the properly conceived definition  of\r\n\n\"cyanides.\"   That determination is  much better left  to the\r\n\nEPA.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.

This action, however,\r\nwas brought by the Commonwealth, not by the EPA.

The question of whether FFC  is a\r\n\nCERCLA hazardous substance is of more than local concern.  As\r\n\nnoted  earlier,  FFC  is  a   common  byproduct  of  the  gas\r\n\nmanufacturing process that was  prevalent in prior decades at\r\n\nsome 1500 different facilities across the country.

Rather than leave this matter to\r\n\nthe risk of inconsistent outcomes before particular courts in\r\n\ndifferent  parts of the country, we believe it better to have\r\n\nthe EPA resolve the issue nationwide.15\r\n\n        Accordingly,  we  conclude that  this case  should be\r\n\nreferred to  the EPA  for an administrative  determination of\r\n\nwhether FFC is one of the \"cyanides\" within the meaning of 40\r\n\nC.F.R.   401.15  and Table 302.4.
