We  have carefully reviewed the  record and\r                           \r\n\naffirm the  district court's dismissal of  appellant's   2255\r\n\npetition without an evidentiary hearing.\r\n\n     1.  Counsel's failure  to subpoena Tina Pina's telephone\r\n\nrecords was  a permissible  strategic decision which  did not\r\n\nconstitute ineffective assistance of  counsel.  That Tina had\r\n\nleft  in   place  a  block  preventing   her  from  receiving\r\n\nappellant's calls would have undercut counsel's spurned woman\r\n\nstrategy and would not have been particularly probative since\r\n\nthe jury might instead have concluded  that the apology calls\r\n\noccurred  at a  later  time and  that  Tina had  simply  been\r\n\nmistaken about the date. \r\n\n     2.    Any  error  in  introducing  the  nature  of   the\r\n\nunderlying felony  conviction was harmless in  view of Stefan\r\n\nPina's testimony concerning  defendant's access  to guns  and\r\n\nmotive to possess one.  \r\n\n     3.  For the reasons stated in the district court's March\r\n\n30,  1995 and  May 23,  1995 opinions, appellant's  claims of\r\n\nprosecutorial misconduct do not warrant habeas relief.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n",
