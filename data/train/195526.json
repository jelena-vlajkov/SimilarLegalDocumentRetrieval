Glickstein, Attorneys Tax Division, Department of Justice on\n                \nbrief for appellees.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n     Per Curiam.   Appellant taxpayer James  P. Hobbs appeals\n               \n\nthe dismissal  by the  United States District  Court for  the\n\nDistrict  of  Massachusetts  of  his  complaint  against  the\n\nInternal   Revenue  Service  for  damages  and/or  injunctive\n\nrelief.  We affirm the  dismissal essentially for the reasons\n\ngiven by the district court in its memorandum and order dated\n\nNovember 30, 1993.  We add only the following comments.\n\n     Hobbs' claims are predicated  on his allegation that the\n\ndetermination that he owed tax deficiencies for the tax years\n\n1985 and 1986 was  improper.  However, the United  States Tax\n\nCourt   has  already  dismissed  Hobbs'  challenge  to  those\n\ndeficiencies and  this court  has dismissed Hobbs'  appeal of\n\nthat decision  for failure  to prosecute.   Hobbs, therefore,\n\ncan  no longer  challenge the  merit of  that determination.1\n\nSee Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 598 (1948) (general\n                          \n\nrules of res  judicata apply to tax proceedings involving the\n                      \n\nsame claim and the same tax year).\n\n     Hobbs' contention  that  the  district  court  erred  in\n\ndetermining that  the deficiencies had been properly assessed\n\nis  also without merit.   According to  Hobbs, the assessment\n\n                    \n\n1.  We   give   no   credit  to   Hobbs'   wholly  conclusory\nallegations, unsupported  by  any facts,  that these  rulings\nwere obtained by  the use  of fraudulent filings  in the  Tax\nCourt.   See Correa-Martinez v.  Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d\n                                                   \n49,  52 (1st  Cir.  1990) (even  though  complaint is  to  be\nconstrued  liberally,  it cannot  rest  wholly on  conclusory\nallegations).  \n\nwas void because the government failed to provide him with an\n\nadequate and timely notice of deficiency.  \n\n     An assessment is made \"by recording the liability of the\n\ntaxpayer in the office of the Secretary.\"  26 U.S.C.    6203.\n\nThis is accomplished by having an assessment officer fill out\n\nand  sign a \"summary record  of assessment,\" also  known as a\n\nForm  23C.  Geiselman  v. United States,  961 F.2d 1,  5 (1st\n                                       \n\nCir.), cert. denied, 113 S.Ct. 261 (1992).  In this case, the\n                   \n\ngovernment did not provide the district court with a Form 23C\n\nbut with a Certificate of Assessment and Payments (Form 4340)\n\nwhich listed the Form 23C date.  \n\n     A  Certificate   of  Assessment  and  Payments  is  both\n\n\"presumptive proof of a valid assessment,\" id. at 6  (quoting\n                                             \n\nUnited  States  v. Chila,  871  F.2d  1015, 1018  (11th  Cir.\n                        \n\n1989)), and  \"presumptive proof that  the IRS gave  notice of\n\nthe assessments  and made  demands of payment  from [Hobbs],\"\n\nid.   Hobbs bears the burden of producing evidence to counter\n  \n\nthese presumptions.   See,  e.g., United States  v. McCallum,\n                                                            \n\n970 F.2d 66, 71 (5th Cir. 1992) (citing cases).\n\n     Hobbs contends  that the  Certificate of  Assessment and\n\nPayments is invalid  because it  is dated May  4, 1993,  well\n\nbeyond  the  date the  limitation  period expired.2    For an\n\nassessment to be valid,  it must be made, in  accordance with\n\n                    \n\n2.  The assessment  must be made  within three  years of  the\nfiling of the return  which gives rise to the  liability that\nis the subject of the assessment.  26 U.S.C.   6501(a).\n\n                             -3-\n\nall rules and regulations of the  Department of the Treasury,\n\nbefore the expiration  of the limitation period.   See, e.g.,\n                                                           \n\nBrafman  v. United States, 384 F.2d 863, 865 (5th Cir. 1967).\n                         \n\n     Hobbs'  contention is  meritless.   Treasury regulations\n\nprovide  that \"[t]he date of  the assessment is  the date the\n\nsummary record is  signed.\"  26 C.F.R.   301.6203-1 (emphasis\n              \n\nadded).   As indicated  above, the Certificate of  Assessment\n\nand  Payments  on  which Hobbs  relies  is  not  the \"summary\n\nrecord\"  referred   to  in  the  regulation.     Rather,  the\n\ncertificate is a supporting document identifying the taxpayer\n\nand explaining the character of  the assessment.  Stallard v.\n                                                          \n\nUnited States, 12 F.3d 489, 493 (5th Cir. 1994).  Not only is\n             \n\nthere no requirement that  the certificate be prepared within\n\nthe statute of limitation period, id., but the Certificate of\n                                    \n\nAssessment and Payments  indicates that the  Form 23C was  in\n\nfact dated within the limitation period.3\n\n     Since  Hobbs  made  no  showing  to  the  contrary,  the\n\ndistrict court did not  err in relying on the  Certificate of\n\nAssessment and Payments as proof that Hobbs had been properly\n\nassessed  and had been given  proper notice and  demand.  See\n                                                             \n\nGeiselman, 961 F.2d at 6.  \n         \n\n                    \n\n3.  The Form 4030  listed the Form 23C date as  June 1, 1987.\nAbsent evidence to the  contrary, this is sufficient evidence\nthat the Form  23C was duly signed on that  date.  See United\n                                                             \nStates  v. Dixon, 672  F.Supp. 503. 505-06  (M.D. Ala. 1987),\n                \naff'd, 849 F.2d 1478 (11th Cir. 1988).\n     \n\n                             -4-\n\n     Affirmed. \n             \n\n                             -5-\n",

See, e.g.,  Brafman v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"277619\"><a href=\"/opinion/277619/carolyn-brafman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">863</span></a></span>, 865 (5th Cir. 1967).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hobbs' contention is meritless.  Treasury regulations provide that \"[t]he date of the assessment is the date the summary record is signed.\"  26 C.F.R. Sec. 301.6203-1 (emphasis added).  As indicated above, the Certificate of Assessment and Payments on which Hobbs relies is not the \"summary record\" referred to in the regulation.  Rather, the certificate is a supporting document identifying the taxpayer and explaining the character of the assessment.   Stallard v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6209\"><a href=\"/opinion/6209/stallard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span>, 493 (5th Cir. 1994).  Not only is there no requirement that the certificate be prepared within the statute of limitation period, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6209\"><a href=\"/opinion/6209/stallard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> but the </a></span>Certificate of Assessment and Payments indicates that the Form 23C was in fact dated within the limitation period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Hobbs made no showing to the contrary, the district court did not err in relying on the Certificate of Assessment and Payments as proof that Hobbs had been properly assessed and had been given proper notice and demand.
