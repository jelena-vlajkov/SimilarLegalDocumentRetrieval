We affirm.\n\n     The  option of a seller  to retain a  buyer's deposit as\n\nliquidated damages  is the  common practice  in Massachusetts\n\nconveyancing.  Lynch v.  Andrew, 20 Mass. App. Ct.  623, 627,\r                                           \n\n481  N.E.2d 1383,  1386, review  denied, 396 Mass.  1102, 484\r                                                   \n\nN.E.2d 102 (1985).   Massachusetts courts \"are disinclined to\n\ntamper  with  [such]  a  well  established  solution  to  the\n\nproblems of expense and uncertainty in litigating the precise\n\ndamages  in cases of this kind.\"   Id.  This is especially so\r                                                 \n\nwhen, as  here, nothing  suggests that the  liquidated damage\n\nprovision was  negotiated other than at  arm's length between\n\nsophisticated parties.  See id.\r                                          \n\n     Two  points   must  be  considered   in  assessing   the\n\nenforceability of a liquidated damages clause.  \"Where actual\n\ndamages are difficult to  ascertain and where the  sum agreed\n\nupon by  the  parties at  the time  of the  execution of  the\n\ncontract  represents  a  reasonable estimate  of  the  actual\n\ndamages, such  a contract will be  enforced. . . .  But where\n\nthe   actual  damages  are   easily  ascertainable   and  the\n\nstipulated sum  is unreasonably and  grossly disproportionate\n\nto the  real  damages  from a  breach,  or  is  unconsciously\r\r\n\nexcessive, the court will  award the aggrieved party  no more\n\nthan his  actual damages.\"   Shapiro v.  Grinspoon, 27  Mass.\r                                                              \n\nApp.  Ct. 596, 603, 541  N.E.2d 359, 365  (1989) (quoting A-Z\r                                                                         \n\nServicenter,  Inc. v.

Moreover,\n\nnothing  in the  record  indicates  that  BHMC  ever  had  an\n\nopportunity  after Mulligan's  breach  to sell  the  property\n\nuntil it was compelled to do  so at auction three years later\n\nand  at  a much  lower price.    Such circumstances  make the\n\nseller's   actual  damages   \"difficult  to   calculate  with\n\nprecision,\"  Lynch,  20 Mass. App. Ct. at 682,  481 N.E.2d at\r                              \n\n1386 (finding damages difficult  to ascertain in part because\n\n\"house was not sold within days of the first buyer's default,\n\nat about the same  price, and without complicating factors\"),\n\nand  \"[w]hen losses  are difficult to  quantify, considerable\n\ndeference is due to  the parties' reasonable agreement  as to\n\nliquidated damages,\"  Id (citing cases).  Since Mulligan does\r                                    \n\nnot  claim   that  the  liquidated  damages   clause  was  an\n\nunreasonable estimate of damages at the time the contract was\n\nexecuted, we find no error  in the bankruptcy court's finding\n\nthe liquidated damages clause enforceable in this case.\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n     In addition,  essentially for  the reasons given  by the\n\ndistrict court  in its  memorandum and order  dated July  19,\n\n1994, we find Mulligan's other claims to be without merit.\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
