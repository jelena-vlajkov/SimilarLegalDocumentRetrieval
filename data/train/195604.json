GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge.\r                                                        \r\n\nportion of our opinion disposes of those issues which do not have\r\n\nsufficient precedential value to warrant publication.  Therefore,\r\n\nwe incorporate by reference  the statement of the case  and facts\r\n\nfrom the published portion of  our opinion of the same date.   We\r\n\nhere discuss and  affirm the  rulings of the  district court  in:\r\n\n(1) denying James Murray's  suppression motion; (2) denying Jaime\r\n\nCatano's motion for severance;  (3) denying Jaime Catano's motion\r\n\nto participate  in Michael  Murray's omnibus motion  hearing; (4)\r\n\nmanaging the use of peremptory challenges; (5) refusing to define\r\n\nreasonable  doubt;  (6)  convicting  Jaime  Catano of  continuing\r\n\ncriminal enterprise; and (7)  refusing to adjust Michael Murray's\r\n\nsentence for acceptance of responsibility or to depart downward.\r\n\n              I.  JAMES MURRAY'S SUPPRESSION MOTION\r                        I.  JAMES MURRAY'S SUPPRESSION MOTION\r                                                             \r\n\n          James Murray  argues that  the district court  erred in\r\n\ndenying  his  motion  to   suppress  evidence  police  seized  in\r\n\nwarrantless searches of  James Murray's pickup truck and  a Buick\r\n\nJames Murray had rented.   When the agents arrested  James Murray\r\n\non November 6, 1991, they seized keys to the rented  Buick and to\r\n\nthe pickup truck.  The  Buick was parked at the hotel  where they\r\n\nhad arrested  James Murray.  The  pickup was in a  parking lot of\r\n\nthe  Dallas-Ft.  Worth airport.    The agents  had  both vehicles\r\n\nsearched.  In  the Buick, they found a  rental agreement in James\r\n\nMurray's name,  $2,350 in  cash, a  Smith  Corona typewriter  and\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\ntwelve telephone books from the Southeastern United States.1   In\r\n\nthe  pickup, they found $100,000 cash behind  the seat.  After an\r\n\nevidentiary  hearing,  the district  court denied  James Murray's\r\n\nmotion to suppress  the evidence  seized from the  Buick and  the\r\n\npickup.\r\n\n          James  Murray  argues   that  the  government   had  to\r\n\nestablish  both  probable  cause  and  exigent  circumstances  to\r\n\njustify  the warrantless search of these vehicles, but in this he\r\n\nis  mistaken.   Under  the  automobile  exception to  the  search\r\n\nwarrant requirement, if a  motor vehicle is in transit  or parked\r\n\nin  a public  place,  police may  search  it without  a  warrant,\r\n\nrelying  solely on probable cause.   United States  v. McCoy, 977\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 706, 710 (1st  Cir. 1992); United States v. Panitz, 907 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n1267, 1271-72 (1st Cir. 1990).\r\n\n          James Murray  argues that  there was not  even probable\r\n\ncause, because the agents'  suspicions were based on the  word of\r\n\nRoberto L pez, whom the agents knew to be unreliable.\r\n\n          The  agents had  \"probable cause\"  for the  searches if\r\n\nthey  had facts  to support a  \"well-founded conclusion  'that an\r\n\noffense has been committed and . . . sound reason to believe that\r\n\na particular search will turn up  evidence of it.'\"  Panitz,  907\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d at 1271 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  We\r\n\nreview  a  district  court's  finding  of  probable  cause  on  a\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   The typewriter  and telephone books are  relevant in light of\r\nMichael  Murray's comments  in  a video  taped conversation  with\r\nother  conspirators that  he would  make bills  of lading  with a\r\ntypewriter. \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nsuppression  motion for clear error.  United States v. Zapata, 18\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          Contrary to James Murray's contention, the government's\r\n\nprobable cause does not depend on the word of L pez, but on taped\r\n\nconversations  among the  conspirators  and observations  of  the\r\n\nconspirators' actions  after the  conversations.  From  the audio\r\n\ntape supplied by  Nigro, the government  knew Michael Murray  was\r\n\nexpecting  to   obtain  marijuana   from  \"Mexicans,\"   that  the\r\n\nconspirators  were going to Texas for that purpose, and that they\r\n\nwould  have  money to  finance  the  purchase and  transportation\r\n\ncosts.   Shortly  before  Leonel Catano  and  L pez left  in  the\r\n\ntractor-trailer for  Texas, the DEA  overheard their conversation\r\n\nwith  the Murrays,  in  which they  coordinated their  respective\r\n\nduties for the upcoming trip.\r\n\n          By the time they  searched James Murray's vehicles, the\r\n\nDEA agents  had seen the conspirators  take a number of  steps in\r\n\naccordance  with  the   plans  laid  out  in  this   video  taped\r\n\nconversation.   In  the  tape,  the group  agreed  to go  to  the\r\n\n\"crane,\" and  they later went to  a crane yard, where  they put a\r\n\nsteel tank on their trailer.  (There was evidence that  the group\r\n\nhad used that tank before to  transport marijuana.)  In the  tape\r\n\nMichael Murray said that he would get  money and Leonel should go\r\n\nto a truck stop; later that day, aerial surveillance agents saw a\r\n\nparked  sedan (such  as  Michael  Murray  was  driving)  next  to\r\n\nLeonel's truck in the truck area of a highway rest stop.  The car\r\n\nand truck left the rest stop at the same time.  In the video tape\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nMichael Murray said that James Murray would \"go and he's going to\r\n\nhave  money to pay the other transportation people up in Dallas;\"\r\n\nthree days later, James Murray  showed up in McAllen, Texas in  a\r\n\ncar  rented at  the  Dallas-Fort Worth  airport.   In  the  taped\r\n\nconversation  Michael  Murray  had  instructed  L pez  and Leonel\r\n\nCatano  to \"go  to  Dallas, drop  the  box  then just  come,  ah,\r\n\nbobtail.\"  Leonel Catano and  L pez did in fact drop  the trailer\r\n\noff in Luling and \"bobtail\" to McAllen.\r\n\n          From the  taped conversation and subsequent  actions of\r\n\nthe  parties to  that conversation,  the government  had probable\r\n\ncause to believe  that James Murray was  involved in a scheme  to\r\n\nbuy marijuana in south Texas and transport it north, and that  he\r\n\nwould be carrying a  significant amount of money  to pay for  the\r\n\ntransportation  costs.  His rental car and his truck were logical\r\n\nplaces  to look for the money.  The district court did not err in\r\n\nfinding probable cause,  or in denying  James Murray's motion  to\r\n\nsuppress.\r\n\n             II.  JAIME CATANO'S MOTION FOR SEVERANCE\r                       II.  JAIME CATANO'S MOTION FOR SEVERANCE\r                                                               \r\n\n          Jaime Catano  argues that  the district court  erred in\r\n\ndenying  his  motion  to  sever.   Jaime  Catano's  argument  for\r\n\nseverance is lumped together  with his argument for participation\r\n\nin Michael Murray's omnibus hearing and reads, in its entirety:\r\n\n            [I]t was error for  the District Court to\r\n            deny  Jaime  Catano's  Motion  to  Sever.\r\n            Michael Murray had cooperated extensively\r\n            with the  government.   There was no  way\r\n            Jaime Catano's counsel  could know  that,\r\n            in  a  joint  trial, the  source  of  the\r\n            government's evidence against him was co-\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n            defendant  Michael Murray.  See Bruton v.\r                                                               \r\n            U.S., 391 U.S. 123 (1968).\r                          \r\n\n          Denial of a motion  for severance is \"committed  to the\r\n\nsound discretion of  the trial court,  and we review  only for  a\r\n\nmanifest  abuse  of  discretion  resulting in  a  miscarriage  of\r\n\njustice.\"  United States  v. Welch, 15 F.3d 1202, 1210  (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1993),  cert.  denied,  114  S.  Ct.  1661  (1994).    To  obtain\r                               \r\n\nseverance,  a defendant must  show that  \"'substantial prejudice'\r\n\nwould result  from  a  joint trial.\"    Id.  (citation  omitted).\r                                                     \r\n\nPrejudice in  this  context requires  \"more  than just  a  better\r\n\nchance  of  acquittal at  a separate  trial.\"   United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMart nez, 479  F.2d 824, 828  (1st Cir. 1973).   Jaime Catano has\r                  \r\n\nshown  no substantial prejudice.  Further, his reliance on Bruton\r                                                                           \r\n\nis misplaced.  Bruton prevents the  admission at a joint trial of\r                               \r\n\none co-defendant's extrajudicial  statements implicating  another\r\n\nabsent the opportunity for cross-examination, 391 U.S. at 135-36,\r\n\na situation  not presented  here.  Jaime  Catano's three-sentence\r\n\nargument  leaves the  issue undeveloped  and,  therefore, waived.\r\n\nSee United States v.  Zannino, 895 F.2d 1,  17 (1st Cir.),  cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied, 494 U.S. 1082 (1990).\r                \r\n\n            III.  JAIME CATANO'S MOTION TO PARTICIPATE\r                      III.  JAIME CATANO'S MOTION TO PARTICIPATE\r                                                                \r\n\n          Jaime Catano sought to participate in  Michael Murray's\r\n\nomnibus hearing  described in  Part I  of our  published opinion.\r\n\nJaime  Catano contended  that Michael  Murray's bargain  with the\r\n\ngovernment  would benefit Jaime Catano  as well.   He argues that\r\n\nhis  participation  would  have   allowed  him  to  cross-examine\r\n\nwitnesses as to the benefit which  he would receive from his  own\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nand from Michael  Murray's cooperation with  the government.   He\r\n\nfurther  argues that  he  could have  \"threshed out\"  discussions\r\n\nbetween himself  and the DEA  and \"gleaned\"  any information  the\r\n\ngovernment  learned about him from Michael Murray.  At the motion\r\n\nhearing,  Jaime  Catano's  counsel  orally  moved  the  court  to\r\n\nintervene and  examine witnesses.  The district judge ruled, \"I'm\r\n\nnot going  to let you examine, but on the  other hand, you file a\r\n\nmotion supported  by an affidavit  and I'll  deal with it.\"   The\r\n\njudge also stated that Jaime Catano had no standing to intervene.\r\n\nLater,  Jaime Catano's  counsel again orally  moved the  court to\r\n\nparticipate in the hearing.  Again the  judge stated, \"I told you\r\n\nto make a motion.  I told you to support your motion.  You  get a\r\n\nmotion.  I'll rule on it. . . . But two days have gone by, I have\r\n\nno  motion, the matter is between Mr. Murray and the government.\"\r\n\nAfter  the hearing  concluded and  the trial began,  Jaime Catano\r\n\nserved  a \"Motion for Relief\"  on the government  with a two-page\r\n\nunsigned  affidavit attached  which  purported to  be from  Jaime\r\n\nCatano.  The motion  asked that the charges against  Jaime Catano\r\n\nbe dismissed or, in the alternative, \"that the agreement with the\r\n\ngovernment   between  Catano,   Michael  Murray  and   the  other\r\n\ndefendants be enforced.\"  Jaime Catano's \"affidavit\" alleged that\r\n\na  DEA special  agent contacted  him and  urged him  to cooperate\r\n\n\"which would  result in a sentence for me of less than five years\r\n\nsince Michael Murray would  get no more than  five years for  his\r\n\nsentence.\"    The  affidavit  also  alleged  that  \"when  Michael\r\n\n[Murray] told me that the government wasn't going to give him the\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nzero  to five year deal after he  set up the fentanyl lab, I told\r\n\n[the special agent] that he was going to have to give Michael and\r\n\nthe  rest of  us our deal  if he  wanted me  to cooperate.\"   The\r\n\naffidavit  conspicuously  fails  to  allege  that   Jaime  Catano\r\n\nactually cooperated  or  detrimentally relied  in any  way.   The\r\n\ngovernment  disputes that  this  motion and  affidavit were  ever\r\n\nfiled in  the district court.   On appeal, Jaime  Catano does not\r\n\nargue  that the district court wrongfully denied the motion, only\r\n\nthat the  district court  wrongfully denied him  participation in\r\n\nMichael Murray's hearing.\r\n\n          This argument fails for two  reasons:  (1) as discussed\r\n\nabove, Jaime Catano did not timely move the court in writing  for\r\n\nparticipation in Michael Murray's hearing as the court requested;\r\n\nand (2) Jaime Catano had no standing to intervene as he had shown\r\n\nneither an agreement  intended to  benefit him directly  or as  a\r\n\nthird-party  beneficiary,2 nor  any  cooperation  or  detrimental\r\n\nreliance on  his part.  See United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325,\r                                                            \r\n\n1332  (1st Cir. 1994) (holding  that a criminal  defendant is not\r\n\nentitled  to an  evidentiary hearing  unless he  \"allege[s] facts\r\n\nthat, if proven, would entitle him to relief\").  In  short, \"[t]o\r\n\nmandate an  evidentiary hearing, the challenger's  attack must be\r\n\nmore than conclusory  and must be supported  by more than a  mere\r\n\ndesire  to cross-examine.\"  Franks v.

LEONEL CATANO'S OBJECTION TO THE PROCEDURE\r                                                                  \r\n                    FOR PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES\r                              FOR PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES\r                                                       \r\n\n          Leonel Catano  argues that the district  court erred in\r\n\nits  management of  peremptory challenges  by reconstituting  the\r\n\nvenire  after  Catano   had  already  exercised  his   peremptory\r\n\nchallenges,  without permitting Catano a chance  to strike any of\r\n\nthe new veniremen.\r\n\n          The court used a \"jury  box\" system of jury  selection.\r\n\nSee  generally  8A  James  Wm. Moore,  Moore's  Federal  Practice\r                        \r\n\n  24.05[1]  (2d ed. Feb. 1995 rev.).   First, the court asked the\r\n\nentire  venire  questions to  determine  whether  there were  any\r\n\nreasons that particular  jurors could not be  impartial.  Several\r\n\njurors were excused at this point, so that the venire dwindled to\r\n\ntwenty-seven  people.    The  court announced  it  would  impanel\r\n\nfourteen  people--enough for  twelve jurors and  two alternates--\r\n\nthen permit each side  to make peremptory challenges.   The court\r\n\nwould refill the box with new veniremen to replace the challenged\r\n\nveniremen until  both sides  had used  their  challenges or  were\r\n\nsatisfied  with  the  panel.   The  government  would have  seven\r\n\nperemptory challenges and  the defendants eleven.  Fed.  R. Crim.\r\n\nP. 24(b)  and (c).   The last two  jurors to  remain unchallenged\r\n\nwould be  the alternates.  The government  exercised four strikes\r\n\non the first  panel, then  the defendants exercised  seven.   The\r\n\ncourt filled the eleven seats left vacant by the strikes with new\r\n\nveniremen  for round two.   The defense challenged  four of these\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\neleven,  and  the government  challenged  two.   Thus,  after two\r\n\nrounds  a  total  of eight  jurors  had  been  selected, and  the\r\n\ndefendants had used up all their challenges.\r\n\n          At this point there were not enough remaining veniremen\r\n\nto  refill the  jury  box.    Therefore,  the  court  called  the\r\n\nremaining two  veniremen into the  box, and the  government chose\r\n\nnot to  challenge them.  Of  necessity, the court  called for new\r\n\nveniremen  to be  brought  in  from the  jury  pool.   Since  the\r\n\ndefendants were  out of peremptory challenges  and the government\r\n\ndeclined to  exercise its remaining challenge, all  four of these\r\n\nnew veniremen  were impaneled.  However,  the defendants objected\r\n\nto one  of  these jurors,  arguing  that they  had  no chance  to\r\n\nchallenge  him.  The court replied that the defendants had simply\r\n\nused  up their  allotted number  of strikes,  and that  the court\r\n\nwould not allow them extra challenges.\r\n\n          After the jury  had been  selected, there  was a  delay\r\n\nbefore trial  while  the court  conducted  motion hearings.    It\r\n\nhappened that during this hiatus  the court had to excuse  two of\r\n\nthe  jurors.  It decided  to impanel four  new alternates, making\r\n\nthe two previous alternates deliberating  jurors.  The court gave\r\n\neach side two peremptory challenges to use on  this supplementary\r\n\njury selection.\r\n\n          Leonel  Catano  argues  that  the  court's  system  was\r\n\nunfair, apparently because he had no opportunity to strike any of\r\n\nthe  veniremen in the third  round of the  regular jury selection\r\n\nand these included new veniremen not in the original venire.  His\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nargument  is  unfounded.    The district  court  has  substantial\r\n\ndiscretion to  regulate the  use of peremptory  challenges within\r\n\nthe framework of Federal  Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(b).   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited  States v. Cox, 752 F.2d 741,  748 (1st Cir. 1985).  After\r                               \r\n\nthe initial  voir dire and before  the court filled the  jury box\r\n\nfor the  first round,  the venire  had  dwindled to  twenty-seven\r\n\npeople.   The court announced  at the outset  that the government\r\n\nand   defendants   together   would   have   eighteen  peremptory\r\n\nchallenges.    Twelve  jurors  and two  alternates  were  needed.\r\n\nSimple arithmetic made it  apparent at the outset that  the court\r\n\nmight have to  call more veniremen  to get  enough for the  jury.\r\n\nThe defendants used up their peremptories on the original venire,\r\n\nwithout knowing who might  walk in the door next.  Having created\r\n\ntheir own predicament, they have no cause to complain.\r\n\n          Though  his argument  is  unclear,  Leonel Catano  also\r\n\nappears  to object to the court's procedure when events after the\r\n\ninitial jury selection made it necessary to select more alternate\r\n\njurors.  The  court announced  it would give  the defendants  two\r\n\nadditional challenges  because of this new  development, but that\r\n\nthe challenges could only be used on newly impanelled jurors, not\r\n\nthose already seated.  Leonel Catano argues that the court should\r\n\nhave permitted the  use of the new  challenges to strike the  old\r\n\njurors, two of whom were initially designated  alternates but now\r\n\nwould  be deliberating jurors.  The court did not anticipate that\r\n\nit would be necessary to  supplement the jury when the panel  was\r\n\ninitially  chosen.  When  unexpected events made  it necessary to\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nimpanel new alternates, there was no reason the court should have\r\n\nto open up the  existing panel to new challenges.  This  is not a\r\n\ncase  like United States  v. Sams,  470 F.2d  751, 755  (5th Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1972), in  which the  defendant was  surprised by an  unannounced\r\n\nrule that prevented him  from striking the first group  of jurors\r\n\nin later  rounds.   Here, the  defendants  understood the  system\r\n\ninitially employed.  If  the court had not  impanelled additional\r\n\nalternates  (which  was  undoubtedly   in  its  discretion),  the\r\n\nremaining twelve jurors would  have deliberated and Leonel Catano\r\n\nwould have no  argument.   Catano's complaint arises  out of  the\r\n\nfact that the court impanelled more alternates out of caution and\r\n\nCatano  wants to benefit from this chance occurrence by using the\r\n\nnew  challenges  on   the  old  jurors.    Catano's  argument  is\r\n\nforeclosed  by  Fed. R.  Crim. P.  24(c),  which states  that the\r\n\n\"additional peremptory challenges [given  when the court impanels\r\n\nalternates] may be  used against  an alternate juror  only.\"   We\r\n\nwill  not   hamstring  the   district  courts  in   dealing  with\r\n\nunanticipated events  during trial.   The district court  did not\r\n\nabuse its discretion in the jury selection process. \r\n\n       V.  LACK OF INSTRUCTION DEFINING \"REASONABLE DOUBT\"\r                 V.

This  court  has\r\n\nspecifically held that the  district court has discretion whether\r\n\nto  define \"reasonable doubt\".  United States v.

Moreover, we find support for  this rule in the Supreme\r\n\nCourt's recent decision in  Victor v. Nebraska, 114 S.

If the court instructs that the burden of proof\r\n\nis  \"beyond a  reasonable  doubt,\"  and  if  the  instruction  is\r\n\nprominent,  not  \"buried  as  an  aside,\"   there  is  no  error.\r\n\nOlmstead, 832 F.2d at 646.

Other circuits have used the \"related\" language without\r\n\ndiscussion.   See, e.g., United States v.

Acceptance of Responsibility\r                    A.  Acceptance of Responsibility\r\n\n          The sentencing court  has great discretion in  deciding\r\n\nwhether to grant an  adjustment for acceptance of responsibility,\r\n\nUnited States v. Ruiz, 47 F.3d  452, 455 (1st Cir. 1995), because\r                               \r\n\n\"[t]he sentencing judge  is in  a unique position  to evaluate  a\r\n\ndefendant's  acceptance   of  responsibility.\"    USSG     3E1.1,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5     Witnesses   at  trial   detailed  the   transportation  and\r\ndistribution  of six loads of marijuana from Texas to Boston over\r\na  three year period.

We  review  that evaluation  for  clear error.\r\n\nRuiz,  47  F.3d  at 455.    See  USSG     3E1.1,  comment.

The\r              \r\n\nguideline  commentary  notes  that   \"[i]n  rare  situations,\"  a\r\n\ndefendant  can proceed  to trial  and receive  a reduction  under\r                                               \r\n\nsection 3E1.1.

For  example, a\r\n\ndefendant may receive a reduction after going to trial \"to assert\r\n\nand preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt (e.g.  to\r                                                                       \r\n\nmake  a constitutional challenge to  a statute or  a challenge to\r\n\nthe applicability of a statute  to his conduct).\"  Ruiz, 47  F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat  455.  Here, however, Michael Murray did not plead guilty, but\r\n\nrather tried his case \"on the basis of reasonable doubt,\" Michael\r\n\nMurray's  Br. at 42, thus contesting  his factual guilt.  We will\r\n\ngenerally sustain a district court's refusal to grant a reduction\r\n\nfor  acceptance of  responsibility  when the  defendant does  not\r\n\nplead guilty.  Ruiz, 47 F.3d at 456.  We do so here.\r                             \r\n\n          B.  Substantial Assistance\r                    B.  Substantial Assistance\r\n\n          Michael  Murray next  argues  that  the district  court\r\n\nerred in denying his request for a downward departure due to  his\r\n\nsubstantial assistance  to the government.   USSG     5K1.1, p.s.\r\n\n(Nov.  1993).  He contends  that either the  government should be\r\n\ncompelled  to  file   a  5K1.1  motion  because  of   his  actual\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nassistance,  or that the district court should have deemed such a\r\n\nmotion filed despite government inaction.  Both arguments fail.\r\n\n          Section  5K1.1 conditions  departure upon  a government\r\n\nmotion.   This  condition \"gives  the Government  a power,  not a\r\n\nduty,  to   file  a  motion  when   defendant  has  substantially\r\n\nassisted.\"  Wade v. United States, 504 U.S. 181, 185 (1992).  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v. Raineri, 42 F.3d 36, 44 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding\r                                  \r\n\nthat because a 5K1.1 motion is discretionary, \"the government may\r\n\nchoose to insist on  quite a lot of assistance if  it wants to do\r\n\nso\"),  cert.  denied,  115   S.

Michael Murray\r                                         \r\n\nhas alleged no unconstitutional  motive and is not entitled  to a\r\n\nremedy for the government's refusal to file a 5K1.1 motion.\r\n\n          Finally, Michael Murray  argues that his assistance  to\r\n\nthe  government  was  to  a degree  \"not  adequately  taken  into\r\n\nconsideration by the Sentencing Commission.\"  USSG   5K2.0,  p.s.\r\n\n(Nov.  1993).  We have  held that \"it  is theoretically possible,\r\n\nalbeit  unlikely\"  that  substantial   assistance  would  be   an\r\n\nextraordinary mitigating circumstance within the ambit of section\r\n\n5K2.0.  United States v. Romolo, 937 F.2d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                                         \r\n\nHowever,  this   is  not   \"the  rare  case   where  governmental\r\n\nintractability in the face of overwhelming evidence of enormously\r\n\nfruitful  cooperation might  fairly be  said  to have  deprived a\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\ndefendant  of his due.\"   United States  v. La Guardia,  902 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n1010, 1018  (1st Cir.  1990) (refusing  to depart  downward under\r\n\nsection 5K1.1 although defendants cooperated where government did\r\n\nnot file  motion).   In sentencing  Michael Murray, the  district\r\n\ncourt  recognized its  authority  to depart  below the  guideline\r\n\nrange,  but declined to do so.

Therefore,\r\n\nwe incorporate by reference  the statement of the case  and facts\r\n\nfrom the published portion of  our opinion of the same date.   We\r\n\nhere discuss and  affirm the  rulings of the  district court  in:\r\n\n(1) denying James Murray's  suppression motion; (2) denying Jaime\r\n\nCatano's motion for severance;  (3) denying Jaime Catano's motion\r\n\nto participate  in Michael  Murray's omnibus motion  hearing; (4)\r\n\nmanaging the use of peremptory challenges; (5) refusing to define\r\n\nreasonable  doubt;  (6)  convicting  Jaime  Catano of  continuing\r\n\ncriminal enterprise; and (7)  refusing to adjust Michael Murray's\r\n\nsentence for acceptance of responsibility or to depart downward.\r\n\n              I.  JAMES MURRAY'S SUPPRESSION MOTION\r                        I.  JAMES MURRAY'S SUPPRESSION MOTION\r                                                             \r\n\n          James Murray  argues that  the district court  erred in\r\n\ndenying  his  motion  to   suppress  evidence  police  seized  in\r\n\nwarrantless searches of  James Murray's pickup truck and  a Buick\r\n\nJames Murray had rented.   When the agents arrested  James Murray\r\n\non November 6, 1991, they seized keys to the rented  Buick and to\r\n\nthe pickup truck.  The  Buick was parked at the hotel  where they\r\n\nhad arrested  James Murray.  The  pickup was in a  parking lot of\r\n\nthe  Dallas-Ft.  Worth airport.    The agents  had  both vehicles\r\n\nsearched.  In  the Buick, they found a  rental agreement in James\r\n\nMurray's name,  $2,350 in  cash, a  Smith  Corona typewriter  and\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\ntwelve telephone books from the Southeastern United States.1   In\r\n\nthe  pickup, they found $100,000 cash behind  the seat.  After an\r\n\nevidentiary  hearing,  the district  court denied  James Murray's\r\n\nmotion to suppress  the evidence  seized from the  Buick and  the\r\n\npickup.\r\n\n          James  Murray  argues   that  the  government   had  to\r\n\nestablish  both  probable  cause  and  exigent  circumstances  to\r\n\njustify  the warrantless search of these vehicles, but in this he\r\n\nis  mistaken.   Under  the  automobile  exception to  the  search\r\n\nwarrant requirement, if a  motor vehicle is in transit  or parked\r\n\nin  a public  place,  police may  search  it without  a  warrant,\r\n\nrelying  solely on probable cause.

From  the audio\r\n\ntape supplied by  Nigro, the government  knew Michael Murray  was\r\n\nexpecting  to   obtain  marijuana   from  \"Mexicans,\"   that  the\r\n\nconspirators  were going to Texas for that purpose, and that they\r\n\nwould  have  money to  finance  the  purchase and  transportation\r\n\ncosts.   Shortly  before  Leonel Catano  and  L pez left  in  the\r\n\ntractor-trailer for  Texas, the DEA  overheard their conversation\r\n\nwith  the Murrays,  in  which they  coordinated their  respective\r\n\nduties for the upcoming trip.\r\n\n          By the time they  searched James Murray's vehicles, the\r\n\nDEA agents  had seen the conspirators  take a number of  steps in\r\n\naccordance  with  the   plans  laid  out  in  this   video  taped\r\n\nconversation.   In  the  tape,  the group  agreed  to go  to  the\r\n\n\"crane,\" and  they later went to  a crane yard, where  they put a\r\n\nsteel tank on their trailer.  (There was evidence that  the group\r\n\nhad used that tank before to  transport marijuana.)  In the  tape\r\n\nMichael Murray said that he would get  money and Leonel should go\r\n\nto a truck stop; later that day, aerial surveillance agents saw a\r\n\nparked  sedan (such  as  Michael  Murray  was  driving)  next  to\r\n\nLeonel's truck in the truck area of a highway rest stop.  The car\r\n\nand truck left the rest stop at the same time.  In the video tape\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nMichael Murray said that James Murray would \"go and he's going to\r\n\nhave  money to pay the other transportation people up in Dallas;\"\r\n\nthree days later, James Murray  showed up in McAllen, Texas in  a\r\n\ncar  rented at  the  Dallas-Fort Worth  airport.   In  the  taped\r\n\nconversation  Michael  Murray  had  instructed  L pez  and Leonel\r\n\nCatano  to \"go  to  Dallas, drop  the  box  then just  come,  ah,\r\n\nbobtail.\"  Leonel Catano and  L pez did in fact drop  the trailer\r\n\noff in Luling and \"bobtail\" to McAllen.\r\n\n          From the  taped conversation and subsequent  actions of\r\n\nthe  parties to  that conversation,  the government  had probable\r\n\ncause to believe  that James Murray was  involved in a scheme  to\r\n\nbuy marijuana in south Texas and transport it north, and that  he\r\n\nwould be carrying a  significant amount of money  to pay for  the\r\n\ntransportation  costs.  His rental car and his truck were logical\r\n\nplaces  to look for the money.  The district court did not err in\r\n\nfinding probable cause,  or in denying  James Murray's motion  to\r\n\nsuppress.\r\n\n             II.

JAIME CATANO'S MOTION TO PARTICIPATE\r                      III.  JAIME CATANO'S MOTION TO PARTICIPATE\r                                                                \r\n\n          Jaime Catano sought to participate in  Michael Murray's\r\n\nomnibus hearing  described in  Part I  of our  published opinion.\r\n\nJaime  Catano contended  that Michael  Murray's bargain  with the\r\n\ngovernment  would benefit Jaime Catano  as well.   He argues that\r\n\nhis  participation  would  have   allowed  him  to  cross-examine\r\n\nwitnesses as to the benefit which  he would receive from his  own\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nand from Michael  Murray's cooperation with  the government.   He\r\n\nfurther  argues that  he  could have  \"threshed out\"  discussions\r\n\nbetween himself  and the DEA  and \"gleaned\"  any information  the\r\n\ngovernment  learned about him from Michael Murray.  At the motion\r\n\nhearing,  Jaime  Catano's  counsel  orally  moved  the  court  to\r\n\nintervene and  examine witnesses.  The district judge ruled, \"I'm\r\n\nnot going  to let you examine, but on the  other hand, you file a\r\n\nmotion supported  by an affidavit  and I'll  deal with it.\"   The\r\n\njudge also stated that Jaime Catano had no standing to intervene.\r\n\nLater,  Jaime Catano's  counsel again orally  moved the  court to\r\n\nparticipate in the hearing.  Again the  judge stated, \"I told you\r\n\nto make a motion.  I told you to support your motion.  You  get a\r\n\nmotion.  I'll rule on it. . . . But two days have gone by, I have\r\n\nno  motion, the matter is between Mr. Murray and the government.\"\r\n\nAfter  the hearing  concluded and  the trial began,  Jaime Catano\r\n\nserved  a \"Motion for Relief\"  on the government  with a two-page\r\n\nunsigned  affidavit attached  which  purported to  be from  Jaime\r\n\nCatano.  The motion  asked that the charges against  Jaime Catano\r\n\nbe dismissed or, in the alternative, \"that the agreement with the\r\n\ngovernment   between  Catano,   Michael  Murray  and   the  other\r\n\ndefendants be enforced.\"  Jaime Catano's \"affidavit\" alleged that\r\n\na  DEA special  agent contacted  him and  urged him  to cooperate\r\n\n\"which would  result in a sentence for me of less than five years\r\n\nsince Michael Murray would  get no more than  five years for  his\r\n\nsentence.\"    The  affidavit  also  alleged  that  \"when  Michael\r\n\n[Murray] told me that the government wasn't going to give him the\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nzero  to five year deal after he  set up the fentanyl lab, I told\r\n\n[the special agent] that he was going to have to give Michael and\r\n\nthe  rest of  us our deal  if he  wanted me  to cooperate.\"   The\r\n\naffidavit  conspicuously  fails  to  allege  that   Jaime  Catano\r\n\nactually cooperated  or  detrimentally relied  in any  way.   The\r\n\ngovernment  disputes that  this  motion and  affidavit were  ever\r\n\nfiled in  the district court.   On appeal, Jaime  Catano does not\r\n\nargue  that the district court wrongfully denied the motion, only\r\n\nthat the  district court  wrongfully denied him  participation in\r\n\nMichael Murray's hearing.\r\n\n          This argument fails for two  reasons:  (1) as discussed\r\n\nabove, Jaime Catano did not timely move the court in writing  for\r\n\nparticipation in Michael Murray's hearing as the court requested;\r\n\nand (2) Jaime Catano had no standing to intervene as he had shown\r\n\nneither an agreement  intended to  benefit him directly  or as  a\r\n\nthird-party  beneficiary,2 nor  any  cooperation  or  detrimental\r\n\nreliance on  his part.

LEONEL CATANO'S OBJECTION TO THE PROCEDURE\r                                                                  \r\n                    FOR PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES\r                              FOR PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES\r                                                       \r\n\n          Leonel Catano  argues that the district  court erred in\r\n\nits  management of  peremptory challenges  by reconstituting  the\r\n\nvenire  after  Catano   had  already  exercised  his   peremptory\r\n\nchallenges,  without permitting Catano a chance  to strike any of\r\n\nthe new veniremen.\r\n\n          The court used a \"jury  box\" system of jury  selection.\r\n\nSee  generally  8A  James  Wm. Moore,  Moore's  Federal  Practice\r                        \r\n\n  24.05[1]  (2d ed. Feb. 1995 rev.).   First, the court asked the\r\n\nentire  venire  questions to  determine  whether  there were  any\r\n\nreasons that particular  jurors could not be  impartial.  Several\r\n\njurors were excused at this point, so that the venire dwindled to\r\n\ntwenty-seven  people.    The  court announced  it  would  impanel\r\n\nfourteen  people--enough for  twelve jurors and  two alternates--\r\n\nthen permit each side  to make peremptory challenges.   The court\r\n\nwould refill the box with new veniremen to replace the challenged\r\n\nveniremen until  both sides  had used  their  challenges or  were\r\n\nsatisfied  with  the  panel.   The  government  would have  seven\r\n\nperemptory challenges and  the defendants eleven.  Fed.  R. Crim.\r\n\nP. 24(b)  and (c).   The last two  jurors to  remain unchallenged\r\n\nwould be  the alternates.  The government  exercised four strikes\r\n\non the first  panel, then  the defendants exercised  seven.   The\r\n\ncourt filled the eleven seats left vacant by the strikes with new\r\n\nveniremen  for round two.   The defense challenged  four of these\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\neleven,  and  the government  challenged  two.   Thus,  after two\r\n\nrounds  a  total  of eight  jurors  had  been  selected, and  the\r\n\ndefendants had used up all their challenges.\r\n\n          At this point there were not enough remaining veniremen\r\n\nto  refill the  jury  box.    Therefore,  the  court  called  the\r\n\nremaining two  veniremen into the  box, and the  government chose\r\n\nnot to  challenge them.  Of  necessity, the court  called for new\r\n\nveniremen  to be  brought  in  from the  jury  pool.   Since  the\r\n\ndefendants were  out of peremptory challenges  and the government\r\n\ndeclined to  exercise its remaining challenge, all  four of these\r\n\nnew veniremen  were impaneled.  However,  the defendants objected\r\n\nto one  of  these jurors,  arguing  that they  had  no chance  to\r\n\nchallenge  him.  The court replied that the defendants had simply\r\n\nused  up their  allotted number  of strikes,  and that  the court\r\n\nwould not allow them extra challenges.\r\n\n          After the jury  had been  selected, there  was a  delay\r\n\nbefore trial  while  the court  conducted  motion hearings.    It\r\n\nhappened that during this hiatus  the court had to excuse  two of\r\n\nthe  jurors.  It decided  to impanel four  new alternates, making\r\n\nthe two previous alternates deliberating  jurors.  The court gave\r\n\neach side two peremptory challenges to use on  this supplementary\r\n\njury selection.\r\n\n          Leonel  Catano  argues  that  the  court's  system  was\r\n\nunfair, apparently because he had no opportunity to strike any of\r\n\nthe  veniremen in the third  round of the  regular jury selection\r\n\nand these included new veniremen not in the original venire.  His\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nargument  is  unfounded.    The district  court  has  substantial\r\n\ndiscretion to  regulate the  use of peremptory  challenges within\r\n\nthe framework of Federal  Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(b).   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited  States v.

After\r                               \r\n\nthe initial  voir dire and before  the court filled the  jury box\r\n\nfor the  first round,  the venire  had  dwindled to  twenty-seven\r\n\npeople.   The court announced  at the outset  that the government\r\n\nand   defendants   together   would   have   eighteen  peremptory\r\n\nchallenges.    Twelve  jurors  and two  alternates  were  needed.\r\n\nSimple arithmetic made it  apparent at the outset that  the court\r\n\nmight have to  call more veniremen  to get  enough for the  jury.\r\n\nThe defendants used up their peremptories on the original venire,\r\n\nwithout knowing who might  walk in the door next.  Having created\r\n\ntheir own predicament, they have no cause to complain.\r\n\n          Though  his argument  is  unclear,  Leonel Catano  also\r\n\nappears  to object to the court's procedure when events after the\r\n\ninitial jury selection made it necessary to select more alternate\r\n\njurors.  The  court announced  it would give  the defendants  two\r\n\nadditional challenges  because of this new  development, but that\r\n\nthe challenges could only be used on newly impanelled jurors, not\r\n\nthose already seated.  Leonel Catano argues that the court should\r\n\nhave permitted the  use of the new  challenges to strike the  old\r\n\njurors, two of whom were initially designated  alternates but now\r\n\nwould  be deliberating jurors.  The court did not anticipate that\r\n\nit would be necessary to  supplement the jury when the panel  was\r\n\ninitially  chosen.  When  unexpected events made  it necessary to\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nimpanel new alternates, there was no reason the court should have\r\n\nto open up the  existing panel to new challenges.  This  is not a\r\n\ncase  like United States  v. Sams,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"307101\"><a href=\"/opinion/307101/united-states-v-john-newton-sams-aka-adolphus-john-sams/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">751</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 755  (5th Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1972), in  which the  defendant was  surprised by an  unannounced\r\n\nrule that prevented him  from striking the first group  of jurors\r\n\nin later  rounds.   Here, the  defendants  understood the  system\r\n\ninitially employed.  If  the court had not  impanelled additional\r\n\nalternates  (which  was  undoubtedly   in  its  discretion),  the\r\n\nremaining twelve jurors would  have deliberated and Leonel Catano\r\n\nwould have no  argument.
