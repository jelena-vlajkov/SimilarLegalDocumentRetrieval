Consequent-\n     ly,  in  cases involving  LSD  contained  in a  carrier\n     medium,  the Commission  has established  a weight  per\n     dose of  0.4 milligram for purposes  of determining the\n     base offense level.\n\n                                4\n\ngram  per-dose  formula may  receive  retroactive application  in\n\nappropriate  circumstances  to  effect  reductions  in  sentences\n\npreviously imposed.   See  U.S.S.G.    1B1.10(a), (d)  (1993); 18\n                         \n\nU.S.C.    3582(c)(2); United States v. Holmes, 13 F.3d 1217, 1222\n                                             \n\n(8th Cir. 1994) (district courts  have discretion to apply Amend-\n\nment 488 retroactively in appropriate circumstances).2  \n\n                    \n\n          The dosage weight of LSD selected exceeds the Drug\n     Enforcement Administration's standard  dosage unit  for\n     LSD of 0.05 milligram (i.e., the quantity of actual LSD\n                                \n     per dose) in order to assign some weight to the carrier\n     medium.  Because LSD typically is marketed and consumed\n     orally  on  a carrier  medium,  the  inclusion of  some\n     weight  attributable to  the carrier  medium recognizes\n     (A)  that  offense  levels for  most  other  controlled\n     substances  are based  upon the  weight of  the mixture\n     containing the  controlled substance without  regard to\n     purity,  and  (B) the  decision  in  Chapman v.  United\n                                                            \n     States, 111  S. Ct. 1919 (1991) (holding  that the term\n           \n     \"mixture  or substance\"  in 21  U.S.C.    841(b)(1) in-\n     cludes the  carrier medium  in which LSD  is absorbed).\n     At  the same time, the weight per dose selected is less\n     than the weight per dose that would equate  the offense\n     level for LSD  on a  carrier medium with  that for  the\n     same  number of  doses of  PCP, a  controlled substance\n     that comparative assessments indicate is more likely to\n     induce violent  acts and  ancillary crime than  is LSD.\n     (Treating  LSD  on a  carrier  medium  as weighing  0.5\n     milligram per dose would produce offense levels equiva-\n     lent to  those for  PCP.)   Thus, the  approach decided\n     upon by the  Commission will  harmonize offense  levels\n     for LSD  offenses with those for  other controlled sub-\n     stances and avoid any undue influence of varied carrier\n     weight on the applicable offense level.\n\nU.S.S.G.   2D1.1, comment. (n.18).\n\n     2Section 3582 provides, in pertinent part:\n\n     The court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it\n     has been imposed except that    \n     ....\n\n                                5\n\n          Absent  the  MMS   complication  posed  by   21  U.S.C.\n\n  841(b)(1)(B)(v), Amendment 488 would have resulted in a dramat-\n\nic decrease in  appellant's prison sentence, since  it sliced the\n\nGSR  from  121-151 months  (11.6 grams  of  LSD) to  27-33 months\n\n(0.239 gram).   Due to 21 U.S.C.    841(b)(1)(B)(v), however, the\n\ndistrict court  refused to reduce  Boot's prison  term below  the\n\nfive-year  MMS.   See U.S.S.G    5G1.1(b)  (\"Where  a statutorily\n                     \n\nrequired minimum  sentence  is greater  than the  maximum of  the\n\napplicable  guideline  range,  the statutorily  required  minimum\n\nsentence shall be the guidelines range.\").\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          The long and the short of the district court ruling was\n\nthat  the LSD quantity  calculation is controlled  by Chapman for\n                                                             \n\nMMS purposes and by Amendment  488 for GSR purposes.

Thus, unless  Amendment 488 is  to be converted  into an\n\ninstrument  for  promoting  sentencing  disparity,  congressional\n\nacquiescence  in its  adoption must  be considered  tantamount to\n\nlegislative  displacement  of  the  Chapman regime.    We  do not\n                                           \n\nagree.3 \n\n          Although the  precise issue  presented is one  of first\n\nimpression  in  the courts  of  appeals,4  the  Supreme Court  in\n\nChapman concluded that Congress intended,  at the time it enacted\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     3Contrary to Boot's contention,  Amendment 488, as presently\ninterpreted,  eliminates considerable past  and future sentencing\n                        \ndisparity in LSD cases, see U.S.S.G.   2D1.1, comment. (n.18), by\n                           \nsubstituting, in all non-MMS cases, a uniform 0.4  milligram per-\ndose  formula  for calculating  the  LSD  \"mixture or  substance\"\nweight in  place of the entire  actual weight of the  LSD and its\ncarrier medium.  See supra note 1.  The very substantial 61-month\n                          \nreduction  in Boot's  sentence  underscores the  point.   Further\nefforts at reducing sentencing disparity in LSD cases must  await\nimproved coordination  between Amendment  488 and  its preemptive\ncounterpart    the  MMS regime     long recognized as an  \"ad hoc\ndeviation\"  from  the  unitary  policy goals  of  the  Sentencing\nGuidelines, United  States v.
