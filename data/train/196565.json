After investigating Osinubi's\r\n\ncharge, the  EEOC brought  this action  against Green in  the\r\n\nUnited   States   District   Court   for  the   District   of\r\n\nMassachusetts  alleging  sexual   and  racial  harassment  in\r\n\nviolation  of Title VII of  the Civil Rights  Act of 1964, 42\r\n\nU.S.C.   2000e et seq.   Green moved to dismiss the complaint\r                                 \r\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P.  12(b)(6), arguing that Osinubi's claim\r\n\nwas  untimely,   having  been   filed  outside   the  180-day\r\n\nlimitations  period outlined  in section  706(e)(1) of  Title\r\n\nVII,  42 U.S.C.   2000e-5(e)(1).   The district court agreed,\r\n\nand  because  Green's  Motion  to  Dismiss presented  matters\r\n\noutside the pleadings, the  court treated it as a  motion for\r\n\nsummary judgment and granted summary judgment for Green.  The\r\n\nEEOC appeals.  For the reasons discussed below, we reverse.  \r\n\n                              I.\r                                            \r\n\n                          BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\nA.  Title VII\r                         \r\n\n          Under section 706(e)(1), a charge of employment\r\n\ndiscrimination generally must be filed with the EEOC within\r\n\n180 days of the last alleged act of discrimination.  42\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nU.S.C.   2000e-5(e)(1).1   However, if a claimant initially\r\n\ninstitutes proceedings with a state or local agency, a charge\r\n\ncan be filed with the EEOC up to 300 days after the\r\n\ndiscriminatory act.  Id.\r                                    \r\n\n          Section 706(c) provides that where an alleged\r\n\ndiscriminatory employment practice has occurred in a so-\r\n\ncalled \"deferral state\" (a state that has its own anti-\r\n\ndiscrimination laws and enforcement agency), the deferral\r\n\nstate has sixty days of exclusive jurisdiction over the\r\n\nclaim, and only after the sixty days have expired or the\r\n\nproceedings have been \"earlier terminated\" can the charge be\r\n\nfiled with the EEOC.  42 U.S.C.   2000e-5(c).2  The sixty-\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  In relevant part, section 706(e)(1) reads:\r\n\n          A  charge  under  this  section  shall be\r\n          filed  [with the EEOC] within one hundred\r\n          and   eighty   days  after   the  alleged\r\n          unlawful employment practice occurred . .\r\n          . , except  that in a case of an unlawful\r\n          employment practice with respect to which\r\n          the   person   aggrieved  has   initially\r\n          instituted  proceedings  with a  State or\r\n          local agency  with authority to  grant or\r\n          seek  relief  from  such  practice  or to\r\n          institute   criminal   proceedings   with\r\n          respect  thereto  upon  receiving  notice\r\n          thereof, such charge shall be filed by or\r\n          on  behalf of the person aggrieved within\r\n          three  hundred  days  after  the  alleged\r\n          employment practice occurred . . . .\r\n\n42 U.S.C.   2000e-5(e)(1).   \r\n\n2.  In relevant part, section 706(c) reads:\r\n\n          In  the  case  of  an   alleged  unlawful\r\n          employment practice occurring in a State,\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nday period of exclusive jurisdiction is intended to \"give\r\n\nStates and localities an opportunity to combat discrimination\r\n\nfree from premature federal intervention.\"  EEOC v.\r                                                            \r\n\nCommercial Office Prods. Co., 486 U.S. 107, 110 (1988).  Many\r                                        \r\n\nstate agencies, in order to facilitate the federal processing\r\n\nof charges, have entered into \"worksharing agreements\" with\r\n\nthe EEOC in which the state agency agrees to waive its right\r\n\nto the sixty-day period of exclusive jurisdiction for certain\r\n\ncategories of claims.\r\n\n          Massachusetts is a deferral state and the\r\n\nMassachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\") is\r\n\nthe agency responsible for enforcing Massachusetts's anti-\r\n\ndiscrimination laws.  The EEOC and the MCAD have entered into\r\n\na Worksharing Agreement to avoid duplication of effort by\r\n\napportioning the responsibilities for processing charges.  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          .  . .  which has  a State  or local  law\r\n          prohibiting   the   unlawful   employment\r\n          practice  alleged   and  establishing  or\r\n          authorizing a State or local authority to\r\n          grant or seek relief from such practice .\r\n          . .  no charge  may be filed  under [this\r\n          section] by the  person aggrieved  before\r\n          the  expiration  of   sixty  days   after\r\n          proceedings  have  been  commenced  under\r\n          State   or   local   law,   unless   such\r\n          proceedings have  been earlier terminated\r\n          . . . . \r\n\n42 U.S.C.   2000e-5(c).\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nB.  Facts\r                     \r\n\n          In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, we\r\n\nrecite the facts in the light most favorable to the non-\r\n\nmoving party.  See Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d\r                                                           \r\n\n816, 822 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 985 (1992).\r                                                  \r\n\n          Green hired Osinubi as a paralegal in October of\r\n\n1992.  Osinubi later left Green's employment allegedly\r\n\nbecause a work environment fraught with sexual harassment\r\n\nmade work intolerable.  On December 29, 1993, Osinubi filed a\r\n\ncharge of sexual harassment and constructive discharge with\r\n\nthe EEOC.  Osinubi did not file a separate charge with the\r\n\nMCAD.\r\n\n          At the top of her EEOC charge form, in the space\r\n\nprovided for naming the state or local agency, if any,\r\n\nOsinubi typed \"Mass Comm Against Discrimination.\"  Osinubi\r\n\nfailed, however, to mark a box in the lower left-hand corner\r\n\nthat stated, \"I want this charge filed with both the EEOC and\r\n\nthe State or local Agency, if any.\"  Osinubi also indicated\r\n\non the charge form that the latest date that discrimination\r\n\ntook place was June 20, 1993, 191 days prior to her filing\r\n\nthe charge.  After investigating the charge, the EEOC\r\n\ncommenced this sexual harassment and race discrimination\r\n\naction in federal district court on December 7, 1994.\r\n\n          On February 8, 1995, Green moved to dismiss the\r\n\ncomplaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), contending that the\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nEEOC's claim was time-barred because of Osinubi's failure to\r\n\nfile her charge within 180 days of the last alleged act of\r\n\ndiscrimination.  Green further maintained that the EEOC could\r\n\nnot avail itself of the extended 300-day limitations period\r\n\nbecause the extension only applies to claimants who have\r\n\nfirst filed with the state agency and Osinubi's charge was\r\n\nnever filed with the MCAD.  To support this factual\r\n\nproposition, Green attached to its motion the affidavit of\r\n\nJane Brayton, executive assistant to the MCAD Commissioners,\r\n\nstating that her review of the MCAD computer files revealed\r\n\nno record of Osinubi's charge having been filed with the\r\n\nMCAD.\r\n\n          On March 6, 1995, the EEOC filed its Opposition to\r\n\nthe Motion to Dismiss and attached the affidavit of Elizabeth\r\n\nGrossman, an EEOC trial attorney.3  In her affidavit,\r\n\nGrossman stated, inter alia, that the EEOC had forwarded a\r                                       \r\n\ncopy of Osinubi's charge to the MCAD on December 29, 1993. \r\n\nGrossman supported this statement with a copy of the EEOC's\r\n\ncharge transmittal form for Osinubi's charge, dated 12/29/93\r\n\nand addressed to the MCAD.  The form, however, was not signed\r\n\nby an officer of the MCAD indicating the MCAD's receipt.  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Grossman  attached  to her  affidavit  the following  six\r\nexhibits:   a copy of Osinubi's charge,  her notes of a phone\r\nconversation   with  Green's  attorney,   the  EEOC's  charge\r\ntransmittal form addressed to  the MCAD for Osinubi's charge,\r\nthe  EEOC-MCAD Worksharing  Agreement,  letters from  Green's\r\nattorney to the  EEOC investigator, and the EEOC's  letter of\r\ndetermination. \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          On March 13, 1995, Green moved to strike the charge\r\n\ntransmittal form and that portion of Grossman's Affidavit\r\n\nregarding the EEOC's forwarding of Osinubi's charge.  Green\r\n\ncontended that the charge transmittal form was\r\n\nunauthenticated, did not prove filing with and receipt by the\r\n\nMCAD, and that Grossman has no personal knowledge of the\r\n\nEEOC's forwarding of Osinubi's charge to the MCAD.\r\n\n          On March 23, 1995, the EEOC filed its Opposition to\r\n\nthe Motion to Strike.  The EEOC responded that Grossman could\r\n\nattest to routine EEOC procedures and thereby authenticate\r\n\nthe charge transmittal form and that Osinubi's charge was\r\n\nconstructively filed with the MCAD when the EEOC forwarded it\r\n\nto the MCAD on December 29, 1993.  In the alternative, the\r\n\nEEOC argued that even if the MCAD's receipt of Osinubi's\r\n\ncharge was required to initiate MCAD proceedings, it could\r\n\nverify such receipt with the attached affidavit of Walter W.\r\n\nHoran, the EEOC Program Coordinator for the MCAD.  In his\r\n\nattached affidavit, Horan stated that he was the MCAD's\r\n\ncustodian of records of EEOC charges forwarded to the MCAD\r\n\nand that MCAD records indicated that the MCAD received a copy\r\n\nof Osinubi's charge on January 6, 1994.  Horan attached to\r\n\nhis affidavit a signed copy of the charge transmittal form\r\n\nacknowledging the MCAD's receipt of Osinubi's charge.  \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nC.  District Court Opinion\r                                      \r\n\n          On March 29, 1995, the district court issued its\r\n\nopinion resolving the Motion to Dismiss and the Motion to\r\n\nStrike.  The court began its opinion by noting that because\r\n\nmatters outside the pleadings were presented, it was\r\n\nconverting Green's motion to dismiss for failure to state a\r\n\nclaim to a motion for summary judgment.  The district court\r\n\nhad not previously notified the parties of its intention to\r\n\nconvert.  The court then explained that to qualify for the\r\n\nextended limitations period, Osinubi or the EEOC on Osinubi's\r\n\nbehalf must have initially filed charges with the MCAD.  The\r\n\ncourt found, however, that neither Osinubi nor the EEOC had\r\n\ndone so.  With respect to Osinubi, the court viewed her\r\n\nfailure to check the box on the EEOC charge form as evincing\r\n\na preference not to have her charge filed with the MCAD.\r\n\n          The EEOC, the court found, had also failed to file\r\n\nOsinubi's charge with the MCAD.  The court assumed arguendo\r                                                                       \r\n\nthat Grossman's contested attestation that the EEOC had\r\n\nforwarded Osinubi's charge to the MCAD was admissible.  The\r\n\ncourt held, however, that merely forwarding the charge to the\r\n\nMCAD was not sufficient to initiate MCAD proceedings and\r\n\nthereby trigger the extended limitations period; proof that\r\n\nthe MCAD actually received the forwarded charge also was\r\n\nnecessary.  \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          Despite Horan's verification of the MCAD's receipt\r\n\nof Osinubi's charge, the district court found that the EEOC\r\n\nhad not contested Brayton's assertion that the MCAD had no\r\n\nrecord of receiving Osinubi's charge.  Accepting this\r\n\n\"uncontested\" fact as true, the court reasoned as follows: \r\n\nbecause the MCAD never received a copy of Osinubi's charge, a\r\n\nprecondition to invoking the 300-day extended limitations\r\n\nperiod had not been satisfied; thus, the general 180-day\r\n\nlimitations period applied, and the EEOC's complaint was\r\n\ntime-barred.  The district court made no mention of the Horan\r\n\nAffidavit and did not explain the reason for its failure to\r\n\nconsider it.  \r\n\n            Finally, the district court dismissed the EEOC's\r\n\nargument that paragraph II.A. of the EEOC-MCAD Worksharing\r\n\nAgreement (\"[the MCAD] designates [the EEOC] as its agent for\r\n\nthe purpose of receiving charges\") allows MCAD proceedings to\r\n\nbe initiated upon the EEOC's receipt of a charge and without\r                                        \r\n\nadditional notice to the MCAD.

Mass. 1986), the court\r                    \r\n\nheld that filing with the state agency is a precondition to\r\n\ninvoking the extended limitations period and that to allow\r\n\notherwise, e.g., by way of worksharing agreement, would be\r\n\ninconsistent with the scheme Congress established.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n                             II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          On appeal, the EEOC argues that the district court\r\n\nerred in granting summary judgment because:  (1) in paragraph\r\n\nII.A. of the EEOC-MCAD Worksharing Agreement, the MCAD\r\n\ndesignated the EEOC as its agent for receiving charges and\r\n\ntherefore MCAD proceedings were initiated when the EEOC\r\n\nreceived Osinubi's charge, thereby qualifying Osinubi for the\r\n\nextended limitations period and (2) even if actual receipt by\r\n\nthe MCAD was required to commence MCAD proceedings, the Horan\r\n\nAffidavit provided ample evidence that the MCAD received\r\n\nOsinubi's charge to contradict the Brayton Affidavit and\r\n\ncreate a genuine issue of material fact.  \r\n\n          Because we find the EEOC's second argument\r\n\ndispositive, we do not consider its first claim except to\r\n\noffer the following observation from our examination of the\r\n\nEEOC-MCAD Worksharing Agreement.  While Title VII4 and the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Title  VII encourages  cooperation between  the EEOC  and\r\nstate and local agencies  and authorizes the formalization of\r\nsuch  cooperative  efforts in  written  agreements.   Section\r\n705(g)(1)  empowers the  EEOC  \"to cooperate  with and,  with\r\ntheir consent,  utilize  regional, State,  local,  and  other\r\nagencies.\"    42  U.S.C.    2000e-4(g)(1).    Section  709(b)\r\nprovides that \"[i]n furtherance of such cooperative  efforts,\r\nthe Commission  may enter  into written agreements  with such\r\nState  or  local agencies.\"   42  U.S.C.    2000e-8(b).   The\r\nSupreme Court has interpreted these sections to \"envision the\r\nestablishment of  some sort of worksharing agreements between\r\nthe  EEOC  and  state  and  local  agencies\"  and  to  permit\r\nprovisions within  these worksharing agreements  \"designed to\r\navoid unnecessary  duplication of  effort or waste  of time.\"\r\nEEOC  v.  Commercial Office  Prods.  Co., 486  U.S.  107, 122\r                                                    \r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\ncase law of other circuits5 support the conclusion that\r\n\nworksharing agreements can permit state proceedings to be\r\n\nautomatically initiated when the EEOC receives the charge, it\r\n\nis unclear from the language of the EEOC-MCAD Worksharing\r\n\nAgreement whether the EEOC and the MCAD intended MCAD\r\n\nproceedings to be initiated upon the EEOC's receipt.6\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n(1988).\r\n\n5.  See Griffin v. City  of Dallas, 26 F.3d 610,  612-13 (5th\r                                              \r\nCir. 1994) (holding  that, under the  terms of a  worksharing\r\nagreement between  the EEOC and the Texas Commission on Human\r\nRights (\"TCHR\"),  the EEOC's  acceptance of  a charge  as the\r\nTCHR's agent instituted state  proceedings within the meaning\r\nof section 706(e)(1)); Hong v. Children's Memorial Hosp., 936\r                                                                    \r\nF.2d  967, 970-71  (7th Cir.  1991) (holding  that \"workshare\r\nagreement can alone effect both initiation and termination of\r\nstate proceedings and that, as  a result, plaintiffs may file\r\nwith the EEOC without first filing with the [state agency]\");\r\nSofferin v.

Weirton Steel\r                                                                         \r\nCorp.,  953 F.2d 148, 152 (4th  Cir. 1991) (conceding without\r                 \r\ndeciding that  plaintiff \"may  be correct in  arguing that  a\r\nwork sharing agreement can  be crafted to authorize automatic\r\nimplementation of the requirements of [the ADEA equivalent to\r\nsection 706(e)(1)]\").\r\n\n6.  The  EEOC  and  the MCAD  would  be  wise  to revise  the\r\nlanguage  of  their Worksharing  Agreement  to clarify  their\r\nintent.   Rather  than explicitly  providing that  the EEOC's\r\nreceipt  of  charges  on  the MCAD's  behalf  initiates  MCAD\r\nproceedings  for  purposes  of  section  706(e)(1), paragraph\r\nII.A.  states that  the EEOC  will be  the MCAD's  \"agent for\r\npurposes  of receipt.\"   That  phrase, however,  supports two\r\nreadings:  that the EEOC will act as the MCAD's mailbox, date\r\nstamping  and accepting mail on the MCAD's behalf or that the\r\nEEOC's receipt  of a charge also  initiates MCAD proceedings.\r\nThe  EEOC  and the  MCAD  should  also address  the  apparent\r\nambiguity arising from the Worksharing Agreement's failure to\r\ndefine terms such as \"appropriate charges\" in paragraph II.D.\r\nand  to  distinguish  the  \"advance  waivers\"  of   paragraph\r\nIII.E.11. from the other waivers of paragraph III.E.1-10.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n          After reciting the standard of review, we turn our\r\n\nattention to the EEOC's second argument.  We review a grant\r\n\nof summary judgment de novo and are guided by the same\r                                       \r\n\ncriteria as the district court; a grant of summary judgment\r\n\ncannot stand on appeal \"unless the record discloses no\r\n\ntrialworthy issue of material fact and the moving party is\r\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Alexis v.\r                                                             \r\n\nMcDonald's Restaurants of Mass., Inc., 67 F.3d 341, 346 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1995).\r\n\n          Whether Osinubi's charge enjoys the extended\r\n\nlimitations period and is thereby timely filed depends on\r\n\nwhether the MCAD received a copy of Osinubi's charge.7  The\r\n\nparties have put this material fact in dispute by submitting\r\n\ntwo competing affidavits:   Brayton's assertion that the MCAD\r\n\nhas no record of receiving Osinubi's charge and Horan's\r\n\nattestation to the MCAD's receipt of Osinubi's charge and\r\n\ncharge transmittal form denoting the same.  Accordingly,\r\n\nbecause the record before the district court posed a genuine\r\n\nissue of material fact, summary judgment could have been\r\n\ngranted for Green only if the district court acted within the\r\n\nsphere of its discretion in failing to consider the Horan\r\n\nAffidavit.  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  Because the  EEOC does  not contest the  district court's\r\nruling that forwarding a charge to the MCAD is not sufficient\r\nto  initiate MCAD  proceedings,  we need  not decide  whether\r\nanything less  than the  MCAD's receipt, such  as the  EEOC's\r\nmere forwarding, initiates MCAD proceedings.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          Ordinarily, the district court has broad authority\r\n\nto prescribe the evidentiary materials it will consider in\r\n\ndeciding a motion for summary judgment.  See United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nParcels of Land, 903 F.2d 36, 45-46 (1st Cir. 1990).  We are\r                           \r\n\nreluctant to second-guess the district court in this area and\r\n\nreview such decisions only for a clear abuse of discretion. \r\n\nSee id. at 45. Nonetheless, we conclude that on the very\r                   \r\n\nunusual circumstances of this case, the district court\r\n\noverstepped its authority and abused its discretion in\r\n\nfailing to consider the Horan Affidavit.\r\n\n          The unusual circumstances that motivate this\r\n\ndecision include:  (1) the district court's failure to notify\r\n\nthe parties of its intention to convert Green's Motion to\r\n\nDismiss into a motion for summary judgment, (2) the EEOC's\r\n\nattachment of the Horan Affidavit to a filing that was\r\n\ndirectly related to the Motion to Dismiss, and (3) the\r\n\nprejudice to the EEOC from the court's failure to give notice\r\n\nof its intention to convert.  We discuss each in turn.\r\n\n          Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) has been interpreted to\r\n\nrequire the district court to expressly notify the parties of\r\n\nits intention to convert.  See Chaparro-Febus v.\r                                                         \r\n\nInternational Longshoremen Ass'n, Local 1575, 983 F.2d 325,\r                                                        \r\n\n332 (1st Cir. 1992).  In an effort to be pragmatic, this\r\n\ncourt has excused such a failure when it is harmless.  Id.\r                                                                      \r\n\n(holding the failure harmless \"when the opponent has received\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nthe affidavit and materials, has had an opportunity to\r\n\nrespond to them, and has not controverted their accuracy\"). \r\n\nWe decline to excuse the district court in the instant case,\r\n\nhowever, as we find that its failure to notify the EEOC and\r\n\nGreen of its decision to convert the Motion to Dismiss to one\r\n\nfor summary judgment prejudiced the EEOC because the district\r\n\ncourt failed to consider the Horan Affidavit.    \r\n\n          Although the district court never explained its\r\n\nfailure to consider the Horan Affidavit in its summary\r\n\njudgment order or referred to the Horan Affidavit in any way,\r\n\nwe presume that once it denied the Motion to Strike, the\r\n\ncourt saw no need to consider the EEOC's Opposition to the\r\n\nMotion to Strike and accordingly overlooked the Horan\r\n\nAffidavit referred to therein and attached thereto.  The\r\n\nOpposition to the Motion to Strike, however, was directly\r\n\nrelated to the Motion to Dismiss; the district court had to\r\n\nresolve the Motion to Strike in order to determine which\r\n\naffidavits were properly before it on summary judgment.  As\r\n\nsuch, the Opposition to the Motion to Strike was a filing to\r\n\nwhich a party reasonably might attach evidentiary materials\r\n\nopposing the Motion to Dismiss.8  Having failed to notify\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  In  its  Opposition to  the  Motion to  Strike,  the EEOC\r\nargued that should the  court grant the Motion to  Strike the\r\nGrossman  Affidavit, it  should consider  the  attached Horan\r\nAffidavit  in its place.  While it would have been preferable\r\nfor  the EEOC  to  have attached  the  Horan Affidavit  to  a\r\nseparate  motion   requesting  the  court   to  consider  the\r\naffidavit as newly submitted evidence, the Horan Affidavit is\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nthe parties of its intention to convert, the district court\r\n\nat a minimum should have considered a filing like the Horan\r\n\nAffidavit that had reasonably been attached to an opposition\r\n\nthat was directly related to the Motion to Dismiss.9  \r\n\n          Had the district court followed the prescribed\r\n\napproach of Rule 12(b) and notified the parties of its intent\r\n\nto convert, the EEOC would almost certainly have had the\r\n\nopportunity to ensure that the district court consider the\r\n\nHoran Affidavit.  When a court informs the parties of its\r\n\nintention to convert, ordinarily it provides the parties with\r\n\na minimum of ten days, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), in\r\n\nwhich to augment previous filings.  Had the district court so\r\n\nnotified the parties in the instant case, the EEOC could have\r\n\nresubmitted the Horan Affidavit, attached to an opposition to\r\n\nthe converted motion for summary judgment, and thereby\r\n\nguaranteed its consideration.10  Similarly, had the\r\n\ndistrict court specified which submissions it would consider\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nsufficiently  related  to  the  Motion to  Strike,  that  its\r\nattachment  to  the Opposition  to  the Motion  to  Strike is\r\nreasonable.  \r\n\n9.  In  so holding, we do  not require the  district court to\r\nscour ancillary  filings for hidden  and potentially relevant\r\naffidavits.   A  court need  only refer  to those  filings in\r\nwhich a  party reasonably might include  materials in support\r\nof or in opposition to the motion to dismiss.\r\n\n10.  Local  Rule  56.1  of  the  District   of  Massachusetts\r\nrequires a  district court to consider  evidentiary materials\r\nfiled as exhibits to the opposition to the motion for summary\r\njudgment.  \r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nin making its summary judgment decision, the EEOC could have\r\n\nfiled the Horan Affidavit in compliance therewith.  \r\n\n          As it turned out, however, the district court's\r\n\nfailure to notify the parties of its intention to convert\r\n\nleft the parties in the dark.  Under this unique set of\r\n\ncircumstances, where the district court's failure to notify\r\n\nthe parties of its intention to convert was prejudicial and\r\n\nthe Horan Affidavit was attached to a filing directly related\r\n\nto the Motion to Dismiss, the district court's failure to\r\n\nconsider the Horan Affidavit was an abuse of discretion.  \r\n\n                             III.\r                                             \r\n\n                          CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          Because we find that the Horan and Brayton\r\n\nAffidavits presented the district court with a genuine issue\r\n\nof material fact, we vacate the district court's order\r                                       \r\n\ngranting summary judgment for Green and remand for further\r                                                          \r\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n",

Osinubi later left Green's employment allegedly\r\n\nbecause a work environment fraught with sexual harassment\r\n\nmade work intolerable.  On December 29, 1993, Osinubi filed a\r\n\ncharge of sexual harassment and constructive discharge with\r\n\nthe EEOC.  Osinubi did not file a separate charge with the\r\n\nMCAD.\r\n\n          At the top of her EEOC charge form, in the space\r\n\nprovided for naming the state or local agency, if any,\r\n\nOsinubi typed \"Mass Comm Against Discrimination.\"  Osinubi\r\n\nfailed, however, to mark a box in the lower left-hand corner\r\n\nthat stated, \"I want this charge filed with both the EEOC and\r\n\nthe State or local Agency, if any.\"  Osinubi also indicated\r\n\non the charge form that the latest date that discrimination\r\n\ntook place was June 20, 1993, 191 days prior to her filing\r\n\nthe charge.  After investigating the charge, the EEOC\r\n\ncommenced this sexual harassment and race discrimination\r\n\naction in federal district court on December 7, 1994.\r\n\n          On February 8, 1995, Green moved to dismiss the\r\n\ncomplaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), contending that the\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nEEOC's claim was time-barred because of Osinubi's failure to\r\n\nfile her charge within 180 days of the last alleged act of\r\n\ndiscrimination.  Green further maintained that the EEOC could\r\n\nnot avail itself of the extended 300-day limitations period\r\n\nbecause the extension only applies to claimants who have\r\n\nfirst filed with the state agency and Osinubi's charge was\r\n\nnever filed with the MCAD.  To support this factual\r\n\nproposition, Green attached to its motion the affidavit of\r\n\nJane Brayton, executive assistant to the MCAD Commissioners,\r\n\nstating that her review of the MCAD computer files revealed\r\n\nno record of Osinubi's charge having been filed with the\r\n\nMCAD.\r\n\n          On March 6, 1995, the EEOC filed its Opposition to\r\n\nthe Motion to Dismiss and attached the affidavit of Elizabeth\r\n\nGrossman, an EEOC trial attorney.3  In her affidavit,\r\n\nGrossman stated, inter alia, that the EEOC had forwarded a\r                                       \r\n\ncopy of Osinubi's charge to the MCAD on December 29, 1993. \r\n\nGrossman supported this statement with a copy of the EEOC's\r\n\ncharge transmittal form for Osinubi's charge, dated 12/29/93\r\n\nand addressed to the MCAD.  The form, however, was not signed\r\n\nby an officer of the MCAD indicating the MCAD's receipt.  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Grossman  attached  to her  affidavit  the following  six\r\nexhibits:   a copy of Osinubi's charge,  her notes of a phone\r\nconversation   with  Green's  attorney,   the  EEOC's  charge\r\ntransmittal form addressed to  the MCAD for Osinubi's charge,\r\nthe  EEOC-MCAD Worksharing  Agreement,  letters from  Green's\r\nattorney to the  EEOC investigator, and the EEOC's  letter of\r\ndetermination. \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          On March 13, 1995, Green moved to strike the charge\r\n\ntransmittal form and that portion of Grossman's Affidavit\r\n\nregarding the EEOC's forwarding of Osinubi's charge.  Green\r\n\ncontended that the charge transmittal form was\r\n\nunauthenticated, did not prove filing with and receipt by the\r\n\nMCAD, and that Grossman has no personal knowledge of the\r\n\nEEOC's forwarding of Osinubi's charge to the MCAD.\r\n\n          On March 23, 1995, the EEOC filed its Opposition to\r\n\nthe Motion to Strike.  The EEOC responded that Grossman could\r\n\nattest to routine EEOC procedures and thereby authenticate\r\n\nthe charge transmittal form and that Osinubi's charge was\r\n\nconstructively filed with the MCAD when the EEOC forwarded it\r\n\nto the MCAD on December 29, 1993.  In the alternative, the\r\n\nEEOC argued that even if the MCAD's receipt of Osinubi's\r\n\ncharge was required to initiate MCAD proceedings, it could\r\n\nverify such receipt with the attached affidavit of Walter W.\r\n\nHoran, the EEOC Program Coordinator for the MCAD.  In his\r\n\nattached affidavit, Horan stated that he was the MCAD's\r\n\ncustodian of records of EEOC charges forwarded to the MCAD\r\n\nand that MCAD records indicated that the MCAD received a copy\r\n\nof Osinubi's charge on January 6, 1994.  Horan attached to\r\n\nhis affidavit a signed copy of the charge transmittal form\r\n\nacknowledging the MCAD's receipt of Osinubi's charge.  \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nC.  District Court Opinion\r                                      \r\n\n          On March 29, 1995, the district court issued its\r\n\nopinion resolving the Motion to Dismiss and the Motion to\r\n\nStrike.  The court began its opinion by noting that because\r\n\nmatters outside the pleadings were presented, it was\r\n\nconverting Green's motion to dismiss for failure to state a\r\n\nclaim to a motion for summary judgment.  The district court\r\n\nhad not previously notified the parties of its intention to\r\n\nconvert.  The court then explained that to qualify for the\r\n\nextended limitations period, Osinubi or the EEOC on Osinubi's\r\n\nbehalf must have initially filed charges with the MCAD.  The\r\n\ncourt found, however, that neither Osinubi nor the EEOC had\r\n\ndone so.  With respect to Osinubi, the court viewed her\r\n\nfailure to check the box on the EEOC charge form as evincing\r\n\na preference not to have her charge filed with the MCAD.\r\n\n          The EEOC, the court found, had also failed to file\r\n\nOsinubi's charge with the MCAD.  The court assumed arguendo\r                                                                       \r\n\nthat Grossman's contested attestation that the EEOC had\r\n\nforwarded Osinubi's charge to the MCAD was admissible.  The\r\n\ncourt held, however, that merely forwarding the charge to the\r\n\nMCAD was not sufficient to initiate MCAD proceedings and\r\n\nthereby trigger the extended limitations period; proof that\r\n\nthe MCAD actually received the forwarded charge also was\r\n\nnecessary.  \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          Despite Horan's verification of the MCAD's receipt\r\n\nof Osinubi's charge, the district court found that the EEOC\r\n\nhad not contested Brayton's assertion that the MCAD had no\r\n\nrecord of receiving Osinubi's charge.  Accepting this\r\n\n\"uncontested\" fact as true, the court reasoned as follows: \r\n\nbecause the MCAD never received a copy of Osinubi's charge, a\r\n\nprecondition to invoking the 300-day extended limitations\r\n\nperiod had not been satisfied; thus, the general 180-day\r\n\nlimitations period applied, and the EEOC's complaint was\r\n\ntime-barred.  The district court made no mention of the Horan\r\n\nAffidavit and did not explain the reason for its failure to\r\n\nconsider it.  \r\n\n            Finally, the district court dismissed the EEOC's\r\n\nargument that paragraph II.A. of the EEOC-MCAD Worksharing\r\n\nAgreement (\"[the MCAD] designates [the EEOC] as its agent for\r\n\nthe purpose of receiving charges\") allows MCAD proceedings to\r\n\nbe initiated upon the EEOC's receipt of a charge and without\r                                        \r\n\nadditional notice to the MCAD.

Mass. 1986), the court\r                    \r\n\nheld that filing with the state agency is a precondition to\r\n\ninvoking the extended limitations period and that to allow\r\n\notherwise, e.g., by way of worksharing agreement, would be\r\n\ninconsistent with the scheme Congress established.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n                             II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          On appeal, the EEOC argues that the district court\r\n\nerred in granting summary judgment because:  (1) in paragraph\r\n\nII.A. of the EEOC-MCAD Worksharing Agreement, the MCAD\r\n\ndesignated the EEOC as its agent for receiving charges and\r\n\ntherefore MCAD proceedings were initiated when the EEOC\r\n\nreceived Osinubi's charge, thereby qualifying Osinubi for the\r\n\nextended limitations period and (2) even if actual receipt by\r\n\nthe MCAD was required to commence MCAD proceedings, the Horan\r\n\nAffidavit provided ample evidence that the MCAD received\r\n\nOsinubi's charge to contradict the Brayton Affidavit and\r\n\ncreate a genuine issue of material fact.  \r\n\n          Because we find the EEOC's second argument\r\n\ndispositive, we do not consider its first claim except to\r\n\noffer the following observation from our examination of the\r\n\nEEOC-MCAD Worksharing Agreement.  While Title VII4 and the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Title  VII encourages  cooperation between  the EEOC  and\r\nstate and local agencies  and authorizes the formalization of\r\nsuch  cooperative  efforts in  written  agreements.   Section\r\n705(g)(1)  empowers the  EEOC  \"to cooperate  with and,  with\r\ntheir consent,  utilize  regional, State,  local,  and  other\r\nagencies.\"    42  U.S.C.    2000e-4(g)(1).    Section  709(b)\r\nprovides that \"[i]n furtherance of such cooperative  efforts,\r\nthe Commission  may enter  into written agreements  with such\r\nState  or  local agencies.\"   42  U.S.C.    2000e-8(b).   The\r\nSupreme Court has interpreted these sections to \"envision the\r\nestablishment of  some sort of worksharing agreements between\r\nthe  EEOC  and  state  and  local  agencies\"  and  to  permit\r\nprovisions within  these worksharing agreements  \"designed to\r\navoid unnecessary  duplication of  effort or waste  of time.\"\r\nEEOC  v.

The  EEOC  and  the MCAD  would  be  wise  to revise  the\r\nlanguage  of  their Worksharing  Agreement  to clarify  their\r\nintent.   Rather  than explicitly  providing that  the EEOC's\r\nreceipt  of  charges  on  the MCAD's  behalf  initiates  MCAD\r\nproceedings  for  purposes  of  section  706(e)(1), paragraph\r\nII.A.  states that  the EEOC  will be  the MCAD's  \"agent for\r\npurposes  of receipt.\"   That  phrase, however,  supports two\r\nreadings:  that the EEOC will act as the MCAD's mailbox, date\r\nstamping  and accepting mail on the MCAD's behalf or that the\r\nEEOC's receipt  of a charge also  initiates MCAD proceedings.\r\nThe  EEOC  and the  MCAD  should  also address  the  apparent\r\nambiguity arising from the Worksharing Agreement's failure to\r\ndefine terms such as \"appropriate charges\" in paragraph II.D.\r\nand  to  distinguish  the  \"advance  waivers\"  of   paragraph\r\nIII.E.11. from the other waivers of paragraph III.E.1-10.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n          After reciting the standard of review, we turn our\r\n\nattention to the EEOC's second argument.

Accordingly,\r\n\nbecause the record before the district court posed a genuine\r\n\nissue of material fact, summary judgment could have been\r\n\ngranted for Green only if the district court acted within the\r\n\nsphere of its discretion in failing to consider the Horan\r\n\nAffidavit.  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  Because the  EEOC does  not contest the  district court's\r\nruling that forwarding a charge to the MCAD is not sufficient\r\nto  initiate MCAD  proceedings,  we need  not decide  whether\r\nanything less  than the  MCAD's receipt, such  as the  EEOC's\r\nmere forwarding, initiates MCAD proceedings.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          Ordinarily, the district court has broad authority\r\n\nto prescribe the evidentiary materials it will consider in\r\n\ndeciding a motion for summary judgment.

We are\r                           \r\n\nreluctant to second-guess the district court in this area and\r\n\nreview such decisions only for a clear abuse of discretion. \r\n\nSee </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541731\"><a href=\"/opinion/541731/united-states-v-parcels-of-land-etc-appeal-of-lionel-laliberte/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 45. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">Nonetheless, we conclude that on the very\r                   \r\n\nunusual circumstances of this case, the district court\r\n\noverstepped its authority and abused its discretion in\r\n\nfailing to consider the Horan Affidavit.\r\n\n          The unusual circumstances that motivate this\r\n\ndecision include:  (1) the district court's failure to notify\r\n\nthe parties of its intention to convert Green's Motion to\r\n\nDismiss into a motion for summary judgment, (2) the EEOC's\r\n\nattachment of the Horan Affidavit to a filing that was\r\n\ndirectly related to the Motion to Dismiss, and (3) the\r\n\nprejudice to the EEOC from the court's failure to give notice\r\n\nof its intention to convert.  We discuss each in turn.\r\n\n          Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) has been interpreted to\r\n\nrequire the district court to expressly notify the parties of\r\n\nits intention to convert.  See Chaparro-Febus v.\r                                                         \r\n\nInternational Longshoremen Ass'n, Local 1575, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r                                                        \r\n\n332 (1st Cir. 1992).

The\r\n\nOpposition to the Motion to Strike, however, was directly\r\n\nrelated to the Motion to Dismiss; the district court had to\r\n\nresolve the Motion to Strike in order to determine which\r\n\naffidavits were properly before it on summary judgment.  As\r\n\nsuch, the Opposition to the Motion to Strike was a filing to\r\n\nwhich a party reasonably might attach evidentiary materials\r\n\nopposing the Motion to Dismiss.8  Having failed to notify\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  In  its  Opposition to  the  Motion to  Strike,  the EEOC\r\nargued that should the  court grant the Motion to  Strike the\r\nGrossman  Affidavit, it  should consider  the  attached Horan\r\nAffidavit  in its place.  While it would have been preferable\r\nfor  the EEOC  to  have attached  the  Horan Affidavit  to  a\r\nseparate  motion   requesting  the  court   to  consider  the\r\naffidavit as newly submitted evidence, the Horan Affidavit is\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nthe parties of its intention to convert, the district court\r\n\nat a minimum should have considered a filing like the Horan\r\n\nAffidavit that had reasonably been attached to an opposition\r\n\nthat was directly related to the Motion to Dismiss.9  \r\n\n          Had the district court followed the prescribed\r\n\napproach of Rule 12(b) and notified the parties of its intent\r\n\nto convert, the EEOC would almost certainly have had the\r\n\nopportunity to ensure that the district court consider the\r\n\nHoran Affidavit.  When a court informs the parties of its\r\n\nintention to convert, ordinarily it provides the parties with\r\n\na minimum of ten days, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), in\r\n\nwhich to augment previous filings.  Had the district court so\r\n\nnotified the parties in the instant case, the EEOC could have\r\n\nresubmitted the Horan Affidavit, attached to an opposition to\r\n\nthe converted motion for summary judgment, and thereby\r\n\nguaranteed its consideration.10  Similarly, had the\r\n\ndistrict court specified which submissions it would consider\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nsufficiently  related  to  the  Motion to  Strike,  that  its\r\nattachment  to  the Opposition  to  the Motion  to  Strike is\r\nreasonable.  \r\n\n9.  In  so holding, we do  not require the  district court to\r\nscour ancillary  filings for hidden  and potentially relevant\r\naffidavits.   A  court need  only refer  to those  filings in\r\nwhich a  party reasonably might include  materials in support\r\nof or in opposition to the motion to dismiss.\r\n\n10.  Local  Rule  56.1  of  the  District   of  Massachusetts\r\nrequires a  district court to consider  evidentiary materials\r\nfiled as exhibits to the opposition to the motion for summary\r\njudgment.  \r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nin making its summary judgment decision, the EEOC could have\r\n\nfiled the Horan Affidavit in compliance therewith.  \r\n\n          As it turned out, however, the district court's\r\n\nfailure to notify the parties of its intention to convert\r\n\nleft the parties in the dark.  Under this unique set of\r\n\ncircumstances, where the district court's failure to notify\r\n\nthe parties of its intention to convert was prejudicial and\r\n\nthe Horan Affidavit was attached to a filing directly related\r\n\nto the Motion to Dismiss, the district court's failure to\r\n\nconsider the Horan Affidavit was an abuse of discretion.  \r\n\n                             III.\r                                             \r\n\n                          CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          Because we find that the Horan and Brayton\r\n\nAffidavits presented the district court with a genuine issue\r\n\nof material fact, we vacate the district court's order\r                                       \r\n\ngranting summary judgment for Green and remand for further\r                                                          \r\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n</pre>",
