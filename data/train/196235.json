GIBSON,  Senior Circuit Judge.\r                                                         \r\n\nInsurance  Company appeals  from  the  district court's  judgment\r\n\ndenying its counterclaims against Command Transportation, Inc. to\r\n\nrecover  freight damage claims Liberty paid to Command's shippers\r\n\nand to collect insurance  premiums from Command.  Liberty  argues\r\n\nthat the district court erred:  (1) in failing to reduce  freight\r\n\ndamage  claims Liberty paid  Command's shipping customers  by the\r\n\namounts the  shippers owed Command  for freight services;  (2) in\r\n\ndenying  its motions  to substitute or  add the  Resolution Trust\r\n\nCorporation  as  a  defendant or  third-party  defendant;  (3) in\r\n\ndenying  relief on  Liberty's breach  of  contract claim  against\r\n\nCommand  for  unpaid insurance  premiums;  and (4)  in  ruling on\r\n\nissues of disputed material fact.  We affirm the district court's\r\n\njudgment.\r\n\n          It  is unnecessary  that we  detail  the complex  facts\r\n\nunderlying the  relatively simple  issues in this  appeal.   This\r\n\nlitigation began  when Command,  an interstate  trucking company,\r\n\nbecame  insolvent and attempted  to collect freight  charges from\r\n\nits  shippers,  including  B.J.'s  Wholesale  Club, Inc.;  Lionel\r\n\nLeisure,  Inc.; Morse  Shoe, Inc.;  and  Ames Department  Stores.\r\n\nThese  shippers filed  counterclaims against Command  for freight\r\n\ndamage and losses.\r\n\n          In  1980, Command  had purchased  a  Motor Truck  Cargo\r\n\nPolicy from Liberty.  As required by the Interstate Commerce Act,\r\n\nthe policy contained an endorsement for cargo liability, commonly\r\n\nreferred  to  as  a  \"BMC-32 endorsement.\"    49  U.S.C.    10927\r\n\n(a)(3)(1988).   Under the BMC-32 endorsement Liberty was required\r\r\n\n to pay directly  any freight damage claims  of Command's shippers\r\n\nfor  which Command  may have  been liable.   Further,  the BMC-32\r\n\nendorsement provided, in part:\r\n\n            The insured agrees to reimburse [Liberty]\r\n            for  any  payment  made  by [Liberty]  on\r\n            account of any loss or damage involving a\r\n            breach of the terms of the policy and for\r\n            any payment that [Liberty] would not have\r\n            been   obligated   to  make   under   the\r\n            provisions of the  policy, except for the\r\n            agreement contained in  this endorsement.\r\n\nThe policy terminated on  October 1, 1988, and was  replaced by a\r\n\nsimilar policy  issued by Home  Insurance Company.   Command sued\r\n\nLiberty and Home for breaching the insurance contract  by failing\r\n\nto  pay  shippers directly  for  their lost  or  damaged freight.\r\n\nAlthough  Liberty admittedly received the freight claims (and, in\r\n\nfact,  paid  some),  Liberty  argued  that  it  was  entitled  to\r\n\nCommand's accounts receivable from the shippers.  Liberty alleged\r\n\nthat a surety relationship existed between Command and Liberty by\r\n\nvirtue of Liberty's payment of  freight damage claims directly to\r\n\nthe  shippers under  the BMC-32  endorsement.   As  surety of  an\r\n\ninsolvent  principal, Liberty  contended that  it  could set  off\r\n\nCommand's freight  charge claims against  Liberty's obligation to\r\n\npay the shippers' freight damage claims.\r\n\n          In  1986, Command  entered  into  a  revolving  finance\r\n\nagreement with Comfed Savings Bank.  The agreement granted Comfed\r\n\na security  interest in  certain of  Command's assets,  including\r\n\nCommand's accounts receivable.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n           By April 1989, Command was insolvent.  Command sold its\r\n\nassets to Munson Transportation and paid the proceeds  to Comfed.\r\n\nIn December  1990, the RTC  was named as conservator  for Comfed,\r\n\nand, in September 1991, the  RTC was appointed receiver.  Liberty\r\n\nclaimed that the RTC was the real party in interest which must be\r\n\nsubstituted for Command or added as a third-party defendant.\r\n\n          During  the  litigation,   the  district  court  denied\r\n\nLiberty's motions to substitute the RTC for Command or to add the\r\n\nRTC  as a  third-party defendant.   The court  rejected Liberty's\r\n\narguments that  the RTC,  through Comfed, was  the real  party in\r\n\ninterest.\r\n\n          Ultimately, the parties  resolved all their  respective\r\n\nclaims, except  for Liberty's counterclaims  against Command  for\r\n\nsetoff and for breach of contract.\r\n\n          The  district court  ordered that  Command  and Liberty\r\n\nfile an agreed stipulation of facts.  The parties could not agree\r\n\nto a joint stipulation of facts, so each party submitted its  own\r\n\nproposed  stipulation of facts.   The proposed  stipulations were\r\n\nalmost identical except  each party included some  facts that the\r\n\nother party either disagreed with or did not address.\r\n\n          After  a hearing on March  28, 1994, the district court\r\n\ndenied Liberty's counterclaims.   Command Transportation Inc.  v.\r                                                                           \r\n\nB.J's Wholesale Club, Inc., Civ.  No. 90-10188-G, slip op. at 16-\r                                    \r\n\n17 (D. Mass. June 23, 1994).   The court determined that the BMC-\r\n\n32 endorsement  obligated Liberty  to pay  shippers directly  for\r\n\nfreight  damage and  loss.   The court  ruled that  although this\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n obligation  may  supersede  other  provisions  of  the  insurance\r\n\npolicy, \"the endorsement must be read in conjunction with, not in\r\n\nlieu of, the policy.\"  Id. at 9.  The court based this ruling  on\r                                    \r\n\nthe endorsement,  which stated:   \"[A]ll  terms, conditions,  and\r\n\nlimitations in the policy  to which this endorsement is  attached\r\n\nare to remain in  full force and  effect.\"  After discussing  two\r\n\ncases  considering earlier versions of the BMC-32 endorsement, In\r                                                                           \r\n\nre  Yale Express Sys.,  Inc., 362  F.2d 111  (2d Cir.  1966), and\r                                      \r\n\nEmpire Fire  &amp; Marine Ins.  Co. v. J.  Transport, Inc., 880  F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n1291  (11th  Cir.  1989),  the  court  distinguished  obligations\r\n\narising   from  the  policy  and  obligations  arising  from  the\r\n\nendorsement.  The court concluded that Liberty could be a surety,\r\n\nentitled  to a  setoff  only  for payments  it  made to  shippers\r\n\n\"solely\" under  the endorsement, and that Liberty failed to prove\r\n\nthat it made  payments solely under the endorsement.  Slip op. at\r\n\n13.   The court  determined that Liberty  failed to  classify its\r\n\npayments to shippers as an  obligation from the endorsement or as\r\n\nan  obligation from  the  policy.   The  court  pointed out  that\r\n\nLiberty omitted the cargo policy as an exhibit to the Stipulation\r\n\nof Facts, and attached only a one-page form:  \"Motor Truck Policy\r\n\n- Gross Receipts,\"  which did not explain Liberty's obligation to\r\n\npay claims  under the policy.  Id.   The court ruled that Liberty\r                                            \r\n\nwas not entitled to set  off freight damage claims with Command's\r\n\naccounts receivable.   The court acknowledged that  Liberty could\r\n\nhave  a valid  setoff  claim  \"to the  extent  that its  payments\r\n\nrepresent deductibles  it would  not have  been obligated  to pay\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n under the policy.\"   Id. at 14.   Once again, however,  the court\r                                  \r\n\nconcluded  that Liberty failed to prove  entitlement to a setoff.\r\n\nThe court referred to an affidavit submitted by Liberty, to which\r\n\nCommand  did not stipulate,  listing Liberty's total  payments to\r\n\neach  shipper.   Id.   Because  the affidavit  showed only  total\r                              \r\n\npayments,  the court  could  neither  determine  if  Liberty  had\r\n\nalready reduced the  amount by the deductible, nor  calculate the\r\n\ndate,  amount,  or number  of  losses.   Accordingly,  the  court\r\n\nconcluded that  there was  no basis for  ruling that  Liberty was\r\n\nentitled to a setoff for the deductible amount.  Id. at 14-15.\r                                                              \r\n\n          Liberty also  claimed subrogation  rights arising  from\r\n\nindemnity agreements  between  it and  Command,  whereby  Command\r\n\nagreed to  indemnify Liberty  for any monies  paid by  Liberty in\r\n\nconnection  with  \"bonds,  undertakings  and/or  obligations   of\r\n\nsuretyship or guarantee\"  issued on behalf  of Command.   Because\r\n\nLiberty's recovery  under this  provision depended  on proving  a\r\n\nsurety relationship, the court did not address Liberty's claim of\r\n\nsubrogation.   Id. at  15.   The court  explained that a  further\r                            \r\n\nobstacle to  Liberty's claims  existed because  a non-party,  the\r\n\nRTC,  held a secured  interest in Command's  accounts receivable.\r\n\nId. at 16.\r             \r\n\n          Finally,  the court held  that Liberty failed  to prove\r\n\nits breach of contract claim.   Id.  The court reasoned that  the\r                                             \r\n\nsole  item  of  evidence,  a  September 20,  1989,  Statement  of\r\n\nAccount, did not  prove that Command owed Liberty  premiums under\r\n\nthe policy that lapsed in 1988.  Without the terms of the policy,\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n including proof of coverage dates, the court refused to speculate\r\n\nwhether Command had failed to pay premiums due.  Id. at 17.\r                                                              \r\n\n          Liberty filed a motion to amend judgment.  At a hearing\r\n\non a different  motion, Liberty's counsel stated that  he did not\r\n\nexpect the  court to  enter judgment on  the basis  of stipulated\r\n\nfacts  but thought there  would be a  trial.  The  district court\r\n\njudge  found this statement inconsistent with his recollection of\r\n\nthe  March 28, 1994  proceedings when Liberty's  counsel remained\r\n\nsilent after Command's  counsel stated he  expected the court  to\r\n\nenter judgment on the basis of  the stipulated record.  The court\r\n\nconstrued Liberty's silence as assent.  The district court denied\r\n\nLiberty's motion, and Liberty appeals.\r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n          In its reply  brief, Liberty contends that  the parties\r\n\ndid not authorize the district court  to decide disputed material\r\n\nfacts.   Liberty  asserts that  although  the parties  wanted the\r\n\ndistrict court to decide the  case based on stipulated facts, the\r\n\nparties  did not  agree to  stipulated facts.   Arguing  that the\r\n\nstandard  governing the  granting of  a  summary judgment  motion\r\n\napplies, Liberty contends that the district court erred by ruling\r\n\non material issues of genuine fact without a trial.\r\n\n          Liberty  agreed,  however,  for the  district  court to\r\n\ndecide the case  on the record before it.  The first paragraph in\r\n\nLiberty's memorandum submitted  to the district court  in support\r\n\nof judgment in its favor states:\r\n\n            The  following  memorandum  is  submitted\r\n            pursuant   to   the   agreement   between\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n             [Command]   and   [Liberty]    that   all\r\n            remaining issues in this  case be decided\r\n            by the Court based  upon a Stipulation of\r\n            Facts.     No  final  agreement   on  the\r\n            Stipulation of Facts  was reached by  the\r\n            deadline  imposed by  the  Court, so  the\r\n            references in this  memorandum are to the\r\n            \"Stipulation of  Facts\" filed  by Liberty\r\n            on  March 23, 1994.   Liberty also relies\r\n            on its previous briefs filed with respect\r\n            to this matter.\r\n\n          The  record of the March 28 proceedings also shows that\r\n\nLiberty expected the court to decide the case based on the record\r\n\nbefore  it.   At the  hearing,  the district  court judge  asked:\r\n\n\"What are  we doing here  this afternoon?\"  The  judge questioned\r\n\nwhether  the proceedings were pretrial, cross motions for summary\r\n\njudgment, or trial of the case.  Command's counsel responded that\r\n\nthe court directed  the parties to submit a  stipulation of facts\r\n\nand brief the issue of liability on Liberty's counterclaims.  The\r\n\ncourt  then  explained that  it  was  unsure  where to  turn  for\r\n\nevidence of  the payments, receipts  and dates, and asked  if the\r\n\nsubmitted  filings identified the amounts that Liberty, or anyone\r\n\nelse,  paid  the  shippers.    Command's  counsel  answered  that\r\n\nLiberty's  affidavit showed  the amounts  Liberty  paid and  that\r\n\nCommand  did   not  intend  to   submit  further   documentation.\r\n\nLiberty's  counsel agreed that  he addressed every  issue Command\r\n\nraised in  its briefs.   After discussing  the merits  of various\r\n\nissues,  the  court  asked  Liberty's  counsel  what  he  sought.\r\n\nLiberty answered:  \"any monies which went to Command or may go to\r\n\nCommand in the  future which were subject to  the shipper's right\r\n\nto setoff.\"\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n           Furthermore,  the  district   court's  June  23,  1994,\r\n\ndecision made twenty-three findings of fact, incorporating all of\r\n\nthe stipulations of  facts submitted by Liberty in  its March 24,\r\n\n1994  filing,  except  for  Liberty's proposed  stipulation  that\r\n\nCommand had not paid certain premiums due.  Liberty's argument in\r\n\nthis appeal does  not identify a disputed issue  of material fact\r\n\nit  claims to  be wrongly  decided by  the district  court.1   We\r\n\ntherefore reject Liberty's argument that the district court erred\r\n\nby deciding this  case and, indeed, are left  with the impression\r\n\nthat Liberty has been less than candid in urging this position.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n          Liberty  argues that the  BMC-32 endorsement  created a\r\n\nsurety relationship  between Liberty  and Command,  and that  the\r\n\ndistrict court's finding  of no suretyship is  clearly erroneous.\r\n\nLiberty contends that,  as Command's  surety, it  is entitled  to\r\n\nassert the shippers' right to set off unpaid freight charges.\r\n\n          The  case  law  unequivocally  supports  the   district\r\n\ncourt's view that  the mere existence  of the BMC-32  endorsement\r\n\ndoes not give rise to  a surety relationship entitling Liberty to\r\n\nset  off  its  obligation  to  pay  freight  damage  claims.    A\r\n\nsuretyship  is created  only after  the insurer  makes  a payment\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1    Having  failed to  identify  any  material  factual dispute,\r\nLiberty's  arguments that the  district court should  have viewed\r\nthe proceedings as cross-motions for summary  judgment and held a\r\ntrial on  the merits  are contradictory.

That\r                                                    \r\n\nendorsement  required the carrier  to reimburse the  insurer \"for\r\n\nany payment that  the [insurer] would not have  been obligated to\r\n\nmake under the provisions of the policy, except for the agreement\r\n\ncontained  in the endorsement.\"   Id. at 113.   After the carrier\r                                               \r\n\nwent bankrupt, the shippers asserted  claims for lost and damaged\r\n\nfreight.   Id.    The carrier  and  insurer asserted  conflicting\r                        \r\n\npositions.   The  carrier  demanded that  the  shippers  pay  all\r\n\nfreight charges  to it.  Id.  The  insurer asserted that it could\r                                      \r\n\nset off freight damage  claims with the carrier's claims  against\r\n\nthe shippers for  unpaid freight.  Id.   The Second  Circuit held\r                                                \r\n\nthat the insurer was a surety only for the claims it  paid solely\r\n\nunder the endorsement, not to  those claims it paid also required\r\n\nby the policy.  Id. at 114.   The court explained that suretyship\r                             \r\n\nexists when \"'one person has undertaken an obligation and another\r\n\nperson  is also under an obligation or other duty to the obligee,\r\n\nwho is  entitled to but one  performance, and as between  the two\r\n\nwho  are bound, one rather than  the other should perform.'\"  Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\n(quoting  Restatement  of  Security    82  (1941)).    The  court\r\n\nreasoned  that,  although  the  insurer  and  carrier  were  both\r\n\nobligated  to the shipper, the carrier's promise to reimburse the\r\n\ninsurer for any payments made solely by virtue of the endorsement\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n made  the carrier,  not the  insurer, the  principal who  \"should\r\n\nperform.\"  Id.   The court distinguished claims  that the insurer\r                        \r\n\npaid  under  the  endorsement exceeding  the  deductible:   \"[the\r\n\ninsurer's] position under the endorsement differs wholly from its\r\n\nstatus with respect to  claims exceeding [the deductible]; as  to\r\n\nthe latter it is an  indemnitor,\" not a surety.  Id. at  114 n.1.\r                                                              \r\n\nBecause the deductible is an  amount which the insurer would \"not\r\n\notherwise be  obligated to pay\"  except for the  endorsement, the\r\n\ninsurer had surety status only for the deductible amount.  Id.\r                                                                        \r\n\n          The Eleventh Circuit rejected the very argument Liberty\r\n\nmakes here  in Empire Fire  &amp; Marine, 880  F.2d 1291.   The court\r                                              \r\n\nremanded that case,  in part, for a determination  of whether the\r\n\ninsurance  policy  covered the  loss  at  issue.

Liberty\r\n\ncontends that  Command did  not allege  that Liberty's  liability\r\n\narose from anything other  than the endorsement.  Liberty  points\r\n\nout  that, when it  was called on  to directly pay  the shippers,\r\n\nCommand  had already  cancelled and  replaced  the cargo  policy.\r\n\nThus, Liberty contends that the district court erred in requiring\r\n\nproof that  Liberty had no  obligation to pay the  shippers under\r\n\nthe policy.  \r\n\n          Liberty's argument is circular.   The endorsement, just\r\n\nas in Yale Express and  Empire Fire &amp; Marine, specifically limits\r                                                      \r\n\nLiberty's right to reimbursement from Command to payments Liberty\r\n\nwould  not have  been  obligated  to pay  under  the policy,  and\r\n\nLiberty  bore  the  burden  of  proving  entitlement  to  setoff.\r\n\nReliance Steel Prod.

The district court noted that\r\n\nthe \"only policy before the Court is the Motor Truck Policy . . .\r\n\nissued on November 1, 1980 and numbered K01-712-001357-04.\"  Slip\r\n\nop. at  16-17.  The district  court found that the  only evidence\r\n\noffered by Liberty to support its breach of contract  claim was a\r\n\nSeptember 20,  1989, Statement  of  Account.   Id.  at 16.    The\r                                                            \r\n\nStatement of Account listed several policy numbers,  and the only\r\n\npolicy number in the two-page statement which corresponded to the\r\n\npolicy number on the face of the policy differed by one digit and\r\n\nlisted  a \"Retro  Adjustment\" in  the  amount of  $186,159.   The\r\n\ndistrict  court concluded  that the  evidence did  not show  that\r\n\nCommand   continues  to  owe  premiums  under  the  policy  which\r\n\nterminated in 1988,  only that Liberty made  a \"retro adjustment\"\r\n\nto that policy.\r\n\n          During  the hearing,  the district court  asked counsel\r\n\nwhich  page  of  the  policy  defined  \"premiums owed  under  the\r\n\npolicy.\"   Liberty's  counsel remained  silent  when counsel  for\r\n\nCommand stated that \"it's  not [Command's] burden\" but  \"if there\r\n\nis an  answer to that question I would  guess it would be located\r\n\nin the policy.\"\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n           On  appeal,  Liberty  explains   only  that  a   \"retro\r\n\nadjustment is  an increased premium  owed by an insured  based on\r\n\nthe cost to the insurer as shown by actual experience,\"  and that\r\n\nthe \"retro adjustment amounts listed on the  Statement of Account\r\n\nare  'Payable on  Receipt.'\"   Liberty  explains  that the  total\r\n\nretroadjustments  reflected in the  Statement of Account  are all\r\n\npremiums  for policies  that are  part of  the cargo  policy and,\r\n\ntherefore, Liberty  should be awarded  $444,262 on its  breach of\r\n\ncontract claim.   The shortfall of Liberty's  contentions is that\r\n\nit has  presented no  evidence to explain  how it  calculated the\r\n\n\"retro  adjustment\" or why Command still  owes premiums under the\r\n\n1988 insurance policy.2   Therefore, the  district court did  not\r\n\nerr in concluding that there was insufficient evidence to support\r\n\nLiberty's breach of insurance contract claim.\r\n\n                               IV.\r                                         IV.\r\n\n          Finally,  Liberty   alleges  numerous  errors   in  the\r\n\ndistrict court's refusal to substitute  the RTC as the real party\r\n\nin interest or to  add the RTC as  a party under Fed. R.  Civ. P.\r\n\n17(a), 19, and 20.  Liberty alleges that Comfed, and subsequently\r\n\nthe  RTC, is the real  party in interest.   Liberty also contends\r\n\nthat  the RTC,  acting through  the corporate  shell  of Command,\r\n\nattempts,  through this litigation,  to force Liberty  to pay the\r\n\nshippers' claims  so that the  RTC may collect the  full accounts\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  Liberty's citation to Truck Ins.

In\r              \r\nthat case,  the parties  did not dispute  the computation  of the\r\ntotal  amount  of  premiums payable,  and  the  insurer presented\r\ntestimony as to the premium computation.

Liberty  contends  that  the  RTC's  collection  without\r\n\naffording notice or  the opportunity to be heard deprived Liberty\r\n\nof  its  property  in  violation  of  the  Fifth  and  Fourteenth\r\n\nAmendments to the United States Constitution.\r\n\n          Because Liberty failed to prove entitlement to a setoff\r\n\nagainst  Command's bankruptcy  estate, Liberty's efforts  to make\r\n\nthe RTC a party necessarily fail.  In any event, we are persuaded\r\n\nthat  a  number of  other  reasons support  the  district court's\r\n\nrefusal to substitute or add the RTC as a party or  a third-party\r\n\ndefendant, including Liberty's failure to exhaust  administrative\r\n\nremedies, see,  e.g., Marquis v.

This litigation began when Command, an interstate trucking company, became insolvent and attempted to collect freight charges from its shippers, including B.J.'s Wholesale Club, Inc.;   Lionel Leisure, Inc.;   Morse Shoe, Inc.;   and Ames Department Stores.

As required by the Interstate Commerce Act, the policy contained an endorsement for cargo liability, commonly referred to as a \"BMC  -32 endorsement.\"  49 U.S.C. Sec. 10927(a)(3)(1988).  Under the BMC-32 endorsement Liberty was required to pay directly any freight damage claims of Command's shippers for which Command may have been liable.  Further, the BMC-32 endorsement provided, in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>The insured agrees to reimburse [Liberty] for any payment made by [Liberty] on account of any loss or damage involving a breach of the terms of the policy and for any payment that [Liberty] would not have been obligated to make under the provisions of the policy, except for the agreement contained in this endorsement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy terminated on October 1, 1988, and was replaced by a similar policy issued by Home Insurance Company.  Command sued Liberty and Home for breaching the insurance contract by failing to pay shippers directly for their lost or damaged freight.  Although Liberty admittedly received the freight claims (and, in fact, paid some), Liberty argued that it was entitled to Command's accounts receivable from the shippers.  Liberty alleged that a surety relationship existed between Command and Liberty by virtue of Liberty's payment of freight damage claims directly to the shippers under the BMC-32 endorsement.  As surety of an insolvent principal, Liberty contended that it could set off Command's freight charge claims against Liberty's obligation to pay the shippers' freight damage claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1986, Command entered into a revolving finance agreement with Comfed Savings Bank.  The agreement granted Comfed a security interest in certain of Command's assets, including Command's accounts receivable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By April 1989, Command was insolvent.  Command sold its assets to Munson Transportation and paid the proceeds to Comfed.  In December 1990, the RTC was named as conservator for Comfed, and, in September 1991, the RTC was appointed receiver.  Liberty claimed that the RTC was the real party in interest which must be substituted for Command or added as a third-party defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the litigation, the district court denied Liberty's motions to substitute the RTC for Command or to add the RTC as a third-party defendant.  The court rejected Liberty's arguments that the RTC, through Comfed, was the real party in interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, the parties resolved all their respective claims, except for Liberty's counterclaims against Command for setoff and for breach of contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ordered that Command and Liberty file an agreed stipulation of facts.  The parties could not agree to a joint stipulation of facts, so each party submitted its own proposed stipulation of facts.  The proposed stipulations were almost identical except each party included some facts that the other party either disagreed with or did not address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a hearing on March 28, 1994, the district court denied Liberty's counterclaims.  Command Transportation Inc. v. B.J.'s Wholesale Club, Inc., 864 F.Supp. 226, 232 (D.Mass.1994).  The court determined that the BMC-32 endorsement obligated Liberty to pay shippers directly for freight damage and loss.  The court ruled that although this obligation may supersede other provisions of the insurance policy, \"the endorsement must be read in conjunction with, not in lieu of, the policy.\"  Id. at 229.   The court based this ruling on the endorsement, which stated:  \"[A]ll terms, conditions, and limitations in the policy to which this endorsement is attached are to remain in full force and effect.\"   After discussing two cases considering earlier versions of the BMC-32 endorsement, In re Yale Express Sys., Inc., 362 F.2d 111 (2d Cir.1966), and Empire Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. J. Transport, Inc., 880 F.2d 1291 (11th Cir.1989), the court distinguished obligations arising from the policy and obligations arising from the endorsement.  The court concluded that Liberty could be a surety, entitled to a setoff only for payments it made to shippers \"solely\" under the endorsement, and that Liberty failed to prove that it made payments solely under the endorsement. 864 F.Supp. at 231.   The court determined that Liberty failed to classify its payments to shippers as an obligation from the endorsement or as an obligation from the policy.  The court pointed out that Liberty omitted the cargo policy as an exhibit to the Stipulation of Facts, and attached only a one-page form:  \"Motor Truck Policy--Gross Receipts,\" which did not explain Liberty's obligation to pay claims under the policy.  Id.  The court ruled that Liberty was not entitled to set off freight damage claims with Command's accounts receivable.  The court acknowledged that Liberty could have a valid setoff claim \"to the extent that its payments represent deductibles it would not have been obligated to pay under the policy.\"  Id. at 231.   Once again, however, the court concluded that Liberty failed to prove entitlement to a setoff.  The court referred to an affidavit submitted by Liberty, to which Command did not stipulate, listing Liberty's total payments to each shipper.  Id.  Because the affidavit showed only total payments, the court could neither determine if Liberty had already reduced the amount by the deductible, nor calculate the date, amount, or number of losses.  Accordingly, the court concluded that there was no basis for ruling that Liberty was entitled to a setoff for the deductible amount.  Id. at 231-32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty also claimed subrogation rights arising from indemnity agreements between it and Command, whereby Command agreed to indemnify Liberty for any monies paid by Liberty in connection with \"bonds, undertakings and/or obligations of suretyship or guarantee\" issued on behalf of Command.  Because Liberty's recovery under this provision depended on proving a surety relationship, the court did not address Liberty's claim of subrogation.  Id. at 232.   The court explained that a further obstacle to Liberty's claims existed because a non-party, the RTC, held a secured interest in Command's accounts receivable.  Id. at 232.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the court held that Liberty failed to prove its breach of contract claim.  Id.  The court reasoned that the sole item of evidence, a September 20, 1989, Statement of Account, did not prove that Command owed Liberty premiums under the policy that lapsed in 1988.  Without the terms of the policy, including proof of coverage dates, the court refused to speculate whether Command had failed to pay premiums due.  Id. at 232.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty filed a motion to amend judgment.  At a hearing on a different motion, Liberty's counsel stated that he did not expect the court to enter judgment on the basis of stipulated facts but thought there would be a trial.  The district court judge found this statement inconsistent with his recollection of the March 28, 1994 proceedings when Liberty's counsel remained silent after Command's counsel stated he expected the court to enter judgment on the basis of the stipulated record.  The court construed Liberty's silence as assent.  The district court denied Liberty's motion, and Liberty appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its reply brief, Liberty contends that the parties did not authorize the district court to decide disputed material facts.  Liberty asserts that although the parties wanted the district court to decide the case based on stipulated facts, the parties did not agree to stipulated facts.  Arguing that the standard governing the granting of a summary judgment motion applies, Liberty contends that the district court erred by ruling on material issues of genuine fact without a trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty agreed, however, for the district court to decide the case on the record before it.  The first paragraph in Liberty's memorandum submitted to the district court in support of judgment in its favor states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>The following memorandum is submitted pursuant to the agreement between [Command] and [Liberty] that all remaining issues in this case be decided by the Court based upon a Stipulation of Facts.  No final agreement on the Stipulation of Facts was reached by the deadline imposed by the Court, so the references in this memorandum are to the \"Stipulation of Facts\" filed by Liberty on March 23, 1994.  Liberty also relies on its previous briefs filed with respect to this matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record of the March 28 proceedings also shows that Liberty expected the court to decide the case based on the record before it. At the hearing, the district court judge asked:  \"What are we doing here this afternoon?\"   The judge questioned whether the proceedings were pretrial, cross motions for summary judgment, or trial of the case.  Command's counsel responded that the court directed the parties to submit a stipulation of facts and brief the issue of liability on Liberty's counterclaims.  The court then explained that it was unsure where to turn for evidence of the payments, receipts and dates, and asked if the submitted filings identified the amounts that Liberty, or anyone else, paid the shippers.  Command's counsel answered that Liberty's affidavit showed the amounts Liberty paid and that Command did not intend to submit further documentation.  Liberty's counsel agreed that he addressed every issue Command raised in its briefs.  After discussing the merits of various issues, the court asked Liberty's counsel what he sought.  Liberty answered:  \"any monies which went to Command or may go to Command in the future which were subject to the shipper's right to setoff.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the district court's June 23, 1994, decision made twenty-three findings of fact, incorporating all of the stipulations of facts submitted by Liberty in its March 24, 1994 filing, except for Liberty's proposed stipulation that Command had not paid certain premiums due.  Liberty's argument in this appeal does not identify a disputed issue of material fact it claims to be wrongly decided by the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We therefore reject Liberty's argument that the district court erred by deciding this case and, indeed, are left with the impression that Liberty has been less than candid in urging this position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty argues that the BMC-32 endorsement created a surety relationship between Liberty and Command, and that the district court's finding of no suretyship is clearly erroneous.  Liberty contends that, as Command's surety, it is entitled to assert the shippers' right to set off unpaid freight charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law unequivocally supports the district court's view that the mere existence of the BMC-32 endorsement does not give rise to a surety relationship entitling Liberty to set off its obligation to pay freight damage claims.  A suretyship is created only after the insurer makes a payment required solely under the endorsement, in other words, a payment the insurer \"would not have been obligated to make under the provisions of the policy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second Circuit considered an earlier version of the BMC-32 endorsement in In re Yale Express, 362 F.2d 111.   That endorsement required the carrier to reimburse the insurer \"for any payment that the [insurer] would not have been obligated to make under the provisions of the policy, except for the agreement contained in the endorsement.\"  Id. at 113.   After the carrier went bankrupt, the shippers asserted claims for lost and damaged freight.  Id.  The carrier and insurer asserted conflicting positions.  The carrier demanded that the shippers pay all freight charges to it.  Id.  The insurer asserted that it could set off freight damage claims with the carrier's claims against the shippers for unpaid freight.  Id.  The Second Circuit held that the insurer was a surety only for the claims it paid solely under the endorsement, not to those claims it paid also required by the policy.  Id. at 114.   The court explained that suretyship exists when \" 'one person has undertaken an obligation and another person is also under an obligation or other duty to the obligee, who is entitled to but one performance, and as between the two who are bound, one rather than the other should perform.' \"  Id. (quoting Restatement of Security Sec. 82 (1941)).  The court reasoned that, although the insurer and carrier were both obligated to the shipper, the carrier's promise to reimburse the insurer for any payments made solely by virtue of the endorsement made the carrier, not the insurer, the principal who \"should perform.\"  Id.  The court distinguished claims that the insurer paid under the endorsement exceeding the deductible:  \"[the insurer's] position under the endorsement differs wholly from its status with respect to claims exceeding [the deductible];  as to the latter it is an indemnitor,\" not a surety.  Id. at 114 n. 1.   Because the deductible is an amount which the insurer would \"not otherwise be obligated to pay\" except for the endorsement, the insurer had surety status only for the deductible amount.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Circuit rejected the very argument Liberty makes here in Empire Fire &amp; Marine, 880 F.2d 1291.   The court remanded that case, in part, for a determination of whether the insurance policy covered the loss at issue.  Id. at 1298.   Likewise, in American Inter-Fidelity Exch. v. American Re-Insurance Co., 17 F.3d 1018 (7th Cir.1994), the Seventh Circuit interpreted language virtually identical to the BMC-32 endorsement, concluding that an insurer is a surety only for the deductible under the endorsement, the amount it would not have been obligated to pay under the policy.  Id. at 1022.   Accord Ford Motor Co. v. Transport Indem. Co., 41 B.R. 433, 439 (E.D.Mich.1984), rev'd on other grounds, 795 F.2d 538 (6th Cir.1986).  Cf. Eastern Freight Ways, Inc. v. Seaboard Surety Co., 577 F.2d 175, 180 n. 9 (2d Cir.1978) (surety relationship established because of issuance of bonds for cargo claims).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Liberty may be a surety only to the extent its payments to shippers represent payments required \"solely\" under the endorsement, we have no difficulty rejecting Liberty's argument that the district court erred in requiring it to distinguish between policy and endorsement obligations.  Liberty contends that Command did not allege that Liberty's liability arose from anything other than the endorsement.  Liberty points out that, when it was called on to directly pay the shippers, Command had already cancelled and replaced the cargo policy.  Thus, Liberty contends that the district court erred in requiring proof that Liberty had no obligation to pay the shippers under the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty's argument is circular.  The endorsement, just as in Yale Express and Empire Fire &amp; Marine, specifically limits Liberty's right to reimbursement from Command to payments Liberty would not have been obligated to pay under the policy, and Liberty bore the burden of proving entitlement to setoff.  Reliance Steel Prod.  Co. v. National Fire Ins. Co., 880 F.2d 575, 577-78 (1st Cir.1989).  Liberty neglected to specify whether its payments to shippers were also obliged under the policy.  See In re Yale Express, 362 F.2d at 114 n. 1 (insurer not a surety for amounts in excess of deductible under endorsement);  American Inter-Fidelity Exch., 17 F.3d at 1022 (insurer is a surety only for deductible under endorsement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We similarly reject Liberty's argument that suretyship and insurance cannot co-exist and that, therefore, its right to setoff is not subject to the insurance provisions of the cargo policy.  This argument is inconsistent with the cases interpreting the BMC-32 endorsement and irreconcilable with the language of the endorsement providing that \"all terms, conditions, and limitations in the policy ... remain in full force and effect.\"   See Empire Fire &amp; Marine, 880 F.2d at 1298 (regulations which require the endorsement \"do not alter or affect the obligations between the insured and the insurer\");  American Inter-Fidelity Exch., 17 F.3d at 1022 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty next argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that the evidence was insufficient to prove Liberty's counterclaim for premiums owed by Command under the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty sought $656,330.04 in premiums allegedly owed by Command under the cargo policy.  The district court noted that the \"only policy before the Court is the Motor Truck Policy ... issued on November 1, 1980 and numbered K01-712-001357-04.\"  864 F.Supp. at 232.   The district court found that the only evidence offered by Liberty to support its breach of contract claim was a September 20, 1989, Statement of Account.  Id. at 232.   The Statement of Account listed several policy numbers, and the only policy number in the two-page statement which corresponded to the policy number on the face of the policy differed by one digit and listed a \"Retro Adjustment\" in the amount of $186,159.  The district court concluded that the evidence did not show that Command continues to owe premiums under the policy which terminated in 1988, only that Liberty made a \"retro adjustment\" to that policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the hearing, the district court asked counsel which page of the policy defined \"premiums owed under the policy.\"   Liberty's counsel remained silent when counsel for Command stated that \"it's not [Command's] burden\" but \"if there is an answer to that question I would guess it would be located in the policy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Liberty explains only that a \"retro adjustment is an increased premium owed by an insured based on the cost to the insurer as shown by actual experience,\" and that the \"retro adjustment amounts listed on the Statement of Account are 'Payable on Receipt.' \"   Liberty explains that the total retroadjustments reflected in the Statement of Account are all premiums for policies that are part of the cargo policy and, therefore, Liberty should be awarded $444,262 on its breach of contract claim.  The shortfall of Liberty's contentions is that it has presented no evidence to explain how it calculated the \"retro adjustment\" or why Command still owes premiums under the 1988 insurance policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Therefore, the district court did not err in concluding that there was insufficient evidence to support Liberty's breach of insurance contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Liberty alleges numerous errors in the district court's refusal to substitute the RTC as the real party in interest or to add the RTC as a party under Fed.R.Civ.P. 17(a), 19, and 20.  Liberty alleges that Comfed, and subsequently the RTC, is the real party in interest.  Liberty also contends that the RTC, acting through the corporate shell of Command, attempts, through this litigation, to force Liberty to pay the shippers' claims so that the RTC may collect the full accounts receivable due from the shippers free from Liberty's right to set off.  Liberty contends that the RTC's collection without affording notice or the opportunity to be heard deprived Liberty of its property in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Liberty failed to prove entitlement to a setoff against Command's bankruptcy estate, Liberty's efforts to make the RTC a party necessarily fail.  In any event, we are persuaded that a number of other reasons support the district court's refusal to substitute or add the RTC as a party or a third-party defendant, including Liberty's failure to exhaust administrative remedies, see, e.g., Marquis v. FDIC, 965 F.2d 1148, 1151 (1st Cir.1992), or to explain the superiority of its alleged interest.  See In re Yale Express, 362 F.2d at 117.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Having failed to identify any material factual dispute, Liberty's arguments that the district court should have viewed the proceedings as cross-motions for summary judgment and held a trial on the merits are contradictory.

Liberty argues that the district court erred:  (1) in failing to reduce freight damage claims Liberty paid Command's shipping customers by the amounts the shippers owed Command for freight services;  (2) in denying its motions to substitute or add the Resolution Trust Corporation as a defendant or third-party defendant;  (3) in denying relief on Liberty's breach of contract claim against Command for unpaid insurance premiums;  and (4) in ruling on issues of disputed material fact.  We affirm the district court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unnecessary that we detail the complex facts underlying the relatively simple issues in this appeal.  This litigation began when Command, an interstate trucking company, became insolvent and attempted to collect freight charges from its shippers, including B.J.'s Wholesale Club, Inc.;   Lionel Leisure, Inc.;   Morse Shoe, Inc.;   and Ames Department Stores.  These shippers filed counterclaims against Command for freight damage and losses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1980, Command had purchased a Motor Truck Cargo Policy from Liberty.  As required by the Interstate Commerce Act, the policy contained an endorsement for cargo liability, commonly referred to as a \"BMC  -32 endorsement.\"  49 U.S.C. Sec. 10927(a)(3)(1988).  Under the BMC-32 endorsement Liberty was required to pay directly any freight damage claims of Command's shippers for which Command may have been liable.  Further, the BMC-32 endorsement provided, in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>The insured agrees to reimburse [Liberty] for any payment made by [Liberty] on account of any loss or damage involving a breach of the terms of the policy and for any payment that [Liberty] would not have been obligated to make under the provisions of the policy, except for the agreement contained in this endorsement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy terminated on October 1, 1988, and was replaced by a similar policy issued by Home Insurance Company.  Command sued Liberty and Home for breaching the insurance contract by failing to pay shippers directly for their lost or damaged freight.  Although Liberty admittedly received the freight claims (and, in fact, paid some), Liberty argued that it was entitled to Command's accounts receivable from the shippers.  Liberty alleged that a surety relationship existed between Command and Liberty by virtue of Liberty's payment of freight damage claims directly to the shippers under the BMC-32 endorsement.  As surety of an insolvent principal, Liberty contended that it could set off Command's freight charge claims against Liberty's obligation to pay the shippers' freight damage claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1986, Command entered into a revolving finance agreement with Comfed Savings Bank.

Command sold its assets to Munson Transportation and paid the proceeds to Comfed.  In December 1990, the RTC was named as conservator for Comfed, and, in September 1991, the RTC was appointed receiver.  Liberty claimed that the RTC was the real party in interest which must be substituted for Command or added as a third-party defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the litigation, the district court denied Liberty's motions to substitute the RTC for Command or to add the RTC as a third-party defendant.  The court rejected Liberty's arguments that the RTC, through Comfed, was the real party in interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, the parties resolved all their respective claims, except for Liberty's counterclaims against Command for setoff and for breach of contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ordered that Command and Liberty file an agreed stipulation of facts.

The court ruled that although this obligation may supersede other provisions of the insurance policy, \"the endorsement must be read in conjunction with, not in lieu of, the policy.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 229. </span>  The court based this ruling on the endorsement, which stated:  \"[A]ll terms, conditions, and limitations in the policy to which this endorsement is attached are to remain in full force and effect.\"   After discussing two cases considering earlier versions of the BMC-32 endorsement, In re Yale Express Sys., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"272146\"><a href=\"/opinion/272146/in-the-matter-of-yale-express-system-inc-debtor-boston-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span> </a></span>(2d Cir.1966), and Empire Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

The court concluded that Liberty could be a surety, entitled to a setoff only for payments it made to shippers \"solely\" under the endorsement, and that Liberty failed to prove that it made payments solely under the <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">endorsement.</span> <span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">231</span></span>.   The court determined that Liberty failed to classify its payments to shippers as an obligation from the endorsement or as an obligation from the policy.  The court pointed out that Liberty omitted the cargo policy as an exhibit to the Stipulation of Facts, and attached only a one-page form:  \"Motor Truck Policy--Gross Receipts,\" which did not explain Liberty's obligation to pay claims under the policy.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  The court </span>ruled that Liberty was not entitled to set off freight damage claims with Command's accounts receivable.  The court acknowledged that Liberty could have a valid setoff claim \"to the extent that its payments represent deductibles it would not have been obligated to pay under the policy.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 231. </span>  Once again, however, the court concluded that Liberty failed to prove entitlement to a setoff.  The court referred to an affidavit submitted by Liberty, to which Command did not stipulate, listing Liberty's total payments to each shipper.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  Because the </span>affidavit showed only total payments, the court could neither determine if Liberty had already reduced the amount by the deductible, nor calculate the date, amount, or number of losses.  Accordingly, the court concluded that there was no basis for ruling that Liberty was entitled to a setoff for the deductible amount.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 231-32.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty also claimed subrogation rights arising from indemnity agreements between it and Command, whereby Command agreed to indemnify Liberty for any monies paid by Liberty in connection with \"bonds, undertakings and/or obligations of suretyship or guarantee\" issued on behalf of Command.  Because Liberty's recovery under this provision depended on proving a surety relationship, the court did not address Liberty's claim of subrogation.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 232. </span>  The court explained that a further obstacle to Liberty's claims existed because a non-party, the RTC, held a secured interest in Command's accounts receivable.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 232.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the court held that Liberty failed to prove its breach of contract claim.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  The court </span>reasoned that the sole item of evidence, a September 20, 1989, Statement of Account, did not prove that Command owed Liberty premiums under the policy that lapsed in 1988.  Without the terms of the policy, including proof of coverage dates, the court refused to speculate whether Command had failed to pay premiums due.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 232.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty filed a motion to amend judgment.  At a hearing on a different motion, Liberty's counsel stated that he did not expect the court to enter judgment on the basis of stipulated facts but thought there would be a trial.  The district court judge found this statement inconsistent with his recollection of the March 28, 1994 proceedings when Liberty's counsel remained silent after Command's counsel stated he expected the court to enter judgment on the basis of the stipulated record.  The court construed Liberty's silence as assent.  The district court denied Liberty's motion, and Liberty appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its reply brief, Liberty contends that the parties did not authorize the district court to decide disputed material facts.  Liberty asserts that although the parties wanted the district court to decide the case based on stipulated facts, the parties did not agree to stipulated facts.  Arguing that the standard governing the granting of a summary judgment motion applies, Liberty contends that the district court erred by ruling on material issues of genuine fact without a trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty agreed, however, for the district court to decide the case on the record before it.  The first paragraph in Liberty's memorandum submitted to the district court in support of judgment in its favor states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>The following memorandum is submitted pursuant to the agreement between [Command] and [Liberty] that all remaining issues in this case be decided by the Court based upon a Stipulation of Facts.  No final agreement on the Stipulation of Facts was reached by the deadline imposed by the Court, so the references in this memorandum are to the \"Stipulation of Facts\" filed by Liberty on March 23, 1994.  Liberty also relies on its previous briefs filed with respect to this matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record of the March 28 proceedings also shows that Liberty expected the court to decide the case based on the record before it. At the hearing, the district court judge asked:  \"What are we doing here this afternoon?\"   The judge questioned whether the proceedings were pretrial, cross motions for summary judgment, or trial of the case.  Command's counsel responded that the court directed the parties to submit a stipulation of facts and brief the issue of liability on Liberty's counterclaims.  The court then explained that it was unsure where to turn for evidence of the payments, receipts and dates, and asked if the submitted filings identified the amounts that Liberty, or anyone else, paid the shippers.  Command's counsel answered that Liberty's affidavit showed the amounts Liberty paid and that Command did not intend to submit further documentation.  Liberty's counsel agreed that he addressed every issue Command raised in its briefs.  After discussing the merits of various issues, the court asked Liberty's counsel what he sought.  Liberty answered:  \"any monies which went to Command or may go to Command in the future which were subject to the shipper's right to setoff.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the district court's June 23, 1994, decision made twenty-three findings of fact, incorporating all of the stipulations of facts submitted by Liberty in its March 24, 1994 filing, except for Liberty's proposed stipulation that Command had not paid certain premiums due.  Liberty's argument in this appeal does not identify a disputed issue of material fact it claims to be wrongly decided by the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We therefore reject Liberty's argument that the district court erred by deciding this case and, indeed, are left with the impression that Liberty has been less than candid in urging this position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty argues that the BMC-32 endorsement created a surety relationship between Liberty and Command, and that the district court's finding of no suretyship is clearly erroneous.  Liberty contends that, as Command's surety, it is entitled to assert the shippers' right to set off unpaid freight charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law unequivocally supports the district court's view that the mere existence of the BMC-32 endorsement does not give rise to a surety relationship entitling Liberty to set off its obligation to pay freight damage claims.  A suretyship is created only after the insurer makes a payment required solely under the endorsement, in other words, a payment the insurer \"would not have been obligated to make under the provisions of the policy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second Circuit considered an earlier version of the BMC-32 endorsement in In re Yale Express, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"272146\"><a href=\"/opinion/272146/in-the-matter-of-yale-express-system-inc-debtor-boston-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span>.

The court reasoned that, although the insurer and carrier were both obligated to the shipper, the carrier's promise to reimburse the insurer for any payments made solely by virtue of the endorsement made the carrier, not the insurer, the principal who \"should perform.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  The court </span>distinguished claims that the insurer paid under the endorsement exceeding the deductible:  \"[the insurer's] position under the endorsement differs wholly from its status with respect to claims exceeding [the deductible];  as to the latter it is an indemnitor,\" not a surety.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"272146\"><a href=\"/opinion/272146/in-the-matter-of-yale-express-system-inc-debtor-boston-insurance/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 114 </a></span>n. 1.

Liberty contends that Command did not allege that Liberty's liability arose from anything other than the endorsement.  Liberty points out that, when it was called on to directly pay the shippers, Command had already cancelled and replaced the cargo policy.  Thus, Liberty contends that the district court erred in requiring proof that Liberty had no obligation to pay the shippers under the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty's argument is circular.

The district court found that the only evidence offered by Liberty to support its breach of contract claim was a September 20, 1989, Statement of Account.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 232. </span>  The Statement of Account listed several policy numbers, and the only policy number in the two-page statement which corresponded to the policy number on the face of the policy differed by one digit and listed a \"Retro Adjustment\" in the amount of $186,159.  The district court concluded that the evidence did not show that Command continues to owe premiums under the policy which terminated in 1988, only that Liberty made a \"retro adjustment\" to that policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the hearing, the district court asked counsel which page of the policy defined \"premiums owed under the policy.\"   Liberty's counsel remained silent when counsel for Command stated that \"it's not [Command's] burden\" but \"if there is an answer to that question I would guess it would be located in the policy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Liberty explains only that a \"retro adjustment is an increased premium owed by an insured based on the cost to the insurer as shown by actual experience,\" and that the \"retro adjustment amounts listed on the Statement of Account are 'Payable on Receipt.' \"   Liberty explains that the total retroadjustments reflected in the Statement of Account are all premiums for policies that are part of the cargo policy and, therefore, Liberty should be awarded $444,262 on its breach of contract claim.  The shortfall of Liberty's contentions is that it has presented no evidence to explain how it calculated the \"retro adjustment\" or why Command still owes premiums under the 1988 insurance policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Therefore, the district court did not err in concluding that there was insufficient evidence to support Liberty's breach of insurance contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Liberty alleges numerous errors in the district court's refusal to substitute the RTC as the real party in interest or to add the RTC as a party under Fed.R.Civ.P. 17(a), 19, and 20.  Liberty alleges that Comfed, and subsequently the RTC, is the real party in interest.  Liberty also contends that the RTC, acting through the corporate shell of Command, attempts, through this litigation, to force Liberty to pay the shippers' claims so that the RTC may collect the full accounts receivable due from the shippers free from Liberty's right to set off.  Liberty contends that the RTC's collection without affording notice or the opportunity to be heard deprived Liberty of its property in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Liberty failed to prove entitlement to a setoff against Command's bankruptcy estate, Liberty's efforts to make the RTC a party necessarily fail.  In any event, we are persuaded that a number of other reasons support the district court's refusal to substitute or add the RTC as a party or a third-party defendant, including Liberty's failure to exhaust administrative remedies, see, e.g., Marquis v.
