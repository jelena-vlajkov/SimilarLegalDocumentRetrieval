(National), on her claims of slander and\n\nviolating  the Massachusetts  Civil  Rights Act.   Lyons  had\n\nfiled a  nine count complaint  in the district  court against\n\nNational after  her termination.   Six counts  were dismissed\n\npretrial  on a motion for  summary judgment.1   No appeal was\n\ntaken  from the  summary judgment  dismissal.   The remaining\n\nthree counts,  which included a count  by plaintiff's husband\n\nfor loss of consortium, were tried  before a jury.  The trial\n\nwas  bifurcated.   After  plaintiff rested  on her  liability\n\ncounts, defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law under\n\nFed.  R. Civ.  P. 50.   After  briefing and  argument by  the\n\nparties, the court entered judgment for defendant as a matter\n\nof law.\n\n          Plaintiff filed a timely appeal which included  the\n\nloss of consortium count.   The issues on appeal  are whether\n\neither  or  both of  the  liability counts  should  have been\n\nsubmitted  to  the jury.   Our  standard  of review  has been\n\nstated as follows:\n\n          A  reviewing  court   applies  the   same\n          standard  that  governed adjudication  of\n\n                    \n\n1.

Lyons\n\nworked for National at Logan International Airport in Boston,\n\nMassachusetts.  She began  working for National in 1983  as a\n\nrental representative,  became a customer  service manager in\n\n1985, and was promoted to regional  training manager in 1989.\n\nLyons' immediate supervisor was Ellen Justiniano.\n\n          This action arose from  events that occurred during\n\na training conference held by National at its headquarters in\n\nMinneapolis,  Minnesota, during  the week  of April  8, 1991.\n\nLyons  attended  the  conference  along  with   her  regional\n\ncounterparts.  During the conference, Lyons encountered  some\n\nproblems with her supervisor, Justiniano.  The  first day she\n\narrived  Lyons was  in the  elevator with Justiniano.   Lyons\n\nlooked  at  her  keys  and  remarked,  \"I  am  a  little  bit\n\nconfused.\"  Whereupon Justiniano  responded, \"Well, what else\n\nis new?\"  She was told during one  session by Justiniano that\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nshe was  embarrassing her by  nodding off and to  go into the\n\nbathroom and put on some make-up.  During one of the training\n\nsessions Justiniano slipped her a  note which read, \"Terry, I\n\njust  put you through training.  Why are you embarrassing me?\n\nWhy aren't you answering any questions?\"\n\n          On  Friday,   April  12,   the  last  day   of  the\n\nconference, Justiniano pulled her aside and told her that the\n\ncompany was  investigating  a car  theft from  its office  in\n\nBoston and  Bryan Viau,  National's chief of  security, would\n\nlike to  speak to Lyons to  get some input.   Lyons agreed to\n\nmeet with Viau at his office at ten o'clock.\n\n          After greeting Lyons in  his office, Viau  escorted\n\nher into a very small room.  It had a round table with  a box\n\nof tissues  on it, which  caught her  eye, and chairs  at the\n\ntable two or three feet apart.  One of the chairs was already\n\noccupied  by a woman, Trudie Levesque.  She was there because\n\nof  National's  policy  when  questioning  employees  of  the\n\nopposite sex.  Viau started the interview by asking Lyons how\n\nher  week had been going.  She  responded by starting to cry.\n\nShe told Viau  that she had a  bad week, that  she had a  bad\n\nrelationship  with her boss, and  that her boss  had not been\n\nvery nice to her.\n\n          Lyons then asked  Viau to please tell  her what was\n\ngoing on.  Viau pointed to a folder and said,  \"I have strong\n\nevidence that you were  involved in a company theft.\"   Lyons\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nbecame hysterical and  asked several times  if she could  see\n\nthe evidence.   Viau refused to show her the evidence.  Lyons\n\nthen said, \"Why would  I be crying so hard if I was guilty of\n\ndoing something like that?\"  Viau responded by saying that it\n\nwas people like her who  cry a lot that are the  guilty ones.\n\nHe also said that it was people like her who know the ins and\n\nouts  of the company that do things  such as that.  Viau also\n\ntold her that she had the face of a good liar. Viau continued\n\nto say,  \"Terry, you know, you  know the ins and  outs.  It's\n\npeople like  you.    If you  don't  speak now,  you  will  be\n\nprosecuted.   You will lose  your job.\"   At some  point Viau\n\nleft the  room. When he  came back, Lyons asked  him what was\n\ngoing to happen at this point.  He said, \"You go back to your\n\njob, and when  we have  the evidence we  will prosecute  you.\n\nJust  go back and do your job.\"  Viau also told her that if a\n\ntrial  \"was to  come forward,\"  he would  let her  know. This\n\nended the interview.  During  the interview, Lyons named  her\n\nstepson as the possible  thief because he had a  prior record\n\nof stealing  cars.  She did  this in an attempt  to help Viau\n\nidentify the real thief.\n\n          On  cross-examination  Lyons  said that  she  never\n\nasked to leave  the interrogation room.   She testified  that\n\nViau never touched her  or threatened to touch her,  and that\n\nalthough Viau raised his voice during the interview, he never\n\nshouted.  Based on  facts that were represented to  have been\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nknown by National, Lyons agreed that  National had some basis\n\nfor questioning her.  She further testified on cross that she\n\nhad  the opportunity  to say  anything she  wanted about  the\n\ntheft.\n\n          When  Lyons got into the  van to go  to the airport\n\nfor her trip  home, she  was still visibly  very much  upset.\n\nWhen asked by some of her colleagues what was wrong, she told\n\nthem that she had  been accused of car theft.  After arriving\n\nhome, Lyons  told members of  her family about  the interview\n\nand  accusation of  car  theft.   She  went back  to  work in\n\nNational's Boston office.\n\n          Viau's questioning of Lyons was prompted by a prior\n\ninvestigation  which disclosed  evidence suggesting  that the\n\ntheft  was an inside job  involving someone with  the name of\n\nLyons.  The stolen car was ultimately found in the possession\n\nof a Barbara  Lyons.  The only link between Barbara Lyons and\n\nthe plaintiff  was that, unknown to  plaintiff, Barbara Lyons\n\nwas  having a  relationship with  plaintiff's brother-in-law,\n\nPatrick  Dello  Iacono, who  was  a sergeant  on  the Everett\n\nPolice department.  Viau decided to interview plaintiff after\n\nconsultation  with  her   supervisors,  Foley,  Ceruolo,  and\n\nJustiniano.\n\n                      THE SLANDER COUNT\n                                       \n\n          Because this is a diversity case, Massachusetts law\n\napplies.    We   agree  with  the  district  court  that  the\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nstatement, \"National has strong  evidence you are involved in\n\na car  theft,\" was slanderous.  Galvin v. New York, New Haven\n                                                             \n\nand  Hartford R.R.  Co.,  168 N.E.2d  262,  294 (Mass.  1960)\n                       \n\n(accusations of  crime actionable  without  proof of  special\n\ndamage); Bander v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 47 N.E.2d 595,\n                                             \n\n598 (Mass. 1943) (same).\n\n          The district  court held that the  other statements\n\nmade during the interview were not slanderous:  \"You have the\n\nface  of a good  liar\"; \"It's people like  [you] who cry that\n\nare  the guilty ones\"; \"It's  people like [you]  who know the\n\nins and  outs of the  company that  do things such  as that\";\n\n\"Terry, you know, you know the ins and outs. It's people like\n\nyou\"; and \"If you don't speak now, you will be prosecuted.\"\n\n          We do  not think that these  statements should have\n\nbeen  excised  from the  accusation of  car  theft.   All the\n\nstatements  made  by  Viau  were  part  and  parcel  of  that\n\naccusation.   This is  not a  situation where  statements are\n\nmade  at different  times  and in  different  contexts.   The\n\nstatements were made during  one interview.  National accused\n\nplaintiff of car theft,  and because she denied it,  said she\n\nwas a  liar.   Part of  the theft accusation  was that  as an\n\nemployee  of  National,  she  had the  knowledge  of  company\n\npractice and the opportunity  to commit the theft.   She also\n\nwas told that  if she did not confess to  the theft she would\n\nbe prosecuted.  The statements, taken as a whole, constituted\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\na single accusation that  Lyons had stolen a company  car and\n\nan attempt by National to have her confess to the accusation.\n\n          Defendant  argues that  because  plaintiff did  not\n\nspecifically object to the district court rulings finding the\n\nstatements not slanderous during the Rule 50 hearings, she is\n\nprecluded from raising the issue here.   There is no merit to\n\nthis contention.   The  plaintiff argued that  the statements\n\nwere slanderous during the Rule 50 hearing.  Tr., 2d day, pp.\n\n95-97.   And  she also  argues  to  the same  effect  in  her\n\nappellate  brief.    Plaintiff's  Brief  at  13.    This  was\n\nsufficient to preserve  the issue  for review.   There is  no\n\nrequirement that specific objections  to the court's  rulings\n\nbe  made during  a Rule  50 hearing.    It suffices  that the\n\nplaintiff raise the issues so that the court understands what\n\nthey are.  This was clearly done here.  The  requirement that\n\nspecific objections  be made to the  introduction of evidence\n\nor to the court's  final charge to the jury do  not, contrary\n\nto defendant's suggestion, apply to a Rule 50 hearing.\n\n          Although   defendant   has  not   argued   lack  of\n\npublication on appeal, the  district court did express doubts\n\nabout publication during the Rule 50 hearing.  We simply note\n\nthat the  publication requirement for a  slander action under\n\nMassachusetts law  was met here.   Brauer v.  Globe Newspaper\n                                                             \n\nCo., 217 N.E.2d 736, 739 (Mass. 1966):\n   \n\n          There is no  requirement in an  action of\n          libel  \"that  the  defamatory  matter  be\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\n          communicated   to   a   large   or   even\n          substantial  group  of  persons.

The  presence of  the third\n\nperson in the  interrogation room was sufficient to  meet the\n\npublication requirement.  \n\n          We now  turn to  the related issues  of conditional\n\nprivilege  and malice.  We agree with the district court that\n\nthe facts giving rise to a conditional privilege  by National\n\nwere  proven  during plaintiff's  case-in-chief.   National's\n\nprior investigation had disclosed that  a person by the  name\n\nof Lyons was probably  involved in the  car theft.  Prior  to\n\nthe  interrogation  of  plaintiff,   Viau  had  grounds   for\n\nsuspecting that the theft  was an inside job.   And plaintiff\n\nherself stated that  National had some basis  to question her\n\nabout the car theft.\n\n          Massachusetts courts have recognized that\n          a  person  may   possess  a   conditional\n          privilege to  publish defamatory material\n          if   the    publication   is   reasonably\n          necessary    to    the   protection    or\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\n          furtherance  of   a  legitimate  business\n          interest.\n\nBratt  v.

New England  Tel. and Tel.\n                                                             \n\nCo., 471 N.E.2d 47, 51 (Mass. 1984).\n   \n\n          The  basic  issue  is  whether  National  lost  its\n\nconditional  privilege by abusing it.  We rule that under the\n\nlaw and  the facts  this was  a jury question.   In  Foley v.\n                                                          \n\nPolaroid  Corp.,  508 N.E.2d  72  (Mass.  1987), the  Supreme\n               \n\nJudicial  Court   reiterated  the  test  for   abuse  of  the\n\nprivilege:\n\n          [w]hen as here, executives of a corporate\n          employer make statements  that defame  an\n          employee,  and the  information disclosed\n          by those statements is reasonably related\n          to  the  employer's  legitimate  business\n          interests, the employee has the burden to\n          prove  that  the  statements   were  made\n          recklessly,  that  is,  that   they  were\n          unnecessary, unreasonable, or excessively\n          published.  Of  course, a statement  made\n          with  knowledge of  its  falsity or  with\n          reckless disregard for the truth would be\n          reckless within the meaning of the rule.\n\nId. at 79-80 (citations omitted).  \n   \n\n          A finding of recklessness is necessary  to overcome\n\na  conditional privilege.  In  Bratt, 467 N.E.2d  at 131, the\n                                    \n\ncourt pointed out  that proof  of \"actual malice\"  was not  a\n\nprerequisite  to the  loss  of the  privilege.   Id.  (citing\n                                                    \n\nGalvin, 168  N.E.2d  at 266).    The court  then  went on  to\n      \n\nexplain  that  Massachusetts  law  favored  \"recklessness\" or\n\n\"malice in fact\"  as the standard.  Id.   It defined one type\n                                       \n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nof  \"malice in fact\" as  \"'the willful doing  of an injurious\n\nact  without lawful  excuse.'\"   Id.,  n.9 (quoting  Doane v.\n                                                          \n\nGrew, 107 N.E. 620, 621 (Mass. 1915)).  The court concluded,\n    \n\n          that  loss  of a  defendant's conditional\n          privilege in a defamation  action through\n          \"unnecessary,  unreasonable or  excessive\n          publication\"  requires   proof  that  the\n          defendant acted recklessly.\n\nId. at 132.\n   \n\n          We   think  that  a   factfinder  could  reasonably\n\nconclude that the statements made during the interrogation of\n\nplaintiff were reckless.  Plaintiff was told at the outset by\n\nViau:   \"I have strong evidence  that you were involved  in a\n\ncompany  theft.\"    Viau  pointed  to  a  folder  during  the\n\naccusation;  this implied  that it  contained such  evidence.\n\nBut the evidence was not  disclosed to plaintiff, despite her\n\nrequest to  see it.  In fact,  there was no \"strong evidence\"\n\nthat plaintiff had  been involved  in a company  theft.   All\n\nthat National had  at that  time was, at  best, a  reasonable\n\nsuspicion.   Plaintiff was then  called a liar  and told that\n\nbecause  of her position in the company she had the knowledge\n\nto  commit  the   theft.    She  was  then   threatened  with\n\nprosecution and loss of her job if she did not confess to the\n\ntheft.  These statements considered as a whole could be found\n\nto be \"reckless\" under Massachusetts law.\n\n          We  also   think  that  \"malice   in  fact\"   could\n\nlegitimately be found.  First, there was evidence  from which\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\na  jury  could find  that  plaintiff's  immediate supervisor,\n\nJustiniano,  either  disliked  plaintiff  personally  or  was\n\ndispleased with her conduct  at the meeting.  But  of telling\n\nsignificance was the conduct of the interrogation.  In  fact,\n\nit was not an interrogation  but an inquisition.  Accusations\n\nand  threats were made; there was no attempt to determine the\n\nfacts objectively.  The manner in which the interrogation was\n\nconducted  fairly reeked  of malice.  It could  reasonably be\n\nfound that the accusations and threats made to plaintiff were\n\n\"the  willful  doing  of  an  injurious  act  without  lawful\n\nexcuse.\"  Bratt, 467 N.E.2d at 131, n.9.\n               \n\n          The judgment  of the district court  on the slander\n\ncount  is  reversed.   The  determination was  for  the jury.\n\nBecause  the loss of consortium count rises or falls with the\n\nslander count, it also remains viable.\n\n                        THE MCRA COUNT\n                                      \n\n          Plaintiff's next argument on appeal arises from the\n\ndistrict court's granting  of National's motion  for judgment\n\nas  a matter  of law  on her  Massachusetts Civil  Rights Act\n\n[MCRA] claim.   Plaintiff claimed that  National, through its\n\nemployee  Viau,  violated  the  MCRA  by  using  threats  and\n\nintimidation  in an  attempt to cause  her to  relinquish her\n\nFifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.   See Mass.\n                                                       \n\nGen. Laws ch.  12   11I.  No claim  was asserted against Viau\n\nindividually.  \n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\n          The MCRA states, in pertinent part:\n\n          Any person whose exercise or enjoyment of\n          rights  secured  by  the constitution  or\n          laws of the United States  . . . has been\n          interfered  with,  or  attempted   to  be\n          interfered   with   [by  any   person  or\n          persons,  whether  or  not  acting  under\n          color of law, by threats, intimidation or\n          coercion,] may institute and prosecute in\n          his  own name  and  on his  own behalf  a\n          civil action for . . . money damages. . .\n          .  \n\nId.     11H,  11I.   The  district court  granted  National's\n   \n\nmotion, finding  first that the MCRA did not recognize claims\n\nbased on the doctrine of respondeat superior, and second that\n\nplaintiff presented not a \"scintilla\" of evidence that Viau's\n\nactions  were   taken  pursuant  to  any   policy  or  custom\n\nestablished by National.  Plaintiff challenges on appeal only\n\nthe first finding.  Assuming,    without    deciding,    that\n\nplaintiff  would have had an actionable MCRA claim if she had\n\nnamed Viau as a defendant, we turn to the respondeat superior\n\nissue.    \n\n          The  question of  whether an  employer may  be held\n\nvicariously  liable  under the  MCRA for  the actions  of its\n\nemployee has  not been  addressed by any  Massachusetts state\n\ncourt.   See, e.g.,  Rodriques v.  Furtado, 575  N.E.2d 1124,\n                                          \n\n1131 n.14  (Mass. 1991) (expressly declining  to decide issue\n\nwith respect to municipal  employer); cf., e.g., O'Connell v.\n                                                          \n\nChasdi, 511 N.E.2d 349, 354 (Mass. 1987) (remanding for trial\n      \n\nMCRA  claim asserted  against  private employer  for acts  of\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nemployer's  agent,  without   questioning  applicability   of\n\nrespondeat superior).  Similarly,  we have never had occasion\n\nto  answer this  question.    See,  e.g.,  Dean  v.  City  of\n                                                             \n\nWorcester, 924  F.2d 364, 370 n.7 (1st  Cir. 1991) (declining\n         \n\nto comment on issue with respect to municipal employer).  The\n\nonly  courts that  have addressed  the issue  have determined\n\nthat claims under the MCRA cannot be based on the doctrine of\n\nrespondeat superior.  E.g., Broderick v. Roache, 803 F. Supp.\n                                               \n\n480, 484  (D. Mass. 1992) (municipal employer); Jones v.

Mass. 1990)  (private\n         \n\nemployer). \n\n          \"Absent  controlling  state   court  precedent,   a\n\nfederal court sitting  in diversity may  certify a state  law\n\nissue  to  the  state's   highest  court,  or  undertake  its\n\nprediction, `when  the [route] [the] state  courts would take\n\nis reasonably clear.'\"   Vanhaaren v.

Co., 989 F.2d  1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993)  (citation omitted).\n        \n\nBecause we  find sufficient guidance on this issue, we follow\n\nthe latter course.\n\n          The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court  [SJC] has\n\nclearly described the scope of the MCRA:\n\n          The  Legislature  enacted  [the MCRA]  to\n          provide a State  remedy for  deprivations\n          of  civil rights.   The  statute extended\n          beyond   the   limits   of  its   Federal\n          counterpart   by  incorporating   private\n          action  within its  bounds.   We conclude\n                                                   \n          that the Legislature intended  to provide\n                                                   \n          a  remedy  under [the  MCRA], coextensive\n                                                   \n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\n          with 42 U.S.C.    1983,  except that  the\n                                \n          Federal  statute  requires  State  action\n          whereas its State counterpart does not.\n\nBatchelder  v.

See  Duarte v.\n                                                          \n\nHealy, 537  N.E.2d 1230, 1232 (Mass. 1989)  (\"We presume that\n     \n\nthe  Legislature was  aware of  this case  law [on  qualified\n\nimmunity] when  it chose  to pattern the  Massachusetts Civil\n\nRights  Act after   1983.\").   Accordingly, we  look to cases\n\nconstruing the federal Civil Rights  Act for guidance in  the\n\npresent action.\n\n          In Monell v.  New York  Dep't of  Soc.

The Court held\n\nthat claims against municipalities cannot rest on a theory of\n\nrespondeat  superior, but may proceed if  there is proof that\n\nthe employee  acted in accordance with  the employer's policy\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nor custom.

In  a concurrence,  Justice Powell\n                \n\nstated  that   Congress's   intent,  as   expressed  in   the\n\nlegislative  history of    1983,  can best  be understood  as\n\nlimiting \"the  statutory ambit to actual  wrongdoers, i.e., a\n                                                          \n\nrejection of  respondeat superior  or any other  principle of\n                                 \n\nvicarious liability.\"  Id. at 707 (Powell, J. concurring).\n                          \n\n          Plaintiff   argues   that  Monell's   rejection  of\n                                           \n\nrespondeat  superior cannot  be grafted  on the  MCRA because\n\nMonell concerns  only municipalities,  while the MCRA  may be\n      \n\ninvoked against private parties.  We  disagree.  Although the\n\nholding in Monell is framed so that it expressly applies only\n                 \n\nto local governments, the decision  is based generally on the\n\nlanguage  and   legislative  history   of     1983,   not  on\n\nprinciples--such   as   sovereign  or   qualified  immunity--\n\napplicable only  to governmental  entities.  See  Monell, 436\n                                                        \n\nU.S. at 690-94.  \n\n          It is  true that one aspect  of Monell's discussion\n                                                \n\nof  the legislative  history of    1983  has no  relevance to\n\nprivate corporations:   certain  members of Congress  opposed\n\nmaking municipalities  vicariously liable on the  ground that\n\nCongress  lacked the  power  to impose  \"positive\" duties  on\n\nlocal governments.   Id. at 679-83, 693.  We  do not believe,\n                        \n\nhowever, that this aspect of the Court's reasoning undermines\n\nour conclusion.  The remainder of Monell focusses  on matters\n                                        \n\npertinent to  all employers,  public or  private.

Id.  at 693-94.   These\n                                         \n\njustifications    are    equally   applicable    to   private\n\ncorporations.\n\n          The  Massachusetts legislature enacted  the MCRA in\n\n1979,  one year  after Monell  was decided.   Presumably, the\n                             \n\nlegislature was aware of Monell.

Gen. Laws  ch. 12,   11H (\"Whenever  any person\n       \n\nor  persons,  whether  or  not  acting  under  color of  law,\n\ninterfere  by threats, intimidation or  coercion . . .\") with\n                                                             \n\n42  U.S.C.   1983 (\"Every  person who, under  color [of law],\n\nsubjects, or  causes to be  subjected, any [other  person] to\n\nthe deprivation of any rights . . .\").  Moreover, it is clear\n\nthat  the  state  legislature   knew  how  to  pass  statutes\n\nembracing the  doctrine of respondeat superior.   E.g., Mass.\n                                                      \n\nGen.

Finally, the  parties have not cited anything  in the\n\nlegislative  history   of  the   MCRA  indicating  that   the\n\nlegislature intended to make employers vicariously liable for\n\nthe  acts  of their  employees.

(National), on her claims of slander and\n\nviolating  the Massachusetts  Civil  Rights Act.   Lyons  had\n\nfiled a  nine count complaint  in the district  court against\n\nNational after  her termination.   Six counts  were dismissed\n\npretrial  on a motion for  summary judgment.1   No appeal was\n\ntaken  from the  summary judgment  dismissal.   The remaining\n\nthree counts,  which included a count  by plaintiff's husband\n\nfor loss of consortium, were tried  before a jury.  The trial\n\nwas  bifurcated.   After  plaintiff rested  on her  liability\n\ncounts, defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law under\n\nFed.  R. Civ.  P. 50.   After  briefing and  argument by  the\n\nparties, the court entered judgment for defendant as a matter\n\nof law.\n\n          Plaintiff filed a timely appeal which included  the\n\nloss of consortium count.   The issues on appeal  are whether\n\neither  or  both of  the  liability counts  should  have been\n\nsubmitted  to  the jury.

Lyons\n\nworked for National at Logan International Airport in Boston,\n\nMassachusetts.  She began  working for National in 1983  as a\n\nrental representative,  became a customer  service manager in\n\n1985, and was promoted to regional  training manager in 1989.\n\nLyons' immediate supervisor was Ellen Justiniano.\n\n          This action arose from  events that occurred during\n\na training conference held by National at its headquarters in\n\nMinneapolis,  Minnesota, during  the week  of April  8, 1991.\n\nLyons  attended  the  conference  along  with   her  regional\n\ncounterparts.  During the conference, Lyons encountered  some\n\nproblems with her supervisor, Justiniano.  The  first day she\n\narrived  Lyons was  in the  elevator with Justiniano.   Lyons\n\nlooked  at  her  keys  and  remarked,  \"I  am  a  little  bit\n\nconfused.\"  Whereupon Justiniano  responded, \"Well, what else\n\nis new?\"  She was told during one  session by Justiniano that\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nshe was  embarrassing her by  nodding off and to  go into the\n\nbathroom and put on some make-up.  During one of the training\n\nsessions Justiniano slipped her a  note which read, \"Terry, I\n\njust  put you through training.  Why are you embarrassing me?\n\nWhy aren't you answering any questions?\"\n\n          On  Friday,   April  12,   the  last  day   of  the\n\nconference, Justiniano pulled her aside and told her that the\n\ncompany was  investigating  a car  theft from  its office  in\n\nBoston and  Bryan Viau,  National's chief of  security, would\n\nlike to  speak to Lyons to  get some input.   Lyons agreed to\n\nmeet with Viau at his office at ten o'clock.\n\n          After greeting Lyons in  his office, Viau  escorted\n\nher into a very small room.  It had a round table with  a box\n\nof tissues  on it, which  caught her  eye, and chairs  at the\n\ntable two or three feet apart.  One of the chairs was already\n\noccupied  by a woman, Trudie Levesque.  She was there because\n\nof  National's  policy  when  questioning  employees  of  the\n\nopposite sex.  Viau started the interview by asking Lyons how\n\nher  week had been going.  She  responded by starting to cry.\n\nShe told Viau  that she had a  bad week, that  she had a  bad\n\nrelationship  with her boss, and  that her boss  had not been\n\nvery nice to her.\n\n          Lyons then asked  Viau to please tell  her what was\n\ngoing on.  Viau pointed to a folder and said,  \"I have strong\n\nevidence that you were  involved in a company theft.\"   Lyons\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nbecame hysterical and  asked several times  if she could  see\n\nthe evidence.   Viau refused to show her the evidence.  Lyons\n\nthen said, \"Why would  I be crying so hard if I was guilty of\n\ndoing something like that?\"  Viau responded by saying that it\n\nwas people like her who  cry a lot that are the  guilty ones.\n\nHe also said that it was people like her who know the ins and\n\nouts  of the company that do things  such as that.  Viau also\n\ntold her that she had the face of a good liar. Viau continued\n\nto say,  \"Terry, you know, you  know the ins and  outs.  It's\n\npeople like  you.    If you  don't  speak now,  you  will  be\n\nprosecuted.   You will lose  your job.\"   At some  point Viau\n\nleft the  room. When he  came back, Lyons asked  him what was\n\ngoing to happen at this point.  He said, \"You go back to your\n\njob, and when  we have  the evidence we  will prosecute  you.\n\nJust  go back and do your job.\"  Viau also told her that if a\n\ntrial  \"was to  come forward,\"  he would  let her  know. This\n\nended the interview.  During  the interview, Lyons named  her\n\nstepson as the possible  thief because he had a  prior record\n\nof stealing  cars.  She did  this in an attempt  to help Viau\n\nidentify the real thief.\n\n          On  cross-examination  Lyons  said that  she  never\n\nasked to leave  the interrogation room.   She testified  that\n\nViau never touched her  or threatened to touch her,  and that\n\nalthough Viau raised his voice during the interview, he never\n\nshouted.  Based on  facts that were represented to  have been\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nknown by National, Lyons agreed that  National had some basis\n\nfor questioning her.  She further testified on cross that she\n\nhad  the opportunity  to say  anything she  wanted about  the\n\ntheft.\n\n          When  Lyons got into the  van to go  to the airport\n\nfor her trip  home, she  was still visibly  very much  upset.\n\nWhen asked by some of her colleagues what was wrong, she told\n\nthem that she had  been accused of car theft.  After arriving\n\nhome, Lyons  told members of  her family about  the interview\n\nand  accusation of  car  theft.   She  went back  to  work in\n\nNational's Boston office.\n\n          Viau's questioning of Lyons was prompted by a prior\n\ninvestigation  which disclosed  evidence suggesting  that the\n\ntheft  was an inside job  involving someone with  the name of\n\nLyons.  The stolen car was ultimately found in the possession\n\nof a Barbara  Lyons.  The only link between Barbara Lyons and\n\nthe plaintiff  was that, unknown to  plaintiff, Barbara Lyons\n\nwas  having a  relationship with  plaintiff's brother-in-law,\n\nPatrick  Dello  Iacono, who  was  a sergeant  on  the Everett\n\nPolice department.  Viau decided to interview plaintiff after\n\nconsultation  with  her   supervisors,  Foley,  Ceruolo,  and\n\nJustiniano.\n\n                      THE SLANDER COUNT\n                                       \n\n          Because this is a diversity case, Massachusetts law\n\napplies.    We   agree  with  the  district  court  that  the\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nstatement, \"National has strong  evidence you are involved in\n\na car  theft,\" was slanderous.

It's people like\n\nyou\"; and \"If you don't speak now, you will be prosecuted.\"\n\n          We do  not think that these  statements should have\n\nbeen  excised  from the  accusation of  car  theft.   All the\n\nstatements  made  by  Viau  were  part  and  parcel  of  that\n\naccusation.   This is  not a  situation where  statements are\n\nmade  at different  times  and in  different  contexts.   The\n\nstatements were made during  one interview.  National accused\n\nplaintiff of car theft,  and because she denied it,  said she\n\nwas a  liar.   Part of  the theft accusation  was that  as an\n\nemployee  of  National,  she  had the  knowledge  of  company\n\npractice and the opportunity  to commit the theft.   She also\n\nwas told that  if she did not confess to  the theft she would\n\nbe prosecuted.  The statements, taken as a whole, constituted\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\na single accusation that  Lyons had stolen a company  car and\n\nan attempt by National to have her confess to the accusation.\n\n          Defendant  argues that  because  plaintiff did  not\n\nspecifically object to the district court rulings finding the\n\nstatements not slanderous during the Rule 50 hearings, she is\n\nprecluded from raising the issue here.   There is no merit to\n\nthis contention.   The  plaintiff argued that  the statements\n\nwere slanderous during the Rule 50 hearing.  Tr., 2d day, pp.\n\n95-97.   And  she also  argues  to  the same  effect  in  her\n\nappellate  brief.    Plaintiff's  Brief  at  13.    This  was\n\nsufficient to preserve  the issue  for review.   There is  no\n\nrequirement that specific objections  to the court's  rulings\n\nbe  made during  a Rule  50 hearing.    It suffices  that the\n\nplaintiff raise the issues so that the court understands what\n\nthey are.  This was clearly done here.  The  requirement that\n\nspecific objections  be made to the  introduction of evidence\n\nor to the court's  final charge to the jury do  not, contrary\n\nto defendant's suggestion, apply to a Rule 50 hearing.\n\n          Although   defendant   has  not   argued   lack  of\n\npublication on appeal, the  district court did express doubts\n\nabout publication during the Rule 50 hearing.  We simply note\n\nthat the  publication requirement for a  slander action under\n\nMassachusetts law  was met here.   Brauer v.

The  presence of  the third\n\nperson in the  interrogation room was sufficient to  meet the\n\npublication requirement.  \n\n          We now  turn to  the related issues  of conditional\n\nprivilege  and malice.  We agree with the district court that\n\nthe facts giving rise to a conditional privilege  by National\n\nwere  proven  during plaintiff's  case-in-chief.

Plaintiff was told at the outset by\n\nViau:   \"I have strong evidence  that you were involved  in a\n\ncompany  theft.\"    Viau  pointed  to  a  folder  during  the\n\naccusation;  this implied  that it  contained such  evidence.\n\nBut the evidence was not  disclosed to plaintiff, despite her\n\nrequest to  see it.  In fact,  there was no \"strong evidence\"\n\nthat plaintiff had  been involved  in a company  theft.   All\n\nthat National had  at that  time was, at  best, a  reasonable\n\nsuspicion.   Plaintiff was then  called a liar  and told that\n\nbecause  of her position in the company she had the knowledge\n\nto  commit  the   theft.    She  was  then   threatened  with\n\nprosecution and loss of her job if she did not confess to the\n\ntheft.  These statements considered as a whole could be found\n\nto be \"reckless\" under Massachusetts law.\n\n          We  also   think  that  \"malice   in  fact\"   could\n\nlegitimately be found.  First, there was evidence  from which\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\na  jury  could find  that  plaintiff's  immediate supervisor,\n\nJustiniano,  either  disliked  plaintiff  personally  or  was\n\ndispleased with her conduct  at the meeting.  But  of telling\n\nsignificance was the conduct of the interrogation.  In  fact,\n\nit was not an interrogation  but an inquisition.  Accusations\n\nand  threats were made; there was no attempt to determine the\n\nfacts objectively.  The manner in which the interrogation was\n\nconducted  fairly reeked  of malice.  It could  reasonably be\n\nfound that the accusations and threats made to plaintiff were\n\n\"the  willful  doing  of  an  injurious  act  without  lawful\n\nexcuse.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Bratt,</span> <span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">131</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, n.9.\n               \n\n          The judgment  of the district court  on the slander\n\ncount  is  reversed.

The  Court\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nstated,  for  example,   that  Congress   declined  to   make\n\nmunicipalities  vicariously  liable  under     1983,  despite\n\narguments that vicarious liability would reduce the incidence\n\nof  unconstitutional  acts  and  would  spread  the  cost  of\n\ninjuries throughout  the community.   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  at 693-94. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  These\n                                         \n\njustifications    are    equally   applicable    to   private\n\ncorporations.\n\n          The  Massachusetts legislature enacted  the MCRA in\n\n1979,  one year  after Monell  was decided.   Presumably, the\n                             \n\nlegislature was aware of Monell.  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Duarte,</span> <span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1232</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n                                        \n\nThe  language of  the MCRA  contains  no indication  that the\n\nlegislature  intended  to  expand   the  scope  of   employer\n\nliability under the MCRA beyond that available under    1983.\n\nCompare Mass. Gen. Laws  ch. 12,   11H (\"Whenever  any person\n       \n\nor  persons,  whether  or  not  acting  under  color of  law,\n\ninterfere  by threats, intimidation or  coercion . . .\") with\n                                                             \n\n42  U.S.C.   1983 (\"Every  person who, under  color [of law],\n\nsubjects, or  causes to be  subjected, any [other  person] to\n\nthe deprivation of any rights . . .\").  Moreover, it is clear\n\nthat  the  state  legislature   knew  how  to  pass  statutes\n\nembracing the  doctrine of respondeat superior.   E.g., Mass.\n                                                      \n\nGen. Laws ch. 151B   3(1) (\"It shall be an unlawful practice:\n\nFor  an employer, by himself or his agent\" to discriminate on\n\nthe basis of race, religion, ethnicity, sex, or age); </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> ch.\n                                                         \n\n258, </span><pre class=\"inline\">  2  (\"Public employers  shall be liable  for injury  or\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nloss of  property . .  . caused by the  negligent or wrongful\n\nact  or omission of  any public employee  while acting within\n\nthe scope  of his  office or  employment .  . .  .\") (enacted\n\n1978).  Finally, the  parties have not cited anything  in the\n\nlegislative  history   of  the   MCRA  indicating  that   the\n\nlegislature intended to make employers vicariously liable for\n\nthe  acts  of their  employees.   Accordingly,  we  hold that\n\nclaims  against employers under  the MCRA cannot  rest on the\n\ndoctrine of respondeat superior. \n\n                           SUMMARY\n                                  \n\n          We reverse  the district  court's  judgment on  the\n\nslander  claim and on the  loss of consortium  claim based on\n\nthe slander issue and remand for a new trial on those claims.\n\nAs  to  the MCRA  claim,  the  district court's  judgment  is\n\naffirmed. \n\n          Affirmed in part, reversed in part.
