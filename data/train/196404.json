Stern, United  States  Attorney,  and Cheryl  L.\r                                                                           \r\nConner, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r                \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per  Curiam.   In an  earlier decision,  this court\r                                 \r\n\nreversed  a summary  judgment  against  appellant  Ronan  and\r\n\nremanded   for  a  trial   her  claims  of   gender  and  age\r\n\ndiscrimination in the denial of a promotional opportunity  by\r\n\nher  employer,   the  EPA.    Ronan   v.  U.S.  Environmental\r                                                                         \r\n\nProtection  Agency, No. 89-1566, slip op. at 3 (1st Cir. Mar.\r                              \r\n\n27,  1990) (per curiam).  Following a bench trial held over a\r                                  \r\n\nthree day  period, the  district  court awarded  judgment  in\r\n\nfavor  of the  EPA.   The  court found  that while  Ronan had\r\n\nestablished  a prima facie case,  she had not  shown that the\r\n\nEPA's proof  of neutral,  non-discriminatory reasons  for the\r\n\ndecision concealed a prohibited discriminatory motive or act.\r\n\nIn short, the trial court found credible the testimony of the\r\n\nEPA employees who made the decision.\r\n\n          Having  carefully  reviewed  the   transcripts  and\r\n\nbriefs,  we  find  no  clear error  in  the  court's  factual\r\n\nfindings.  See  Lussier v.  Runyon, 50 F.3d  1103, 1111  (1st\r                                              \r\n\nCir. 1995)  (district court's  factual  findings in  a  bench\r\n\ntrial are  reviewed  only  for  \"clear error\").    The  trial\r\n\njudge's  choice between  plausible  competing  inferences  is\r\n\nentitled to  deference on review, especially  when the choice\r\n\nis informed  by an assessment of the demeanor and credibility\r\n\nof the witnesses.  See Anderson v. City of Bessemer, 470 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n564, 573 (1985);  Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R.,  902 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n148,  152 (1st Cir. 1990);  Williams v. Poulos,  11 F.3d 271,\r                                                          \r\n\n278 (1st Cir. 1993) (credibility). \r\r\n\n          We find  no support  in the record  for appellant's\r\n\nbald assertions that the court failed to conduct an impartial\r\n\ntrial, did not  rule on her motions,  and unfairly disfavored\r\n\nher cause in evidentiary rulings and the denial of  appointed\r\n\ncounsel.  To the contrary, the record reflects that the court\r\n\nruled  on every motion, conducted a  fair and orderly hearing\r\n\nwithout prejudicial error, and  was solicitous of appellant's\r\n\npro se status throughout.  No exceptional reason requiring an\r                  \r\n\nappointment of counsel is suggested.  We also see no error in\r\n\nthe denial of appellant's jury demand in light of Landgraf v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nUSI Film Prods., 114 S. Ct. 1483 (1994), nor in the dismissal\r                           \r\n\nof her attempt  to retry  a retaliation claim  that had  been\r\n\nrejected in a collateral forum, and never appealed.  \r\n\n          Appellant lists as error some  forty-eight district\r\n\ncourt orders, many of which were entered prior to the summary\r\n\njudgment appeal and  remand of her claims for trial.  We fail\r\n\nto see the relevance of these early procedural rulings to the\r\n\nissues on this appeal.  Any perceived substantive errors were\r\n\nwaived, at the latest  with appellant's filing of  an amended\r\n\ncomplaint after remand.  For like reason, we find no abuse in\r\n\nthe court's  rejection of  appellant's motions  to supplement\r\n\nthe  record  with archival  documents relating  to irrelevant\r\n\nearly rulings. \r\n\n          We have reviewed the record with care.  It contains\r\n\nall  the docketed items needed  for a thorough  airing of the\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nissues.   We appreciate appellant's  concern about a  missing\r\n\npartial  transcript  containing  the  testimony   of  witness\r\n\nWilliam  Chenoweth (Dkt.  160).   Its  absence, however,  has\r\n\ncaused her no prejudice in this court.  A full  transcript of\r\n\nthe proceedings was  certified to us on  appeal.  Chenoweth's\r\n\ntestimony, in its entirety, has been considered by  the court\r\n\nalong  with the rest of the record.  The occasional docketing\r\n\nerrors to which appellant points,  and mistakes in the  EPA's\r\n\nappellate   filings,  also  have   caused  no   prejudice  to\r\n\nappellant. \r\n\n          Accordingly,  the  judgment   below  is   affirmed.\r                                                                        \r\n\nAppellant's motion  \"for Correction  and Modification of  the\r\n\nRecord,\"  and \"Petition  for  Judicial Opinion  on Denial  of\r\n\nConstitutional  Rights,\"  including  attachments labelled  as\r\n\nmotions, \"In  Objection to  Harassment and Violations  by the\r\n\nU.S. District Court and U.S. Court of Appeals,\" \"In Objection\r\n\nto  Harassment and Abusive Use of Power by Clerks and Judges\"\r\n\nand  \"In  Objection  to Denial  of  Access  to  United States\r\n\nCourts,\" are denied.\r                               \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
