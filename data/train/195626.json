In  the  late   1980's,\n                                \n\nplaintiffs-appellants purchased shares of two  separate \"junk\n\nbond\"  funds.    After  the value  of  the  purchased  shares\n\nplummeted,  plaintiffs alleged various federal securities law\n\nviolations.   In a  series of  related rulings,  the district\n\ncourt dismissed  some of plaintiffs' allegations  for failure\n\nto  state a claim, and  granted summary judgment  in favor of\n\ndefendants  on all remaining claims.   We affirm  in part and\n\nreverse in part.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n           FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                                   \n\n          Prior to this appeal,  the proceedings in these two\n\ncases were not formally consolidated.  As the district  court\n\nnoted,  the two cases raise many identical issues.  Thus, our\n\ndiscussion, unless  we specifically state  otherwise, applies\n\nequally to both cases.\n\n          In 1988,  both New  America High Income  Fund, Inc.\n\nand  Prospect Street  High Income  Portfolio, Inc.  (\"the New\n\nAmerica   Fund,\"   and   \"the  Prospect   Street   Fund,\"  or\n\ncollectively \"the funds\") were  first publicly offered on the\n\nNew York Stock Exchange.   Each fund's purpose, as  stated in\n\ntheir  nearly  identical prospectuses,  was  to  invest in  a\n\ndiversified portfolio of high yield  fixed-income securities,\n\ncommonly known as \"junk bonds.\"   \n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          In  April  1989,  well  after  the  initial  public\n\nofferings,  a study  headed by  Professor Paul  Asquith (\"the\n\nAsquith study\") disclosed that the default rate of junk bonds\n\nwas  much higher  than had been  previously believed.1   This\n\nconclusion was reached by  calculating the adverse effects of\n\n\"aging\" on junk bonds.2  \n\n          Within months of the  study, though not necessarily\n\nas a direct result  of the study, the  market for junk  bonds\n\nbegan  to collapse.  By November 1989, both funds had reduced\n\ntheir  dividends,  and  the  share  value of  each  fund  had\n\ndeclined considerably.\n\n                    \n\n1.  The results of the Asquith  study were first made  public\nthrough various financial and general periodicals in April of\n1989.  See, e.g., Kenneth N. Gilpin, Further Rise in Rates is\n                                                             \nExpected, N.Y. Times, Apr.  10, 1989, at D9; Linda  Sandler &amp;\n        \nMichael Siconolfi,  Junk Bonds  are Taking Their  Lumps, Wall\n                                                       \nSt.  J., Apr.  14, 1989,  at C1.   The  study itself  was not\npublished  until September 1989.   See Paul  Asquith, et al.,\n                                      \nOriginal Issue High Yield Bonds:  Aging Analyses of Defaults,\n                                                             \nExchanges and Calls, 44 J. Fin., No. 4 (September 1989).\n                   \n\n2.  The record reveals that, prior to the Asquith study,  the\ntraditionally  accepted  method  of determining  annual  bond\ndefault  rates was to divide the total number of defaults per\nyear by the total size of the relevant market sector for that\nyear.   As  the  affidavit of  Professor Asquith  points out,\nhowever,  this  method  loses   its  accuracy  in  a  rapidly\nexpanding  market, such as the junk bond market of the 1970's\nand  '80's, where  new issues  greatly enlarged  the existing\nmarket.   In  other words,  the traditional  method does  not\nreveal whether  a preponderance of older or  newer issues are\ndefaulting in a given year.\n          Breaking   from   the    traditional   method    of\ncalculation, Asquith's  study  tracked the  default  rate  of\nbonds based on their  dates of issuance.  The  study revealed\nthat  junk bonds become more  likely to default  as they grow\nolder, hence the term \"aging.\"\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          Plaintiffs,  who consist  of  putative  classes  of\n\npurchasers  of each fund,  commenced parallel actions against\n\nthe  two funds.   The  First Amended  Complaints (hereinafter\n\n\"the  original complaints\") were lengthy, alleging violations\n\nof a  variety of  federal securities laws,  including section\n\n10(b) of the  Securities Exchange  Act of 1934,  15 U.S.C.   \n\n78j(b),  and sections 11 and  12(2) of the  Securities Act of\n\n1933, 15 U.S.C.     77k, 77l(2).3  The  gist of the  original\n\ncomplaints  was  that  the  funds'  directors,  advisors  and\n\nunderwriters (\"defendants\") knew of, but failed to  disclose,\n\nadverse  information   about  the  junk  bond   market.    In\n\nparticular, the complaints alleged that defendants had agreed\n\nto act, and had in  fact acted, as purchasers of  last resort\n\nfor undesirable junk bonds; that  they knew of infirmities in\n\n                    \n\n3.  Sections  10(b), 11  and 12(2)  all  prohibit the  use of\nmaterially misleading  information in the sale of securities,\nand  the  same conduct  may  be  actionable under  all  three\nsections.   See, e.g.,  Herman &amp;  MacLean v.  Huddleston, 459\n                                                        \nU.S. 375, 382-83 (1983) (stating that the same conduct may be\nactionable under  sections 10(b) and 11); Shapiro v.

New  Am. High Income\n                                                             \n\nFund, 755 F. Supp.  1099 (D.

Mass. 1991)  (\"Lucia I\"),  but nonetheless  allowed both\n                           \n\nsets of plaintiffs to replead.\n\n          Plaintiffs' Second  Amended Complaints (hereinafter\n\n\"the revised complaints\") alleged causes of action only under\n\nsections 11 and 12(2).  All section 10(b) claims presented in\n\nthe original  complaints were  dropped.  Among  other things,\n\nthe  revised  complaints  focused  on a  ten-year  comparison\n\nbetween junk  bonds  and United  States  Treasury  securities\n\n(\"Treasury   securities\")   that   was   included    in   the\n\nprospectuses.5   Though the ten-year figure  showed that junk\n\n                    \n\n4.  The  original  complaints also  alleged  RICO  claims and\ncommon law fraud claims, which were dismissed by the district\ncourt.  Plaintiffs do not appeal these dismissals. \n\n5.  The relevant portion of the New America Fund's prospectus\nstates:\n\n          The   Fund's   portfolio   will   consist\n          primarily   of  \"high   yield\"  corporate\n          bonds. . . .\n\n          \"High  yield\" bonds offer  a higher yield\n          to  maturity  than   bonds  with   higher\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n                    \n\n          ratings  as  compensation for  holding an\n          obligation  of an issuer  perceived to be\n          less  credit worthy.   The  DBL composite\n          measures  the  performance  of  the  most\n          representative bonds in the  \"high yield\"\n          market  and is compiled monthly by Drexel\n          Burnham  Lambert  Incorporated.    As  of\n          December  31,  1987,  the  DBL  Composite\n          offered  a  yield  spread  of  484  basis\n          points (i.e., 4.84%;  1% equals 100 basis\n          points)  over   the  comparable  Treasury\n          security,  7%  U.S.  Treasury  due  1994.\n          U.S.  Treasury securities  are considered\n          to have minimal risk.  The average spread\n          between   the   DBL  Composite   and  the\n          comparable  U.S.  Treasury issue  was 358\n          basis  points for 1980,  397 basis points\n          for 1981, 503 basis  points for 1982, 337\n          basis points  for 1983, 311  basis points\n          for 1984, 362 basis  points for 1985, 496\n          basis  points  for  1986  and  451  basis\n          points for 1987.\n\n          For  the years  1977  through  1986,  the\n          spread  in  yields  between \"high  yield\"\n          securities   and    representative   U.S.\n          Treasury    securities    has    averaged\n          approximately 393 basis points.  For this\n          period,   the   loss  in   principal  and\n          interest  due to defaults on \"high yield\"\n          securities has  averaged approximately 97\n          basis points.  Thus,  for the period 1977\n          to 1986, the  net average spread  between\n          \"high      yield\"     securities      and\n          representative  U.S. Treasury  securities\n          (i.e., the average  spread between  \"high\n          yield\"   securities  and   U.S.  Treasury\n          securities,  minus  the  average  default\n          loss  on \"high yield\" securities) was 296\n          basis  points.   For  1987, the  loss  of\n          principal and interest due to defaults is\n          estimated to have been 125 basis points.*\n          However,   past    performance   is   not\n          necessarily    indicative    of    future\n          performance. . . .\n\n          The capital  structure  of the  Fund  has\n          been  designed to  take advantage  of the\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nbonds  had  outperformed  Treasury  securities,  the  revised\n\ncomplaints  alleged that during  the six years  leading up to\n\neach fund's public offering, Treasury securities had actually\n\noutperformed junk bonds.6   \n\n          Shortly  after the  revised complaints  were filed,\n\ndefendants moved  for summary  judgment.  The  district court\n\nbegan  by ruling as  a matter of  law that the  comparison to\n\nTreasury securities in  the prospectuses was not  misleading.\n\n                    \n\n          historical spread in yields between \"high\n          yield\" securities and representative U.S.\n          Treasury  securities,  compared with  the\n          average  default  loss  on  \"high  yield\"\n          securities.  \n\n          *  Statistical  data appearing  above are\n          based on information  provided by  Drexel\n          Burnham Lambert Incorporated.\n\nThe Prospect  Street prospectus is  similarly structured  and\nworded.  \n          We   note  in  passing  that  the  Prospect  Street\nprospectus reports significantly different annual spreads for\nthe  years 1980 through 1987.  Because neither the Miller nor\n                                                         \nthe Lucia plaintiffs have argued,  either below or on appeal,\n         \nthat these inconsistencies are  actionable, we deem the issue\nwaived.\n\n6.

While  we  generally  credit  all\n\nallegations  in   the  complaint  and  draw   all  reasonable\n\ninferences favorable to the plaintiff, id., Rule 9(b) imposes\n                                          \n\nheightened  pleading requirements  for allegations  of fraud.\n\n\"In  all averments  of  fraud or  mistake, the  circumstances\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nconstituting   fraud   or  mistake   shall  be   stated  with\n\nparticularity.\"  Fed.

Consistent with Fed. R. Civ. P.\n          9(b),  the  complaint   must  set   forth\n          specific facts that make it reasonable to\n          believe  that  defendant[s]  knew that  a\n          statement   was   materially   false   or\n          misleading.  The  rule requires that  the\n          particular times, dates, places  or other\n          details   of   the   alleged   fraudulent\n          involvement of the actors be alleged.\n\nSerabian v.

The Original Complaints\n                                     \n\n          Plaintiffs'  original  complaints  alleged  various\n\nwrongdoing  by   defendants.    The  common   thread  running\n\nthroughout  the  original   complaints,  however,  was   that\n\ndefendants knew of  infirmities in the junk  bond market, and\n\nthat  they   nonetheless  entered  a  vast   web  of  illicit\n\nagreements with Drexel Burnham  Lambert, and with former junk\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nbond dealer Michael Milken, in order  to become purchasers of\n\nlast resort for undesirable junk bonds. \n\n          The  district court  properly concluded  that these\n\ngeneral  allegations in  the original complaints  were wholly\n\nconclusory.   No  factual  basis is  put  forward to  support\n\nplaintiffs'  theory that  defendants  consorted with  Drexel,\n\nthat  they dealt with Michael Milken, that they agreed to act\n\nas purchasers of last resort  for undesirable bonds, or  that\n\nthey knew  enough to anticipate the impending fall-out of the\n\njunk bond market.   Because all  of plaintiffs' 10(b)  claims\n\nrely  fundamentally  on  such  unsupported  allegations,  the\n\ndistrict court properly dismissed these claims for failure to\n\nmeet Rule 9(b).7  Cf.  Romani, 929 F.2d at 878  (finding that\n                             \n\ncomplaint failed to satisfy Rule  9(b) where it contained \"no\n\nfactual allegations that would support a reasonable inference\n\nthat  adverse  circumstances  existed  at  the  time  of  the\n\noffering,  and  were  known  and  deliberately  or recklessly\n\ndisregarded by defendants\").\n\nB.

Given   adequate   grounds   to  support   dismissal   of\nplaintiffs'  section 10(b)  claims, we  expressly  decline to\naddress  the district court's  \"loss causation\" analysis, and\nits  use of Bastian v.  Petren Resources Corp.,  892 F.2d 680\n                                              \n(7th Cir.), cert.  denied, 496 U,S. 906 (1990),  in rejecting\n                         \nthese same claims.\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\n          As noted above, plaintiffs were allowed to replead.\n\nDefendants'  motions for summary  judgment soon followed, and\n\nsummary judgment was granted in favor of defendants.\n\n          1.

R. Civ.  P.\n\n56(c).    In  seeking  to  forestall  the  entry  of  summary\n\njudgment, a  nonmovant may not  rely upon allegations  in its\n\npleadings.   Rather, the  nonmovant must \"set  forth specific\n\nfacts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"  Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(e).\n\n          2.  Parallel Paths Diverge\n                                    \n\n          Both   complaints   alleged   that   the   six-year\n\ncomparison  favored  Treasury  securities.   And  the  Miller\n                                                             \n\nplaintiffs, unlike the Lucia plaintiffs, in their response to\n                            \n\ndefendants' motion  for  summary judgment,  set  forth  facts\n\nshowing that the six-year figure, as well as a shorter three-\n\nyear figure, actually favored Treasury securities.  Moreover,\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nthe district court squarely addressed this argument in ruling\n\non the Miller  defendants' motion for summary judgment.   See\n                                                             \n\nIn re New Am. High Income Fund Sec. Litig., 834 F. Supp. 501,\n                                          \n\n506-07  (D. Mass.  1993).   Accordingly, we  see no  merit to\n\ndefendants' argument that the  Miller plaintiffs waived  this\n                                     \n\nissue. \n\n          The Lucia plaintiffs,  however, failed to  preserve\n                   \n\nthis  issue.  In  fact, the  Lucia plaintiffs'  opposition to\n                                  \n\ndefendants' summary judgment motion fails to even mention the\n\nsix-year comparison.   Despite the  striking similarities  in\n\nthese two cases, the Lucia plaintiffs pursued a significantly\n                          \n\ndifferent  tack in  opposing defendants'  motion  for summary\n\njudgment,  and  failed  to  argue that  the  Prospect  Street\n\nprospectus was  misleading due  to its  failure to  include a\n\nshorter-term  comparison  to Treasury  securities.   As noted\n\nabove,  a nonmovant faced with  a motion for summary judgment\n\nmay not rest on its pleadings.  Moreover, we see no reason in\n\nthis case to relax our general rule that \"theories not raised\n\nsquarely before the district court cannot be surfaced for the\n\nfirst  time  on  appeal.\"  McCoy v.

We  begin by noting\n\nthat the six  years at issue are the six  years leading up to\n\nthe  fund's public offering.   Moreover, while any one or two\n\nyears might favor Treasury securities without amounting to an\n\nunfavorable  trend,  we  think  that  a  six-year  comparison\n\nfavoring Treasury  securities is  substantial enough  to cast\n\nsome  doubt  on  the  reliability of  the  reported  ten-year\n\nfigure.   In other words,  we cannot say  as a matter  of law\n\nthat  the undisclosed information  about the  six-year period\n\nwould  not  alter the  total mix  of  facts available  to the\n\ninvestor.   Rather,  a  jury  could  find  that  there  is  a\n\nsubstantial  likelihood that  a reasonable  shareholder would\n\nconsider the six-year comparison  important to the investment\n\ndecision.  See Milton, 961 F.2d at 969.    \n                     \n\n          We expressly  decline to  make hard and  fast rules\n\nabout the  time length of reported  investment results, i.e.,\n\nwe  do not  hold  that ten-year  comparisons  must always  be\n\naccompanied by shorter-term comparisons.  Nor do we hold that\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\na  plaintiff always creates a triable issue of fact by merely\n\nunearthing unfavorable news regarding shorter  time intervals\n\nthan those reported.  \n\n          Moreover, the unfavorable  six-year figure in  this\n\ncase  does  not  necessarily render  the  ten-year comparison\n                            \n\nmisleading.   Rather, a  jury, knowing the  individual annual\n\nreturns  over the ten-year period at issue (which are not now\n\nascertainable  on the  record before  us) and  perhaps having\n\nother guideposts for determining the relative  reliability of\n\nshorter- and longer-term bond comparisons, may conclude  that\n\nthe ten-year  comparison standing alone is  not misleading at\n\nall.           Because the district  court felt it irrelevant\n\nthat  defendants  had  not   reported  the  claimed  six-year\n\nnegative trend,  it gave no  attention to whether  the Miller\n                                                             \n\nplaintiffs had adequately established a factual base -- viz.,\n\nthat  defendants knew,  or reasonably  should have  known, of\n\nthat change of circumstances.  While we have some doubt about\n\nthe adequacy  of the Miller plaintiffs'  proof of defendants'\n                           \n\nknowledge, we  nonetheless recognize  that discovery on  this\n\nissue was limited.   We reverse and remand to  permit further\n\ndiscovery in this area.   Following such discovery, the court\n\nmay then reconsider defendants' motion  for summary judgment,\n\nif defendants choose to renew it.\n\n          Thus, on  the current state  of the  record in  the\n\nMiller case, summary judgment on this issue was improper.

Having established this\n\nfact, the district  court erred in  concluding in the  Miller\n                                                             \n\ncase that the comparison nonetheless  was not misleading as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n          4.  Other Summary Judgment Issues\n                                           \n\n          While  fact  issues  remain  with   regard  to  the\n\nTreasury security comparison in the Miller case, the district\n                                          \n\ncourt properly  granted summary judgment on  all other issues\n\nin  both cases.   For  example,  plaintiffs alleged  that (1)\n\ndefendants  knew or  should  have known  of  the effect  that\n\n\"aging\" calculations  have on determining junk  bond returns,\n\nand  (2) defendants should not have used the DBL composite as\n\nan  indicator of past performance of  junk bonds because that\n\ncomposite failed to account for \"forced bond exchanges.\"8  \n\n          It is  doubtless true, as  plaintiffs allege,  that\n\nseveral significant studies with regard to \"aging\" discovered\n\nstatistical  infirmities  in   the  traditional  methods   of\n\ncalculating junk  bond returns.  However,  these studies were\n\ncompleted only after the prospectuses were issued.  Moreover,\n\naccording to affidavits in the record, the Asquith study  was\n\n                    \n\n8.  Forced  bond exchanges, also  known as  \"distressed\" bond\nexchanges,  occur when a bond issuer,  rather than default on\nits existing  obligations, exchanges  them for a  new set  of\nobligations.\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\nthe first study  of its  kind to display  the infirmities  of\n\nprevious  calculation methods.   Plaintiffs failed  to adduce\n\nany facts  which, contrary to  defendants' affidavits,  would\n\ntend to show that defendants were aware of these infirmities,\n\nor that they could or should  have been aware of the  effects\n\nof  \"aging\" analysis  at  the time  the funds  were initially\n\noffered  to the public.  Given plaintiffs' failure to raise a\n\ntriable issue of fact, we  affirm the district court's  grant\n\nof summary judgment on this issue.\n\n          A   similar   analysis   disposes  of   plaintiffs'\n\nallegation that  the DBL composite, relied  on extensively by\n\ndefendants in the prospectuses,  failed to account for forced\n\nbond exchanges.  Defendants  offered affidavits to the effect\n\nthat  forced bond exchanges in fact were accounted for in the\n\nDBL composite.  Plaintiffs offer no evidence to the contrary.\n\nAccordingly,  we find no error  in the district court's grant\n\nof summary judgment on this issue.  Because further discovery\n\nwill occur in the Miller case, we leave to the district court\n                        \n\nthe formulation  of the extent of  that discovery, consistent\n\nwith the ruling made herein.\n\n          Lastly, defendant Prudential Bache,  an underwriter\n\nof the New America  Fund, argues that claims against  it were\n\nuntimely filed.  The district court did not rule  on when the\n\nstatute of  limitations in this case began to run, nor can we\n\nmake  such   a  determination   on  the  record   before  us.\n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\nAccordingly, we  leave this important procedural  issue to be\n\ndetermined in the first instance by the district court.\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          We  have carefully  considered all  other arguments\n\nand find them to be either  waived or without merit.  For the\n\nforegoing reasons,  the various orders of  the district court\n\nare\n\n          Affirmed in full as  to the Lucia case, and,  as to\n                                                             \n\nthe  Miller  case, affirmed  in part,  reversed in  part, and\n                                                             \n\nremanded   for  further  proceedings   consistent  with  this\n                                                             \n\nopinion.\n        \n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n",

After the value of the purchased shares plummeted, plaintiffs alleged various federal securities law violations.  In a series of related rulings, the district court dismissed some of plaintiffs' allegations for failure to state a claim, and granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on all remaining claims.  We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to this appeal, the proceedings in these two cases were not formally consolidated.  As the district court noted, the two cases raise many identical issues.  Thus, our discussion, unless we specifically state otherwise, applies equally to both cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1988, both New America High Income Fund, Inc. and Prospect Street High Income Portfolio, Inc.  (\"the New America Fund,\" and \"the Prospect Street Fund,\" or collectively \"the funds\") were first publicly offered on the New York Stock Exchange.  Each fund's purpose, as stated in their nearly identical prospectuses, was to invest in a diversified portfolio of high yield fixed-income securities, commonly known as \"junk bonds.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1989, well after the initial public offerings, a study headed by Professor Paul Asquith (\"the Asquith study\") disclosed that the default rate of junk bonds was much higher than had been previously believed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  This conclusion was reached by calculating the adverse effects of \"aging\" on junk bonds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within months of the study, though not necessarily as a direct result of the study, the market for junk bonds began to collapse.  By November 1989, both funds had reduced their dividends, and the share value of each fund had declined considerably.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs, who consist of putative classes of purchasers of each fund, commenced parallel actions against the two funds.  The First Amended Complaints (hereinafter \"the original complaints\") were lengthy, alleging violations of a variety of federal securities laws, including section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78j(b), and sections 11 and 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. Secs. 77k, 77l(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The gist of the original complaints was that the funds' directors, advisors and underwriters (\"defendants\") knew of, but failed to disclose, adverse information about the junk bond market.  In particular, the complaints alleged that defendants had agreed to act, and had in fact acted, as purchasers of last resort for undesirable junk bonds;  that they knew of infirmities in the junk bond market at the time they publicly offered shares of the funds and thereafter;  and that misleading statistics were used in the prospectuses to portray the historical performance of junk bonds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed many of plaintiffs' claims on the pleadings, see Miller v. New Am.  High Income Fund, 755 F.Supp. 1099 (D.Mass.1991) (\"Miller I \");  Lucia v. Prospect St. High Income Portfolio, Inc., 769 F.Supp. 410 (D.Mass.1991) (\"Lucia I \"), but nonetheless allowed both sets of plaintiffs to replead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaints (hereinafter \"the revised complaints\") alleged causes of action only under sections 11 and 12(2).  All section 10(b) claims presented in the original complaints were dropped.  Among other things, the revised complaints focused on a ten-year comparison between junk bonds and United States Treasury securities (\"Treasury securities\") that was included in the prospectuses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Though the ten-year figure showed that junk bonds had outperformed Treasury securities, the revised complaints alleged that during the six years leading up to each fund's public offering, Treasury securities had actually outperformed junk bonds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the revised complaints were filed, defendants moved for summary judgment.  The district court began by ruling as a matter of law that the comparison to Treasury securities in the prospectuses was not misleading.  See In re New Am.  High Income Fund Sec. Litig., 834 F.Supp. 501, 506-07 (D.Mass.1993) (\"Miller II \").   It went on to grant summary judgment in favor of defendants on all other claims.  Id.;  Lucia v. Prospect St. High Income Portfolio, Inc., No. 90-10781-MA (D.Mass. Aug. 26 1993) (\"Lucia II \").  Plaintiffs appeal these various rulings.

Northeast Doran, Inc. v. Key Bank of Maine, 15 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1994).  While we generally credit all allegations in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences favorable to the plaintiff, id., Rule 9(b) imposes heightened pleading requirements for allegations of fraud.  \"In all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have stated in a recent discussion of Rule 9(b) in the securities context:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>[G]eneral averments of the defendants' knowledge of material falsity will not suffice.

Moreover, this heightened pleading is required \"even when the fraud relates to matters peculiarly within the knowledge of the opposing party.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Original Complaints</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' original complaints alleged various wrongdoing by defendants.  The common thread running throughout the original complaints, however, was that defendants knew of infirmities in the junk bond market, and that they nonetheless entered a vast web of illicit agreements with Drexel Burnham Lambert, and with former junk bond dealer Michael Milken, in order to become purchasers of last resort for undesirable junk bonds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court properly concluded that these general allegations in the original complaints were wholly conclusory.  No factual basis is put forward to support plaintiffs' theory that defendants consorted with Drexel, that they dealt with Michael Milken, that they agreed to act as purchasers of last resort for undesirable bonds, or that they knew enough to anticipate the impending fall-out of the junk bond market.  Because all of plaintiffs' 10(b) claims rely fundamentally on such unsupported allegations, the district court properly dismissed these claims for failure to meet Rule 9(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Cf. Romani, 929 F.2d at 878 (finding that complaint failed to satisfy Rule 9(b) where it contained \"no factual allegations that would support a reasonable inference that adverse circumstances existed at the time of the offering, and were known and deliberately or recklessly disregarded by defendants\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

Boto, 24 F.3d 335, 338 (1st Cir.1994).  We read the record indulging all inferences in favor of the non-moving party.  Id.

Parallel Paths Diverge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both complaints alleged that the six-year comparison favored Treasury securities.  And the Miller plaintiffs, unlike the Lucia plaintiffs, in their response to defendants' motion for summary judgment, set forth facts showing that the six-year figure, as well as a shorter three-year figure, actually favored Treasury securities.  Moreover, the district court squarely addressed this argument in ruling on the Miller defendants' motion for summary judgment.  See In re New Am.  High Income Fund Sec. Litig., 834 F.Supp. 501, 506-07 (D.Mass.1993).  Accordingly, we see no merit to defendants' argument that the Miller plaintiffs waived this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Lucia plaintiffs, however, failed to preserve this issue.  In fact, the Lucia plaintiffs' opposition to defendants' summary judgment motion fails to even mention the six-year comparison.  Despite the striking similarities in these two cases, the Lucia plaintiffs pursued a significantly different tack in opposing defendants' motion for summary judgment, and failed to argue that the Prospect Street prospectus was misleading due to its failure to include a shorter-term comparison to Treasury securities.  As noted above, a nonmovant faced with a motion for summary judgment may not rest on its pleadings.  Moreover, we see no reason in this case to relax our general rule that \"theories not raised squarely before the district court cannot be surfaced for the first time on appeal.\"  McCoy v.

We begin by noting that the six years at issue are the six years leading up to the fund's public offering.  Moreover, while any one or two years might favor Treasury securities without amounting to an unfavorable trend, we think that a six-year comparison favoring Treasury securities is substantial enough to cast some doubt on the reliability of the reported ten-year figure.  In other words, we cannot say as a matter of law that the undisclosed information about the six-year period would not alter the total mix of facts available to the investor.  Rather, a jury could find that there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider the six-year comparison important to the investment decision.  See Milton, 961 F.2d at 969.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We expressly decline to make hard and fast rules about the time length of reported investment results, i.e., we do not hold that ten-year comparisons must always be accompanied by shorter-term comparisons.  Nor do we hold that a plaintiff always creates a triable issue of fact by merely unearthing unfavorable news regarding shorter time intervals than those reported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the unfavorable six-year figure in this case does not necessarily render the ten-year comparison misleading.  Rather, a jury, knowing the individual annual returns over the ten-year period at issue (which are not now ascertainable on the record before us) and perhaps having other guideposts for determining the relative reliability of shorter- and longer-term bond comparisons, may conclude that the ten-year comparison standing alone is not misleading at all.  Because the district court felt it irrelevant that defendants had not reported the claimed six-year negative trend, it gave no attention to whether the Miller plaintiffs had adequately established a factual base--viz., that defendants knew, or reasonably should have known, of that change of circumstances.  While we have some doubt about the adequacy of the Miller plaintiffs' proof of defendants' knowledge, we nonetheless recognize that discovery on this issue was limited.  We reverse and remand to permit further discovery in this area.  Following such discovery, the court may then reconsider defendants' motion for summary judgment, if defendants choose to renew it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, on the current state of the record in the Miller case, summary judgment on this issue was improper.  We agree with the district court that the ten-year comparison \"paints a much rosier picture,\" New America, 834 F.Supp. at 507, than the six-year comparison.  Having established this fact, the district court erred in concluding in the Miller case that the comparison nonetheless was not misleading as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Other Summary Judgment Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While fact issues remain with regard to the Treasury security comparison in the Miller case, the district court properly granted summary judgment on all other issues in both cases.  For example, plaintiffs alleged that (1) defendants knew or should have known of the effect that \"aging\" calculations have on determining junk bond returns, and (2) defendants should not have used the DBL composite as an indicator of past performance of junk bonds because that composite failed to account for \"forced bond exchanges.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is doubtless true, as plaintiffs allege, that several significant studies with regard to \"aging\" discovered statistical infirmities in the traditional methods of calculating junk bond returns.  However, these studies were completed only after the prospectuses were issued.  Moreover, according to affidavits in the record, the Asquith study was the first study of its kind to display the infirmities of previous calculation methods.  Plaintiffs failed to adduce any facts which, contrary to defendants' affidavits, would tend to show that defendants were aware of these infirmities, or that they could or should have been aware of the effects of \"aging\" analysis at the time the funds were initially offered to the public.  Given plaintiffs' failure to raise a triable issue of fact, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar analysis disposes of plaintiffs' allegation that the DBL composite, relied on extensively by defendants in the prospectuses, failed to account for forced bond exchanges.  Defendants offered affidavits to the effect that forced bond exchanges in fact were accounted for in the DBL composite.  Plaintiffs offer no evidence to the contrary.  Accordingly, we find no error in the district court's grant of summary judgment on this issue.  Because further discovery will occur in the Miller case, we leave to the district court the formulation of the extent of that discovery, consistent with the ruling made herein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, defendant Prudential Bache, an underwriter of the New America Fund, argues that claims against it were untimely filed.  The district court did not rule on when the statute of limitations in this case began to run, nor can we make such a determination on the record before us.  Accordingly, we leave this important procedural issue to be determined in the first instance by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have carefully considered all other arguments and find them to be either waived or without merit.  For the foregoing reasons, the various orders of the district court are</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in full as to the Lucia case, and, as to the Miller case, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The results of the Asquith study were first made public through various financial and general periodicals in April of 1989.

As the affidavit of Professor Asquith points out, however, this method loses its accuracy in a rapidly expanding market, such as the junk bond market of the 1970's and '80's, where new issues greatly enlarged the existing market.  In other words, the traditional method does not reveal whether a preponderance of older or newer issues are defaulting in a given year</p>\n        <p>Breaking from the traditional method of calculation, Asquith's study tracked the default rate of bonds based on their dates of issuance.  The study revealed that junk bonds become more likely to default as they grow older, hence the term \"aging.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Sections 10(b), 11 and 12(2) all prohibit the use of materially misleading information in the sale of securities, and the same conduct may be actionable under all three sections.

The DBL composite measures the performance of the most representative bonds in the \"high yield\" market and is compiled monthly by Drexel Burnham Lambert Incorporated.  As of December 31, 1987, the DBL Composite offered a yield spread of 484 basis points (i.e., 4.84%;  1% equals 100 basis points) over the comparable Treasury security, 7% U.S. Treasury due 1994.  U.S. Treasury securities are considered to have minimal risk.  The average spread between the DBL Composite and the comparable U.S. Treasury issue was 358 basis points for 1980, 397 basis points for 1981, 503 basis points for 1982, 337 basis points for 1983, 311 basis points for 1984, 362 basis points for 1985, 496 basis points for 1986 and 451 basis points for 1987.</p>\n        <p>For the years 1977 through 1986, the spread in yields between \"high yield\" securities and representative U.S. Treasury securities has averaged approximately 393 basis points.  For this period, the loss in principal and interest due to defaults on \"high yield\" securities has averaged approximately 97 basis points.  Thus, for the period 1977 to 1986, the net average spread between \"high yield\" securities and representative U.S. Treasury securities (i.e., the average spread between \"high yield\" securities and U.S. Treasury securities, minus the average default loss on \"high yield\" securities) was 296 basis points.  For 1987, the loss of principal and interest due to defaults is estimated to have been 125 basis points.*   However, past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance....</p>\n        <p>The capital structure of the Fund has been designed to take advantage of the historical spread in yields between \"high yield\" securities and representative U.S. Treasury securities, compared with the average default loss on \"high yield\" securities.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">*</a>\n        <p> Statistical data appearing above are based on information provided by Drexel Burnham Lambert Incorporated.</p>\n        <p>The Prospect Street prospectus is similarly structured and worded.</p>\n        <p>We note in passing that the Prospect Street prospectus reports significantly different annual spreads for the years 1980 through 1987.

Each fund's purpose, as stated in their nearly identical prospectuses, was to invest in a diversified portfolio of high yield fixed-income securities, commonly known as \"junk bonds.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1989, well after the initial public offerings, a study headed by Professor Paul Asquith (\"the Asquith study\") disclosed that the default rate of junk bonds was much higher than had been previously believed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  This conclusion was reached by calculating the adverse effects of \"aging\" on junk bonds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within months of the study, though not necessarily as a direct result of the study, the market for junk bonds began to collapse.

The First Amended Complaints (hereinafter \"the original complaints\") were lengthy, alleging violations of a variety of federal securities laws, including section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78j(b), and sections 11 and 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. Secs. 77k, 77l(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The gist of the original complaints was that the funds' directors, advisors and underwriters (\"defendants\") knew of, but failed to disclose, adverse information about the junk bond market.  In particular, the complaints alleged that defendants had agreed to act, and had in fact acted, as purchasers of last resort for undesirable junk bonds;  that they knew of infirmities in the junk bond market at the time they publicly offered shares of the funds and thereafter;  and that misleading statistics were used in the prospectuses to portray the historical performance of junk bonds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed many of plaintiffs' claims on the pleadings, see Miller v.

All section 10(b) claims presented in the original complaints were dropped.

The common thread running throughout the original complaints, however, was that defendants knew of infirmities in the junk bond market, and that they nonetheless entered a vast web of illicit agreements with Drexel Burnham Lambert, and with former junk bond dealer Michael Milken, in order to become purchasers of last resort for undesirable junk bonds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court properly concluded that these general allegations in the original complaints were wholly conclusory.  No factual basis is put forward to support plaintiffs' theory that defendants consorted with Drexel, that they dealt with Michael Milken, that they agreed to act as purchasers of last resort for undesirable bonds, or that they knew enough to anticipate the impending fall-out of the junk bond market.  Because all of plaintiffs' 10(b) claims rely fundamentally on such unsupported allegations, the district court properly dismissed these claims for failure to meet Rule 9(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Cf. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558579\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Romani,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/558579/richard-romani-v-shearson-lehman-hutton/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">878</span> </a></span>(finding that complaint failed to satisfy Rule 9(b) where it contained \"no factual allegations that would support a reasonable inference that adverse circumstances existed at the time of the offering, and were known and deliberately or recklessly disregarded by defendants\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

And the Miller plaintiffs, unlike the Lucia plaintiffs, in their response to defendants' motion for summary judgment, set forth facts showing that the six-year figure, as well as a shorter three-year figure, actually favored Treasury securities.  Moreover, the district court squarely addressed this argument in ruling on the Miller defendants' motion for summary judgment.  See In re New Am.  High Income Fund Sec. Litig., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></span>, 506-07 (D.Mass.1993).

In fact, the Lucia plaintiffs' opposition to defendants' summary judgment motion fails to even mention the six-year comparison.  Despite the striking similarities in these two cases, the Lucia plaintiffs pursued a significantly different tack in opposing defendants' motion for summary judgment, and failed to argue that the Prospect Street prospectus was misleading due to its failure to include a shorter-term comparison to Treasury securities.  As noted above, a nonmovant faced with a motion for summary judgment may not rest on its pleadings.

We begin by noting that the six years at issue are the six years leading up to the fund's public offering.  Moreover, while any one or two years might favor Treasury securities without amounting to an unfavorable trend, we think that a six-year comparison favoring Treasury securities is substantial enough to cast some doubt on the reliability of the reported ten-year figure.  In other words, we cannot say as a matter of law that the undisclosed information about the six-year period would not alter the total mix of facts available to the investor.  Rather, a jury could find that there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider the six-year comparison important to the investment decision.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581509\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Milton,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/581509/fed-sec-l-rep-p-96601-james-w-milton-v-van-dorn-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">969</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We expressly decline to make hard and fast rules about the time length of reported investment results, i.e., we do not hold that ten-year comparisons must always be accompanied by shorter-term comparisons.  Nor do we hold that a plaintiff always creates a triable issue of fact by merely unearthing unfavorable news regarding shorter time intervals than those reported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the unfavorable six-year figure in this case does not necessarily render the ten-year comparison misleading.  Rather, a jury, knowing the individual annual returns over the ten-year period at issue (which are not now ascertainable on the record before us) and perhaps having other guideposts for determining the relative reliability of shorter- and longer-term bond comparisons, may conclude that the ten-year comparison standing alone is not misleading at all.  Because the district court felt it irrelevant that defendants had not reported the claimed six-year negative trend, it gave no attention to whether the Miller plaintiffs had adequately established a factual base--viz., that defendants knew, or reasonably should have known, of that change of circumstances.  While we have some doubt about the adequacy of the Miller plaintiffs' proof of defendants' knowledge, we nonetheless recognize that discovery on this issue was limited.  We reverse and remand to permit further discovery in this area.  Following such discovery, the court may then reconsider defendants' motion for summary judgment, if defendants choose to renew it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, on the current state of the record in the Miller case, summary judgment on this issue was improper.  We agree with the district court that the ten-year comparison \"paints a much rosier picture,\" New <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">America,</span> <span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">507</span></span>, than the six-year comparison.  Having established this fact, the district court erred in concluding in the Miller case that the comparison nonetheless was not misleading as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Other Summary Judgment Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While fact issues remain with regard to the Treasury security comparison in the Miller case, the district court properly granted summary judgment on all other issues in both cases.  For example, plaintiffs alleged that (1) defendants knew or should have known of the effect that \"aging\" calculations have on determining junk bond returns, and (2) defendants should not have used the DBL composite as an indicator of past performance of junk bonds because that composite failed to account for \"forced bond exchanges.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is doubtless true, as plaintiffs allege, that several significant studies with regard to \"aging\" discovered statistical infirmities in the traditional methods of calculating junk bond returns.  However, these studies were completed only after the prospectuses were issued.  Moreover, according to affidavits in the record, the Asquith study was the first study of its kind to display the infirmities of previous calculation methods.  Plaintiffs failed to adduce any facts which, contrary to defendants' affidavits, would tend to show that defendants were aware of these infirmities, or that they could or should have been aware of the effects of \"aging\" analysis at the time the funds were initially offered to the public.  Given plaintiffs' failure to raise a triable issue of fact, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar analysis disposes of plaintiffs' allegation that the DBL composite, relied on extensively by defendants in the prospectuses, failed to account for forced bond exchanges.  Defendants offered affidavits to the effect that forced bond exchanges in fact were accounted for in the DBL composite.  Plaintiffs offer no evidence to the contrary.  Accordingly, we find no error in the district court's grant of summary judgment on this issue.  Because further discovery will occur in the Miller case, we leave to the district court the formulation of the extent of that discovery, consistent with the ruling made herein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, defendant Prudential Bache, an underwriter of the New America Fund, argues that claims against it were untimely filed.  The district court did not rule on when the statute of limitations in this case began to run, nor can we make such a determination on the record before us.  Accordingly, we leave this important procedural issue to be determined in the first instance by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have carefully considered all other arguments and find them to be either waived or without merit.  For the foregoing reasons, the various orders of the district court are</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in full as to the Lucia case, and, as to the Miller case, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The results of the Asquith study were first made public through various financial and general periodicals in April of 1989.

Times, Apr. 10, 1989, at D9;  Linda Sandler &amp; Michael Siconolfi, Junk Bonds are Taking Their Lumps, Wall St. J., Apr. 14, 1989, at C1.  The study itself was not published until September 1989.

As the affidavit of Professor Asquith points out, however, this method loses its accuracy in a rapidly expanding market, such as the junk bond market of the 1970's and '80's, where new issues greatly enlarged the existing market.  In other words, the traditional method does not reveal whether a preponderance of older or newer issues are defaulting in a given year</p>\n        <p>Breaking from the traditional method of calculation, Asquith's study tracked the default rate of bonds based on their dates of issuance.  The study revealed that junk bonds become more likely to default as they grow older, hence the term \"aging.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Sections 10(b), 11 and 12(2) all prohibit the use of materially misleading information in the sale of securities, and the same conduct may be actionable under all three sections.

The DBL composite measures the performance of the most representative bonds in the \"high yield\" market and is compiled monthly by Drexel Burnham Lambert Incorporated.  As of December 31, 1987, the DBL Composite offered a yield spread of 484 basis points (i.e., 4.84%;  1% equals 100 basis points) over the comparable Treasury security, 7% U.S. Treasury due 1994.  U.S. Treasury securities are considered to have minimal risk.  The average spread between the DBL Composite and the comparable U.S. Treasury issue was 358 basis points for 1980, 397 basis points for 1981, 503 basis points for 1982, 337 basis points for 1983, 311 basis points for 1984, 362 basis points for 1985, 496 basis points for 1986 and 451 basis points for 1987.</p>\n        <p>For the years 1977 through 1986, the spread in yields between \"high yield\" securities and representative U.S. Treasury securities has averaged approximately 393 basis points.  For this period, the loss in principal and interest due to defaults on \"high yield\" securities has averaged approximately 97 basis points.  Thus, for the period 1977 to 1986, the net average spread between \"high yield\" securities and representative U.S. Treasury securities (i.e., the average spread between \"high yield\" securities and U.S. Treasury securities, minus the average default loss on \"high yield\" securities) was 296 basis points.
