Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                                   \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Cyr and Boudin,\r\n                       Circuit Judges.\r                                                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\nJose A.

We affirm  the district  court's order  of\r                           \r\n\nDecember 21, 1994, denying appellant's motion  filed pursuant\r\n\nto 28 U.S.C.    2255.   Appellant has  failed to  demonstrate\r\n\ncause for failing to pursue his timely filed direct  criminal\r\n\nappeal, which was  dismissed for lack of  prosecution.  Since\r\n\nwe conclude  that appellant  lacked cause for  his procedural\r\n\ndefault, we  need not address whether  he suffered prejudice.\r\n\nSee Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 134 n.43 (1982).\r                              \r\n\n     Appellant's  contention  that  he need  not  demonstrate\r\n\ncause  and prejudice for his  default is erroneous  as it has\r\n\nlong been established that \"a collateral challenge may not do\r\n\nservice for an  appeal.\"   United States v.  Frady, 456  U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n152,  165 (1982); see also  Knight v. United  States, 37 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n769, 772-74 (1st Cir. 1994) (applying the cause and prejudice\r\n\nstandard to collateral claims of  constitutional error, apart\r\n\nfrom ineffective  assistance of counsel claim,  not raised on\r\n\ndirect review); Suveges v.  United States, 7 F.3d 6,  10 (1st\r                                                     \r\n\nCir.  1993)  (applying   cause  and  prejudice   standard  to\r\n\ncollateral  claim of  jurisdictional error  in case  where no\r\n\ndirect  appeal was taken).  Nor has appellant come within the\r\n\nnarrow exception  to the  cause and prejudice  requirement by\r\n\nproffering a  claim of  a fundamental miscarriage  of justice\r\n\ntied  to a colorable showing of factual innocence.  See Burks\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Dubois, 55 F.3d 712, 717 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                     \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n     Appellant's claim  that he  let his direct  appeal lapse\r\n\ndue  to his  lack of  resources and  his movement  within the\r\n\nprison system  is belied by the  evidence.  In his  series of\r\n\nfilings  in this  court, appellant informed  us of  his ever-\r\n\nchanging desires.  First, he  expressed his intent to proceed\r\n\npro se.  Ten days later,  he moved for appointed counsel.  We\r\n\ninformed him of the  need to file,  in the district court,  a\r\n\nfinancial affidavit  and  a motion  for leave  to proceed  in\r\n\nforma pauperis (IFP)  on appeal.   Rather than  file for  IFP\r\n\nstatus in the district court, appellant next informed us that\r\n\nhe  wanted  to  withdraw  his appeal  voluntarily.    Shortly\r\n\nthereafter, appellant  stated that he wanted  to continue his\r\n\nappeal and  again requested  appointed counsel.   We reminded\r\n\nappellant that, in order for us to appoint counsel, he needed\r\n\nto  file  his  IFP  motion  and  financial  affidavit in  the\r\n\ndistrict  court.   He  never did.    Rather, in  the district\r\n\ncourt, he  was  exhorting that  court  to decide  some  post-\r\n\nconviction motions  he had filed there because if he obtained\r\n\nthe  requested relief, he would not need to pursue his direct\r\n\nappeal.  District Court docket #187a.\r\n\n     Appellant was aware of what he had to do in order to get\r\n\nappointed  counsel, but never did it.  Moreover, he also knew\r\n\nthat he could proceed pro  se, if he chose.  The  pendency of\r\n\nhis direct appeal was  marked by his own inability  to decide\r\n\nwhat he  wanted  to  do: proceed  pro  se,  obtain  appointed\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ncounsel, or withdraw his  appeal.  All of these  options were\r\n\nfirst proffered as his choice, then aborted by his own action\r\n\nor inaction.  His final choice  was to do nothing and let the\r\n\nappeal be dismissed for lack of prosecution.\r\n\n     Nor  was  his procedural  default  due  to his  movement\r\n\nwithin  the prison system.   His movement did  not impair his\r\n\nability to  correspond with  this court  (or for that  matter\r\n\nwith  the district  court).   Each time  appellant complained\r\n\nthat  his  mail  from this  court  had  been  delayed and  he\r\n\nrequested an enlargement  of time  to file  his statement  of\r\n\nissues and/or his  brief, he  received one.   And, while  his\r\n\ndirect appeal was pending,  appellant filed numerous  motions\r\n\nand  requests in  the district  court, including  six motions\r\n\nseeking  reconsideration of  his sentence  and an  additional\r\n\nmotion asking  that  the  time  he spent  on  release  before\r\n\nsentencing   be  credited  towards  his  incarceration  time.\r\n\nClearly, appellant's procedural default of his direct  appeal\r\n\nwas a conscious choice that was not due either to his lack of\r\n\nresources or his movement among prisons.\r\n\n     On appeal, appellant raises,  for the first time, claims\r\n\nof ineffective assistance of counsel.  A claim neither raised\r\n\nin the    2255 motion nor  argued in the district  court will\r\n\nnot  be reviewed on appeal.   Singleton v.  United States, 26\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d  233, 240  (1st  Cir.), cert.  denied,  115 S.
