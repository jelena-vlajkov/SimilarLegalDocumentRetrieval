The  district  court\n\nultimately  ruled that  the  dispute was  subject to  arbitration\n\nbecause no slowdown  occurred.  We affirm on the  ground that the\n\nunderlying contract dispute addressed  by the district court must\n\nbe submitted to arbitration in accordance with the CBA. \n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          BFI  operates  a  waste  disposal facility  in  Cata o,\n\nPuerto Rico.

After   BFI  dismissed  four  employees  for\n\nallegedly   participating  in  a  \"slowdown\"  prohibited  by  CBA\n\n  15.01,1  the  Union  initiated grievance  proceedings  on their\n\n                    \n\n     1CBA   15.01 provides:\n\n          Neither  the  Union  nor   employees  covered\n          herein  shall at  any  time, including  lunch\n          hour, call, cause, sanction,  participate in,\n          permit, authorize, honor, instigate, support,\n          assist  or  condone   any  strike,   sympathy\n          strike, work stoppage, picketing, slowdown or\n          other concerted and/or intentional  effort to\n\n                                2\n\nbehalf pursuant to the contract arbitration  clause, CBA   11.01.\n\nBFI in turn commenced the present action to stay arbitration, see\n                                                                 \n\nLabor  Management Relations  Act    301(a),  29 U.S.C.    185(a),\n\nclaiming  that  CBA    15.02   expressly  exempts  BFI's  adverse\n\nemployment   action  from  contract   grievance  and  arbitration\n\nprocedures.  \n\n          BFI promptly  moved for summary judgment  on the ground\n\nthat the discharged employees had engaged in an action prohibited\n\nby CBA   15.01, but the district court ruled that a genuine issue\n\nof material fact remained as to whether the employees had engaged\n\nin a \"slowdown,\"  and referred the matter to  a magistrate-judge.\n\nFollowing   an   evidentiary   hearing,    the   magistrate-judge\n\nrecommended that the district  court find that BFI had  failed to\n\nprove a \"slowdown,\"  and further recommended that  the dispute be\n\nsubmitted  to  arbitration.    The  district  court  adopted  the\n\nmagistrate-judge's  report and  recommendation over  BFI's timely\n\nobjection, and dismissed the action.

The  first  clause\n\nconditions the employer's right to take disciplinary action under\n\n                                4\n\nsection 15.02 on the occurrence of  an employee action prohibited\n\nby section 15.01;  the last clause  makes it clear that  the only\n\nemployer action exempted from grievance and arbitration under CBA\n\n  11.01 is  a disciplinary  action  against an  employee who  has\n\nviolated section 15.01.  \n\n          The  interpretation  advanced  by  BFI  disregards  the\n\nentire first clause in section 15.02, see Jimenez v. Peninsular &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nOriental Steam Nav.

Doubts should be resolved in favor\n\nof  coverage.'\"   AT&amp;T  Technologies, 475  U.S.  at 650  (quoting\n                                    \n\nSteelworkers v. Warrior  &amp; Gulf  Nav.

In this case, we  could not say with  any assurance at\n                                                    \n\nall  that  section  15.02  permits  the  employer  to  determine,\n\nunilaterally  and  conclusively,  that  section  15.01  has  been\n\nviolated by the employee.  \n\n          Finally, the interpretation proposed by  BFI would lead\n\nto the absurd result that any employee could be discharged at any\n                                                                 \n\ntime,  with no  right  of recourse  to  grievance or  arbitration\n              \n\nprocedures, simply  on the employer's \"say-so\"  that the employee\n\nhad  engaged  in   conduct  prohibited  by  section  15.01.    An\n\ninterpretation so at odds with the role  of collective bargaining\n\nin labor-management  relations would  give us serious  pause even\n\nassuming  some  plausible   textual  basis   in  the   collective\n\nbargaining  agreement.   The  utter  absence  of textual  support\n\nagreeably precludes any interpretive quandary. \n\n          For the foregoing reasons,  the district court order is\n\naffirmed.\naffirmed\n        \n\n                                6\n",

The  district  court  adopted  the\n\nmagistrate-judge's  report and  recommendation over  BFI's timely\n\nobjection, and dismissed the action.   On appeal, BFI  challenges\n\nthe district court order  directing that the contract dispute  be\n\nsubmitted to arbitration. \n\n                    \n\n          interfere with  production, such as,  but not\n          limited  to, an  extension  of lunch  or rest\n          periods or meetings during working hours.\n\n                                3\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          Whether a collective bargaining agreement  requires the\n\nparties to arbitrate a particular dispute is a matter of contract\n\ninterpretation  entrusted in  the first  instance to  trial court\n\ndetermination, AT&amp;T  Technologies   v.
