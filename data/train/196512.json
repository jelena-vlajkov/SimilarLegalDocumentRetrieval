His\r\n\nsection 1983  claim charged  that  prosecutor Sydney  Hanlon,\r\n\ndefense counsel Judd Carhart, court officer Robert Craig, and\r\n\ncourt  reporter   George  Criss   conspired  to   ensure  his\r\n\nconviction by  unconstitutional means  and to cover  up their\r\n\nmisconduct  by  withholding,  losing  or   altering  critical\r\n\ntranscripts.    We  affirm  the  district  court's  dismissal\r\n\nruling,  in accordance with Heck v. Humphrey, 114 S.

See  Abella, 63\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d at 1064; Boyd, 31 F.3d at 282 n.2.\r                              \r\n\n          Since  Craig  and Criss  had  defaulted  before the\r\n\ndistrict  court  dismissed   the  present  action,  Rodriguez\r\n\nargues, citing Quirindongo Pacheco v. Rolon Morales, 953 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n15  (1st Cir. 1992), that  he should have  been notified that\r\n\nthe court intended to review the sufficiency of the complaint\r\n\nagainst those  defendants.   Unlike in the  Quirindongo case,\r                                                                   \r\n\nid. at  16, neither prior  notice nor an  evidentiary hearing\r              \r\n\nwould  have  been useful  to  Rodriguez  since Heck  required\r                                                               \r\n\ndismissal of the damages claim as a matter of law.  \r\n\n          Rodriguez argues  that the claim  against the court\r\n\nreporter should not have  been dismissed, because the failure\r\n\nto deliver accurate transcripts was a  \"subissue\" in the case\r\n\nand  he  cannot  overturn  his  conviction  without  accurate\r\n\ntranscripts.1    Because  Rodriguez alleged  that  the  court\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1Rodriguez may be suggesting that the delay in providing\r\ntranscripts violates his due process right to a speedy appeal\r\nand that such  a claim  should not be  dismissed under  Heck.\r                                                                        \r\nSee,  e.g., Harris v.

See Sutton v.

Consequently,  Heck\r                                                                         \r\n\napplies.  \r\n\n          Since   the   Rodriguez   conspiracy   claim   also\r\n\nchallenges  the validity  of  his conviction,  the claim  for\r\n\ndeclaratory  relief  was properly  dismissed  as  well.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nAbella,  63  F.3d  at  1066  (dismissing  Bivens  action  for\r                                                            \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1142, 1158  (1st Cir.  1995) (analyzing merits  of underlying\r\nappeal from conviction to determine prejudice  resulting from\r\nappellate  delay).    Because  this claim  was  not  squarely\r\npresented  to  the district  court,  we  deem it  waived  for\r\npresent purposes.   See  United States v.  Ocasio-Rivera, 991\r                                                                    \r\nF.2d 1,  3 (1st Cir. 1993).   Yet another hurdle  may loom in\r\nthe path of any  section 1983 claim for damages based on such\r\na  speedy-appeal claim.    It may  well  be that  Parratt  v.\r                                                                     \r\nTaylor, 451 U.S. 527, 541-44 (1981), would be implicated were\r                  \r\nit  to appear  that  Massachusetts law  affords Rodriguez  an\r\nadequate   post-deprivation   remedy.      See   Campiti   v.\r                                                                    \r\nCommonwealth, 630 N.E.2d 596, 598 (Mass. 1994).  \r                        \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ndeclaratory   relief   against   defendants,  who   allegedly\r\n\nconspired to convict plaintiff,  on ground that habeas relief\r\n\nis exclusive remedy,  per Preiser v.

Moreover, the claim for  injunctive relief against\r\n\nthe  court reporter is moot  since it is  undisputed that the\r\n\nsuppression hearing tape had been lost and that the defendant\r                                    \r\n\ncourt  reporter turned the voir  dire hearing tape  over to a\r                                                              \r\n\ndifferent  court  reporter  who  prepared  and  delivered  to\r\n\nRodriguez a transcript based on the latter tape.

His section 1983 claim charged that prosecutor Sydney Hanlon, defense counsel Judd Carhart, court officer Robert Craig, and court reporter George Criss conspired to ensure his conviction by unconstitutional means and to cover up their misconduct by withholding, losing or altering critical transcripts.  We affirm the district court's dismissal ruling, in accordance with Heck v. Humphrey, 114 S.Ct. 2364 (1994), but remand to permit entry of a judgment of dismissal, without prejudice.

Unlike in the Quirindongo case, id. at 16, neither prior notice nor an evidentiary hearing would have been useful to Rodriguez since Heck required dismissal of the damages claim as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez argues that the claim against the court reporter should not have been dismissed, because the failure to deliver accurate transcripts was a \"subissue\" in the case and he cannot overturn his conviction without accurate transcripts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Because Rodriguez alleged that the court reporter conspired with the other defendants to withhold, lose or alter transcripts necessary to show that his conviction is invalid, he is, in essence, challenging his conviction.  See Sutton v. Lash, 576 F.2d 738, 746 (7th Cir.1978) (per curiam) (retrial is proper remedy for claimed loss of critical transcripts which preclude meaningful criminal appeal);  see also Wilcox v. Miller, 691 F.2d 739, 741 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir.1982) (claim that defendants in civil suit conspired to alter criminal trial transcripts to assure an affirmance of civil plaintiff's criminal conviction on appeal \"would seem\" to challenge validity of criminal conviction);  accord Tedford v. Hepting, 990 F.2d 745 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct. 317 (1993) (similar).  Consequently, Heck applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the Rodriguez conspiracy claim also challenges the validity of his conviction, the claim for declaratory relief was properly dismissed as well.  See Abella, 63 F.3d at 1066 (dismissing Bivens action for declaratory relief against defendants, who allegedly conspired to convict plaintiff, on ground that habeas relief is exclusive remedy, per Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475 (1973)).  Moreover, the claim for injunctive relief against the court reporter is moot since it is undisputed that the suppression hearing tape had been lost and that the defendant court reporter turned the voir dire hearing tape over to a different court reporter who prepared and delivered to Rodriguez a transcript based on the latter tape.  See DeLancy v. Caldwell, 741 F.2d 1246, 1247 (10th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (Sec. 1983 claim for injunctive relief directing preparation of trial transcripts mooted because defendant had provided transcripts to plaintiff after suit was filed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the premature section 1983 claims were properly dismissed, we direct that the district court judgment be modified so as to dismiss both the section 1983 claims and the pendent state-law claims against all defendants, without prejudice.

See, e.g., Harris v. Champion, 51 F.3d 901, 906, 909 (10th Cir.1995) (considering Sec. 1983 claim for money damages alleging excessive delay in processing direct criminal appeals);  but see United States v. Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d 1142, 1158 (1st Cir.1995) (analyzing merits of underlying appeal from conviction to determine prejudice resulting from appellate delay).  Because this claim was not squarely presented to the district court, we deem it waived for present purposes.  See United States v. Ocasio-Rivera, 991 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1993).  Yet another hurdle may loom in the path of any section 1983 claim for damages based on such a speedy-appeal claim.  It may well be that Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 541-44 (1981), would be implicated were it to appear that Massachusetts law affords Rodriguez an adequate post-deprivation remedy.  See Campiti v.
