The earlier proceedings are reported in United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Saccoccia, 58  F.3d 754 (1st Cir. 1995), and  United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nHurley,    F.3d      (1st Cir. 1995) [Nos. 93-1511,  93-1560, 93-\r                \r\n\n1561, 93-1562,  93-1563, 93-1616, 93-1617,  93-2006, 93-2207, 94-\r\n\n1388, 94-1507, 94-1508 (1st Cir. July 20, 1995)].  After Gabriele\r\n\nwas indicted for alleged  participation in the Saccoccia criminal\r\n\nenterprise, he stipulated to the facts established by the govern-\r\n\nment at  the two earlier  trials involving Stephen  Saccoccia and\r\n\nhis  codefendants.   We  relate only  the background  information\r\n\nmaterial to Gabriele's involvement in the criminal enterprise.\r\n\n          The  money  laundering  operation primarily  functioned\r\n\nthrough precious  metals companies  controlled  by Saccoccia  and\r\n\nlocated  in Los Angeles, New  York, and Rhode  Island.  Colombian\r\n\ndrug dealers transferred huge  sums to the Saccoccia organization\r\n\nfor laundering.  Employing  various techniques, such as purchases\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nof gold  and cashier's  checks, the Saccoccia  organization laun-\r\n\ndered  the  drug monies  and  funneled  laundered funds  back  to\r\n\nColombia by circuitous techniques (e.g.,  multiple wire transfers\r\n\nand  interstate transportation).  Some  of the gold was delivered\r\n\nto Recovery Technologies, Inc.  (\"RTI\"), a precious metals dealer\r\n\nlocated  in Attleboro, Massachusetts, and controlled and operated\r\n\nby Gabriele.  The gold was kept in a safe  purchased by Saccoccia\r\n\nand  installed  at RTI  with Gabriele's  consent.   At  one point\r\n\nGabriele prophetically observed in  relation to the gold deliver-\r\n\nies:   \"Steve  [Saccoccia] is going  to put  us all  in jail some\r\n\nday.\"\r\n\n          In the summer of  1991, after learning that two  of his\r\n\nRhode Island  companies were  under FBI video  surveillance, Sac-\r\n\ncoccia  pointed out  the concealed  surveillance cameras  to Gab-\r\n\nriele.  Shortly thereafter,  Saccoccia announced his intention to\r\n\nacquire RTI from  Gabriele and  hired Gabriele  as his  employee.\r\n\nSaccoccia then began to divert to RTI the cash and gold shipments\r\n\nwhich could no  longer be  delivered undetected to  the two  Sac-\r\n\ncoccia companies.\r\n\n          The deliveries  to  RTI  were  monitored  by  Saccoccia\r\n\nemployees.   Among the persons at RTI, Gabriele alone knew about,\r\n\nand participated in  counting, the cash  and gold shipments  from\r\n\nSaccoccia.  The  shipments to  RTI were recorded  by Gabriele  in\r\n\ncoded  language.   The coded  records were  kept in  the  desk in\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nGabriele's private office, separate  from all other RTI records.1\r\n\nDuring this period, Gabriele  again voiced concern that Saccoccia\r\n\n\"is going to put us all in jail.\"  \r\n\n          From time  to  time Saccoccia  instructed  Gabriele  to\r\n\ntransfer the large sums of cash kept in the RTI safe.  On various\r\n\noccasions Gabriele wired funds to designated banks at Saccoccia's\r\n\ndirection or turned over funds directly to Saccoccia couriers who\r\n\nhad been told to leave cash  amounts for Gabriele.  Saccoccia and\r\n\nGabriele  discussed their  ongoing cash  transactions in  a coded\r\n\nconversation intercepted by the FBI in October 1991. \r\n\n          In due course, Gabriele was indicted on a RICO conspir-\r\n\nacy  charge,  along with  Saccoccia  and  others, and  separately\r\n\ncharged  with engaging  in eight monetary  transactions involving\r\n\ncriminally  derived  property.    A jury  convicted  him  of RICO\r\n\nconspiracy and six monetary transaction charges.2 \r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The secret records kept by Gabriele related also to the so-\r\ncalled Saccoccia \"pool account\" at RTI.  Normally, RTI would sell\r\ngold  for a client,  place the proceeds in  the pool account, and\r\nimmediately  wire the funds directly  to the client.   The secret\r\npool  account records  revealed, however,  that the  proceeds due\r\nSaccoccia remained in RTI's bank account for much  longer periods\r\nof time, awaiting  Saccoccia's instructions to wire the  funds   \r\nfrequently to third parties.\r\n\n     2At trial,  Gabriele contended  that Saccoccia,  a long-time\r\nRTI client, had been allowed to keep cash in the RTI safe because\r\nthe security  systems at Saccoccia's Rhode  Island companies were\r\ntemporarily  off-line, and  that  the large  amounts  of cash  he\r\nhandled for Saccoccia  were not uncommon  in the precious  metals\r\nindustry.  He maintained  that the intercepted conversations were\r\ninconclusive  and  that  the  inculpatory  testimony  from  other\r\nSaccoccia employees was unreliable.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          Gabriele takes  the district  court to task  on several\r\n\nrulings, which we discuss in turn.  \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nA.  Section 1957\r          A.  Section 1957\r                          \r\n\n     1. Mens Rea\r               1. Mens Rea\r                          \r\n\n          First,  he  claims  that  the mens  rea  element  under\r                                                           \r\n\nsection 1957 is unconstitutionally  vague, see, e.g., Kolender v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nLawson, 461 U.S.  352, 357  (1983), and that  the district  court\r                \r\n\ntherefore  erred in  denying his  pretrial motion to  dismiss the\r\n\nsection 1957 charges.  The  crux of the argument is  that section\r\n\n1957 is a rather  novel statute, in that it  criminalizes conduct\r\n\nby a person  once removed from  that of the person  who generated\r\n\nthe criminally derived property.  Thus, he argues, the proscribed\r\n\nconduct  is not likely to appear unlawful to an ordinary citizen.\r\n\n          Second,  he contends  that section 1957  is unconstitu-\r\n\ntional  on its face, in that it chills legitimate business trans-\r\n\nactions because a prudent business person could never be sure how\r\n\nmany suspicion-arousing \"red  flags\" would  be enough  to lead  a\r\n\njury to  infer that the  person \"knew\" that a  client or customer\r\n\nwas engaged in criminal activity.  Alternatively he suggests that\r\n\npersons engaged in  honest business dealings  would be forced  to\r\n\nrely  on  racial or  ethnic stereotyping,  as  by refusing  to do\r\n\nbusiness with \"known\" criminals.  \r\n\n          Section  1957(a) prohibits  \"knowingly engag[ing]  in a\r\n\nmonetary transaction in criminally derived property that  is of a\r\n\nvalue greater than $10,000 and is derived from specified unlawful\r\n\nactivity .  .  . .\"  18 U.S.C.    1957(a).   \"Criminally  derived\r\n\nproperty\" is  \"any property  constituting, or derived  from, pro-\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nceeds obtained from a  criminal offense.\"   Id.   1957(f)(2).   A\r                                                         \r\n\ndefendant may  not be convicted  under section 1957(a)  unless he\r\n\nknew that the transaction involved \"criminally derived\" property,\r\n\nid.    1957(c),  but  he need  not  have known  that  the subject\r             \r\n\nproperty was derived from \"specified unlawful activity,\" id.  The\r                                                                      \r\n\ndenial  of  a  pretrial motion  to  dismiss  criminal  charges is\r\n\nreviewed de novo.   See  United States  v. Aguilar-Aranceta,  957\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d 18, 21 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 105 (1992).   \r                                              \r\n\n          First, given  the prominent  \"red flags\"  that signaled\r\n\nthe criminal  nature of the Saccoccia  money laundering operation\r\n\nto Gabriele  (e.g.,  knowledge of  government surveillance;  eva-\r\n\nsionary  tactics; large volumes of secreted cash), as well as the\r\n\nstrong evidence of  Gabriele's mens rea  (\"some day Stephen  Sac-\r                                                 \r\n\ncoccia  is going to  put us all in  jail\"), the instant constitu-\r\n\ntional  challenge to  the \"knowledge\"  requirement under  section\r\n\n1987 has the ring of desperation.  See United States v. Baker, 19\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 605,  614 (11th Cir. 1994)  (rejecting comparable as-applied\r\n\nchallenge to   1957).\r\n\n          Second, the facial challenge  to the statute is without\r\n\npersuasive force.  Section  1957 is but another in  a substantial\r\n\nline of federal criminal statutes whose only mens rea requirement\r                                                               \r\n\nis \"knowledge\"  of the  prior criminal  conduct that tainted  the\r\n\nproperty involved  in  the proscribed  activity.   See, e.g.,  18\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.C.   2312  (prohibiting interstate transportation of  automo-\r\n\nbiles \"knowing  the  same to  be  stolen\");     2313  (same,  for\r\n\nreceipt of  such automobiles);    2314 (criminalizing  interstate\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\ntransportation of goods  \"knowing the same  to have been  stolen,\r\n\nconverted, or taken by fraud\").  Thus, Gabriele's policy argument\r\n\nreduces to an attempt  to second-guess the congressional decision\r\n\nto criminalize a particular type of \"knowing\" conduct. \r\n\n          Gabriele further  claims that the  district court erred\r\n\nin rejecting proposed jury instructions defining the section 1957\r\n\n\"knowledge\"  element  with greater  precision.3   As  he  did not\r\n\nadequately renew his objections  to the charge prior to  the time\r\n\nthe jury  retired to  deliberate,  see Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 30,  we\r                                                \r\n\nreview for plain error.  See  United States v. O'Connor, 28  F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n218, 220-21 (1st Cir. 1994).4  \r\n\n          The district  court carefully instructed  the jury that\r\n\nGabriele could not be convicted unless he \"knew that the money or\r\n\nproperty involved  in [the  particular] monetary transaction  was\r\n\nobtained from  the proceeds of  some criminal offense,\"  and that\r\n\nthe  \"knowledge\" element  was not  met merely  by a  finding that\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3Gabriele requested instructions (i) defining \"knowing\" as a\r\n\"clear  and  certain perception  of fact  or  truth,\" not  a mere\r\nsuspicion, Request No.  18; (ii) that he had no  duty to investi-\r\ngate the  legality of the  Saccoccia enterprise, Request  No. 19;\r\nand (iii) that  he could not  be convicted unless the  jury found\r\nthat  he knew  it was  a criminal offense  to engage  in monetary\r\ntransactions  in  criminally  derived property,  Request  No. 18A\r\n(citing Cheek v. United States, 498 U.S. 192 (1991)).  \r                                        \r\n\n     4Gabriele  did not  object to  the definition  of \"knowing,\"\r\nfollowing the  jury charge.    See supra  note  3.   Although  he\r                                                  \r\nclearly delineated  the grounds  for objecting to  numerous other\r\njury instructions,  see infra  Section II.B.2, he  simply renewed\r                                       \r\nhis objections to Requests 18A  and 19 by reference.  See  O'Con-\r                                                                           \r\nnor, 28  F.3d at 221 (under Fed. R. Crim.

Our\r\n\nreview  confirms  that  the  district court  instruction  in  all\r\n\nrespects  delineated  the  appropriate  \"knowledge\"  element  for\r\n\napplication by  the jury.  See  United States v.  Noone, 913 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n20, 30 (1st Cir. 1990) (refusal to give requested instruction not\r\n\nreversible error  if instruction given was  substantially correct\r\n\nand substantially covered defendant's request), cert. denied, 500\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 906 (1991).5\r\n\n          Finally, Gabriele contends that the jury instruction on\r\n\n\"willful blindness\" was  error.6  Since the government adduced no\r\n\nevidence that Gabriele had engaged in any  particular conduct for\r\n\nthe  purpose of  precluding his  acquisition of  actual knowledge\r\n\nthat  Saccoccia  was  engaged in  unlawful  activities,  Gabriele\r\n\nargues  that  the  \"willful  blindness\"  instruction  necessarily\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Since the   1957 mens rea requirement includes no  \"wilful-\r                                         \r\nness\"  element, a Cheek instruction, see supra note 3, would have\r                                                        \r\nbeen improper  as a matter of law.  See United States v. Brandon,\r                                                                          \r\n17 F.3d 409,  448 (1st Cir.)

It's important,\r                                                          \r\nhowever,  to  bear in  mind that  mere  negligence or  mistake in\r\nfailing to learn a fact is not sufficient.\" (Emphasis added.) \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nsuggested that the jury could convict if it found that he \"should\r\n\nhave known\" that  the gold  and cash he  received from  Saccoccia\r\n\nderived  from criminal activity.  Once again, we review for plain\r\n\nerror.7   \r\n\n          A willful blindness instruction is warranted if (1) the\r\n\ndefendant  claims  lack  of  knowledge; (2)  the  evidence  would\r\n\nsupport an inference that the defendant  consciously engaged in a\r\n\ncourse of deliberate ignorance; and (3) the proposed instruction,\r\n\nas a whole, could not lead the jury to conclude that an inference\r\n\nof knowledge was  mandatory.

Whether or  not RTI was  part of  the RICO  enterprise,\r\n\nthere  was ample  evidence from  which the  jury could  find that\r\n\nGabriele \"participated\" as a  Saccoccia employee who was \"plainly\r\n\nintegral to carrying out\"  the enterprise even though he  did not\r\n\n\"direct\" its operations.  Id.\r                                       \r\n\n          Request  No.  9  proposed  to instruct  the  jury  that\r\n\nGabriele's commission of two  predicate acts, without more, would\r                                                                    \r\n\nnot establish his  agreement to \"participate\" in the  RICO enter-\r\n\nprise.  Request No. 12 would have precluded conviction unless the\r\n\njury  found that  Gabriele  \"knew of  the conspiracy's  essential\r\n\nfeatures, general scope, and overall goals.\"  These requests were\r\n\nsubstantially  covered  by  the  final  charge,  which repeatedly\r\n\nreminded the  jury that  acquittal was  required unless it  found\r\n\nthat Gabriele \"under[stood] the unlawful nature of  the plan\" and\r\n\nentered into  a \"mutual  agreement\" to accomplish  \"some unlawful\r\n\npurpose.\"\r\n\n          Request No.  16  stated that  \"a  person who  may  have\r\n\nfurnished  goods, money,  or services  to another  person who  he\r\n\nknows is or  will be engaged in criminal activity  and that these\r\n\ngoods  or  services may  be  used in  that  activity does  not by\r\n\nfurnishing  such goods,  money or  services necessarily  become a\r\n\nmember  of the  conspiracy.\"   See  Direct  Sales Co.  v.

The truism underlying the requested\r                \r\n\ninstruction is  that the seller's mere knowledge of the existence\r\n\nof  a conspiracy is not in itself  sufficient to convict him as a\r\n\nconspirator; the  seller must  also have intended  that the  sale\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\npromote  the unlawful goals of the conspiracy.  See, e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

Nonetheless, as we have noted, the\r                 \r\n\nDirect  Sales Co. instruction  normally is  not essential  if the\r                           \r\n\ntrial  court advises the jury  that the defendant  cannot be con-\r\n\nvicted absent a finding that he joined the conspiracy with intent\r\n\nto  further its unlawful purposes.

To the  extent the request purposed a  \"reasonable doubt\"\r\n\nstandard,  it was  surplusage,  since the  charge delineated  the\r\n\nrequisite elements under section  1962(c) and (d), and repeatedly\r\n\ninstructed the jury that the government had the burden of proving\r\n\neach element beyond  a reasonable  doubt.  See  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nLong, 977 F.2d 1264, 1272 (8th  Cir. 1992) (where lack of  knowl-\r              \r\n\nedge  is defense,  jury instructions  on conspiracy,  intent, and\r\n\nspecific intent  adequately covered  \"theory of  the defense\").12\r\n\nThere was no instructional error relating to the RICO conspiracy.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12Since there was no instructional error, Gabriele's  \"cumu-\r\nlative error\" claim goes nowhere. \r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nC.

Gabriele insists that the jury necessarily drew the\r\n\nimproper  inference that  he would  take the  stand to  \"tell his\r\n\nstory,\" whereas in fact he rightfully elected not to testify.  He\r\n\nadds that the  district court  instruction given in  lieu of  his\r\n\nrequest for  a mistrial was inadequate, because  the court merely\r\n\nnoted that  a defendant  bears no burden  of proof in  a criminal\r\n\ncase, while failing to emphasize that no adverse inference may be\r\n\ndrawn from a defendant's  decision to exercise his constitutional\r\n\nright not to testify at trial.\r\n\n          Whether  a statement  in the  presence of the  jury in-\r\n\nfringed  upon  the  privilege  against  self-incrimination  is  a\r\n\nquestion normally reviewed de novo.  See United States v.

On the other hand, the  denial of a motion for mistrial\r\n\nis  reviewed for  abuse  of discretion.    See United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nRullan-Rivera,      F.3d    ,      (1st Cir. 1995)  [No. 94-1890,\r                       \r\n\n1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 18434, at *4 (1st Cir.

In all\r                                       \r\n\nevents,  we find neither plain  error nor abuse  of discretion in\r\n\nthe denial of the motion for mistrial. \r\n\n          First, the colloquial expression utilized by the  trial\r\n\njudge (\"we will hear the rest of the story\") plainly was intended\r\n\nmerely to inform the  jury that though the government's  case had\r\n\nbeen completed, the  defense    as distinguished from  the defen-\r                                      \r\n\ndant's  testimony     had yet  to be  heard.   Although appellate\r\n\nreview  is plenary,  Glantz, 810 F.2d  at 320  n. 2,  we think it\r                                     \r\n\nwould be imprudent to attribute the more ominous import now urged\r\n\nby Gabriele on  appeal, in light of the  view apparently taken by\r\n\nthe trial  court and counsel at  the time.  See  United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nRobinson,  485  U.S.  25,  30-31 (1988)  (noting,  in  context of\r                  \r\n\nchallenge  to  ambiguous  statements of  prosecutor      arguably\r\n\nconstituting improper  comment on defendant's exercise  of privi-\r\n\nlege against  self-incrimination     \"we  do  not think  that  an\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     13The government argues that  the challenged comment must be\r\nviewed as  innocuous because even the defense  failed to perceive\r                                                                           \r\nthe  statement  as  an  infringement  upon  Gabriele's  privilege\r\nagainst  self-incrimination, as  evidenced by  the fact  that the\r\ndefense  objected solely on the  ground that the  jury might con-\r\nstrue  the statement  as  shifting the  burden  of proof  to  the\r\ndefense.  Gabriele  responds that he delayed his  Fifth Amendment\r\nobjection until  the  defense  rested, because  he  had  not  yet\r\ndecided whether to take the stand.  \r\n     We  think the delay in interposing an objection on the Fifth\r\nAmendment ground effected a waiver.  Whether or not Gabriele ever\r\ntook the stand, the  district court's statement (as construed  by\r\nGabriele)  could have  had a  coercive effect  upon his  decision\r\nwhether  to  testify.   Thus,  had  the  alleged Fifth  Amendment\r\ninfringement been  perceived, it seems  clear that it  would have\r\nbeen more advantageous to raise it before that decision had to be\r                                                   \r\nmade.  \r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\nappellate court may substitute its reading . . . for  that of the\r\n\ntrial court and  counsel\").   Thus, we think  it would amount  to\r\n\nimpermissible conjecture to conclude that the jury understood the\r\n\ntrial judge's reference to the \"rest of the story\" as \"'a comment\r\n\non the failure of the accused to testify.'\"  See Glantz, 810 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 322  (noting that the  challenged comment must  be \"manifestly\r\n\nintended or . . . of such character that the jury would naturally\r                                                                           \r\n\nand  necessarily take it  to be a  comment on the  failure of the\r                          \r\n\naccused  to testify\")  (emphasis added)  (citation omitted).   It\r\n\nwould  be particularly  problematic  to  do  so here,  since  the\r\n\ndefense clearly  signaled that it  perceived the statement  to be\r\n\nobjectionable at the time only because the jury might take it  as\r\n\na  license to shift the burden of  proof.  We believe, therefore,\r\n\nthat  an appellate court would be overreaching were it to attrib-\r\n\nute to the jury  the more ominous interpretation now  proposed by\r\n\nthe defense.  See Robinson, 485 U.S. at 30. \r                                    \r\n\n          Second,  even  assuming  the  jury so  interpreted  the\r\n\njudge's  statement,  the  preliminary  instructions  emphatically\r\n\ncharged  that \"a  defendant has a  right to  remain silent  . . .\r\n\n[and] you should understand that if he does not [take the witness\r\n\nstand], you should not draw any inferences from that.\"  The final\r\n\ncharge once again stated that \"the fact  that a defendant has, in\r\n\nthis case, . . . chosen to exercise [the privilege against  self-\r\n\nincrimination]  should not  be considered  in any  way by  you as\r\n\nproving anything  one way or the  other.\"  Thus, we  see no sound\r\n\nbasis for  departing from  the customary presumption  that juries\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nfollow their instructions.   See Rullan-Rivera,      F.3d at     \r                                                        \r\n\n[No. 94-1890, 1995 U.S.  App. LEXIS 18434, at  *5 (1st Cir.  July\r\n\n21,  1995)].

The earlier proceedings are reported in United States v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754 (1st Cir.1995), and United States v. Hurley, 63 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1995).  After Gabriele was indicted for alleged participation in the Saccoccia criminal enterprise, he stipulated to the facts established by the government at the two earlier trials involving Stephen Saccoccia and his codefendants.  We relate only the background information material to Gabriele's involvement in the criminal enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The money laundering operation primarily functioned through precious metals companies controlled by Saccoccia and located in Los Angeles, New York, and Rhode Island.  Colombian drug dealers transferred huge sums to the Saccoccia organization for laundering.  Employing various techniques, such as purchases of gold and cashier's checks, the Saccoccia organization laundered the drug monies and funneled laundered funds back to Colombia by circuitous techniques (e.g., multiple wire transfers and interstate transportation).  Some of the gold was delivered to Recovery Technologies, Inc.  (\"RTI\"), a precious metals dealer located in Attleboro, Massachusetts, and controlled and operated by Gabriele.  The gold was kept in a safe purchased by Saccoccia and installed at RTI with Gabriele's consent.  At one point Gabriele prophetically observed in relation to the gold deliveries:  \"Steve [Saccoccia] is going to put us all in jail some day.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1991, after learning that two of his Rhode Island companies were under FBI video surveillance, Saccoccia pointed out the concealed surveillance cameras to Gabriele.  Shortly thereafter, Saccoccia announced his intention to acquire RTI from Gabriele and hired Gabriele as his employee.  Saccoccia then began to divert to RTI the cash and gold shipments which could no longer be delivered undetected to the two Saccoccia companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deliveries to RTI were monitored by Saccoccia employees.  Among the persons at RTI, Gabriele alone knew about, and participated in counting, the cash and gold shipments from Saccoccia.  The shipments to RTI were recorded by Gabriele in coded language.  The coded records were kept in the desk in Gabriele's private office, separate from all other RTI records.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  During this period, Gabriele again voiced concern that Saccoccia \"is going to put us all in jail.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From time to time Saccoccia instructed Gabriele to transfer the large sums of cash kept in the RTI safe.  On various occasions Gabriele wired funds to designated banks at Saccoccia's direction or turned over funds directly to Saccoccia couriers who had been told to leave cash amounts for Gabriele.  Saccoccia and Gabriele discussed their ongoing cash transactions in a coded conversation intercepted by the FBI in October 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Gabriele was indicted on a RICO conspiracy charge, along with Saccoccia and others, and separately charged with engaging in eight monetary transactions involving criminally derived property.  A jury convicted him of RICO conspiracy and six monetary transaction charges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>II</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gabriele takes the district court to task on several rulings, which we discuss in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Section 1957</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Mens Rea</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, he claims that the mens rea element under section 1957 is unconstitutionally vague, see, e.g., Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 1858, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983), and that the district court therefore erred in denying his pretrial motion to dismiss the section 1957 charges.  The crux of the argument is that section 1957 is a rather novel statute, in that it criminalizes conduct by a person once removed from that of the person who generated the criminally derived property.  Thus, he argues, the proscribed conduct is not likely to appear unlawful to an ordinary citizen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, he contends that section 1957 is unconstitutional on its face, in that it chills legitimate business transactions because a prudent business person could never be sure how many suspicion-arousing \"red flags\" would be enough to lead a jury to infer that the person \"knew\" that a client or customer was engaged in criminal activity.  Alternatively he suggests that persons engaged in honest business dealings would be forced to rely on racial or ethnic stereotyping, as by refusing to do business with \"known\" criminals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1957(a) prohibits \"knowingly engag[ing] in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property that is of a value greater than $10,000 and is derived from specified unlawful activity....\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 1957(a).  \"Criminally derived property\" is \"any property constituting, or derived from, proceeds obtained from a criminal offense.\"   Id. Sec. 1957(f)(2).  A defendant may not be convicted under section 1957(a) unless he knew that the transaction involved \"criminally derived\" property, id. Sec. 1957(c), but he need not have known that the subject property was derived from \"specified unlawful activity,\" id.   The denial of a pretrial motion to dismiss criminal charges is reviewed de novo.   See United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta, 957 F.2d 18, 21 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 105, 121 L.Ed.2d 64 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, given the prominent \"red flags\" that signaled the criminal nature of the Saccoccia money laundering operation to Gabriele (e.g., knowledge of government surveillance;  evasionary tactics;  large volumes of secreted cash), as well as the strong evidence of Gabriele's mens rea (\"some day Stephen Saccoccia is going to put us all in jail\"), the instant constitutional challenge to the \"knowledge\" requirement under section 1957 has the ring of desperation.  See United States v. Baker, 19 F.3d 605, 614 (11th Cir.1994) (rejecting comparable as-applied challenge to Sec. 1957).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the facial challenge to the statute is without persuasive force.  Section 1957 is but another in a substantial line of federal criminal statutes whose only mens rea requirement is \"knowledge\" of the prior criminal conduct that tainted the property involved in the proscribed activity.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2312 (prohibiting interstate transportation of automobiles \"knowing the same to be stolen\");  Sec. 2313 (same, for receipt of such automobiles);  Sec. 2314 (criminalizing interstate transportation of goods \"knowing the same to have been stolen, converted, or taken by fraud\").  Thus, Gabriele's policy argument reduces to an attempt to second-guess the congressional decision to criminalize a particular type of \"knowing\" conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gabriele further claims that the district court erred in rejecting proposed jury instructions defining the section 1957 \"knowledge\" element with greater precision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  As he did not adequately renew his objections to the charge prior to the time the jury retired to deliberate, see Fed.R.Crim.P. 30, we review for plain error.

Our review confirms that the district court instruction in all respects delineated the appropriate \"knowledge\" element for application by the jury.  See United States v. Noone, 913 F.2d 20, 30 (1st Cir.1990) (refusal to give requested instruction not reversible error if instruction given was substantially correct and substantially covered defendant's request), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 906, 111 S.Ct. 1686, 114 L.Ed.2d 81 (1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Gabriele contends that the jury instruction on \"willful blindness\" was error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Since the government adduced no evidence that Gabriele had engaged in any particular conduct for the purpose of precluding his acquisition of actual knowledge that Saccoccia was engaged in unlawful activities, Gabriele argues that the \"willful blindness\" instruction necessarily suggested that the jury could convict if it found that he \"should have known\" that the gold and cash he received from Saccoccia derived from criminal activity.  Once again, we review for plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A willful blindness instruction is warranted if (1) the defendant claims lack of knowledge;  (2) the evidence would support an inference that the defendant consciously engaged in a course of deliberate ignorance;  and (3) the proposed instruction, as a whole, could not lead the jury to conclude that an inference of knowledge was mandatory.  See United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 452 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 80, 81, 130 L.Ed.2d 34 (1994);  United States v. Richardson, 14 F.3d 666, 671 (1st Cir.1994).  Gabriele concedes that the first and third elements were met but argues that the instruction was improper because the government failed to prove that though confronted with various \"red flags,\" he nonetheless said \"I don't want to know what they mean.\"   He is mistaken, however.  See, e.g., id. at 671 (finding no plain error in instructing jury on \"willful blindness\" where evidence indicated that defendant had been presented with a succession of \"flags of suspicion\" in business dealings).  There was no plain error in the district court instruction that \"knowledge\" could be inferred if the jury were to find that Gabriele consciously avoided the import of the conspicuous \"red flags\" involved here (e.g., government surveillance, large stores of cash, use of coded language).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.

Sec. 1957(f)(1) (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Gabriele contends that the government's evidence merely showed--as to five of the six counts of conviction under section 1957--that he received cash shipments from Saccoccia, counted and held them for safekeeping, then returned them through Saccoccia's emissaries.  Although mere receiving and holding comes within the broader definition of \"transaction\" found in the money laundering statute, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956(c)(3) (\"transaction\" includes \"delivery by, through, or to a financial institution\") (emphasis added), Gabriele argues that the language of section 1957(f)(1) clearly contemplates something more;  namely, evidence that the defendant in some manner further facilitated the laundering process itself;  for example, by commingling a cash \"deposit\" with the financial institution's own funds, altering the form of the property deposited (e.g., by purchasing gold or a cashier's check), or transferring the deposit, or its proceeds, to third parties, as by wire transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The denial of a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal is reviewed de novo to determine whether any rational factfinder could have found that the evidence presented at trial, together with all reasonable inferences, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, established each element of the particular offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

Sec. 5312, knowing that the transfer involved criminally derived property.  See United States v. Bohai Trading Co., 45 F.3d 577, 581 (1st Cir.1995).  We see no significance in the fact that Congress chose to insert in section 1956(c)(3) an illustrative list of the types of covered \"transfers,\" id. Sec. 1956(c)(3) (\"the term 'transaction' includes ... a transfer ... and with respect to a financial institution includes ...\") (emphasis added), then chose not to repeat that list in the non-illustrative definition appearing in section 1957(f)(1) (\"the term 'monetary transaction' means the deposit, withdrawal, or transfer ...\") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, given its particular intention to target money laundering in these companion statutes, we see no basis for the conjecture that section 1957(f)(1) was intended to proscribe only the conduct of those transferees who actually \"launder\" the cash or other property deposited (i.e., effect an alteration in its form).  The evidence in this case clearly established that Saccoccia arranged to \"transfer\" these large cash sums for the very purpose of having RTI hold the cash--safe from the recently discovered government surveillance at Saccoccia's two Rhode Island companies--for eventual laundering in the normal course.  We think this evidence demonstrated \"deposits\" or \"transfers\" sufficient to satisfy the statute.

Sec. 1962(c) (emphasis added).  Gabriele argues that it was error to instruct the jury that it need not find that he \"directed\" the Saccoccia enterprise since \"an enterprise is operated not just by upper management but also by lower rung participants who act on the direction of upper management.\"   See Reves v.

Although Gabriele preserved the present claim with a timely Rule 30 objection, it is foreclosed by recent circuit precedent.  See Hurley, 63 F.3d at 9 (finding no plain error, noting that Reves has no relevance to defendants who were \"employees,\" as distinguished from independent or outside participants like the accounting firm in Reves ) (citing United States v.

Even employees not engaged in directing the operations of the RICO enterprise are criminally liable if they are \"plainly integral to carrying [it] out.\"   See id.

Although this challenge was duly preserved as well, we will reverse only if the requested jury instructions represented substantially correct statements of the applicable law not substantially covered in the instructions given, and their omission seriously undermined Gabriele's ability to mount a defense.

Thus, it was predicated on an incorrect view of the law.  See supra Section II.B.1.  Whether or not RTI was part of the RICO enterprise, there was ample evidence from which the jury could find that Gabriele \"participated\" as a Saccoccia employee who was \"plainly integral to carrying out\" the enterprise even though he did not \"direct\" its operations.

Request No. 12 would have precluded conviction unless the jury found that Gabriele \"knew of the conspiracy's essential features, general scope, and overall goals.\"   These requests were substantially covered by the final charge, which repeatedly reminded the jury that acquittal was required unless it found that Gabriele \"under[stood] the unlawful nature of the plan\" and entered into a \"mutual agreement\" to accomplish \"some unlawful purpose.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Request No. 16 stated that \"a person who may have furnished goods, money, or services to another person who he knows is or will be engaged in criminal activity and that these goods or services may be used in that activity does not by furnishing such goods, money or services necessarily become a member of the conspiracy.\"   See Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703, 63 S.Ct. 1265, 87 L.Ed. 1674 (1943).  The truism underlying the requested instruction is that the seller's mere knowledge of the existence of a conspiracy is not in itself sufficient to convict him as a conspirator;  the seller must also have intended that the sale promote the unlawful goals of the conspiracy.  See, e.g., United States v. Garcia-Rosa, 876 F.2d 209, 216 (1st Cir.1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1030, 110 S.Ct. 742, 107 L.Ed.2d 760, cert. granted and vacated on other grounds, 498 U.S. 954, 111 S.Ct. 377, 112 L.Ed.2d 391 (1990).  Nonetheless, as we have noted, the Direct Sales Co. instruction normally is not essential if the trial court advises the jury that the defendant cannot be convicted absent a finding that he joined the conspiracy with intent to further its unlawful purposes.  Brandon, 17 F.3d at 448-49.   The jury charge repeatedly brought home the latter point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Request No. 20 stated a \"theory of the defense,\" in Gabriele's words;  namely \"that the Government has failed to prove ... that the defendant agreed to participate in the [conspiracy] ... or that he had knowledge that his transaction may have involved criminally derived property.\"   As a theory of the defense, the request overreached by attempting to co-opt the court.  To the extent the request purposed a \"reasonable doubt\" standard, it was surplusage, since the charge delineated the requisite elements under section 1962(c) and (d), and repeatedly instructed the jury that the government had the burden of proving each element beyond a reasonable doubt.  See United States v. Long, 977 F.2d 1264, 1272 (8th Cir.1992) (where lack of knowledge is defense, jury instructions on conspiracy, intent, and specific intent adequately covered \"theory of the defense\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  There was no instructional error relating to the RICO conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>C.

See Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965);  United States v. Lavoie, 721 F.2d 407, 410 (1st Cir.1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1069, 104 S.Ct. 1424, 79 L.Ed.2d 749 (1984).  Gabriele insists that the jury necessarily drew the improper inference that he would take the stand to \"tell his story,\" whereas in fact he rightfully elected not to testify.  He adds that the district court instruction given in lieu of his request for a mistrial was inadequate, because the court merely noted that a defendant bears no burden of proof in a criminal case, while failing to emphasize that no adverse inference may be drawn from a defendant's decision to exercise his constitutional right not to testify at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a statement in the presence of the jury infringed upon the privilege against self-incrimination is a question normally reviewed de novo.

On the other hand, the denial of a motion for mistrial is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Rullan-Rivera, 60 F.3d 16, 18 (1st Cir.1995).  As Gabriele interposed no timely objection,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> however, we review only for plain error.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).  In all events, we find neither plain error nor abuse of discretion in the denial of the motion for mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the colloquial expression utilized by the trial judge (\"we will hear the rest of the story\") plainly was intended merely to inform the jury that though the government's case had been completed, the defense--as distinguished from the defendant's testimony--had yet to be heard.  Although appellate review is plenary, Glantz, 810 F.2d at 320 n. 2, we think it would be imprudent to attribute the more ominous import now urged by Gabriele on appeal, in light of the view apparently taken by the trial court and counsel at the time.  See United States v. Robinson, 485 U.S. 25, 30-31, 108 S.Ct. 864, 867-68, 99 L.Ed.2d 23 (1988) (noting, in context of challenge to ambiguous statements of prosecutor--arguably constituting improper comment on defendant's exercise of privilege against self-incrimination--\"we do not think that an appellate court may substitute its reading ... for that of the trial court and counsel\").  Thus, we think it would amount to impermissible conjecture to conclude that the jury understood the trial judge's reference to the \"rest of the story\" as \" 'a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.' \"   See Glantz, 810 F.2d at 322 (noting that the challenged comment must be \"manifestly intended or ... of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify\") (emphasis added) (citation omitted).  It would be particularly problematic to do so here, since the defense clearly signaled that it perceived the statement to be objectionable at the time only because the jury might take it as a license to shift the burden of proof.  We believe, therefore, that an appellate court would be overreaching were it to attribute to the jury the more ominous interpretation now proposed by the defense.  See Robinson, 485 U.S. at 30, 108 S.Ct. at 867.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even assuming the jury so interpreted the judge's statement, the preliminary instructions emphatically charged that \"a defendant has a right to remain silent ... [and] you should understand that if he does not [take the witness stand], you should not draw any inferences from that.\"   The final charge once again stated that \"the fact that a defendant has, in this case, ... chosen to exercise [the privilege against self-incrimination] should not be considered in any way by you as proving anything one way or the other.\"   Thus, we see no sound basis for departing from the customary presumption that juries follow their instructions.

The earlier proceedings are reported in United States v. Saccoccia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196165\"><a href=\"/opinion/196165/united-states-v-saccoccia/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1995), and United States v.

After Gabriele was indicted for alleged participation in the Saccoccia criminal enterprise, he stipulated to the facts established by the government at the two earlier trials involving Stephen Saccoccia and his codefendants.  We relate only the background information material to Gabriele's involvement in the criminal enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The money laundering operation primarily functioned through precious metals companies controlled by Saccoccia and located in Los Angeles, New York, and Rhode Island.  Colombian drug dealers transferred huge sums to the Saccoccia organization for laundering.  Employing various techniques, such as purchases of gold and cashier's checks, the Saccoccia organization laundered the drug monies and funneled laundered funds back to Colombia by circuitous techniques (e.g., multiple wire transfers and interstate transportation).  Some of the gold was delivered to Recovery Technologies, Inc.  (\"RTI\"), a precious metals dealer located in Attleboro, Massachusetts, and controlled and operated by Gabriele.  The gold was kept in a safe purchased by Saccoccia and installed at RTI with Gabriele's consent.  At one point Gabriele prophetically observed in relation to the gold deliveries:  \"Steve [Saccoccia] is going to put us all in jail some day.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1991, after learning that two of his Rhode Island companies were under FBI video surveillance, Saccoccia pointed out the concealed surveillance cameras to Gabriele.  Shortly thereafter, Saccoccia announced his intention to acquire RTI from Gabriele and hired Gabriele as his employee.  Saccoccia then began to divert to RTI the cash and gold shipments which could no longer be delivered undetected to the two Saccoccia companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deliveries to RTI were monitored by Saccoccia employees.  Among the persons at RTI, Gabriele alone knew about, and participated in counting, the cash and gold shipments from Saccoccia.  The shipments to RTI were recorded by Gabriele in coded language.  The coded records were kept in the desk in Gabriele's private office, separate from all other RTI records.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  During this period, Gabriele again voiced concern that Saccoccia \"is going to put us all in jail.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From time to time Saccoccia instructed Gabriele to transfer the large sums of cash kept in the RTI safe.  On various occasions Gabriele wired funds to designated banks at Saccoccia's direction or turned over funds directly to Saccoccia couriers who had been told to leave cash amounts for Gabriele.  Saccoccia and Gabriele discussed their ongoing cash transactions in a coded conversation intercepted by the FBI in October 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Gabriele was indicted on a RICO conspiracy charge, along with Saccoccia and others, and separately charged with engaging in eight monetary transactions involving criminally derived property.  A jury convicted him of RICO conspiracy and six monetary transaction charges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>II</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gabriele takes the district court to task on several rulings, which we discuss in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Section 1957</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Mens Rea</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, he claims that the mens rea element under section 1957 is unconstitutionally vague, see, e.g., Kolender v. Lawson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110926\"><a href=\"/opinion/110926/kolender-v-lawson/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span>, 357, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110926\"><a href=\"/opinion/110926/kolender-v-lawson/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1855</span></a></span>, 1858, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110926\"><a href=\"/opinion/110926/kolender-v-lawson/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">903</span> </a></span>(1983), and that the district court therefore erred in denying his pretrial motion to dismiss the section 1957 charges.  The crux of the argument is that section 1957 is a rather novel statute, in that it criminalizes conduct by a person once removed from that of the person who generated the criminally derived property.  Thus, he argues, the proscribed conduct is not likely to appear unlawful to an ordinary citizen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, he contends that section 1957 is unconstitutional on its face, in that it chills legitimate business transactions because a prudent business person could never be sure how many suspicion-arousing \"red flags\" would be enough to lead a jury to infer that the person \"knew\" that a client or customer was engaged in criminal activity.  Alternatively he suggests that persons engaged in honest business dealings would be forced to rely on racial or ethnic stereotyping, as by refusing to do business with \"known\" criminals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1957(a) prohibits \"knowingly engag[ing] in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property that is of a value greater than $10,000 and is derived from specified unlawful activity....\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 1957(a).  \"Criminally derived property\" is \"any property constituting, or derived from, proceeds obtained from a criminal offense.\"   <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110926\"><a href=\"/opinion/110926/kolender-v-lawson/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Sec. 1957(f)(2). </a></span> A defendant may not be convicted under section 1957(a) unless he knew that the transaction involved \"criminally derived\" property, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110926\"><a href=\"/opinion/110926/kolender-v-lawson/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Sec. 1957(c), </a></span>but he need not have known that the subject property was derived from \"specified unlawful activity,\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110926\"><a href=\"/opinion/110926/kolender-v-lawson/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>   The denial </a></span>of a pretrial motion to dismiss criminal charges is reviewed de novo.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span> </span>(1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, given the prominent \"red flags\" that signaled the criminal nature of the Saccoccia money laundering operation to Gabriele (e.g., knowledge of government surveillance;  evasionary tactics;  large volumes of secreted cash), as well as the strong evidence of Gabriele's mens rea (\"some day Stephen Saccoccia is going to put us all in jail\"), the instant constitutional challenge to the \"knowledge\" requirement under section 1957 has the ring of desperation.  See United States v. Baker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"665876\"><a href=\"/opinion/665876/united-states-of-america-plaintiff-appellant-cross-appellee-v-russell-k/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span>, 614 (11th Cir.1994) (rejecting comparable as-applied challenge to Sec. 1957).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the facial challenge to the statute is without persuasive force.  Section 1957 is but another in a substantial line of federal criminal statutes whose only mens rea requirement is \"knowledge\" of the prior criminal conduct that tainted the property involved in the proscribed activity.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2312 (prohibiting interstate transportation of automobiles \"knowing the same to be stolen\");  Sec. 2313 (same, for receipt of such automobiles);  Sec. 2314 (criminalizing interstate transportation of goods \"knowing the same to have been stolen, converted, or taken by fraud\").  Thus, Gabriele's policy argument reduces to an attempt to second-guess the congressional decision to criminalize a particular type of \"knowing\" conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gabriele further claims that the district court erred in rejecting proposed jury instructions defining the section 1957 \"knowledge\" element with greater precision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  As he did not adequately renew his objections to the charge prior to the time the jury retired to deliberate, see Fed.R.Crim.P. 30, we review for plain error.  See United States v. O'Connor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195444\"><a href=\"/opinion/195444/united-states-v-oconnor/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 220-21 (1st Cir.1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court carefully instructed the jury that Gabriele could not be convicted unless he \"knew that the money or property involved in [the particular] monetary transaction was obtained from the proceeds of some criminal offense,\" and that the \"knowledge\" element was not met merely by a finding that Gabriele \"might have known,\" \"should have known,\" or \"could have known.\"   Like terms denoting other mens rea elements, \"knowledge\" is not readily susceptible to a more precise definition than is derived from the connotation suggested by the term itself.  Our review confirms that the district court instruction in all respects delineated the appropriate \"knowledge\" element for application by the jury.  See United States v. Noone, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547469\"><a href=\"/opinion/547469/united-states-v-peter-noone/\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.1990) (refusal to give requested instruction not reversible error if instruction given was substantially correct and substantially covered defendant's request), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">906</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Once again, we review for plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A willful blindness instruction is warranted if (1) the defendant claims lack of knowledge;  (2) the evidence would support an inference that the defendant consciously engaged in a course of deliberate ignorance;  and (3) the proposed instruction, as a whole, could not lead the jury to conclude that an inference of knowledge was mandatory.  See United States v. Brandon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span>, 452 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Richardson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></span>, 671 (1st Cir.1994).  Gabriele concedes that the first and third elements were met but argues that the instruction was improper because the government failed to prove that though confronted with various \"red flags,\" he nonetheless said \"I don't want to know what they mean.\"   He is mistaken, however.  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 671 </span>(finding no plain error in instructing jury on \"willful blindness\" where evidence indicated that defendant had been presented with a succession of \"flags of suspicion\" in business dealings).  There was no plain error in the district court instruction that \"knowledge\" could be inferred if the jury were to find that Gabriele consciously avoided the import of the conspicuous \"red flags\" involved here (e.g., government surveillance, large stores of cash, use of coded language).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Motion for Judgment of Acquittal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pre-1992 version of section 1957(f)(1) defined \"monetary transaction\" as \"the deposit, withdrawal, transfer, or exchange, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, of funds or a monetary instrument ... by, through or to a financial institution (as defined in section 5312 of title 31)....\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 1957(f)(1) (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Gabriele contends that the government's evidence merely showed--as to five of the six counts of conviction under section 1957--that he received cash shipments from Saccoccia, counted and held them for safekeeping, then returned them through Saccoccia's emissaries.  Although mere receiving and holding comes within the broader definition of \"transaction\" found in the money laundering statute, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956(c)(3) (\"transaction\" includes \"delivery by, through, or to a financial institution\") (emphasis added), Gabriele argues that the language of section 1957(f)(1) clearly contemplates something more;  namely, evidence that the defendant in some manner further facilitated the laundering process itself;  for example, by commingling a cash \"deposit\" with the financial institution's own funds, altering the form of the property deposited (e.g., by purchasing gold or a cashier's check), or transferring the deposit, or its proceeds, to third parties, as by wire transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The denial of a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal is reviewed de novo to determine whether any rational factfinder could have found that the evidence presented at trial, together with all reasonable inferences, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, established each element of the particular offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

It's important, however, to bear in mind that mere negligence or mistake in failing to learn a fact is not sufficient.\"  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The following colloquy occurred at side-bar immediately after the jury charge:</p>\n        <p>[Defense counsel]:  I specifically object to ... the willful blindness, so-called conscious avoidance instruction.

See 31 U.S.C. Sec. 5312(a)(2)(N) (term includes \"a dealer in precious metals\").  Gabriele's reply brief argues that these cash shipments were made \"to him at RTI,\" not to RTI.  As Gabriele did not make this argument, either in the district court or in his opening brief on appeal, it is deemed waived.  See United States v.

Gabriele responds that he delayed his Fifth Amendment objection until the defense rested, because he had not yet decided whether to take the stand</p>\n        <p>We think the delay in interposing an objection on the Fifth Amendment ground effected a waiver.  Whether or not Gabriele ever took the stand, the district court's statement (as construed by Gabriele) could have had a coercive effect upon his decision whether to testify.  Thus, had the alleged Fifth Amendment infringement been perceived, it seems clear that it would have been more advantageous to raise it before that decision had to be made.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
