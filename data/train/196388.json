McCloskey,  United States  Attorney, and  F. Mark Terison,\r                                                                             \r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per  Curiam.    Andres  Gonzalez was  convicted  of\r                                 \r\n\nconspiring to  possess cocaine with intent  to distribute and\r\n\nwas ultimately sentenced to serve 210 months in jail.  He now\r\n\nappeals  from the denial of his motion to vacate his sentence\r\n\nunder 28 U.S.C.   2255.  We affirm.\r\n\n          Gonzalez claims  that the  district court  erred in\r\n\nsentencing him predicated  on a finding that his base offense\r\n\nlevel  should be  calculated on  15-49 kilograms  of cocaine,\r\n\nalleging  that  it  found  only  that  he  had  conspired  to\r\n\ndistribute cocaine in excess of 10 kilograms.  He also claims\r\n\nthat  his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel\r\n\nby  failing  to object  to this  error  at sentencing  and on\r\n\nappeal.   The  sentencing transcript  shows clearly  that the\r\n\ncourt found that use of the 15-49 kilogram base offense level\r\n\nwas proper  because Gonzalez  had conspired to  distribute in\r\n\nexcess  of  15 kilograms  of  cocaine, and  we  affirmed that\r\n\nfinding on appeal.  See United States  v. Moreno, 947 F.2d 7,\r                                                            \r\n\n8-9 (1st  Cir. 1991).   The sentencing transcript  passage to\r\n\nwhich  Gonzalez refers  is either  a mistranscription  of the\r\n\ncourt's comments or an inadvertent misstatement by the court.\r\n\nBecause Gonzalez's claim of error  by the court is meritless,\r\n\nso, too, is  the claim of  ineffective assistance of  counsel\r\n\nbased on it.\r\n\n          Gonzalez  also   argues  that  the   court  had  no\r\n\njurisdiction to sentence  him on amounts of cocaine he agreed\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nto provide  in negotiations with government  agents since his\r\n\nco-conspirator had not participated in those negotiations and\r\n\nhad not agreed  to provide  such amounts.   He avers  further\r\n\nthat  his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel\r\n\nby  not arguing such lack of jurisdiction at sentencing or on\r\n\ndirect appeal.   Because these  claims were not  presented to\r\n\nthe district court, they are not before us and we decline  to\r\n\nconsider them.  See United States v.  Ocasio-Rivera, 991 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993). \r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                               \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
