Rhode  Island's automobile\n                                   \n\ndealership  law  allows  existing dealers  within  a  twenty-mile\n\nradius of a proposed new dealership to protest  the establishment\n\nof  the new dealership.  The issue raised by this appeal concerns\n\nsituations  in which, by reason  of a proposed  new dealership in\n\nproximity  to the state border, a part of that twenty-mile radius\n\nfalls  outside of Rhode Island.   State officials  have taken the\n\nposition that within the  twenty-mile area surrounding a proposed\n\nnew dealership,  only the  dealers who  are located  inside Rhode\n\nIsland's borders are  covered by  Rhode Island law  and thus  are\n\nentitled to protest the  establishment of the new dealership.   A\n\nMassachusetts car  dealer who  is located within  the twenty-mile\n\nradius  of a  proposed dealership,  but in  Massachusetts, claims\n\nthat  this interpretation of Rhode  Island law runs  afoul of the\n\nCommerce  Clause because  it  burdens  and discriminates  against\n\ninterstate commerce.  Because Rhode Island is merely applying its\n\nlaw to those  subject to its jurisdiction and  regulation, rather\n\nthan  extraterritorially,  and  because  it  neither burdens  nor\n\ndiscriminates  against interstate  commerce  in the  process,  we\n\nagree with Rhode Island and affirm.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Plaintiff-appellant Fireside Nissan, Inc. (\"Fireside\"),\n\na Massachusetts  automobile dealer,  brought this  action against\n\nthe  Rhode  Island Department  of Transportation  (\"RIDOT\") after\n\nRIDOT excluded Fireside from participating in  hearings regarding\n\na proposed Nissan  dealership in Rhode Island.   Fireside claimed\n\n                               -2-\n\nthat RIDOT's application of Rhode Island's new dealership law  to\n\nexclude  Fireside merely  because  it was  not  located in  Rhode\n\nIsland was unconstitutional.\n\n          Rhode  Island  General Laws,  Section  31-5.1-4.21 sets\n\nout  certain  procedural  requirements  for  establishing  a  new\n\nautomobile  dealership  in  the  state.   First,  a  manufacturer\n\ndesiring  an additional  dealership must  notify dealers  \"in the\n\nrelevant market  area\" of its intentions.   R.I. Gen. Laws    31-\n\n5.1-4.2(a).   \"Relevant  market  area\" is  defined  as \"the  area\n\nwithin a radius of twenty (20) miles around an existing dealer or\n\nthe area of responsibility defined in the franchise, whichever is\n\ngreater.\"   R.I Gen. Laws   31-5.1-1(J).  Existing retail dealers\n\nin the \"relevant  market area\" may then protest the establishment\n\n                    \n\n1  R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2 provides in relevant part:\n\n            (a)  In  the  event  that  a manufacturer\n            seeks   to   enter   into   a   franchise\n            establishing  an   additional  new  motor\n            vehicle dealership . . . within or into a\n            relevant  market area where the same line\n            make  is  then  represented,  .  . .  the\n            manufacturer   shall    in   writing   by\n            certified    mail   first    notify   the\n            department  .  .  . and  each  new  motor\n            vehicle dealer in  such line make  in the\n            relevant market area . . .  .  [A]ny such\n            new  motor  vehicle  dealership may  file\n            with  the  department  a  protest  to the\n            establishing  or  relocating  of the  new\n            motor vehicle  dealership .  . . .   When\n            such  a  protest  is  filed, .  .  .  the\n            manufacturer   shall  not   establish  or\n            relocate the proposed  new motor  vehicle\n            dealership .  . .   until the  department\n            has held a hearing, nor thereafter, until\n            the  department has  determined [whether]\n            there  is good  cause for  not permitting\n            such new motor vehicle dealership.\n\n                               -3-\n\nof the new dealership in which case RIDOT must hold  a hearing to\n\ndetermine  if  \"there  is  good cause  for  not  permitting\"  the\n\nadditional  franchise.   R.I.  Gen. Laws     31-5.1-4.2(a).   The\n\nstatute  does not explicitly state whether or not the dealers who\n\nmay  protest the establishment  of a dealership  in the \"relevant\n\nmarket area\"  must be located  in Rhode Island  or be  a licensed\n\nRhode Island dealership.2\n\n          In March  of 1991,  Nissan Motor Corporation  in U.S.A.\n\n(\"Nissan USA\"), gave notice to  RIDOT, Fireside, and other Nissan\n\ndealers of its intention to establish a dealership in Smithfield,\n\nRhode  Island.    Fireside,   which  sells  and  services  Nissan\n\n                    \n\n2   Throughout Title  31  of the  Motor  Vehicle Code,  the  term\n\"dealer\" is defined as: \n\n            Every  person engaged in  the business of\n            buying,  selling, or  exchanging vehicles\n            of  a  type  required  to  be  registered\n            hereunder  and  who  has  an  established\n            place  of  business for  such  purpose in\n                                                     \n            this state.\n                      \n\nR.I. Gen. Laws   31-1-19 (emphasis added).\n\nFor purposes of the provision regarding the  establishment of new\ncar dealerships, R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2, however, the  right\nto protest at a hearing applies to any \"new motor vehicle dealer\"\nwhich is defined as:\n\n            [A]ny person  engaged in the  business of\n            selling, offering to sell,  soliciting or\n            advertising   the   sale  of   new  motor\n            vehicles and  who holds, or  held at  the\n            time a cause of action under this chapter\n            accrued,  a  valid   sales  and   service\n            agreement, franchise or contract, granted\n            by  the  manufacturer or  distributor for\n            the retail sale of said manufacturer's or\n            distributor's new motor vehicles.\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-1(C).\n\n                               -4-\n\nautomobiles,   is  located  in  North  Attleboro,  Massachusetts,\n\napproximately two miles  from the Rhode Island  border and within\n\ntwenty  miles  of Smithfield.    Fireside  is therefore  squarely\n\nwithin the  \"relevant market area\" of  the Smithfield dealership.\n\nFireside  is not a licensed automobile dealer in Rhode Island but\n\ninstead holds a Massachusetts dealership license.\n\n          In response  to Nissan  USA's notice, Fireside  filed a\n\nprotest with RIDOT on April 12, 1991.  Three Rhode Island dealers\n\nof Nissan automobiles, who were  also within the \"relevant market\n\narea,\" filed protests  with RIDOT as well.  On February 13, 1992,\n\nRIDOT issued a notice  to Fireside and the other  dealers stating\n\nthat  it  was  scheduling  a  hearing  regarding  the  Smithfield\n\ndealership on April 2, 1992.\n\n          At the  hearing, Nissan  USA moved to  exclude Fireside\n\nbecause it was an out-of state dealer.  RIDOT, acting through the\n\nRhode Island Dealer's License  and Regulations Office, determined\n\nthat Fireside lacked  standing to participate in the  hearing and\n\nexcluded Fireside  from presenting  witnesses or evidence  at the\n\nhearing.  The three  Rhode Island dealers did participate  at the\n\nhearing and presented evidence on their own behalf.\n\n          Fireside  was  prepared  to  present  evidence  at  the\n\nhearing  showing  that 48%  of Fireside's  sales  and 45%  of its\n\nservice  business went to  Rhode Island residents.   In addition,\n\nFireside would have established that 100% of its cable television\n\nadvertising and 75%  of its  print advertising is  done in  Rhode\n\nIsland.\n\n                               -5-\n\n          After  the hearing,  RIDOT determined  that good  cause\n\nexisted  for  the  establishment of  the  Smithfield  dealership.\n\nAccording  to R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2(b), RIDOT must base its\n\ndetermination of  \"good  cause\" on  the \"existing  circumstances,\n\nincluding, but not limited to:\"\n\n            (1)   Permanency of the investment of the\n            existing new motor  vehicle dealer(s)  in\n            the community;\n\n            (2)    Whether  the  new   motor  vehicle\n            dealers  of the  same  line make  in that\n            relevant   market   area  are   providing\n            adequate  consumer care . . . which shall\n            include  the  adequacy  of motor  vehicle\n            sales and  service facilities, equipment,\n            supply  of  motor   vehicle  parts,   and\n            qualified service personnel;\n\n            (3)  Whether there is reasonable evidence\n            that  after the granting of the new motor\n            vehicle dealership, that [sic] the market\n            would  support all of  the dealerships of\n            that  line  make in  the  relevant market\n            area;\n\n            (4)      Consequently,   whether  it   is\n            injurious  to the  public welfare  for an\n            additional  new motor  vehicle dealership\n            to be established.\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2(b).\n\nUpon consideration of these factors, RIDOT found cause to issue a\n\nlicense  to  the Smithfield  dealership,  which is  now  known as\n\nNissan of Smithfield, Inc. (\"Smithfield Nissan\").\n\n          Fireside commenced this action on April 9, 1992, naming\n\nDaniel  Fanning, Director  of RIDOT as  the defendant.   Fireside\n\nsought a  declaration that RIDOT's interpretation  of Section 31-\n\n5.1-4.2  as excluding  Fireside from  the new  dealership hearing\n\nviolated  the  Commerce  Clause, the  Privileges  and  Immunities\n\n                               -6-\n\nClause, the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of\n\nthe  United  States  Constitution.     Fireside  also  sought  an\n\ninjunction  restraining  RIDOT   from  precluding  Fireside  from\n\nparticipating  in   future  hearings  as  well   as  a  temporary\n\nrestraining order  and a preliminary  injunction enjoining  RIDOT\n\nfrom granting  a dealership license to Smithfield Nissan.  Nissan\n\nUSA and Smithfield Nissan intervened in the action.\n\n          The district court denied Fireside's  requested relief.\n\nThe  court  found  that  the   exclusion  of  Fireside  from  the\n\ndealership  hearings  did  not  violate the  Commerce  Clause  or\n\notherwise violate Fireside's constitutional rights.  As a result,\n\nFireside could not show the irreparable harm or the likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits necessary for the granting of a preliminary\n\ninjunction.   The  court also  denied  Fireside's request  for  a\n\ndeclaratory  judgment and  a permanent  injunction and  entered a\n\nfinal  judgment  in favor  of RIDOT,  Nissan USA,  and Smithfield\n\nNissan.\n\n                          II.  ANALYSIS\n\n          Fireside's right to its requested relief, including the\n\npreliminary   and  permanent  injunctions   and  the  declaratory\n\njudgment, depends primarily on  whether the exclusion of Fireside\n\nfrom RIDOT's  new dealership hearings violates  the Constitution.\n\nBefore the  court will  grant a preliminary  injunction, Fireside\n\nmust establish, among other things, that it faces a likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits and that it will suffer irreparable harm if\n\nthe injunction  is  not issued.    Planned Parenthood  League  v.\n                                                             \n\n                               -7-\n\nBellotti,  641 F.2d 1006, 1009 (1st Cir. 1981).  Fireside alleges\n        \n\nthat it will suffer irreparable  injury from RIDOT's violation of\n\nFireside's constitutional rights.   See National People's  Action\n                                                                 \n\nv.  Village of  Wilmette, 914  F.2d 1008,  1013 (7th  Cir. 1990),\n                        \n\ncert.  denied,  499  U.S.  921  (1991)  (finding   constitutional\n             \n\nviolation sufficient  to establish irreparable  injury); Mitchell\n                                                                 \n\nv. Cuomo, 748 F.2d 804, 806 (2d Cir. 1984) (same).  Likewise, the\n        \n\nmerits of  the permanent injunction and  the declaratory judgment\n\nalso turn on  the constitutionality of RIDOT's  actions.  Because\n\nwe uphold the district court's finding that RIDOT did not violate\n\nthe Commerce  Clause or any of  Fireside's constitutional rights,\n\nwe affirm the final judgment in favor of the defendants.\n\n          As  a preliminary matter, we  find it beneficial to our\n\nconstitutional inquiry to clarify the  nature and purpose of  the\n\nRhode Island new dealership statute, R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2.\n\nTitle 31 of Rhode Island General Laws governs state regulation of\n\nmotor  and other vehicles.   Chapter 5.1 of  that title regulates\n\nbusiness practices among motor vehicle manufacturers, dealers and\n\ndistributors.   The provision  covering the establishment  of new\n\nautomobile dealerships, R.I. Gen.  Laws   31-5.1-4.2, is designed\n\nto protect  existing dealers  and consumers from  the detrimental\n\neffects  of aggressive  franchising practices  by the  automobile\n\nmanufacturers  whose  efforts  to  establish  excessive competing\n\nfranchises  are considered  to be  potentially \"injurious  to the\n\npublic welfare\" if not properly regulated.  R.I.  Gen. Laws   31-\n\n5.1-4.2(b).\n\n                               -8-\n\n          The district court found that the statute targeted only\n\nactivities which occur within the state of Rhode Island performed\n\nby  businesses  seeking   or  holding  Rhode  Island   dealership\n\nlicenses.   According to the  court, R.I. Gen.  Laws   31-5.1-4.2\n\nwas designed  to  safeguard the  interests of  those dealers  and\n\nconsumers located  in Rhode Island; the  Rhode Island legislature\n\ndid not  intend for the statute  to apply to, or  for the benefit\n\nof,  out-of-state dealers  such as  Fireside.   As a  result, the\n\ncourt  concluded  that  RIDOT  properly applied  the  statute  by\n\nexcluding Fireside from the new dealership hearings.\n\n          We  agree with  the  district court's  finding on  this\n\nissue.   Taking its cue from the Sixth Circuit, which interpreted\n\na similar Kentucky statute as excluding out-of-state dealers from\n\nnew  dealership hearings, BMW  Stores, Inc. v.  Peugeot Motors of\n                                                                 \n\nAm., Inc., 860 F.2d 212 (6th Cir. 1988), the district court based\n         \n\nits  analysis on the stated purposes and language of the statute,\n\nthe  interpretation of  the statute  by  state regulators  and on\n\ngeneral principles  of statutory  construction.  Because  we find\n\nthe  first  two factors  to  be the  relevant  considerations, we\n\ndiscuss them below.\n\n          Although  R.I.   Gen.  Laws      31-5.1-4.2  does   not\n\nexplicitly include or exclude  out-of-state dealers, the declared\n\npolicy  of the statute  indicates a  concern for  protecting only\n\nRhode Island dealers and  residents.  As in  BMW Stores, the  new\n                                                       \n\ndealership  licensing  provision  is  aimed  at  protecting  \"the\n\ninvestment of  the existing  new motor vehicle  dealer[s] in  the\n\n                               -9-\n\ncommunity\" and safeguarding the \"public welfare.\"  R.I. Gen. Laws\n\n  31-5.1-4.2(b).  BMW  Stores, 860 F.2d at  215 (noting that  the\n                             \n\ndeclared  policy of  the  Kentucky statute  was to  \"preserve the\n\ninvestments  and properties  of  the citizens  of this  state\").3\n\nThe new dealership  provision is one part of a  set of provisions\n\nconcerning the duties, obligations, liabilities and privileges of\n\nlicensed   dealers  in   Rhode   Island   and   their   supplying\n\nmanufacturers.   R.I. Gen.  Laws.    31-5.1-1  through 31-5.1-20.\n\nNone of these duties and obligations apply to Fireside because it\n\nis  not licensed  in Rhode Island.   Accordingly,  the privileges\n\nthat  correspond to such duties  and obligations do  not apply to\n\nFireside  either.    The   new  dealership  provision,  with  its\n\nprocedure for  hearings,  is  simply part  and  parcel  of  Rhode\n\nIsland's regulation and licensing of local dealerships.  It makes\n\nno  sense,  therefore,  to  apply  Rhode  Island's  comprehensive\n\nregulatory scheme for the benefit of out-of-state dealers.\n\n          Furthermore,   as  in  BMW   Stores,  state  regulatory\n                                             \n\nofficials have interpreted the  state's new dealership statute as\n\n                    \n\n3   We do not attach  any significance, as does  Fireside, to the\nuse  of the word \"community\" in Rhode Island's statute instead of\nthe words \"citizens of this state\" in the Kentucky statute.  Both\nterms  evidence the legislature's concern with the welfare of the\npublic  which  it is  charged  with protecting.    Also, Fireside\nincorrectly  claims that  the Kentucky  statute differs  from the\nRhode Island  statute  because Kentucky's  does  not state  as  a\npurpose  the safeguarding  of the general  public interest.   The\nKentucky  statute  explicitly  states  that its  purpose  is  the\npromotion  of  \"the  public  interest  and  public  welfare\"  and\nmentions  as  one of  its concerns  the provision  of \"convenient\nconsumer  care,\" which  clearly  indicates the  same concern  for\nconsumers and the public  as the Rhode Island statute.   Ky. Rev.\nStat. Ann.    190.015; 190.047(7)(b).\n\n                               -10-\n\napplying  only  to  in-state   dealers,  an  interpretation  that\n\ndeserves some measure of deference.  BMW Stores, 860 F.2d at 215;\n                                               \n\nGallison  v. Bristol School Comm., 493 A.2d 164, 166 (R.I. 1985).\n                                 \n\nWe disagree with Fireside's claim that RIDOT has not conclusively\n\ndetermined whether R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2 applies to out-of-\n\nstate dealers.   Fireside points  to the fact that,  prior to the\n\nhearing for Smithfield Nissan,  RIDOT promulgated proposed  rules\n\nand  regulations  that included  a  provision,  Section XI,  that\n\nexplicitly  excluded  out-of-state  dealers from  protesting  new\n\ndealerships and  participating in hearings.  The  final rules and\n\nregulations,  however, were issued  without adopting  Section XI.\n\nFireside argues that the failure to adopt Section XI indicates an\n\nintent  to  include out-of-state  dealers  in the  hearings.   We\n\ndisagree.\n\n          First of all, the proposed Section XI, while precluding\n\nout-of-state dealers from cross-examining witnesses or presenting\n\nevidence, did allow  for out-of-state dealers to offer  verbal or\n\nwritten statements  at the hearings  at RIDOT's discretion.   The\n\nproposal thus could be interpreted as granting more participation\n\nrights to  out-of-state dealers than they  would otherwise enjoy.\n\nAs a result, we do not  know if the proposal was rejected because\n\nit  was too permissive or  because it was  too restrictive, i.e.,\n\nbecause it  removed out-of-state participation rights  that RIDOT\n\nthought out-of-state  dealers should  have or because  it granted\n\nnew  rights that  RIDOT thought  out-of-state dealers  should not\n\nhave.     RIDOT's  failure  to  promulgate  Section  XI  is  thus\n\n                               -11-\n\ninconclusive.  Secondly, RIDOT's current regulations for R.I. 31-\n\n5.1 state that their purpose is:\n\n            (a) . . . to protect the interests of the\n            public  when  dealing with  motor vehicle\n            dealers in Rhode Island . . . .\n                                   \n\n            (b) . . .  to implement the provisions of\n            Sections  31-5  and 31-5.1  regarding the\n            issuance, suspension and/or revocation of\n            such  licenses as well  as the regulation\n            of    business   practices    among   the\n                                                     \n            businesses   seeking  or   holding  those\n                                                     \n            licenses. (emphasis added)\n                    \n\nThis  demonstrates RIDOT's intent to  apply R.I. Gen.  Laws   31-\n\n5.1-4.2 only to Rhode Island dealerships.  In any event, the only\n\nevidence we have of RIDOT actually taking a stand on the specific\n\nissue before us is RIDOT's actions in this case.  RIDOT  excluded\n\nFireside  from the  hearings and thereby  affirmatively expressed\n\nits interpretation  of  R.I. Gen.  Laws    31-5.1-4.2 as  barring\n\nparticipation of out-of-state dealers in new dealership hearings.\n\n          Fireside maintains that certain language in the statute\n\nexpresses an  intent to  include Fireside in  the new  dealership\n\nhearings.    Fireside notes  that  it  falls within  the  literal\n\ndefinition of  a \"new motor vehicle dealer\"  inside the \"relevant\n\nmarket area\" for purposes of R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2, because\n\nthe  definition  of  \"new  motor vehicle  dealer\"  includes  \"any\n\nperson\"  selling  cars, R.I.  Gen.  Laws    31-5.1-1(C),  and the\n\n\"relevant  market area\" is the  area within a  twenty mile radius\n\naround an existing  dealer, R.I.  Gen. Laws    31-5.1-1(J).   The\n\nlack of an  explicit statement  that the  \"relevant market  area\"\n\nstops  at the state border  does not, however,  indicate that the\n\n                               -12-\n\nstate affirmatively  intended to include out-of-state  dealers in\n\nlicensing hearings.  On the  contrary, the definition of \"dealer\"\n\nfor all of Title 31 of  Rhode Island's General Laws is limited to\n\npersons who  have  an  established place  of  business  \"in  this\n\nstate.\"  R.I.  Gen. Laws   31-1-19(a).  Fireside  is correct that\n\nthe  definition  of \"new  motor vehicle  dealer\"  as used  in the\n\nlicensing section at  issue here,  R.I. Gen.  Laws    31-5.1-4.2,\n\ndoes  not contain this limitation.  R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-1(C).\n\nHowever, the term \"relevant  market area,\" the other key  term in\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2, is  defined as a twenty mile  radius\n\n\"around an existing dealer,\"  employing the general term \"dealer\"\n                          \n\nfrom 31-1-19(a) and not \"new motor vehicle dealer\" from   31-5.1-\n\n1(C).  One could  thus interpret R.I. Gen.  Laws   31-5.1-4.2  as\n\ngranting protest rights only  to Rhode Island dealerships because\n\nonly Rhode Island dealers can be in a \"relevant market area.\"\n\n          Fireside also points to  R.I. Gen. Laws    31-5.1-2 for\n\nevidence  that  the licensing  provision applies  to out-of-state\n\ndealers.  R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-2 states:\n\n            Any  person  who   engages  directly   or\n            indirectly in  purposeful contacts within\n            this   state   in  connection   with  the\n            offering or advertising  for sale or  has\n            business dealings with respect to a motor\n            vehicle within the state shall be subject\n            to  the  provisions of  this  chapter and\n            shall be  subject to the  jurisdiction of\n            the courts of this state, upon service of\n            process in accordance with the provisions\n            of the general laws.\n\nThis provision is not a general  grant of extraterritoriality but\n\nrather an affirmation that parties who are covered by the various\n\n                               -13-\n\nsubstantive  provisions  in  Chapter   5.1  of  Title  31,  which\n\nregulates manufacturers, dealers and distributors,  cannot escape\n\nenforcement   of   those   provisions   by  claiming   they   are\n\nnonresidents.   If  Fireside's interpretation  were adopted,  the\n\nsubstantive regulatory provisions in  Chapter 5.1 -- for example,\n\nthose  regarding fraud and breach  of warranty --  would apply to\n\nFireside  and  any other  dealer in  any  other state,  an absurd\n\nresult.   Notwithstanding  R.I. Gen.  Laws    31-5.1-2,  one must\n\nstill look to the specific  substantive provisions of Chapter 5.1\n\nto see who is covered.  Doing so reveals that   31-5.2 was mainly\n\ndirected  toward  out-of-state  automobile manufacturers,  rather\n                                                        \n\nthan dealers.  A majority of the provisions in chapter 5.1 impose\n\nexplicit duties and  obligations on manufacturers, all or most of\n\nwhom, presumably,  are,  like Nissan  USA,  from outside  of  the\n\nstate.   E.g.,  R.I.  Gen. Laws      31-5.1-4 through  31-5.1-11.\n             \n\nUnlike  the  definition  of  \"new  motor  vehicle  dealer\"  which\n\nincludes  generally \"any person\"  selling cars, R.I.  Gen. Laws  \n\n31-5.1-1(C),  the  definition   of  \"manufacturer\"   specifically\n\nincludes any  person, \"resident or nonresident,\"  who makes cars.\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-1(B).  Thus, the Rhode Island legislature\n\nhas  clearly  expressed  an   intent  to  regulate   out-of-state\n\nmanufacturers when they  do business  in Rhode Island.   No  such\n\nexpression  exists with  regard to  out-of-state dealers  selling\n\ncars in another  state.   The absence of  any specification  that\n\n\"new  motor vehicle dealers\"  can include \"nonresidents\" confirms\n\nRIDOT's  interpretation  of  R.I.   Gen.  Laws     31-5.1-4.2  as\n\n                               -14-\n\nexcluding Fireside from the new dealership hearings.\n\n          Now  that we  have determined  that Rhode  Island's new\n\ndealership  law applies only to in-state  dealers, we can proceed\n\nto the task  of determining whether  RIDOT's action of  excluding\n\nFireside from  the new  dealership hearings was  a constitutional\n\nexercise of state power.\n\n          A.  Commerce Clause\n                             \n\n          The Commerce  Clause, while literally a  grant of power\n\nto  Congress,  also  restricts  states  from  passing  laws  that\n\ninterfere with interstate commerce.

Laws    31-5.1-4.2 does not  have the purpose\n\nof  discriminating against  interstate  commerce.   As  discussed\n\nabove, R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1 is designed to regulate automobile\n\ndealerships in the  state of Rhode Island,  and R.I. Gen.  Laws  \n\n31-5.1-4.2,  in particular,  is designed  to insure  that certain\n\nconditions  are met before  a new dealership  license is granted.\n\nRhode Island's  intent is to  protect Rhode Island  consumers and\n\nRhode  Island  dealers  from  certain  franchising  practices  of\n\nautomobile manufacturers  which are  perceived as harmful  to the\n\n                               -16-\n\nlocal community.

Because Rhode Island's new car dealership law does not\n\nfacially  apply  to  interstate  commerce,  it  cannot   facially\n\n                               -17-\n\ndiscriminate against interstate commerce.\n\n          We therefore turn to  the alleged discriminatory effect\n                                                                 \n\nof Rhode Island's new dealership  law.  R.I. Gen. Laws    31-5.1-\n\n4.2 does not place burdens on goods or services from out-of-state\n\nor on the out-of-state businesses that produce them.  The statute\n\nconcerns  the rights  and  obligations of  licensed Rhode  Island\n\ndealerships, a group that  does not include Fireside.   It simply\n\nhas no application whatsoever to Fireside.  The statute in no way\n\nhinders Fireside's ability  to sell cars to  Rhode Islanders; nor\n\ndoes  it increase  Fireside's cost of  doing business  with Rhode\n\nIsland.   These  facts  distinguish Rhode  Island's statute  from\n\nthose  statutes which the Supreme Court  has commonly struck down\n\nbecause  of their discriminatory effects.

Rhode Island's law clearly  does not\n\nhave the effect of burdening out-of-state businesses.\n\n          Instead, this  case falls  into the \"local  benefit\" or\n\n\"subsidy\"  category of cases -- that is, cases dealing with state\n\nlaws that confer a  benefit on businesses within the  state while\n\nwithholding  the  benefit  from  similarly  situated out-of-state\n\nbusinesses.   Fireside claims  that R.I.  Gen. Laws    31-5.1-4.2\n\ngrants to  Rhode Island  dealerships the privilege  of protesting\n\nthe establishment  of new car  dealerships at locations  close to\n\ntheir existing dealerships, thus  allowing them an opportunity to\n\nlimit their competition.  At the same time, Fireside argues, R.I.\n\nGen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2 denies the same  privilege to out-of-state\n\ndealers  in  the  same competitive  area.    The  result of  such\n\ndiscriminatory  effects,  Fireside  alleges,   is  to  drive  the\n\nestablishment of  new car dealerships out  towards Rhode Island's\n\nborders  where  they  can   divert  businesses  from  dealers  in\n\nneighboring  states   who  have   no  standing  to   protest  the\n\nestablishment of such dealerships at a good-cause hearing.\n\n          Supreme    Court   jurisprudence    on   discriminatory\n\nprivileges for  in-state business  under the Commerce  Clause is,\n\nunfortunately, somewhat  inconsistent.  On the  one hand, several\n\nstate laws  designed to promote  local industry have  been struck\n\ndown by the Court.  E.g., Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 112  S.

On the other  hand, the Court\n\nhas  repeatedly  affirmed  the long-recognized  proposition  that\n\nstates may directly subsidize  local industry as long as  they do\n\nso  without burdening  the ability  of interstate  competitors to\n\nsell their products  in the state.

See  Exxon Corp., 437 U.S.  at 126; West\n                                                                 \n\nLynn Creamery, 62 U.S.L.W. at 4520-22.\n             \n\n          R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2 does bestow  the benefit of\n\nprotesting new  dealerships on existing Rhode Island dealers in a\n\ncompetitive area which is not simultaneously extended to Fireside\n\nor other  out-of-state dealers  who are also  in the  competitive\n\narea.  This \"advantage  in the marketplace,\" however, is  not one\n\n\"in  connection   with  the  state's   regulation  of  interstate\n\ncommerce.\"  New Energy, 486 U.S. at 278.  The creation of new car\n                      \n\ndealerships in Rhode Island does not  relate to the price of  the\n\nautomobiles being sold, the taxes paid for them, or the costs and\n\nconditions of  selling them.  Moreover,  Rhode Island's procedure\n\nfor   protesting   new   dealerships   does  not   diminish   the\n\nopportunities  for Massachusetts  dealers to  sell cars  to Rhode\n\nIsland customers.  Rhode Island's efforts to license and regulate\n\n                               -21-\n\nin-state dealers is thus far afield from protectionist laws  that\n\nserve  to  enhance  economic  prosperity  of  local  citizens  by\n\nhindering the  free flow of  products or by  affording privileges\n\nprovided at the expense of out-of-state businesses.\n\n          Fireside claims  that denying it  the protest privilege\n\nprovided  by R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2 will have a differential\n\neffect on the number  of competitors a given car  dealership will\n\nface,  ultimately reducing the number of Rhode Islanders who will\n\ntravel  to Massachusetts to buy  shiny new Nissan  380-Z's.  This\n\ndiversionary effect is  present in all  subsidy cases and,  thus,\n\ncannot by  itself establish a  violation of the  Commerce Clause.\n\nIn this case, the  diversion of business  does not result from  a\n\ncomparative   advantage  in   the  marketplace  created   by  the\n\nchallenged state action that  would not normally exist in  a free\n\nmarket  for  new car  sales.   Consequently,  this case  does not\n\ninvolve a  practice that even comes  close to the types  of local\n\nsubsidies that  raise  Commerce Clause  concerns.   See  Hunt  v.\n                                                             \n\nWashington State Apple,  432 U.S. at 351-52  (striking down North\n                      \n\nCarolina  law because  it stripped  away advantages  that out-of-\n\nstate competitor  would normally have  in the free  market); Hyde\n                                                                 \n\nPark, 839 F.2d  at 843  (\"state action must  not 'neutralize  the\n    \n\neconomic consequences of free  trade among the states'\") (quoting\n\nBaldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U.S. 511, 526 (1935)).\n                              \n\n          The  mere act  of  granting a  dealership license  that\n\nmight  not otherwise  be  granted had  out-of-state dealers  been\n\nallowed  to protest  at the  hearing does not  mean that  the new\n\n                               -22-\n\ndealership will have  some preferential ability  to sell cars  to\n\nRhode Island customers.   Similarly, nothing in R.I. Gen.  Laws  \n\n31-5.1-4.2 affects Fireside's ability to sell a shinier Nissan at\n\na  better price, and a Rhode Islander's ability to take advantage\n\nof  such bargains.  The  effect of the law  is not to dictate the\n\nterms of competition between  businesses, but rather, to regulate\n\nthe  existence of  competitors.   Given these  circumstances, the\n\nfact that some theoretical  group of Rhode Island dealers  in the\n\ninterior of the state face  less competition from new dealerships\n\nallegedly  concentrated  on the  border  is  not significant  for\n\npurposes of a  Commerce Clause analysis.   The alleged beneficial\n\neffect of R.I. Gen. Laws    31-5.1-4.2 is too far afield from the\n\nprotectionism that the Commerce Clause prohibits.\n\n          This  case is  distinguishable  from  the  Bendix  case\n                                                           \n\nrelied on by Fireside for the proposition that the withholding of\n\n\"legal defenses or like  privileges\" from out-of-state businesses\n\ndiscriminates against interstate commerce.  Bendix Autolite Corp.\n                                                                 \n\nv. Midwesco  Enters., Inc., 486 U.S. 888, 893 (1988).  In Bendix,\n                                                                \n\nthe Supreme Court  struck down  an Ohio statute  that tolled  the\n\nstatute of  limitations (i.e. suspended  the running of  time) on\n\nfraud and  breach of contract  actions for  any foreign  business\n\nthat was not  \"present\" in the  state and  had not designated  an\n\nagent for  service of process.   Id.  To begin  with, the Supreme\n                                   \n\nCourt  never   determined  whether   or  not  the   Ohio  statute\n\ndiscriminated against interstate commerce.  Id. at 891.  Instead,\n                                              \n\nthe Court  based its finding on a balancing of the burdens of the\n\n                               -23-\n\nlaw  with the  justifications for the  law.   Id.   In any event,\n                                                \n\nBendix is  not applicable  to the  present case  for a number  of\n      \n\nreasons.\n\n          First,  the Bendix  Court found  that the  Ohio statute\n                            \n\nplaces a \"significant burden\" on out-of-state businesses  because\n\nit \"forces  a foreign corporation  to choose between  exposure to\n\nthe  general  jurisdiction of  Ohio courts  or forfeiture  of the\n\nlimitations  defense,  remaining  subject  to  suit  in  Ohio  in\n\nperpetuity.\"  Id.  at 893.   The statute thus affected  the costs\n                \n\nand conditions of doing  business in the state relative  to local\n\nbusinesses.\n\n          As  already noted, that is not the case here.  Fireside\n\ndoes not face any increased liability, or other burden that would\n\nincrease its cost of  doing business, by virtue of  its exclusion\n\nfrom the licensing hearings.   The only effect of  R.I. Gen. Laws\n\n  31-5.1-4.2 on Fireside is a relative  limitation on its ability\n\nto restrict the number  of competitors it will face,  an interest\n\nbeyond the purview  of the  Commerce Clause.   Legal defenses  in\n\ncontract  or   fraud  actions   are  simply  not   comparable  to\n\nparticipation  in a  local hearing  for the  granting of  a state\n\ndealership  license to a completely different  party.  The former\n\ninvolves \"an integral part of the legal system . .  . relied upon\n\nto project the liabilities of persons and  corporations active in\n\nthe commercial sphere.\"  Id.  The latter involves local licensing\n                           \n\nproceedings  that  have  nothing  to  do  with  the  out-of-state\n\nbusiness beyond its concern over the creation of a competitor.\n\n                               -24-\n\n          Furthermore, the  alleged protest  right in  this case,\n\nunlike  the statute of limitations defense in Bendix, is not part\n                                                    \n\nof a  statutory scheme  that applies to  out-of-state businesses.\n\nAs discussed above, R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2 is concerned with\n\nlocal  licenses and simply has  no application to  Fireside.  The\n\nstatute of limitations defense, however, is a part of the general\n\nscheme  of  civil  commercial   liability  that  applies  to  all\n\ncompanies with minimum contacts  to the state.  The  Ohio statute\n\nwas  thus purposefully  directed  to  out-of-state businesses  to\n\nrevoke  a procedural defense they  would normally enjoy.   In the\n\npresent case,  no benefit  was revoked  or withheld  from out-of-\n\nstate  parties because R.I. Gen. Laws    31-5.1-4.2 was concerned\n\nsolely with local  dealership licensing and was never intended to\n\nafford any benefits to out-of-state dealers in the first place.\n\n            2.

Gen. Laws    31-5.1-4.2, we  must\n\napply the more  lenient Pike balancing test  to determine whether\n                            \n\nthe law  imposes an  unreasonable burden on  interstate commerce.\n\nLaws that have  only an incidental impact  on interstate commerce\n\nwill  be upheld  so  long as  the  burden imposed  on  interstate\n\ncommerce is  not clearly  excessive in  relation to the  putative\n\nbenefits.

As discussed above,  no burdens are\n\nplaced  on an out-of-state dealer's ability to sell cars to Rhode\n\nIslanders.  The only effect on interstate commerce, theoretically\n\nanyway, appears to  be a decrease  in the number of  Rhode Island\n\ncustomers who go to Massachusetts to buy Nissans because  out-of-\n\nstate  dealers are not able  to protest the  establishment of new\n\nRhode  Island dealerships  near  the border.   This  diversionary\n\neffect,  however,  attributable  to  increased  competition  from\n\ncompetitors who  gain no  special competitive advantage  from the\n\nstate action, does not  implicate the Commerce Clause.   The free\n\nflow of goods remains  unaffected by R.I. Gen. Laws    31-5.1-4.2\n\nand  any changes in that flow  are due solely to consumers acting\n\nwithin  the free market.   See Minnesota v.  Clover Leaf Creamery\n                                                                 \n\nCo., 449 U.S. 456, 473-74 (1981) (upholding Minnesota law banning\n   \n\nthe  use  of plastic  milk  containers  even though  the  statute\n\nbenefitted  the  predominantly  local pulpwood  producers  at the\n\nexpense  of  the predominantly  out-of-state  plastics industry);\n\nExxon  Corp.,  437 U.S.  at  126-28  (upholding Maryland  statute\n            \n\nprohibiting  producers  and refiners  of petroleum  products from\n\noperating retail service stations within the state partly because\n\n\"in-state independent dealers will have no competitive  advantage\n\n                               -26-\n\nover out-of-state dealers\").\n\n          Given the lack of  any significant burden on interstate\n\ncommerce  in  this  case,  we  find  Rhode  Island's interest  in\n\nexcluding out-of-state parties from  participating in a matter of\n\nstrictly  local   concern  --  the  licensing   of  Rhode  Island\n\ndealerships -- more than sufficient to pass Constitutional muster\n\nunder the Pike balancing  test.  Certainly the state's  desire to\n              \n\nprotect  local dealers  and  consumers  from harmful  franchising\n\npractices is  a lawful legislative goal.   Even if we confine our\n\nanalysis  to  state  interests  that  are  directly  tied  to the\n\nrestriction  on who  can  participate in  hearings, however,  the\n\nstatute survives the balancing test.  Rhode Island's concerns for\n\nadministrative convenience and  the reasonable belief  that state\n\ncitizens  are  best  qualified   to  represent  local   interests\n\nsufficiently  justify  the   state's  exclusion  of  out-of-state\n\ndealers from the new dealership hearings.\n\n          B.

Laws   31-5.1-4.2 granted  this\n\ninterest  to Fireside  when  it bestowed  protest  rights on  all\n\ndealers within  the \"relevant market  area\" and  that RIDOT  then\n\ndeprived Fireside of  this right when  it excluded Fireside  from\n\nthe hearings.\n\n          The protections  of  procedural  due  process  are  not\n\ntriggered  unless Fireside  can show  it has  been deprived  of a\n\nprotectable liberty or property interest.

Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2  does not confer  any protections or\n\nrights of  participation on  out-of-state  dealers.   As we  have\n\nalready found, Rhode  Island's dealership licensing  statute only\n\napplies  to dealerships within the state of Rhode Island and does\n\nnot  have, nor has it  ever had, any  application to out-of-state\n\ndealers  like  Fireside.   Consequently,  RIDOT  did not  deprive\n\nFireside  of  any existing  property  interest  when it  excluded\n\nFireside  from its  hearing  on the  establishment of  Smithfield\n\nNissan.

A state's\n                  \n\nclassification is not unconstitutional simply because it \"'is not\n\nmade  with mathematical nicety or because  in practice it results\n\nin some  inequality.'\"    Dandridge, 397  U.S.  at  485  (quoting\n                                   \n\nLindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U.S. 61, 78 (1911)).\n                                    \n\n          Fireside claims that  RIDOT's application of R.I.  Gen.\n\nLaws   31-5.1-4.2 is not rationally related to the stated goal of\n\nprotecting Rhode  Island consumers and  Rhode Island  dealerships\n\n                               -29-\n\nfrom certain franchising  practices of automobile  manufacturers.\n\nFireside  argues that  excluding  out-of-state  dealers from  the\n\ngood-cause hearings  not  only  fails  to further  the  goals  of\n\nprotecting  consumers and dealers  but actually  undermines those\n\ngoals.   According to  Fireside, its exclusion  from the hearings\n\ngives Rhode Island regulators  a distorted view of the  \"relevant\n\nmarket  area\" by  understating  the  existing  competition  among\n\nautomobile franchises, resulting in  licensing decisions that are\n\ndetrimental  to Rhode  Island consumers  and dealers.   The  only\n\npurpose for excluding  out-of-state dealers, Fireside posits,  is\n\nthe illegitimate one of economic protectionism.\n\n          We  disagree with  Fireside's  contention that  RIDOT's\n\nexclusion of Fireside  bears no rational relationship to the goal\n\nof protecting Rhode Island consumers and car  dealers.  Excluding\n\nout-of-state parties  from hearings on matters  of strictly local\n\nconcern  is  a  reasonable  way  to  conduct  state  governmental\n\nbusiness.  We  find it  reasonable for Rhode  Island to  believe,\n\nrightly  or wrongly, that members  of its own  community are best\n\nqualified  to  represent   community  interests  to   regulators,\n\nincluding interests  concerning the  effect  of a  manufacturer's\n\nefforts to  establish a new  dealership on  existing dealers  and\n\nconsumers.    Out-of-state parties  may  be more  likely  to have\n\ninterests  that conflict  with local  interests.   Further, Rhode\n\nIsland's interest in  administrative convenience may justify  its\n\ndecision to cut off  the number of people participating  in state\n\ndecisionmaking  at  the  logical  point  of  state   citizenship.\n\n                               -30-\n\nWhether  more information  concerning out-of-state  dealers would\n\nbetter  serve Rhode  Island's  goal of  protecting consumers  and\n\ndealers  is irrelevant  for purposes  of rational  basis analysis\n\nunder  the Equal  Protection  Clause.    In  any  event,  we  are\n\nskeptical  of the  proposition  that Rhode  Island consumers  and\n\ndealers  are unable to fully  represent their own  interests at a\n\nhearing without the participation of out-of-state dealers.  If an\n\nexisting  Rhode Island  dealer or  a consumer  group finds  it in\n\ntheir interest  to present  information about  other out-of-state\n\ndealerships, nothing in the law prevents them from doing so.\n\n          Finally, we find that Rhode Island did not purposefully\n\ndiscriminate against Fireside by excluding it from new dealership\n\nhearings for the sole purpose of furthering the illegitimate goal\n\nof economic protectionism.  See Snowden v. Hughes,  321 U.S. 1, 8\n                                                 \n\n(1944).   As already discussed above, R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2\n\nwas designed and  intended to regulate  and protect licensed  car\n\ndealerships  in Rhode Island and was not intended nor designed to\n\nbenefit   local  businesses  at   the  expense   of  out-of-state\n\ncompetitors.   We therefore  uphold the district  court's holding\n\nthat RIDOT did not violate Fireside's constitutional rights.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -31-\n",

Rhode  Island's automobile\n                                   \n\ndealership  law  allows  existing dealers  within  a  twenty-mile\n\nradius of a proposed new dealership to protest  the establishment\n\nof  the new dealership.  The issue raised by this appeal concerns\n\nsituations  in which, by reason  of a proposed  new dealership in\n\nproximity  to the state border, a part of that twenty-mile radius\n\nfalls  outside of Rhode Island.   State officials  have taken the\n\nposition that within the  twenty-mile area surrounding a proposed\n\nnew dealership,  only the  dealers who  are located  inside Rhode\n\nIsland's borders are  covered by  Rhode Island law  and thus  are\n\nentitled to protest the  establishment of the new dealership.   A\n\nMassachusetts car  dealer who  is located within  the twenty-mile\n\nradius  of a  proposed dealership,  but in  Massachusetts, claims\n\nthat  this interpretation of Rhode  Island law runs  afoul of the\n\nCommerce  Clause because  it  burdens  and discriminates  against\n\ninterstate commerce.  Because Rhode Island is merely applying its\n\nlaw to those  subject to its jurisdiction and  regulation, rather\n\nthan  extraterritorially,  and  because  it  neither burdens  nor\n\ndiscriminates  against interstate  commerce  in the  process,  we\n\nagree with Rhode Island and affirm.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Plaintiff-appellant Fireside Nissan, Inc. (\"Fireside\"),\n\na Massachusetts  automobile dealer,  brought this  action against\n\nthe  Rhode  Island Department  of Transportation  (\"RIDOT\") after\n\nRIDOT excluded Fireside from participating in  hearings regarding\n\na proposed Nissan  dealership in Rhode Island.   Fireside claimed\n\n                               -2-\n\nthat RIDOT's application of Rhode Island's new dealership law  to\n\nexclude  Fireside merely  because  it was  not  located in  Rhode\n\nIsland was unconstitutional.\n\n          Rhode  Island  General Laws,  Section  31-5.1-4.21 sets\n\nout  certain  procedural  requirements  for  establishing  a  new\n\nautomobile  dealership  in  the  state.   First,  a  manufacturer\n\ndesiring  an additional  dealership must  notify dealers  \"in the\n\nrelevant market  area\" of its intentions.   R.I. Gen. Laws    31-\n\n5.1-4.2(a).   \"Relevant  market  area\" is  defined  as \"the  area\n\nwithin a radius of twenty (20) miles around an existing dealer or\n\nthe area of responsibility defined in the franchise, whichever is\n\ngreater.\"   R.I Gen. Laws   31-5.1-1(J).  Existing retail dealers\n\nin the \"relevant  market area\" may then protest the establishment\n\n                    \n\n1  R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2 provides in relevant part:\n\n            (a)  In  the  event  that  a manufacturer\n            seeks   to   enter   into   a   franchise\n            establishing  an   additional  new  motor\n            vehicle dealership . . . within or into a\n            relevant  market area where the same line\n            make  is  then  represented,  .  . .  the\n            manufacturer   shall    in   writing   by\n            certified    mail   first    notify   the\n            department  .  .  . and  each  new  motor\n            vehicle dealer in  such line make  in the\n            relevant market area . . .  .  [A]ny such\n            new  motor  vehicle  dealership may  file\n            with  the  department  a  protest  to the\n            establishing  or  relocating  of the  new\n            motor vehicle  dealership .  . . .   When\n            such  a  protest  is  filed, .  .  .  the\n            manufacturer   shall  not   establish  or\n            relocate the proposed  new motor  vehicle\n            dealership .  . .   until the  department\n            has held a hearing, nor thereafter, until\n            the  department has  determined [whether]\n            there  is good  cause for  not permitting\n            such new motor vehicle dealership.\n\n                               -3-\n\nof the new dealership in which case RIDOT must hold  a hearing to\n\ndetermine  if  \"there  is  good cause  for  not  permitting\"  the\n\nadditional  franchise.   R.I.  Gen. Laws     31-5.1-4.2(a).   The\n\nstatute  does not explicitly state whether or not the dealers who\n\nmay  protest the establishment  of a dealership  in the \"relevant\n\nmarket area\"  must be located  in Rhode Island  or be  a licensed\n\nRhode Island dealership.2\n\n          In March  of 1991,  Nissan Motor Corporation  in U.S.A.\n\n(\"Nissan USA\"), gave notice to  RIDOT, Fireside, and other Nissan\n\ndealers of its intention to establish a dealership in Smithfield,\n\nRhode  Island.    Fireside,   which  sells  and  services  Nissan\n\n                    \n\n2   Throughout Title  31  of the  Motor  Vehicle Code,  the  term\n\"dealer\" is defined as: \n\n            Every  person engaged in  the business of\n            buying,  selling, or  exchanging vehicles\n            of  a  type  required  to  be  registered\n            hereunder  and  who  has  an  established\n            place  of  business for  such  purpose in\n                                                     \n            this state.\n                      \n\nR.I. Gen. Laws   31-1-19 (emphasis added).\n\nFor purposes of the provision regarding the  establishment of new\ncar dealerships, R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2, however, the  right\nto protest at a hearing applies to any \"new motor vehicle dealer\"\nwhich is defined as:\n\n            [A]ny person  engaged in the  business of\n            selling, offering to sell,  soliciting or\n            advertising   the   sale  of   new  motor\n            vehicles and  who holds, or  held at  the\n            time a cause of action under this chapter\n            accrued,  a  valid   sales  and   service\n            agreement, franchise or contract, granted\n            by  the  manufacturer or  distributor for\n            the retail sale of said manufacturer's or\n            distributor's new motor vehicles.\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-1(C).\n\n                               -4-\n\nautomobiles,   is  located  in  North  Attleboro,  Massachusetts,\n\napproximately two miles  from the Rhode Island  border and within\n\ntwenty  miles  of Smithfield.    Fireside  is therefore  squarely\n\nwithin the  \"relevant market area\" of  the Smithfield dealership.\n\nFireside  is not a licensed automobile dealer in Rhode Island but\n\ninstead holds a Massachusetts dealership license.\n\n          In response  to Nissan  USA's notice, Fireside  filed a\n\nprotest with RIDOT on April 12, 1991.  Three Rhode Island dealers\n\nof Nissan automobiles, who were  also within the \"relevant market\n\narea,\" filed protests  with RIDOT as well.  On February 13, 1992,\n\nRIDOT issued a notice  to Fireside and the other  dealers stating\n\nthat  it  was  scheduling  a  hearing  regarding  the  Smithfield\n\ndealership on April 2, 1992.\n\n          At the  hearing, Nissan  USA moved to  exclude Fireside\n\nbecause it was an out-of state dealer.  RIDOT, acting through the\n\nRhode Island Dealer's License  and Regulations Office, determined\n\nthat Fireside lacked  standing to participate in the  hearing and\n\nexcluded Fireside  from presenting  witnesses or evidence  at the\n\nhearing.  The three  Rhode Island dealers did participate  at the\n\nhearing and presented evidence on their own behalf.\n\n          Fireside  was  prepared  to  present  evidence  at  the\n\nhearing  showing  that 48%  of Fireside's  sales  and 45%  of its\n\nservice  business went to  Rhode Island residents.   In addition,\n\nFireside would have established that 100% of its cable television\n\nadvertising and 75%  of its  print advertising is  done in  Rhode\n\nIsland.\n\n                               -5-\n\n          After  the hearing,  RIDOT determined  that good  cause\n\nexisted  for  the  establishment of  the  Smithfield  dealership.\n\nAccording  to R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2(b), RIDOT must base its\n\ndetermination of  \"good  cause\" on  the \"existing  circumstances,\n\nincluding, but not limited to:\"\n\n            (1)   Permanency of the investment of the\n            existing new motor  vehicle dealer(s)  in\n            the community;\n\n            (2)    Whether  the  new   motor  vehicle\n            dealers  of the  same  line make  in that\n            relevant   market   area  are   providing\n            adequate  consumer care . . . which shall\n            include  the  adequacy  of motor  vehicle\n            sales and  service facilities, equipment,\n            supply  of  motor   vehicle  parts,   and\n            qualified service personnel;\n\n            (3)  Whether there is reasonable evidence\n            that  after the granting of the new motor\n            vehicle dealership, that [sic] the market\n            would  support all of  the dealerships of\n            that  line  make in  the  relevant market\n            area;\n\n            (4)      Consequently,   whether  it   is\n            injurious  to the  public welfare  for an\n            additional  new motor  vehicle dealership\n            to be established.\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2(b).\n\nUpon consideration of these factors, RIDOT found cause to issue a\n\nlicense  to  the Smithfield  dealership,  which is  now  known as\n\nNissan of Smithfield, Inc. (\"Smithfield Nissan\").\n\n          Fireside commenced this action on April 9, 1992, naming\n\nDaniel  Fanning, Director  of RIDOT as  the defendant.   Fireside\n\nsought a  declaration that RIDOT's interpretation  of Section 31-\n\n5.1-4.2  as excluding  Fireside from  the new  dealership hearing\n\nviolated  the  Commerce  Clause, the  Privileges  and  Immunities\n\n                               -6-\n\nClause, the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of\n\nthe  United  States  Constitution.     Fireside  also  sought  an\n\ninjunction  restraining  RIDOT   from  precluding  Fireside  from\n\nparticipating  in   future  hearings  as  well   as  a  temporary\n\nrestraining order  and a preliminary  injunction enjoining  RIDOT\n\nfrom granting  a dealership license to Smithfield Nissan.  Nissan\n\nUSA and Smithfield Nissan intervened in the action.\n\n          The district court denied Fireside's  requested relief.\n\nThe  court  found  that  the   exclusion  of  Fireside  from  the\n\ndealership  hearings  did  not  violate the  Commerce  Clause  or\n\notherwise violate Fireside's constitutional rights.  As a result,\n\nFireside could not show the irreparable harm or the likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits necessary for the granting of a preliminary\n\ninjunction.   The  court also  denied  Fireside's request  for  a\n\ndeclaratory  judgment and  a permanent  injunction and  entered a\n\nfinal  judgment  in favor  of RIDOT,  Nissan USA,  and Smithfield\n\nNissan.\n\n                          II.  ANALYSIS\n\n          Fireside's right to its requested relief, including the\n\npreliminary   and  permanent  injunctions   and  the  declaratory\n\njudgment, depends primarily on  whether the exclusion of Fireside\n\nfrom RIDOT's  new dealership hearings violates  the Constitution.\n\nBefore the  court will  grant a preliminary  injunction, Fireside\n\nmust establish, among other things, that it faces a likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits and that it will suffer irreparable harm if\n\nthe injunction  is  not issued.

Because\n\nwe uphold the district court's finding that RIDOT did not violate\n\nthe Commerce  Clause or any of  Fireside's constitutional rights,\n\nwe affirm the final judgment in favor of the defendants.\n\n          As  a preliminary matter, we  find it beneficial to our\n\nconstitutional inquiry to clarify the  nature and purpose of  the\n\nRhode Island new dealership statute, R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2.\n\nTitle 31 of Rhode Island General Laws governs state regulation of\n\nmotor  and other vehicles.   Chapter 5.1 of  that title regulates\n\nbusiness practices among motor vehicle manufacturers, dealers and\n\ndistributors.   The provision  covering the establishment  of new\n\nautomobile dealerships, R.I. Gen.  Laws   31-5.1-4.2, is designed\n\nto protect  existing dealers  and consumers from  the detrimental\n\neffects  of aggressive  franchising practices  by the  automobile\n\nmanufacturers  whose  efforts  to  establish  excessive competing\n\nfranchises  are considered  to be  potentially \"injurious  to the\n\npublic welfare\" if not properly regulated.  R.I.  Gen. Laws   31-\n\n5.1-4.2(b).\n\n                               -8-\n\n          The district court found that the statute targeted only\n\nactivities which occur within the state of Rhode Island performed\n\nby  businesses  seeking   or  holding  Rhode  Island   dealership\n\nlicenses.   According to the  court, R.I. Gen.  Laws   31-5.1-4.2\n\nwas designed  to  safeguard the  interests of  those dealers  and\n\nconsumers located  in Rhode Island; the  Rhode Island legislature\n\ndid not  intend for the statute  to apply to, or  for the benefit\n\nof,  out-of-state dealers  such as  Fireside.   As a  result, the\n\ncourt  concluded  that  RIDOT  properly applied  the  statute  by\n\nexcluding Fireside from the new dealership hearings.\n\n          We  agree with  the  district court's  finding on  this\n\nissue.   Taking its cue from the Sixth Circuit, which interpreted\n\na similar Kentucky statute as excluding out-of-state dealers from\n\nnew  dealership hearings, BMW  Stores, Inc. v.  Peugeot Motors of\n                                                                 \n\nAm., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513305\"><a href=\"/opinion/513305/the-bmw-stores-inc-v-peugeot-motors-of-america-inc-eastern-auto/\"><span class=\"volume\">860</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(6th Cir. 1988), the district court based\n         \n\nits  analysis on the stated purposes and language of the statute,\n\nthe  interpretation of  the statute  by  state regulators  and on\n\ngeneral principles  of statutory  construction.  Because  we find\n\nthe  first  two factors  to  be the  relevant  considerations, we\n\ndiscuss them below.\n\n          Although  R.I.   Gen.  Laws      31-5.1-4.2  does   not\n\nexplicitly include or exclude  out-of-state dealers, the declared\n\npolicy  of the statute  indicates a  concern for  protecting only\n\nRhode Island dealers and  residents.  As in  BMW Stores, the  new\n                                                       \n\ndealership  licensing  provision  is  aimed  at  protecting  \"the\n\ninvestment of  the existing  new motor vehicle  dealer[s] in  the\n\n                               -9-\n\ncommunity\" and safeguarding the \"public welfare.\"  R.I.

R.I. Gen.  Laws.    31-5.1-1  through 31-5.1-20.\n\nNone of these duties and obligations apply to Fireside because it\n\nis  not licensed  in Rhode Island.   Accordingly,  the privileges\n\nthat  correspond to such duties  and obligations do  not apply to\n\nFireside  either.    The   new  dealership  provision,  with  its\n\nprocedure for  hearings,  is  simply part  and  parcel  of  Rhode\n\nIsland's regulation and licensing of local dealerships.  It makes\n\nno  sense,  therefore,  to  apply  Rhode  Island's  comprehensive\n\nregulatory scheme for the benefit of out-of-state dealers.\n\n          Furthermore,   as  in  BMW   Stores,  state  regulatory\n                                             \n\nofficials have interpreted the  state's new dealership statute as\n\n                    \n\n3   We do not attach  any significance, as does  Fireside, to the\nuse  of the word \"community\" in Rhode Island's statute instead of\nthe words \"citizens of this state\" in the Kentucky statute.  Both\nterms  evidence the legislature's concern with the welfare of the\npublic  which  it is  charged  with protecting.    Also, Fireside\nincorrectly  claims that  the Kentucky  statute differs  from the\nRhode Island  statute  because Kentucky's  does  not state  as  a\npurpose  the safeguarding  of the general  public interest.   The\nKentucky  statute  explicitly  states  that its  purpose  is  the\npromotion  of  \"the  public  interest  and  public  welfare\"  and\nmentions  as  one of  its concerns  the provision  of \"convenient\nconsumer  care,\" which  clearly  indicates the  same concern  for\nconsumers and the public  as the Rhode Island statute.

Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2 applies to out-of-\n\nstate dealers.   Fireside points  to the fact that,  prior to the\n\nhearing for Smithfield Nissan,  RIDOT promulgated proposed  rules\n\nand  regulations  that included  a  provision,  Section XI,  that\n\nexplicitly  excluded  out-of-state  dealers from  protesting  new\n\ndealerships and  participating in hearings.  The  final rules and\n\nregulations,  however, were issued  without adopting  Section XI.\n\nFireside argues that the failure to adopt Section XI indicates an\n\nintent  to  include out-of-state  dealers  in the  hearings.   We\n\ndisagree.\n\n          First of all, the proposed Section XI, while precluding\n\nout-of-state dealers from cross-examining witnesses or presenting\n\nevidence, did allow  for out-of-state dealers to offer  verbal or\n\nwritten statements  at the hearings  at RIDOT's discretion.   The\n\nproposal thus could be interpreted as granting more participation\n\nrights to  out-of-state dealers than they  would otherwise enjoy.\n\nAs a result, we do not  know if the proposal was rejected because\n\nit  was too permissive or  because it was  too restrictive, i.e.,\n\nbecause it  removed out-of-state participation rights  that RIDOT\n\nthought out-of-state  dealers should  have or because  it granted\n\nnew  rights that  RIDOT thought  out-of-state dealers  should not\n\nhave.     RIDOT's  failure  to  promulgate  Section  XI  is  thus\n\n                               -11-\n\ninconclusive.  Secondly, RIDOT's current regulations for R.I. 31-\n\n5.1 state that their purpose is:\n\n            (a) . . . to protect the interests of the\n            public  when  dealing with  motor vehicle\n            dealers in Rhode Island . . . .\n                                   \n\n            (b) . . .  to implement the provisions of\n            Sections  31-5  and 31-5.1  regarding the\n            issuance, suspension and/or revocation of\n            such  licenses as well  as the regulation\n            of    business   practices    among   the\n                                                     \n            businesses   seeking  or   holding  those\n                                                     \n            licenses. (emphasis added)\n                    \n\nThis  demonstrates RIDOT's intent to  apply R.I. Gen.  Laws   31-\n\n5.1-4.2 only to Rhode Island dealerships.  In any event, the only\n\nevidence we have of RIDOT actually taking a stand on the specific\n\nissue before us is RIDOT's actions in this case.  RIDOT  excluded\n\nFireside  from the  hearings and thereby  affirmatively expressed\n\nits interpretation  of  R.I. Gen.  Laws    31-5.1-4.2 as  barring\n\nparticipation of out-of-state dealers in new dealership hearings.\n\n          Fireside maintains that certain language in the statute\n\nexpresses an  intent to  include Fireside in  the new  dealership\n\nhearings.    Fireside notes  that  it  falls within  the  literal\n\ndefinition of  a \"new motor vehicle dealer\"  inside the \"relevant\n\nmarket area\" for purposes of R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2, because\n\nthe  definition  of  \"new  motor vehicle  dealer\"  includes  \"any\n\nperson\"  selling  cars, R.I.  Gen.  Laws    31-5.1-1(C),  and the\n\n\"relevant  market area\" is the  area within a  twenty mile radius\n\naround an existing  dealer, R.I.  Gen. Laws    31-5.1-1(J).   The\n\nlack of an  explicit statement  that the  \"relevant market  area\"\n\nstops  at the state border  does not, however,  indicate that the\n\n                               -12-\n\nstate affirmatively  intended to include out-of-state  dealers in\n\nlicensing hearings.  On the  contrary, the definition of \"dealer\"\n\nfor all of Title 31 of  Rhode Island's General Laws is limited to\n\npersons who  have  an  established place  of  business  \"in  this\n\nstate.\"  R.I.  Gen. Laws   31-1-19(a).  Fireside  is correct that\n\nthe  definition  of \"new  motor vehicle  dealer\"  as used  in the\n\nlicensing section at  issue here,  R.I. Gen.  Laws    31-5.1-4.2,\n\ndoes  not contain this limitation.  R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-1(C).\n\nHowever, the term \"relevant  market area,\" the other key  term in\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2, is  defined as a twenty mile  radius\n\n\"around an existing dealer,\"  employing the general term \"dealer\"\n                          \n\nfrom 31-1-19(a) and not \"new motor vehicle dealer\" from   31-5.1-\n\n1(C).  One could  thus interpret R.I. Gen.  Laws   31-5.1-4.2  as\n\ngranting protest rights only  to Rhode Island dealerships because\n\nonly Rhode Island dealers can be in a \"relevant market area.\"\n\n          Fireside also points to  R.I. Gen. Laws    31-5.1-2 for\n\nevidence  that  the licensing  provision applies  to out-of-state\n\ndealers.  R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-2 states:\n\n            Any  person  who   engages  directly   or\n            indirectly in  purposeful contacts within\n            this   state   in  connection   with  the\n            offering or advertising  for sale or  has\n            business dealings with respect to a motor\n            vehicle within the state shall be subject\n            to  the  provisions of  this  chapter and\n            shall be  subject to the  jurisdiction of\n            the courts of this state, upon service of\n            process in accordance with the provisions\n            of the general laws.\n\nThis provision is not a general  grant of extraterritoriality but\n\nrather an affirmation that parties who are covered by the various\n\n                               -13-\n\nsubstantive  provisions  in  Chapter   5.1  of  Title  31,  which\n\nregulates manufacturers, dealers and distributors,  cannot escape\n\nenforcement   of   those   provisions   by  claiming   they   are\n\nnonresidents.   If  Fireside's interpretation  were adopted,  the\n\nsubstantive regulatory provisions in  Chapter 5.1 -- for example,\n\nthose  regarding fraud and breach  of warranty --  would apply to\n\nFireside  and  any other  dealer in  any  other state,  an absurd\n\nresult.   Notwithstanding  R.I. Gen.  Laws    31-5.1-2,  one must\n\nstill look to the specific  substantive provisions of Chapter 5.1\n\nto see who is covered.  Doing so reveals that   31-5.2 was mainly\n\ndirected  toward  out-of-state  automobile manufacturers,  rather\n                                                        \n\nthan dealers.  A majority of the provisions in chapter 5.1 impose\n\nexplicit duties and  obligations on manufacturers, all or most of\n\nwhom, presumably,  are,  like Nissan  USA,  from outside  of  the\n\nstate.   E.g.,  R.I.  Gen. Laws      31-5.1-4 through  31-5.1-11.\n             \n\nUnlike  the  definition  of  \"new  motor  vehicle  dealer\"  which\n\nincludes  generally \"any person\"  selling cars, R.I.  Gen. Laws  \n\n31-5.1-1(C),  the  definition   of  \"manufacturer\"   specifically\n\nincludes any  person, \"resident or nonresident,\"  who makes cars.\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-1(B).  Thus, the Rhode Island legislature\n\nhas  clearly  expressed  an   intent  to  regulate   out-of-state\n\nmanufacturers when they  do business  in Rhode Island.   No  such\n\nexpression  exists with  regard to  out-of-state dealers  selling\n\ncars in another  state.   The absence of  any specification  that\n\n\"new  motor vehicle dealers\"  can include \"nonresidents\" confirms\n\nRIDOT's  interpretation  of  R.I.   Gen.  Laws     31-5.1-4.2  as\n\n                               -14-\n\nexcluding Fireside from the new dealership hearings.\n\n          Now  that we  have determined  that Rhode  Island's new\n\ndealership  law applies only to in-state  dealers, we can proceed\n\nto the task  of determining whether  RIDOT's action of  excluding\n\nFireside from  the new  dealership hearings was  a constitutional\n\nexercise of state power.\n\n          A.

Because Rhode Island's new car dealership law does not\n\nfacially  apply  to  interstate  commerce,  it  cannot   facially\n\n                               -17-\n\ndiscriminate against interstate commerce.\n\n          We therefore turn to  the alleged discriminatory effect\n                                                                 \n\nof Rhode Island's new dealership  law.

Rhode Island's law clearly  does not\n\nhave the effect of burdening out-of-state businesses.\n\n          Instead, this  case falls  into the \"local  benefit\" or\n\n\"subsidy\"  category of cases -- that is, cases dealing with state\n\nlaws that confer a  benefit on businesses within the  state while\n\nwithholding  the  benefit  from  similarly  situated out-of-state\n\nbusinesses.   Fireside claims  that R.I.  Gen. Laws    31-5.1-4.2\n\ngrants to  Rhode Island  dealerships the privilege  of protesting\n\nthe establishment  of new car  dealerships at locations  close to\n\ntheir existing dealerships, thus  allowing them an opportunity to\n\nlimit their competition.  At the same time, Fireside argues, R.I.\n\nGen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2 denies the same  privilege to out-of-state\n\ndealers  in  the  same competitive  area.    The  result of  such\n\ndiscriminatory  effects,  Fireside  alleges,   is  to  drive  the\n\nestablishment of  new car dealerships out  towards Rhode Island's\n\nborders  where  they  can   divert  businesses  from  dealers  in\n\nneighboring  states   who  have   no  standing  to   protest  the\n\nestablishment of such dealerships at a good-cause hearing.\n\n          Supreme    Court   jurisprudence    on   discriminatory\n\nprivileges for  in-state business  under the Commerce  Clause is,\n\nunfortunately, somewhat  inconsistent.

The creation of new car\n                      \n\ndealerships in Rhode Island does not  relate to the price of  the\n\nautomobiles being sold, the taxes paid for them, or the costs and\n\nconditions of  selling them.  Moreover,  Rhode Island's procedure\n\nfor   protesting   new   dealerships   does  not   diminish   the\n\nopportunities  for Massachusetts  dealers to  sell cars  to Rhode\n\nIsland customers.  Rhode Island's efforts to license and regulate\n\n                               -21-\n\nin-state dealers is thus far afield from protectionist laws  that\n\nserve  to  enhance  economic  prosperity  of  local  citizens  by\n\nhindering the  free flow of  products or by  affording privileges\n\nprovided at the expense of out-of-state businesses.\n\n          Fireside claims  that denying it  the protest privilege\n\nprovided  by R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2 will have a differential\n\neffect on the number  of competitors a given car  dealership will\n\nface,  ultimately reducing the number of Rhode Islanders who will\n\ntravel  to Massachusetts to buy  shiny new Nissan  380-Z's.  This\n\ndiversionary effect is  present in all  subsidy cases and,  thus,\n\ncannot by  itself establish a  violation of the  Commerce Clause.\n\nIn this case, the  diversion of business  does not result from  a\n\ncomparative   advantage  in   the  marketplace  created   by  the\n\nchallenged state action that  would not normally exist in  a free\n\nmarket  for  new car  sales.   Consequently,  this case  does not\n\ninvolve a  practice that even comes  close to the types  of local\n\nsubsidies that  raise  Commerce Clause  concerns.

The  effect of the law  is not to dictate the\n\nterms of competition between  businesses, but rather, to regulate\n\nthe  existence of  competitors.   Given these  circumstances, the\n\nfact that some theoretical  group of Rhode Island dealers  in the\n\ninterior of the state face  less competition from new dealerships\n\nallegedly  concentrated  on the  border  is  not significant  for\n\npurposes of a  Commerce Clause analysis.

The only effect of  R.I. Gen.

The  Ohio statute\n\nwas  thus purposefully  directed  to  out-of-state businesses  to\n\nrevoke  a procedural defense they  would normally enjoy.   In the\n\npresent case,  no benefit  was revoked  or withheld  from out-of-\n\nstate  parties because R.I. Gen.

On\n\nappeal, Fireside argues that it has a protected property interest\n\nin the form of a legitimate claim of entitlement to  be free from\n\n\"excessive intrabrand competition\" in the market for new Nissans.\n\n                               -27-\n\nFireside maintains that R.I. Gen. Laws   31-5.1-4.2 granted  this\n\ninterest  to Fireside  when  it bestowed  protest  rights on  all\n\ndealers within  the \"relevant market  area\" and  that RIDOT  then\n\ndeprived Fireside of  this right when  it excluded Fireside  from\n\nthe hearings.\n\n          The protections  of  procedural  due  process  are  not\n\ntriggered  unless Fireside  can show  it has  been deprived  of a\n\nprotectable liberty or property interest.

Gen.\n\nLaws   31-5.1-4.2 is not rationally related to the stated goal of\n\nprotecting Rhode  Island consumers and  Rhode Island  dealerships\n\n                               -29-\n\nfrom certain franchising  practices of automobile  manufacturers.\n\nFireside  argues that  excluding  out-of-state  dealers from  the\n\ngood-cause hearings  not  only  fails  to further  the  goals  of\n\nprotecting  consumers and dealers  but actually  undermines those\n\ngoals.   According to  Fireside, its exclusion  from the hearings\n\ngives Rhode Island regulators  a distorted view of the  \"relevant\n\nmarket  area\" by  understating  the  existing  competition  among\n\nautomobile franchises, resulting in  licensing decisions that are\n\ndetrimental  to Rhode  Island consumers  and dealers.   The  only\n\npurpose for excluding  out-of-state dealers, Fireside posits,  is\n\nthe illegitimate one of economic protectionism.\n\n          We  disagree with  Fireside's  contention that  RIDOT's\n\nexclusion of Fireside  bears no rational relationship to the goal\n\nof protecting Rhode Island consumers and car  dealers.  Excluding\n\nout-of-state parties  from hearings on matters  of strictly local\n\nconcern  is  a  reasonable  way  to  conduct  state  governmental\n\nbusiness.  We  find it  reasonable for Rhode  Island to  believe,\n\nrightly  or wrongly, that members  of its own  community are best\n\nqualified  to  represent   community  interests  to   regulators,\n\nincluding interests  concerning the  effect  of a  manufacturer's\n\nefforts to  establish a new  dealership on  existing dealers  and\n\nconsumers.    Out-of-state parties  may  be more  likely  to have\n\ninterests  that conflict  with local  interests.   Further, Rhode\n\nIsland's interest in  administrative convenience may justify  its\n\ndecision to cut off  the number of people participating  in state\n\ndecisionmaking  at  the  logical  point  of  state   citizenship.\n\n                               -30-\n\nWhether  more information  concerning out-of-state  dealers would\n\nbetter  serve Rhode  Island's  goal of  protecting consumers  and\n\ndealers  is irrelevant  for purposes  of rational  basis analysis\n\nunder  the Equal  Protection  Clause.    In  any  event,  we  are\n\nskeptical  of the  proposition  that Rhode  Island consumers  and\n\ndealers  are unable to fully  represent their own  interests at a\n\nhearing without the participation of out-of-state dealers.  If an\n\nexisting  Rhode Island  dealer or  a consumer  group finds  it in\n\ntheir interest  to present  information about  other out-of-state\n\ndealerships, nothing in the law prevents them from doing so.\n\n          Finally, we find that Rhode Island did not purposefully\n\ndiscriminate against Fireside by excluding it from new dealership\n\nhearings for the sole purpose of furthering the illegitimate goal\n\nof economic protectionism.

Hughes,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103921\"><a href=\"/opinion/103921/snowden-v-hughes/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8\n                                                 \n\n(1944).   As already discussed above, R.I. Gen.

We therefore  uphold the district  court's holding\n\nthat RIDOT did not violate Fireside's constitutional rights.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -31-\n</pre>",
