DuBose,\r                                                                             \r\nAssistant United  States Attorney, on Motion for Summary Dismissal for\r\nappellees.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per Curiam.   Appellant appeals from  the denial of\r                                \r\n\nher Rule 60(b)(4)  motion.   She contends  that a  forfeiture\r\n\ndecree  is void because she did not receive sufficient notice\r\n\nof the  forfeiture proceedings to  satisfy due process.   For\r\n\nthe reasons  which follow, we conclude that  appellant is not\r\n\nentitled to relief.\r\n\n          The   district   court   afforded    appellant   an\r\n\nopportunity  to  prove that  she  had suffered  damages  as a\r\n\nresult of the due process violation, but  appellant failed to\r\n\nappear at  the hearing, and  damages were denied.   Appellant\r\n\nhas  not  challenged the  denial  of damages  on  appeal, but\r\n\nrather seeks  a determination that the  forfeiture decree was\r\n\nvoid because of the due process violation.  She contends that\r\n\nthe purchaser  from the  government  could acquire  no  valid\r\n\ntitle  under a void judgment, and her intent is apparently to\r\n\nproceed  against the  purchaser if  the forfeiture  decree is\r\n\ndeclared void.\r\n\n          We will assume without deciding that  appellant had\r\n\nsome possessory interest in  the res entitling her to  notice\r\n\nof the forfeiture proceedings and that the government  failed\r\n\nto accord her sufficient notice, thereby violating her  right\r\n\nto  due process.   Nevertheless,  because appellant,  despite\r\n\nample  opportunity, has  failed adequately  to describe  what\r\n\nproperty interest she claims to have had, she is not entitled\r\n\nto Rule 60(b)(4) relief.\r\n\n          The record  owner, as well  as appellant's husband,\r\n\nJohn Burke, were served in  the forfeiture action, and  their\r\n\nrights in  the property  have been effectively  extinguished.\r\n\nSo far as we are aware, they have not collaterally challenged\r\r\n\nthe forfeiture decree as void.  In other words, the decree is\r\n\nvalid as  to their interests.   To prevail then  in her quest\r\n\nagainst  the  purchaser,  appellant  would  need  to  show  a\r\n\nproperty  interest that  could survive the  extinguishment of\r\n\nthe record owner's  and John Burke's.   She has failed  to do\r\n\nthis, and consequently we  conclude that appellant has failed\r\n\nto establish  that  she  is entitled  to  relief  under  Rule\r\n\n60(b)(4).\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
