On  December  4, 1991,  a\n                                    \n\nfederal  grand  jury  indicted appellant  Priscilla  Jackson  and\n\ncodefendant Juan Familia, charging conspiracy  to possess cocaine\n\nwith  intent to distribute it (Count I) and possession of cocaine\n\nwith intent to distribute it  (Count II).  See 21 U.S.C.     846,\n                                              \n\n841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(C).  Familia, whose appeal is not part of\n\nthis case,  was also charged with  using a firearm  during and in\n\nrelation to a drug trafficking crime  in violation of 18 U.S.C.  \n\n924(c).  Jackson  was not charged  with this third count.   After\n\ntrial, a jury convicted both defendants  on Counts I and II,  but\n\nacquitted Familia of the firearm charge.  Jackson does not appeal\n\nher conviction, but contests  the district court's calculation of\n\nher  guideline sentencing range (\"GSR\")  on several grounds.  For\n\nthe reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n                                I\n                                 \n\n          On November 11, 1991,  police officers from Providence,\n\nRhode Island went to execute a search warrant at the second floor\n\napartment of  142 Bowdoin  Street, Providence.   At approximately\n\n7:00 p.m., Familia departed from the apartment and drove away  in\n\na Dodge minivan.   The officers stopped the vehicle  and returned\n\nwith Familia to his apartment.  \n\n          They entered  the kitchen  through the rear  door using\n\nFamilia's  keys.    The  kitchen  leads  directly to  the  master\n\nbedroom, which contained  a bed,  a crib, an  upright dresser,  a\n\nbureau  and a television table.  Jackson  was on the bed with the\n\ncouple's child.\n\n          Upon entering the apartment,  Familia declared:  \"All I\n\nhave  is a gun.  It's under  the mattress.\"  The police proceeded\n\nto  search  the  apartment.   They  found  the  pistol under  the\n\nmattress.  A bottle of inositol, a chemical used to cut or dilute\n\ncocaine,  sat on  top of the  bureau.   The bottom  drawer of the\n\ndresser was nailed shut.  The officers discovered that the drawer\n\nitself had  been removed and  only the facade  remained.   On the\n\nfloor behind the false drawer front, they found a paper bag and a\n\nmetal box.  The paper bag  held three plastic bags that contained\n\n299.22 grams of cocaine.  The metal box contained $3866 in United\n\nStates  currency and  two  Rhode Island  state lottery  receipts,\n\nwhich indicated that  Familia had  received a total  of $2085  in\n\nwinnings  on August  28, 1991.    The police  also found  a small\n\nplastic bag containing  ten rounds of  .38 caliber ammunition  in\n\nplain view on the floor in front of the bedroom closet.\n\n          After trial,  a jury  convicted Familia and  Jackson of\n\nconspiring to possess, and possession of,  cocaine with intent to\n\ndistribute  it.  The sentencing judge  held a hearing at which he\n\nconsidered objections raised by the government and Jackson to the\n\nPresentence  Investigation Report  (\"PSR\").   After  argument, he\n\ndetermined  the GSR.   The  judge assigned  a base  offense level\n\n(\"BOL\") of 24  for the quantity of drugs involved in the offense.\n\nHe arrived at the BOL by converting  the $3866 in currency seized\n\ninto 109.6  grams of cocaine based on the going price at the time\n\nof the  offense.1   To that  amount, the  judge added the  299.22\n\n                    \n\n1   Based  on  advice from  the  Drug Enforcement  Administration\n(\"DEA\"), the  probation officer who prepared  the PSR established\n$1000 as  the going  price for an  ounce of cocaine  in November,\n\n                               -3-\n\ngrams of cocaine  actually seized.  Thus, the  BOL derived from a\n\ntotal  quantity of  408.82  grams of  cocaine.   See  U.S.S.G.   \n                                                    \n\n2D1.1(c)(10) (Drug Quantity Table) &amp; comment. (n.12) (Nov. 1991).\n\nThe court  increased the BOL  by two levels  for possession of  a\n\ndangerous  firearm, as required  by U.S.S.G.    2D1.1(b)(1).  The\n\ncourt  rejected   the  two-level   decrease  for  a   minor  role\n\nrecommended by the PSR,  finding insufficient evidence to warrant\n\nsuch  a reduction.   See id.  at    3B1.2(b).   Based on  a total\n                            \n\noffense level  of 26 and  Jackson's criminal history  category of\n\nIII, the court determined that the GSR was 78 to 97 months.\n\n          Jackson   appeals  from  the   sentencing  judge's  GSR\n\ncalculation,  raising three contentions:  The  court erred by (1)\n\ndenying  her a  downward adjustment  of two  levels based  on her\n\nminor role in the offense;  (2) raising the offense level by  two\n\npoints for presence of a firearm; and (3) converting the $3866 in\n\ncurrency into  a quantity of  cocaine to  determine the BOL.   We\n\nconsider each in turn.\n\n                                II\n                                  \n\n          Mitigating  Role.    Guideline    3B1.2  allows  for  a\n                          \n\ndownward adjustment of  the offense level for  defendants who are\n\nless  culpable than other participants in the crime.  A defendant\n\nbears the  burden of  establishing that  she deserves a  downward\n\nadjustment.  United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 717 (1st  Cir.\n                                   \n\n1992),  cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1005 (1993).  Since role-in-the-\n                    \n\n                    \n\n1991.   Therefore,  $3866 converts  to  3.866 ounces  of cocaine,\nwhich is equivalent to 109.6 grams.\n\n                               -4-\n\noffense determinations  are fact-bound,  we review  such findings\n\nonly for clear error.   See, e.g., United  States v. Sostre,  967\n                                                           \n\nF.2d  728, 732 (1st  Cir. 1992); United States  v. Brum, 948 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n817, 820 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          In this  case, Jackson  was convicted of  conspiring to\n\npossess, and possession of, cocaine with intent to distribute it.\n\nFamilia testified that neither defendant was involved with drugs,\n\nand that the drugs might have belonged to his brother (he was not\n\ncertain  to  whom  they belonged).    Neither  the  jury nor  the\n\nsentencing  judge  credited Familia's  contentions,  however, and\n\nJackson offered nothing else  to meet her burden of  proving that\n\nshe acted in  a lesser  capacity.  We  therefore cannot  conclude\n\nthat the judge  clearly erred in denying the downward adjustment.\n\nSee  United States v.  Ruiz, 905  F.2d 499,  508 (1st  Cir. 1990)\n                           \n\n(\"where   there  is   more  than   one  plausible  view   of  the\n\ncircumstances,  the sentencing  court's choice  among supportable\n\nalternatives cannot be clearly erroneous\").\n\n          Weapon   Possession   Adjustment.      The   sentencing\n                                          \n\nguidelines require that the offense level be raised two points if\n\na  firearm  was  possessed  during a  drug  trafficking  offense.\n\nU.S.S.G.    2D1.1(b)(1).   \"We have  held that,  if a  weapon was\n\npresent,  the  adjustment should  be  made unless  it  is clearly\n\nimprobable  that  the weapon  and  the  offense were  connected.\"\n\nUnited  States v. McDowell, 918  F.2d 1004, 1011  (1st Cir. 1990)\n                          \n\n(citing Ruiz, 905  F.2d at  507; United States  v. Mocciola,  891\n                                                           \n\nF.2d 13, 17 (1st Cir. 1989)).\n\n                               -5-\n\n          Jackson argues  that her offense level  should not have\n\nbeen raised for presence of a weapon.  Jackson asserts that there\n\nwas no  evidence  showing that  she knew  the gun  was under  the\n\nmattress or that she had ever used the firearm.  On the contrary,\n\nFamilia testified that the gun was  his and that she knew nothing\n\nabout the weapon.   Moreover, she was not charged  for possession\n\nof a weapon and Familia was acquitted of possession during a drug\n\ntrafficking crime.  The adjustment, she argues, was unwarranted.\n\n          The  determination that  a weapon  is present  during a\n\ndrug  offense is  factual; it  will be  set aside only  for clear\n\nerror.  United States v. Corcimiglia, 967 F.2d 724, 726 (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1992);  United  States v.  Pineda, 981  F.2d  569, 572  (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n1992).    Neither  the fact  that  Jackson  was  not charged  for\n\npossession   of   the   weapon   nor   Familia's   acquittal   is\n\ndeterminative.   The  decision  not to  charge  Jackson may  have\n\nresulted from the government's belief that it could not prove her\n\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  The acquittal of Familia merely\n\nestablished that the government failed  to prove his guilt beyond\n\na reasonable  doubt.  At sentencing however,  the government need\n\nonly  prove facts by a preponderance of the evidence, Pineda, 981\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 574  (citing United States v.  Wright, 873 F.2d  437, 441\n                                             \n\n(1st  Cir. 1989)), and uncharged conduct may be attributed to the\n\ndefendant  for sentencing  purposes, U.S.S.G.    1B1.3,  comment.\n\n(backg'd.)  (\"Conduct that is not  formally charged or  is not an\n\nelement  of  the  offense  of  conviction   may  enter  into  the\n\ndetermination  of the  applicable guideline  sentencing range.\");\n\n                               -6-\n\nsee, e.g.,United States v. Garc a,954 F.2d 12, 15(1st Cir. 1992).\n                                 \n\n          The facts are not nearly as favorable to Jackson as she\n\nbelieves.  The weapon was definitely present; the police found it\n\nunder  the mattress  where  Familia said  it  was located.    The\n\nsentencing  court reasonably  inferred that  Jackson knew  of its\n\npresence:   Jackson  lived  in the  apartment  with Familia;  the\n\nfirearm was hidden under their bed, the ammunition for the pistol\n\nlay on the floor, next  to the bed, plainly within her  view; the\n\napartment  was used to traffic narcotics; and the gun was located\n\nonly a few feet from where  the cocaine and inositol were  found.\n\nGiven Familia's numerous other implausible statements,  the judge\n\nwas entitled  to disregard Familia's  exculpatory statement  that\n\nJackson knew nothing of  the weapon and that  he purchased it  to\n\ndeter car thieves.  Even  if Familia owned the weapon, under  the\n\ncircumstances  detailed above,  it  was reasonable  to find  that\n\nJackson  also possessed the weapon.  See Corcimiglia, 967 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n727.   Moreover,  \"an alternative  legal  basis for  the  weapons\n\npossession, in  and of  itself, does  not prevent  the sentencing\n\ncourt from granting the enhancement.\"  Id. (citing United  States\n                                                                 \n\nv.

E.g., Corcimiglia, 967 F.2d at 727; McDowell, 918 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat  1011.  Defendant bears  the burden of  demonstrating that the\n\n                               -7-\n\nconnection was clearly improbable.  Corcimiglia, 967 F.2d at 728.\n                                               \n\nNothing in the record disputes  the reasonable inference that the\n\ngun was connected to the  offense.  The sentencing judge did  not\n\nclearly err in imposing the two-level increase.\n\n          Conversion of  Currency.  The PSR  recommended that the\n                                 \n\n$3866  of currency found in the  metal box, which was stored next\n\nto the cocaine  in the  bedroom, be considered  proceeds of  drug\n\ntrafficking  for  sentencing purposes.    As  a  result, the  PSR\n\nconverted the  seized  currency into a quantity of  cocaine based\n\non  an approximation of the  going price of  cocaine in November,\n\n1991  ($1000).2   The sentencing  court agreed  and computed  the\n\ntotal  quantity of  cocaine relevant  to setting  the BOL  as the\n\namount  of cocaine actually seized  and the amount  that could be\n\npurchased by the seized currency.  Including this extra amount of\n\ncocaine raised the BOL by two levels.\n\n          Jackson  contests the  conversion  of  the currency  on\n\nthree grounds.  She argues first that because the $1000 price per\n\nounce  was  an  approximation,  it is  unfair  to  calculate  the\n\nquantity on  that basis.  She  next contends that the  DEA source\n\nfor  the conversion  price  was never  called  as a  witness  and\n\n\"technically there was a  denial of confrontation.\"  (Appellant's\n\nBrief  at 9).    Finally,  she  urges  that  the  district  court\n\nincorrectly  deemed  the  $3866  of  currency  proceeds  of  drug\n\ntransactions because there was evidence that the money could have\n\n                    \n\n2   A DEA  agent provided  the  price estimate  to the  probation\nofficer.  See supra note 1.\n                   \n\n                               -8-\n\ncome from at least two or three other sources.\n\n          In  sentencing  cases  involving  disputed  amounts  of\n\nillicit substances, we  have required  that reliable  information\n\nsupport,  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence,  the  quantity\n\nattributed  to the defendant.  See, e.g., United States v. Sklar,\n                                                                \n\n920  F.2d  107,  113 (1st  Cir.  1990).    Under the  Guidelines,\n\n\"[w]here there is no drug  seizure or the amount seized  does not\n\nreflect  the scale  of the  offense,  the sentencing  judge shall\n\napproximate the quantity of  the controlled substance.\"  U.S.S.G.\n\n  2D1.4 comment. (n.2).  In  making the estimate, \"the judge  may\n\nconsider,  for  example, the  price  generally  obtained for  the\n\ncontrolled  substance,  .  .  .  [and]  similar  transactions  in\n\ncontrolled  substances by the defendant  . . . .\"  Id.3   We have\n                                                      \n\nsanctioned  the use of estimates  when an exact  figure cannot be\n\ndetermined, but we demand that \"when choosing between a number of\n\nplausible estimates  of drug quantity .  . . a court  must err on\n\nthe side  of caution.\"   Sklar, 920 F.2d  at 113  (quoting United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v.

Gerante\n\nobjected  to  treating  money  found   in  his  residence  as  an\n\nequivalent quantity of contraband  for the purpose of determining\n\nrelevant conduct  under   1B1.3.   Following  the command  of the\n\nGuidelines, we  approved the practice of  estimating the quantity\n\nof cocaine that a defendant had exchanged for a sum  of money and\n\nholding the defendant accountable for that quantity, provided the\n\nmoney represents  drug transactions  that are  part  of the  same\n\ncourse  of conduct as the instant offense.   See id., 891 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n369; see also Sklar, 920 F.2d at 113 (approving same practice).  \n                   \n\n          Several  other circuits have  approved the  practice in\n\ncases  involving large  quantities  of contraband  and  currency.\n\nSee, e.g.,  United States v. Hicks, 948  F.2d 877 (4th Cir. 1991)\n                                  \n\n(involving  two  kilograms  of  cocaine and  $279,550  in  cash);\n\nDuarte,  950 F.2d at 1265  (approving principle in case involving\n      \n\nfive  kilograms and  $117,000 cash,  but remanding  because price\n\nrange estimate could have resulted in two different GSRs); United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v.

Cases involving large amounts of\n\ncurrency  more readily  support a  reasonable inference  that the\n\namount seized  does not reflect  the scale of the  offense.  When\n\ndrug traffickers possess large amounts of cash in ready proximity\n\nto  their drug supply, a  reasonable inference may  be drawn that\n\nthe money represents drug profits.\n\n          Small amounts  of currency do not present  such a clear\n\ncase.    Nonetheless,  the  obligation of  the  sentencing  judge\n\nremains  the  same.   The judge  must  determine the  quantity of\n\ncocaine  involved, taking into account  all relevant conduct.  If\n\nthe judge supportably finds that  the quantity of cocaine  seized\n\ndoes  not reflect \"the scale of the offense,\" and concludes, by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, that certain  amounts of money are\n\ndrug proceeds from  the same  course of conduct,  then the  judge\n\nmust estimate  the amount of  drugs that the  defendant exchanged\n\nfor the currency seized.\n\n          We   turn  now   to  Jackson's  argument   against  the\n\nconversion  of  the $3866  to 109.6  grams  of cocaine.   Neither\n\nJackson's written objections to  the PSR nor her argument  at the\n\nsentencing hearing  challenged the $1000 conversion  price or the\n\nfailure of the  DEA agent  who provided the  conversion price  to\n\ntestify  at the sentencing hearing.  Having failed to raise these\n\ncontentions before the  sentencing court, they may not  be raised\n\n                               -11-\n\nfor the first time on appeal.  See, e.g., United States v. Dietz,\n                                                                \n\n950 F.2d 50,  56 (1st  Cir. 1991); United  States v.

Ct. 2039 (1991).\n      \n\n          We  are unpersuaded  by Jackson's  third contention  as\n\nwell.  She  argues that the  currency could have come  from other\n\nsources and, as  a consequence,  the evidence did  not support  a\n\nfinding that these funds were proceeds of drug transactions which\n\nwere part of the same course of conduct.  In many cases involving\n\nsmall amounts of currency it will be difficult for the government\n\nto  prove by a  preponderance of the  evidence that  the money is\n\ntied to drug trafficking.  This, however, is not such a case.\n\n          Jackson claims  that $2085 of the  seized currency were\n\nwinnings  from the Rhode  Island Lottery and  offered the lottery\n\nreceipts from August 28,  1991 found in the metal  box containing\n\nthe  currency  to  prove  that  contention.    The  balance,  she\n\ncontends, was given to Familia to purchase his van and ship it to\n\nhis  sister in  Puerto Rico.   These  appear to  be superficially\n\nappealing explanations.  They prove unavailing, however.  \n\n          The sentencing judge rejected her story because Familia\n\nnever   claimed   that  monies   were   lottery   winnings,  thus\n\ncontradicting   Jackson's  assertions.     Where   their  stories\n\noverlapped,  the judge did not believe Familia or his sister, who\n\n                               -12-\n\ntestified that she sent him $3600 for his car.  At the sentencing\n\nhearing,  Familia's  sister  was  unable to  provide  any  detail\n\nconcerning  the purchase of  the car.  She  could not recall what\n\ndenominations of currency she  sent to her brother.   She did not\n\nknow the  make of the vehicle, its age, its mileage, how much her\n\nbrother charged for the van, or the cost of shipping it to Puerto\n\nRico.    The judge  therefore  rejected  the various  alternative\n\nsources of the currency  and determined that the funds  were drug\n\nproceeds.\n\n          We cannot say  that the sentencing judge's  conclusions\n\nwere clearly erroneous.  It is possible that Familia's sister was\n\nnot knowledgeable regarding motor vehicles and that she entrusted\n\nthe details of the transaction to her brother, satisfied that her\n\nkin  would  treat  her  honestly.    The  judge  present  at  the\n\nsentencing  hearing is  in  the best  position  to determine  the\n\ncredibility  of  the witnesses  and the  source of  the currency,\n\nhowever.   See  Wainwright  v. Witt,  469  U.S. 412,  428  (1985)\n                                   \n\n(credibility determinations are peculiarly within a trial judge's\n\nprovince).   Here,  the court  discredited a  remotely plausible,\n\nlawful  explanation  for the  monies and  found  them to  be drug\n\nprofits.\n\n          Finding no clear error, we affirm.\n                                           \n\n                               -13-\n",

See 21 U.S.C. Secs. 846, 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(C).  Familia, whose appeal is not part of this case, was also charged with using a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c).  Jackson was not charged with this third count.  After trial, a jury convicted both defendants on Counts I and II, but acquitted Familia of the firearm charge.  Jackson does not appeal her conviction, but contests the district court's calculation of her guideline sentencing range (\"GSR\") on several grounds.  For the reasons that follow, we affirm.I</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 11, 1991, police officers from Providence, Rhode Island went to execute a search warrant at the second floor apartment of 142 Bowdoin Street, Providence.  At approximately 7:00 p.m., Familia departed from the apartment and drove away in a Dodge minivan.  The officers stopped the vehicle and returned with Familia to his apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They entered the kitchen through the rear door using Familia's keys.  The kitchen leads directly to the master bedroom, which contained a bed, a crib, an upright dresser, a bureau and a television table.  Jackson was on the bed with the couple's child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon entering the apartment, Familia declared:  \"All I have is a gun.  It's under the mattress.\"   The police proceeded to search the apartment.  They found the pistol under the mattress.  A bottle of inositol, a chemical used to cut or dilute cocaine, sat on top of the bureau.  The bottom drawer of the dresser was nailed shut.  The officers discovered that the drawer itself had been removed and only the facade remained.  On the floor behind the false drawer front, they found a paper bag and a metal box.  The paper bag held three plastic bags that contained 299.22 grams of cocaine.  The metal box contained $3866 in United States currency and two Rhode Island state lottery receipts, which indicated that Familia had received a total of $2085 in winnings on August 28, 1991.  The police also found a small plastic bag containing ten rounds of .38 caliber ammunition in plain view on the floor in front of the bedroom closet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After trial, a jury convicted Familia and Jackson of conspiring to possess, and possession of, cocaine with intent to distribute it.  The sentencing judge held a hearing at which he considered objections raised by the government and Jackson to the Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\").  After argument, he determined the GSR.  The judge assigned a base offense level (\"BOL\") of 24 for the quantity of drugs involved in the offense.  He arrived at the BOL by converting the $3866 in currency seized into 109.6 grams of cocaine based on the going price at the time of the offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  To that amount, the judge added the 299.22 grams of cocaine actually seized.  Thus, the BOL derived from a total quantity of 408.82 grams of cocaine.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(c)(10) (Drug Quantity Table) &amp; comment.  (n. 12) (Nov. 1991).  The court increased the BOL by two levels for possession of a dangerous firearm, as required by U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1).  The court rejected the two-level decrease for a minor role recommended by the PSR, finding insufficient evidence to warrant such a reduction.  See id. at Sec. 3B1.2(b).  Based on a total offense level of 26 and Jackson's criminal history category of III, the court determined that the GSR was 78 to 97 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jackson appeals from the sentencing judge's GSR calculation, raising three contentions:  The court erred by (1) denying her a downward adjustment of two levels based on her minor role in the offense;  (2) raising the offense level by two points for presence of a firearm;  and (3) converting the $3866 in currency into a quantity of cocaine to determine the BOL.  We consider each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mitigating Role.   Guideline Sec. 3B1.2 allows for a downward adjustment of the offense level for defendants who are less culpable than other participants in the crime.  A defendant bears the burden of establishing that she deserves a downward adjustment.  United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 717 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1005, 122 L.Ed.2d 154 (1993).  Since role-in-the-offense determinations are fact-bound, we review such findings only for clear error.  See, e.g., United States v. Sostre, 967 F.2d 728, 732 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Brum, 948 F.2d 817, 820 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Jackson was convicted of conspiring to possess, and possession of, cocaine with intent to distribute it.  Familia testified that neither defendant was involved with drugs, and that the drugs might have belonged to his brother (he was not certain to whom they belonged).  Neither the jury nor the sentencing judge credited Familia's contentions, however, and Jackson offered nothing else to meet her burden of proving that she acted in a lesser capacity.  We therefore cannot conclude that the judge clearly erred in denying the downward adjustment.  See United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir.1990) (\"where there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing court's choice among supportable alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weapon Possession Adjustment.   The sentencing guidelines require that the offense level be raised two points if a firearm was possessed during a drug trafficking offense.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1).  \"We have held that, if a weapon was present, the adjustment should be made unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon and the offense were connected.\"  United States v. McDowell, 918 F.2d 1004, 1011 (1st Cir.1990) (citing Ruiz, 905 F.2d at 507;  United States v. Mocciola, 891 F.2d 13, 17 (1st Cir.1989)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jackson argues that her offense level should not have been raised for presence of a weapon.  Jackson asserts that there was no evidence showing that she knew the gun was under the mattress or that she had ever used the firearm.  On the contrary, Familia testified that the gun was his and that she knew nothing about the weapon.  Moreover, she was not charged for possession of a weapon and Familia was acquitted of possession during a drug trafficking crime.  The adjustment, she argues, was unwarranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The determination that a weapon is present during a drug offense is factual;  it will be set aside only for clear error.  United States v. Corcimiglia, 967 F.2d 724, 726 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Pineda, 981 F.2d 569, 572 (1st Cir.1992).  Neither the fact that Jackson was not charged for possession of the weapon nor Familia's acquittal is determinative.  The decision not to charge Jackson may have resulted from the government's belief that it could not prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  The acquittal of Familia merely established that the government failed to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  At sentencing however, the government need only prove facts by a preponderance of the evidence, Pineda, 981 F.2d at 574 (citing United States v. Wright, 873 F.2d 437, 441 (1st Cir.1989)), and uncharged conduct may be attributed to the defendant for sentencing purposes, U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3, comment.  (backg'd.)  (\"Conduct that is not formally charged or is not an element of the offense of conviction may enter into the determination of the applicable guideline sentencing range.\");   see, e.g., United States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12, 15 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are not nearly as favorable to Jackson as she believes.  The weapon was definitely present;  the police found it under the mattress where Familia said it was located.  The sentencing court reasonably inferred that Jackson knew of its presence:  Jackson lived in the apartment with Familia;  the firearm was hidden under their bed, the ammunition for the pistol lay on the floor, next to the bed, plainly within her view;  the apartment was used to traffic narcotics;  and the gun was located only a few feet from where the cocaine and inositol were found.  Given Familia's numerous other implausible statements, the judge was entitled to disregard Familia's exculpatory statement that Jackson knew nothing of the weapon and that he purchased it to deter car thieves.  Even if Familia owned the weapon, under the circumstances detailed above, it was reasonable to find that Jackson also possessed the weapon.  See Corcimiglia, 967 F.2d at 727.   Moreover, \"an alternative legal basis for the weapons possession, in and of itself, does not prevent the sentencing court from granting the enhancement.\"  Id. (citing United States v. Almonte, 952 F.2d 20, 25 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1776, 118 L.Ed.2d 434 (1992);  Ruiz, 905 F.2d at 508).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, when it has been shown that the firearm was present, the relevant inquiry is whether it is \"clearly improbable\" that the weapon could have been used during the offense.  E.g., Corcimiglia, 967 F.2d at 727;  McDowell, 918 F.2d at 1011.   Defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the connection was clearly improbable.  Corcimiglia, 67 F.2d at 728.   Nothing in the record disputes the reasonable inference that the gun was connected to the offense.  The sentencing judge did not clearly err in imposing the two-level increase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversion of Currency.   The PSR recommended that the $3866 of currency found in the metal box, which was stored next to the cocaine in the bedroom, be considered proceeds of drug trafficking for sentencing purposes.  As a result, the PSR converted the seized currency into a quantity of cocaine based on an approximation of the going price of cocaine in November, 1991 ($1000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The sentencing court agreed and computed the total quantity of cocaine relevant to setting the BOL as the amount of cocaine actually seized and the amount that could be purchased by the seized currency.  Including this extra amount of cocaine raised the BOL by two levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jackson contests the conversion of the currency on three grounds.  She argues first that because the $1000 price per ounce was an approximation, it is unfair to calculate the quantity on that basis.  She next contends that the DEA source for the conversion price was never called as a witness and \"technically there was a denial of confrontation.\"  (Appellant's Brief at 9).  Finally, she urges that the district court incorrectly deemed the $3866 of currency proceeds of drug transactions because there was evidence that the money could have come from at least two or three other sources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sentencing cases involving disputed amounts of illicit substances, we have required that reliable information support, by a preponderance of the evidence, the quantity attributed to the defendant.  See, e.g., United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 113 (1st Cir.1990).  Under the Guidelines, \"[w]here there is no drug seizure or the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the sentencing judge shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.4 comment.  (n. 2).  In making the estimate, \"the judge may consider, for example, the price generally obtained for the controlled substance, ... [and] similar transactions in controlled substances by the defendant....\"  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We have sanctioned the use of estimates when an exact figure cannot be determined, but we demand that \"when choosing between a number of plausible estimates of drug quantity ... a court must err on the side of caution.\"  Sklar, 920 F.2d at 113 (quoting United States v. Walton, 908 F.2d 1289, 1301 (6th Cir.)  (internal quotation omitted), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 906, 111 S.Ct. 273, 112 L.Ed.2d 229 (1990)).  Ultimately, however, the determination that an amount of money represents proceeds from drug transactions that are part of the same course of conduct as the charged offense, and therefore represents relevant conduct attributable to the defendant, is predominantly factual and reviewable only for clear error.  United States v. Gerante, 891 F.2d 364, 368 (1st Cir.1989);  Sklar, 920 F.2d at 114;  see also United States v. Duarte, 950 F.2d 1255, 1265 (7th Cir.1991) (ascertaining quantity of drugs, which involves conversion of currency into equivalent drug quantity, is factual determination subject to clearly erroneous standard), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 174, 121 L.Ed.2d 120 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Gerante, the defendant was arrested with 4.98 kilograms of cocaine and $68,000 in cash.  Gerante objected to treating money found in his residence as an equivalent quantity of contraband for the purpose of determining relevant conduct under Sec. 1B1.3.  Following the command of the Guidelines, we approved the practice of estimating the quantity of cocaine that a defendant had exchanged for a sum of money and holding the defendant accountable for that quantity, provided the money represents drug transactions that are part of the same course of conduct as the instant offense.  See id., 891 F.2d at 369;  see also Sklar, 920 F.2d at 113 (approving same practice).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several other circuits have approved the practice in cases involving large quantities of contraband and currency.  See, e.g., United States v. Hicks, 948 F.2d 877 (4th Cir.1991) (involving two kilograms of cocaine and $279,550 in cash);  Duarte, 950 F.2d at 1265 (approving principle in case involving five kilograms and $117,000 cash, but remanding because price range estimate could have resulted in two different GSRs);  United States v. Stephenson, 924 F.2d 753 (8th Cir.)  (233 grams of cocaine and $112,867 cash);  but cf. United States v. Gonzalez-Sanchez, 953 F.2d 1184, 1186-87 (9th Cir.1992) (approving principle of converting $1541 into quantity of heroin, but rejecting conversion where no evidence supported connection of currency to drug transactions).  Cases involving large amounts of currency more readily support a reasonable inference that the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense.  When drug traffickers possess large amounts of cash in ready proximity to their drug supply, a reasonable inference may be drawn that the money represents drug profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Small amounts of currency do not present such a clear case.  Nonetheless, the obligation of the sentencing judge remains the same.  The judge must determine the quantity of cocaine involved, taking into account all relevant conduct.  If the judge supportably finds that the quantity of cocaine seized does not reflect \"the scale of the offense,\" and concludes, by a preponderance of the evidence, that certain amounts of money are drug proceeds from the same course of conduct, then the judge must estimate the amount of drugs that the defendant exchanged for the currency seized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to Jackson's argument against the conversion of the $3866 to 109.6 grams of cocaine.  Neither Jackson's written objections to the PSR nor her argument at the sentencing hearing challenged the $1000 conversion price or the failure of the DEA agent who provided the conversion price to testify at the sentencing hearing.  Having failed to raise these contentions before the sentencing court, they may not be raised for the first time on appeal.  See, e.g., United States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 56 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v. Uricoechea-Casallas, 946 F.2d 162, 166 (1st Cir.1991), see also United States v. Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d 33, 36 (1st Cir.1990) (\"A sentencing hearing need not meet all the procedural safeguards and strict evidentiary limitations of a criminal trial.\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2039, 114 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are unpersuaded by Jackson's third contention as well.  She argues that the currency could have come from other sources and, as a consequence, the evidence did not support a finding that these funds were proceeds of drug transactions which were part of the same course of conduct.  In many cases involving small amounts of currency it will be difficult for the government to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the money is tied to drug trafficking.  This, however, is not such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jackson claims that $2085 of the seized currency were winnings from the Rhode Island Lottery and offered the lottery receipts from August 28, 1991 found in the metal box containing the currency to prove that contention.  The balance, she contends, was given to Familia to purchase his van and ship it to his sister in Puerto Rico.  These appear to be superficially appealing explanations.  They prove unavailing, however.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing judge rejected her story because Familia never claimed that monies were lottery winnings, thus contradicting Jackson's assertions.  Where their stories overlapped, the judge did not believe Familia or his sister, who testified that she sent him $3600 for his car.  At the sentencing hearing, Familia's sister was unable to provide any detail concerning the purchase of the car.  She could not recall what denominations of currency she sent to her brother.  She did not know the make of the vehicle, its age, its mileage, how much her brother charged for the van, or the cost of shipping it to Puerto Rico.  The judge therefore rejected the various alternative sources of the currency and determined that the funds were drug proceeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot say that the sentencing judge's conclusions were clearly erroneous.  It is possible that Familia's sister was not knowledgeable regarding motor vehicles and that she entrusted the details of the transaction to her brother, satisfied that her kin would treat her honestly.  The judge present at the sentencing hearing is in the best position to determine the credibility of the witnesses and the source of the currency, however.  See Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 428, 105 S.Ct. 844, 854, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985) (credibility determinations are peculiarly within a trial judge's province).  Here, the court discredited a remotely plausible, lawful explanation for the monies and found them to be drug profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding no clear error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Second Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Based on advice from the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\"), the probation officer who prepared the PSR established $1000 as the going price for an ounce of cocaine in November, 1991.

See 21 U.S.C. Secs. 846, 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(C).  Familia, whose appeal is not part of this case, was also charged with using a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c).  Jackson was not charged with this third count.  After trial, a jury convicted both defendants on Counts I and II, but acquitted Familia of the firearm charge.  Jackson does not appeal her conviction, but contests the district court's calculation of her guideline sentencing range (\"GSR\") on several grounds.  For the reasons that follow, we affirm.I</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 11, 1991, police officers from Providence, Rhode Island went to execute a search warrant at the second floor apartment of 142 Bowdoin Street, Providence.  At approximately 7:00 p.m., Familia departed from the apartment and drove away in a Dodge minivan.  The officers stopped the vehicle and returned with Familia to his apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They entered the kitchen through the rear door using Familia's keys.  The kitchen leads directly to the master bedroom, which contained a bed, a crib, an upright dresser, a bureau and a television table.  Jackson was on the bed with the couple's child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon entering the apartment, Familia declared:  \"All I have is a gun.  It's under the mattress.\"   The police proceeded to search the apartment.  They found the pistol under the mattress.  A bottle of inositol, a chemical used to cut or dilute cocaine, sat on top of the bureau.  The bottom drawer of the dresser was nailed shut.  The officers discovered that the drawer itself had been removed and only the facade remained.  On the floor behind the false drawer front, they found a paper bag and a metal box.  The paper bag held three plastic bags that contained 299.22 grams of cocaine.  The metal box contained $3866 in United States currency and two Rhode Island state lottery receipts, which indicated that Familia had received a total of $2085 in winnings on August 28, 1991.  The police also found a small plastic bag containing ten rounds of .38 caliber ammunition in plain view on the floor in front of the bedroom closet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After trial, a jury convicted Familia and Jackson of conspiring to possess, and possession of, cocaine with intent to distribute it.  The sentencing judge held a hearing at which he considered objections raised by the government and Jackson to the Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\").  After argument, he determined the GSR.  The judge assigned a base offense level (\"BOL\") of 24 for the quantity of drugs involved in the offense.  He arrived at the BOL by converting the $3866 in currency seized into 109.6 grams of cocaine based on the going price at the time of the offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  To that amount, the judge added the 299.22 grams of cocaine actually seized.  Thus, the BOL derived from a total quantity of 408.82 grams of cocaine.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(c)(10) (Drug Quantity Table) &amp; comment.  (n. 12) (Nov. 1991).  The court increased the BOL by two levels for possession of a dangerous firearm, as required by U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1).  The court rejected the two-level decrease for a minor role recommended by the PSR, finding insufficient evidence to warrant such a reduction.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at Sec. </span>3B1.2(b).  Based on a total offense level of 26 and Jackson's criminal history category of III, the court determined that the GSR was 78 to 97 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jackson appeals from the sentencing judge's GSR calculation, raising three contentions:  The court erred by (1) denying her a downward adjustment of two levels based on her minor role in the offense;  (2) raising the offense level by two points for presence of a firearm;  and (3) converting the $3866 in currency into a quantity of cocaine to determine the BOL.

Familia testified that neither defendant was involved with drugs, and that the drugs might have belonged to his brother (he was not certain to whom they belonged).  Neither the jury nor the sentencing judge credited Familia's contentions, however, and Jackson offered nothing else to meet her burden of proving that she acted in a lesser capacity.

Neither the fact that Jackson was not charged for possession of the weapon nor Familia's acquittal is determinative.  The decision not to charge Jackson may have resulted from the government's belief that it could not prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

The sentencing court reasonably inferred that Jackson knew of its presence:  Jackson lived in the apartment with Familia;  the firearm was hidden under their bed, the ammunition for the pistol lay on the floor, next to the bed, plainly within her view;  the apartment was used to traffic narcotics;  and the gun was located only a few feet from where the cocaine and inositol were found.  Given Familia's numerous other implausible statements, the judge was entitled to disregard Familia's exculpatory statement that Jackson knew nothing of the weapon and that he purchased it to deter car thieves.

Gerante, the defendant was arrested with 4.98 kilograms of cocaine and $68,000 in cash.  Gerante objected to treating money found in his residence as an equivalent quantity of contraband for the purpose of determining relevant conduct under Sec. 1B1.3.  Following the command of the Guidelines, we approved the practice of estimating the quantity of cocaine that a defendant had exchanged for a sum of money and holding the defendant accountable for that quantity, provided the money represents drug transactions that are part of the same course of conduct as the instant offense.

(233 grams of cocaine and $112,867 cash);  but cf. United States v. Gonzalez-Sanchez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575892\"><a href=\"/opinion/575892/united-states-v-sabino-gonzalez-sanchez-aka-francisco-javier/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span>, 1186-87 (9th Cir.1992) (approving principle of converting $1541 into quantity of heroin, but rejecting conversion where no evidence supported connection of currency to drug transactions).  Cases involving large amounts of currency more readily support a reasonable inference that the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense.  When drug traffickers possess large amounts of cash in ready proximity to their drug supply, a reasonable inference may be drawn that the money represents drug profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Small amounts of currency do not present such a clear case.  Nonetheless, the obligation of the sentencing judge remains the same.  The judge must determine the quantity of cocaine involved, taking into account all relevant conduct.  If the judge supportably finds that the quantity of cocaine seized does not reflect \"the scale of the offense,\" and concludes, by a preponderance of the evidence, that certain amounts of money are drug proceeds from the same course of conduct, then the judge must estimate the amount of drugs that the defendant exchanged for the currency seized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to Jackson's argument against the conversion of the $3866 to 109.6 grams of cocaine.  Neither Jackson's written objections to the PSR nor her argument at the sentencing hearing challenged the $1000 conversion price or the failure of the DEA agent who provided the conversion price to testify at the sentencing hearing.  Having failed to raise these contentions before the sentencing court, they may not be raised for the first time on appeal.  See, e.g., United States v. Dietz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572657\"><a href=\"/opinion/572657/united-states-v-william-a-dietz/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 56 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v.

Zuleta-Alvarez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553331\"><a href=\"/opinion/553331/united-states-v-john-jairo-zuleta-alvarez-aka-john-zuleta-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir.1990) (\"A sentencing hearing need not meet all the procedural safeguards and strict evidentiary limitations of a criminal trial.\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

She argues that the currency could have come from other sources and, as a consequence, the evidence did not support a finding that these funds were proceeds of drug transactions which were part of the same course of conduct.  In many cases involving small amounts of currency it will be difficult for the government to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the money is tied to drug trafficking.  This, however, is not such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jackson claims that $2085 of the seized currency were winnings from the Rhode Island Lottery and offered the lottery receipts from August 28, 1991 found in the metal box containing the currency to prove that contention.  The balance, she contends, was given to Familia to purchase his van and ship it to his sister in Puerto Rico.  These appear to be superficially appealing explanations.  They prove unavailing, however.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing judge rejected her story because Familia never claimed that monies were lottery winnings, thus contradicting Jackson's assertions.  Where their stories overlapped, the judge did not believe Familia or his sister, who testified that she sent him $3600 for his car.  At the sentencing hearing, Familia's sister was unable to provide any detail concerning the purchase of the car.  She could not recall what denominations of currency she sent to her brother.  She did not know the make of the vehicle, its age, its mileage, how much her brother charged for the van, or the cost of shipping it to Puerto Rico.  The judge therefore rejected the various alternative sources of the currency and determined that the funds were drug proceeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot say that the sentencing judge's conclusions were clearly erroneous.  It is possible that Familia's sister was not knowledgeable regarding motor vehicles and that she entrusted the details of the transaction to her brother, satisfied that her kin would treat her honestly.  The judge present at the sentencing hearing is in the best position to determine the credibility of the witnesses and the source of the currency, however.  See Wainwright v. Witt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111303\"><a href=\"/opinion/111303/wainwright-v-witt/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span>, 428, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111303\"><a href=\"/opinion/111303/wainwright-v-witt/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
