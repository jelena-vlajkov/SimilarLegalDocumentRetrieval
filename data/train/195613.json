In December  1992 a grand  jury\n                          \n\nindicted  Gary Garafano on one count of extortion under color\n\nof official right under the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C.   1951.  The\n\ngist  of the  charge was  that from  spring 1989  to December\n\n1990,  Garafano, then  an official  in the  Providence, Rhode\n\nIsland,  Department of  Public Works,  had extorted  payments\n\nfrom  a road  paving  firm doing  work  for the  city,  Forte\n\nBrothers Construction Corporation (\"Forte Brothers\").  \n\n     At  a first trial  in June 1993 the  jury deadlocked.  A\n\nsecond  trial was  conducted  in the  fall.   At  trial,  the\n\ngovernment offered testimony  of James Forte,  vice president\n\nof Forte Brothers,  that during  1988 and 1989  the firm  was\n\nengaged in road repair work for the city.  In  or about March\n\n1989,  said Forte,  he met  with Garafano  and agreed  to the\n\nlatter's demand for $8,000, without which Garafano threatened\n\nto cease authorizing  work to be performed by Forte Brothers.\n\nForte  also testified that he gave the money to Steven Tocco,\n\nthe firm's supervisor for the road repair work, to deliver to\n\nGarafano.\n\n     Tocco testified that he delivered the money to Garafano.\n\n Tocco  also testified  that in  response to  further demands\n\nfrom  Garafano,  Tocco  made  somewhere  between  12  and  20\n\nadditional  payments  to  Garafano  between  April  1989  and\n\nDecember 1990, and that  the total amount of the  payments to\n\nGarafano  was around $100,000.   Much of the  money came from\n\n                             -2-\n\ninflated billings by Forte Brothers on individual road repair\n\nand  other projects for  the city.   According to prosecution\n\ntestimony, Garafano authorized various of these projects  and\n\nexpedited payments.\n\n     Garafano  himself  testified  and  denied  demanding  or\n\nreceiving  any  money  from   Forte  Brothers.    Various  of\n\nGarafano's  subsidiary  statements were  contradicted  by the\n\ndirector of  his  city department  but  the director  had  no\n\ndirect knowledge of whether Garafano had received bribes.  On\n\nOctober  4, 1993, the jury in the second trial found Garafano\n\nguilty.   The  verdict was  a general  verdict on  the single\n\ncount charged  and provided  no indication of  which episodes\n\nthe jury found to have occurred.\n\n     On December 14, 1993, the  trial judge held a sentencing\n\nhearing.   At the hearing  defense counsel took  the position\n\nthat only the  first payment of $8,000 in March 1989 had been\n\nadequately supported  by evidence and  that Tocco's testimony\n\nas to further payments  was not credible.  It  was apparently\n\nthe  defense position  that  after the  first incident  Tocco\n\nhimself  had been stealing from the firm and claiming falsely\n\nthat the payments had been made to Garafano.  This contention\n\nwas pertinent to sentencing in several respects.\n\n     The presentence  report  had proposed  that Garafano  be\n\nsentenced under  the November 1993 version  of the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines which  was in  effect at  the time of  sentencing.\n\n                             -3-\n\nThe report recommended  that the court  fix the base  offense\n\nlevel at  10, as provided by U.S.S.G.   2C1.1(a), and that it\n\nadd two levels  as a specific offense  adjustment because the\n\noffense involved  more than  one  bribe or  extortion. Id.   \n                                                          \n\n2C1.1(b)(1).   In addition, the report  recommended a further\n\nsix-level  adjustment  based on  the  amount  of the  payment\n\nreceived by  Garafano; the guidelines provide  a table fixing\n\nsuch  an adjustment at six levels where the amount is greater\n\nthan  $70,000.  Id.      2C1.1(b)(2)(A),  2F1.1(b)(1)(G).   A\n                   \n\npayment of $8,000 would have added only two levels.  Id.\n                                                        \n\n     Prior to November 1989,  the guidelines did not included\n\nthe  two-point adjustment  for multiple  bribes.   Garafano's\n\ncounsel  objected  that   without  the  additional   payments\n\nallegedly made through Tocco,  the extortionate conduct would\n\nhave  ceased prior  to  the effectiveness  of that  guideline\n\namendment.   Counsel  argued that  if the  conduct  did cease\n\nbefore the  amendment, then  ex post facto  concerns required\n                                          \n\nthat the two points  not be included.  Our  decisions confirm\n\nthat where a guideline amendment increases the sentence after\n\nthe  offense, the  guidelines in  effect at  the time  of the\n\noffense  should  be  used.     See  e.g.,  United  States  v.\n                                                         \n\nRodriguez, 26 F.3d 4, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1994).\n         \n\n     More  important, if Tocco's  testimony were disregarded,\n\nthen  the total  amount  gained by  the extortionate  conduct\n\nwould be only $8,000.  This would eliminate not only the two-\n\n                             -4-\n\npoint adjustment for multiple bribes (since there would be no\n\nsecond   bribe  proved)  but   also  the  proposed  six-point\n\nadjustment based on  \"the loss  or gain table\".   Of  course,\n\nForte's testimony  alone, not  challenged  at the  sentencing\n\nhearing, established  that Garafano had solicited  a bribe in\n\nthe  amount of  $8,000,  whether or  not Tocco  delivered the\n\nmoney;  but  a single  $8,000  bribe would  have  reduced the\n\nguideline range.\n\n     At the  sentencing  hearing defense  counsel  asked  the\n\ncourt  to  find  that  the  1989 version  of  the  guidelines\n\napplied, asserting that  the jury may have based  its verdict\n\nonly on  the first $8,000  bribe, which counsel  described as\n\n\"the only corroborated event\"  that the government had proved\n\nto  the jury.   The  court replied,  \"how can  you ask  me to\n\ndissect what a jury has done?\"  Counsel responded that \"[t]he\n\nguidelines allow you exactly that power . . . .\"   Pressed as\n\nto  why the  court should  disbelieve Tocco,  defense counsel\n\noffered an  example of an asserted  contradiction between the\n\ntestimony of Tocco and other government witnesses.\n\n     The prosecutor  replied that Tocco's testimony  had been\n\ncorroborated, and  then added: \"I  don't think the  Court has\n\nthe discretion to piecemeal the jury's verdict in this case.\"\n\nThe  court replied:  \"I  quite agree  with  you,\" adding  (to\n\ndefense counsel)  that \"the reasons  [the prosecutor]  stated\n\nare ample  in and of themselves.\"   The court went  on to say\n\n                             -5-\n\nthat it agreed that \"the facts of the case  reflect\" that the\n\noffense  occurred between  April 1989  and December  1990 and\n\nshowed   the  receipt   of  between   12  and   20  payments.\n\nAccordingly the court rejected the ex post facto claim.\n                                                \n\n     Defense counsel  then went on  to argue at  even greater\n\nlength  that Tocco  should not  be believed.   This  time the\n\nargument was to support counsel's claim that, in applying the\n\nloss or gain table, the court should treat as proved only the\n\nfirst $8,000.  The court listened courteously to the argument\n\nand  then rejected  it,  saying that  \"there was  substantial\n\nevidence  . .  .  [that]  could  convince  a  jury  beyond  a\n\nreasonable doubt.\"   Defense counsel then said  that the jury\n\ncould have convicted solely on the basis of the $8,000 bribe.\n\nThe  court replied:  \"I'm not  going to  dissect this  jury's\n\nverdict.\"\n\n     After  other largely  unrelated  discussion,  the  court\n\nheard final statements from defense counsel and Garafano.  It\n\nthen summed up:\n\n        We have a base offense level of 10 in this case,\n     and since there was more than one bribe, two points\n     have  to be added.   And since  the amount involved\n     approximately $100,000.00, that's an additional six\n     points, which  gives a total adjusted  level of 18.\n     He has  a criminal  history category of  one, which\n     means the sentencing range is from 27 to 33 months.\n\nConcluding that  Garafano had been motivated  by \"sheer greed\n\nand  nothing else,\" the court imposed a sentence of 31 months\n\nimprisonment  and  a  $6,000  fine, together  with  an  order\n\n                             -6-\n\nrequiring  Garafano to  make restitution  of $100,000  to the\n\ncity.  This appeal followed.\n\n     The only issue on  appeal is the defense claim  that the\n\ndistrict court erred because it allegedly refused to make  an\n\nindependent assessment  of the  Tocco testimony and  make its\n\nown finding  as to  whether bribes of  approximately $100,000\n\nhad been  paid during  a period  extending to December  1990.\n\nThe government agrees  that an independent determination  was\n\nrequired  but  says  that the  district  court  made  such an\n\nassessment.  We agree  with the government that  the district\n\ncourt  probably did  make  an independent  assessment but  to\n\nremove the shadow of uncertainty, we have decided to remand.\n\n     The uncertainty  is apparent from our  recitation of the\n\nfacts.   Normally the trial court makes its own assessment of\n\nthe  facts  that  pertain  to sentencing,  drawing  on  trial\n\nevidence, the presentence report, any evidence offered at the\n\nhearing, and other appropriate sources.  See United States v.\n                                                          \n\nTavano, 12 F.3d 301, 306-07 (1st Cir. 1993).  Indeed, we have\n      \n\nheld  that a judge may  attribute conduct to  a defendant for\n\n\"relevant conduct\" purposes even where a jury has declined to\n\nconvict on counts pertaining to  such conduct.  United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Carrozza, 4 F.3d 70, 80 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114\n                                                        \n\nS.Ct. 1644  (1994); United States  v. Mocciola, 891  F.2d 13,\n                                              \n\n16-17 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n                             -7-\n\n     Whether  the   trial  court  could  ever   be  bound  at\n\nsentencing  by the jury's  determination against  a defendant\n\n(e.g., through  collateral estoppel) is  an interesting issue\n     \n\nbut is  irrelevant here: the government agrees  that the jury\n\ncould  in  theory  have  convicted  solely  on  the  evidence\n\npertaining to the first  $8,000 bribe solicitation; and since\n\nthe jury delivered a general verdict there is no way to  tell\n\nwhat it actually found as  to the number of bribes.   In sum,\n\neven if a jury verdict against the defendant  on a fact issue\n                              \n\ncould ever constrain the sentencing judge, but cf. Tavano, 12\n                                                         \n\nF.3d at 305,  307, this  jury verdict could  not resolve  the\n\namount and timing issues faced at sentencing.\n\n     We have  read the sentencing transcript in  full and are\n\ninclined to  think that the  trial judge, an  experienced and\n\nrespected jurist,  fully understood that he  could and should\n\ndecide  himself when the offense ended and how much was paid.\n\nFurther, his statement quoted above  (\"the facts of the  case\n\nreflect  . .  .\") is  reasonably clear  evidence that  he did\n\nresolve  those issues  against Garafano  and was  not relying\n\nupon  the jury verdict or  any misinterpretation of  it.  Nor\n\ndoes  Garafano argue on appeal that the evidence at trial was\n\ninsufficient  to  support  findings  at sentencing  that  the\n\nbribes continued to December 1990 and equaled about $100,000.\n\n     If this  were all, we  would affirm  without a  moment's\n\nhesitation.  But we agree with Garafano that the record is at\n\n                             -8-\n\nleast blurred by  the agreement  of the trial  judge and  the\n\nprosecutor  that the  jury  verdict could  not be  dissected.\n\nQuite likely  both meant only  that peering into  the verdict\n\nwas  infeasible and  served  no purpose;  but abstractly  the\n\nprosecutor's words  could be  taken as  an argument  that the\n\njury  had resolved  the  issue of  timing and  amount against\n\nGarafano and that this decision was binding.  \n\n     The prosecutor's statement--\"I don't think the Court has\n\nthe discretion to piecemeal the jury's verdict in this case\"-\n\n- happens to  sound like  a refutation  of defense  counsel's\n                   \n\nearlier  argument to the  court that \"[y]ou  [the court] have\n\nthe ability,  the discretion in sentencing\"  to determine the\n\namount  and  timing  of  the  loss.    As  government counsel\n\nproperly says  on appeal,  the prosecutor's statement  was an\n\n\"unfortunate\"  choice  of words.    The  district judge  then\n\nfollowed the prosecutor's statement by saying, \"I quite agree\n\nwith you\"  and telling defense counsel  that the prosecutor's\n\nreasons  were  \"ample\"   basis  for  rejecting   the  defense\n\nposition.\n\n     In  saying  that these  colloquies  leave  a measure  of\n\nuncertainty,  we do  not  intend the  slightest criticism  of\n\neither  the court  or  counsel.    Court colloquies  are  not\n\nscripted   events  like  television   commercials  or  public\n\nspeeches.  Lawyers are usually trying to advance  and explain\n\nconflicting positions, and the judge is seeking to resolve on\n\n                             -9-\n\nthe spot  often arcane  issues and tangled  factual disputes.\n\nIn   this  case,  it  is  quite  likely  that  there  was  no\n\nmisunderstanding whatever.\n\n     Still, the  difference between a total  offense level of\n\n18, with a range of 27 to 33 months, and a total level of 12,\n\nwith a range  of 10  to 16  months, is  substantial; and  the\n\nlatter's maximum 16 months is just about half of the sentence\n                \n\nactually imposed.  It takes very little effort to resolve the\n\nuncertainty.   Defense counsel  suggested at oral  argument a\n\nremand for an entirely new sentencing hearing; the government\n\nsaid  that if any remedy were needed, this court could retain\n\njurisdiction and simply ask the district court to clarify the\n\nrecord.  We have in mind a third course.\n\n     We propose  to vacate  the existing sentence  and remand\n\nthe  matter to  the  district court  for  resentencing.   The\n\ndistrict  court has already given  Garafano a chance to argue\n\nhis evidentiary position in  full and no request was  made by\n\ndefense counsel  to offer new evidence; if the district court\n\ndid  (at the earlier hearing)--or did not then but now does--\n\nfind  (independently   of  the  jury  verdict)   that  bribes\n\ncontinued until  December 1990 and were  around $100,000, the\n\ncourt is  free to say so  summarily and to reimpose  the same\n\nsentence.  No additional proceedings, or  further explanation\n\nor  findings, are required.  See United States v. Savoie, 985\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 612, 620-21 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n                             -10-\n\n     Conversely,  the district  court  is free  to order  any\n\nfurther  proceedings  it  deems  appropriate  before imposing\n\nsentence.     It   may  do   so  if   there  was   an  actual\n\nmisunderstanding   at  the  original  sentencing  as  to  the\n\ndistrict  court's authority,  or  merely  because  the  court\n\nthinks that  this would be  useful to it.   But if  the court\n\ndoes  change  the  factual  premise  on  which  it  sentences\n\nGarafano--and thereby alters the guideline  range available--\n\nwe think that  it would be within the spirit  of the rules to\n\nprovide counsel and the  defendant an opportunity to allocute\n\nagain.\n\n     The sentence, but not the conviction, is vacated and the\n                                                     \n\ncase  remanded  for  resentencing  in  accordance  with  this\n              \n\nopinion.\n\n                             -11-\n",

In or about March 1989, said Forte, he met with Garafano and agreed to the latter's demand for $8,000, without which Garafano threatened to cease authorizing work to be performed by Forte Brothers.  Forte also testified that he gave the money to Steven Tocco, the firm's supervisor for the road repair work, to deliver to Garafano.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tocco testified that he delivered the money to Garafano.  Tocco also testified that in response to further demands from Garafano, Tocco made somewhere between 12 and 20 additional payments to Garafano between April 1989 and December 1990, and that the total amount of the payments to Garafano was around $100,000.  Much of the money came from inflated billings by Forte Brothers on individual road repair and other projects for the city.  According to prosecution testimony, Garafano authorized various of these projects and expedited payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garafano himself testified and denied demanding or receiving any money from Forte Brothers.  Various of Garafano's subsidiary statements were contradicted by the director of his city department but the director had no direct knowledge of whether Garafano had received bribes.  On October 4, 1993, the jury in the second trial found Garafano guilty.  The verdict was a general verdict on the single count charged and provided no indication of which episodes the jury found to have occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 14, 1993, the trial judge held a sentencing hearing.  At the hearing defense counsel took the position that only the first payment of $8,000 in March 1989 had been adequately supported by evidence and that Tocco's testimony as to further payments was not credible.  It was apparently the defense position that after the first incident Tocco himself had been stealing from the firm and claiming falsely that the payments had been made to Garafano.  This contention was pertinent to sentencing in several respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presentence report had proposed that Garafano be sentenced under the November 1993 version of the Sentencing Guidelines which was in effect at the time of sentencing.  The report recommended that the court fix the base offense level at 10, as provided by U.S.S.G. Sec. 2C1.1(a), and that it add two levels as a specific offense adjustment because the offense involved more than one bribe or extortion.  Id. Sec. 2C1.1(b)(1).  In addition, the report recommended a further six-level adjustment based on the amount of the payment received by Garafano;  the guidelines provide a table fixing such an adjustment at six levels where the amount is greater than $70,000.  Id. Secs. 2C1.1(b)(2)(A), 2F1.1(b)(1)(G).  A payment of $8,000 would have added only two levels.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to November 1989, the guidelines did not include the two-point adjustment for multiple bribes.  Garafano's counsel objected that without the additional payments allegedly made through Tocco, the extortionate conduct would have ceased prior to the effectiveness of that guideline amendment.  Counsel argued that if the conduct did cease before the amendment, then ex post facto concerns required that the two points not be included.  Our decisions confirm that where a guideline amendment increases the sentence after the offense, the guidelines in effect at the time of the offense should be used.  See e.g., United States v. Rodriguez, 26 F.3d 4, 7-8 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More important, if Tocco's testimony were disregarded, then the total amount gained by the extortionate conduct would be only $8,000.  This would eliminate not only the two-point adjustment for multiple bribes (since there would be no second bribe proved) but also the proposed six-point adjustment based on \"the loss or gain table\".  Of course, Forte's testimony alone, not challenged at the sentencing hearing, established that Garafano had solicited a bribe in the amount of $8,000, whether or not Tocco delivered the money;  but a single $8,000 bribe would have reduced the guideline range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing defense counsel asked the court to find that the 1989 version of the guidelines applied, asserting that the jury may have based its verdict only on the first $8,000 bribe, which counsel described as \"the only corroborated event\" that the government had proved to the jury.  The court replied, \"how can you ask me to dissect what a jury has done?\"   Counsel responded that \"[t]he guidelines allow you exactly that power....\"  Pressed as to why the court should disbelieve Tocco, defense counsel offered an example of an asserted contradiction between the testimony of Tocco and other government witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor replied that Tocco's testimony had been corroborated, and then added:  \"I don't think the Court has the discretion to piecemeal the jury's verdict in this case.\"   The court replied:  \"I quite agree with you,\" adding (to defense counsel) that \"the reasons [the prosecutor] stated are ample in and of themselves.\"   The court went on to say that it agreed that \"the facts of the case reflect\" that the offense occurred between April 1989 and December 1990 and showed the receipt of between 12 and 20 payments.  Accordingly the court rejected the ex post facto claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel then went on to argue at even greater length that Tocco should not be believed.  This time the argument was to support counsel's claim that, in applying the loss or gain table, the court should treat as proved only the first $8,000.  The court listened courteously to the argument and then rejected it, saying that \"there was substantial evidence ... [that] could convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\"   Defense counsel then said that the jury could have convicted solely on the basis of the $8,000 bribe.  The court replied:  \"I'm not going to dissect this jury's verdict.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After other largely unrelated discussion, the court heard final statements from defense counsel and Garafano.  It then summed up:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have a base offense level of 10 in this case, and since there was more than one bribe, two points have to be added.  And since the amount involved approximately $100,000.00, that's an additional six points, which gives a total adjusted level of 18.  He has a criminal history category of one, which means the sentencing range is from 27 to 33 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concluding that Garafano had been motivated by \"sheer greed and nothing else,\" the court imposed a sentence of 31 months imprisonment and a $6,000 fine, together with an order requiring Garafano to make restitution of $100,000 to the city.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only issue on appeal is the defense claim that the district court erred because it allegedly refused to make an independent assessment of the Tocco testimony and make its own finding as to whether bribes of approximately $100,000 had been paid during a period extending to December 1990.  The government agrees that an independent determination was required but says that the district court made such an assessment.  We agree with the government that the district court probably did make an independent assessment but to remove the shadow of uncertainty, we have decided to remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The uncertainty is apparent from our recitation of the facts.  Normally the trial court makes its own assessment of the facts that pertain to sentencing, drawing on trial evidence, the presentence report, any evidence offered at the hearing, and other appropriate sources.  See United States v. Tavano, 12 F.3d 301, 306-07 (1st Cir.1993).  Indeed, we have held that a judge may attribute conduct to a defendant for \"relevant conduct\" purposes even where a jury has declined to convict on counts pertaining to such conduct.  United States v. Carrozza, 4 F.3d 70, 80 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1644, 128 L.Ed.2d 365 (1994);  United States v. Mocciola, 891 F.2d 13, 16-17 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the trial court could ever be bound at sentencing by the jury's determination against a defendant (e.g., through collateral estoppel) is an interesting issue but is irrelevant here:  the government agrees that the jury could in theory have convicted solely on the evidence pertaining to the first $8,000 bribe solicitation;  and since the jury delivered a general verdict there is no way to tell what it actually found as to the number of bribes.  In sum, even if a jury verdict against the defendant on a fact issue could ever constrain the sentencing judge, but cf. Tavano, 12 F.3d at 305, 307, this jury verdict could not resolve the amount and timing issues faced at sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have read the sentencing transcript in full and are inclined to think that the trial judge, an experienced and respected jurist, fully understood that he could and should decide himself when the offense ended and how much was paid.  Further, his statement quoted above (\"the facts of the case reflect ...\") is reasonably clear evidence that he did resolve those issues against Garafano and was not relying upon the jury verdict or any misinterpretation of it.  Nor does Garafano argue on appeal that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support findings at sentencing that the bribes continued to December 1990 and equaled about $100,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this were all, we would affirm without a moment's hesitation.  But we agree with Garafano that the record is at least blurred by the agreement of the trial judge and the prosecutor that the jury verdict could not be dissected.  Quite likely both meant only that peering into the verdict was infeasible and served no purpose;  but abstractly the prosecutor's words could be taken as an argument that the jury had resolved the issue of timing and amount against Garafano and that this decision was binding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor's statement--\"I don't think the Court has the discretion to piecemeal the jury's verdict in this case\"--happens to sound like a refutation of defense counsel's earlier argument to the court that \"[y]ou [the court] have the ability, the discretion in sentencing\" to determine the amount and timing of the loss.  As government counsel properly says on appeal, the prosecutor's statement was an \"unfortunate\" choice of words.  The district judge then followed the prosecutor's statement by saying, \"I quite agree with you\" and telling defense counsel that the prosecutor's reasons were \"ample\" basis for rejecting the defense position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In saying that these colloquies leave a measure of uncertainty, we do not intend the slightest criticism of either the court or counsel.  Court colloquies are not scripted events like television commercials or public speeches.  Lawyers are usually trying to advance and explain conflicting positions, and the judge is seeking to resolve on the spot often arcane issues and tangled factual disputes.  In this case, it is quite likely that there was no misunderstanding whatever.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, the difference between a total offense level of 18, with a range of 27 to 33 months, and a total level of 12, with a range of 10 to 16 months, is substantial;  and the latter's maximum 16 months is just about half of the sentence actually imposed.  It takes very little effort to resolve the uncertainty.  Defense counsel suggested at oral argument a remand for an entirely new sentencing hearing;  the government said that if any remedy were needed, this court could retain jurisdiction and simply ask the district court to clarify the record.  We have in mind a third course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We propose to vacate the existing sentence and remand the matter to the district court for resentencing.  The district court has already given Garafano a chance to argue his evidentiary position in full and no request was made by defense counsel to offer new evidence;  if the district court did (at the earlier hearing)--or did not then but now does--find (independently of the jury verdict) that bribes continued until December 1990 and were around $100,000, the court is free to say so summarily and to reimpose the same sentence.  No additional proceedings, or further explanation or findings, are required.  See United States v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 620-21 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely, the district court is free to order any further proceedings it deems appropriate before imposing sentence.  It may do so if there was an actual misunderstanding at the original sentencing as to the district court's authority, or merely because the court thinks that this would be useful to it.  But if the court does change the factual premise on which it sentences Garafano--and thereby alters the guideline range available--we think that it would be within the spirit of the rules to provide counsel and the defendant an opportunity to allocute again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence, but not the conviction, is vacated and the case remanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Sec. 1951.  The gist of the charge was that from spring 1989 to December 1990, Garafano, then an official in the Providence, Rhode Island, Department of Public Works, had extorted payments from a road paving firm doing work for the city, Forte Brothers Construction Corporation (\"Forte Brothers\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a first trial in June 1993 the jury deadlocked.  A second trial was conducted in the fall.  At trial, the government offered testimony of James Forte, vice president of Forte Brothers, that during 1988 and 1989 the firm was engaged in road repair work for the city.  In or about March 1989, said Forte, he met with Garafano and agreed to the latter's demand for $8,000, without which Garafano threatened to cease authorizing work to be performed by Forte Brothers.  Forte also testified that he gave the money to Steven Tocco, the firm's supervisor for the road repair work, to deliver to Garafano.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tocco testified that he delivered the money to Garafano.  Tocco also testified that in response to further demands from Garafano, Tocco made somewhere between 12 and 20 additional payments to Garafano between April 1989 and December 1990, and that the total amount of the payments to Garafano was around $100,000.  Much of the money came from inflated billings by Forte Brothers on individual road repair and other projects for the city.  According to prosecution testimony, Garafano authorized various of these projects and expedited payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garafano himself testified and denied demanding or receiving any money from Forte Brothers.  Various of Garafano's subsidiary statements were contradicted by the director of his city department but the director had no direct knowledge of whether Garafano had received bribes.  On October 4, 1993, the jury in the second trial found Garafano guilty.  The verdict was a general verdict on the single count charged and provided no indication of which episodes the jury found to have occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 14, 1993, the trial judge held a sentencing hearing.  At the hearing defense counsel took the position that only the first payment of $8,000 in March 1989 had been adequately supported by evidence and that Tocco's testimony as to further payments was not credible.  It was apparently the defense position that after the first incident Tocco himself had been stealing from the firm and claiming falsely that the payments had been made to Garafano.

Sec. 2C1.1(a), and that it add two levels as a specific offense adjustment because the offense involved more than one bribe or extortion.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Sec. 2C1.1(b)(1). </span> In addition, the report recommended a further six-level adjustment based on the amount of the payment received by Garafano;  the guidelines provide a table fixing such an adjustment at six levels where the amount is greater than $70,000.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Secs. 2C1.1(b)(2)(A), </span>2F1.1(b)(1)(G).

Mocciola, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533000\"><a href=\"/opinion/533000/united-states-v-gerard-peter-mocciola/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 16-17 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the trial court could ever be bound at sentencing by the jury's determination against a defendant (e.g., through collateral estoppel) is an interesting issue but is irrelevant here:  the government agrees that the jury could in theory have convicted solely on the evidence pertaining to the first $8,000 bribe solicitation;  and since the jury delivered a general verdict there is no way to tell what it actually found as to the number of bribes.  In sum, even if a jury verdict against the defendant on a fact issue could ever constrain the sentencing judge, but cf. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195113\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Tavano,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195113/united-states-v-tavano/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span>, 307, this jury verdict could not resolve the amount and timing issues faced at sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have read the sentencing transcript in full and are inclined to think that the trial judge, an experienced and respected jurist, fully understood that he could and should decide himself when the offense ended and how much was paid.  Further, his statement quoted above (\"the facts of the case reflect ...\") is reasonably clear evidence that he did resolve those issues against Garafano and was not relying upon the jury verdict or any misinterpretation of it.  Nor does Garafano argue on appeal that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support findings at sentencing that the bribes continued to December 1990 and equaled about $100,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this were all, we would affirm without a moment's hesitation.  But we agree with Garafano that the record is at least blurred by the agreement of the trial judge and the prosecutor that the jury verdict could not be dissected.  Quite likely both meant only that peering into the verdict was infeasible and served no purpose;  but abstractly the prosecutor's words could be taken as an argument that the jury had resolved the issue of timing and amount against Garafano and that this decision was binding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor's statement--\"I don't think the Court has the discretion to piecemeal the jury's verdict in this case\"--happens to sound like a refutation of defense counsel's earlier argument to the court that \"[y]ou [the court] have the ability, the discretion in sentencing\" to determine the amount and timing of the loss.  As government counsel properly says on appeal, the prosecutor's statement was an \"unfortunate\" choice of words.  The district judge then followed the prosecutor's statement by saying, \"I quite agree with you\" and telling defense counsel that the prosecutor's reasons were \"ample\" basis for rejecting the defense position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In saying that these colloquies leave a measure of uncertainty, we do not intend the slightest criticism of either the court or counsel.  Court colloquies are not scripted events like television commercials or public speeches.  Lawyers are usually trying to advance and explain conflicting positions, and the judge is seeking to resolve on the spot often arcane issues and tangled factual disputes.  In this case, it is quite likely that there was no misunderstanding whatever.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, the difference between a total offense level of 18, with a range of 27 to 33 months, and a total level of 12, with a range of 10 to 16 months, is substantial;  and the latter's maximum 16 months is just about half of the sentence actually imposed.  It takes very little effort to resolve the uncertainty.  Defense counsel suggested at oral argument a remand for an entirely new sentencing hearing;  the government said that if any remedy were needed, this court could retain jurisdiction and simply ask the district court to clarify the record.  We have in mind a third course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We propose to vacate the existing sentence and remand the matter to the district court for resentencing.  The district court has already given Garafano a chance to argue his evidentiary position in full and no request was made by defense counsel to offer new evidence;  if the district court did (at the earlier hearing)--or did not then but now does--find (independently of the jury verdict) that bribes continued until December 1990 and were around $100,000, the court is free to say so summarily and to reimpose the same sentence.  No additional proceedings, or further explanation or findings, are required.  See United States v. Savoie, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600257\"><a href=\"/opinion/600257/united-states-v-paul-j-savoie/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>, 620-21 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely, the district court is free to order any further proceedings it deems appropriate before imposing sentence.  It may do so if there was an actual misunderstanding at the original sentencing as to the district court's authority, or merely because the court thinks that this would be useful to it.  But if the court does change the factual premise on which it sentences Garafano--and thereby alters the guideline range available--we think that it would be within the spirit of the rules to provide counsel and the defendant an opportunity to allocute again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence, but not the conviction, is vacated and the case remanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
