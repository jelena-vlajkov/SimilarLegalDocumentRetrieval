(collectively \"Ralar\").   Baybank\r\n\nrecovered  in  full  its   loan  principal  and  all  accrued\r\n\nprepetition interest; only postpetition interest and fees are\r\n\nnow  at  issue.     Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  Baybank\r\n\nultimately recovered  its  prepetition  claim  in  full,  the\r\n\nbankruptcy court found that Baybank had been undersecured and\r\n\nthus was  not entitled to postpetition fees  and interest; in\r\n\nso ruling, the court relied on  its finding at a hearing held\r\n\nshortly  after the commencement of the  case that Baybank was\r\n\n\"under water.\"\r\n\nThe bankruptcy  court also rejected  Baybank's argument  that\r\n\nRalar's  failure to  adequately protect  Baybank's collateral\r\n\nentitled  Baybank to a \"superpriority\" administrative expense\r\n\nclaim for the  postpetition interest and fees.

At that\r\n\ntime,  Ralar owed Baybank  approximately $10 million, secured\r\n\nby all of Ralar's assets.  \r\n\n          Shortly  after  the Chapter  11  filing, Ralar  (as\r\n\ndebtor  in  possession) and  Baybank  reached  an impasse  in\r\n\nnegotiations concerning  Ralar's use  of cash  collateral and\r\n\ninventory during  the pendency of the  Chapter 11 proceeding.\r\n\nBaybank ultimately refused to  extend further credit to Ralar\r\n\nor  to allow  Ralar  to use  Baybank's collateral,  prompting\r\n\nRalar to move for a bankruptcy court order allowing it to use\r\n\nthe  collateral.  Over  the next four  months, the bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt held a  series of \"cash collateral  hearings,\" at which\r\n\nBaybank objected  to the continued use of  its collateral and\r\n\nsought immediate foreclosure.   At the first hearing, Baybank\r\n\nand Ralar  reached a stipulation  allowing Ralar to  use cash\r\n\ncollateral.   At  three subsequent  hearings, the  bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt issued orders allowing Ralar to continue its operations\r\n\nusing  the collateral  despite  Baybank's objection,  finding\r\n\nthat  Baybank's interests  were adequately  protected because\r\n\nRalar's continued  sales of inventory to  its customers would\r\n\nyield  a higher net return  than Baybank could  realize if it\r\n\nforeclosed.    At the  second  cash  collateral hearing,  the\r\n\nbankruptcy  court  found  that  Baybank  was   \"under  water\"\r\n\n(undersecured),  but  that  Ralar's  operating  plan  was not\r\n\nlikely to put Baybank further under water.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n            After four months  of operation under  bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt  orders allowing Ralar to use the collateral, the court\r\n\nultimately found that Ralar's plan of inventory reduction was\r\n\nno  longer protecting  Baybank's interests.   Thus,  in March\r\n\n1990  it  granted Baybank  relief  from  the automatic  stay,\r\n\npermitting Baybank to foreclose on Ralar's assets.   \r\n\n          Payments   Ralar   made  to   Baybank   during  its\r\n\npostpetition  operations  combined with  the proceeds  of the\r\n\nforeclosure were  sufficient to  repay all of  Baybank's loan\r\n\nprincipal,   all   accrued  prepetition   interest,   and  an\r\n\nunspecified amount of  postpetition interest.   Subsequent to\r\n\nthe  foreclosure, Baybank  filed a  proof of  claim for  $2.2\r\n\nmillion,   comprised   entirely   of    Baybank's   unsecured\r\n\npostpetition  interest, attorney fees,  and collection costs,\r\n\nwhich  Ralar   was  obligated   to  pay  Baybank   under  the\r\n\npreexisting loan  agreement.   Because  Baybank  already  had\r\n\nliquidated all  of Ralar's assets, this  claim was unsecured.\r\n\nHowever,  Baybank sought to recover the postpetition interest\r\n\nand   fees  as  a  so-called  \"superpriority\"  administrative\r\n\nexpense claim under 11  U.S.C.   507(b), arguing that  if its\r\n\ncollateral  had been  adequately  protected, the  foreclosure\r\n\nproceeds  would have  been  sufficient to  cover the  claimed\r\n\npostpetition interest and fees.  \r\n\n          The bankruptcy  court disallowed the  claim in  its\r\n\nentirety,   ruling  that  (1)  Baybank  was  an  undersecured\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ncreditor   and   therefore  was   not  entitled   to  recover\r\n\npostpetition interest and fees  under 11 U.S.C.   506(c), (2)\r\n\nBaybank  failed   to  demonstrate  a   failure  of   adequate\r\n\nprotection,   and  (3)   Baybank  was   not  entitled   to  a\r\n\nsuperpriority claim  under 11  U.S.C.   507(b) even  if Ralar\r\n\nhad  failed  to  provide  adequate  protection  of  Baybank's\r\n\ninterest in the  collateral.  The district court affirmed the\r\n\nbankruptcy  court's   factual   finding  that   Baybank   was\r\n\nundersecured  and found as a  matter of law  that Baybank was\r\n\nnot  entitled  to postpetition  interest  and fees  nor  to a\r\n\nsuperpriority claim for failure of adequate protection.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\nA.

The question is,  the\r\n          debtor's  proposal, is  it likely  to put\r\n          them  further under  water.   And I  find\r\n          that it  is not likely, it  is not likely\r\n          that  the debtor's proposal  will put the\r\n          secured parties further under water.3\r\n\n\"Under  water\" in  the  context of  security interests  means\r\n\nundersecured, i.e., the value of the collateral is  less than\r\n\nthe amount of  the debt.   Webster's Third New  International\r                                                                         \r\n\nDictionary 2491 (1986).  Thus, at a  fully litigated, two-day\r                      \r\n\nevidentiary  hearing   held   just  two   weeks   after   the\r\n\ncommencement of bankruptcy, the  bankruptcy judge found in no\r\n\nuncertain terms that Baybank was an undersecured creditor.4\r\n\n          Baybank argues that  the bankruptcy judge's finding\r\n\nthat  Baybank  was  undersecured  was obiter  dictum,  not  a\r                                                                \r\n\nfactual finding,  and that  the courts  below erred  in using\r\n\nthat dictum  to disallow its claim  for postpetition interest\r\n\nand  fees.  We disagree.  The bankruptcy judge stated clearly\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  There was  another secured  creditor, junior  to Baybank,\r\nalso seeking relief from the stay because of lack of adequate\r\nprotection; only Baybank is a party to this appeal.\r\n\n3.  Because  much  of  Ralar's  inventory was  seasonal,  the\r\nbankruptcy  judge  determined  that a  forced  liquidation by\r\nBaybank  would yield less than Ralar's plan to continue sales\r\nand use the proceeds to purchase new in-season inventory.  We\r\nassume that the judge's prediction proved to be correct; that\r\nwould  explain why  Baybank recovered  all its  principal and\r\nprepetition interest  in spite  of the judge's  finding that,\r\nbased on liquidation value, Baybank was \"under water.\"\r\n\n4.  There has been no suggestion, nor is it plausible on this\r\nrecord, that  Baybank was oversecured  at the time  of filing\r\nbut that the collateral value eroded substantially in the two\r\nweeks between filing and the November 1 hearing.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nthat he  was making a  finding, and there was  good reason to\r\n\nmake that finding in that context.\r\n\n          At  the hearing  where  the bankruptcy  judge found\r\n\nthat  Baybank  was \"under  water,\"  the precise  issue  to be\r\n\ndecided was  whether Baybank was adequately protected against\r\n\nerosion  in  collateral  value,  as  required  by  11  U.S.C.\r\n\n  363(e).    The parties  presented  evidence  on the  effect\r\n\nRalar's use of cash collateral would likely have on the value\r\n\nof Baybank's  collateral.  In making  the adequate protection\r\n\ndetermination,  it  was entirely  logical  for  the judge  to\r\n\nconsider the value  of the collateral relative to  the amount\r\n\nof the debt  owed Baybank.  Indeed, we think  it would be odd\r\n\nnot to  determine collateral value in  an adequate protection\r\n\nhearing.  A sufficient equity  cushion is itself a recognized\r\n\nform of  adequate protection, thus collateral  valuation is a\r\n\nlogical step in making an adequate  protection determination.\r\n\nSee, e.g., First Agric. Bank v. Jug End in the Berkshires, 46\r                                                                     \r\n\nB.R. 892, 899 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1985) (\"The classic protection\r\n\nfor a secured debt justifying continuation of the stay is the\r\n\nexistence  of an `equity  cushion.'\").  We  conclude that the\r\n\nbankruptcy judge's finding that  Baybank was undersecured was\r\n\nnot dictum, but a factual finding made as part of an adequate\r\n\nprotection determination.  Baybank has not shown that finding\r\n\nto be clearly erroneous.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          Baybank  also  makes  this  related  argument:    a\r\n\nfinding  that a creditor  is adequately protected,  made at a\r\n\nhearing early  in a Chapter 11  case, cannot be binding  at a\r\n\nlater hearing to determine whether that protection ultimately\r\n\nproved  inadequate.   If  such a  finding  were binding,  the\r\n\nargument  goes, then a court that once found protection to be\r\n\nadequate  could  never later  find  that  the protection  had\r\n\nfailed, and section 507(b), which provides  a \"superpriority\"\r\n\nclaim where  adequate protection  fails, would be  rendered a\r\n\nnullity.  We agree with that argument, as far as it goes, but\r\n\nit falls short in this appeal.  We find that Baybank's appeal\r\n\nis foreclosed by  the bankruptcy court's finding  at the cash\r\n\ncollateral  hearing that  Baybank was  undersecured, not  its\r                                                               \r\n\nfinding that Baybank  was adequately protected.   We need not\r                                                          \r\n\ndetermine whether there was  a failure of adequate protection\r\n\nbecause  (1) Baybank,  as  an undersecured  creditor, is  not\r\n\nentitled to  postpetition interest and  fees under    506(b)5\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Baybank might have argued, but did not, that even a valid\r\nfinding as to collateral value made at an adequate protection\r\nhearing  has no res judicata effect when valuations are to be\r                                        \r\nmade  for other purposes at later proceedings.  See, e.g., In\r                                                                         \r\nre  Richardson,  97  B.R.  161, 162  (Bankr.  W.D.N.Y.  1989)\r                          \r\n(valuation of  creditor's collateral made for  one purpose is\r\nnot res  judicata as  to later  valuation in  same bankruptcy\r                             \r\ncase for  different purposes).  Instead,  Baybank avoided the\r\nres  judicata issue  by arguing that  \"The issue  before this\r                         \r\nCourt is not the value of Baybank's collateral.  The material\r\nissue  is  whether or  not  the  Bankruptcy Court's  adequate\r\nprotection order failed. .  . . Thus, the valuation  issue is\r\nnot  material  to  this  appeal.\"    We  will   not  consider\r\npotentially  applicable  arguments  that  are   not  squarely\r\npresented  in a  party's appellate  brief.

Baybank has failed to present a plausible argument\r\n\non the threshold issue of whether in fact it suffered a loss,\r\n\ngiven that it recovered its prepetition claim in full.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  11 U.S.C.   507(b) provides: \r\n\n          If  the trustee, under  section 362, 363,\r\n          or 364 of  this title, provides  adequate\r\n          protection of the interest of a holder of\r\n          a claim secured by  a lien on property of\r\n          the debtor and  if, notwithstanding  such\r\n          protection,  such  creditor  has a  claim\r\n          allowable under subsection (a)(1) of this\r\n          section arising from  the stay of  action\r\n          against such property  under section  362\r\n          of this  title, from  the  use, sale,  or\r\n          lease  of such property under section 363\r\n          of this title, or  from the granting of a\r\n          lien under section 364(d) of  this title,\r\n          then  such  creditor's  claim under  such\r\n          subsection shall have priority over every\r\n          other claim under such subsection.\r\n\nA \"claim  allowable under subsection (a)(1)  of this section\"\r\nis, by further cross-reference, an  \"administrative expense[]\r\nallowed  under section  503(b).\"   See 11  U.S.C.  507(a)(1).\r                                                  \r\nThe  relevant  part  of    503(b)  allows  as  administrative\r\nexpenses  \"the  actual,  necessary  costs  and  expenses   of\r\npreserving the estate.\"  See 11 U.S.C.   503(b).\r                                        \r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          The logical structure of Baybank's argument is: (1)\r\n\nRalar's  unprofitable  operations using  Baybank's collateral\r\n\nresulted  in an  erosion  in the  total  value of  collateral\r\n\nsecuring Baybank's  loan; (2) if the collateral  had not been\r\n\nso eroded, the collateral value  would have exceeded the debt\r\n\nowed Baybank,  and as an  oversecured creditor it  would have\r\n\nbeen  eligible for  postpetition  interest and  fees under   \r\n\n506(c);  (3)  thus,  Ralar's  use of  the  collateral  caused\r\n\nBaybank  to suffer a loss  to the extent  of the postpetition\r\n\ninterest and fees it  would have recovered had there  been no\r\n\nerosion in  collateral value, and that loss is a \"claim . . .\r\n\narising from the stay of  action against [its collateral]\" as\r\n\nprovided in   507(b);  (4) Ralar's use of the  collateral and\r\n\ntherefore  the  resultant  \"loss\" to  Baybank  were  \"actual,\r\n\nnecessary costs and expenses  of preserving the estate\" which\r\n\nqualify as  an administrative claim under    503(b); and, (5)\r\n\nthe  erosion in collateral  value resulted from  a failure of\r\n\nadequate  protection,  thus entitling  Baybank  to receive  a\r\n\n  507(b)  \"superpriority\"  for  its    503(b)  administrative\r\n\nexpense claim.  This fascinating argument has led the parties\r\n\nand two courts through a  complex maze of ambiguous statutory\r\n\nprovisions and opaque, inconsistent case law.  We decline the\r\n\ninvitation  to enter the  labyrinth ourselves, believing that\r\n\nwe need go no further than its threshold.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n          Because we find no  error in the bankruptcy judge's\r\n\nfactual  finding that Baybank  was undersecured,  we conclude\r\n\nthat Baybank had no  entitlement to postpetition interest and\r\n\nfees  and thus  suffered no loss  that might  give rise  to a\r\n\nclaim under    503(b)  and 507(b).  Put  differently, even if\r\n\nthere  was  somehow  a  failure  of  adequate  protection  (a\r\n\nquestion we do not reach), Baybank has no claim \"arising from\r\n\nthe stay of action\",  see   507(b), because it  recovered its\r                                     \r\n\nprepetition claim  in full; as an undersecured creditor it is\r\n\nentitled to  no more.   On the contrary,  it appears (as  the\r\n\nbankruptcy   judge  concluded)   that  Ralar's  use   of  the\r\n\ncollateral  benefitted Baybank,  allowing it  to  recover its\r                                  \r\n\nprepetition claim in full in spite of its being  undersecured\r\n\nat the start of the Chapter 11 case.  In any event, it simply\r\n\nis  not necessary to address  whether there was  a failure of\r\n\nadequate protection where an undersecured creditor ultimately\r\n\nrecovers  its prepetition claim  in full.   We  conclude that\r\n\nRalar's  use  of  Baybank's  collateral  caused  no  loss  to\r\n\nBaybank, therefore Baybank has  no claim under     503(b) and\r\n\n507(b).\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                          CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          For  the reasons articulated  above, we  affirm the\r\n\ndistrict court's judgment.\r\n\n          Affirmed.

(collectively \"Ralar\").  Baybank recovered in full its loan principal and all accrued prepetition interest;  only postpetition interest and fees are now at issue.  Notwithstanding the fact that Baybank ultimately recovered its prepetition claim in full, the bankruptcy court found that Baybank had been undersecured and thus was not entitled to postpetition fees and interest;  in so ruling, the court relied on its finding at a hearing held shortly after the commencement of the case that Baybank was \"under water.\"   The bankruptcy court also rejected Baybank's argument that Ralar's failure to adequately protect Baybank's collateral entitled Baybank to a \"superpriority\" administrative expense claim for the postpetition interest and fees.  The district court affirmed, and we now affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 16, 1989, Ralar, a wholesale distributor of household and hardware items, filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.  At that time, Ralar owed Baybank approximately $10 million, secured by all of Ralar's assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the Chapter 11 filing, Ralar (as debtor in possession) and Baybank reached an impasse in negotiations concerning Ralar's use of cash collateral and inventory during the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceeding.  Baybank ultimately refused to extend further credit to Ralar or to allow Ralar to use Baybank's collateral, prompting Ralar to move for a bankruptcy court order allowing it to use the collateral.  Over the next four months, the bankruptcy court held a series of \"cash collateral hearings,\" at which Baybank objected to the continued use of its collateral and sought immediate foreclosure.  At the first hearing, Baybank and Ralar reached a stipulation allowing Ralar to use cash collateral.  At three subsequent hearings, the bankruptcy court issued orders allowing Ralar to continue its operations using the collateral despite Baybank's objection, finding that Baybank's interests were adequately protected because Ralar's continued sales of inventory to its customers would yield a higher net return than Baybank could realize if it foreclosed.  At the second cash collateral hearing, the bankruptcy court found that Baybank was \"under water\" (undersecured), but that Ralar's operating plan was not likely to put Baybank further under water.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After four months of operation under bankruptcy court orders allowing Ralar to use the collateral, the court ultimately found that Ralar's plan of inventory reduction was no longer protecting Baybank's interests.  Thus, in March 1990 it granted Baybank relief from the automatic stay, permitting Baybank to foreclose on Ralar's assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Payments Ralar made to Baybank during its postpetition operations combined with the proceeds of the foreclosure were sufficient to repay all of Baybank's loan principal, all accrued prepetition interest, and an unspecified amount of postpetition interest.  Subsequent to the foreclosure, Baybank filed a proof of claim for $2.2 million, comprised entirely of Baybank's unsecured postpetition interest, attorney fees, and collection costs, which Ralar was obligated to pay Baybank under the preexisting loan agreement.  Because Baybank already had liquidated all of Ralar's assets, this claim was unsecured.  However, Baybank sought to recover the postpetition interest and fees as a so-called \"superpriority\" administrative expense claim under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 507(b), arguing that if its collateral had been adequately protected, the foreclosure proceeds would have been sufficient to cover the claimed postpetition interest and fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court disallowed the claim in its entirety, ruling that (1) Baybank was an undersecured creditor and therefore was not entitled to recover postpetition interest and fees under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 506(c), (2) Baybank failed to demonstrate a failure of adequate protection, and (3) Baybank was not entitled to a superpriority claim under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 507(b) even if Ralar had failed to provide adequate protection of Baybank's interest in the collateral.  The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court's factual finding that Baybank was undersecured and found as a matter of law that Baybank was not entitled to postpetition interest and fees nor to a superpriority claim for failure of adequate protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A.

Under the Bankruptcy Code, only \"oversecured\" creditors are entitled to receive postpetition interest and loan-related fees and costs.  11 U.S.C.

A creditor is oversecured when the value of its collateral exceeds the amount of its claim;  postpetition interest and fees are allowable only to the extent of that oversecurity.

Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2491 (1986).  Thus, at a fully litigated, two-day evidentiary hearing held just two weeks after the commencement of bankruptcy, the bankruptcy judge found in no uncertain terms that Baybank was an undersecured creditor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baybank argues that the bankruptcy judge's finding that Baybank was undersecured was obiter dictum, not a factual finding, and that the courts below erred in using that dictum to disallow its claim for postpetition interest and fees.  We disagree.  The bankruptcy judge stated clearly that he was making a finding, and there was good reason to make that finding in that context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing where the bankruptcy judge found that Baybank was \"under water,\" the precise issue to be decided was whether Baybank was adequately protected against erosion in collateral value, as required by 11 U.S.C. Sec. 363(e).  The parties presented evidence on the effect Ralar's use of cash collateral would likely have on the value of Baybank's collateral.  In making the adequate protection determination, it was entirely logical for the judge to consider the value of the collateral relative to the amount of the debt owed Baybank.  Indeed, we think it would be odd not to determine collateral value in an adequate protection hearing.  A sufficient equity cushion is itself a recognized form of adequate protection, thus collateral valuation is a logical step in making an adequate protection determination.  See, e.g., First Agric.  Bank v. Jug End in the Berkshires, 46 B.R. 892, 899 (Bankr.D.Mass.1985) (\"The classic protection for a secured debt justifying continuation of the stay is the existence of an 'equity cushion.' \").  We conclude that the bankruptcy judge's finding that Baybank was undersecured was not dictum, but a factual finding made as part of an adequate protection determination.  Baybank has not shown that finding to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baybank also makes this related argument:  a finding that a creditor is adequately protected, made at a hearing early in a Chapter 11 case, cannot be binding at a later hearing to determine whether that protection ultimately proved inadequate.  If such a finding were binding, the argument goes, then a court that once found protection to be adequate could never later find that the protection had failed, and section 507(b), which provides a \"superpriority\" claim where adequate protection fails, would be rendered a nullity.  We agree with that argument, as far as it goes, but it falls short in this appeal.  We find that Baybank's appeal is foreclosed by the bankruptcy court's finding at the cash collateral hearing that Baybank was undersecured, not its finding that Baybank was adequately protected.   We need not determine whether there was a failure of adequate protection because (1) Baybank, as an undersecured creditor, is not entitled to postpetition interest and fees under Sec. 506(b)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and (2) Ralar's use of the collateral caused no harm or loss to Baybank that could give rise to a claim under Sec. 507(b), as we explain further below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>C.

Sec. 507(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The basis for Baybank's claim is that it \"suffered a loss \" due to Ralar's use of the collateral;  most of its brief focuses, however, not on the nature or extent of that claimed loss, but on how such a loss can become an allowable superpriority claim under Sec. 507(b).  Baybank has failed to present a plausible argument on the threshold issue of whether in fact it suffered a loss, given that it recovered its prepetition claim in full.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The logical structure of Baybank's argument is:  (1) Ralar's unprofitable operations using Baybank's collateral resulted in an erosion in the total value of collateral securing Baybank's loan;  (2) if the collateral had not been so eroded, the collateral value would have exceeded the debt owed Baybank, and as an oversecured creditor it would have been eligible for postpetition interest and fees under Sec. 506(c);  (3) thus, Ralar's use of the collateral caused Baybank to suffer a loss to the extent of the postpetition interest and fees it would have recovered had there been no erosion in collateral value, and that loss is a \"claim ... arising from the stay of action against [its collateral]\" as provided in Sec. 507(b);  (4) Ralar's use of the collateral and therefore the resultant \"loss\" to Baybank were \"actual, necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate\" which qualify as an administrative claim under Sec. 503(b);  and, (5) the erosion in collateral value resulted from a failure of adequate protection, thus entitling Baybank to receive a Sec. 507(b) \"superpriority\" for its Sec. 503(b) administrative expense claim.  This fascinating argument has led the parties and two courts through a complex maze of ambiguous statutory provisions and opaque, inconsistent case law.  We decline the invitation to enter the labyrinth ourselves, believing that we need go no further than its threshold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we find no error in the bankruptcy judge's factual finding that Baybank was undersecured, we conclude that Baybank had no entitlement to postpetition interest and fees and thus suffered no loss that might give rise to a claim under Secs. 503(b) and 507(b).  Put differently, even if there was somehow a failure of adequate protection (a question we do not reach), Baybank has no claim \"arising from the stay of action\", see Sec. 507(b), because it recovered its prepetition claim in full;  as an undersecured creditor it is entitled to no more.  On the contrary, it appears (as the bankruptcy judge concluded) that Ralar's use of the collateral benefitted Baybank, allowing it to recover its prepetition claim in full in spite of its being undersecured at the start of the Chapter 11 case.  In any event, it simply is not necessary to address whether there was a failure of adequate protection where an undersecured creditor ultimately recovers its prepetition claim in full.  We conclude that Ralar's use of Baybank's collateral caused no loss to Baybank, therefore Baybank has no claim under Secs. 503(b) and 507(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons articulated above, we affirm the district court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

Instead, Baybank avoided the res judicata issue by arguing that \"The issue before this Court is not the value of Baybank's collateral.

(collectively \"Ralar\").  Baybank recovered in full its loan principal and all accrued prepetition interest;  only postpetition interest and fees are now at issue.  Notwithstanding the fact that Baybank ultimately recovered its prepetition claim in full, the bankruptcy court found that Baybank had been undersecured and thus was not entitled to postpetition fees and interest;  in so ruling, the court relied on its finding at a hearing held shortly after the commencement of the case that Baybank was \"under water.\"   The bankruptcy court also rejected Baybank's argument that Ralar's failure to adequately protect Baybank's collateral entitled Baybank to a \"superpriority\" administrative expense claim for the postpetition interest and fees.  The district court affirmed, and we now affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 16, 1989, Ralar, a wholesale distributor of household and hardware items, filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.  At that time, Ralar owed Baybank approximately $10 million, secured by all of Ralar's assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the Chapter 11 filing, Ralar (as debtor in possession) and Baybank reached an impasse in negotiations concerning Ralar's use of cash collateral and inventory during the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceeding.  Baybank ultimately refused to extend further credit to Ralar or to allow Ralar to use Baybank's collateral, prompting Ralar to move for a bankruptcy court order allowing it to use the collateral.  Over the next four months, the bankruptcy court held a series of \"cash collateral hearings,\" at which Baybank objected to the continued use of its collateral and sought immediate foreclosure.  At the first hearing, Baybank and Ralar reached a stipulation allowing Ralar to use cash collateral.  At three subsequent hearings, the bankruptcy court issued orders allowing Ralar to continue its operations using the collateral despite Baybank's objection, finding that Baybank's interests were adequately protected because Ralar's continued sales of inventory to its customers would yield a higher net return than Baybank could realize if it foreclosed.  At the second cash collateral hearing, the bankruptcy court found that Baybank was \"under water\" (undersecured), but that Ralar's operating plan was not likely to put Baybank further under water.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After four months of operation under bankruptcy court orders allowing Ralar to use the collateral, the court ultimately found that Ralar's plan of inventory reduction was no longer protecting Baybank's interests.  Thus, in March 1990 it granted Baybank relief from the automatic stay, permitting Baybank to foreclose on Ralar's assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Payments Ralar made to Baybank during its postpetition operations combined with the proceeds of the foreclosure were sufficient to repay all of Baybank's loan principal, all accrued prepetition interest, and an unspecified amount of postpetition interest.  Subsequent to the foreclosure, Baybank filed a proof of claim for $2.2 million, comprised entirely of Baybank's unsecured postpetition interest, attorney fees, and collection costs, which Ralar was obligated to pay Baybank under the preexisting loan agreement.  Because Baybank already had liquidated all of Ralar's assets, this claim was unsecured.  However, Baybank sought to recover the postpetition interest and fees as a so-called \"superpriority\" administrative expense claim under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 507(b), arguing that if its collateral had been adequately protected, the foreclosure proceeds would have been sufficient to cover the claimed postpetition interest and fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court disallowed the claim in its entirety, ruling that (1) Baybank was an undersecured creditor and therefore was not entitled to recover postpetition interest and fees under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 506(c), (2) Baybank failed to demonstrate a failure of adequate protection, and (3) Baybank was not entitled to a superpriority claim under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 507(b) even if Ralar had failed to provide adequate protection of Baybank's interest in the collateral.  The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court's factual finding that Baybank was undersecured and found as a matter of law that Baybank was not entitled to postpetition interest and fees nor to a superpriority claim for failure of adequate protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A.

Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2491 (1986).  Thus, at a fully litigated, two-day evidentiary hearing held just two weeks after the commencement of bankruptcy, the bankruptcy judge found in no uncertain terms that Baybank was an undersecured creditor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baybank argues that the bankruptcy judge's finding that Baybank was undersecured was obiter dictum, not a factual finding, and that the courts below erred in using that dictum to disallow its claim for postpetition interest and fees.  We disagree.  The bankruptcy judge stated clearly that he was making a finding, and there was good reason to make that finding in that context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing where the bankruptcy judge found that Baybank was \"under water,\" the precise issue to be decided was whether Baybank was adequately protected against erosion in collateral value, as required by 11 U.S.C. Sec. 363(e).  The parties presented evidence on the effect Ralar's use of cash collateral would likely have on the value of Baybank's collateral.  In making the adequate protection determination, it was entirely logical for the judge to consider the value of the collateral relative to the amount of the debt owed Baybank.  Indeed, we think it would be odd not to determine collateral value in an adequate protection hearing.  A sufficient equity cushion is itself a recognized form of adequate protection, thus collateral valuation is a logical step in making an adequate protection determination.  See, e.g., First Agric.  Bank v. Jug End in the Berkshires, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1888806\"><a href=\"/opinion/1888806/in-re-jug-end-in-the-berkshires-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">892</span></a></span>, 899 (Bankr.D.Mass.1985) (\"The classic protection for a secured debt justifying continuation of the stay is the existence of an 'equity cushion.' \").  We conclude that the bankruptcy judge's finding that Baybank was undersecured was not dictum, but a factual finding made as part of an adequate protection determination.  Baybank has not shown that finding to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baybank also makes this related argument:  a finding that a creditor is adequately protected, made at a hearing early in a Chapter 11 case, cannot be binding at a later hearing to determine whether that protection ultimately proved inadequate.  If such a finding were binding, the argument goes, then a court that once found protection to be adequate could never later find that the protection had failed, and section 507(b), which provides a \"superpriority\" claim where adequate protection fails, would be rendered a nullity.  We agree with that argument, as far as it goes, but it falls short in this appeal.  We find that Baybank's appeal is foreclosed by the bankruptcy court's finding at the cash collateral hearing that Baybank was undersecured, not its finding that Baybank was adequately protected.   We need not determine whether there was a failure of adequate protection because (1) Baybank, as an undersecured creditor, is not entitled to postpetition interest and fees under Sec. 506(b)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and (2) Ralar's use of the collateral caused no harm or loss to Baybank that could give rise to a claim under Sec. 507(b), as we explain further below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>C.

Costs to the appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 11 U.S.C. Sec. 506(b) provides in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>To the extent that an allowed secured claim is secured by property the value of which ... is greater than the amount of such claim, there shall be allowed to the holder of such claim, interest on such claim, and any reasonable fees, costs, or charges provided for under the agreement under which such claim arose.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> There was another secured creditor, junior to Baybank, also seeking relief from the stay because of lack of adequate protection;  only Baybank is a party to this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Because much of Ralar's inventory was seasonal, the bankruptcy judge determined that a forced liquidation by Baybank would yield less than Ralar's plan to continue sales and use the proceeds to purchase new in-season inventory.  We assume that the judge's prediction proved to be correct;  that would explain why Baybank recovered all its principal and prepetition interest in spite of the judge's finding that, based on liquidation value, Baybank was \"under water.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> There has been no suggestion, nor is it plausible on this record, that Baybank was oversecured at the time of filing but that the collateral value eroded substantially in the two weeks between filing and the November 1 hearing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Baybank might have argued, but did not, that even a valid finding as to collateral value made at an adequate protection hearing has no res judicata effect when valuations are to be made for other purposes at later proceedings.  See, e.g., In re Richardson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1533570\"><a href=\"/opinion/1533570/in-re-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span>, 162 (Bankr.W.D.N.Y.1989) (valuation of creditor's collateral made for one purpose is not res judicata as to later valuation in same bankruptcy case for different purposes).  Instead, Baybank avoided the res judicata issue by arguing that \"The issue before this Court is not the value of Baybank's collateral.  The material issue is whether or not the Bankruptcy Court's adequate protection order failed....  Thus, the valuation issue is not material to this appeal.\"   We will not consider potentially applicable arguments that are not squarely presented in a party's appellate brief.  See, e.g., United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (appellate arguments not presented \"squarely and distinctly\" are deemed waived)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> 11 U.S.C. Sec. 507(b) provides:</p>\n        <p>If the trustee, under section 362, 363, or 364 of this title, provides adequate protection of the interest of a holder of a claim secured by a lien on property of the debtor and if, notwithstanding such protection, such creditor has a claim allowable under subsection (a)(1) of this section arising from the stay of action against such property under section 362 of this title, from the use, sale, or lease of such property under section 363 of this title, or from the granting of a lien under section 364(d) of this title, then such creditor's claim under such subsection shall have priority over every other claim under such subsection.</p>\n        <p>A \"claim allowable under subsection (a)(1) of this section\" is, by further cross-reference, an \"administrative expense[ ] allowed under section 503(b).\"   See 11 U.S.C. Sec. 507(a)(1).  The relevant part of Sec. 503(b) allows as administrative expenses \"the actual, necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate.\"   See 11 U.S.C.
