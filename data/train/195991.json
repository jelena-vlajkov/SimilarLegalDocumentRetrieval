After  determining  that  the\r                    SELYA,  Circuit  Judge.\r                                          \r\n\nUnited States Postal Service  (the Service) wrongfully discharged\r\n\nThomas Lussier because of his post-traumatic stress disorder, the\r\n\ndistrict  court  made  an  award that  included  future  damages,\r\n\nsometimes called \"front pay.\" Both parties consider  the award to\r\n\nbe  a dead  letter.    Their  cross-appeals  pose  two  kinds  of\r\n\nquestions.   The  principal  inquiry  implicates  the  collateral\r\n\nsource  rule and requires us  to decide whether  a district court\r\n\nmay  tailor a  front  pay  award,  stemming  from  a  finding  of\r\n\ndisability discrimination under  the Rehabilitation Act of  1973,\r\n\nPub.  L.  No. 93-112,  87 Stat.  355 (codified  as amended  at 29\r\n\nU.S.C.     701-796i),  to  account for  an  increase in  Veterans\r\n\nAdministration (VA) benefits occasioned by the adverse employment\r\n\naction.   The  second inquiry  also touches  upon the  collateral\r\n\nsource rule, but turns on a determination of when, and under what\r\n\ncircumstances, a  district court, after the  parties have rested,\r\n\nmay  solicit and consider factual information germane to an issue\r\n\nin the case without formally reopening the record.\r\n\n          On the first issue, we hold that it is within the trial\r\n\ncourt's discretion to tailor a front pay award to take account of\r\n\ncollateral benefits in a discrimination case, and that  the court\r\n\nacted within the realm of this discretion in the case at bar.  On\r\n\nthe  second issue,  we hold  that  once the  record is  closed, a\r\n\ndistrict  court, absent  waiver  or consent,  ordinarily may  not\r\n\nreceive additional factual information  of a kind not susceptible\r\n\nto judicial  notice  unless  it  fully  reopens  the  record  and\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nanimates  the   panoply  of  evidentiary  rules   and  procedural\r\n\nsafeguards customarily  available to  litigants.  Finding,  as we\r\n\ndo, that the district court transgressed this rule, we cancel the\r\n\naward and stamp the matter \"returned to sender.\"\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Lussier  sued his  quondam employer in  Maine's federal\r\n\ndistrict court alleging, inter alia, that  his discharge from the\r                                             \r\n\nService on  March 4, 1992, amounted  to disability discrimination\r\n\nin violation of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29\r\n\nU.S.C.   791.1  A bench trial ensued.  Since  these appeals focus\r\n\nexclusively on the front pay award and  do not concern either the\r\n\nantecedent  question  of  liability  or the  propriety  of  other\r\n\nremedies, we discuss only  the evidence relating to the  form and\r\n\namount of front pay.\r\n\n          The plaintiff's expert, Dr. Allan McCausland, testified\r\n\nthat,  had Lussier not been fired, his future earnings and fringe\r\n\nbenefits  over a  projected  25-year work  expectancy would  have\r\n\naggregated  between  $790,805  and  $1,067,193  when  reduced  to\r\n\npresent  value.   The Service did  not directly  contradict these\r\n\nestimates,  but introduced  evidence that  Lussier's cloud  had a\r\n\nsmall  silver lining;  he had  been receiving  VA benefits  for a\r\n\nmilitary-service-related   disability,   and  the   circumstances\r\n\nsurrounding  his ouster  from  the post  office exacerbated  this\r\n\ndisability and triggered an increase in those benefits.  Moreover\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The named defendant is the Postmaster General, but, for all\r\nintents  and purposes, the Service is the real party in interest,\r\nand we treat it as such.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n  it  is said, after all,  that the postman always  rings twice  \r\n\nPatricia Asdourian, a Postal  Service human resources specialist,\r\n\ntestified  that  Lussier  would  also   be  receiving  disability\r\n\nbenefits through the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) as an\r\n\nincident of his discharge.  Lussier had applied for CSRS benefits\r\n\nonly a few weeks before trial and the precise  benefit level was,\r\n\ntherefore,   unknown.    Nonetheless,  Asdourian  predicted  that\r\n\nLussier's CSRS benefits would be in the neighborhood of $1185 per\r\n\nmonth.  The  Service argued that  the present value  of both  the\r\n\nincrease  in VA benefits (calculated to be $358,401) and the CSRS\r\n\ndisability payments should be deducted from any front pay.\r\n\n          On  November  9,  1993,  the  parties  rested  and  the\r\n\ndistrict court took the case under advisement.  In due course, it\r\n\nfound  that  the Service  had  discriminated  against Lussier  on\r\n\naccount of his  disability in violation of 29 U.S.C.    791.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nLussier v. Runyon, No. 92-397-P-H, 1994  WL 129776, at *1 (D. Me.\r                           \r\n\nMar.  1,  1994) (Lussier  I).   The court  made  an award  to the\r                                     \r\n\nplaintiff, see  id. at *11,  but declined to  order reinstatement\r                             \r\n\nbecause,  given  the sequelae  of  the firing,  Lussier  could no\r\n\nlonger  perform his accustomed duties.  As to future damages, the\r\n\ncourt  found that Lussier would probably be capable at some point\r\n\nof  returning to  lighter, lower-paying  work, and  estimated the\r\n\npresent  value of Lussier's  net future lost  earnings and fringe\r\n\nbenefits to be  $790,805.  See id. at *9.   The court also found,\r                                            \r\n\nhowever, that Lussier was slated to receive increased VA benefits\r\n\nworth $358,401 on a present-value basis.  It  determined that, to\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nprevent  a possible  windfall, these  benefits should  offset the\r\n\nrecovery Lussier otherwise might obtain as front pay.  See id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n*9-*11.\r\n\n          The court  adopted  essentially the  same reasoning  in\r\n\nrespect to  CSRS benefits,  concluding that these  benefits, like\r\n\nthe VA  benefits, should  be factored  into  Lussier's front  pay\r\n\naward to  prevent overcompensation.   See  id. at *11  n.7.   But\r                                                        \r\n\nthere was a rub:  declaring itself \"unable to determine Lussier's\r\n\nnet  economic  loss  without  knowing the  outcome  of  his  CSRS\r\n\napplication,\"  id.  at *11,  the  court deferred  entry  of final\r                            \r\n\njudgment and ordered the  parties to file reports within  30 days\r\n\nconcerning  the outcome  or status  of Lussier's  application for\r\n\nCSRS benefits.\r\n\n          Though  objecting  to  the  court's   request,  Lussier\r\n\ncomplied under  protest.  He  submitted status reports  (the last\r\n\ndated  May 2,  1994) disclosing  that he  was receiving  $390 per\r\n\nmonth in CSRS benefits on an interim basis \"pending determination\r\n\nof his  final entitlement.\"   Lussier v. Runyon,  No. 92-397-P-H,\r                                                         \r\n\n1994 WL  247873, at *1 (D.  Me. May 24, 1994) (Lussier  II).  The\r                                                                    \r\n\nService,  by contrast,  gave  the court  no concrete  information\r\n\nwithin the 30-day  period.   It then compounded  its omission  by\r\n\nignoring the  court's instruction, issued on  April 21, directing\r\n\nit to respond  within ten days.  Judge  Hornby, unwilling to wait\r\n\nany longer, entered final judgment on May 24, 1994.  Based mainly\r\n\non  the lack of  any submission by the  Service, the judge seized\r\n\nupon  the figure of $390 per month, computed the present value of\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nthese monthly payments over Lussier's work expectancy ($112,723),\r\n\nand offset  this amount  against the  potential front  pay award.\r\n\nThe  court  thereupon  entered  a final  judgment  that  included\r\n\n$320,000  in  front pay  (representing  $790,805  in future  lost\r\n\nearnings, minus $358,401 in increased VA benefits, minus $112,723\r\n\nin CSRS benefits).\r\n\n          Three days later, the  Service moved to alter  or amend\r\n\nthe judgment,  Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), \"to reflect the fact that a\r\n\nfinal calculation of the plaintiff's [CSRS] disability retirement\r\n\nannuity  has  now  been  made,  resulting  in  a  monthly payment\r\n\neffective March 1, 1994, in the amount  of $1,111.\"  The district\r\n\ncourt denied the motion, writing that:\r\n\n          The defendant has already had more generosity\r\n          than it deserves from my initial reopening of\r\n          the trial record  and extensions  thereafter.\r\n          Although the plaintiff  may realize  somewhat\r\n          of  a \"windfall\"  as a  result, awarding  the\r\n          defendant relief would make a mockery of  all\r\n          judicial deadlines and the closing of a trial\r\n          record.\r\n\nBoth parties appeal.\r\n\nII.  COLLATERAL BENEFITS\r          II.  COLLATERAL BENEFITS\r\n\n          These  appeals pose  an  important question:   In  what\r\n\nmanner,  if any,  does the  collateral source  rule    which bars\r\n\nresort to collateral benefits  in connection with the calculation\r\n\nof pecuniary damage awards, see 1 Dan B. Dobbs, Law of Remedies  \r                                                                         \r\n\n3.8(1), at 372-73 (2d ed. 1993) (describing the collateral source\r\n\nrule as providing \"that benefits received by the plaintiff from a\r\n\nsource collateral to the defendant may not be used to reduce that\r\n\ndefendant's liability for  damages\")   apply  to awards of  front\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\npay?    We respond  by  holding  that  insofar as  front  pay  is\r\n\nconcerned,  the  effect to  be  given  to collateral  benefits   \r\n\nwhatever their source   is within the equitable discretion of the\r\n\ndistrict  court.2  Applying this  general principle, we rule that\r\n\nthe  court below acted within the proper sphere of its discretion\r\n\nin  tailoring the  plaintiff's  front pay  award  to account  for\r\n\ncollateral  benefits received  by  the plaintiff  as a  traceable\r\n\nconsequence of the defendant's statutory violation.\r\n\n                    A.  The Letter of the Law.\r                              A.  The Letter of the Law.\r                                                       \r\n\n          The  Rehabilitation Act  makes available  in disability\r\n\ndiscrimination cases the remedies authorized  by Title VII of the\r\n\nCivil Rights Act  of 1964, see 29 U.S.C.    794a(a)(1), and Title\r                                        \r\n\nVII, in turn, provides that a court may order \"affirmative action\r\n\n. .  . which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or\r\n\nhiring of employees, with or without back pay . . ., or any other\r\n\nequitable relief as  the court  deems appropriate,\"  42 U.S.C.   \r\n\n2000e-5(g).   Under this generous language,  courts commonly have\r\n\nrecognized front pay as  a condign remedy.

In light  of\r\n\nthem, we hold  that front  pay is an  available equitable  remedy\r\n\nunder  Title  VII  and,  hence,  under  the  Rehabilitation  Act.\r\n\nNevertheless, confirming the propriety of the remedy merely takes\r\n\nus  to  a  way  station,  not to  our  destination.    A  further\r\n\nexpedition must  be mounted if  we are to plot  the terrain where\r\n\nthe  collateral  source  rule  and the  tenets  that  inform  the\r\n\ncomputation of front pay intersect.\r\n\n          We start  along this route by  acknowledging that front\r\n\npay, within  the employment discrimination universe, is generally\r\n\nequitable  in nature.  See, e.g., Shore v. Federal Express Corp.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n42 F.3d  373, 377-78 (6th Cir. 1994).

See, e.g., id.; Saulpaugh, 4 F.3d\r                                                                   \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nat 145;  2 Dobbs,  supra,    6.10(4),  at 214.    This court  has\r                                  \r\n\nconsistently reached the same conclusion with regard to front pay\r\n\nin the ADEA  context, see,  e.g., Powers v.  Grinnell Corp.,  915\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d 34, 42-43 (1st Cir. 1990); Wildman, 771 F.2d at  616, and we\r                                                 \r\n\nperceive  no  reason  why   front  pay  should  be  characterized\r\n\ndifferently in respect to  its dispensation under Title VII  and,\r\n\ncorrespondingly,  under   the  Rehabilitation  Act.3    We  rule,\r\n\ntherefore, that statutes such as Title VII and the Rehabilitation\r\n\nAct  afford trial courts wide latitude to award or withhold front\r\n\npay  according  to  established  principles  of  equity  and  the\r\n\nidiocratic circumstances of each case.\r\n\n          We  think  it  follows   from  this  premise  that  the\r\n\nlogically derivative question  of whether a  front pay award,  if\r\n\ngranted, may be tailored to take collateral benefits into account\r\n\nis also within the court's equitable discretion.  This conclusion\r\n\nis supported  not only by  the brute  force of logic,  see United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v.

After all,  the dispensation of front  pay   if\r\n\nonly because  of its relatively speculative  nature, see Wildman,\r                                                                          \r\n\n771  F.2d at 616   is  necessarily less mechanical than back pay,\r\n\nand  the amount of front pay    if only because of its predictive\r\n\naspect   is necessarily less certain than back pay, see Hukkanen,\r                                                                          \r\n\n3 F.3d at 286.  For these reasons, front pay is much more heavily\r\n\ndependent than back pay upon the district court's exercise of its\r\n\ninformed  discretion.7    Consequently,  whether  or  not  courts\r\n\npossess  the  authority  to  tailor  back  pay  awards   to  take\r\n\ncollateral  benefits into account   a question that we leave open\r\n\nfor the  time  being    we are  confident that  they possess  the\r\n\nauthority to tailor awards of front pay in that manner.\r\n\n          2.

Hence, \"[t]he  Office of the Chancellor is\r\n\n. .  . to soften and  mollify the Extremity of  the Law .  . . .\"\r\n\nId.  Because the  hallmarks of equity have long  been flexibility\r             \r\n\nand  particularity, the imposition of  a rigid rule,  pro or con,\r\n\nconcerning the interrelationship between collateral  benefits and\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nfront  pay (an  equitable remedy) would  be incongruent  with the\r\n\nhistoric and essential conception of equity.  In contrast, a rule\r\n\nthat  confers latitude  upon  the district  court  to handle  the\r\n\ninterface  between collateral benefits  and front pay differently\r\n\nin  different  cases  is   fully  consistent  with  this  storied\r\n\nheritage.\r\n\n          For these reasons, we conclude that  the decision as to\r\n\nwhether  to tailor  a  front  pay  award  to  take  into  account\r\n\ncollateral  benefits  is,  and  must  be,  within  the  equitable\r\n\ndiscretion of the nisi prius court.\r                                      \r\n\n          On much the  same basis,  we do not  believe that  this\r\n\ndiscretion  is  rigidly  circumscribed   by  the  source  of  the\r                                                                  \r\n\ncollateral benefits.8   We  consider the  source of a  collateral\r\n\nbenefit to be informative, but not dispositive.   That is to say,\r\n\nbecause the  district court's decision about whether it should or\r\n\nshould  not tailor  a front  pay award  to dovetail  with certain\r\n\ncollateral benefits  is discretionary,  we think it  follows that\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8The parties attach great significance to the source of  the\r\nbenefits.   The Service argues that the collateral source rule is\r\npeculiarly inappropriate here because both  the front pay and the\r\ncollateral benefits emanate  from the same  source   the  federal\r\ngovernment.   Lussier  sees  no such  special  relationship.   He\r\nadvocates  that we  judge the  parcel not  by its  wrapping, but,\r\nrather,  by its contents, and asseverates that the post office is\r\nan independent entity distinct  from other federal agencies, such\r\nas the  Veterans  Administration.   In his  view, therefore,  the\r\nfront pay and the collateral benefits do not derive from the same\r\nsource, and there is  all the more reason to apply the collateral\r\nsource   rule  simpliciter.      Since   the   district   court's\r                                    \r\ndiscretionary decision in this case is sustainable without regard\r\nto the source  of the benefits,  we need not  decide the  precise\r\nrelationship between  the  post office  and  other parts  of  the\r\nfederal apparatus.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nthe defendant's status as  the source (or not) of  the collateral\r\n\nbenefit comprises, at  the most,  one factor of  many within  the\r\n\nmailbag of  discretionary considerations.  Here,  too, the nature\r\n\nand function of equity jurisprudence guide our reasoning.\r\n\n          To  be  sure, equity  is not  blind  to the  reality of\r\n\nevents.  The fact that the  payer of damages and the dispenser of\r\n\na  collateral benefit  are one  and the  same,  or that  they are\r\n\nlinked in some  economically meaningful sense, tends to  make the\r\n\ndeployment of  the collateral source  rule less attractive.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nSmith v.

See, e.g., Wyoming\r                                                                           \r\n\nRetirement Sys., 771 F.2d at 1431; Orzel, 697 F.2d at 756.\r                                                  \r\n\n          The district court's  decision is also  sufficiently in\r\n\nservice to the  first of the  two statutory objects:  deterrence.\r\n\nWhile  any consideration that holds down the amount of a monetary\r\n\njudgment  can  be said  to lessen  the  deterrent effect  of that\r\n\njudgment,  we believe that the relevant inquiry is broader in its\r\n\nscope.  Deterrence  is a function of  degree, and nothing in  the\r\n\nRehabilitation  Act  or  in the  case  law  commands  that it  be\r\n\nmaximized at  all costs.   This  practical wisdom has  particular\r\n\nforce where, as here,  maximizing deterrence might well interfere\r\n\nwith the measured achievement  of other statutory goals.10   Even\r\n\nshort  of  maximization,  the  statutory  purpose  can  be  fully\r\n\nsatisfied  so long as  deterrence is meaningfully  achieved.  Cf.\r                                                                           \r\n\nNavarro-Ayala  v.

After all, the basic\r\nfunction  of  a   front  pay   award  is  to   make  victims   of\r\ndiscrimination whole.

For  that reason,\r                                 \r\nan abuse of  discretion ordinarily  will not lie  when the  trial\r\ncourt, in the process of making the plaintiff whole   no more, no\r\nless   happens to produce a marginal diminution of deterrence.\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\nsanction aimed at deterrence is most appropriate \"when the amount\r\n\nof  the  sanction  falls  within  the  minimum  range  reasonably\r\n\nrequired   [effectively]  to   deter   the  abusive   behavior\");\r\n\nGraefenhain, 870 F.2d at 1213 &amp; n.9 (noting, in calculating front\r                     \r\n\npay, that a court's \"own vision of `optimal deterrence'\" is not a\r\n\nsufficient basis  \"to engraft additional remedies  on a statutory\r\n\nscheme  which is  predominantly compensatory\");  Enterprise Ass'n\r                                                                           \r\n\nSteamfitters, 542 F.2d  at 592 (finding \"no compelling  reason of\r                      \r\n\ndeterrence\" that would justify  \"providing the injured party with\r\n\ndouble  recovery   for  his  lost  employment\").     Here,  every\r\n\nindication  is that  the  district court's  award  of front  pay,\r\n\nhandsome eventhough diminished,packs an adequatedeterrent effect.\r\n\n          We add a  postscript:    viewing a  front pay award  in\r\n\nisolation for  the purpose  of measuring its  contribution toward\r\n\nthe  goals of an antidiscrimination statute is risky business.  A\r\n\nfront  pay award   like any other  single strand in a tapestry of\r\n\nrelief   must be assessed as a part of the entire remedial fabric\r\n\nthat the  trial court has fashioned  in a particular  case.  See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g., Barbano v.

This holistic principle takes into account\r\n\nthe  fact that the finding  of liability, in  addition to setting\r\n\nthe  stage  for  relief  and  thereby  furthering  the  goals  of\r\n\ncompensation   and   deterrence,   itself   sends    a   valuable\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\ninformational signal.   See, e.g.,  McKennon, 115 S.

In this\r\n\ninstance,  the  district  court  struck  an  entirely  reasonable\r\n\nbalance  between  the goals  of  fair  compensation and  adequate\r\n\ndeterrence.   Mindful  of  the breadth  of  the district  court's\r\n\ndiscretion in such matters, we affirm its decision to award front\r\n\npay to  the  plaintiff, but  to  tailor the  award to  take  into\r\n\naccount the collateral VA  benefits that he received as  a result\r\n\nof his unlawful discharge.11\r\n\nIII.

Because  the factfinder's choice between two  or more\r\npermissible  views  of  the  evidence cannot  be  deemed  clearly\r\nerroneous, see Cumpiano  v. Banco Santander  P.R., 902 F.2d  148,\r                                                           \r\n152  (1st Cir.  1990), we  reject this  complaint (which,  in any\r\nevent, is anchored in an overly optimistic reading of the record)\r\nout of hand.\r\n\n                                22\r\r\n\nextends  to  CSRS  benefits.12    Withal,  the  district  court's\r\n\nhandling of these benefits gives us pause.\r\n\n          During  the  trial,  reference  was made  to  Lussier's\r\n\neligibility  for  a  CSRS  disability retirement  annuity.    The\r\n\ngovernment advanced a rough estimate of the  monthly stipend that\r\n\nLussier  would  likely  receive.   Dissatisfied  with  the  trial\r\n\nevidence on this subject, the district court ordered \"the parties\r\n\nto file  within  30 days  a  status report  concerning  Lussier's\r\n\napplication for  CSRS disability benefits.\"   Lussier I,  1994 WL\r                                                                 \r\n\n129776, at  *11.   Lussier,  though objecting  vigorously to  the\r\n\ndirective, submitted  some  information anent  interim  payments.\r\n\nThe Service offered no assistance.  Eventually, the court reduced\r\n\nits  planned front pay award based on  the new information.  Both\r\n\nparties appeal.\r\n\n          Lussier  contends   that  the  entire   enterprise  was\r\n\nprocedurally infirm; that the Service failed  to prove the amount\r\n\nof any purported offset,  thus rendering the issue moot;  and, in\r\n\nall events, that the collateral  source rule should have operated\r\n\nto disqualify the CSRS  benefits from consideration in connection\r\n\nwith the front pay award.  For its part, the  Service asseverates\r\n\nthat the court erred in not  using the estimate of CSRS  benefits\r\n\nintroduced at trial,  or, alternatively, in not granting its Rule\r\n\n59(e)  motion and using  the more precise  figure limned therein.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12Lussier argues that CSRS benefits arise, at least in part,\r\nout  of employee  contributions,  and, therefore,  should not  be\r\ntreated  in the  same manner  as other  collateral benefits.   We\r\nexpress no opinion on this aspect of the matter.  Lussier can, of\r\ncourse, renew the argument before the district court on remand.\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\nSince  we   give  our  stamp  of  approval   to  Lussier's  first\r\n\ncontention, we need not address the parties' other points.\r\n\n          Typically, a district  court's decision  to reopen  the\r\n\nrecord for the purpose of receiving additional evidence engenders\r\n\nan  exercise of the  court's discretion, reviewable  for abuse of\r\n\nthat discretion.

We explain briefly.\r\n\n          It is a fundamental principle of our jurisprudence that\r\n\na factfinder  may not  consider extra-record  evidence concerning\r\n\ndisputed adjudicative facts.  A good illustration of this precept\r\n\nin operation can be found in the realm of judicial notice.  Under\r\n\nFed. R. Evid. 201(b), a judge may take notice of an  adjudicative\r\n\nfact only if it is \"not subject to reasonable dispute  in that it\r\n\nis either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction\r\n\nof  the  trial  court  or  (2)  capable  of  accurate  and  ready\r\n\ndetermination  by   resort  to  sources  whose   accuracy  cannot\r\n\nreasonably  be questioned.\"   Courts  have  tended to  apply Rule\r\n\n201(b) stringently   and well  they might, for accepting disputed\r\n\nevidence not tested in the crucible of trial is a sharp departure\r\n\nfrom  standard  practice.

Court records  aside,14  some\r\n\ngovernment documents are subject to judicial notice (albeit under\r\n\ncertain  limited  conditions)  on  the  ground  that  information\r\n\ncontained therein is \"capable of accurate and ready determination\r\n\nby  resort  to  sources   whose  accuracy  cannot  reasonably  be\r\n\nquestioned.\"  See, e.g., Massachusetts v.

The information here at\r\n\nissue  does not reach this safe harbor.   In the first place, the\r\n\ninformation  is not contained  in generally  available government\r\n\nrecords.  Second,  the court did not acquire  it by direct resort\r\n\nto any  public record,  but, rather, through  untested unilateral\r                \r\n\nsubmissions.   Third, a  monetary figure affecting  a plaintiff's\r\n\nultimate award, even though  eventually quantifiable, seems to us\r\n\nto  be the  sort  of disputed  adjudicative  fact for  which  the\r\n\nadversarial truth-finding process is  well suited.  And, finally,\r\n\nthe  court gave  the parties  no real  opportunity to  address or\r\n\ncounter the gleaned evidence.15\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     14Because  courts  may take  judicial  notice  of their  own\r\nrecords and the records  of sister tribunals under a  special set\r\nof rules,  see generally 21  Wright &amp;  Graham, supra,    5106, at\r                                                              \r\n256-57  (Supp.  1994),  we   exempt  court  documents  from  this\r\ndiscourse.\r\n\n     15Westcott forms  an  interesting  contrast  to  this  case.\r                         \r\nThere,  in  addition  to   the  qualitative  differences  in  the\r\ninformation  sought and in the  data source upon  which the court\r\nrelied, \"[t]he parties  were given an  opportunity to comment  on\r\nthe  propriety of [the Court's] taking notice of the license, and\r\nboth  sides agreed that [the  Court] could properly  do so.\"  433\r\nU.S. at 323 n.2.  Neither of these conditions obtains here.\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\n          Ours is a system  that seeks the discovery of  truth by\r\n\nmeans of a managed  adversarial relationship between the parties.\r\n\nIf we  were to allow  judges to bypass  this system, even  in the\r\n\ninterest of furthering efficiency or promoting  judicial economy,\r\n\nwe  would subvert this ultimate purpose.  As Rule 201(b) teaches,\r\n\njudges  may not  defenestrate established  evidentiary processes,\r\n\nthereby rendering  inoperative the  standard mechanisms of  proof\r\n\nand scrutiny, if the evidence in question is at all vulnerable to\r\n\nreasonable dispute.\r\n\n          Here,  the  district  court  failed to  steer  by  this\r\n\nbeacon.   There is  no indication,  despite the  court's contrary\r\n\ncharacterization,16  that the  record  was actually  reopened  or\r\n\nthat   the  parties  were  afforded  anything  approximating  the\r\n\nevidentiary  and  procedural  guarantees   to  which  they   were\r\n\nentitled.   Similarly,  there is  no basis  for finding  that the\r\n\nparties  waived  this  deprivation,   consented  to  the  court's\r\n\nshortcut, or  otherwise invited  judicial reliance on  the extra-\r\n\nrecord \"proof.\"  To the  extent that the judgment is  premised on\r\n\nthis late-arriving evidence, it cannot stand.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     16The  district court paid  lip service to  the principle we\r\nhave discussed, writing that  it had \"reopened the record.\"   But\r\nthe parties  agree that no actual reopening occurred, and calling\r\nwhat  the  court did  a \"reopening\"  does not  make  it so.   Cf.\r                                                                           \r\nSiegfriedt v. Fair, 982 F.2d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"With Juliet\r                            \r\nwe ask `What's in a name?' and with her we conclude `[t]hat which\r\nwe call  a  rose  by any  other  name would  smell  as  sweet.'\")\r\n(quoting William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet act 2, sc. 2).\r                                                        \r\n\n                                28\r\r\n\n          Accordingly, we  vacate the judgment and  remand.17  We\r\n\nneither dictate how  the district court should  proceed on remand\r\n\nnor  restrict  its  range  of  options.    For instance,  without\r\n\nlimiting  the generality of the  foregoing, the court  may in its\r\n\ndiscretion choose to reopen  the record fully for the  purpose of\r\n\nobtaining more information about Lussier's CSRS benefits, and, if\r\n\nthe court follows that path, it can then decide what, if any, use\r\n\nto make of the new evidence.  Alternatively, the court may, if it\r\n\nso elects, hold the parties to their proof at trial and determine\r\n\nthe front pay award on the existing record.\r\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\r          IV.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We have  reached the point  at which neither  snow, nor\r\n\nrain,  nor heat, nor gloom of night, nor any lingering unresolved\r\n\nissue impedes  the delivery of our judgment.  Thus, we need go no\r\n\nfurther.\r\n\n          We  hold that the adjustment of a front pay award under\r\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act  of 1973 to take collateral  benefits into\r\n\naccount is within the equitable discretion of the district court;\r\n\nand that,  in this case,  the court,  by choosing to  account for\r\n\ncollateral benefits  in fashioning such  an award, did  not abuse\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     17We neither  overlook  nor condone  the Service's  cavalier\r\ndisregard  of the  district judge's  request for  status reports.\r\nHad  the judge  scrapped the  proposed offset  as a  sanction for\r\nuncooperative behavior, a different issue would confront us.  Cf.\r                                                                           \r\nR.W.  Int'l Corp. v.

Here,  however, the judge  did not purpose  to\r\nsanction the Service  but instead decided a  hotly disputed issue\r\nin the case based partly on extra-record information.  As we have\r\nindicated  on other  occasions, even  when a  party is  guilty of\r\n\"lollygagging  that a district court should not have to tolerate,\r\ntwo wrongs seldom make a right.\"  Id. at 20.\r                                               \r\n\n                                29\r\r\n\nits  discretion.

Their  cross-appeals  pose  two  kinds  of\r\n\nquestions.   The  principal  inquiry  implicates  the  collateral\r\n\nsource  rule and requires us  to decide whether  a district court\r\n\nmay  tailor a  front  pay  award,  stemming  from  a  finding  of\r\n\ndisability discrimination under  the Rehabilitation Act of  1973,\r\n\nPub.  L.  No. 93-112,  87 Stat.  355 (codified  as amended  at 29\r\n\nU.S.C.     701-796i),  to  account for  an  increase in  Veterans\r\n\nAdministration (VA) benefits occasioned by the adverse employment\r\n\naction.   The  second inquiry  also touches  upon the  collateral\r\n\nsource rule, but turns on a determination of when, and under what\r\n\ncircumstances, a  district court, after the  parties have rested,\r\n\nmay  solicit and consider factual information germane to an issue\r\n\nin the case without formally reopening the record.\r\n\n          On the first issue, we hold that it is within the trial\r\n\ncourt's discretion to tailor a front pay award to take account of\r\n\ncollateral benefits in a discrimination case, and that  the court\r\n\nacted within the realm of this discretion in the case at bar.  On\r\n\nthe  second issue,  we hold  that  once the  record is  closed, a\r\n\ndistrict  court, absent  waiver  or consent,  ordinarily may  not\r\n\nreceive additional factual information  of a kind not susceptible\r\n\nto judicial  notice  unless  it  fully  reopens  the  record  and\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nanimates  the   panoply  of  evidentiary  rules   and  procedural\r\n\nsafeguards customarily  available to  litigants.  Finding,  as we\r\n\ndo, that the district court transgressed this rule, we cancel the\r\n\naward and stamp the matter \"returned to sender.\"\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Lussier  sued his  quondam employer in  Maine's federal\r\n\ndistrict court alleging, inter alia, that  his discharge from the\r                                             \r\n\nService on  March 4, 1992, amounted  to disability discrimination\r\n\nin violation of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29\r\n\nU.S.C.   791.1  A bench trial ensued.  Since  these appeals focus\r\n\nexclusively on the front pay award and  do not concern either the\r\n\nantecedent  question  of  liability  or the  propriety  of  other\r\n\nremedies, we discuss only  the evidence relating to the  form and\r\n\namount of front pay.\r\n\n          The plaintiff's expert, Dr. Allan McCausland, testified\r\n\nthat,  had Lussier not been fired, his future earnings and fringe\r\n\nbenefits  over a  projected  25-year work  expectancy would  have\r\n\naggregated  between  $790,805  and  $1,067,193  when  reduced  to\r\n\npresent  value.   The Service did  not directly  contradict these\r\n\nestimates,  but introduced  evidence that  Lussier's cloud  had a\r\n\nsmall  silver lining;  he had  been receiving  VA benefits  for a\r\n\nmilitary-service-related   disability,   and  the   circumstances\r\n\nsurrounding  his ouster  from  the post  office exacerbated  this\r\n\ndisability and triggered an increase in those benefits.  Moreover\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The named defendant is the Postmaster General, but, for all\r\nintents  and purposes, the Service is the real party in interest,\r\nand we treat it as such.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n  it  is said, after all,  that the postman always  rings twice  \r\n\nPatricia Asdourian, a Postal  Service human resources specialist,\r\n\ntestified  that  Lussier  would  also   be  receiving  disability\r\n\nbenefits through the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) as an\r\n\nincident of his discharge.  Lussier had applied for CSRS benefits\r\n\nonly a few weeks before trial and the precise  benefit level was,\r\n\ntherefore,   unknown.    Nonetheless,  Asdourian  predicted  that\r\n\nLussier's CSRS benefits would be in the neighborhood of $1185 per\r\n\nmonth.  The  Service argued that  the present value  of both  the\r\n\nincrease  in VA benefits (calculated to be $358,401) and the CSRS\r\n\ndisability payments should be deducted from any front pay.\r\n\n          On  November  9,  1993,  the  parties  rested  and  the\r\n\ndistrict court took the case under advisement.  In due course, it\r\n\nfound  that  the Service  had  discriminated  against Lussier  on\r\n\naccount of his  disability in violation of 29 U.S.C.    791.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nLussier v.

The court  made  an award  to the\r                                     \r\n\nplaintiff, see  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at *11, </span><pre class=\"inline\"> but declined to  order reinstatement\r                             \r\n\nbecause,  given  the sequelae  of  the firing,  Lussier  could no\r\n\nlonger  perform his accustomed duties.

It then compounded  its omission  by\r\n\nignoring the  court's instruction, issued on  April 21, directing\r\n\nit to respond  within ten days.  Judge  Hornby, unwilling to wait\r\n\nany longer, entered final judgment on May 24, 1994.  Based mainly\r\n\non  the lack of  any submission by the  Service, the judge seized\r\n\nupon  the figure of $390 per month, computed the present value of\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nthese monthly payments over Lussier's work expectancy ($112,723),\r\n\nand offset  this amount  against the  potential front  pay award.\r\n\nThe  court  thereupon  entered  a final  judgment  that  included\r\n\n$320,000  in  front pay  (representing  $790,805  in future  lost\r\n\nearnings, minus $358,401 in increased VA benefits, minus $112,723\r\n\nin CSRS benefits).\r\n\n          Three days later, the  Service moved to alter  or amend\r\n\nthe judgment,  Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), \"to reflect the fact that a\r\n\nfinal calculation of the plaintiff's [CSRS] disability retirement\r\n\nannuity  has  now  been  made,  resulting  in  a  monthly payment\r\n\neffective March 1, 1994, in the amount  of $1,111.\"  The district\r\n\ncourt denied the motion, writing that:\r\n\n          The defendant has already had more generosity\r\n          than it deserves from my initial reopening of\r\n          the trial record  and extensions  thereafter.\r\n          Although the plaintiff  may realize  somewhat\r\n          of  a \"windfall\"  as a  result, awarding  the\r\n          defendant relief would make a mockery of  all\r\n          judicial deadlines and the closing of a trial\r\n          record.\r\n\nBoth parties appeal.\r\n\nII.

COLLATERAL BENEFITS\r\n\n          These  appeals pose  an  important question:   In  what\r\n\nmanner,  if any,  does the  collateral source  rule    which bars\r\n\nresort to collateral benefits  in connection with the calculation\r\n\nof pecuniary damage awards, see 1 Dan B.

We respond  by  holding  that  insofar as  front  pay  is\r\n\nconcerned,  the  effect to  be  given  to collateral  benefits   \r\n\nwhatever their source   is within the equitable discretion of the\r\n\ndistrict  court.2  Applying this  general principle, we rule that\r\n\nthe  court below acted within the proper sphere of its discretion\r\n\nin  tailoring the  plaintiff's  front pay  award  to account  for\r\n\ncollateral  benefits received  by  the plaintiff  as a  traceable\r\n\nconsequence of the defendant's statutory violation.\r\n\n                    A.

In\r\n\nparticular,  the abstract  imposition  of  a black-or-white  rule\r\n\nregarding the relevance of collateral benefits, even if otherwise\r\n\ndesirable, would simply not  comport with the essential character\r\n\nand function of equitable discretion.

In contrast, a rule\r\n\nthat  confers latitude  upon  the district  court  to handle  the\r\n\ninterface  between collateral benefits  and front pay differently\r\n\nin  different  cases  is   fully  consistent  with  this  storied\r\n\nheritage.\r\n\n          For these reasons, we conclude that  the decision as to\r\n\nwhether  to tailor  a  front  pay  award  to  take  into  account\r\n\ncollateral  benefits  is,  and  must  be,  within  the  equitable\r\n\ndiscretion of the nisi prius court.\r                                      \r\n\n          On much the  same basis,  we do not  believe that  this\r\n\ndiscretion  is  rigidly  circumscribed   by  the  source  of  the\r                                                                  \r\n\ncollateral benefits.8   We  consider the  source of a  collateral\r\n\nbenefit to be informative, but not dispositive.   That is to say,\r\n\nbecause the  district court's decision about whether it should or\r\n\nshould  not tailor  a front  pay award  to dovetail  with certain\r\n\ncollateral benefits  is discretionary,  we think it  follows that\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8The parties attach great significance to the source of  the\r\nbenefits.   The Service argues that the collateral source rule is\r\npeculiarly inappropriate here because both  the front pay and the\r\ncollateral benefits emanate  from the same  source   the  federal\r\ngovernment.   Lussier  sees  no such  special  relationship.   He\r\nadvocates  that we  judge the  parcel not  by its  wrapping, but,\r\nrather,  by its contents, and asseverates that the post office is\r\nan independent entity distinct  from other federal agencies, such\r\nas the  Veterans  Administration.   In his  view, therefore,  the\r\nfront pay and the collateral benefits do not derive from the same\r\nsource, and there is  all the more reason to apply the collateral\r\nsource   rule  simpliciter.      Since   the   district   court's\r                                    \r\ndiscretionary decision in this case is sustainable without regard\r\nto the source  of the benefits,  we need not  decide the  precise\r\nrelationship between  the  post office  and  other parts  of  the\r\nfederal apparatus.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nthe defendant's status as  the source (or not) of  the collateral\r\n\nbenefit comprises, at  the most,  one factor of  many within  the\r\n\nmailbag of  discretionary considerations.  Here,  too, the nature\r\n\nand function of equity jurisprudence guide our reasoning.\r\n\n          To  be  sure, equity  is not  blind  to the  reality of\r\n\nevents.  The fact that the  payer of damages and the dispenser of\r\n\na  collateral benefit  are one  and the  same,  or that  they are\r\n\nlinked in some  economically meaningful sense, tends to  make the\r\n\ndeployment of  the collateral source  rule less attractive.

Lussier,  though objecting  vigorously to  the\r\n\ndirective, submitted  some  information anent  interim  payments.\r\n\nThe Service offered no assistance.  Eventually, the court reduced\r\n\nits  planned front pay award based on  the new information.  Both\r\n\nparties appeal.\r\n\n          Lussier  contends   that  the  entire   enterprise  was\r\n\nprocedurally infirm; that the Service failed  to prove the amount\r\n\nof any purported offset,  thus rendering the issue moot;  and, in\r\n\nall events, that the collateral  source rule should have operated\r\n\nto disqualify the CSRS  benefits from consideration in connection\r\n\nwith the front pay award.  For its part, the  Service asseverates\r\n\nthat the court erred in not  using the estimate of CSRS  benefits\r\n\nintroduced at trial,  or, alternatively, in not granting its Rule\r\n\n59(e)  motion and using  the more precise  figure limned therein.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12Lussier argues that CSRS benefits arise, at least in part,\r\nout  of employee  contributions,  and, therefore,  should not  be\r\ntreated  in the  same manner  as other  collateral benefits.   We\r\nexpress no opinion on this aspect of the matter.  Lussier can, of\r\ncourse, renew the argument before the district court on remand.\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\nSince  we   give  our  stamp  of  approval   to  Lussier's  first\r\n\ncontention, we need not address the parties' other points.\r\n\n          Typically, a district  court's decision  to reopen  the\r\n\nrecord for the purpose of receiving additional evidence engenders\r\n\nan  exercise of the  court's discretion, reviewable  for abuse of\r\n\nthat discretion.

We explain briefly.\r\n\n          It is a fundamental principle of our jurisprudence that\r\n\na factfinder  may not  consider extra-record  evidence concerning\r\n\ndisputed adjudicative facts.  A good illustration of this precept\r\n\nin operation can be found in the realm of judicial notice.  Under\r\n\nFed. R. Evid. 201(b), a judge may take notice of an  adjudicative\r\n\nfact only if it is \"not subject to reasonable dispute  in that it\r\n\nis either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction\r\n\nof  the  trial  court  or  (2)  capable  of  accurate  and  ready\r\n\ndetermination  by   resort  to  sources  whose   accuracy  cannot\r\n\nreasonably  be questioned.\"   Courts  have  tended to  apply Rule\r\n\n201(b) stringently   and well  they might, for accepting disputed\r\n\nevidence not tested in the crucible of trial is a sharp departure\r\n\nfrom  standard  practice.

As Rule 201(b) teaches,\r\n\njudges  may not  defenestrate established  evidentiary processes,\r\n\nthereby rendering  inoperative the  standard mechanisms of  proof\r\n\nand scrutiny, if the evidence in question is at all vulnerable to\r\n\nreasonable dispute.\r\n\n          Here,  the  district  court  failed to  steer  by  this\r\n\nbeacon.

Similarly,  there is  no basis  for finding  that the\r\n\nparties  waived  this  deprivation,   consented  to  the  court's\r\n\nshortcut, or  otherwise invited  judicial reliance on  the extra-\r\n\nrecord \"proof.\"  To the  extent that the judgment is  premised on\r\n\nthis late-arriving evidence, it cannot stand.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     16The  district court paid  lip service to  the principle we\r\nhave discussed, writing that  it had \"reopened the record.\"   But\r\nthe parties  agree that no actual reopening occurred, and calling\r\nwhat  the  court did  a \"reopening\"  does not  make  it so.
