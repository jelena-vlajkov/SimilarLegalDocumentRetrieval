The  remaining two  panelists therefore  issue this  opinion\npursuant to 28 U.S.C.   46(d).\n\n           Per Curiam.   In this appeal,  defendant-appellant\n                     \n\nPascual Casiano challenges his convictions for conspiracy, 18\n\nU.S.C.    371,  aiding  and abetting  an attempted  extortion\n\nunder  color of  official  right, 18  U.S.C.     2  and  1951\n\n(hereinafter   \"the  Hobbs  Act   violation\"),  making  false\n\nstatements to a grand jury, 18 U.S.C.   1623, and obstruction\n\nof justice, 18  U.S.C.   1503.   After carefully  considering\n\nCasiano's appellate arguments, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          The  facts of this case need not be stated in great\n\ndetail.    Casiano  was a  used  car  salesman  who lived  in\n\nDorchester,  Massachusetts.    Casiano's codefendant,  Daniel\n\nSheehan, was an  employee of the City  of Boston Inspectional\n\nServices  Department  (\"BISD\"),   which  is  responsible  for\n\nissuing towing  and building occupancy permits.   Sheehan had\n\nparticular expertise  as  a member  of the  \"auto team\"  that\n\nissues licenses  relating to  towing businesses and  used car\n\nsales in the City of Boston.\n\n          The evidence  adduced  at trial  established  that,\n\nover  a number  of  years, Casiano  brought  people who  were\n\nseeking  assistance  with the  City's  permitting  process to\n\nSheehan, and that Sheehan used his position with BISD to help\n\nthem.   There was, however, a catch; Sheehan's \"help\" did not\n\ncome free.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n          Although the prosecution's case encompassed several\n\nincidents  in which  Casiano  brought people  to Sheehan  for\n\nassistance, it  centered on Casiano's  and Sheehan's  actions\n\nwith regard to one Jose Arocho in 1991 and 1992.   Throughout\n\n1991, Arocho was having trouble obtaining a used car dealer's\n\nlicense  from BISD for his business at 25 West Cottage Street\n\nin  Dorchester.    During  this  same  time  period,  Casiano\n\nrepeatedly approached Arocho and informed  him that he had  a\n\nfriend  at BISD who, if paid, would solve his permit problem.\n\nAt first, Casiano indicated that the  problem could be solved\n\nfor $5,000.   Later, the price  was set at $10,000.   Arocho,\n\nhowever, refused to make any illegal payments.\n\n          Finally, on September 5,  1991 (and after months of\n\nbadgering by  Casiano), Arocho  met with Casiano  and Sheehan\n\nabout his  continuing problems.  Fearing  a shakedown, Arocho\n\nsurreptitiously taped  the meeting.  At  the meeting, Sheehan\n\nand Casiano explicitly stated that  Sheehan might be able  to\n\nhelp  Arocho, but  that  Sheehan's help  would cost  $15,000.\n\nArocho  did not  agree to  pay, but  kept the  door  open for\n\nadditional meetings.  Subsequently,  Arocho contacted the FBI\n\nand, with its assistance, attempted  to tape and actually did\n\ntape  several  additional   conversations  between   himself,\n\nCasiano, and Sheehan.\n\n          In June 1992, Casiano and Sheehan appeared before a\n\nfederal grand jury  and falsely testified  that they had  not\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nattempted to extort illegal payments from  Arocho.  They also\n\nfalsely testified that the $15,000 payment was Arocho's idea.\n\nIn  December   1992,  the  grand  jury   issued  a  six-count\n\nindictment charging Casiano and Sheehan with the crimes noted\n\nin the first  paragraph of  this opinion.   After a  five-day\n\njury trial, Casiano and Sheehan were convicted on all counts.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          On appeal, Casiano makes  two arguments.  First, he\n\ncontends  that  he was  denied  his  right  to the  effective\n\nassistance of counsel.  Second, he argues that his conviction\n\nfor violating  the Hobbs Act must be set aside because he was\n\nnot  acting or  purporting to  act \"under  color of  official\n\nright.\"    See  18 U.S.C.     1951(b)(2).    We discuss  each\n              \n\nargument in turn.\n\nA.  Right to Effective Counsel\n                              \n\n          Casiano's right to  effective assistance of counsel\n\nargument  arises out  of  an unfortunate  episode which  took\n\nplace in the course  of the government's cross-examination of\n\nSheehan, who had taken  the stand in his own  defense.  About\n\nhalfway  through  this  cross-examination,   Casiano's  trial\n\ncounsel  objected to a question posed by the prosecutor.  The\n\ntrial court  overruled the objection,  informing counsel,  in\n\neffect,  that he could not object because the witness was not\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nhis client.  The prosecutor then posed the same question, and\n\nCasiano's  counsel again  objected.   In response,  the court\n\ntold  counsel to  sit down  and dismissed  the jury  from the\n\ncourtroom.   At this point, the court  again informed counsel\n\nthat  he could  not object  because the  witness was  not his\n\nclient.   The jury returned and  cross-examination continued.\n\nDuring  the next  several  minutes,  Casiano's trial  counsel\n\ninterposed  several  more  objections,  each   of  which  was\n\nsummarily overruled.\n\n          Eventually, the  court ordered a  short recess  and\n\nagain  dismissed the jury from the courtroom.  At this point,\n\nthe court  informed Casiano's  trial counsel  that he  was in\n\ncontempt of  court for disregarding the court's  order not to\n\nobject during the government's  cross-examination.  After the\n\njury  returned, Casiano's  counsel  remained largely  silent1\n\nfor  the rest  of the  cross-examination.   Subsequently, the\n\ncourt sanctioned him.\n\n          As an  initial matter, we note that the record does\n\nnot reflect  that the trial court  restricted Casiano's right\n\nto object  out  of concern  that  the objections  were  being\n\ninterposed  for an  improper  purpose such  as harassment  or\n\ndelay.    Instead, it  appears  that the  court  premised its\n\n                    \n\n1.  At one point, Casiano's counsel exclaimed, \"Oh, wait a --\n\"  in  response  to  a  question  posed  by  the  prosecutor.\nSheehan's  trial counsel also objected to this question.  The\ntrial court sustained the objection.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nrestriction  upon a view that  counsel had no  legal right to\n\nobject  because the witness was  not his client.   We cannot,\n\nhowever,  locate any  authority  which supports  this ruling.\n\nMoreover,  we  see no  purpose for  such  a rule;  after all,\n\nSheehan's   testimony,   which   covered   aspects   of   his\n\nrelationship  with  Casiano,  certainly implicated  Casiano's\n\ninterests.  Accordingly, we will proceed under the assumption\n\nthat the court's restriction was improper.\n\n          Casiano's right to effective assistance argument is\n\nframed  in two separate ways.  First, Casiano claims that the\n\ntrial  court's actions rendered  his counsel constitutionally\n\n\"ineffective\"  from  the  time   he  was  sanctioned  to  the\n\nconclusion  of the government's cross-examination of Sheehan.\n\nIn the  alternative, Casiano argues that  the court's actions\n\ncompletely  deprived him of the right  to counsel during this\n\nsame period.\n\n          Ordinarily,   we   do   not   address   ineffective\n\nassistance  claims  raised  for  the first  time2  on  direct\n\nappeal.  E.g., United States v. Jadusingh, 12 F.3d 1162, 1169\n                                         \n\n(1st Cir. 1994).  In situations like this one, however, where\n\nthere is no dispute over the critical facts and the record is\n\nsufficiently developed, we  may exercise  our discretion  and\n\nreach the  merits  of a  newly-raised ineffective  assistance\n\n                    \n\n2.  The record  does not indicate that  Casiano presented his\nineffective  assistance claim  to the  district court  in the\nfirst instance.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nargument.   See, e.g., United States v. Fermin Ortiz, No. 93-\n                                                    \n\n1359, slip op. at 11-12 (1st Cir. May 5, 1994).\n\n          To    demonstrate   constitutionally    ineffective\n\nassistance of  counsel, a  defendant must establish  that (1)\n\ncounsel's  conduct  fell  below the  applicable  standard for\n\nperformance,  defined by what s/he knew  or should have known\n\nat  the time s/he made the relevant tactical choices; and (2)\n\nthat  prejudice  resulted.   Id. at  12.   \"In  this context,\n                                \n\n`prejudice'  means  that,  but for  counsel's  unprofessional\n\nerror, there is a  reasonable probability that the  result of\n\nthe proceedings  would have  been different.\"   Id. (applying\n                                                   \n\nthe standard set forth in  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n668, 687 (1984)).\n\n          Leaving aside the obvious difficulties  in applying\n\nthe  Strickland  standard   in  a  context  where   counsel's\n               \n\ncomplained-of  tactical choices were  imposed by court order,\n\nwe conclude that Casiano's ineffective assistance claim  must\n\nfail for a  lack of prejudice.  Casiano  does not explain how\n\nthere is a reasonable  probability that the proceedings would\n\nhave turned out  differently if his counsel had  been allowed\n\nto  object during  that  portion of  the government's  cross-\n\nexamination in  which he  was effectively silenced.   Indeed,\n\nCasiano does not even point to any one question which, in his\n\nview, was improper.  Moreover, our independent review  of the\n\nrecord convinces us  beyond any doubt whatsoever that, if any\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nimproper question was  posed during this  period, it did  not\n\nalter the outcome of the trial.\n\n          Casiano's  deprivation  of  the  right  to  counsel\n\nargument  differs  from his  ineffective  assistance argument\n\nbecause, \"when  a defendant is  deprived of the  presence and\n\nassistance of his attorney, either throughout the prosecution\n\nor during a critical stage in, at least, the prosecution of a\n\ncapital  offense,  reversal  is  automatic.\"     Holloway  v.\n                                                         \n\nArkansas,  435  U.S. 475,  489 (1978).    The Court  has been\n        \n\nclear, however,  that application of  the harmless-error rule\n\nis  appropriate where the deprivation of the right to counsel\n\nis limited and does not infect an entire, noncapital criminal\n\nproceeding such as this  one.  See Satterwhite v.  Texas, 486\n                                                        \n\nU.S.  249, 257-58  (1988).   We  think  that the  restriction\n\nimposed by the trial court here, even if properly viewed as a\n\ndeprivation  of the right to counsel, was so limited in scope\n\nand effect that an  application of harmless-error analysis is\n\nappropriate.  See  id.  And, as we  indicated above, we think\n                      \n\nit beyond any reasonable  doubt that the error  committed did\n\nnot contribute  to  the verdict  obtained.   See  Chapman  v.\n                                                         \n\nCalifornia, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967).\n          \n\n          Accordingly,  we reject Casiano's argument that the\n\nrestriction  imposed  upon  his  trial  counsel   during  the\n\ngovernment's  cross-examination  requires  reversal   of  his\n\nconvictions.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nB.  Hobbs Act Violation\n                       \n\n          Casiano's  second argument  is that  his conviction\n\nunder  the Hobbs  Act for  aiding and  abetting an  attempted\n\nextortion was  improper because he was not  a public official\n\nand  therefore could  not have  been acting  \"under color  of\n\nofficial   right.\"     18  U.S.C.      1951(b)(2)   (defining\n\n\"extortion\" as,  inter alia, \"the obtaining  of property from\n                           \n\nanother,  with  his consent,  induced .  .  . under  color of\n\nofficial right\").  Because Casiano did not make this argument\n\nbelow,  our  review  is  limited  to whether  his  Hobbs  Act\n\nconviction was  plainly  erroneous.   See  Fed. R.  Crim.  P.\n                                         \n\n52(b).\n\n          We discern  no error at all in this case.  First of\n\nall,  one need not be an elected or appointed public official\n\neven to be  convicted as  a principal under  the Hobbs  Act's\n                                     \n\n\"color of official  right\" provision.   See United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nFreeman,  6 F.3d 586,  593 (9th Cir.  1993) (collecting cases\n       \n\nwhere  nonelected,  nonappointed  government  employees  were\n\nconvicted of  official right extortion under  the Hobbs Act),\n\ncert. denied, 62  U.S.L.W. 3722 (May 2, 1994)  (No. 93-8558).\n            \n\nHere,  however,  Casiano was  convicted  only  of aiding  and\n                                                             \n\nabetting  an  attempted  extortion  under color  of  official\n        \n\nright.   In  order to  have been  so convicted,  the evidence\n\nmerely  had to  support a  conclusion that  Casiano \"aid[ed],\n\nabet[ted],    counsel[ed],    command[ed],   induce[d],    or\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nprocure[d]\" an attempted  extortion under  color of  official\n\nright.   See 18 U.S.C.    2(a).  Certainly,  the evidence was\n            \n\nsufficient  for  the jury  to  have  found that  Casiano  and\n\nSheehan aided each  other and that  they attempted to  extort\n\nmoney  from Arocho.  And, Casiano does not and cannot dispute\n\nthat  Sheehan   acted  under  color  of   official  right  in\n\nwrongfully using his position with BISD in the course of this\n\nattempted  extortion.

Sec. 371, aiding and abetting an attempted extortion under color of official right, 18 U.S.C. Secs. 2 and 1951 (hereinafter \"the Hobbs Act violation\"), making false statements to a grand jury, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  1623, and obstruction of justice, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1503.  After carefully considering Casiano's appellate arguments, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case need not be stated in great detail.  Casiano was a used car salesman who lived in Dorchester, Massachusetts.  Casiano's codefendant, Daniel Sheehan, was an employee of the City of Boston Inspectional Services Department (\"BISD\"), which is responsible for issuing towing and building occupancy permits.  Sheehan had particular expertise as a member of the \"auto team\" that issues licenses relating to towing businesses and used car sales in the City of Boston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence adduced at trial established that, over a number of years, Casiano brought people who were seeking assistance with the City's permitting process to Sheehan, and that Sheehan used his position with BISD to help them.  There was, however, a catch;  Sheehan's \"help\" did not come free.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the prosecution's case encompassed several incidents in which Casiano brought people to Sheehan for assistance, it centered on Casiano's and Sheehan's actions with regard to one Jose Arocho in 1991 and 1992.  Throughout 1991, Arocho was having trouble obtaining a used car dealer's license from BISD for his business at 25 West Cottage Street in Dorchester.  During this same time period, Casiano repeatedly approached Arocho and informed him that he had a friend at BISD who, if paid, would solve his permit problem.  At first, Casiano indicated that the problem could be solved for $5,000.  Later, the price was set at $10,000.  Arocho, however, refused to make any illegal payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, on September 5, 1991 (and after months of badgering by Casiano), Arocho met with Casiano and Sheehan about his continuing problems.  Fearing a shakedown, Arocho surreptitiously taped the meeting.  At the meeting, Sheehan and Casiano explicitly stated that Sheehan might be able to help Arocho, but that Sheehan's help would cost $15,000.  Arocho did not agree to pay, but kept the door open for additional meetings.  Subsequently, Arocho contacted the FBI and, with its assistance, attempted to tape and actually did tape several additional conversations between himself, Casiano, and Sheehan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1992, Casiano and Sheehan appeared before a federal grand jury and falsely testified that they had not attempted to extort illegal payments from Arocho.  They also falsely testified that the $15,000 payment was Arocho's idea.  In December 1992, the grand jury issued a six-count indictment charging Casiano and Sheehan with the crimes noted in the first paragraph of this opinion.  After a five-day jury trial, Casiano and Sheehan were convicted on all counts.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Casiano makes two arguments.  First, he contends that he was denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel.  Second, he argues that his conviction for violating the Hobbs Act must be set aside because he was not acting or purporting to act \"under color of official right.\"  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1951(b)(2).  We discuss each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Right to Effective Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casiano's right to effective assistance of counsel argument arises out of an unfortunate episode which took place in the course of the government's cross-examination of Sheehan, who had taken the stand in his own defense.  About halfway through this cross-examination, Casiano's trial counsel objected to a question posed by the prosecutor.  The trial court overruled the objection, informing counsel, in effect, that he could not object because the witness was not his client.  The prosecutor then posed the same question, and Casiano's counsel again objected.  In response, the court told counsel to sit down and dismissed the jury from the courtroom.  At this point, the court again informed counsel that he could not object because the witness was not his client.  The jury returned and cross-examination continued.  During the next several minutes, Casiano's trial counsel interposed several more objections, each of which was summarily overruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, the court ordered a short recess and again dismissed the jury from the courtroom.  At this point, the court informed Casiano's trial counsel that he was in contempt of court for disregarding the court's order not to object during the government's cross-examination.  After the jury returned, Casiano's counsel remained largely silent<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> for the rest of the cross-examination.  Subsequently, the court sanctioned him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, we note that the record does not reflect that the trial court restricted Casiano's right to object out of concern that the objections were being interposed for an improper purpose such as harassment or delay.  Instead, it appears that the court premised its restriction upon a view that counsel had no legal right to object because the witness was not his client.  We cannot, however, locate any authority which supports this ruling.  Moreover, we see no purpose for such a rule;  after all, Sheehan's testimony, which covered aspects of his relationship with Casiano, certainly implicated Casiano's interests.  Accordingly, we will proceed under the assumption that the court's restriction was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casiano's right to effective assistance argument is framed in two separate ways.  First, Casiano claims that the trial court's actions rendered his counsel constitutionally \"ineffective\" from the time he was sanctioned to the conclusion of the government's cross-examination of Sheehan.  In the alternative, Casiano argues that the court's actions completely deprived him of the right to counsel during this same period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, we do not address ineffective assistance claims raised for the first time<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> on direct appeal.   E.g., United States v. Jadusingh, 12 F.3d 1162, 1169 (1st Cir. 1994).  In situations like this one, however, where there is no dispute over the critical facts and the record is sufficiently developed, we may exercise our discretion and reach the merits of a newly-raised ineffective assistance argument.  See, e.g., United States v. Fermin Ortiz, No. 93-1359, slip op. at 11-12 (1st Cir.  May 5, 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To demonstrate constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must establish that (1) counsel's conduct fell below the applicable standard for performance, defined by what s/he knew or should have known at the time s/he made the relevant tactical choices;  and (2) that prejudice resulted.  Id. at 12.  \"In this context, 'prejudice' means that, but for counsel's unprofessional error, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different.\"  Id. (applying the standard set forth in  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leaving aside the obvious difficulties in applying the Strickland standard in a context where counsel's complained-of tactical choices were imposed by court order, we conclude that Casiano's ineffective assistance claim must fail for a lack of prejudice.  Casiano does not explain how there is a reasonable probability that the proceedings would have turned out differently if his counsel had been allowed to object during that portion of the government's cross-examination in which he was effectively silenced.  Indeed, Casiano does not even point to any one question which, in his view, was improper.  Moreover, our independent review of the record convinces us beyond any doubt whatsoever that, if any improper question was posed during this period, it did not alter the outcome of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casiano's deprivation of the right to counsel argument differs from his ineffective assistance argument because, \"when a defendant is deprived of the presence and assistance of his attorney, either throughout the prosecution or during a critical stage in, at least, the prosecution of a capital offense, reversal is automatic.\"   Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475, 489 (1978).  The Court has been clear, however, that application of the harmless-error rule is appropriate where the deprivation of the right to counsel is limited and does not infect an entire, noncapital criminal proceeding such as this one.   See Satterwhite v. Texas, 486 U.S. 249, 257-58 (1988).  We think that the restriction imposed by the trial court here, even if properly viewed as a deprivation of the right to counsel, was so limited in scope and effect that an application of harmless-error analysis is appropriate.  See id.  And, as we indicated above, we think it beyond any reasonable doubt that the error committed did not contribute to the verdict obtained.   See Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject Casiano's argument that the restriction imposed upon his trial counsel during the government's cross-examination requires reversal of his convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Hobbs Act Violation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casiano's second argument is that his conviction under the Hobbs Act for aiding and abetting an attempted extortion was improper because he was not a public official and therefore could not have been acting \"under color of official right.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 1951(b)(2) (defining \"extortion\" as, inter alia, \"the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced ... under color of official right\").  Because Casiano did not make this argument below, our review is limited to whether his Hobbs Act conviction was plainly erroneous.  See Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 52(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no error at all in this case.  First of all, one need not be an elected or appointed public official even to be convicted as a principal under the Hobbs Act's \"color of official right\" provision.  See United States v.  Freeman, 6 F.3d 586, 593 (9th Cir. 1993) (collecting cases where nonelected, nonappointed government employees were convicted of official right extortion under the Hobbs Act), cert. denied, 62 U.S.L.W. 3722 (May 2, 1994) (No. 93-8558).  Here, however, Casiano was convicted only of aiding and abetting an attempted extortion under color of official right.  In order to have been so convicted, the evidence merely had to support a conclusion that Casiano \"aid[ed], abet[ted], counsel[ed], command[ed], induce[d], or procure[d]\" an attempted extortion under color of official right.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2(a).  Certainly, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to have found that Casiano and Sheehan aided each other and that they attempted to extort money from Arocho.  And, Casiano does not and cannot dispute that Sheehan acted under color of official right in wrongfully using his position with BISD in the course of this attempted extortion.   See Freeman, 6 F.3d at 593 (\"We conclude that the Hobbs Act reaches anyone who actually exercises official powers, regardless of whether those powers were conferred by election, appointment, or some other method.\").  Thus, because Casiano's conduct clearly fell within the relevant statutory language, his conviction must stand.   See United States v. Culbert, 435 U.S. 371, 380 (1978) (\"[T]he statutory language and legislative history of the Hobbs Act impels us to the conclusion that Congress intended to make criminal all conduct within the reach of the statutory language.\");   see also, e.g., United States v. Spitler, 800 F.2d 1267, 1278 (4th Cir. 1986) (affirming conviction of non-public official who aided and abetted an extortion under color of official right).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject Casiano's assertion that his conduct plainly was outside the reach of the Hobbs Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having rejected defendant's appellate arguments, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Western District of Washington, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Chief Judge Stephen Breyer heard oral argument in this matter but did not participate in the drafting or the issuance of the panel's opinion.

First, he contends that he was denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel.  Second, he argues that his conviction for violating the Hobbs Act must be set aside because he was not acting or purporting to act \"under color of official right.\"  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1951(b)(2).

Subsequently, the court sanctioned him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, we note that the record does not reflect that the trial court restricted Casiano's right to object out of concern that the objections were being interposed for an improper purpose such as harassment or delay.  Instead, it appears that the court premised its restriction upon a view that counsel had no legal right to object because the witness was not his client.  We cannot, however, locate any authority which supports this ruling.  Moreover, we see no purpose for such a rule;  after all, Sheehan's testimony, which covered aspects of his relationship with Casiano, certainly implicated Casiano's interests.  Accordingly, we will proceed under the assumption that the court's restriction was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casiano's right to effective assistance argument is framed in two separate ways.  First, Casiano claims that the trial court's actions rendered his counsel constitutionally \"ineffective\" from the time he was sanctioned to the conclusion of the government's cross-examination of Sheehan.  In the alternative, Casiano argues that the court's actions completely deprived him of the right to counsel during this same period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, we do not address ineffective assistance claims raised for the first time<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> on direct appeal.   E.g., United States v. Jadusingh, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195129\"><a href=\"/opinion/195129/united-states-v-jadusingh/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1162</span></a></span>, 1169 (1st Cir. 1994).  In situations like this one, however, where there is no dispute over the critical facts and the record is sufficiently developed, we may exercise our discretion and reach the merits of a newly-raised ineffective assistance argument.  See, e.g., United States v. Fermin Ortiz, No. 93-1359, slip op. at 11-12 (1st Cir.  May 5, 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To demonstrate constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must establish that (1) counsel's conduct fell below the applicable standard for performance, defined by what s/he knew or should have known at the time s/he made the relevant tactical choices;  and (2) that prejudice resulted.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195129\"><a href=\"/opinion/195129/united-states-v-jadusingh/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 12. </a></span> \"In this context, 'prejudice' means that, but for counsel's unprofessional error, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195129\"><a href=\"/opinion/195129/united-states-v-jadusingh/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (applying the </a></span>standard set forth in  Strickland v. Washington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 687 (1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leaving aside the obvious difficulties in applying the Strickland standard in a context where counsel's complained-of tactical choices were imposed by court order, we conclude that Casiano's ineffective assistance claim must fail for a lack of prejudice.  Casiano does not explain how there is a reasonable probability that the proceedings would have turned out differently if his counsel had been allowed to object during that portion of the government's cross-examination in which he was effectively silenced.  Indeed, Casiano does not even point to any one question which, in his view, was improper.  Moreover, our independent review of the record convinces us beyond any doubt whatsoever that, if any improper question was posed during this period, it did not alter the outcome of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casiano's deprivation of the right to counsel argument differs from his ineffective assistance argument because, \"when a defendant is deprived of the presence and assistance of his attorney, either throughout the prosecution or during a critical stage in, at least, the prosecution of a capital offense, reversal is automatic.\"   Holloway v. Arkansas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109825\"><a href=\"/opinion/109825/holloway-v-arkansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span>, 489 (1978).  The Court has been clear, however, that application of the harmless-error rule is appropriate where the deprivation of the right to counsel is limited and does not infect an entire, noncapital criminal proceeding such as this one.   See Satterwhite v. Texas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112080\"><a href=\"/opinion/112080/satterwhite-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span>, 257-58 (1988).  We think that the restriction imposed by the trial court here, even if properly viewed as a deprivation of the right to counsel, was so limited in scope and effect that an application of harmless-error analysis is appropriate.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112080\"><a href=\"/opinion/112080/satterwhite-v-texas/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  And, as </a></span>we indicated above, we think it beyond any reasonable doubt that the error committed did not contribute to the verdict obtained.   See Chapman v. California, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107359\"><a href=\"/opinion/107359/chapman-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 24 (1967).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject Casiano's argument that the restriction imposed upon his trial counsel during the government's cross-examination requires reversal of his convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Hobbs Act Violation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casiano's second argument is that his conviction under the Hobbs Act for aiding and abetting an attempted extortion was improper because he was not a public official and therefore could not have been acting \"under color of official right.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 1951(b)(2) (defining \"extortion\" as, inter alia, \"the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced ... under color of official right\").  Because Casiano did not make this argument below, our review is limited to whether his Hobbs Act conviction was plainly erroneous.  See Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 52(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no error at all in this case.  First of all, one need not be an elected or appointed public official even to be convicted as a principal under the Hobbs Act's \"color of official right\" provision.  See United States v.  Freeman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654260\"><a href=\"/opinion/654260/united-states-v-darryl-freeman-tyrone-netters/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 593 (9th Cir. 1993) (collecting cases where nonelected, nonappointed government employees were convicted of official right extortion under the Hobbs Act), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.L.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">3722</span> </span>(May 2, 1994) (No. 93-8558).  Here, however, Casiano was convicted only of aiding and abetting an attempted extortion under color of official right.  In order to have been so convicted, the evidence merely had to support a conclusion that Casiano \"aid[ed], abet[ted], counsel[ed], command[ed], induce[d], or procure[d]\" an attempted extortion under color of official right.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2(a).  Certainly, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to have found that Casiano and Sheehan aided each other and that they attempted to extort money from Arocho.  And, Casiano does not and cannot dispute that Sheehan acted under color of official right in wrongfully using his position with BISD in the course of this attempted extortion.   See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654260\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Freeman,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/654260/united-states-v-darryl-freeman-tyrone-netters/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">593</span> </a></span>(\"We conclude that the Hobbs Act reaches anyone who actually exercises official powers, regardless of whether those powers were conferred by election, appointment, or some other method.\").  Thus, because Casiano's conduct clearly fell within the relevant statutory language, his conviction must stand.   See United States v. Culbert, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109821\"><a href=\"/opinion/109821/united-states-v-culbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 380 (1978) (\"[T]he statutory language and legislative history of the Hobbs Act impels us to the conclusion that Congress intended to make criminal all conduct within the reach of the statutory language.\");   see also, e.g., United States v. Spitler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"476278\"><a href=\"/opinion/476278/united-states-v-russell-e-spitler-united-states-of-america-v-duane/\"><span class=\"volume\">800</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></a></span>, 1278 (4th Cir. 1986) (affirming conviction of non-public official who aided and abetted an extortion under color of official right).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject Casiano's assertion that his conduct plainly was outside the reach of the Hobbs Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having rejected defendant's appellate arguments, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Western District of Washington, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Chief Judge Stephen Breyer heard oral argument in this matter but did not participate in the drafting or the issuance of the panel's opinion.
