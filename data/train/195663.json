(\"Falconer  Lewiston\")  and  Guardian Industries\n\nCorp. (\"Guardian\")  on JRS's claims  for breach of  contract, and\n\nJRS appeals the district court's denial of its motion to alter or\n\namend the judgment.  We affirm.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          On November  2, 1990, subcontractor JRS  entered into a\n\nsubcontract with contractor G.R.G. Engineering, S.E.  (\"GRG\"), to\n\nreplace the windows at  Building 31 at the Roosevelt  Roads Naval\n\nBase in Ceiba, Puerto  Rico.  GRG was the Navy's prime contractor\n\nfor this project.\n\n          The prime  contract between the Navy  and GRG contained\n\nvarious  specifications  for the  new  window glass.    Among the\n\nspecifications were  the requirements that the  glass provide 39%\n\nvisible   light   transmission   and  .005%   ultraviolet   light\n\ntransmission.        Paragraph   1.3   of   the  prime   contract\n\nspecifications provided that the glass was to be delivered to the\n\nsite in unopened containers, stored in a safe, dry place, and was\n\nnot to be unpacked until needed for installation.\n\n          JRS  ordered the  glass for  the project  from Falconer\n\nGlass pursuant to a  purchase order dated November 16, 1990.  The\n\nglass was packed and  shipped by Falconer Lewiston.   Guardian is\n\nalleged to be the successor in interest to Falconer Glass.\n\n                               -2-\n\n          The glass was delivered to JRS in or about April, 1991.\n\nJRS stored the glass in  its warehouse.  JRS did not  inspect the\n\nglass until February  of 1992,  when it began  installation.   In\n\nFebruary 1992, JRS  noticed defects  in the glass.   Glass  panes\n\nwhich had recently been  installed were stained with rainbow-like\n\nmarks, which resulted in  an iridescent effect on their  surface.\n\nThe staining did  not show when  the glass was  taken out of  its\n\npackaging,  but rather  appeared  two or  three days  thereafter.\n\nLaboratory  tests performed at the request of JRS showed that the\n\nglass did  not meet  the  Navy's requirements  for visible  light\n\ntransmission.    JRS  notified  the  defendants  of  the  alleged\n\ndefects,  for the  first  time, in  a  telephone conversation  on\n\nFebruary 25, 1992, and again, in writing, in a letter dated March\n\n2, 1992.\n\n          The defendants  did not  replace the glass  because JRS\n\nfailed  to comply  with  their requirements  for presentation  of\n\nclaims.   These requirements  were set forth  in the  defendants'\n\n\"General Terms and Conditions of Sale\" (\"General Terms\").\n\n          Falconer  Glass and  Falconer  Lewiston both  sent  JRS\n\ncopies of the General Terms.  The General Terms were set forth on\n\nthe  order form  that  Falconer Glass  sent  JRS along  with  its\n\nquotation.  Additionally, Falconer Lewiston provided JRS with the\n\nGeneral Terms when Falconer Lewiston acknowledged the order.\n\n          Paragraph 16 of the General Terms provided:\n\n            Presentation  of Claims -- Every claim on\n                                                     \n            account  of  defective or  non-conforming\n                                                     \n            material or from any other cause shall be\n                                                     \n            deemed  waived  by  the purchaser  unless\n                                                     \n\n                               -3-\n\n            made in  writing within ten (10)  days of\n                                                     \n            the receipt  of the goods  to which  such\n                                     \n            claim  relates for breach  of contract or\n            warranty and any action must be commenced\n            within one year after tender  of goods by\n            the Seller,  or receipt  of goods by  the\n            Purchaser  or after  the cause  of action\n            has    accrued,   whichever    shall   be\n            applicable in the circumstances.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n          JRS  filed  suit for  breach  of  contract against  the\n\ndefendants on May  22, 1992.   The defendants  moved for  summary\n\njudgment.    The district  court  granted  the motion  and  final\n\njudgment  was entered on November  18, 1993.   The district court\n\nfound that JRS's  claim was barred by  Section 260 of the  Puerto\n\nRico  Commerce Code which establishes a thirty day time limit for\n\nfiling of certain claims.  10 L.P.R.A.   1718 (1989).   The court\n\nalso  indicated that the  10-day presentation-of-claims provision\n\nin the General Terms may, by itself, determine the outcome of the\n\ncase, but found that issue to be moot in light of Section 260.\n\n          On December 3,  1993, JRS  filed a motion  to alter  or\n\namend the judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).  The court denied\n\nthe motion by order dated March 1, 1994.\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\n                                          \n\n          Entry  of  summary  judgment is  appropriate  when \"the\n\npleadings,   depositions,   answers   to   interrogatories,   and\n\nadmissions  on file, together  with the affidavits,  if any, show\n\nthat there is  no genuine issue as to any  material fact and that\n\nthe  moving party is  entitled to judgment  as a  matter of law.\"\n\nFed.

Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co.,\n                                                                \n\n                               -4-\n\n871  F.2d 179,  181 (1st Cir.  1989).   Our review  of a district\n\ncourt's grant of summary  judgment is plenary.  LeBlanc  v. Great\n                                                                 \n\nAmerican Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 841 (1st Cir. 1993).   We view the\n                 \n\nrecord in the  light most  favorable to the  nonmoving party  and\n\ndraw all reasonable  inferences  in the nonmoving party's  favor.\n\nId.\n   \n\n          We review  the trial court's decision  denying a motion\n\nto  alter or amend a  judgment for manifest  abuse of discretion.\n\nAppeal of Sun Pipe Line Co.,  831 F.2d 22, 24-25 (1st Cir. 1987),\n                           \n\ncert. denied, 486 U.S. 1055 (1988).\n            \n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          The district court found that this case is  governed by\n\nthe Commerce Code  of Puerto  Rico.  Chapter  51 of the  Commerce\n\nCode   provides  that   the  Code   applies  to   all  commercial\n\ntransactions,  regardless  of  whether they  are  consummated  by\n\nmerchants.   P.R. Laws Ann. tit  10,   1002.   The district court\n\nfound, and the parties  do not dispute, that they  were merchants\n\nengaged in a commercial transaction.   The Code contains specific\n\nprovisions governing  commercial purchases  and sales.    Section\n\n243  defines \"commercial  purchase and  sale\" to  which the  code\n\napplies:\n\n            A  purchase and sale of personal property\n            for the purpose of resale, either in  the\n            form it  was purchased or in  a different\n            form,  for the purpose of deriving profit\n            in  the  resale,   shall  be   considered\n            commercial.--Commerce Code, 1932,   243.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,   1701.\n\n          The  district court  determined  that the  30 day  time\n\n                               -5-\n\nlimitation  of Section 260 applied  to JRS's claim.   Section 260\n\nprovides:\n\n                               -6-\n\n          Failure to file a claim on account of defects.\n\n            A purchaser  who has  not made  any claim\n            based  on the  inherent  defects  in  the\n            article  sold,  within  the  thirty  days\n            following  its  delivery, shall  lose all\n            rights of action  against the vendor  for\n            such  defects.--Commerce  Code,  1932,   \n            260.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,   1718.\n\n          Because JRS failed  to claim any  defects in the  glass\n\nwithin  30 days  of delivery,  the court  found that  Section 260\n\nbarred its suit against the defendants.\n\n          On appeal,  JRS contends that the  district court erred\n\nin applying Section  260 to  this case.   JRS  contends that  the\n\npresent  case is  an  action  for  breach  of  contract  and  the\n\napplicable  statute of limitations is  fifteen years.  Camacho v.\n                                                              \n\nIglesia Cat lica, 72 P.R.R. 332, 340 (1951);  Saavedra v. Central\n                                                                 \n\nColoso,  Inc., 85  P.R.R.  404,  405  (1962).    The  statute  of\n             \n\nlimitations for actions for  breach of contract is  determined by\n\nSection  1864  of the  Puerto Rico  Civil  Code which  provides a\n\nfifteen  year  statute  of  limitations for  actions  \"which  are\n\npersonal and for which  no special term of proscription  has been\n\nfixed.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,   5294.  Hence, the fifteen year\n\nstatute of  limitations  period  would  apply only  if  no  other\n\nproscription,  including  that provided  by  Section  260 of  the\n\nCommerce Code, were applicable to this case.\n\n          In order  to determine  whether Section 260  applies to\n\nthis  case we  are  guided by  the  Puerto Rico  Supreme  Court's\n\ndecision  in Julsrud v. Peche de Puerto Rico, Inc., 115 P.R.R. 23\n                                                  \n\n                               -7-\n\n(1983).  In Julsrud,  the court distinguished circumstances under\n                   \n\nwhich the statute  of limitations for breach  of contract applies\n\nfrom circumstances to which claims of defects apply:\n\n            The first distinction we must consider is\n            that   existing  between   another  thing\n            (aliud)  and  defective  thing.    When a\n                  \n            specific  thing  different  from the  one\n            agreed upon  is delivered, the  figure of\n            another  thing or  aliud pro  alio, comes\n                                              \n            into  play, which  allows  the  buyer  to\n            bring  an action  for breach  of contract\n            within   the   corresponding  period   of\n            limitation.  When the very thing required\n            is  delivered, even  if it  is defective,\n            the   seller   has   complied  with   his\n            obligation to furnish the thing required.\n            What we  have then  is the delivery  of a\n            defective   thing,    and   the   actions\n            available are the aedilitian actions--the\n            redhibitory  or quanti  minoris actions--\n                                           \n            whose  life  is  much  shorter  than  the\n            action for breach of contract.\n\n115 P.R.R. at 28-29 (footnote and internal citation omitted).\n\n          Equating \"inherent defect\" to a \"hidden defect,\" id. at\n                                                              \n\n31, the court  defined a \"hidden defect\" to which  the thirty day\n\nlimitation of Section 260 applies:\n\n            A hidden defect is that which escapes the\n            eye of an ordinarily diligent person, the\n            defect  that is inherent to the imperfect\n            way   in   which   the  merchandise   was\n            manufactured, packed, handled, or stored,\n            and  which  renders the  thing inadequate\n            for the use for which it is destined.\n\nId. at 30 (internal citation omitted).\n   \n\n          JRS has  not claimed that defendants  failed to deliver\n\nthe  glass.   Rather,  they claim  that  the glass  delivered was\n\ninadequate  for its  intended use.   JRS  has indicated  that the\n\nstaining of  the glass did not  start to show when  the glass was\n\n                               -8-\n\ntaken  out  of  its packaging,  but  rather,  two  or three  days\n\nthereafter,  and JRS contends that  the source of  the defect was\n\nthe  glass manufacturing  process.   JRS's claims  falls squarely\n\ninto the definition of \"inherent\" or \"hidden\" defect set forth in\n\nJulsrud.\n       \n\n          Furthermore,  this Court has held that litigants cannot\n\ncircumvent  a  specific  provision of  the  Puerto  Rico Code  by\n\ncharacterizing their  claims generally as a  \"breach of contract\"\n\nin order to obtain the benefit of a longer statute of limitations\n\nperiod.  Kali  Seafood, Inc. v.  Howe Corp., 887  F.2d 7, 9  (1st\n                                           \n\nCir. 1989); Betancourt v.  W.D. Schock Corp., 907 F.2d  1251 (1st\n                                            \n\nCir. 1990).\n\n          In  Kali, we determined that  litigants who had a claim\n                  \n\nfor hidden defects, to which the six month statute of limitations\n\nperiod of  P.R. Laws  Ann. tit.  31,    3847  applied, could  not\n\ncircumvent that limitations period  by characterizing their claim\n\nas one for breach of contract:\n\n            Because virtually every sale results from\n            a  contract  (express   or  implied),   a\n            disappointed  vendee could  always bypass\n            the    statute's    narrow   window    of\n            opportunity in favor of the thirty-times-\n            wider window afforded  by P.R.

Jan. 18, 1982) (affected  purchaser may not use\n\na general action to  evade applicable rules related to  a special\n\naction that are incompatible with  the provisions of the  general\n\naction).  We therefore  conclude that the district court  did not\n\nerr in applying Section 260 to this case.1\n\n          JRS's  remaining arguments  were raised  for the  first\n\ntime in its  motion to alter or amend the  judgment under Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 59(e) which the district court denied.    JRS raised four\n\narguments  in its  Rule  59(e) motion  which  it now  pursues  on\n\nappeal: 1) when the defendants agreed to the Navy specifications,\n\nthey  superseded the  10-day term  contained in  their  order and\n\nwaived  the 30-day term prescribed  by Article 260  of the Puerto\n\nRico Commerce Code; 2)  defendants somehow acted in bad  faith by\n\nfailing  to make clear at  the time of  contracting that, despite\n\nNavy  specifications, defendants would limit the time in which to\n\nnotify claims to the 10 or  30 day notice periods provided in the\n\n\"General Terms\" and Section 30 respectively; 3) the inclusion  by\n\nthe defendants in  the \"General Terms\" of  a different limitation\n\nperiod  from   the  one  implied  by   the  Navy  Specifications,\n\nconstitutes an act contrary to good faith  and as such, should be\n\nrendered  invalid and  illegal; and  4)   insofar as  Section 260\n\n                    \n\n1   JRS contends  that Section  260 does  not apply  to specially\nmanufactured products.  However, JRS has failed to cite any legal\nauthority in support of  this contention.  We have  not found any\nsuch authority and decline their invitation to create new law.\n\n                               -10-\n\nrequires  a purchaser to make a claim for inherent defects before\n\nobtaining  knowledge   of  their  existence,  the   provision  is\n\nunconstitutional  because it  violates  the purchaser's  property\n\nrights without due process of law.\n\n          This court has explained that a motion under Rule 59(e)\n\nis not appropriately used to present new issues or evidence:\n\n            Rule   59(e)   motions   are   aimed   at\n            reconsideration,        not       initial\n              \n            consideration.  Thus, parties  should not\n            use  them to raise arguments which could,\n            and   should,   have  been   made  before\n            judgment  issued.    Motions  under  Rule\n            59(e)  must  either  clearly establish  a\n            manifest  error of  law  or must  present\n            newly discovered evidence.  They  may not\n            be used to argue a new legal theory.\n\nFederal Deposit  Ins. Corp. v. World Univ., Inc., 978 F.2d 10, 16\n                                                \n\n(1st Cir. 1992) (internal citations and  quotations omitted).\n\n          Because the  first  of these  arguments  raises  issues\n\naddressed by the  district court  in its opinion,  we address  it\n\nbelow.  The remaining  three arguments, however, neither \"clearly\n\nestablish a manifest  error of law\" nor \"present newly discovered\n\nevidence\" and are therefore not properly before us.  Id.\n                                                        \n\n          Paragraph 1.3  of the prime contract  specifications in\n\nthe contract between the Navy and GRG provided:\n\n               1.3 DELIVERY, STORAGE, AND HANDLING\n\n              Deliver   products   to  the   site  in\n            unopened containers, labeled plainly with\n            manufacturers' names and  brands.   Store\n            glass and setting  materials in safe, dry\n            locations and do not unpack  until needed\n            for  installation.    Handle and  install\n            materials in  a manner that  will protect\n            them from damage.\n\n                               -11-\n\n          Throughout this litigation, JRS has contended that they\n\nwere  bound  by these  specifications  and  therefore, could  not\n\ninspect  the glass  when it  was delivered.   The  district court\n\nfound  that this argument was  irrelevant to the issues presented\n\nin this case because the contracts between the Navy, GRG, and JRS\n\nin  no  way  involve or  bind  Falconer,  Lewiston,  or Guardian.\n\nFurthermore, the district court noted that the Navy specification\n\nreferred  to \"delivery\" and \"unpacking\" and that neither of these\n\nterms prohibits inspecting the product to insure its safe arrival\n\nand conformance to contract specifications.\n\n          JRS concedes that  the defendants did not  enter into a\n\ndirect  contractual relationship  with  either the  Navy or  GRG.\n\nHowever, because  the Navy  specifications were forwarded  to the\n\ndefendants for  their acceptance before contracting, JRS contends\n\nthat  the   specifications  became   a  medullary  part   of  the\n\ncontractual relationship between JRS and the defendants.\n\n          We find several problems with JRS's argument.  Like the\n\ndistrict court,  we do not  believe that the  Navy specifications\n\nprevented JRS  from inspecting the glass.   Not only do  the Navy\n\nspecifications say  nothing about  inspection,  but the  \"General\n\nTerms\" provided to JRS by the defendants contained  the following\n\nprovision:\n\n            6. INSPECTION--The Buyer  may inspect  or\n            provide for inspections  at the place  of\n            manufacture.  Such  inspections shall  be\n            conducted    as    not    to    interfere\n            unreasonably   with   the  manufacturer's\n            operations,  and  consequent approval  or\n            rejection shall be  made before  shipment\n            of  the  material.   Notwithstanding  the\n\n                               -12-\n\n            foregoing  the  Buyer  shall inspect  the\n            material upon his receipt of same, and if\n            the same  shall appear not to  conform to\n            the  contract between  the Buyer  and the\n            Seller,   the  Buyer   shall  immediately\n            notify  the Seller of  such condition and\n            afford    the    Seller   a    reasonable\n            opportunity to inspect  the material.  No\n            material  shall  be returned  without the\n            Seller's consent.\n\n          If  JRS  felt that  it should  not  open the  goods for\n\ninspection  on arrival,  it  could have  arranged to  inspect the\n\ngoods at the  place of the manufacturer's operations.  Otherwise,\n\nit  could have arranged to  delay delivery until  it was ready to\n\nuse the  materials.  JRS could  have also removed samples  of the\n\nglass  and   subjected  them   to  whatever  testing   it  deemed\n\nappropriate.   Finally,  the  \"General Terms\"  clearly show  that\n\ndefendants did not intend to incorporate into their contract with\n\nJRS any limitation on the inspection of goods but rather required\n\ninspection  and  immediate  notification  to the  Seller  of  any\n\nnonconformity of the goods.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -13-\n",

Engineering, S.E.  (\"GRG\"), to replace the windows at Building 31 at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Base in Ceiba, Puerto Rico.  GRG was the Navy's prime contractor for this project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prime contract between the Navy and GRG contained various specifications for the new window glass.  Among the specifications were the requirements that the glass provide 39% visible light transmission and .005% ultraviolet light transmission.  Paragraph 1.3 of the prime contract specifications provided that the glass was to be delivered to the site in unopened containers, stored in a safe, dry place, and was not to be unpacked until needed for installation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JRS ordered the glass for the project from Falconer Glass pursuant to a purchase order dated November 16, 1990.  The glass was packed and shipped by Falconer Lewiston.  Guardian is alleged to be the successor in interest to Falconer Glass.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The glass was delivered to JRS in or about April, 1991.  JRS stored the glass in its warehouse.  JRS did not inspect the glass until February of 1992, when it began installation.  In February 1992, JRS noticed defects in the glass.  Glass panes which had recently been installed were stained with rainbow-like marks, which resulted in an iridescent effect on their surface.  The staining did not show when the glass was taken out of its packaging, but rather appeared two or three days thereafter.  Laboratory tests performed at the request of JRS showed that the glass did not meet the Navy's requirements for visible light transmission.  JRS notified the defendants of the alleged defects, for the first time, in a telephone conversation on February 25, 1992, and again, in writing, in a letter dated March 2, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants did not replace the glass because JRS failed to comply with their requirements for presentation of claims.

The defendants moved for summary judgment.  The district court granted the motion and final judgment was entered on November 18, 1993.  The district court found that JRS's claim was barred by Section 260 of the Puerto Rico Commerce Code which establishes a thirty day time limit for filing of certain claims.  10 L.P.R.A. Sec. 1718 (1989). The court also indicated that the 10-day presentation-of-claims provision in the General Terms may, by itself, determine the outcome of the case, but found that issue to be moot in light of Section 260.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 3, 1993, JRS filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e).

Chapter 51 of the Commerce Code provides that the Code applies to all commercial transactions, regardless of whether they are consummated by merchants.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit 10, Sec. 1002.  The district court found, and the parties do not dispute, that they were merchants engaged in a commercial transaction.  The Code contains specific provisions governing commercial purchases and sales.  Section 243 defines \"commercial purchase and sale\" to which the code applies:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>A purchase and sale of personal property for the purpose of resale, either in the form it was purchased or in a different form, for the purpose of deriving profit in the resale, shall be considered commercial.--Commerce Code, 1932, Sec. 243.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 10, Sec. 1701.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that the 30 day time limitation of Section 260 applied to JRS's claim.  Section 260 provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Failure to file a claim on account of defects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>A purchaser who has not made any claim based on the inherent defects in the article sold, within the thirty days following its delivery, shall lose all rights of action against the vendor for such defects.--Commerce Code, 1932, Sec. 260.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 10, Sec. 1718.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because JRS failed to claim any defects in the glass within 30 days of delivery, the court found that Section 260 barred its suit against the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, JRS contends that the district court erred in applying Section 260 to this case.  JRS contends that the present case is an action for breach of contract and the applicable statute of limitations is fifteen years.  Camacho v. Iglesia Catolica, 72 P.R.R. 332, 340 (1951);  Saavedra v. Central Coloso, Inc., 85 P.R.R. 404, 405 (1962).  The statute of limitations for actions for breach of contract is determined by Section 1864 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code which provides a fifteen year statute of limitations for actions \"which are personal and for which no special term of prescription is fixed.\"   P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 5294.  Hence, the fifteen year statute of limitations period would apply only if no other proscription, including that provided by Section 260 of the Commerce Code, were applicable to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to determine whether Section 260 applies to this case we are guided by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decision in Julsrud v. Peche de Puerto Rico, Inc., 115 P.R.R. 23 (1983).  In Julsrud, the court distinguished circumstances under which the statute of limitations for breach of contract applies from circumstances to which claims of defects apply:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>The first distinction we must consider is that existing between another thing (aliud )nd defective thing.  When a specific thing different from the one agreed upon is delivered, the figure of another thing or aliud pro alio, comes into play, which allows the buyer to bring an action for breach of contract within the corresponding period of limitation.  When the very thing required is delivered, even if it is defective, the seller has complied with his obligation to furnish the thing required.  What we have then is the delivery of a defective thing, and the actions available are the aedilitian actions--the redhibitory or quanti minoris actions--whose life is much shorter than the action for breach of contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">115 P.R.R. at 28-29 (footnote and internal citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equating \"inherent defect\" to a \"hidden defect,\" id. at 31, the court defined a \"hidden defect\" to which the thirty day limitation of Section 260 applies:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>A hidden defect is that which escapes the eye of an ordinarily diligent person, the defect that is inherent to the imperfect way in which the merchandise was manufactured, packed, handled, or stored, and which renders the thing inadequate for the use for which it is destined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 30 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JRS has not claimed that defendants failed to deliver the glass.  Rather, they claim that the glass delivered was inadequate for its intended use.  JRS has indicated that the staining of the glass did not start to show when the glass was taken out of its packaging, but rather, two or three days thereafter, and JRS contends that the source of the defect was the glass manufacturing process.  JRS's claims falls squarely into the definition of \"inherent\" or \"hidden\" defect set forth in Julsrud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, this Court has held that litigants cannot circumvent a specific provision of the Puerto Rico Code by characterizing their claims generally as a \"breach of contract\" in order to obtain the benefit of a longer statute of limitations period.  Kali Seafood, Inc. v. Howe Corp., 887 F.2d 7, 9 (1st Cir.1989);  Betancourt v. W.D. Schock Corp., 907 F.2d 1251 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Kali, we determined that litigants who had a claim for hidden defects, to which the six month statute of limitations period of P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 3847 applied, could not circumvent that limitations period by characterizing their claim as one for breach of contract:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>Because virtually every sale results from a contract (express or implied), a disappointed vendee could always bypass the statute's narrow window of opportunity in favor of the thirty-times-wider window afforded by P.R.

JRS raised four arguments in its Rule 59(e) motion which it now pursues on appeal:  1) when the defendants agreed to the Navy specifications, they superseded the 10-day term contained in their order and waived the 30-day term prescribed by Section 260 of the Puerto Rico Commerce Code;  2) defendants somehow acted in bad faith by failing to make clear at the time of contracting that, despite Navy specifications, defendants would limit the time in which to notify claims to the 10 or 30 day notice periods provided in the \"General Terms\" and Section 30 respectively;  3) the inclusion by the defendants in the \"General Terms\" of a different limitation period from the one implied by the Navy Specifications, constitutes an act contrary to good faith and as such, should be rendered invalid and illegal;  and 4) insofar as Section 260 requires a purchaser to make a claim for inherent defects before obtaining knowledge of their existence, the provision is unconstitutional because it violates the purchaser's property rights without due process of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has explained that a motion under Rule 59(e) is not appropriately used to present new issues or evidence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>Rule 59(e) motions are aimed at reconsideration, not initial consideration.  Thus, parties should not use them to raise arguments which could, and should, have been made before judgment issued.

The remaining three arguments, however, neither \"clearly establish a manifest error of law\" nor \"present newly discovered evidence\" and are therefore not properly before us.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 1.3 of the prime contract specifications in the contract between the Navy and GRG provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1.3 DELIVERY, STORAGE, AND HANDLING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Deliver products to the site in unopened containers, labeled plainly with manufacturers' names and brands.

The district court found that this argument was irrelevant to the issues presented in this case because the contracts between the Navy, GRG, and JRS in no way involve or bind Falconer, Lewiston, or Guardian.  Furthermore, the district court noted that the Navy specification referred to \"delivery\" and \"unpacking\" and that neither of these terms prohibits inspecting the product to insure its safe arrival and conformance to contract specifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JRS concedes that the defendants did not enter into a direct contractual relationship with either the Navy or GRG.  However, because the Navy specifications were forwarded to the defendants for their acceptance before contracting, JRS contends that the specifications became a medullary part of the contractual relationship between JRS and the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find several problems with JRS's argument.  Like the district court, we do not believe that the Navy specifications prevented JRS from inspecting the glass.  Not only do the Navy specifications say nothing about inspection, but the \"General Terms\" provided to JRS by the defendants contained the following provision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>6.  INSPECTION--The Buyer may inspect or provide for inspections at the place of manufacture.  Such inspections shall be conducted as not to interfere unreasonably with the manufacturer's operations, and consequent approval or rejection shall be made before shipment of the material.  Notwithstanding the foregoing the Buyer shall inspect the material upon his receipt of same, and if the same shall appear not to conform to the contract between the Buyer and the Seller, the Buyer shall immediately notify the Seller of such condition and afford the Seller a reasonable opportunity to inspect the material.  No material shall be returned without the Seller's consent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If JRS felt that it should not open the goods for inspection on arrival, it could have arranged to inspect the goods at the place of the manufacturer's operations.  Otherwise, it could have arranged to delay delivery until it was ready to use the materials.  JRS could have also removed samples of the glass and subjected them to whatever testing it deemed appropriate.  Finally, the \"General Terms\" clearly show that defendants did not intend to incorporate into their contract with JRS any limitation on the inspection of goods but rather required inspection and immediate notification to the Seller of any nonconformity of the goods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> JRS contends that Section 260 does not apply to specially manufactured products.

Engineering, S.E.  (\"GRG\"), to replace the windows at Building 31 at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Base in Ceiba, Puerto Rico.  GRG was the Navy's prime contractor for this project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prime contract between the Navy and GRG contained various specifications for the new window glass.  Among the specifications were the requirements that the glass provide 39% visible light transmission and .005% ultraviolet light transmission.  Paragraph 1.3 of the prime contract specifications provided that the glass was to be delivered to the site in unopened containers, stored in a safe, dry place, and was not to be unpacked until needed for installation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JRS ordered the glass for the project from Falconer Glass pursuant to a purchase order dated November 16, 1990.  The glass was packed and shipped by Falconer Lewiston.  Guardian is alleged to be the successor in interest to Falconer Glass.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The glass was delivered to JRS in or about April, 1991.  JRS stored the glass in its warehouse.  JRS did not inspect the glass until February of 1992, when it began installation.  In February 1992, JRS noticed defects in the glass.  Glass panes which had recently been installed were stained with rainbow-like marks, which resulted in an iridescent effect on their surface.  The staining did not show when the glass was taken out of its packaging, but rather appeared two or three days thereafter.  Laboratory tests performed at the request of JRS showed that the glass did not meet the Navy's requirements for visible light transmission.  JRS notified the defendants of the alleged defects, for the first time, in a telephone conversation on February 25, 1992, and again, in writing, in a letter dated March 2, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants did not replace the glass because JRS failed to comply with their requirements for presentation of claims.

The defendants moved for summary judgment.  The district court granted the motion and final judgment was entered on November 18, 1993.  The district court found that JRS's claim was barred by Section 260 of the Puerto Rico Commerce Code which establishes a thirty day time limit for filing of certain claims.  10 L.P.R.A. Sec. 1718 (1989). The court also indicated that the 10-day presentation-of-claims provision in the General Terms may, by itself, determine the outcome of the case, but found that issue to be moot in light of Section 260.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 3, 1993, JRS filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e).

Chapter 51 of the Commerce Code provides that the Code applies to all commercial transactions, regardless of whether they are consummated by merchants.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit 10, Sec. 1002.  The district court found, and the parties do not dispute, that they were merchants engaged in a commercial transaction.  The Code contains specific provisions governing commercial purchases and sales.  Section 243 defines \"commercial purchase and sale\" to which the code applies:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>A purchase and sale of personal property for the purpose of resale, either in the form it was purchased or in a different form, for the purpose of deriving profit in the resale, shall be considered commercial.--Commerce Code, 1932, Sec. 243.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 10, Sec. 1701.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that the 30 day time limitation of Section 260 applied to JRS's claim.

JRS contends that the present case is an action for breach of contract and the applicable statute of limitations is fifteen years.  Camacho v. Iglesia Catolica, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></span>, 340 (1951);  Saavedra v. Central Coloso, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></span>, 405 (1962).  The statute of limitations for actions for breach of contract is determined by Section 1864 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code which provides a fifteen year statute of limitations for actions \"which are personal and for which no special term of prescription is fixed.\"   P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 5294.  Hence, the fifteen year statute of limitations period would apply only if no other proscription, including that provided by Section 260 of the Commerce Code, were applicable to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to determine whether Section 260 applies to this case we are guided by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decision in Julsrud v. Peche de Puerto Rico, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span> </span>(1983).  In Julsrud, the court distinguished circumstances under which the statute of limitations for breach of contract applies from circumstances to which claims of defects apply:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>The first distinction we must consider is that existing between another thing (aliud )nd defective thing.  When a specific thing different from the one agreed upon is delivered, the figure of another thing or aliud pro alio, comes into play, which allows the buyer to bring an action for breach of contract within the corresponding period of limitation.  When the very thing required is delivered, even if it is defective, the seller has complied with his obligation to furnish the thing required.  What we have then is the delivery of a defective thing, and the actions available are the aedilitian actions--the redhibitory or quanti minoris actions--whose life is much shorter than the action for breach of contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">115 P.R.R. at 28-29 (footnote and internal citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equating \"inherent defect\" to a \"hidden defect,\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 31, </span>the court defined a \"hidden defect\" to which the thirty day limitation of Section 260 applies:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>A hidden defect is that which escapes the eye of an ordinarily diligent person, the defect that is inherent to the imperfect way in which the merchandise was manufactured, packed, handled, or stored, and which renders the thing inadequate for the use for which it is destined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 30 </span>(internal citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JRS has not claimed that defendants failed to deliver the glass.  Rather, they claim that the glass delivered was inadequate for its intended use.  JRS has indicated that the staining of the glass did not start to show when the glass was taken out of its packaging, but rather, two or three days thereafter, and JRS contends that the source of the defect was the glass manufacturing process.  JRS's claims falls squarely into the definition of \"inherent\" or \"hidden\" defect set forth in Julsrud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, this Court has held that litigants cannot circumvent a specific provision of the Puerto Rico Code by characterizing their claims generally as a \"breach of contract\" in order to obtain the benefit of a longer statute of limitations period.

Unrestrained access to such an end run would serve completely to eviscerate the special statute of limitations which the legislature thought should apply to product sales in Puerto Rico.

Jan. 18, 1982) (affected purchaser may not use a general action to evade applicable rules related to a special action that are incompatible with the provisions of the general action).  We therefore conclude that the district court did not err in applying Section 260 to this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JRS's remaining arguments were raised for the first time in its motion to alter or amend the judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) which the district court denied.  JRS raised four arguments in its Rule 59(e) motion which it now pursues on appeal:  1) when the defendants agreed to the Navy specifications, they superseded the 10-day term contained in their order and waived the 30-day term prescribed by Section 260 of the Puerto Rico Commerce Code;  2) defendants somehow acted in bad faith by failing to make clear at the time of contracting that, despite Navy specifications, defendants would limit the time in which to notify claims to the 10 or 30 day notice periods provided in the \"General Terms\" and Section 30 respectively;  3) the inclusion by the defendants in the \"General Terms\" of a different limitation period from the one implied by the Navy Specifications, constitutes an act contrary to good faith and as such, should be rendered invalid and illegal;  and 4) insofar as Section 260 requires a purchaser to make a claim for inherent defects before obtaining knowledge of their existence, the provision is unconstitutional because it violates the purchaser's property rights without due process of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has explained that a motion under Rule 59(e) is not appropriately used to present new issues or evidence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>Rule 59(e) motions are aimed at reconsideration, not initial consideration.  Thus, parties should not use them to raise arguments which could, and should, have been made before judgment issued.  Motions under Rule 59(e) must either clearly establish a manifest error of law or must present newly discovered evidence.  They may not be used to argue a new legal theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v.

The remaining three arguments, however, neither \"clearly establish a manifest error of law\" nor \"present newly discovered evidence\" and are therefore not properly before us.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 1.3 of the prime contract specifications in the contract between the Navy and GRG provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1.3 DELIVERY, STORAGE, AND HANDLING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Deliver products to the site in unopened containers, labeled plainly with manufacturers' names and brands.  Store glass and setting materials in safe, dry locations and do not unpack until needed for installation.  Handle and install materials in a manner that will protect them from damage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout this litigation, JRS has contended that they were bound by these specifications and therefore, could not inspect the glass when it was delivered.  The district court found that this argument was irrelevant to the issues presented in this case because the contracts between the Navy, GRG, and JRS in no way involve or bind Falconer, Lewiston, or Guardian.  Furthermore, the district court noted that the Navy specification referred to \"delivery\" and \"unpacking\" and that neither of these terms prohibits inspecting the product to insure its safe arrival and conformance to contract specifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JRS concedes that the defendants did not enter into a direct contractual relationship with either the Navy or GRG.  However, because the Navy specifications were forwarded to the defendants for their acceptance before contracting, JRS contends that the specifications became a medullary part of the contractual relationship between JRS and the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find several problems with JRS's argument.  Like the district court, we do not believe that the Navy specifications prevented JRS from inspecting the glass.  Not only do the Navy specifications say nothing about inspection, but the \"General Terms\" provided to JRS by the defendants contained the following provision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>6.  INSPECTION--The Buyer may inspect or provide for inspections at the place of manufacture.  Such inspections shall be conducted as not to interfere unreasonably with the manufacturer's operations, and consequent approval or rejection shall be made before shipment of the material.  Notwithstanding the foregoing the Buyer shall inspect the material upon his receipt of same, and if the same shall appear not to conform to the contract between the Buyer and the Seller, the Buyer shall immediately notify the Seller of such condition and afford the Seller a reasonable opportunity to inspect the material.  No material shall be returned without the Seller's consent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If JRS felt that it should not open the goods for inspection on arrival, it could have arranged to inspect the goods at the place of the manufacturer's operations.  Otherwise, it could have arranged to delay delivery until it was ready to use the materials.  JRS could have also removed samples of the glass and subjected them to whatever testing it deemed appropriate.  Finally, the \"General Terms\" clearly show that defendants did not intend to incorporate into their contract with JRS any limitation on the inspection of goods but rather required inspection and immediate notification to the Seller of any nonconformity of the goods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> JRS contends that Section 260 does not apply to specially manufactured products.
