There was  no abuse of  discretion in  the\r                           \r\n\ndistrict  court's  denial   of  plaintiff-appellant   Anthony\r\n\nSolimine's motion, filed  pursuant to Fed. R.  Civ. P. 60(b).\r\n\nIn granting  Solimine's motion to proceed  in forma pauperis,\r\n\nin December 1994, the district court expressly indicated that\r\n\nit was not  ruling on  the sufficiency of  the complaints  to\r\n\nstate a claim for relief and that its dismissal of a  similar\r\n\nprior complaint was then pending in this court.  On March 24,\r\n\n1995,  we  affirmed the  district  court's  dismissal of  two\r\n\nsubstantially identical cases,  noting that those  complaints\r\n\nwere based  on  \"an  indisputably  meritless  legal  theory.\"\r\n\nSolimine v.

The  district court's  action,\r\n\nshortly  thereafter  on  April   6,  1996,  that  (1)  denied\r\n\nSolimine's  request   to  enlarge  the  time   to  serve  the\r\n\ndefendants with the instant complaints that do  not differ in\r\n\nany  material respect  from his earlier-filed  complaints and\r\n\n(2) closed these consolidated cases was completely justified.\r\n\n     The government  has  filed a  motion  asking us  to  bar\r\n\nSolimine  from  filing  further  appeals against  it  or  its\r\n\nagencies relating to Solimine's 1991 hospitalizations and his\r\n\n1991  visits to the offices  of the F.B.I.  and U.S. Attorney\r\n\nseeking their  help in this matter.

The motion is therefore denied.\r\n\n     Nonetheless, our present denial  is without prejudice to\r                 Nonetheless\r                            \r\n\nrenewal  by the  government  in the  future, should  Solimine\r\n\ncontinue  to pursue repetitive,  frivolous litigation against\r\n\nthe government or  its agencies.   We note  that the  instant\r\n\nappeal is the  sixth attempt  by Solimine  to seek  appellate\r\n\nreview  of a matter, which  we have consistently  ruled to be\r\n\nwithout  a  basis  in law.
