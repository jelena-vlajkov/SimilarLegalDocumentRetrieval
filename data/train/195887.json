Twelve counts  of the\n\nindictment were predicated  specifically on illegal  gambling\n\nallegedly in violation of Massachusetts General Laws ch. 271,\n\n   7 and 17.  The counts involving the Massachusetts statutes\n\nwere:   two  RICO  counts; two  counts  of  using  interstate\n\nfacilities in aid of racketeering; one count  of operating an\n\nillegal   gambling  business;  and   seven  counts  of  money\n\nlaundering.   There  can  be no  doubt  of the  right  of the\n\nfederal government to base a federal crime upon the violation\n\nof a state statute.  Sanabria v.

ILLEGAL GAMBLING UNDER THE MASSACHUSETTS STATUTES\r                I.  ILLEGAL GAMBLING UNDER THE MASSACHUSETTS STATUTES\n\n          Defendant owned  and operated the  Revere Amusement\n\nCompany (\"Revere\") from 1981  to 1989.  Revere's  income came\n\nfrom the operation  of video poker machines that  were placed\n\nin  an  assortment of  bars,  taverns,  and social  clubs  in\n\nRevere, Massachusetts.  The  poker machines operated somewhat\n\nlike slot machines.   The machine was  activated by inserting\n\nmoney into it,  at least a  quarter.  The  player would  then\n\nmanipulate  a button to obtain  a poker hand.   The machine's\n\nvideo screen  would display  five cards representing  a poker\n\nhand.   Before the  \"play\" began,  the  screen displayed  the\n\npayoffs for winning hands;  i.e., a hand consisting  of three\n\nof a  kind might pay twelve  to one.  Credits  were given for\n\nwinning  hands.   For  example, a  full  house might  pay ten\n\ncredits.    After  a  winning  player  finished  playing  the\n\nmachine, he exchanged his credits for cash.  The cash payment\n\nwas  made by  the person  in charge  of the  establishment in\n\nwhich  the  machine(s) was  located.    Defendant and/or  his\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nemployees  visited the  approximately seventeen  places where\n\nthe poker machines  were located on a regular  basis, usually\n\ndaily.  The proprietors of the establishments were reimbursed\n\nfor the payoffs  and then the  machine's proceeds were  split\n\nwith  them.     Normally,  no   records  were  kept   of  the\n\ntransactions.    And,  of  course,  only  defendant  and  his\n\nemployees had  access  to  the monies  paid  into  the  poker\n\nmachine.\n\n          In 1985  defendant decided  to enjoy the  fruits of\n\nhis   profitable  business   and   moved  to   Palm  Springs,\n\nCalifornia.   Defendant's  son,  Steven, then  took over  the\n\ndaily  operation  of Revere.1    Defendant,  however, kept  a\n\ntight  reign on  Revere's operations from  Palm Springs.   He\n\nreceived between  $4,000 to $10,000  in cash by  express mail\n\nseveral times a week.   At irregular intervals, he  asked his\n\nemployees to  keep records  of the  transactions so he  would\n\nknow what was going on.\n\n          Revere's income from the poker machines amounted to\n\nabout $500,000 per year.  There  was convincing evidence that\n\ndefendant  made regular  payoffs  to  local police  officers,\n\npoliticians, and organized crime.   Neither defendant nor his\n\ncompany  paid state  or  federal  income  tax on  the  income\n\ngenerated by the video poker game machines.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Steven Marder was indicted along with his father; he pled\nguilty prior to trial.\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          With  this  factual  background,  we  turn  to  the\n\nquestion of whether defendant's poker game  business violated\n\nthe implicated  Massachusetts statutes.  This  is, of course,\n\nprimarily a question of  Massachusetts law.  And there  is no\n\nMassachusetts  case directly  on  point.   We first  consider\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 271,   17, which provides:\n\n             17.   Place  for  registering bets  or\r                         17.

It includes \"any device\n\nfor registering  bets, or buying  or selling pools,  upon the\n\nresult of a trial or contest  of skill, speed or endurance of\n\nman, beast, bird or machine, or upon the result of a game . .\n\n.  .\"   This  is broad and encompassing language.   We do not\r                    \n\nthink that it  excludes the  placing of bets  on video  poker\n\ngames as a matter of statutory construction.   \n\n          Although there are  no Massachusetts cases directly\n\non point, there are three that indicate that betting on video\n\npoker  games violates   17.  In Commonwealth v. Club Caravan,\r                                                                         \n\nInc. (and  eighteen companion  cases), 571 N.E.2d  405 (Mass.\r                                                 \n\nApp. Ct.  1991), the court made  several significant rulings.\n\nIt  upheld the  ruling of the  trial judge that  \"play on the\n\nvideo  poker machines in question involved as a matter of law\n\nan  element  of  skill,  thus  qualifying  the  machines  for\n\nlicensure under Mass. Gen. L.  c. 140,   177 A(1) and  (2) as\n\nautomatic  amusement  devices.\"      Id. at  406.   The court\r                                                    \n\nexplained:\n\n             Since   the   video   poker   machines\n          involved   an   element   of  skill   and\n          ostensibly  paid  off  winners only  with\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          free games, the judge correctly dismissed\n          the  indictments  based solely  on having\n          such machines  on  hand for  the  use  of\n          patrons.  The  judge correctly ruled,  we\n          think,  that  licensed  machines so  used\n          were exempt not only  from G.L. c. 271,  \n          7,  this exemption being explicit in G.L.\n          c. 140,   177A(7),  but also from G.L. c.\n          271,     5 and  17, seemingly overlapping\n          statutes which in relevant  part prohibit\n          keeping  a place  for  gaming or  keeping\n          gaming apparatus.  The purpose of   177A,\n          to  legalize  and  license machines  that\n          utilize some element of skill and pay off\n          winners  only  with  free   games,  would\n          otherwise be thwarted.\n\nId.  at  407.     The  court  noted  that  the   trial  judge\r               \n\ndifferentiated between  video poker games and  \"actual use of\n\nthe  machines for gambling: i.e.,  paying off in money rather\n\nthan free games,\" id. and drew the following line:\r                                 \n\n          Where  a machine  was used  for gambling,\n          i.e.,  where  there  was  evidence  of  a\n          payoff  to  a customer,  the  judge ruled\n          that the machine, by the express terms of\n          G.L. c.  140,   177A(6), was in violation\n          of   that   statute   and   thus   lacked\n          protection from the  prohibitions of  the\n          gaming laws such as G.L. c. 271,    5, 7,\n          8, and 17.\n\nId. at 407-08.  The court explicitly refrained from ruling as\r               \n\nto the  applicability of    17 to  video poker machines.   It\n\nexplained:  \n\n             An argument was made by the defendants\n          below  that     17  was aimed  at  bookie\n          operations, i.e., registering of  bets on\n          contests such as horseracing, dog racing,\n          football   point  spreads,   or  numbers,\n          rather  than at  slot  machines or  other\n          gambling devices.  The argument, rejected\n          by the  judge, is  not  advanced in  this\n          appeal,  which concerns  only indictments\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          dismissed  by  the judge.   We  intend no\r                                                               \n          ruling as to the applicability of   17 to\r                                                               \n          video poker machines.\r                                          \n\nId. at 408 n.6.  (Emphasis added.)\r               \n\n          It was  held in  Commonwealth v. Boyle,  189 N.E.2d\r                                                            \n\n844, 846  (Mass. 1963) that, \"possession  of gaming apparatus\n\nanywhere is punishable\" and \"[t]he possession of any recorded\n\nmemorandum intended to be a minute of a bet is sufficient  to\n\ndemonstrate a violation of either Mass. Gen. L. c. 271   7 or\n\n17  or both of these sections, depending upon the contents of\n\nthe memorandum.\"\n\n          In  Commonwealth v.  Sousa, 600 N.E.2d  1012 (Mass.\r                                                \n\nApp. Ct. 1991),  the appeals court noted  that, registering a\n\nbet \"usually  connotes a  recording  or notation.\"   It  also\n\nstated:  \"One may 'register' a bet, however, by committing it\n\nto memory.\"  Id. at 1016.\r                            \n\n          We think there was sufficient evidence from which a\n\nreasonable  jury could find that a video poker machine was \"a\n\ndevice for  registering bets\"  within the  meaning  of    17.\n\nAfter  inserting  the  required  amount  of  money  into  the\n\nmachine,  the player  selected the  number  of credits  - the\n\namount he wanted to bet.  The machine \"registered\" the bet by\n\ndisplaying  the number of credits he had selected and set the\n\nodds on  winning the poker  hand dealt the player.   The bets\n\nhad to be registered by the machine so that the odds could be\n\nset.  Moreover, the bets had  to be registered on the machine\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nbecause  defendant and/or  his  employees  determined,  after\n\nopening the machine, the  amount of reimbursement for payouts\n\ndue the proprietors of  the establishments where the machines\n\nwere located.  And we think it could be reasonably found that\n\nthe  statute included  the defendant  as one  who sold  pools\n\n\"upon the result  of a trial  or contest of skill\"  . . .  or\n\n\"upon the result of a game.\" \n\n          We  rule, based on  the evidence, the  words of the\n\nstatute  and  Massachusetts case  law,  that  the jury  could\n\nlawfully find defendant violated Mass. Gen. L. ch. 271,   17.\n\n          Mass. General Laws ch. 271,   7 provides:\n\n            7.   Lotteries; disposal of property by\r                        7.

He\n\nacknowledges  that \"[a]  video poker  machine which  pays off\n\n'hits in cash can amount to a 'lottery' under   7.\"  Brief at\n\n31.  His argument is that it was not proven by the government\n\nthat chance  predominated over  skill in playing  video poker\n\nand therefore there was no lottery within the meaning of   7.\n\n          The Massachusetts law is  reasonably clear that for\n\nthere  to be a lottery, chance must predominate over skill in\n\nthe results of  the game, or  the element  of chance must  be\n\npresent in such  a manner as to thwart  the exercise of skill\n\nor  judgment in a game.   Commonwealth v.  Plissner, 4 N.E.2d\r                                                               \n\n241,  245  (Mass. 1936).   In  Commonwealth v.  Club Caravan,\r                                                                         \n\nInc.,  571 N.E.2d at 406, the appeals court held that play on\r                \n\nvideo  poker machines  \"involved as  [sic] matter  of law  an\n\nelement of skill.\"\n\n          The  government contends that  there was sufficient\n\nevidence  for the jury to find  that chance predominated over\n\nskill  in playing video poker.   Viewing the  evidence in the\n\nlight  most favorable to the government, we agree.  There was\n\ntestimony that  the machine  dealt the cards  electronically,\n\nalthough  a player could choose what cards to discard.  There\n\nwas testimony that winning depended on the cards dealt by the\n\nmachine.  A hand of video poker was played before the jury in\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nthe courtroom.  The jury could judge for themselves whether a\n\nsubstantial  element  of  chance  was involved.    There  was\n\ntestimony that one  hand of video poker took from  two to ten\n\nseconds to play.  Unless a player has a mind like a computer,\n\nthis  is hardly sufficient time to use poker skills.  Another\n\nfactor  that  the  jury  could  take  into  consideration  in\n\ndetermining  whether  video poker  was  a  game dominated  by\n\nchance  or   skill  was  the  profit   that  defendant  made.\n\nObviously, there  were a great many more losers than winners.\n\nSkill  might  have played  a role  in  the video  poker games\n\noperated by defendant, but it did not dominate.\n\n          We rule,  therefore, that  the jury lawfully  could\n\nfind defendant to have operated a lottery that was prohibited\n\nby chapter 271,   7 of the Massachusetts General Laws.\n\n         The Jury Instruction -- Waiver or Forfeiture\r                     The Jury Instruction -- Waiver or Forfeiture\r                                                                 \n\n          Defendant   claims  that   the   court   erred   in\n\ninstructing the  jury on the  Massachusetts statutes relative\n\nto  gambling by  refusing  to  read  the  statutes  in  their\n\nentirety  to the  jury.   There was  no objection  by defense\n\ncounsel.   Failure to  object to a  jury instruction  usually\n\nmeans that  our review is  conducted under the  \"plain error\"\n\ndoctrine.    In this  case,  however,  the government  argues\n\nstrenuously  that  defendant  waived  any  objection  to  the\n\ninstruction and  is, therefore, foreclosed  from arguing  the\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nissue  on appeal.  We  start our analysis  by rehearsing what\n\nhappened in the trial court.\n\n          At  the pre-charge  conference  the district  court\n\nstarted  to discuss  the  government's  instruction  request,\n\nnumber 38.  This request asked  that the texts of Mass.  Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 271,    7 and 17 be read in full to the jury.   Then\n\nfollowed this colloquy  between the court  and counsel.   The\n\nprosecutor is Tuteur; defense counsel is Duggan.\n\n             THE  COURT:    And,  we  will go  into\n          Government's 38.\n             And, I don't think  I am going to give\n          this law in the description of Section 17\n          and 19.  What I would be inclined to tell\n          them is the following  -- and, I think it\n          may be the end of the Government's 38.\n             MR. TUTEUR:  38-A as well.\n             THE  COURT:   Well, I  am inclined  to\n          tell them just what is the last paragraph\n          of  Government *38.   You  are instructed\n          that  the video  poker machines  are used\n          for amusement purposes  only by  offering\n          nothing more than the opportunity  to win\n          games.    However,   when  the   evidence\n          indicates beyond a  reasonable doubt,  or\n          proves  beyond  a  reasonable doubt  that\n          video   poker   machines  are   used  for\n          gambling, that is, where cash payoffs are\n          given,  then  Massachusetts law  has been\n          violated.  Okay?\n             MR. TUTEUR:   Can I back  the Court up\n          for  just  a  minute.    On  the  illegal\n          gambling business, is the  Court inclined\n          to  give  an instruction  regarding gross\n          revenue?\n             THE  COURT:   Right.   I  am going  to\n          cover that.  I am going to cover 38(a) on\n          licensing  and  basically tell  them what\n          they want to hear.  And, I think on these\n          stipulations  tomorrow  that they  should\n          not focus  on the license but  on whether\n          the  evidence proves  they were  used for\n          gambling.\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n             MR.  DUGGAN:   Back  on  38  where the\n          General Laws,  Massachusetts General Laws\n          271 and 17 is  cited, and the notion that\n          the  statute is  violated where  one with\n          the intent to --\n             THE COURT:  I just told you, I am not.\n          I  mean*,  if it  is  true,  if the  last\n          paragraph of their 38  is true,2 I am not\n          going to  tell them what 271  and 17 say.\n          I think it is just tremendously confusing\n          in the context of this case.  Okay?\n             MR. DUGGAN:  Yes.\n             THE  COURT:  I mean  the key is:  Have\n          they  proved  beyond  a reasonable  doubt\n          that they are used for gambling, that you\n          get money  for games?   That is  a crime,\n          there  is no dispute  under state  law on\n          that.  The rest of this stuff is just --\n\n          It  is  the  government's contention  that  defense\n\ncounsel's  (Duggan)  answer \"Yes\"  to  the  court's question,\n\n\"Okay?\"  was an  acceptance and  approval of  the instruction\n\nand, therefore, he cannot raise the issue on appeal.\n\n          The   most   authoritative  case   on   waiver  and\n\nforfeiture under Fed. R.  Crim. P. 52(b) is United  States v.\r                                                                      \n\nOlano, 113 S. Ct. 1770 (1993).  The Court pointed out:\r                 \n\n             Waiver  is different  from forfeiture.\n          Whereas forfeiture is the failure to make\n          the  timely assertion of  a right, waiver\n          is  the  \"intentional  relinquishment  or\n          abandonment of  a  known right.\"  .  .  .\n          Whether a particular  right is  waivable;\n          whether  the  defendant must  participate\n          personally in the waiver; whether certain\n          procedures are required  for waiver;  and\n          whether  the  defendant's choice  must be\n          particularly  informed or  voluntary, all\n          depend on the right at stake. . . .  Mere\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  The last  paragraph of government's request  number 38 is\nnot  in the  record.   We do  not think  it is  necessary for\nunderstanding the issue.\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          forfeiture,  as  opposed to  waiver, does\n          not  extinguish  an  \"error\"  under  Rule\n          52(b). .  .  .    If  a  legal  rule  was\n          violated   during   the  District   Court\n          proceedings, and if the defendant did not\n          waive the  rule, then  there has  been an\n          \"error\"  within the meaning of Rule 52(b)\n          despite   the   absence   of   a   timely\n          objection.\n\nId. at 1777 (citations and quotations omitted).\r               \n\n          Our survey of the cases in this esoteric procedural\n\ncorner of the federal law convinces us that defendant did not\n\nwaive  the issue.   In United States v.  Lakich, 23 F.3d 1203\r                                                           \n\n(7th  Cir. 1994), counsel had overnight to think how the jury\n\nshould  be  instructed  in  response to  its  question  about\n\nentrapment.   The  next  morning the  court, after  eliciting\n\ncomments from counsel, read its proposed instruction to them.\n\nBoth counsel  explicitly agreed  to the  court's instruction.\n\nThe  court of  appeals  held that  under these  circumstances\n\ndefendant had waived  any objections to the instruction.  Id.\r                                                                         \n\nat 207-08.  \n\n          Lakich is a far  cry from the  case before us.   In\r                            \n\nthe instant case the court cut off defense counsel's question\n\nbefore  it was finished.   It is difficult  to determine just\n\nwhat defense counsel was going  to ask, particularly in light\n\nof the fact  that it  was the government  that requested  the\n\nMassachusetts statutes be read in their entirety to the jury.\n\nFor  aught we know, defense counsel  was simply agreeing that\n\nthe statutes  were  confusing.   Or  perhaps  he  thought  it\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nprudent  to simply say, \"Yes\" and move  on.  In any event, we\n\nthink the attempted colloquy between  defense counsel and the\n\ncourt is too thin a peg on which to hang a finding of waiver.\n\n          This case clearly does not fall within the ambit of\n\nwaiver resulting from a tactical decision not to object.  See\r                                                                         \n\nUnited  States v. Mihm, 13  F.3d 1200, 1204  (8th Cir. 1994);\r                                  \n\nUnited States v. Coonan, 938 F.2d 1553, 1561 (2d Cir. 1991).\r                                   \n\n          We  are also reluctant  to find  a waiver  in these\n\ncircumstances because the cases  in our own circuit send  out\n\nconflicting signals.   In United States  v. Rojo-Alvarez, 944\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d  959, 971  (1st Cir.  1991), we  held that  there was  a\n\nwaiver  when,  after the  court  reworded  an instruction  in\n\nresponse to defendant's objection,  defense counsel stated he\n\nwas satisfied  with the reworded instruction.   Even assuming\n\nthat this is  the law of  the circuit,3 there  was no  direct\n\ninquiry from the court in the instant case nor an unequivocal\n\nassent  to the instruction by defense counsel.  There are two\n\nprior  cases in  this circuit  that  cut the  other way.   In\n\nUnited  States v. Espinal, 757 F.2d 423, 426 (1st Cir. 1985),\r                                     \n\nwe  held:  \"When  a charge is given  as requested by counsel,\n\nthe  defects, if any, must  rise to the  level of plain error\n\naffecting substantial rights  in order to justify  reversal.\"\n\nThere was no mention of waiver.  In United States v. Drougas,\r                                                                        \n\n748  F.2d 8,  30  (1st  Cir.  1984),  we  held  that  defense\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  Rojo-Alvarez was not an en banc opinion.\r                                               \n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\ncounsel's  explicit  approval  of  an  instruction  bars  any\n\nobjection  except upon the grounds of plain error.  These two\n\ncases appear to  be somewhat  at odds with  United States  v.\r                                                                     \n\nKakley,  741 F.2d  1,  3 (1st  Cir.  1984), which  held  that\r                  \n\nrequesting an  instruction that is given  amounts to \"invited\n\nerror,\"  and whatever  error  occurred may  not be  raised on\n\nappeal.   All  of  the cases  cited  in this  paragraph  were\n\ndecided prior to Olano.   This panel regards the  question as\r                                  \n\nopen.\n\n          Because of  the uncertainty as  to whether  defense\n\ncounsel had explicitly approved  the instruction and in light\n\nof the conflicting  decisions of this circuit,  we decline to\n\nfinda waiverhere. We, therefore,turn toa plainerror analysis.\n\n          United States v. Olano,  113 S. Ct. 1770, considers\r                                            \n\nin detail the doctrine of plain error under Fed. R.  Crim. P.\n\n52(b).   Its teaching may be capsulized as follows:  \"'Plain'\n\nis synonymous with 'clear' or, equivalently, 'obvious.'\"  Id.\r                                                                         \n\nat 1777.  The requirement of Rule 52(b) that the error affect\n\nsubstantial  rights  \"means that  the  error  must have  been\n\nprejudicial:    It must  have  affected  the  outcome of  the\n\nDistrict  Court proceedings.\"  Id. at 1778.  And \"[i]t is the\r                                              \n\ndefendant rather than the Government who bears the burden  of\n\npersuasion with respect to prejudice.\"  Id.

The standard  that guides the correction  of a\r               \n\nplain error  is whether  the error \"'seriously  affect[s] the\n\nfairness,   integrity  or   public  reputation   of  judicial\n\nproceedings.'\"   Id.

In his  reply brief, defendant raises  a belated argument\nthat   we  should  apply   an  unspecified  \"more  favorable\"\nreviewing  standard   in  assessing  his  challenge   to  the\nstructuring conviction.  In  defendant's view, his failure to\nobject to the structuring instructions given at his trial was\nexcusable  because Ratzlaf had  not yet been  handed down and\r                                      \nbecause all of the circuits which had then issued opinions on\nthe meaning of the term \"willful\" in the context of the anti-\nstructuring  statute had  defined it  in a  manner consistent\nwith  the district  court's  instructions.   Thus,  defendant\ncontends,  the  law  \"did  not  support  a  request  for  the\ninstruction later mandated in Ratzlaf.\"\r                                                 \n          Even  if we were to  view this argument as properly\nbefore us, cf.

At the time  of defendant's trial, settled law\nin this  circuit foreshadowed the Supreme  Court's conclusion\nin Ratzlaf  that a conviction for  structuring requires proof\r                      \nthat  defendant acted  with  knowledge that  his conduct  was\nunlawful.

The instructions were not tantamount to\n\ncharging  that in order to  convict, the jury  must find that\n\ndefendant knew that acting to evade the reporting requirement\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nwas  unlawful.6     The   absence  of  such   an  instruction\n\nconstitutes a clear violation  of the defendant's due process\n\nright to have the prosecution persuade the fact-finder beyond\n\na reasonable  doubt of the facts necessary  to establish each\r                                                                         \n\nelement  of   the  offense  charged,  and  defendant's  Sixth\r                   \n\nAmendment  right to a jury trial.

While  the  general  willfulness  instruction\nstated that the defendant  had to have acted in  violation of\nsome known legal duty, it does not explicitly inform the jury\nthat  the defendant had  to know that  structuring itself was\nillegal.  Furthermore,  by indicating that  willfulness means\nsomething  different  in  the  structuring  and  tax  evasion\ncontexts  (the  latter  of  which  differs  from  most  other\ncriminal law  areas by requiring specific  knowledge that the\nconduct at issue was criminal), the jury could  have inferred\nthat the actual  knowledge of illegality required in  the tax\nevasion context was not required in the structuring context.\r                                   \n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nthe  second and  third prerequisites  to reversal  under Rule\n\n52(b) --  i.e.,  whether the  error  was plain  and  affected\n\ndefendant's  substantial  rights  --  are  considerably  more\n\ncomplicated.   Although   the  challenged   instructions  are\n\nclearly  incorrect  in  light  of Ratzlaf,  Ratzlaf  was  not\r                                                               \n\ndecided  at the  time  of defendant's  trial.   Moreover, the\n\ngreat weight of then-existing authority indicated that actual\n\nknowledge of  the illegality of structuring  by the defendant\n\nwas  not a precondition to  conviction.  See  Ratzlaf, 114 S.\r                                                                 \n\nCt. at 665  (collecting cases).   Thus, this  case raises  an\n\nissue that the Olano court explicitly reserved:  \"We need not\r                                \n\nconsider  the special case where the error was unclear at the\n\ntime  of  trial  but  becomes  clear  on  appeal  because the\n\napplicable law has  been clarified.\"   Olano, 113  S.

Olano made clear that  substantial rights have\r                                \n\nbeen  affected  only  where   there  has  been  prejudice  to\n\ndefendant, and  then confirmed that the  Rule 52(b) prejudice\n\ninquiry  is  indistinguishable from  ordinary, harmless-error\n\nreview except for the fact  that the burden of proof  is upon\n\nthe  defendant.   113  S.

In the  present\n\ncontext,  this gives  rise  to a  problem we  recently noted:\n\ncontemporary  Supreme Court cases  suggest two separate modes\n\nof harmless-error  analysis where  the challenged error  is a\n\njury instruction that misdefines (or omits) an element of the\n\noffense  charged.

Ct. at  663 n.19.   Here, any claim  of\r                        \n\nlack of knowledge  of the illegality of  structuring tends to\n\nbe  belied by defendant's conduct.   The evidence shows that,\n\non  February 18, 1987,  defendant's then-wife,  Lynne Marder,\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nacting at  defendant's behest, used cash  to purchase $11,460\n\nworth of cashier's  checks in amounts of $5,000,  $3,960, and\n\n$2,500  from three  separate banks  in Derry,  New Hampshire.\n\nWhile it certainly would make sense for a person cognizant of\n\nthe reporting  requirement but  unaware of the  illegality of\n\nstructuring to  make two  separate purchases at  two separate\r                                    \n\nbanks -- e.g., a purchase of $5,000 and a purchase of  $6,460\n\n--  in order to obtain $11,460 without triggering a report to\n\nthe  IRS, the fact that defendant instructed his wife to make\n\nthree  separate purchases  at  three separate  banks suggests\r                 \n\nthat  defendant had a purpose beyond evasion of the reporting\n\nrequirement:  concealment  of his structuring.   And proof of\n\nconcealment  tends to  prove  knowledge of  illegality.   See\r                                                                         \n\nUnited  States v.

While  the\n\nevidence of the omitted element is certainly less strong here\n\nthan  it was  in  Whiting,  see  Whiting,  28  F.3d  at  1309\r                                                    \n\n(documenting the overwhelming record evidence that the weapon\n\nin  question was indeed a \"firearm\" within the meaning of the\n\nstatute),  it  is,  as  we  have  noted,  not  insubstantial.\n\nFurthermore, the  error here was  far more excusable  than in\n\nWhiting.  At the time the  defective instructions were given,\r                   \n\nthey were  in accord with the  law of every circuit  that had\n\nissued  an opinion  on  the meaning  of the  anti-structuring\n\nstatute's  willfulness provision.

See United States  v.

The combined length\n          of the sentences (\"total  punishment\") is\n          determined   by  the   adjusted  combined\n          offense level.   To the extent  possible,\n          the total punishment is  to be imposed on\n          each count.  Sentences on all counts  run\n          concurrently,   except  as   required  to\n          achieve   the   total  sentence,   or  as\n          required by law.\n\n             This   section  applies   to  multiple\n          counts of conviction (1) contained in the\n          same  indictment  or information,  or (2)\n          contained  in  different  indictments  or\n          informations for which  sentences are  to\n          be  imposed  at the  same  time  or in  a\n          consolidated proceeding.\n\n             Usually,  at least  one of  the counts\n          will have a statutory maximum adequate to\n          permit imposition of the total punishment\n          as the  sentence  on  that  count.    The\n          sentence on each of the other counts will\n          then  be set  at  a lesser  of the  total\n          punishment  and the  applicable statutory\n          maximum, and be  made to run concurrently\n          with all or part of the longest sentence.\n          If no count carries an adequate statutory\n          maximum, consecutive sentences are  to be\n          imposed  to  the   extent  necessary   to\n          achieve the total punishment.\n\n          The district  court sentenced the defendant  to 140\n\nmonths incarceration, which was in accord with the Guidelines\n\nSentencing Range, on his RICO and Money Laundering counts (1,\n\n2, 4-10), \"to  be served  concurrently on each  other.\"   The\n\nbalance of the sentence was as follows:\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\n          120 months on each  of counts 19 &amp;  20 to\n          be served  concurrently on each  other as\n          well as on counts 1, 2, 4-10;\n          60 months on each  of counts 3,11,12, 16-\n          18,  to be  served  concurrently on  each\n          other as  well as on counts  1,2,4-10 and\n          counts 19 &amp; 20.\n\n          Defendant does  not object to the overall sentence.\n\nHe does argue that the court erred  in imposing a sentence of\n\n120 months on  Counts 19 &amp; 20 (conspiracy  to defraud the IRS\n\nand structuring) and 60 months on Counts 16-18 (tax evasion).\n\nIn his reply brief  defendant acknowledges that the sentences\n\non  Counts 16-18  \"lawfully  reached the  statutory  maximum\"\n\nbecause  of  the  provisions   of  U.S.S.G.   5G1.2  and  its\n\ncommentary.   He therefore  concedes that  his attack  on the\n\nsentences on counts  16-18 is contingent  on reversal of  the\n\njudgment  on those  counts carrying  the 140-month  sentence.\n\nBecause this contingency has not occurred, the attack  on the\n\nsentences for counts 16-18 fails.\n\n          As the  government points out,  however, the  court\n\nerred in sentencing defendant to a concurrent sentence of 120\n\nmonths  on  Count 19  for  conspiring to  defraud  the United\n\nStates.   The applicable  statute, 18 U.S.C.    371, provides\n\nfor  a fine of not  more than $10,000  or imprisonment of not\n\nmore  than five years, or both.  Defendant's sentence on this\n\ncount should have been a concurrent sentence of sixty months.\n\nWe must  remand to the district court for a correction of the\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\nsentence on Count 19.

ILLEGAL GAMBLING UNDER THE MASSACHUSETTS STATUTES</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Defendant owned and operated the Revere Amusement Company (\"Revere\") from 1981 to 1989. Revere's income came from the operation of video poker machines that were placed in an assortment of bars, taverns, and social clubs in Revere, Massachusetts. The poker machines operated somewhat like slot machines. The machine was activated by inserting money into it, at least a quarter. The player would then manipulate a button to obtain a poker hand. The machine's video screen would display five cards representing a poker hand. Before the \"play\" began, the screen displayed the payoffs for winning hands; i.e., a hand consisting of three of a kind might pay twelve to one. Credits were given for winning hands. For example, a full house might pay ten credits. After a winning player finished playing the machine, he exchanged his credits for cash. The cash payment was made by the person in charge of the establishment in which the machine(s) was located. Defendant and/or his employees visited the approximately seventeen places where the poker machines were located on a regular basis, usually daily. The proprietors of the establishments were reimbursed for the payoffs and then the machine's proceeds were split with them. Normally, no records were kept of the transactions. And, of course, only defendant and his employees had access to the monies paid into the poker machine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>In 1985 defendant decided to enjoy the fruits of his profitable business and moved to Palm Springs, California. Defendant's son, Steven, then took over the daily operation of Revere.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Defendant, however, kept a tight reign on Revere's operations from Palm Springs. He received between $4,000 to $10,000 in cash by express mail several times a week. At irregular intervals, he asked his employees to keep records of the transactions so he would know what was going on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Revere's income from the poker machines amounted to about $500,000 per year. There was convincing evidence that defendant made regular payoffs to local police officers, politicians, and organized crime. Neither defendant nor his company paid state or federal income tax on the income generated by the video poker game machines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>With this factual background, we turn to the question of whether defendant's poker game business violated the implicated Massachusetts statutes. This is, of course, primarily a question of Massachusetts law. And there is no Massachusetts case directly on point. We first consider Mass. Gen. L. ch. 271, &#167; 17, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>&#167; 17.

(Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>We note first that the statute is not limited to bookmaking in the traditional sense. It includes \"any device for registering bets, or buying or selling pools, upon the result of a trial or contest of skill, speed or endurance of man, beast, bird or machine, or upon the result of a game . . . .\" This is broad and encompassing language. We do not think that it excludes the placing of bets on video poker games as a matter of statutory construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>Although there are no Massachusetts cases directly on point, there are three that indicate that betting on video poker games violates &#167; 17. In Commonwealth v. Club Caravan, Inc. (and eighteen companion cases), 30 Mass. App. Ct. 561, 571 N.E.2d 405 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991), the court made several significant rulings. It upheld the ruling of the trial Judge that \"play on the video poker machines in question involved as a matter of law an element of skill, thus qualifying the machines for licensure under Mass. Gen. L. c. 140, &#167; 177 A(1) and (2) as automatic amusement devices.\" Id. at 406. The court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>Since the video poker machines involved an element of skill and ostensibly paid off winners only with free games, the Judge correctly dismissed the indictments based solely on having such machines on hand for the use of patrons. The Judge correctly ruled, we think, that licensed machines so used were exempt not only from G.L. c. 271, &#167; 7, this exemption being explicit in G.L. c. 140, &#167; 177A(7), but also from G.L. c. 271, &#167;&#167; 5 and 17, seemingly overlapping statutes which in relevant part prohibit keeping a place for gaming or keeping gaming apparatus. The purpose of &#167; 177A, to legalize and license machines that utilize some element of skill and pay off winners only with free games, would otherwise be thwarted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>Id. at 407. The court noted that the trial Judge differentiated between video poker games and \"actual use of the machines for gambling: i.e., paying off in money rather than free games,\" id. and drew the following line:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>Where a machine was used for gambling, i.e., where there was evidence of a payoff to a customer, the Judge ruled that the machine, by the express terms of G.L. c. 140, &#167; 177A(6), was in violation of that statute and thus lacked protection from the prohibitions of the gaming laws such as G.L. c. 271, &#167;&#167; 5, 7, 8, and 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>Id. at 407-08. The court explicitly refrained from ruling as to the applicability of &#167; 17 to video poker machines. It explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>An argument was made by the defendants below that &#167; 17 was aimed at bookie operations, i.e., registering of bets on contests such as horseracing, dog racing, football point spreads, or numbers, rather than at slot machines or other gambling devices. The argument, rejected by the Judge, is not advanced in this appeal, which concerns only indictments dismissed by the Judge. We intend no ruling as to the applicability of &#167; 17 to video poker machines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Id. at 408 n.6. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>It was held in Commonwealth v. Boyle, 346 Mass. 1, 189 N.E.2d 844, 846 (Mass. 1963) that, \"possession of gaming apparatus anywhere is punishable\" and \"the possession of any recorded memorandum intended to be a minute of a bet is sufficient to demonstrate a violation of either Mass. Gen. L. c. 271 &#167; 7 or 17 or both of these sections, depending upon the contents of the memorandum.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>In Commonwealth v. Sousa, 33 Mass. App. Ct. 433, 600 N.E.2d 1012 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991), the appeals court noted that, registering a bet \"usually connotes a recording or notation.\" It also stated: \"One may 'register' a bet, however, by committing it to memory.\" Id. at 1016.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>We think there was sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that a video poker machine was \"a device for registering bets\" within the meaning of &#167; 17. After inserting the required amount of money into the machine, the player selected the number of credits - the amount he wanted to bet. The machine \"registered\" the bet by displaying the number of credits he had selected and set the odds on winning the poker hand dealt the player. The bets had to be registered by the machine so that the odds could be set. Moreover, the bets had to be registered on the machine because defendant and/or his employees determined, after opening the machine, the amount of reimbursement for payouts due the proprietors of the establishments where the machines were located. And we think it could be reasonably found that the statute included the defendant as one who sold pools \"upon the result of a trial or contest of skill\" . . . or \"upon the result of a game.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>We rule, based on the evidence, the words of the statute and Massachusetts case law, that the jury could lawfully find defendant violated Mass. Gen. L. ch. 271, &#167; 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Mass. General Laws ch. 271, &#167; 7 provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>&#167; 7. Lotteries; disposal of property by chance</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>Whoever sets up or promotes a lottery for money or other property of value, or by way of lottery disposes of any property of value, or under the pretext of a sale, gift or delivery of other property or of any right, privilege or thing whatever disposes of or offers or attempts to dispose of any property, with intent to make the disposal thereof dependent upon or connected with chance by lot, dice, numbers, game, hazard or other gambling device, whereby such chance or device is made an additional inducement to the disposal or sale of said property, and whoever aids either by printing or writing, or is in any way concerned, in the setting up, managing or drawing of such lottery, or in such disposal or offer or attempt to dispose of property by such chance or device, shall be punished by a fine of not more than three thousand dollars or by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than three years, or in jail or the house of correction for not more than two and one half years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>Defendant's attack on &#167; 7 takes a different approach than his doesn't-apply challenge to &#167; 17. He acknowledges that \"[a] video poker machine which pays off 'hits in cash can amount to a 'lottery' under &#167; 7.\" Brief at 31. His argument is that it was not proven by the government that chance predominated over skill in playing video poker and therefore there was no lottery within the meaning of &#167; 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>The Massachusetts law is reasonably clear that for there to be a lottery, chance must predominate over skill in the results of the game, or the element of chance must be present in such a manner as to thwart the exercise of skill or judgment in a game. Commonwealth v. Plissner, 295 Mass. 457, 4 N.E.2d 241, 245 (Mass. 1936). In Commonwealth v. Club Caravan, Inc., 571 N.E.2d at 406, the appeals court held that play on video poker machines \"involved as [sic] matter of law an element of skill.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>The government contends that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that chance predominated over skill in playing video poker. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we agree. There was testimony that the machine dealt the cards electronically, although a player could choose what cards to discard. There was testimony that winning depended on the cards dealt by the machine. A hand of video poker was played before the jury in the courtroom. The jury could Judge for themselves whether a substantial element of chance was involved. There was testimony that one hand of video poker took from two to ten seconds to play. Unless a player has a mind like a computer, this is hardly sufficient time to use poker skills. Another factor that the jury could take into consideration in determining whether video poker was a game dominated by chance or skill was the profit that defendant made. Obviously, there were a great many more losers than winners. Skill might have played a role in the video poker games operated by defendant, but it did not dominate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>We rule, therefore, that the jury lawfully could find defendant to have operated a lottery that was prohibited by chapter 271, &#167; 7 of the Massachusetts General Laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>The Jury Instruction -- Waiver or Forfeiture</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>Defendant claims that the court erred in instructing the jury on the Massachusetts statutes relative to gambling by refusing to read the statutes in their entirety to the jury. There was no objection by defense counsel. Failure to object to a jury instruction usually means that our review is conducted under the \"plain error\" doctrine. In this case, however, the government argues strenuously that defendant waived any objection to the instruction and is, therefore, foreclosed from arguing the issue on appeal. We start our analysis by rehearsing what happened in the trial court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>At the pre-charge conference the district court started to discuss the government's instruction request, number 38. This request asked that the texts of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 271, &#167;&#167; 7 and 17 be read in full to the jury. Then followed this colloquy between the court and counsel. The prosecutor is Tuteur; defense counsel is Duggan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>THE COURT: And, we will go into Government's 38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>And, I don't think I am going to give this law in the description of Section 17 and 19.

You are instructed that the video poker machines are used for amusement purposes only by offering nothing more than the opportunity to win games. However, when the evidence indicates beyond a reasonable doubt, or proves beyond a reasonable doubt that video poker machines are used for gambling, that is, where cash payoffs are given, then Massachusetts law has been violated. Okay?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>MR. TUTEUR: Can I back the Court up for just a minute.

I am going to cover that. I am going to cover 38(a) on licensing and basically tell them what they want to hear.

That is a crime, there is no dispute under state law on that. The rest of this stuff is just --</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>It is the government's contention that defense counsel's (Duggan) answer \"Yes\" to the court's question, \"Okay?\" was an acceptance and approval of the instruction and, therefore, he cannot raise the issue on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>The most authoritative case on waiver and forfeiture under Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b) is United States v. Olano, 123 L. Ed. 2d 508, 113 S. Ct. 1770 (1993). The Court pointed out:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>Waiver is different from forfeiture. Whereas forfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right, waiver is the \"intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\" . . . Whether a particular right is waivable; whether the defendant must participate personally in the waiver; whether certain procedures are required for waiver; and whether the defendant's choice must be particularly informed or voluntary, all depend on the right at stake. . . . Mere forfeiture, as opposed to waiver, does not extinguish an \"error\" under Rule 52(b). . . . If a legal rule was violated during the District Court proceedings, and if the defendant did not waive the rule, then there has been an \"error\" within the meaning of Rule 52(b) despite the absence of a timely objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>Id. at 1777 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>Our survey of the cases in this esoteric procedural corner of the federal law convinces us that defendant did not waive the issue. In United States v. Lakich, 23 F.3d 1203 (7th Cir. 1994), counsel had overnight to think how the jury should be instructed in response to its question about entrapment. The next morning the court, after eliciting comments from counsel, read its proposed instruction to them. Both counsel explicitly agreed to the court's instruction. The court of appeals held that under these circumstances defendant had waived any objections to the instruction. Id. at 207-08.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>Lakich is a far cry from the case before us. In the instant case the court cut off defense counsel's question before it was finished. It is difficult to determine just what defense counsel was going to ask, particularly in light of the fact that it was the government that requested the Massachusetts statutes be read in their entirety to the jury. For aught we know, defense counsel was simply agreeing that the statutes were confusing. Or perhaps he thought it prudent to simply say, \"Yes\" and move on. In any event, we think the attempted colloquy between defense counsel and the court is too thin a peg on which to hang a finding of waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>This case clearly does not fall within the ambit of waiver resulting from a tactical decision not to object. See United States v. Mihm, 13 F.3d 1200, 1204 (8th Cir. 1994); United States v. Coonan, 938 F.2d 1553, 1561 (2d Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>We are also reluctant to find a waiver in these circumstances because the cases in our own circuit send out conflicting signals. In United States v. Rojo-Alvarez, 944 F.2d 959, 971 (1st Cir. 1991), we held that there was a waiver when, after the court reworded an instruction in response to defendant's objection, defense counsel stated he was satisfied with the reworded instruction. Even assuming that this is the law of the circuit,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> there was no direct inquiry from the court in the instant case nor an unequivocal assent to the instruction by defense counsel. There are two prior cases in this circuit that cut the other way. In United States v. Espinal, 757 F.2d 423, 426 (1st Cir. 1985), we held: \"When a charge is given as requested by counsel, the defects, if any, must rise to the level of plain error affecting substantial rights in order to justify reversal.\" There was no mention of waiver. In United States v. Drougas, 748 F.2d 8, 30 (1st Cir. 1984), we held that defense counsel's explicit approval of an instruction bars any objection except upon the grounds of plain error. These two cases appear to be somewhat at odds with United States v. Kakley, 741 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1984), which held that requesting an instruction that is given amounts to \"invited error,\" and whatever error occurred may not be raised on appeal. All of the cases cited in this paragraph were decided prior to Olano. This panel regards the question as open.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>Because of the uncertainty as to whether defense counsel had explicitly approved the instruction and in light of the conflicting decisions of this circuit, we decline to find a waiver here. We, therefore, turn to a plain error analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>United States v. Olano, 123 L. Ed. 2d 508, 113 S. Ct. 1770, considers in detail the doctrine of plain error under Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b). Its teaching may be capsulized as follows: \"'Plain' is synonymous with 'clear' or, equivalently, 'obvious.'\" Id. at 1777. The requirement of Rule 52(b) that the error affect substantial rights \"means that the error must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the District Court proceedings.\" Id. at 1778. And \"it is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\" Id. Correcting plain error should be made where \"a miscarriage of Justice would otherwise result.\" This \"means that the defendant is actually innocent . . . but we have never held that a Rule 52(b) remedy is only warranted in cases of actual innocence.\" Id. at 1779. The standard that guides the correction of a plain error is whether the error \"'seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.'\" Id. (quoting United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 160, 80 L. Ed. 555, 56 S. Ct. 391 (1936)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>In United States v. Whiting, 28 F.3d 1296, 1309 (1st Cir. 1994), we assumed that the error affected substantial rights, but found that the error neither caused a miscarriage of Justice nor seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p>We need not go that far at this juncture. We have carefully reviewed the trial record and find that the district court's refusal to read the full text of each statute did not rise to the level of plain error because it did not affect the outcome of the trial. It was not prejudicial and did not affect substantial rights as those terms are defined in Olano. This ruling is not intended to suggest that the instruction as given was error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE ILLEGAL STRUCTURING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>Defendant asserts error in his conviction under 31 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5322(b) and 5324(c), which proscribe the structuring of currency transactions to evade the regulatory and statutory requirement that banks report to the IRS all currency transactions in amounts greater than or equal to $10,000. Citing Ratzlaf v. United States, 126 L. Ed. 2d 615, 114 S. Ct. 655 (1994), which held that conviction under these statutes requires proof \"that the defendant acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful,\" id. at 657 (interpreting meaning of statutory term \"willful\"), defendant argues that the instructions given at his trial did not require the jury to make the elemental determination that he knew the structuring in which he was engaged was unlawful in order to convict him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Conceding that he did not interpose a contemporaneous objection at trial, defendant contends that the erroneous instructions constitute plain error, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b), and require reversal of his structuring conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p>In light of the teaching of Ratzlaf, we think it clear that error was committed here. The willfulness requirement of &#167;&#167; 5322 and 5324 demands a jury finding that the defendant knew that the structuring in which he was engaged was unlawful. See Ratzlaf, 114 S. Ct. at 663. Defendant's jury was not, however, instructed to make this elemental determination in order to convict. In relevant part, the trial court instructed the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>To prove this offense the Government has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew each [of the banks] are required to file a currency transaction report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>A person structures a transaction if he . . . intended to evade the requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>The Government has to prove . . . this was done willfully, that is, that the defendant knew of the reporting requirement and that the structuring had the purpose of evading that requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p>Finally, the Government has to prove that the defendant in the process of structuring this transaction . . . was also violating another law of the United States in connection with that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>Thus, the jury was told that conviction was proper if it found that defendant knew of the reporting requirement, acted to evade it, and violated some other law of the United States in so acting. The instructions were not tantamount to charging that in order to convict, the jury must find that defendant knew that acting to evade the reporting requirement was unlawful.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The absence of such an instruction constitutes a clear violation of the defendant's due process right to have the prosecution persuade the fact-finder beyond a reasonable doubt of the facts necessary to establish each element of the offense charged, and defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. Sullivan v. Louisiana, 124 L. Ed. 2d 182, 113 S. Ct. 2078, 2080-81 (1993) (collecting cases) (the Sixth Amendment jury-trial right carries within it a right to have the jury find, beyond a reasonable doubt, all of the facts necessary to establish each element of the offense charged).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>While the question whether error occurred here is rather easily answered in hindsight, the questions whether the second and third prerequisites to reversal under Rule 52(b) -i.e., whether the error was plain and affected defendant's substantial rights -- are considerably more complicated. Although the challenged instructions are clearly incorrect in light of Ratzlaf, Ratzlaf was not decided at the time of defendant's trial. Moreover, the great weight of then-existing authority indicated that actual knowledge of the illegality of structuring by the defendant was not a precondition to conviction. See Ratzlaf, 114 S. Ct. at 665 (collecting cases). Thus, this case raises an issue that the Olano court explicitly reserved: \"We need not consider the special case where the error was unclear at the time of trial but becomes clear on appeal because the applicable law has been clarified.\" Olano, 113 S. Ct. at 1777; but see United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 163, 71 L. Ed. 2d 816, 102 S. Ct. 1584 (1982) (\"By its terms, recourse may be had to [Rule 52(b)] only on appeal from a trial infected with error so 'plain' the trial Judge and prosecutor were derelict in countenancing it, even absent defendant's timely assistance in detecting it.\") (dictum) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>This issue has engendered a split in the circuits since the Olano decision. Compare, e.g., United States v. Calverley, 37 F.3d 160, 162-63 (5th Cir. 1994) (en banc) (error must be clear or obvious at time of trial); United States v. Washington, 304 U.S. App. D.C. 263, 12 F.3d 1128, 1138 (D.C. Cir.) (same), cert. denied, 130 L. Ed. 2d 47, 115 S. Ct. 98 (1994); with United States v. Viola, 35 F.3d 37, 42 (2d Cir. 1994) (Rule 52(b) can be invoked even where the error was not clear or obvious at the time it was committed); United States v. Retos, 25 F.3d 1220, 1230 (3d Cir. 1994) (same); United States v. Jones, 21 F.3d 165, 172 (7th Cir. 1994) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p>In addition, the question whether the error affected the defendant's substantial rights is not without controversy. Olano made clear that substantial rights have been affected only where there has been prejudice to defendant, and then confirmed that the Rule 52(b) prejudice inquiry is indistinguishable from ordinary, harmless-error review except for the fact that the burden of proof is upon the defendant. 113 S. Ct. at 1777-78. In the present context, this gives rise to a problem we recently noted: contemporary Supreme Court cases suggest two separate modes of harmless-error analysis where the challenged error is a jury instruction that misdefines (or omits) an element of the offense charged. Whiting, 28 F.3d at 1309 and n.12 (collecting cases). One mode would look to whether there was sufficient record evidence to establish the unfound element; the other would look only to whether the jury made findings functionally equivalent to the missing finding. Id. ; see also Ortiz v. Dubois, 19 F.3d 708, 717-18 (1st Cir. 1994) (Stahl, J., Dissenting) (explicating latter inquiry in the habeas context), cert. denied, S. Ct. (U.S., Jan. 9, 1995) (No. 94-5650). As one might imagine, the determination of harmlessness vel non is often different under these two modes of analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p>Neither of these two issues need be resolved in this case. Even if we find that the error here was plain and affected defendant's substantial rights, we may not respond to it unless it \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" Olano, 123 L. Ed. 2d 508, 113 S. Ct. 1778-1779. In this case, we think that the error cannot be viewed as having seriously compromised any of these three values.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>First, there is relatively little risk that the error resulted in the miscarriage of Justice engendered by the conviction of an innocent man. Olano, 113 S. Ct. at 1779. Although there is no direct evidence in the record that defendant knew of the illegality of structuring, we previously have recognized that willfulness, as a state of mind, can rarely be proved by such evidence; instead, \"it is usually established by drawing reasonable inferences from the available facts.\" Bank of New England, 821 F.2d at 854; see also Ratzlaf, 114 S. Ct. at 663 n.19. Here, any claim of lack of knowledge of the illegality of structuring tends to be belied by defendant's conduct. The evidence shows that, on February 18, 1987, defendant's then-wife, Lynne Marder, acting at defendant's behest, used cash to purchase $11,460 worth of cashier's checks in amounts of $5,000, $3,960, and $2,500 from three separate banks in Derry, New Hampshire. While it certainly would make sense for a person cognizant of the reporting requirement but unaware of the illegality of structuring to make two separate purchases at two separate banks -- e.g., a purchase of $5,000 and a purchase of $6,460 -in order to obtain $11,460 without triggering a report to the IRS, the fact that defendant instructed his wife to make three separate purchases at three separate banks suggests that defendant had a purpose beyond evasion of the reporting requirement: concealment of his structuring. And proof of concealment tends to prove knowledge of illegality. See United States v. Sorrentino, 726 F.2d 876, 880 (1st Cir. 1984) (citing Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 125, 99 L. Ed. 150, 75 S. Ct. 127 (1954)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p>Moreover, our circuit has recently ruled that jury instructions misdescribing or failing to describe an element of the offense do not per se seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. Whiting, 28 F.3d at 1309-10 (declining to find plain error in a jury instruction which allowed the jury to convict a defendant for receipt or possession of an unregistered firearm without making the elemental determination that the weapon in question was a \"firearm\" within the meaning of the statute). While we in no way disparage the importance of the due process and Sixth Amendment rights that may be undermined when jury instructions misdescribe or fail to describe an element of the offense charged, we simply do not think that a deprivation of these rights in all circumstances is so \"shocking,\" as to require automatic reversal even where the defendant has failed to bring the error to the attention of the trial Judge. See United States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 100 (1st Cir.) (describing errors suitable for reversal under plain error doctrine), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 844, 98 L. Ed. 2d 94, 108 S. Ct. 137 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p>On the civil side we recently held, following circuit precedent, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>The \"plain error\" rule \"'should be applied sparingly and only in exceptional cases or under peculiar circumstances to prevent a clear miscarriage of Justice.\" Wells Real Estate, 850 F.2d at 809 (quoting Nimrod v. Sylvester, 369 F.2d 870, 873 (1st Cir. 1966)); see Elgabri, 964 F.2d at 1259. Under the \"plain error\" exception, an erroneous instruction warrants a new trial only where the error \"seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\" See Lash v. Cutts, 943 F.2d 147, 152 (1st Cir. 1991); Smith, 877 F.2d at 1110.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p>Poulin v. Greer, 18 F.3d 979, 982 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p>Finally, we do not think that the challenged instructions, in light of the particulars of this case, warrant an exercise of our discretion to determine whether the error \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" Olano, 113 S. Ct. at 1779. Our recent decision in Whiting, which is binding on us, undergirds this Conclusion. While the evidence of the omitted element is certainly less strong here than it was in Whiting, see Whiting, 28 F.3d at 1309 (documenting the overwhelming record evidence that the weapon in question was indeed a \"firearm\" within the meaning of the statute), it is, as we have noted, not insubstantial. Furthermore, the error here was far more excusable than in Whiting. At the time the defective instructions were given, they were in accord with the law of every circuit that had issued an opinion on the meaning of the anti-structuring statute's willfulness provision. Thus, we simply do not believe that they can reasonably be viewed as having caused the type of error which calls into serious question the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. See United States v. Figueroa, 976 F.2d 1446, 1456 (1st Cir. 1992) (ruling that any error in the trial court's failure to admit evidence of a cooperating witness's criminal record for impeachment purposes did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings in view of the conflict regarding the admissibility of such evidence among the circuits and the absence of on-point First Circuit precedent), cert. denied, 122 L. Ed. 2d 728, 113 S. Ct. 1346 (1993). To be sure there are cases from other circuits to the contrary. See Retos, 25 F.3d at 1232 (concluding without analysis that a defective willfulness instruction given prior to Ratzlaf in a structuring case seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings); Jones, 21 F.3d at 173 (same); United States v. Rogers, 18 F.3d 265, 268 (4th Cir. 1994) (same). We recognize that these other circuits may well have a valid rationale for their view, but we are bound by our own precedent. Furthermore, we think that it is the better solution to this problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p>In sum, we decline to vacate defendant's structuring conviction under the plain error doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

The combined length of the sentences (\"total punishment\") is determined by the adjusted combined offense level. To the extent possible, the total punishment is to be imposed on each count. Sentences on all counts run concurrently, except as required to achieve the total sentence, or as required by law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p>This section applies to multiple counts of conviction (1) contained in the same indictment or information, or (2) contained in different indictments or informations for which sentences are to be imposed at the same time or in a consolidated proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p>Usually, at least one of the counts will have a statutory maximum adequate to permit imposition of the total punishment as the sentence on that count. The sentence on each of the other counts will then be set at a lesser of the total punishment and the applicable statutory maximum, and be made to run concurrently with all or part of the longest sentence. If no count carries an adequate statutory maximum, consecutive sentences are to be imposed to the extent necessary to achieve the total punishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p>The district court sentenced the defendant to 140 months incarceration, which was in accord with the Guidelines Sentencing Range, on his RICO and Money Laundering counts (1, 2, 4-10), \"to be served concurrently on each other.\" The balance of the sentence was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p>120 months on each of counts 19 &amp; 20 to be served concurrently on each other as well as on counts 1, 2, 4-10;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p>60 months on each of counts 3,11,12, 16-18, to be served concurrently on each other as well as on counts 1,2,4-10 and counts 19 &amp; 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p>Defendant does not object to the overall sentence. He does argue that the court erred in imposing a sentence of 120 months on Counts 19 &amp; 20 (conspiracy to defraud the IRS and structuring) and 60 months on Counts 16-18 (tax evasion). In his reply brief defendant acknowledges that the sentences on Counts 16-18 \"lawfully reached the statutory maximum\" because of the provisions of U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.2 and its commentary. He therefore concedes that his attack on the sentences on counts 16-18 is contingent on reversal of the judgment on those counts carrying the 140-month sentence. Because this contingency has not occurred, the attack on the sentences for counts 16-18 fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p>As the government points out, however, the court erred in sentencing defendant to a concurrent sentence of 120 months on Count 19 for conspiring to defraud the United States. The applicable statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, provides for a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment of not more than five years, or both. Defendant's sentence on this count should have been a concurrent sentence of sixty months. We must remand to the district court for a correction of the sentence on Count 19.

In defendant's view, his failure to object to the structuring instructions given at his trial was excusable because Ratzlaf had not yet been handed down and because all of the circuits which had then issued opinions on the meaning of the term \"willful\" in the context of the anti-structuring statute had defined it in a manner consistent with the district court's instructions. Thus, defendant contends, the law \"did not support a request for the instruction later mandated in Ratzlaf.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p>Even if we were to view this argument as properly before us, cf. Sandstrom v. Chemlawn Corp., 904 F.2d 83, 86 (1st Cir. 1990) (deeming waived, in a civil case, an argument not made in appellant's opening brief), we would not find excusable defendant's failure to object to the now-challenged instructions. At the time of defendant's trial, settled law in this circuit foreshadowed the Supreme Court's Conclusion in Ratzlaf that a conviction for structuring requires proof that defendant acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful. See United States v. Bank of New England, N.A., 821 F.2d 844, 854 (1st Cir.) (\"A finding of willfulness under the Reporting Act must be supported by proof of the defendant's knowledge of the reporting requirements and his specific intent to commit the crime.\") (citations omitted) (interpreting the meaning of &#167; 5322's willfulness provision in a context other than &#167; 5324's anti-structuring provisions), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 943 (1987). Moreover, at this same time, we had withdrawn an opinion and reheard en banc a case which raised the precise question eventually decided in Ratzlaf : the meaning of &#167; 5322's willfulness provision in the anti-structuring context. See United States v. Donovan, No. 91-1574 (1st Cir. Feb. 6, 1992), reh'g en banc granted, opinion withdrawn, (1st Cir. Mar. 18, 1992), opinion reissued as redacted, 984 F.2d 493 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. granted and judgment vacated, 114 S. Ct. 873 (1994). In light of this authority and these events, of which defendant should have been aware, defendant's argument that his failure to object was excusable rings hollow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Noting that jury instructions are not to be reviewed in isolation, but rather \"in the context of the overall charge,\" Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U.S. 141, 147, 38 L. Ed. 2d 368, 94 S. Ct. 396 (1973), the government contends that a general instruction on willfulness given elsewhere in the charge was sufficient to have conveyed to the jury the appropriate structuring mens rea requirement. The instruction on which the government relies provided: \"And, for all of the counts except the tax evasion count which has a different definition of willfulness, the concept of willfulness means that somebody has acted willfully, that he acted knowingly and not by accident or mistake, and deliberately in violation of a known legal duty.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p>In our view, this instruction cannot be viewed as having cured any error in the specific structuring instruction. While the general willfulness instruction stated that the defendant had to have acted in violation of some known legal duty, it does not explicitly inform the jury that the defendant had to know that structuring itself was illegal. Furthermore, by indicating that willfulness means something different in the structuring and tax evasion contexts (the latter of which differs from most other criminal law areas by requiring specific knowledge that the conduct at issue was criminal), the jury could have inferred that the actual knowledge of illegality required in the tax evasion context was not required in the structuring context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> See United States v.

Defendant-appellant, Arthur Marder, was convicted by a jury on all seventeen counts of the indictment against him. Twelve counts of the indictment were predicated specifically on illegal gambling allegedly in violation of Massachusetts General Laws ch. 271, &#167;&#167; 7 and 17. The counts involving the Massachusetts statutes were: two RICO counts; two counts of using interstate facilities in aid of racketeering; one count of operating an illegal gambling business; and seven counts of money laundering.

ILLEGAL GAMBLING UNDER THE MASSACHUSETTS STATUTES</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Defendant owned and operated the Revere Amusement Company (\"Revere\") from 1981 to 1989. Revere's income came from the operation of video poker machines that were placed in an assortment of bars, taverns, and social clubs in Revere, Massachusetts. The poker machines operated somewhat like slot machines. The machine was activated by inserting money into it, at least a quarter. The player would then manipulate a button to obtain a poker hand. The machine's video screen would display five cards representing a poker hand. Before the \"play\" began, the screen displayed the payoffs for winning hands; i.e., a hand consisting of three of a kind might pay twelve to one. Credits were given for winning hands. For example, a full house might pay ten credits. After a winning player finished playing the machine, he exchanged his credits for cash. The cash payment was made by the person in charge of the establishment in which the machine(s) was located. Defendant and/or his employees visited the approximately seventeen places where the poker machines were located on a regular basis, usually daily. The proprietors of the establishments were reimbursed for the payoffs and then the machine's proceeds were split with them. Normally, no records were kept of the transactions. And, of course, only defendant and his employees had access to the monies paid into the poker machine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>In 1985 defendant decided to enjoy the fruits of his profitable business and moved to Palm Springs, California. Defendant's son, Steven, then took over the daily operation of Revere.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Defendant, however, kept a tight reign on Revere's operations from Palm Springs. He received between $4,000 to $10,000 in cash by express mail several times a week. At irregular intervals, he asked his employees to keep records of the transactions so he would know what was going on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Revere's income from the poker machines amounted to about $500,000 per year. There was convincing evidence that defendant made regular payoffs to local police officers, politicians, and organized crime. Neither defendant nor his company paid state or federal income tax on the income generated by the video poker game machines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>With this factual background, we turn to the question of whether defendant's poker game business violated the implicated Massachusetts statutes. This is, of course, primarily a question of Massachusetts law. And there is no Massachusetts case directly on point. We first consider Mass. Gen. L. ch. 271, &#167; 17, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>&#167; 17.

(Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>We note first that the statute is not limited to bookmaking in the traditional sense. It includes \"any device for registering bets, or buying or selling pools, upon the result of a trial or contest of skill, speed or endurance of man, beast, bird or machine, or upon the result of a game . . . .\" This is broad and encompassing language. We do not think that it excludes the placing of bets on video poker games as a matter of statutory construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>Although there are no Massachusetts cases directly on point, there are three that indicate that betting on video poker games violates &#167; 17. In Commonwealth v. Club Caravan, Inc. (and eighteen companion cases), <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass. App. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2125699\"><a href=\"/opinion/2125699/commonwealth-v-club-caravan-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span> </a></span>(Mass. App. Ct. 1991), the court made several significant rulings. It upheld the ruling of the trial Judge that \"play on the video poker machines in question involved as a matter of law an element of skill, thus qualifying the machines for licensure under Mass. Gen. L. c. 140, &#167; 177 A(1) and (2) as automatic amusement devices.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 406. </span>The court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>Since the video poker machines involved an element of skill and ostensibly paid off winners only with free games, the Judge correctly dismissed the indictments based solely on having such machines on hand for the use of patrons. The Judge correctly ruled, we think, that licensed machines so used were exempt not only from G.L. c. 271, &#167; 7, this exemption being explicit in G.L. c. 140, &#167; 177A(7), but also from G.L. c. 271, &#167;&#167; 5 and 17, seemingly overlapping statutes which in relevant part prohibit keeping a place for gaming or keeping gaming apparatus. The purpose of &#167; 177A, to legalize and license machines that utilize some element of skill and pay off winners only with free games, would otherwise be thwarted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 407. </span>The court noted that the trial Judge differentiated between video poker games and \"actual use of the machines for gambling: i.e., paying off in money rather than free games,\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> and drew </span>the following line:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>Where a machine was used for gambling, i.e., where there was evidence of a payoff to a customer, the Judge ruled that the machine, by the express terms of G.L. c. 140, &#167; 177A(6), was in violation of that statute and thus lacked protection from the prohibitions of the gaming laws such as G.L. c. 271, &#167;&#167; 5, 7, 8, and 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 407-08. </span>The court explicitly refrained from ruling as to the applicability of &#167; 17 to video poker machines. It explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>An argument was made by the defendants below that &#167; 17 was aimed at bookie operations, i.e., registering of bets on contests such as horseracing, dog racing, football point spreads, or numbers, rather than at slot machines or other gambling devices. The argument, rejected by the Judge, is not advanced in this appeal, which concerns only indictments dismissed by the Judge. We intend no ruling as to the applicability of &#167; 17 to video poker machines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 408 </span>n.6.

After inserting the required amount of money into the machine, the player selected the number of credits - the amount he wanted to bet. The machine \"registered\" the bet by displaying the number of credits he had selected and set the odds on winning the poker hand dealt the player. The bets had to be registered by the machine so that the odds could be set. Moreover, the bets had to be registered on the machine because defendant and/or his employees determined, after opening the machine, the amount of reimbursement for payouts due the proprietors of the establishments where the machines were located. And we think it could be reasonably found that the statute included the defendant as one who sold pools \"upon the result of a trial or contest of skill\" . . . or \"upon the result of a game.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>We rule, based on the evidence, the words of the statute and Massachusetts case law, that the jury could lawfully find defendant violated Mass.

He acknowledges that \"[a] video poker machine which pays off 'hits in cash can amount to a 'lottery' under &#167; 7.\" Brief at 31. His argument is that it was not proven by the government that chance predominated over skill in playing video poker and therefore there was no lottery within the meaning of &#167; 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>The Massachusetts law is reasonably clear that for there to be a lottery, chance must predominate over skill in the results of the game, or the element of chance must be present in such a manner as to thwart the exercise of skill or judgment in a game.

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we agree. There was testimony that the machine dealt the cards electronically, although a player could choose what cards to discard. There was testimony that winning depended on the cards dealt by the machine. A hand of video poker was played before the jury in the courtroom. The jury could Judge for themselves whether a substantial element of chance was involved. There was testimony that one hand of video poker took from two to ten seconds to play. Unless a player has a mind like a computer, this is hardly sufficient time to use poker skills. Another factor that the jury could take into consideration in determining whether video poker was a game dominated by chance or skill was the profit that defendant made. Obviously, there were a great many more losers than winners. Skill might have played a role in the video poker games operated by defendant, but it did not dominate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>We rule, therefore, that the jury lawfully could find defendant to have operated a lottery that was prohibited by chapter 271, &#167; 7 of the Massachusetts General Laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>The Jury Instruction -- Waiver or Forfeiture</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>Defendant claims that the court erred in instructing the jury on the Massachusetts statutes relative to gambling by refusing to read the statutes in their entirety to the jury.

Whereas forfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right, waiver is the \"intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\" . . . Whether a particular right is waivable; whether the defendant must participate personally in the waiver; whether certain procedures are required for waiver; and whether the defendant's choice must be particularly informed or voluntary, all depend on the right at stake. . . . Mere forfeiture, as opposed to waiver, does not extinguish an \"error\" under Rule 52(b). . . . If a legal rule was violated during the District Court proceedings, and if the defendant did not waive the rule, then there has been an \"error\" within the meaning of Rule 52(b) despite the absence of a timely objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1777 </a></span>(citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>Our survey of the cases in this esoteric procedural corner of the federal law convinces us that defendant did not waive the issue.

The next morning the court, after eliciting comments from counsel, read its proposed instruction to them. Both counsel explicitly agreed to the court's instruction. The court of appeals held that under these circumstances defendant had waived any objections to the instruction. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669726\"><a href=\"/opinion/669726/united-states-v-dusan-lakich/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 207-08.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>Lakich is a far cry from the case before us. In the instant case the court cut off defense counsel's question before it was finished. It is difficult to determine just what defense counsel was going to ask, particularly in light of the fact that it was the government that requested the Massachusetts statutes be read in their entirety to the jury. For aught we know, defense counsel was simply agreeing that the statutes were confusing. Or perhaps he thought it prudent to simply say, \"Yes\" and move on. In any event, we think the attempted colloquy between defense counsel and the court is too thin a peg on which to hang a finding of waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>This case clearly does not fall within the ambit of waiver resulting from a tactical decision not to object.

Even assuming that this is the law of the circuit,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> there was no direct inquiry from the court in the instant case nor an unequivocal assent to the instruction by defense counsel.

The evidence shows that, on February 18, 1987, defendant's then-wife, Lynne Marder, acting at defendant's behest, used cash to purchase $11,460 worth of cashier's checks in amounts of $5,000, $3,960, and $2,500 from three separate banks in Derry, New Hampshire. While it certainly would make sense for a person cognizant of the reporting requirement but unaware of the illegality of structuring to make two separate purchases at two separate banks -- e.g., a purchase of $5,000 and a purchase of $6,460 -in order to obtain $11,460 without triggering a report to the IRS, the fact that defendant instructed his wife to make three separate purchases at three separate banks suggests that defendant had a purpose beyond evasion of the reporting requirement: concealment of his structuring. And proof of concealment tends to prove knowledge of illegality. See United States v.

The combined length of the sentences (\"total punishment\") is determined by the adjusted combined offense level. To the extent possible, the total punishment is to be imposed on each count. Sentences on all counts run concurrently, except as required to achieve the total sentence, or as required by law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p>This section applies to multiple counts of conviction (1) contained in the same indictment or information, or (2) contained in different indictments or informations for which sentences are to be imposed at the same time or in a consolidated proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p>Usually, at least one of the counts will have a statutory maximum adequate to permit imposition of the total punishment as the sentence on that count. The sentence on each of the other counts will then be set at a lesser of the total punishment and the applicable statutory maximum, and be made to run concurrently with all or part of the longest sentence. If no count carries an adequate statutory maximum, consecutive sentences are to be imposed to the extent necessary to achieve the total punishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p>The district court sentenced the defendant to 140 months incarceration, which was in accord with the Guidelines Sentencing Range, on his RICO and Money Laundering counts (1, 2, 4-10), \"to be served concurrently on each other.\" The balance of the sentence was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p>120 months on each of counts 19 &amp; 20 to be served concurrently on each other as well as on counts 1, 2, 4-10;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p>60 months on each of counts 3,11,12, 16-18, to be served concurrently on each other as well as on counts 1,2,4-10 and counts 19 &amp; 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p>Defendant does not object to the overall sentence. He does argue that the court erred in imposing a sentence of 120 months on Counts 19 &amp; 20 (conspiracy to defraud the IRS and structuring) and 60 months on Counts 16-18 (tax evasion). In his reply brief defendant acknowledges that the sentences on Counts 16-18 \"lawfully reached the statutory maximum\" because of the provisions of U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.2 and its commentary. He therefore concedes that his attack on the sentences on counts 16-18 is contingent on reversal of the judgment on those counts carrying the 140-month sentence. Because this contingency has not occurred, the attack on the sentences for counts 16-18 fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p>As the government points out, however, the court erred in sentencing defendant to a concurrent sentence of 120 months on Count 19 for conspiring to defraud the United States. The applicable statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, provides for a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment of not more than five years, or both. Defendant's sentence on this count should have been a concurrent sentence of sixty months. We must remand to the district court for a correction of the sentence on Count 19.

In defendant's view, his failure to object to the structuring instructions given at his trial was excusable because Ratzlaf had not yet been handed down and because all of the circuits which had then issued opinions on the meaning of the term \"willful\" in the context of the anti-structuring statute had defined it in a manner consistent with the district court's instructions. Thus, defendant contends, the law \"did not support a request for the instruction later mandated in Ratzlaf.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p>Even if we were to view this argument as properly before us, cf.

At the time of defendant's trial, settled law in this circuit foreshadowed the Supreme Court's Conclusion in Ratzlaf that a conviction for structuring requires proof that defendant acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful. See United States v. Bank of New England, N.A., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490115\"><a href=\"/opinion/490115/united-states-v-bank-of-new-england-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span>, 854 (1st Cir.)

Moreover, at this same time, we had withdrawn an opinion and reheard en banc a case which raised the precise question eventually decided in Ratzlaf : the meaning of &#167; 5322's willfulness provision in the anti-structuring context. See United States v. Donovan, No. 91-1574 (1st Cir. Feb. 6, 1992), reh'g en banc granted, opinion withdrawn, (1st Cir.

Furthermore, by indicating that willfulness means something different in the structuring and tax evasion contexts (the latter of which differs from most other criminal law areas by requiring specific knowledge that the conduct at issue was criminal), the jury could have inferred that the actual knowledge of illegality required in the tax evasion context was not required in the structuring context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> See United States v.
