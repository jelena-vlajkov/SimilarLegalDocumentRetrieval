Michael  Lau  and  his codefendant  Bruce\r                            \n\nTaylor  were each convicted in December 1985 at a joint trial\n\non drug charges.  Lau was sentenced to 35 years and Taylor to\n\n25  years  and their  convictions  were  affirmed on  appeal.\n\nUnited States v.  Lau, 828  F.2d 871 (1st  Cir. 1987),  cert.\r                                                                         \n\ndenied,  486   U.S.  1005   (1988).    Based   on  subsequent\r                  \n\ncooperation, the  sentences were  later reduced, Lau's  to 25\n\nyears  and Taylor's to 15 years.   Lau now appeals the denial\n\nof his  recent  motion under  28 U.S.C.    2255  in which  he\n\nchallenged the 10 year disparity in  his sentence as compared\n\nwith that  of Taylor.  He claims that the two were similar in\n\nculpability and history and that the only explanation for the\n\ndisparity   is  the   trial  judge's   remarks  at   Taylor's\r                                                                       \n\nsentencing, that suggested that Taylor was led astray by Lau.\n\nThis, says Lau, is untrue.  \n\n     The Sentencing Guidelines did not apply to this case and\n\nthe sentencing judge therefore had extremely wide discretion,\n\nlargely beyond  appellate review.  See  Williams v. Illinois,\r                                                                        \n\n399 U.S.  235, 243  (1970).   The Supreme  Court did say,  in\n\nUnited  States v. Tucker, 404  U.S. 443, 447  (1972), that an\r                                    \n\nappellate  remedy  may  be available  where  a  pre-guideline\n\nsentence  is founded  upon \"misinformation  of constitutional\n\nmagnitude\"; but in that case  the sentencing judge had relied\n\non  two prior  convictions  that had  been unconstitutionally\n\nobtained.   \"Instead of confronting  a defendant who had been\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nlegally convicted  of three previous felonies,  the judge [if\n\nproperly  informed] would then  have been dealing  with a man\n\nwho,  beginning  at  age  17,  had  been   unconstitutionally\n\nimprisoned for more than ten years . . . .\"  Id. at 448.\r                                                            \n\n     Lau's   case  is   not   remotely   comparable.      The\n\nresponsibility  of one  person  for  another's misconduct  is\n\ngenerally  a  matter of  degree  and  of  judgment.    Tucker\r                                                                         \n\ninvolved  the  perpetuation of  prior  convictions  that were\n\nlater  found to  be unconstitutional.   Further,  the Supreme\r                                                \n\nCourt thought that the prejudice in Tucker was patent.  Here,\r                                                      \n\nthe fact  that the  remark was made  at Taylor's  sentencing,\n\nrather than  Lau's, suggests  that the court's  impression is\n\nmore likely to  have reduced Taylor's  sentence than to  have\n\nenlarged Lau's.  Assuming that  there was any misappraisal at\n\nall, we do not think that it is of constitutional magnitude.\n\n     There  is some suggestion in  Lau's brief that he thinks\n\nthat  he was entitled to be present at Taylor's sentencing to\n\ncontest the judge's remarks  about Lau's influence on Taylor.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P.  43(a) entitles a defendant to be present at\n\nhis own sentencing and not that of another  defendant.  It is\n\nin fact common  practice for codefendants to  be sentenced at\n\ndifferent times, depending  on when the respective  probation\n\nreports are completed.\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n",
