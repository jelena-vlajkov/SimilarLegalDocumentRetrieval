On  March 17, 1994, two days  after denying\r                           \r\n\nplaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, the district\r\n\ncourt issued a sua sponte margin order dismissing this breach\r                                     \r\n\nof  contract action  on the ground  of mootness.   Plaintiffs\r\n\ninsist they never received notice  of such dismissal from the\r\n\nclerk's  office, averring that they first  learned of it from\r\n\nopposing  counsel on  August 3,  1994.   Nearly  three months\r\n\nlater, on October 27, plaintiffs filed a motion under Fed. R.\r\n\nCiv.  P. 60(b) to vacate  the order of  dismissal; they there\r\n\nargued  that  the  mootness  determination  had  overlooked a\r\n\ndamages  claim in their complaint.  This motion was summarily\r\n\ndenied.  A motion for  reconsideration followed, only to meet\r\n\nthe same fate.  Plaintiffs having now appealed, we  summarily\r\n\naffirm.\r\n\n     At the  outset, we note  that plaintiffs have  failed to\r\n\nappreciate all that  is before  us for review.   While  their\r\n\nnotice of appeal listed  both the denial of their  Rule 60(b)\r\n\nmotion and  the denial  of their motion  for reconsideration,\r\n\nthey now \"concede\" that we lack  jurisdiction over the former\r\n\nbecause  no timely appeal  was filed therefrom.   Yet because\r\n\ndefendant is an  \"agency of the United  States,\" Carpenter v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nWestern Credit Union, 62  F.3d 143, 144 n.1 (6th  Cir. 1995),\r                                \r\n\nthe sixty-day  appeal period  prescribed by  Fed. R.  App. P.\r\n\n4(a)(1) was triggered.  And plaintiffs' appeal, it turns out,\r\n\nwas filed two days  short of this deadline.   Whether through\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nhappenstance  or otherwise,  the denial  of their  Rule 60(b)\r\n\nmotion is thus properly subject to review.1\r\n\n     Nonetheless,  plaintiffs' claim  falters on  the merits.\r\n\n\"[B]ecause   Rule  60(b)  is  a  vehicle  for  'extraordinary\r\n\nrelief,' motions  invoking the  rule should be  granted 'only\r\n\nunder   exceptional  circumstances.'\"     de   la  Torre   v.\r                                                                    \r\n\nContinental  Ins.  Co., 15  F.3d  12, 14-15  (1st  Cir. 1994)\r                                  \r\n\n(quoting  Lepore v. Vidockler,  792 F.2d  272, 274  (1st Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1986)).  No such circumstances are present here.  We think it\r\n\nsignificant  that, at the time  they learned of  the March 17\r\n\ndismissal, plaintiffs could have moved to reopen the time for\r\n\nappeal pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)--a remedy that was\r\n\ndesigned  to  address the  very  plight in  which  they found\r\n\nthemselves.   Plaintiffs  failed  to do  so.   Instead,  they\r\n\nwaited  nearly three  months  before filing  their motion  to\r\n\nvacate.    Such inaction  on  their  part militates  strongly\r\n\nagainst  the availability of  Rule 60(b) relief.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The argument actually advanced  by plaintiffs on appeal--\r\nthat the district court abused  its discretion in denying the\r\nmotion for reconsideration--can  be readily  rejected.   That\r\nmotion  complained solely of legal error  in the court's Rule\r\n60(b)  denial and so, by definition, sought relief under Fed.\r\nR. Civ. P.  59(e).  See, e.g.,  Feinstein v. Moses, 951  F.2d\r                                                              \r\n16, 19  n.3 (1st Cir. 1991).   Yet it was  served outside the\r\napplicable ten-day limit, rendering such  relief unavailable.\r\nSee, e.g., Acevedo-Villalobos v.  Hernandez, 22 F.3d 384, 390\r                                                       \r\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 574 (1994).  And even if\r                                    \r\nconstrued  as seeking  relief  under Rule  60(b), the  second\r\nmotion   would  border  on   the  frivolous--inasmuch  as  no\r\n\"exceptional  circumstances\"  surrounded  the denial  of  the\r\nfirst motion.  See, e.g., Rodriguez-Antuna v. Chase Manhattan\r                                                                         \r\nBank Corp., 871 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1989).\r                      \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nJenkins v. Burtzloff,      F.3d     , 1995 WL  640413, at  *4\r                                \r\n\n(10th  Cir. 1995)  (holding that,  where plaintiff  failed to\r\n\npursue Rule  4(a)(6) relief,  \"Rule 60(b)(1) cannot  save his\r\n\nappeal\");  Zimmer St. Louis, Inc. v. Zimmer Co., 32 F.3d 357,\r                                                           \r\n\n360-61 (8th Cir. 1994).2   As well, whatever the  validity of\r\n\nthe court's mootness determination,  our review of the record\r\n\nreveals  that plaintiffs'  underlying action  was of  dubious\r\n\nmerit.  Given this  set of circumstances, we find no abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion.\r\n\n     Affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\r                                             \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The Zimmer  court went so  far as to hold  that, with the\r                          \r\nadvent of Rule 4(a)(6), \"district  courts no longer have  the\r\ndiscretion\" to  grant Rule 60(b)(6) relief  \"to cure problems\r\nof lack of notice\"--even  when such notice is acquired  after\r\nthe expiration  of Rule 4(a)(6)'s  180-day deadline.   See 32\r                                                                      \r\nF.3d  at 361.   We have no  occasion to  address that holding\r\nhere.    Assuming arguendo  that  Rule  60(b) relief  remains\r                                      \r\navailable in  this  context, we  find  that it  was  properly\r\ndenied.   \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",

Zimmer Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676121\"><a href=\"/opinion/676121/zimmer-st-louis-inc-appelleecross-appellant-v-zimmer-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span>, 360-61 (8th Cir.1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  As well, whatever the validity of the court's mootness determination, our review of the record reveals that plaintiffs' underlying action was of dubious merit.  Given this set of circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed. See Loc.  R. 27.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The argument actually advanced by plaintiffs on appeal--that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration--can be readily rejected.  That motion complained solely of legal error in the court's Rule 60(b) denial and so, by definition, sought relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e).  See, e.g., Feinstein v. Moses, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573153\"><a href=\"/opinion/573153/frederick-feinstein-v-morris-and-joyce-moses-dba-sun-cal-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 19 n. 3 (1st Cir.1991).  Yet it was served outside the applicable ten-day limit, rendering such relief unavailable.  See, e.g., Acevedo-Villalobos v. Hernandez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195330\"><a href=\"/opinion/195330/acevedo-villalobos-v-hon-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span>, 390 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span> </span>(1994).  And even if construed as seeking relief under Rule 60(b), the second motion would border on the frivolous--inasmuch as no \"exceptional circumstances\" surrounded the denial of the first motion.  See, e.g., Rodriguez-Antuna v. Chase Manhattan Bank Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520401\"><a href=\"/opinion/520401/migda-rodriguez-antuna-v-chase-manhattan-bank-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1989)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Zimmer court went so far as to hold that, with the advent of Rule 4(a)(6), \"district courts no longer have the discretion\" to grant Rule 60(b)(6) relief \"to cure problems of lack of notice\"--even when such notice is acquired after the expiration of Rule 4(a)(6)'s 180-day deadline.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676121\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> <a href=\"/opinion/676121/zimmer-st-louis-inc-appelleecross-appellant-v-zimmer-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span>.  We have no occasion to address that holding here.  Assuming arguendo that Rule 60(b) relief remains available in this context, we find that it was properly denied</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
