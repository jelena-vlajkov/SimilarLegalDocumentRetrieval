Petitioners  Peter  Fisher  and  Balfour\n                  \n\n  Holding, Inc. [hereinafter collectively \"Fisher\"] seek a writ\n\n  of mandamus directed to the United States District Court  for\n\n  the District of  Massachusetts.  This petition  arises out of\n\n  the district  court's order  declaring a  mistrial after  the\n\n  parties to the action could  not agree on the implications of\n\n  the jury's answer to questions submitted to  them pursuant to\n\n  Fed.R.Civ.P.   49(a).     The  court   found   that  in   the\n\n  circumstances of the case, \"justice w[ould] best be served by\n\n  retracing what, in the context of this litigation, ha[d] been\n\n  a relatively small step.\"\n\n  Background\n            \n\n       The matter below has its  source in two actions, both of\n\n  which  relate to a multi-party  venture aimed at developing a\n\n  human  blood substitute.   We  summarize  the facts  briefly.\n\n  Biopure Corporation manufactures Hemopure, a potential  human\n\n  blood substitute.   In the  late  1980s, William  Trainor and\n\n  Peter  Fisher  discussed   entering  into  a   joint  venture\n\n  agreement  to provide  financial  assistance  to  Biopure  in\n\n  exchange for  certain rights  in Hemopure  and other  Biopure\n\n  products.  Fisher believed that an agreement had been entered\n\n  into.  However, in 1990, Biopure and a corporation controlled\n\n  by Trainor, Bio-Vita,  Ltd., entered into an  agreement which\n\n  did  not  include  Fisher.    Believing  himself   wrongfully\n\n  excluded  from the  deal, Fisher  brought  an action  against\n\n  Biopure and Trainor [the \"Fisher Action\"].  After Trainor had\n\n  invested over  one million  dollars in  the Biopure  project,\n\n  Biopure rescinded  the 1990  agreements on  the grounds  that\n\n  Trainor  had  made  misrepresentations  and  failed  to  meet\n\n  certain obligations.   Trainor then commenced his  own action\n\n  against Biopure [the \"Bio-Vita Action\"].\n\n       After  more than  two years  of  pretrial discovery  and\n\n  litigation, the Fisher Action was called to trial in November\n\n  1992.  The court severed  the first count of Fisher's amended\n\n  complaint  for immediate  trial.    This  count  alleged  the\n\n  existence, and Trainor's  breach, of a binding  joint venture\n\n  agreement.   The amended  complaint also  included counts  of\n\n  misrepresentation, interference with contract or advantageous\n\n  relationship, and  breach of fiduciary duty  against Trainor,\n\n  and several counts against Biopure.\n\n       At the  conclusion of the trial, and upon stipulation by\n\n  the  parties, the following  questions were submitted  to the\n\n  jury pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(a):\n\n          1.     Did [Fisher] and  [Trainor] enter into\n          a binding  oral contract providing  that they\n          would share  50/50 in  the expense  and gains\n          involved in the Biopure project?\n\n          If  your answer to  question one is  \"No\" you\n          need  go no  further.    If  your  answer  to\n          question one  is \"Yes\"  go on to  question[s]\n          two and three.\n\n          2.     Did [Fisher] breach the terms of [the]\n          oral contract with [Trainor] by unjustifiably\n\n                               -4-\n\n          failing to contribute [his] agreed upon share\n          of  the  purchase  price  and other  expenses\n          incurred with respect to the Biopure project?\n\n          3.     Did [Trainor] breach the  terms of his\n          oral contract with  [Fisher] by unjustifiably\n          denying    [Fisher]    an    opportunity   to\n          participate on  a 50/50 basis in  the Biopure\n          project?\n\nThe  jury answered \"yes\" to questions  one and three, and \"no\" to\n\nquestion  two.1   The  court  then  recessed  the jury  with  the\n\nintention of  bringing them  back later to  resolve the  issue of\n\ndamages.   \n\n       The jury was never called back.  Instead on July 12, 1993,\n\nthe court declared a mistrial sua sponte.   It based its decision\n                                        \n\non  the fact  that the  parties \"could  not .  .  . agree  to the\n\nimplications of the  jury's special verdict\"2 and  how to proceed\n\n                      \n\n  1.    Given these  responses  the jury  was  not required  to\n  address a  fourth question  which asked, if  both Fisher  and\n  Trainor had breached the contract, who breached it first.\n\n  2.  According to the court's memorandum: \n\n       Trainor believes that Fisher's right to any relief-\n       -i.e., a  share in  the judgment,  if any,  against\n       Biopure--should be conditioned upon  his payment of\n       those  expenses he  would  have been  obligated  to\n       cover  had he not been excluded as a joint venturer\n       from  the Biopure project.    Fisher argues that he\n       is excused  from not  putting up  his share  of the\n       expenses, in light of Trainor's breach of the joint\n       venture agreement.  Fisher contends that  the trial\n       of  the  remaining  counts in  the  Fisher  Action,\n       including  the damages  phase  of the  first count,\n       should await  the conclusion  of the  trial in  the\n       Bio-Vita   Action.     Trainor   has  expressed   a\n       willingness  to proceed  with the  Bio-Vita Action,\n       but not  without the  financial support of  Fisher.\n       Moreover,  the parties disagree as to who should be\n       controlling counsel  with respect to  the remaining\n\n                               -5-\n\nagainst  Biopure   in  the   Bio-Vita  Action.     \"Given   these\n\nextraordinary  circumstances,  [the court]  decided  not  to hold\n\neither party to the other's  interpretation of the verdict, or to\n\n[its] own.\"\n\n       Petitioners  contend that in  failing to enter  a verdict,\n\npursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(2), in accord with the jury's special\n\nverdict, the court deprived them of their Seventh Amendment right\n\nto  have judgment  entered on  the findings  of the  jury.   They\n\npetition  this court  to issue a  writ to  the district  court to\n\nenter judgment on the special verdict.\n\nUses of Mandamus\n                \n\n       The All Writs  Act, 28 U.S.C.    1651(a), empowers federal\n\ncourts to issue writs of mandamus where \"necessary or appropriate\n\nin aid  of their respective  jurisdictions.\"  See In  Re Pearson,\n                                                                \n\n990 F.2d 653, 656 (1st Cir. 1993).  Traditionally such writs have\n\nbeen used \"to  confine inferior courts to the  lawful exercise of\n\ntheir  prescribed jurisdiction or  compel them to  exercise their\n\nauthority when  duty demands.\"  Id.; see also  Mallard v.  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates Dist. Court  for Southern Dist., 490 U.S.  296, 308 (1989)\n                                     \n\n(quoting Roche v. Evaporated Milk Ass'n, 319 U.S. 21, 26 (1943)).\n                                       \n\nBeing drastic measures, such writs \"must be used sparing and only\n\nin  extraordinary situations.\"  Pearson, 990  F.2d at 653 (citing\n                                       \n\ncases).   Otherwise they  may undermine the  policies surrounding\n\n                      \n\n       counts.\n\n                               -6-\n\nthe  congressional  judgment  that in  general  appellate  review\n\nshould be postponed until after  final judgment.  Allied Chemical\n                                                                 \n\nCorp. v. Daiflon, Inc., 449 U.S. 33,  35 (1980).  The decision on\n                     \n\nwhether  to issue the writ is within the sound discretion of this\n\ncourt.  Kerr v. United  States District Court for Northern Dist.,\n                                                               \n\n426 U.S. 394, 403 (1976).\n\n       To  ensure that  the  writ  issue  only  in  extraordinary\n\ncircumstances, a  petitioner is  required to  show \"some  special\n\nrisk of irreparable harm\" and  a \"clear entitlement to the relief\n\nrequested\" before a  writ will be issued.3   In Re  Recticel Foam\n                                                                 \n\nCorp., 859 F.2d 1000, 1005 (1st Cir.  1988); Pearson, 990 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n656.   To  satisfy  the  first  requirement, a  petitioner  \"must\n\nordinarily demonstrate  that something  about the  order, or  its\n\ncircumstances  would make  an end-of-case  appeal ineffectual  or\n\nleave legitimate  interests  unduly  at risk.\"      Id.  (quoting\n                                                      \n\nRecticel,  859  F.2d  at  1005-06).    To   satisfy  the  second,\n        \n\npetitioner  must \"establish a  'clear and indisputable'  right to\n\nthe  requested  relief or,  in other  words, that  the challenged\n\norder is  palpably erroneous.\"   Id. (quoting Banker Life  &amp; Cas.\n                                                                 \n\nCo. v. Holland,  346 U.S. 379, 384 (1953)  (quoting United States\n                                                                 \n\nv.

See  In Re\n                                                               \n  Recticel Foam Corp., 859 F.2d 1000, 1005 n.4 (1st Cir. 1988).\n                    \n  This is not such a case.\n\n                               -7-\n\nDiscussion\n          \n\n       Petitioners  assert  that  the  court's failure  to  enter\n\njudgment in accord with the  verdict in their favor deprived them\n\nof their rights under the Seventh Amendment.  See Robles v. Exxon\n                                                                 \n\nCorp., 862  F.2d 1201,  1204 (5th Cir.),  cert. denied,  490 U.S.\n                                                      \n\n(1989)  (\"rule 58(2)  and  the  seventh  amendment  command  that\n\njudgment  be entered  on the  verdict if  the jury's  answers are\n\nclear and  consistent, subject, of  course, to the  usual motions\n\nunder rules 50 and 59 for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or\n\na new trial\"); Toucet v. Maritime  Overseas Corp., 991 F.2d 5,  8\n                                                \n\n(1st  Cir.  1993) (\"[w]hen  a  special  verdict form  results  in\n\napparently  conflicting findings,  a court has  a duty  under the\n\nSeventh Amendment  to harmonize  the answers  if at  all possible\n\nunder a  fair  reading\").    Furthermore, they  assert  that  the\n\ncourt's  declaration of a mistrial  because the parties could not\n\nagree  on  the meaning  of  the  verdict  was  a clear  abuse  of\n\ndiscretion.   See Freeman  v. Package  Machinery,  Co., 865  F.2d\n                                                     \n\n1331, 1333 (1st Cir. 1988)  (judge may set aside jury  verdict in\n\ncivil case \"only if, 'it is quite clear that the jury has reached\n\na  seriously  erroneous  result.'\") (quoting  Borras  v. Sea-Land\n                                                                 \n\nServices, Inc., 586  F.2d 881, 887 (1st  Cir. 1978)).  We  do not\n             \n\naddress the merits of these contentions.\n\n       As  we  have  said  above,  to  obtain  mandamus relief  a\n\npetitioner must show both a  special risk of irreparable harm and\n                         \n\na clear entitlement to the relief he seeks. The Supreme Court has\n\n                               -8-\n\nindicated that \"[a] trial court's ordering of a new trial rarely,\n\nif ever, will justify the issuance of a writ of mandamus\" because\n\nit is  likely to  meet neither of  these standards.  Daiflon, 449\n                                                            \n\nU.S.  at 36   First, since a  litigant may seek  review on direct\n\nappeal after final judgment, it  cannot be said that the litigant\n\nis without  other adequate means  of relief.  Id.   Second, in  a\n                                                \n\nmatter  committed to  the discretion  of the  trial court,  it is\n\nunlikely  that a  litigant can  demonstrate that  his right  to a\n\nparticular result is clear and indisputable.  Id.  \n                                                \n\n       Even  if this were  a rare instance  where a discretionary\n\norder  by a  trial  court  was a  palpable  abuse of  discretion,\n\npetitioners still have an adequate remedy through a direct appeal\n\nafter final  judgment. See   Navarro de Cosme v.  Hospital Pavia,\n                                                                \n\n922 F.2d 926, 929 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"[i]n a civil case, the remedy\n\nfor  a wrongfully  declared mistrial  is  a second  trial\").   An\n\nerroneous declaration of  a mistrial--if the declaration  were in\n\nfact  erroneous--is not an extraordinary circumstance.  Hence, it\n\ndoes not merit the extraordinary  remedy of mandamus relief.  Nor\n\ndoes the  fact that an  appeal after final judgment  will require\n\nmore  burdensome litigation, standing  alone, justify our  use of\n\nthe power of mandamus.

Petitioners  Peter  Fisher  and  Balfour\n                  \n\n  Holding, Inc. [hereinafter collectively \"Fisher\"] seek a writ\n\n  of mandamus directed to the United States District Court  for\n\n  the District of  Massachusetts.  This petition  arises out of\n\n  the district  court's order  declaring a  mistrial after  the\n\n  parties to the action could  not agree on the implications of\n\n  the jury's answer to questions submitted to  them pursuant to\n\n  Fed.R.Civ.P.   49(a).     The  court   found   that  in   the\n\n  circumstances of the case, \"justice w[ould] best be served by\n\n  retracing what, in the context of this litigation, ha[d] been\n\n  a relatively small step.\"\n\n  Background\n            \n\n       The matter below has its  source in two actions, both of\n\n  which  relate to a multi-party  venture aimed at developing a\n\n  human  blood substitute.   We  summarize  the facts  briefly.\n\n  Biopure Corporation manufactures Hemopure, a potential  human\n\n  blood substitute.   In the  late  1980s, William  Trainor and\n\n  Peter  Fisher  discussed   entering  into  a   joint  venture\n\n  agreement  to provide  financial  assistance  to  Biopure  in\n\n  exchange for  certain rights  in Hemopure  and other  Biopure\n\n  products.  Fisher believed that an agreement had been entered\n\n  into.  However, in 1990, Biopure and a corporation controlled\n\n  by Trainor, Bio-Vita,  Ltd., entered into an  agreement which\n\n  did  not  include  Fisher.    Believing  himself   wrongfully\n\n  excluded  from the  deal, Fisher  brought  an action  against\n\n  Biopure and Trainor [the \"Fisher Action\"].  After Trainor had\n\n  invested over  one million  dollars in  the Biopure  project,\n\n  Biopure rescinded  the 1990  agreements on  the grounds  that\n\n  Trainor  had  made  misrepresentations  and  failed  to  meet\n\n  certain obligations.   Trainor then commenced his  own action\n\n  against Biopure [the \"Bio-Vita Action\"].\n\n       After  more than  two years  of  pretrial discovery  and\n\n  litigation, the Fisher Action was called to trial in November\n\n  1992.  The court severed  the first count of Fisher's amended\n\n  complaint  for immediate  trial.    This  count  alleged  the\n\n  existence, and Trainor's  breach, of a binding  joint venture\n\n  agreement.   The amended  complaint also  included counts  of\n\n  misrepresentation, interference with contract or advantageous\n\n  relationship, and  breach of fiduciary duty  against Trainor,\n\n  and several counts against Biopure.\n\n       At the  conclusion of the trial, and upon stipulation by\n\n  the  parties, the following  questions were submitted  to the\n\n  jury pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(a):\n\n          1.     Did [Fisher] and  [Trainor] enter into\n          a binding  oral contract providing  that they\n          would share  50/50 in  the expense  and gains\n          involved in the Biopure project?\n\n          If  your answer to  question one is  \"No\" you\n          need  go no  further.    If  your  answer  to\n          question one  is \"Yes\"  go on to  question[s]\n          two and three.\n\n          2.     Did [Fisher] breach the terms of [the]\n          oral contract with [Trainor] by unjustifiably\n\n                               -4-\n\n          failing to contribute [his] agreed upon share\n          of  the  purchase  price  and other  expenses\n          incurred with respect to the Biopure project?\n\n          3.     Did [Trainor] breach the  terms of his\n          oral contract with  [Fisher] by unjustifiably\n          denying    [Fisher]    an    opportunity   to\n          participate on  a 50/50 basis in  the Biopure\n          project?\n\nThe  jury answered \"yes\" to questions  one and three, and \"no\" to\n\nquestion  two.1   The  court  then  recessed  the jury  with  the\n\nintention of  bringing them  back later to  resolve the  issue of\n\ndamages.   \n\n       The jury was never called back.  Instead on July 12, 1993,\n\nthe court declared a mistrial sua sponte.   It based its decision\n                                        \n\non  the fact  that the  parties \"could  not .  .  . agree  to the\n\nimplications of the  jury's special verdict\"2 and  how to proceed\n\n                      \n\n  1.    Given these  responses  the jury  was  not required  to\n  address a  fourth question  which asked, if  both Fisher  and\n  Trainor had breached the contract, who breached it first.\n\n  2.  According to the court's memorandum: \n\n       Trainor believes that Fisher's right to any relief-\n       -i.e., a  share in  the judgment,  if any,  against\n       Biopure--should be conditioned upon  his payment of\n       those  expenses he  would  have been  obligated  to\n       cover  had he not been excluded as a joint venturer\n       from  the Biopure project.    Fisher argues that he\n       is excused  from not  putting up  his share  of the\n       expenses, in light of Trainor's breach of the joint\n       venture agreement.  Fisher contends that  the trial\n       of  the  remaining  counts in  the  Fisher  Action,\n       including  the damages  phase  of the  first count,\n       should await  the conclusion  of the  trial in  the\n       Bio-Vita   Action.     Trainor   has  expressed   a\n       willingness  to proceed  with the  Bio-Vita Action,\n       but not  without the  financial support of  Fisher.\n       Moreover,  the parties disagree as to who should be\n       controlling counsel  with respect to  the remaining\n\n                               -5-\n\nagainst  Biopure   in  the   Bio-Vita  Action.     \"Given   these\n\nextraordinary  circumstances,  [the court]  decided  not  to hold\n\neither party to the other's  interpretation of the verdict, or to\n\n[its] own.\"\n\n       Petitioners  contend that in  failing to enter  a verdict,\n\npursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(2), in accord with the jury's special\n\nverdict, the court deprived them of their Seventh Amendment right\n\nto  have judgment  entered on  the findings  of the  jury.   They\n\npetition  this court  to issue a  writ to  the district  court to\n\nenter judgment on the special verdict.\n\nUses of Mandamus\n                \n\n       The All Writs  Act, 28 U.S.C.    1651(a), empowers federal\n\ncourts to issue writs of mandamus where \"necessary or appropriate\n\nin aid  of their respective  jurisdictions.\"  See In  Re Pearson,\n                                                                \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604120\"><a href=\"/opinion/604120/in-re-donald-pearson/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">653</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 656 (1st Cir. 1993).
