Gen. L. ch.  151B.  Grant also challenges  the district\n\ncourt's  denial  of  his   late-filed  motion  to  amend  the\n\ncomplaint.    While the  record  contains troubling  evidence\n\nregarding the  Herald's pressroom  hiring practices, it  does\n\nnot support  Grant's claim  that the complained-of  acts were\n\nprompted by  racial discrimination  or a  retaliatory animus.\n\nNor  does it persuade us  that the district  court abused its\n\ndiscretion in refusing to allow Grant to amend his complaint.\n\nWe therefore affirm.\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \n\nA.  The Initial Complaint\r            A.  The Initial Complaint\r                                     \n\n          The initial complaint made the following claims:  \n\n(1) the  Herald reduced  Grant's hours  in December  1991 and\n\nJanuary 1992  because of his race; (2)  the Herald terminated\n\nGrant  as  a  substitute  paperhandler in  February  1992  in\n\nretaliation for his complaining about this reduction in hours\n\nand other alleged  acts of discrimination; and (3) the Herald\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nterminated  Grant  as a  substitute paperhandler  in February\n\n1992   because  of  his  race.    In  so  characterizing  the\n\ncomplaint,  we  obviously  reject  Grant's  argument  that it\n\nstated  a claim that the Herald refused to promote Grant from\n\nthe   position  of   substitute  paperhandler   to  full-time\n\npaperhandler  because of his race.   Nothing in the complaint\n\neven  remotely intimates  that this  is a  failure-to-promote\n\ncase.  See Mack  v. Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co., Inc.,\r                                                                        \n\n871 F.2d 179, 183-84 (1st Cir. 1989) (warning the bar that we\n\nwill  hold  litigants to  their  duty \"to  spell  out [their]\n\ntheories clearly and distinctly  before the nisi prius court,\n\non pain of preclusion\"). \n\n          The following  facts are  directly relevant  to the\n\nclaims made in the initial complaint.  Grant began working as\n\na substitute paperhandler in  November 1989, after he learned\n\nof  the position from his brother Jeffrey, who is a full-time\n\nemployee of the Herald.  A substitute paperhandler is a part-\n\ntime  employee   who  does  the  same  work  as  a  full-time\n\npaperhandler  -- moving  large rolls  of  newsprint, removing\n\nwrapper  heads  from  the  rolls, bringing  plates  from  the\n\npressroom to the  presses, and cleaning the  pressroom -- but\n\nworks only on an as-needed basis.  A substitute  paperhandler\n\ndoes  not need  a high  school diploma,  technical vocational\n\ntraining, or other education.  He is an at-will employee and,\n\nunlike  full-time paperhandlers (who are unionized), does not\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nhave employee benefits such as paid vacation leave, sick pay,\n\nor health  insurance.   Of paramount concern to the Herald is\n\na substitute  paperhandler's willingness and  availability to\n\n\"cover the job\"  -- i.e., to work when scheduled or called at\n\nthe  last minute.    As Grant  himself  admits, there  is  an\n\nexpectation  that substitutes  will \"never  say no\"  and that\n\nthey will show up at work \"dead or alive.\"\n\n          The   Herald  has  several   methods  of  notifying\n\nsubstitute paperhandlers to come  to work.  If the  pressroom\n\nsuperintendent, Robert Reilly, knows  in advance that he will\n\nneed substitutes,  he posts a list  -- the \"work list\"  -- of\n\nthe  substitutes  who are  scheduled to  work  each day  of a\n\nparticular  week.   Sometimes, he includes  next to  the work\n\nlist  a  \"next  list,\"  which contains  the  names  of  those\n\nsubstitutes  who will  be  called at  the  last minute  if  a\n\npreviously  scheduled full-time or substitute paperhandler is\n\nabsent.  Also, substitutes  are told that if they  want work,\n\nthey should call the  Herald before the beginning of  a shift\n\nto see if there are any openings.\n\n          Grant had two tenures  as a substitute paperhandler\n\nat  the Herald.  The  first, which lasted  from November 1989\n\nthrough  April  1990, ended  when  Reilly  terminated Grant's\n\nemployment after  a fight with a  full-time, white co-worker,\n\nJoseph  Gauthier.   During  the course  of this  altercation,\n\nGauthier  subjected Grant  to racial  slurs and  spat  in his\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nface.    Although  Reilly  fired  Grant,  he  only  suspended\n\nGauthier.  The Herald explains this differential treatment in\n\ntwo ways.   First, Gauthier, as a union member,  could not be\n\nterminated without  cause, and  was entitled to  certain pre-\n\ntermination procedures set forth in the collective bargaining\n\nagreement.   Second, Reilly allegedly had  warned Grant a few\n\ntimes  about failing  to cover  the job,  and  viewed Grant's\n\ninvolvement in the altercation as \"the last straw.\"\n\n          Subsequent  to his  April  1990 termination,  Grant\n\nwent to the  Massachusetts Commission Against  Discrimination\n\n(\"MCAD\") and charged  the Herald with  racial discrimination.\n\nOn  January 11,  1991,  Grant  and the  Herald  settled  this\n\ncharge.   As part  of  the settlement  agreement, the  Herald\n\nrestored Grant  to the substitute paperhandler  list and paid\n\nhim a sum  of money.  In return, Grant  agreed to release the\n\nHerald  from all claims arising out of his employment to that\n\npoint  in time.   Grant  returned to  his former  position on\n\nJanuary 14, 1991.\n\n          Although  Grant always  performed his  duties well,\n\nhis   ability  and   willingness  to   cover  the   job  were\n\nconsistently at  issue.   From January 1991  through December\n\n1991, there were nine occasions on which Grant was  scheduled\n\nin  advance to  cover  a shift  but failed  to come  to work.\n\nWithout  notice,   Reilly  discontinued  using   Grant  as  a\n\nsubstitute in December 1991.   When Grant inquired as  to why\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nhe  was  no  longer  getting  any hours,  Daniel  Messing,  a\n\npressroom  supervisor, informed him  that no substitutes were\n\ngetting any hours.   Grant  then checked the  work lists  and\n\ndiscovered  that, in fact, two white substitute paperhandlers\n\nwere working.       Grant thereafter requested a meeting with\n\nReilly and, on January 21, 1992, Grant and Reilly convened to\n\ndiscuss Grant's work status.  At that meeting, it was decided\n\nthat  Grant would be put back on  the substitute list.  Grant\n\nworked nine times in the  next few weeks, but then failed  to\n\nappear  on February 12, 1992  and called in  sick on February\n\n20, 1992.  By letter dated February 21, 1992, Reilly informed\n\nGrant  that he would be  removed from the  list of substitute\n\nworkers.   Although  Grant labors  mightily to  circumvent or\n\nobscure some basic facts,  the record reveals:  (1)  no other\n\nsubstitute  paperhandler  failed to  cover an  assigned shift\n\nmore  frequently than  Grant during  the period  from January\n\n1991 through  February 1992;  (2) Grant often failed  to work\n\nwhen his name  was on the next list  during this same period;\n\n(3) the  two white substitute paperhandlers with job-coverage\n\nrecords most similar  to Grant's (and to whom  Grant compares\n\nhimself  in making  his  disparate  treatment argument)  were\n\nterminated   in  the   fifteen   months   following   Grant's\n\ntermination  for failing to cover the job; and (4) many other\n\nsubstitute paperhandlers  were terminated over  the years for\n\nfailing to cover the job.\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nB.  The Proposed Amended Complaint\r            B.  The Proposed Amended Complaint\r                                              \n\n          Grant sought to  add to this case, via  the amended\n\ncomplaint, the following  claims:  (1) the  Herald refused to\n\npromote Grant  to  the  position  of  full-time  paperhandler\n\nbecause  of his  race;  (2) the  Herald  engaged in  unlawful\n\nretaliatory behavior  beyond terminating him; (3)  the Herald\n\nengaged  in unlawful  employment practices  which have  had a\n\ndisparate impact on qualified African Americans and qualified\n\nHispanic Americans as classes;  (4) the Herald engaged in  an\n\nunlawful,  race-motivated pattern  and  practice  of  hiring,\n\npromoting,  disciplining, and terminating  its substitute and\n\nfull-time paperhandlers; and (5)  the Herald denied Grant the\n\nright  to make  and enforce  contracts and  to enjoy  all the\n\nbenefits  of  a  contractual relationship  enjoyed  by  white\n\ncitizens.\n\n          The  following facts are  directly relevant  to the\n\nnew claims.  Grant asserts that they also constitute indirect\n\nevidence of  the claims set  forth in the  initial complaint.\n\nIn 1989, at the time of Grant's initial hiring, Grant was one\n\nof  only  two  African-American   employees  working  in  the\n\nHerald's pressroom.  The other  was his brother Jeffrey, from\n\nwhom he learned about  the position.  During that  same year,\n\nthere  were  a  total  of   147  employees  in  the  Herald's\n\npressroom.   The Herald has  not hired a  full-time, African-\n\nAmerican pressroom  employee since February 1987.   From 1989\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nthrough  the  present, a  period during  which the  number of\n\npressroom employees  has ranged  from 129 to  165, there  has\n\nbeen only  one full-time African-American  employee.   During\n\nthis   same  period,  there  have  been  no  African-American\n\npressroom supervisors.  \n\n          African Americans constitute 18.69% of those in the\n\nlocal labor market having the requisite skills for the job of\n\npaperhandler.  Despite this  fact, from December 1989 through\n\nApril  1994, the  Herald  hired at  least twenty-three  white\n\nsubstitute paperhandlers  and no African  Americans.   During\n\nthe same time period, the Herald promoted eight or more white\n\nsubstitute paperhandlers, and no  African-American substitute\n\npaperhandlers,  to  full-time status.    There  are no  women\n\nworking in the Herald's pressroom.\n\n          Robert  Reilly --  the pressroom  superintendent --\n\nhas  been solely responsible  for the  promotion, discipline,\n\nand discharge of all substitute paperhandlers since 1989.  He\n\nalso   has  been  solely  responsible  for  hiring  full-time\n\npaperhandlers.   By  his own  admission, Reilly  maintains no\n\nwritten criteria governing the  discipline and termination of\n\nsubstitute  paperhandlers.   Reilly maintains  that \"covering\n\nthe  job\"  takes  precedence  over   seniority  in  decisions\n\nregarding  whom to  promote to  full-time status.   At  least\n\ntwice --  in April 1990  (shortly after Grant  was terminated\n\nfor fighting with Joseph Gauthier) and October 1991 -- Reilly\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\npromoted white substitute  paperhandlers with less  seniority\n\nthan Grant.  Earlier  in 1991, Grant had protested  to Reilly\n\nthat the latter of these two paperhandlers was racist because\n\nhe and a co-worker left Grant a disproportionate share of the\n\nworkload.   Reilly had not seen any merit in Grant's protest.\n\nAfter  the October  1991  elevation of  the white  co-worker,\n\nGrant complained to  a union representative about his not yet\n\nhaving been promoted to full-time status.  Grant asserts that\n\nthis complaint not  only failed  to bear fruit,  but that  it\n\nalso resulted in the  December 1991-January 1992 reduction in\n\nhours he experienced.\n\n          The  only written  criterion  Reilly considered  in\n\ndetermining whom to promote was the substitute paperhandler's\n\ninitial  employment application.   This application requests,\n\ninter alia, that the applicant list all friends and relatives\r                      \n\nemployed by  the Herald.   The white  substitute paperhandler\n\npromoted  in  October  1991  had listed  four  relatives  and\n\nfriends on his employment  application; Grant had listed one.\n\nReilly admits that  word-of-mouth communication and  nepotism\n\nheavily   inform  who   learns  about   available  substitute\n\npaperhandler  positions  (which  are neither  advertised  nor\n\nposted).  Grant  maintains that the  same factors inform  the\n\npromotion of substitute paperhandlers to full-time status.\n\nC.  Procedural History\r            C.  Procedural History\r                                  \n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          On July  13, 1992, Grant filed  an MCAD/EEOC charge\n\nagainst   the  Herald  and   the  Boston  Newspaper  Printing\n\nPressmen's  Union  No. 3  (the  paperhandlers'  union).   The\n\ncharge alleged  that the Herald retaliated  against Grant and\n\nterminated his employment because  he is an African American;\n\nit  further   alleged  that  the  union   excluded  him  from\n\nmembership and  otherwise retaliated  against him  because of\n\nhis  race.   On April 29,  1993, with  the permission  of the\n\nMCAD,  plaintiff  initiated   this  action  in  Massachusetts\n\nSuperior  Court.  The union removed the case to federal court\n\nin late May 1993.  In August 1993, Grant dismissed all claims\n\nagainst the union.\n\n          The district court initially ordered that discovery\n\nbe completed  by February 28,  1994, and scheduled  the final\n\npretrial conference for March 21, 1994.  The court thereafter\n\ntwice  extended these  deadlines,  eventually  ordering  that\n\ndiscovery  close on May  30, 1994,  and scheduling  the final\n\npretrial conference for August 3, 1994.\n\n          On July 13, 1994, Grant served and filed his motion\n\nto amend the  complaint.  The amended complaint  increased by\n\neighty-seven  the  number  of   allegations  in  the  \"Facts\"\n\nsection.  It also added the five new legal theories set forth\n\nsupra.   The Herald  opposed this motion,  and simultaneously\r                 \n\nmoved  for summary judgment on the initial complaint.  At the\n\npretrial  conference  on August  3,  1994,  the court  orally\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\ndenied  the  motion  to amend.    On  November  7, 1994,  the\n\ndistrict  court  granted  the  Herald's  motion  for  summary\n\njudgment and denied Grant's motion for reconsideration of the\n\norder denying the motion to amend.  This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n          As stated above, Grant makes two basic arguments on\n\nappeal.  First, he asserts that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in not allowing  him to amend his complaint  so as\n\nto  press the  claims outlined  in Section  I-B.   Second, he\n\nargues that the court  erred in allowing the  Herald's motion\n\nfor summary judgment  on the claims outlined in  Section I-A.\n\nWe discuss each argument in turn.\n\nA.  The Motion to Amend\r            A.  The Motion to Amend\r                                   \n\n          The district  court denied Grant's motion  to amend\n\nfor two reasons.  First, the court stated that the motion was\n\nunduly late because  the court  was \"ready now  to deal  with\n\nthis  case after discovery is complete. . . .  If I allow the\n\nAmended Complaint, it brings theories into this case that are\n\ngoing  to delay it.  It is  like an entirely different case.\"\n\nSecond,  the court  indicated  that most  of the  newly-added\n\nclaims were  futile because Grant  had not presented  them in\n\nthe  first instance  to  the  MCAD.    Because  there  is  no\n\nreversible error in the court's lateness determination, we do\n\nnot reach the question of futility.    \n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          We  review a denial of leave to amend under Fed.

We are mindful, however,  of\n\nRule  15(a)'s admonition  that \"leave  shall be  freely given\n\nwhen  justice so requires.\"  Thus, unless there appears to be\n\nan  adequate reason for  the denial  (e.g., undue  delay, bad\n\nfaith, dilatory motive on the part of the movant, futility of\n\nthe  amendment), we will not affirm the denial.  See Foman v.\r                                                                      \n\nDavis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962).  \r                 \n\n          We also  are aware that Title  VII plaintiffs often\n\nlack  access  to  statistical  evidence such  as  the  racial\n\ncomposition of the  job applicant pool until  after they have\n\nfiled their  complaints and engaged  in discovery.   For this\n\nreason, we think that a denial of leave to amend to add Title\n\nVII claims  supported by statistics should  be evaluated with\n\nsome  caution.  Too  casual a review  of such a  denial might\n\nencourage  the   abandonment  of   (or  failure  to   pursue)\n\npotentially meritorious claims.  It might also precipitate an\n\nincrease in unsubstantiated pleading.

At the time Grant filed his motion,\n\ndiscovery was  already complete,  and Grant all  but concedes\n\nthat it  would have  to have been  reopened in order  for the\n\nHerald to defend itself  properly against the claims asserted\n\nin the amended  complaint.  Moreover,  the Herald had  nearly\n\ncompleted its motion for summary judgment and undoubtedly was\n\nwell  into  its  trial preparation.    When  these  facts are\n\nconsidered in  conjunction with  the radical remaking  of the\n\ncase  contemplated by the amended complaint, Grant's argument\n\nthat the Herald  would not have been  prejudiced by allowance\n\nof  the  amendment  rings  hollow.    Cf.  Tiernan  v.

Under this\n\ncircuit authority, it is incumbent upon Grant to give a valid\r                                                         \n\nreason for having waited so long to file his motion.  This he\n\nhas failed to do.\n\n          Grant  explains  the  lateness  of  his  motion  by\n\nasserting  that he  was \"stonewalled\"  by the  Herald in  his\n\neffort  to  obtain  documents  -- i.e.,  the  Herald's  EEO-1\n\nreports -- purportedly  underlying the five  new claims.   He\n\npoints  out that he did  not receive the  EEO-1 reports until\n\nJune 1994, and that  he filed the amended complaint  within a\n\nmonth  of  receiving them.   This  explanation fails  for two\n\nreasons.   First, the  Herald did not  stonewall Grant; Grant\n\ndid  not request the documents until April 28, 1994.  Grant's\n\nsuggestion  that  the  Herald  is responsible  for  the  late\n\nintroduction of  the  statistical evidence  derived from  the\n\nEEO-1 reports is therefore unjustified.\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n          Second,  Grant  clearly  possessed   the  knowledge\n\nnecessary  to  make the  claims he  sought  to assert  in the\n\namended complaint even without the EEO-1 reports.  Nothing in\n\nthe EEO-1  reports was  essential  to his  failure-to-promote\n\nclaim, for  example.  Grant  acknowledges as much  by arguing\n\nthat the  failure-to-promote claim  actually was  included in\n\nthe original complaint.   And Grant cannot claim that  he was\n\nunaware, prior to receiving the EEO-1 reports, of the general\n\nracial composition of the pressroom staff, the discretion the\n\nHerald invested in  Robert Reilly  on matters  of hiring  and\n\npromotion, the lack  of written criteria to guide  hiring and\n\npromotion decisions,  the nepotism  that pervaded the  Herald\n\npressroom's  hiring  practices,  or  the  identity  of  those\n\npersons actually promoted to  full-time status during Grant's\n\nperiods of  employment.  This simply is  not a case where the\n\nplaintiff could not, without risking sanctions,  have pleaded\n\nthe late-added claims until after, or at least well into, the\n\ndiscovery process.   Grant  was aware,  or  should have  been\n\naware,  of  information tending  to support  each of  the new\n\nclaims well before July 1994.  Cf. Baumann  et al., supra, at\r                                                                     \n\n289-96 (discussing the  danger Fed.  R. Civ. P.  11 poses  to\n\nTitle VII plaintiffs who do not plead carefully).\n\n          For all  these reasons, the district  court did not\n\nabuse  its discretion in denying Grant's  motion to amend the\n\ncomplaint on lateness grounds.\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nB.

In so doing, the court ruled that the Herald\n\nhad  articulated  a legitimate,  non-discriminatory  and non-\n\nretaliatory reason  for Grant's  termination, and that  Grant\n\nhad failed to demonstrate  a triable issue as to  whether the\n\nHerald's justification was pretextual.   Although the court's\n\nanalysis overlooked one of Grant's  claims -- i.e., that  the\n\nreduction  in hours Grant  suffered in  December 1991-January\n\n1992  was  motivated by  racial discrimination  -- we  see no\n\nerror in the award of summary judgment.\n\n          There is no  dispute over whether Grant  has made a\n\nprima  facie case  of  racial discrimination  or whether  the\n\nHerald,  by pointing  to  Grant's  excessive absenteeism  and\n\nunavailability for work,  has articulated a legitimate,  non-\n\ndiscriminatory   and   non-retaliatory  reason   for  Grant's\n\ntermination.

Thus, we\r                                        \n\nrestrict our inquiry to  whether the district court correctly\n\nconcluded  that the  evidence,  construed in  the light  most\n\nfavorable to Grant, would not  allow a factfinder to conclude\n\nthat Grant's race or a retaliatory animus on the part  of the\n\nHerald was a  motivating factor in  Grant's termination.   We\n\nbelieve that the district court's conclusion was correct.  \n\n          We  point out  that the  Herald has done  more than\n\narticulate  a   reason  for   Grant's  termination;  it   has\n\nintroduced  significant  evidence  tending  to  establish the\n\nreason's veracity.   Not  only does the  documentary evidence\n\nconfirm that, during the relevant time period, Grant had  the\n\npoorest overall record  for covering  the job of  any of  the\n\nHerald's  substitute paperhandlers,  it  also indicates  that\n\nReilly  subsequently terminated the two white co-workers with\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nthe most  similar job-coverage  records -- the  co-workers to\n\nwhom Grant compares himself in making his disparate treatment\n\nargument -- for failing to cover  the job.  The evidence also\n\nreveals  that  many   other  substitute  paperhandlers   were\n\nterminated over the years for failing  to cover the job.   In\n\nlight of  the  evidence  of  the Herald's  refusal  to  abide\n\nsubstitute  paperhandlers  who  fail  to cover  the  job  and\n\nGrant's  very  poor   job-coverage  record,  Grant  faces   a\n\nformidable hurdle in arguing  that the Herald's stated reason\n\nfor his termination was pretextual.\n\n          Grant  seeks  to support  his  pretext argument  in\n\nthree specific  ways.   First, he  points to  the statistical\n\nevidence  summarized  in  Section  1-B, arguing  that  it  is\n\nindirect proof  of Reilly's discriminatory animus.   Next, he\n\nrecites  three  allegedly  discriminatory  actions  taken  by\n\nReilly, again arguing that they constitute  indirect evidence\n\nof Reilly's discriminatory animus.  Third, he asserts that he\n\nwas  treated  differently  than  two  white  co-workers  with\n\n\"similar  or worse  attendance records  from January  6, 1991\n\nthrough February  21, 1992.\"   We already  have rejected  the\n\nlast of these three  arguments.  It bears repeating  that the\n\nrecord,  read   in  the   light  most  favorable   to  Grant,\n\nconclusively establishes  that Grant failed to  cover the job\n\nmore  often during  the  relevant time  period  than the  two\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\n(subsequently  terminated) co-workers  to  whom  he  compares\n\nhimself.  \n\n          We therefore focus on Grant's first two  arguments,\n\ndisregarding other arguments made only in Grant's reply brief\n\nand/or  which fall  outside  the  parameters  established  by\n\nGrant's complaint.   See, e.g., Sandstrom  v. Chemlawn Corp.,\r                                                                        \n\n904 F.2d 83, 86  (1st Cir. 1990) (deeming waived  an argument\n\nnot  made below or  in appellant's opening  brief); Mack, 871\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d  at  183-84  (emphasizing  that  unpleaded   claims  and\n\ntheories will be subject to preclusion).  We note in passing,\n\nhowever,  that,  had  they  been  properly  preserved,  these\n\narguments would not have affected our conclusion that summary\n\njudgment was correctly entered for the Herald.\n\n          As we  have  stated, Grant's  statistical  evidence\n\ndoes  paint a  disturbing picture  of the  Herald's pressroom\n\nhiring practices and  their possible effects.  It is apparent\n\nthat   qualified   African   Americans    are   significantly\n\nunderrepresented in the Herald's pressroom.  Moreover, Robert\n\nReilly concedes that word-of-mouth communication and nepotism\n\nplay a large role in determining who learns about and obtains\n\navailable paperhandler positions.  Finally, in response to an\n\ninquiry posed  at his  deposition, Reilly, who  enjoys nearly\n\nunfettered discretion over pressroom hiring, expressed little\n\nor no  concern about the exclusionary  effect these facially-\n\nneutral practices might be  having on potential applicants of\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\ncolor.  We  think it  important for the  Herald to  recognize\n\nthat the facial  neutrality of such hiring policies  does not\n\nnecessarily  take them outside the  reach of Title  VII.  See\r                                                                         \n\nEEOC  v.

Bd., 915 F.2d 922,\r                                                          \n\n925 (4th Cir. 1990)) (evaluating disparate impact claim).\n\n          The  fact of the matter is, though, that we are not\n\nevaluating a disparate impact,  or a failure-to-hire, or even\n\na  failure-to-promote claim;  we  are  considering whether  a\n\nrational jury could find, by a preponderance of the evidence,\n\nthat  the Herald  is lying  when it  says that  it terminated\n\nGrant  because of  his  failure to  cover  the job  (and  not\r                                                                         \n\nbecause  of  his  race  or  his  engagement  in  statutorily-\n\nprotected  activities).   In  our  view, Grant's  statistical\n\nevidence --  whether considered alone or  in conjunction with\n\nthe  other evidence  we  will  discuss  infra  --  is  not  a\r                                                         \n\nsufficient foundation upon which a  jury could premise such a\n\nfinding.    While the  evidence does  tend  to show  that the\n\nHerald's  hiring policies, as  implemented by  Robert Reilly,\n\noperate to  exclude African  Americans from the  hiring pool,\n\nand  while it may allow  for a reasonable  inference that the\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nHerald and Reilly are insensitive to the need to provide fair\n\nand  equal access to  its pressroom employment opportunities,\n\nit is inadequate to prove that Reilly takes race into account\n\n(or,  for that  matter,  that Reilly  takes participation  in\n\nprotected activities  into account)  when he makes  discharge\n\ndecisions.   Along these lines, we  note that Grant's brother\n\nobtained full-time  status and apparently still  works at the\n\nHerald.  More to the point, this evidence in no way undercuts\n\nthe Herald's evidence that a willingness and ability to cover\n\nthe  job  is  the   foremost  quality  sought  in  substitute\n\npaperhandlers,  and that  Grant  and others  who lacked  this\n\nquality were terminated precisely because they lacked it.\n\n          Grant's  second  argument,  that   three  allegedly\n\ndiscriminatory actions  taken by Reilly prove  illicit motive\n\nin Grant's termination,  also fails.   We do  not think  that\n\ntwo, if  not  all  three, of  the  delineated  actions  could\n\nreasonably be  considered discriminatory.   And even  if they\n\ncould  be  so considered,  we do  not  believe that  they are\n\nsufficient to call into  question the non-discriminatory  and\n\nnon-retaliatory explanation the Herald  has given for Grant's\n\ntermination:  that Grant was not covering the job.\n\n          The first  of the three actions Grant  points to --\n\nthat Reilly fired Grant while only suspending Joseph Gauthier\n\nafter their April 1990 fight (and shortly thereafter promoted\n\na white substitute  with less seniority  than Grant to  full-\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\ntime status) -- is  at least plausibly explained by  the fact\n\nthat   Gauthier,  as  a   union  employee,   enjoyed  greater\n\nprocedural protections than did  Grant, and by the allegation\n\nthat  Grant was  already on  shaky ground  because of  a poor\n\nattendance record prior  to the  fight.  The  second --  that\n\nReilly found unworthy of  credence Grant's complaint that two\n\nco-workers  were racists who gave him too much work (and that\n\nReilly subsequently promoted one of these co-workers to full-\n\ntime status) -- is  so sparsely explained and supported  that\n\nno  rational factfinder  could find  racism on  Reilly's part\n\nbased  on the record  evidence.  Similarly,  the third (which\n\ncoincides  with the  claim that  the district  court did  not\n\nexplicitly consider  in its  summary judgment order)  -- that\n\nReilly  reduced  Grant's  work  hours in  December  1991  and\n\nJanuary 1992 because of Grant's race -- is unsupported by any\n\nevidence  to this  effect.   The fact  that, during  the same\n\nperiod,  a  pressroom  supervisor  informed  Grant  that   no\n\nsubstitutes were getting any  hours when, in fact, two  white\n\nsubstitutes  were getting  hours is  not probative  of racial\n\ndiscrimination  on Reilly's  part.   Daniel Messing,  and not\n\nReilly,  was  the pressroom  supervisor  who  gave Grant  the\n\nincorrect information,  and there is no reason  to infer that\n\nMessing misinformed Grant at Reilly's direction.\n\n          Because Grant  has failed to  demonstrate that  the\n\nHerald's  stated justification  for  the  adverse  employment\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nactions  of which  he complains  is pretextual,  the district\n\ncourt  did not err in granting the Herald summary judgment on\n\nGrant's  federal  and  state discrimination  and  retaliation\n\nclaims.\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \n\n          For  the  reasons  stated   above,  we  affirm  the\n\ndistrict court's  entry of  summary judgment in  the Herald's\n\nfavor.

The Initial Complaint\r            A.  The Initial Complaint\r                                     \n\n          The initial complaint made the following claims:  \n\n(1) the  Herald reduced  Grant's hours  in December  1991 and\n\nJanuary 1992  because of his race; (2)  the Herald terminated\n\nGrant  as  a  substitute  paperhandler in  February  1992  in\n\nretaliation for his complaining about this reduction in hours\n\nand other alleged  acts of discrimination; and (3) the Herald\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nterminated  Grant  as a  substitute paperhandler  in February\n\n1992   because  of  his  race.    In  so  characterizing  the\n\ncomplaint,  we  obviously  reject  Grant's  argument  that it\n\nstated  a claim that the Herald refused to promote Grant from\n\nthe   position  of   substitute  paperhandler   to  full-time\n\npaperhandler  because of his race.   Nothing in the complaint\n\neven  remotely intimates  that this  is a  failure-to-promote\n\ncase.  See Mack  v. Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co., Inc.,\r                                                                        \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520577\"><a href=\"/opinion/520577/thomasina-mack-v-the-great-atlantic-and-pacific-tea-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 183-84 (1st Cir. 1989) (warning the bar that we\n\nwill  hold  litigants to  their  duty \"to  spell  out [their]\n\ntheories clearly and distinctly  before the nisi prius court,\n\non pain of preclusion\"). \n\n          The following  facts are  directly relevant  to the\n\nclaims made in the initial complaint.  Grant began working as\n\na substitute paperhandler in  November 1989, after he learned\n\nof  the position from his brother Jeffrey, who is a full-time\n\nemployee of the Herald.  A substitute paperhandler is a part-\n\ntime  employee   who  does  the  same  work  as  a  full-time\n\npaperhandler  -- moving  large rolls  of  newsprint, removing\n\nwrapper  heads  from  the  rolls, bringing  plates  from  the\n\npressroom to the  presses, and cleaning the  pressroom -- but\n\nworks only on an as-needed basis.  A substitute  paperhandler\n\ndoes  not need  a high  school diploma,  technical vocational\n\ntraining, or other education.  He is an at-will employee and,\n\nunlike  full-time paperhandlers (who are unionized), does not\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nhave employee benefits such as paid vacation leave, sick pay,\n\nor health  insurance.   Of paramount concern to the Herald is\n\na substitute  paperhandler's willingness and  availability to\n\n\"cover the job\"  -- i.e., to work when scheduled or called at\n\nthe  last minute.    As Grant  himself  admits, there  is  an\n\nexpectation  that substitutes  will \"never  say no\"  and that\n\nthey will show up at work \"dead or alive.\"\n\n          The   Herald  has  several   methods  of  notifying\n\nsubstitute paperhandlers to come  to work.  If the  pressroom\n\nsuperintendent, Robert Reilly, knows  in advance that he will\n\nneed substitutes,  he posts a list  -- the \"work list\"  -- of\n\nthe  substitutes  who are  scheduled to  work  each day  of a\n\nparticular  week.   Sometimes, he includes  next to  the work\n\nlist  a  \"next  list,\"  which contains  the  names  of  those\n\nsubstitutes  who will  be  called at  the  last minute  if  a\n\npreviously  scheduled full-time or substitute paperhandler is\n\nabsent.  Also, substitutes  are told that if they  want work,\n\nthey should call the  Herald before the beginning of  a shift\n\nto see if there are any openings.\n\n          Grant had two tenures  as a substitute paperhandler\n\nat  the Herald.  The  first, which lasted  from November 1989\n\nthrough  April  1990, ended  when  Reilly  terminated Grant's\n\nemployment after  a fight with a  full-time, white co-worker,\n\nJoseph  Gauthier.   During  the course  of this  altercation,\n\nGauthier  subjected Grant  to racial  slurs and  spat  in his\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nface.    Although  Reilly  fired  Grant,  he  only  suspended\n\nGauthier.  The Herald explains this differential treatment in\n\ntwo ways.   First, Gauthier, as a union member,  could not be\n\nterminated without  cause, and  was entitled to  certain pre-\n\ntermination procedures set forth in the collective bargaining\n\nagreement.   Second, Reilly allegedly had  warned Grant a few\n\ntimes  about failing  to cover  the job,  and  viewed Grant's\n\ninvolvement in the altercation as \"the last straw.\"\n\n          Subsequent  to his  April  1990 termination,  Grant\n\nwent to the  Massachusetts Commission Against  Discrimination\n\n(\"MCAD\") and charged  the Herald with  racial discrimination.\n\nOn  January 11,  1991,  Grant  and the  Herald  settled  this\n\ncharge.   As part  of  the settlement  agreement, the  Herald\n\nrestored Grant  to the substitute paperhandler  list and paid\n\nhim a sum  of money.  In return, Grant  agreed to release the\n\nHerald  from all claims arising out of his employment to that\n\npoint  in time.   Grant  returned to  his former  position on\n\nJanuary 14, 1991.\n\n          Although  Grant always  performed his  duties well,\n\nhis   ability  and   willingness  to   cover  the   job  were\n\nconsistently at  issue.   From January 1991  through December\n\n1991, there were nine occasions on which Grant was  scheduled\n\nin  advance to  cover  a shift  but failed  to come  to work.\n\nWithout  notice,   Reilly  discontinued  using   Grant  as  a\n\nsubstitute in December 1991.   When Grant inquired as  to why\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nhe  was  no  longer  getting  any hours,  Daniel  Messing,  a\n\npressroom  supervisor, informed him  that no substitutes were\n\ngetting any hours.   Grant  then checked the  work lists  and\n\ndiscovered  that, in fact, two white substitute paperhandlers\n\nwere working.       Grant thereafter requested a meeting with\n\nReilly and, on January 21, 1992, Grant and Reilly convened to\n\ndiscuss Grant's work status.  At that meeting, it was decided\n\nthat  Grant would be put back on  the substitute list.  Grant\n\nworked nine times in the  next few weeks, but then failed  to\n\nappear  on February 12, 1992  and called in  sick on February\n\n20, 1992.  By letter dated February 21, 1992, Reilly informed\n\nGrant  that he would be  removed from the  list of substitute\n\nworkers.   Although  Grant labors  mightily to  circumvent or\n\nobscure some basic facts,  the record reveals:  (1)  no other\n\nsubstitute  paperhandler  failed to  cover an  assigned shift\n\nmore  frequently than  Grant during  the period  from January\n\n1991 through  February 1992;  (2) Grant often failed  to work\n\nwhen his name  was on the next list  during this same period;\n\n(3) the  two white substitute paperhandlers with job-coverage\n\nrecords most similar  to Grant's (and to whom  Grant compares\n\nhimself  in making  his  disparate  treatment argument)  were\n\nterminated   in  the   fifteen   months   following   Grant's\n\ntermination  for failing to cover the job; and (4) many other\n\nsubstitute paperhandlers  were terminated over  the years for\n\nfailing to cover the job.\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nB.  The Proposed Amended Complaint\r            B.  The Proposed Amended Complaint\r                                              \n\n          Grant sought to  add to this case, via  the amended\n\ncomplaint, the following  claims:  (1) the  Herald refused to\n\npromote Grant  to  the  position  of  full-time  paperhandler\n\nbecause  of his  race;  (2) the  Herald  engaged in  unlawful\n\nretaliatory behavior  beyond terminating him; (3)  the Herald\n\nengaged  in unlawful  employment practices  which have  had a\n\ndisparate impact on qualified African Americans and qualified\n\nHispanic Americans as classes;  (4) the Herald engaged in  an\n\nunlawful,  race-motivated pattern  and  practice  of  hiring,\n\npromoting,  disciplining, and terminating  its substitute and\n\nfull-time paperhandlers; and (5)  the Herald denied Grant the\n\nright  to make  and enforce  contracts and  to enjoy  all the\n\nbenefits  of  a  contractual relationship  enjoyed  by  white\n\ncitizens.\n\n          The  following facts are  directly relevant  to the\n\nnew claims.  Grant asserts that they also constitute indirect\n\nevidence of  the claims set  forth in the  initial complaint.\n\nIn 1989, at the time of Grant's initial hiring, Grant was one\n\nof  only  two  African-American   employees  working  in  the\n\nHerald's pressroom.  The other  was his brother Jeffrey, from\n\nwhom he learned about  the position.  During that  same year,\n\nthere  were  a  total  of   147  employees  in  the  Herald's\n\npressroom.   The Herald has  not hired a  full-time, African-\n\nAmerican pressroom  employee since February 1987.   From 1989\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nthrough  the  present, a  period during  which the  number of\n\npressroom employees  has ranged  from 129 to  165, there  has\n\nbeen only  one full-time African-American  employee.   During\n\nthis   same  period,  there  have  been  no  African-American\n\npressroom supervisors.  \n\n          African Americans constitute 18.69% of those in the\n\nlocal labor market having the requisite skills for the job of\n\npaperhandler.  Despite this  fact, from December 1989 through\n\nApril  1994, the  Herald  hired at  least twenty-three  white\n\nsubstitute paperhandlers  and no African  Americans.   During\n\nthe same time period, the Herald promoted eight or more white\n\nsubstitute paperhandlers, and no  African-American substitute\n\npaperhandlers,  to  full-time status.    There  are no  women\n\nworking in the Herald's pressroom.\n\n          Robert  Reilly --  the pressroom  superintendent --\n\nhas  been solely responsible  for the  promotion, discipline,\n\nand discharge of all substitute paperhandlers since 1989.  He\n\nalso   has  been  solely  responsible  for  hiring  full-time\n\npaperhandlers.   By  his own  admission, Reilly  maintains no\n\nwritten criteria governing the  discipline and termination of\n\nsubstitute  paperhandlers.   Reilly maintains  that \"covering\n\nthe  job\"  takes  precedence  over   seniority  in  decisions\n\nregarding  whom to  promote to  full-time status.   At  least\n\ntwice --  in April 1990  (shortly after Grant  was terminated\n\nfor fighting with Joseph Gauthier) and October 1991 -- Reilly\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\npromoted white substitute  paperhandlers with less  seniority\n\nthan Grant.  Earlier  in 1991, Grant had protested  to Reilly\n\nthat the latter of these two paperhandlers was racist because\n\nhe and a co-worker left Grant a disproportionate share of the\n\nworkload.   Reilly had not seen any merit in Grant's protest.\n\nAfter  the October  1991  elevation of  the white  co-worker,\n\nGrant complained to  a union representative about his not yet\n\nhaving been promoted to full-time status.  Grant asserts that\n\nthis complaint not  only failed  to bear fruit,  but that  it\n\nalso resulted in the  December 1991-January 1992 reduction in\n\nhours he experienced.\n\n          The  only written  criterion  Reilly considered  in\n\ndetermining whom to promote was the substitute paperhandler's\n\ninitial  employment application.   This application requests,\n\ninter alia, that the applicant list all friends and relatives\r                      \n\nemployed by  the Herald.   The white  substitute paperhandler\n\npromoted  in  October  1991  had listed  four  relatives  and\n\nfriends on his employment  application; Grant had listed one.\n\nReilly admits that  word-of-mouth communication and  nepotism\n\nheavily   inform  who   learns  about   available  substitute\n\npaperhandler  positions  (which  are neither  advertised  nor\n\nposted).  Grant  maintains that the  same factors inform  the\n\npromotion of substitute paperhandlers to full-time status.\n\nC.  Procedural History\r            C.  Procedural History\r                                  \n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          On July  13, 1992, Grant filed  an MCAD/EEOC charge\n\nagainst   the  Herald  and   the  Boston  Newspaper  Printing\n\nPressmen's  Union  No. 3  (the  paperhandlers'  union).   The\n\ncharge alleged  that the Herald retaliated  against Grant and\n\nterminated his employment because  he is an African American;\n\nit  further   alleged  that  the  union   excluded  him  from\n\nmembership and  otherwise retaliated  against him  because of\n\nhis  race.   On April 29,  1993, with  the permission  of the\n\nMCAD,  plaintiff  initiated   this  action  in  Massachusetts\n\nSuperior  Court.  The union removed the case to federal court\n\nin late May 1993.  In August 1993, Grant dismissed all claims\n\nagainst the union.\n\n          The district court initially ordered that discovery\n\nbe completed  by February 28,  1994, and scheduled  the final\n\npretrial conference for March 21, 1994.  The court thereafter\n\ntwice  extended these  deadlines,  eventually  ordering  that\n\ndiscovery  close on May  30, 1994,  and scheduling  the final\n\npretrial conference for August 3, 1994.\n\n          On July 13, 1994, Grant served and filed his motion\n\nto amend the  complaint.  The amended complaint  increased by\n\neighty-seven  the  number  of   allegations  in  the  \"Facts\"\n\nsection.  It also added the five new legal theories set </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">forth</span>\n\nsupra</span><pre class=\"inline\">.   The Herald  opposed this motion,  and simultaneously\r                 \n\nmoved  for summary judgment on the initial complaint.  At the\n\npretrial  conference  on August  3,  1994,  the court  orally\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\ndenied  the  motion  to amend.    On  November  7, 1994,  the\n\ndistrict  court  granted  the  Herald's  motion  for  summary\n\njudgment and denied Grant's motion for reconsideration of the\n\norder denying the motion to amend.  This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n          As stated above, Grant makes two basic arguments on\n\nappeal.  First, he asserts that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in not allowing  him to amend his complaint  so as\n\nto  press the  claims outlined  in Section  I-B.   Second, he\n\nargues that the court  erred in allowing the  Herald's motion\n\nfor summary judgment  on the claims outlined in  Section I-A.\n\nWe discuss each argument in turn.\n\nA.  The Motion to Amend\r            A.  The Motion to Amend\r                                   \n\n          The district  court denied Grant's motion  to amend\n\nfor two reasons.  First, the court stated that the motion was\n\nunduly late because  the court  was \"ready now  to deal  with\n\nthis  case after discovery is complete. . . .  If I allow the\n\nAmended Complaint, it brings theories into this case that are\n\ngoing  to delay it.  It is  like an entirely different case.\"\n\nSecond,  the court  indicated  that most  of the  newly-added\n\nclaims were  futile because Grant  had not presented  them in\n\nthe  first instance  to  the  MCAD.    Because  there  is  no\n\nreversible error in the court's lateness determination, we do\n\nnot reach the question of futility.    \n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          We  review a denial of leave to amend under Fed. R.\n\nCiv.  P. 15  for an  abuse of  discretion,  and defer  to the\n\ndistrict  court if  any  adequate reason  for  the denial  is\n\napparent on the record.   Resolution Trust Corp. v.

Moreover,  the Herald had  nearly\n\ncompleted its motion for summary judgment and undoubtedly was\n\nwell  into  its  trial preparation.

This he\n\nhas failed to do.\n\n          Grant  explains  the  lateness  of  his  motion  by\n\nasserting  that he  was \"stonewalled\"  by the  Herald in  his\n\neffort  to  obtain  documents  -- i.e.,  the  Herald's  EEO-1\n\nreports -- purportedly  underlying the five  new claims.   He\n\npoints  out that he did  not receive the  EEO-1 reports until\n\nJune 1994, and that  he filed the amended complaint  within a\n\nmonth  of  receiving them.   This  explanation fails  for two\n\nreasons.   First, the  Herald did not  stonewall Grant; Grant\n\ndid  not request the documents until April 28, 1994.  Grant's\n\nsuggestion  that  the  Herald  is responsible  for  the  late\n\nintroduction of  the  statistical evidence  derived from  the\n\nEEO-1 reports is therefore unjustified.\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n          Second,  Grant  clearly  possessed   the  knowledge\n\nnecessary  to  make the  claims he  sought  to assert  in the\n\namended complaint even without the EEO-1 reports.  Nothing in\n\nthe EEO-1  reports was  essential  to his  failure-to-promote\n\nclaim, for  example.  Grant  acknowledges as much  by arguing\n\nthat the  failure-to-promote claim  actually was  included in\n\nthe original complaint.   And Grant cannot claim that  he was\n\nunaware, prior to receiving the EEO-1 reports, of the general\n\nracial composition of the pressroom staff, the discretion the\n\nHerald invested in  Robert Reilly  on matters  of hiring  and\n\npromotion, the lack  of written criteria to guide  hiring and\n\npromotion decisions,  the nepotism  that pervaded the  Herald\n\npressroom's  hiring  practices,  or  the  identity  of  those\n\npersons actually promoted to  full-time status during Grant's\n\nperiods of  employment.  This simply is  not a case where the\n\nplaintiff could not, without risking sanctions,  have pleaded\n\nthe late-added claims until after, or at least well into, the\n\ndiscovery process.   Grant  was aware,  or  should have  been\n\naware,  of  information tending  to support  each of  the new\n\nclaims well before July 1994.  Cf.

Although the court's\n\nanalysis overlooked one of Grant's  claims -- i.e., that  the\n\nreduction  in hours Grant  suffered in  December 1991-January\n\n1992  was  motivated by  racial discrimination  -- we  see no\n\nerror in the award of summary judgment.\n\n          There is no  dispute over whether Grant  has made a\n\nprima  facie case  of  racial discrimination  or whether  the\n\nHerald,  by pointing  to  Grant's  excessive absenteeism  and\n\nunavailability for work,  has articulated a legitimate,  non-\n\ndiscriminatory   and   non-retaliatory  reason   for  Grant's\n\ntermination.

Thus, we\r                                        \n\nrestrict our inquiry to  whether the district court correctly\n\nconcluded  that the  evidence,  construed in  the light  most\n\nfavorable to Grant, would not  allow a factfinder to conclude\n\nthat Grant's race or a retaliatory animus on the part  of the\n\nHerald was a  motivating factor in  Grant's termination.   We\n\nbelieve that the district court's conclusion was correct.  \n\n          We  point out  that the  Herald has done  more than\n\narticulate  a   reason  for   Grant's  termination;  it   has\n\nintroduced  significant  evidence  tending  to  establish the\n\nreason's veracity.   Not  only does the  documentary evidence\n\nconfirm that, during the relevant time period, Grant had  the\n\npoorest overall record  for covering  the job of  any of  the\n\nHerald's  substitute paperhandlers,  it  also indicates  that\n\nReilly  subsequently terminated the two white co-workers with\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nthe most  similar job-coverage  records -- the  co-workers to\n\nwhom Grant compares himself in making his disparate treatment\n\nargument -- for failing to cover  the job.  The evidence also\n\nreveals  that  many   other  substitute  paperhandlers   were\n\nterminated over the years for failing  to cover the job.   In\n\nlight of  the  evidence  of  the Herald's  refusal  to  abide\n\nsubstitute  paperhandlers  who  fail  to cover  the  job  and\n\nGrant's  very  poor   job-coverage  record,  Grant  faces   a\n\nformidable hurdle in arguing  that the Herald's stated reason\n\nfor his termination was pretextual.\n\n          Grant  seeks  to support  his  pretext argument  in\n\nthree specific  ways.   First, he  points to  the statistical\n\nevidence  summarized  in  Section  1-B, arguing  that  it  is\n\nindirect proof  of Reilly's discriminatory animus.   Next, he\n\nrecites  three  allegedly  discriminatory  actions  taken  by\n\nReilly, again arguing that they constitute  indirect evidence\n\nof Reilly's discriminatory animus.  Third, he asserts that he\n\nwas  treated  differently  than  two  white  co-workers  with\n\n\"similar  or worse  attendance records  from January  6, 1991\n\nthrough February  21, 1992.\"   We already  have rejected  the\n\nlast of these three  arguments.  It bears repeating  that the\n\nrecord,  read   in  the   light  most  favorable   to  Grant,\n\nconclusively establishes  that Grant failed to  cover the job\n\nmore  often during  the  relevant time  period  than the  two\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\n(subsequently  terminated) co-workers  to  whom  he  compares\n\nhimself.  \n\n          We therefore focus on Grant's first two  arguments,\n\ndisregarding other arguments made only in Grant's reply brief\n\nand/or  which fall  outside  the  parameters  established  by\n\nGrant's complaint.

We note in passing,\n\nhowever,  that,  had  they  been  properly  preserved,  these\n\narguments would not have affected our conclusion that summary\n\njudgment was correctly entered for the Herald.\n\n          As we  have  stated, Grant's  statistical  evidence\n\ndoes  paint a  disturbing picture  of the  Herald's pressroom\n\nhiring practices and  their possible effects.  It is apparent\n\nthat   qualified   African   Americans    are   significantly\n\nunderrepresented in the Herald's pressroom.  Moreover, Robert\n\nReilly concedes that word-of-mouth communication and nepotism\n\nplay a large role in determining who learns about and obtains\n\navailable paperhandler positions.  Finally, in response to an\n\ninquiry posed  at his  deposition, Reilly, who  enjoys nearly\n\nunfettered discretion over pressroom hiring, expressed little\n\nor no  concern about the exclusionary  effect these facially-\n\nneutral practices might be  having on potential applicants of\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\ncolor.  We  think it  important for the  Herald to  recognize\n\nthat the facial  neutrality of such hiring policies  does not\n\nnecessarily  take them outside the  reach of Title  VII.

Washington County Sch. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548949\"><a href=\"/opinion/548949/patricia-a-thomas-v-washington-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r                                                          \n\n925 (4th Cir. 1990)) (evaluating disparate impact claim).\n\n          The  fact of the matter is, though, that we are not\n\nevaluating a disparate impact,  or a failure-to-hire, or even\n\na  failure-to-promote claim;  we  are  considering whether  a\n\nrational jury could find, by a preponderance of the evidence,\n\nthat  the Herald  is lying  when it  says that  it terminated\n\nGrant  because of  his  failure to  cover  the job  (and  not\r                                                                         \n\nbecause  of  his  race  or  his  engagement  in  statutorily-\n\nprotected  activities).   In  our  view, Grant's  statistical\n\nevidence --  whether considered alone or  in conjunction with\n\nthe  other evidence  we  will  discuss  infra  --  is  not  a\r                                                         \n\nsufficient foundation upon which a  jury could premise such a\n\nfinding.    While the  evidence does  tend  to show  that the\n\nHerald's  hiring policies, as  implemented by  Robert Reilly,\n\noperate to  exclude African  Americans from the  hiring pool,\n\nand  while it may allow  for a reasonable  inference that the\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nHerald and Reilly are insensitive to the need to provide fair\n\nand  equal access to  its pressroom employment opportunities,\n\nit is inadequate to prove that Reilly takes race into account\n\n(or,  for that  matter,  that Reilly  takes participation  in\n\nprotected activities  into account)  when he makes  discharge\n\ndecisions.   Along these lines, we  note that Grant's brother\n\nobtained full-time  status and apparently still  works at the\n\nHerald.  More to the point, this evidence in no way undercuts\n\nthe Herald's evidence that a willingness and ability to cover\n\nthe  job  is  the   foremost  quality  sought  in  substitute\n\npaperhandlers,  and that  Grant  and others  who lacked  this\n\nquality were terminated precisely because they lacked it.\n\n          Grant's  second  argument,  that   three  allegedly\n\ndiscriminatory actions  taken by Reilly prove  illicit motive\n\nin Grant's termination,  also fails.   We do  not think  that\n\ntwo, if  not  all  three, of  the  delineated  actions  could\n\nreasonably be  considered discriminatory.   And even  if they\n\ncould  be  so considered,  we do  not  believe that  they are\n\nsufficient to call into  question the non-discriminatory  and\n\nnon-retaliatory explanation the Herald  has given for Grant's\n\ntermination:  that Grant was not covering the job.\n\n          The first  of the three actions Grant  points to --\n\nthat Reilly fired Grant while only suspending Joseph Gauthier\n\nafter their April 1990 fight (and shortly thereafter promoted\n\na white substitute  with less seniority  than Grant to  full-\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\ntime status) -- is  at least plausibly explained by  the fact\n\nthat   Gauthier,  as  a   union  employee,   enjoyed  greater\n\nprocedural protections than did  Grant, and by the allegation\n\nthat  Grant was  already on  shaky ground  because of  a poor\n\nattendance record prior  to the  fight.  The  second --  that\n\nReilly found unworthy of  credence Grant's complaint that two\n\nco-workers  were racists who gave him too much work (and that\n\nReilly subsequently promoted one of these co-workers to full-\n\ntime status) -- is  so sparsely explained and supported  that\n\nno  rational factfinder  could find  racism on  Reilly's part\n\nbased  on the record  evidence.  Similarly,  the third (which\n\ncoincides  with the  claim that  the district  court did  not\n\nexplicitly consider  in its  summary judgment order)  -- that\n\nReilly  reduced  Grant's  work  hours in  December  1991  and\n\nJanuary 1992 because of Grant's race -- is unsupported by any\n\nevidence  to this  effect.   The fact  that, during  the same\n\nperiod,  a  pressroom  supervisor  informed  Grant  that   no\n\nsubstitutes were getting any  hours when, in fact, two  white\n\nsubstitutes  were getting  hours is  not probative  of racial\n\ndiscrimination  on Reilly's  part.   Daniel Messing,  and not\n\nReilly,  was  the pressroom  supervisor  who  gave Grant  the\n\nincorrect information,  and there is no reason  to infer that\n\nMessing misinformed Grant at Reilly's direction.\n\n          Because Grant  has failed to  demonstrate that  the\n\nHerald's  stated justification  for  the  adverse  employment\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nactions  of which  he complains  is pretextual,  the district\n\ncourt  did not err in granting the Herald summary judgment on\n\nGrant's  federal  and  state discrimination  and  retaliation\n\nclaims.\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \n\n          For  the  reasons  stated   above,  we  affirm  the\n\ndistrict court's  entry of  summary judgment in  the Herald's\n\nfavor.
