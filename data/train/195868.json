Leonard  Friedman  is  appealing the\r                                 \n\ndistrict  court's decision dismissing  his case for mootness.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n          I.  Background\r                                    \n\n          We  recite only  briefly the  pertinent facts.   In\n\n1991,  Friedman sued  various defendants,  claiming that  the\n\nrevocation of  his medical  license in Massachusetts  in 1987\n\nand  his exclusion from  Medicare provider rolls  in 1990 had\n\nbeen   unlawfully  effected.     The  district  court  stayed\n\nproceedings pending  the results  of other state  and federal\n\ncourt actions involving  the same parties.  In  October 1993,\n\nthe  court  approved  the  parties'  stipulation  of  partial\n\ndismissal.  Pursuant to  that stipulation, Friedman dismissed\n\nwith prejudice  his claims against all  defendants except his\n\nclaim  against the  Department of  Health and  Human Services\n\n(HHS)  for a  declaratory  judgment that  HHS had  wrongfully\n\nexcluded him from Medicare provider rolls in 1990.1  \n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  HHS excluded Friedman under 42 U.S.C.   1320a-7(b)(4)(A),\nwhich permits  exclusion of  an individual \"whose  license to\nprovide  health care  has been  revoked  or suspended  by any\nState  licensing authority . .  . for reasons  bearing on the\nindividual's  .  .  . professional  competence,  professional\nperformance,  or   financial  integrity.\"    HHS   based  its\nexclusion  on  New York's  revocation  of Friedman's  medical\nlicense.  New York had based its revocation on Massachusetts'\ndetermination that Friedman had engaged in \"gross misconduct\"\nsufficient   to  warrant  revocation  of  Friedman's  medical\nlicense in that state.  Friedman's period of exclusion was to\nend  when either  Massachusetts  or New  York reinstated  his\nlicense.\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          At Friedman's request, HHS reinstated Friedman as a\n\nMedicare  provider in November 1993.  When HHS later answered\n\nFriedman's   complaint,   it    asserted   that    Friedman's\n\nreinstatement had mooted  his claim for  relief and that  the\n\naction should be  dismissed.  The court  agreed and dismissed\n\nthe action sua sponte.2\r                                 \n\n          II.  Discussion\r                                     \n\n          We address two of Friedman's  arguments on appeal.3\n\nFirst, Friedman says that HHS is reasonably likely to exclude\n\nhim  again since  California revoked  his medical  license in\n\n1990  and that any future exclusion by HHS would likely evade\n\njudicial review because it would lapse before the court could\n\nrender  a  decision.     Second,  Friedman  argues  that  his\n\nexclusion  has continuing  collateral consequences  that will\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  Friedman  did not immediately appeal the order dismissing\nhis case, but filed  a motion for relief from  judgment under\nFed.  R.  Civ. P.  60(b), the  denial  of which  he appealed.\nBecause his motion was filed within the time limit for filing\nmotions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e),  however, and challenged\nthe legal correctness of the court's decision that his action\nwas moot,  we  treat it  as a  timely Rule  59(e) motion  and\nassume, without  deciding, that  the dismissal of  his action\nfor  mootness  is properly  before  us.   See  Perez-Perez v.\r                                                                      \nPopular Leasing Rental, Inc., 993 F.2d 281, 284-85  (1st Cir.\r                                        \n1993); Mariani-Giron v. Acevedo-Ruiz, 945 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\r                                                \n1991).\n\n3.  Other arguments  he makes  are without merit,  e.g., that\nthe stipulation of partial  dismissal and the court's failure\nto revoke  its stay  order prior to  Friedman's reinstatement\nwaived  mootness,  that  evidence discovered  in  1991 before\nFriedman filed his suit  qualified as new evidence justifying\nrelief  from  the court's  judgment,  and  that the  mootness\ndoctrine  does  not  apply   to  judicial  review  of  agency\ndecisions.\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\naffect his reputation and his medical and legal careers.  For\n\nthose   reasons,  Friedman  claims   that  his   request  for\n\ndeclaratory relief is not moot. \n\n          A.  Capable of Repetition Yet Evading Review\r                                                                  \n\n          We  conclude  that  the capable  of  repetition yet\n\nevading review exception to mootness does not apply.  While a\n\none-year exclusion  may well  evade judicial review,  it does\n\nnot seem at all  likely that HHS will exclude Friedman on the\n\nbasis of California's revocation of his medical license.\n\n          At the time Friedman applied for reinstatement, the\n\nCalifornia  revocation clearly  would have  been a  basis for\n\nexcluding Friedman from the Medicare  program.  See 42 U.S.C.\r                                                               \n\n   1320a-7(b)(4)(A),  supra  note  1.    Yet  HHS  reinstated\r                                       \n\nFriedman in 1993,  and so it must not have  believed that the\n\n1990  California  license  revocation  would be  grounds  for\n\nexcluding  Friedman.   See 42  C.F.R.    1001.3002(a)(3) (HHS\r                                      \n\n\"will\"  reinstate  an  excluded  individual  if,  among other\n\nthings,  it determines  that there  is \"no  additional basis\"\n\nunder the statute for continuing the  exclusion).4  Thus, the\n\nfact that  Friedman was  reinstated shows that  HHS would  be\n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  Friedman alleges that this regulation and others cited by\nHHS  in  its brief  were not  in effect  at  the time  he was\nexcluded,  but  does  not  allege  that  this  and  the other\nregulations embody practices  or policies that are  different\nfrom  ones prevailing  at  the time  of  his exclusion.    In\naddition,  we  note  that  the regulations  relating  to  the\nreinstatement  of excluded  individuals  became effective  on\nJanuary  29, 1992,  and so  presumably applied  to Friedman's\nreinstatement in November 1993.\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nunlikely to use the California revocation to exclude Friedman\n\nin the future.   Moreover, excluding Friedman because  of the\n\nCalifornia  revocation   would  arguably  be   an  abuse   of\n\ndiscretion.  California revoked Friedman's license because of\n\nMassachusetts' revocation of his license; that is, California\n\nbased its  license revocation on  the same misconduct  as had\n\nNew  York.   Because HHS  based Friedman's  exclusion  on New\n\nYork's  revocation  of  Friedman's  license,   excluding  him\n\nbecause  of  the   California  revocation  would  essentially\n\npenalize Friedman twice for the same  misconduct, a course of\n\naction that we doubt HHS would undertake.  \n\n          B. Collateral Consequences\r                                                \n\n          The  adverse  collateral   consequences  to   which\n\nFriedman  points do  not suffice  to avoid  mootness in  this\n\ncase.  According to Friedman, overturning his exclusion would\n\nrelieve him of the  stigma of having been excluded,  ease his\n\nadmission to  practice law in Massachusetts,  and relieve him\n\nof the  obligation to  explain the  exclusion  when he  seeks\n\nhospital  staff privileges,  affiliation with  certain health\n\ncare entities, or licensure in other states.  \n\n          Certainly, in some  situations, adverse  collateral\n\nconsequences such  as those advanced here have  been found to\n\navoid  mootness.   See, e.g.,  Kirkland v.  National Mortgage\r                                                                         \n\nNetwork,  Inc., 884  F.2d  1367, 1370  (11th Cir.  1989) (the\r                          \n\ndismissal  of an action did  not moot an attorney's challenge\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nto a court's  revocation of  his admission pro  hac vice  for\r                                                                    \n\nfailure   to  abide  by   promises  made   during  settlement\n\nnegotiations; the  \"brand of disqualification  on grounds  of\n\ndishonesty and  bad faith could well  hang over [plaintiff's]\n\nname  and  career  for  years to  come\");  Kleiner  v.

Washington  State Bar  Ass'n, 679  F.2d\r                                                              \n\n1313, 1316, 1318  (9th Cir.  1982) (an attorney  could sue  a\n\nstate bar association to expunge  a letter of admonition from\n\nhis file since he would be required to explain the admonition\n\nif  he applied  to the  bar in  other states or  for judicial\n\nappointments).  \n\n          Here, however,  it is  not the HHS  exclusion which\n\nhas tarnished Friedman's reputation, but the apparently valid\n\nNew York and Massachusetts  licensing board decisions,5 which\n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.  Friedman  apparently  did  not  challenge  the  New  York\ndecision in court.   The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\nhas upheld the Massachusetts decision.  See Friedman v. Board\r                                                                         \nof  Registration in  Medicine,  561 N.E.2d  859 (Mass.  1990)\r                                         \n(substantial  evidence  supported  the  decision   to  revoke\nFriedman's  license for gross  misconduct), cert. denied, 498\r                                                                    \nU.S.  1107  (1991);  Friedman  v. Board  of  Registration  in\r                                                                         \nMedicine, 609  N.E.2d 1223 (Mass. 1993)  (petition for relief\r                    \nfrom license revocation was denied).  \n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nconcluded  that  Friedman had  engaged in  gross professional\n\nmisconduct   sufficient   to   warrant  license   revocation.\n\nConsistent with the applicable statutory basis for exclusion,\n\nHHS's  letter notifying  Friedman of his  exclusion explained\n\nthat his exclusion  was based on \"the fact\" that New York had\n\nrevoked  his license  and  indicated that  the  issue in  any\n\nadministrative  hearing would  be \"whether  your license  was\n\nrevoked for reasons relating to your professional competence,\n\nprofessional  performance, or  financial  integrity.\"   Since\n\nFriedman's Medicare  exclusion was  based solely on  the fact\n\nthat his license had  been revoked, the exclusion effectively\n\nsignified only  that New York had  revoked Friedman's license\n\nfor  reasons  bearing  on   his  professional  competence  or\n\nperformance.  Compare 42 C.F.R.   1001.2007(a)(i) &amp; (ii) (the\r                                 \n\nonly issues before an ALJ in an exclusion hearing are whether\n\nthe  basis  for the  imposition  of the  sanction  exists and\n\nwhether  the   length  of  the   exclusion  is  reasonable).6\n\n                    \r                                \n\n6.  This regulation became effective January  29, 1992, after\nFriedman was  excluded.  Nonetheless,  it was published  as a\nproposed   regulation   before   Friedman's   exclusion   and\nrepresents  HHS's  interpretation   of  its  obligations   in\nexclusions such  as Friedman's  as of  the time  Friedman was\nexcluded.  See 55 Fed. Reg. 12,206  (4/2/90) (explaining that\r                          \nHHS's  authority  to exclude  certain  individuals, including\nthose  whose state  medical  licenses have  been revoked,  is\n\"derivative\" because \"our ability to exclude derives from the\nfact  that  another  entity has  imposed  a  sanction on  the\nindividual  or  health  care  entity.    [HHS]  would not  be\nrequired to reestablish  the factual or legal basis  for such\nunderlying sanction.\").  \n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nAlthough the exclusion resulted from  the license revocation,\n\nit conferred no additional stigma on Friedman.7  \n\n          Moreover, the  actual effect of  the exclusion  was\n\nexclusively a financial one, as the letter notifying Friedman\n\nof  his exclusion  made  clear.   Because  of his  exclusion,\n\nneither Medicare nor  certain federally-assisted state health\n\ncare programs  (from which Friedman was  also excluded) would\n\npay for services or  items furnished to Friedman's patients.8\n\n                    \r                                \n\n7.  HHS's letter  to Friedman notifying him  of his exclusion\ninformed him that HHS would notify certain state agencies and\nthe  public of his exclusion and  of the reasons therefor.  A\ncopy  of the  public  notice of  Friedman's exclusion  is not\nincluded in the  record, but it apparently would  have stated\nthat  Friedman's exclusion  would  end when  his license  was\nreinstated.  See 42 U.S.C.    1320a-7(c)(3)(A) (the notice of\r                            \nexclusion given to the excluded individual and  to the public\nshall  specify the minimum period of exclusion).  At the time\nFriedman was  reinstated, HHS  was required to  notify \"those\nagencies,  groups,   individuals,   and  others   that   were\noriginally   notified   of  the   exclusion\"   of  Friedman's\nreinstatement.  See 42 C.F.R.   1001.3003(a)(4).  Presumably,\r                               \ntherefore,  public  notice  of  Friedman's  reinstatement was\ngiven, although it is not clear whether the notice would have\ngiven  the  reason for  his  reinstatement.   Compare  id.   \r                                                                      \n1001.134(a)(2)  (a predecessor regulation  to   1001.3003(a),\nwhich  provided for  notice  to  the  public of  an  excluded\nindividual's  reinstatement).    Assuming that  the  original\npublic   notice  of  Friedman's   exclusion  had  stigmatized\nFriedman as a  person who  had lost his  medical license  for\nreasons   bearing   on   his  professional   performance   or\ncompetence,  that stigma likely would have been erased to the\nextent possible by the  reinstatement notice implying, if not\nstating outright, that he had regained his license.  \n\n8.  The letter stated:\n\n     The effect  of your exclusion from  participation in the\n     Medicare  and  State health  care  programs  is that  no\n     payment will  be made for  any items or  services (other\n     than an emergency item or service) furnished, ordered or\n     prescribed by you under the above-mentioned programs.\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nRegulations  in effect  at the  time Friedman  was reinstated\n\nindicate  that such payments  would have resumed  once he was\n\nreinstated.   See  42 C.F.R.    1001.1901(b)  (payments under\r                             \n\nMedicare and applicable state health care programs may not be\n\nmade unless  and until  an excluded individual  is reinstated\n\ninto the Medicare program);  id.   1001.3003(b) (with certain\r                                            \n\nexceptions apparently not applicable  here, state health care\n\nprograms must  reinstate an individual to  such programs upon\n\nnotification by  HHS that the individual  has been reinstated\n\nto  the Medicare program).   There is nothing  in the present\n\nrecord to suggest that reinstatement did not have this result\n\nin Friedman's case.\n\n          Thus,   if   Friedman  should   seek   some  future\n\naffiliation with a hospital or  other health care entity, the\n\ndecision to  grant  or  deny  him affiliation  would  not  be\n\naffected  by the  entity's inability  to receive  Medicare or\n\napplicable  state   program  payments  for   care  given   to\n\nFriedman's patients.  On the other hand, if hospitals, health\n\ncare entities, state medical  licensing boards, or any boards\n\nof bar examiners are  concerned about Friedman's character or\n\nprofessional competence or performance, their response to any\n\nfuture application of his would be affected predominantly, if\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     Furthermore, payment will  not be made to  any entity in\n     which you  are  serving as  an employee,  administrator,\n     operator, or in any other capacity for any services that\n     you  furnish,  order  or   prescribe  on  or  after  the\n     effective date of this exclusion.\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nnot  exclusively,  by the  apparently  valid  state decisions\n\nrevoking his medical license.  While   Friedman    may   have\n\nexpected  the  district  court  to  review  the Massachusetts\n\nlicense revocation  proceedings in this suit,  its review was\n\nof necessity  limited to the exclusion  decision itself which\n\ndid not encompass the state proceedings.  As noted above, the\n\nparties stipulated to dismissal  of Friedman's claims against\n\nall  defendants with the  exception of his  claim against HHS\n\nrelating   to  his  Medicare   exclusion.    Presumably,  the\n\njurisdictional  basis  for that  claim would  be 42  U.S.C.  \n\n1320a-7(f)(1),  which provides  for judicial review  of final\n\nHHS  exclusion  decisions.   Under  HHS  Departmental Appeals\n\nBoard  precedent   in  effect  at  the   time  of  Friedman's\n\nexclusion, excluded  individuals  could not  challenge  their\n\nexclusion  by  collaterally  attacking the  underlying  state\n\nlicense revocation proceedings.  Citing that  precedent, both\n\nthe  administrative law  judge  and the  Departmental Appeals\n\nBoard  rejected Friedman's attempt to collaterally attack the\n\nMassachusetts  and New  York license  revocation proceedings.\n\nThus, the  validity of  the underlying state  proceedings was\n\nnever  an issue  in  Friedman's exclusion  proceedings.   The\n\nscope of the  proceedings below having  been confined to  the\n\ndetermination  whether  the  statute  applied  to  Friedman,9\n\n                    \r                                \n\n9.  Friedman had  alleged that the statute  was being applied\nretroactively  to him  since  Massachusetts had  rendered its\nlicensing decision before the statute became effective.\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nwhether  Friedman's  license  had  been revoked  by  a  state\n\nlicensing  authority for the  statutorily prescribed reasons,\n\nand  whether  the period  of  exclusion  was reasonable,  the\n\ndistrict  court's review  of the decision  excluding Friedman\n\nwould be likewise constrained.

Leonard  Friedman  is  appealing the\r                                 \n\ndistrict  court's decision dismissing  his case for mootness.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n          I.  Background\r                                    \n\n          We  recite only  briefly the  pertinent facts.   In\n\n1991,  Friedman sued  various defendants,  claiming that  the\n\nrevocation of  his medical  license in Massachusetts  in 1987\n\nand  his exclusion from  Medicare provider rolls  in 1990 had\n\nbeen   unlawfully  effected.     The  district  court  stayed\n\nproceedings pending  the results  of other state  and federal\n\ncourt actions involving  the same parties.  In  October 1993,\n\nthe  court  approved  the  parties'  stipulation  of  partial\n\ndismissal.  Pursuant to  that stipulation, Friedman dismissed\n\nwith prejudice  his claims against all  defendants except his\n\nclaim  against the  Department of  Health and  Human Services\n\n(HHS)  for a  declaratory  judgment that  HHS had  wrongfully\n\nexcluded him from Medicare provider rolls in 1990.1  \n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  HHS excluded Friedman under 42 U.S.C.   1320a-7(b)(4)(A),\nwhich permits  exclusion of  an individual \"whose  license to\nprovide  health care  has been  revoked  or suspended  by any\nState  licensing authority . .  . for reasons  bearing on the\nindividual's  .  .  . professional  competence,  professional\nperformance,  or   financial  integrity.\"    HHS   based  its\nexclusion  on  New York's  revocation  of Friedman's  medical\nlicense.  New York had based its revocation on Massachusetts'\ndetermination that Friedman had engaged in \"gross misconduct\"\nsufficient   to  warrant  revocation  of  Friedman's  medical\nlicense in that state.  Friedman's period of exclusion was to\nend  when either  Massachusetts  or New  York reinstated  his\nlicense.\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          At Friedman's request, HHS reinstated Friedman as a\n\nMedicare  provider in November 1993.  When HHS later answered\n\nFriedman's   complaint,   it    asserted   that    Friedman's\n\nreinstatement had mooted  his claim for  relief and that  the\n\naction should be  dismissed.  The court  agreed and dismissed\n\nthe action sua sponte.2\r                                 \n\n          II.  Discussion\r                                     \n\n          We address two of Friedman's  arguments on appeal.3\n\nFirst, Friedman says that HHS is reasonably likely to exclude\n\nhim  again since  California revoked  his medical  license in\n\n1990  and that any future exclusion by HHS would likely evade\n\njudicial review because it would lapse before the court could\n\nrender  a  decision.     Second,  Friedman  argues  that  his\n\nexclusion  has continuing  collateral consequences  that will\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  Friedman  did not immediately appeal the order dismissing\nhis case, but filed  a motion for relief from  judgment under\nFed.  R.  Civ. P.  60(b), the  denial  of which  he appealed.\nBecause his motion was filed within the time limit for filing\nmotions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e),  however, and challenged\nthe legal correctness of the court's decision that his action\nwas moot,  we  treat it  as a  timely Rule  59(e) motion  and\nassume, without  deciding, that  the dismissal of  his action\nfor  mootness  is properly  before  us.   See  Perez-Perez v.\r                                                                      \nPopular Leasing Rental, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606663\"><a href=\"/opinion/606663/agustina-perez-perez-v-popular-leasing-rental-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 284-85  (1st Cir.\r                                        \n1993); Mariani-Giron v.

Other arguments  he makes  are without merit,  e.g., that\nthe stipulation of partial  dismissal and the court's failure\nto revoke  its stay  order prior to  Friedman's reinstatement\nwaived  mootness,  that  evidence discovered  in  1991 before\nFriedman filed his suit  qualified as new evidence justifying\nrelief  from  the court's  judgment,  and  that the  mootness\ndoctrine  does  not  apply   to  judicial  review  of  agency\ndecisions.\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\naffect his reputation and his medical and legal careers.  For\n\nthose   reasons,  Friedman  claims   that  his   request  for\n\ndeclaratory relief is not moot. \n\n          A.  Capable of Repetition Yet Evading Review\r                                                                  \n\n          We  conclude  that  the capable  of  repetition yet\n\nevading review exception to mootness does not apply.  While a\n\none-year exclusion  may well  evade judicial review,  it does\n\nnot seem at all  likely that HHS will exclude Friedman on the\n\nbasis of California's revocation of his medical license.\n\n          At the time Friedman applied for reinstatement, the\n\nCalifornia  revocation clearly  would have  been a  basis for\n\nexcluding Friedman from the Medicare  program.  See 42 U.S.C.\r                                                               \n\n   1320a-7(b)(4)(A),  supra  note  1.    Yet  HHS  reinstated\r                                       \n\nFriedman in 1993,  and so it must not have  believed that the\n\n1990  California  license  revocation  would be  grounds  for\n\nexcluding  Friedman.   See 42  C.F.R.    1001.3002(a)(3) (HHS\r                                      \n\n\"will\"  reinstate  an  excluded  individual  if,  among other\n\nthings,  it determines  that there  is \"no  additional basis\"\n\nunder the statute for continuing the  exclusion).4  Thus, the\n\nfact that  Friedman was  reinstated shows that  HHS would  be\n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  Friedman alleges that this regulation and others cited by\nHHS  in  its brief  were not  in effect  at  the time  he was\nexcluded,  but  does  not  allege  that  this  and  the other\nregulations embody practices  or policies that are  different\nfrom  ones prevailing  at  the time  of  his exclusion.    In\naddition,  we  note  that  the regulations  relating  to  the\nreinstatement  of excluded  individuals  became effective  on\nJanuary  29, 1992,  and so  presumably applied  to Friedman's\nreinstatement in November 1993.\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nunlikely to use the California revocation to exclude Friedman\n\nin the future.   Moreover, excluding Friedman because  of the\n\nCalifornia  revocation   would  arguably  be   an  abuse   of\n\ndiscretion.  California revoked Friedman's license because of\n\nMassachusetts' revocation of his license; that is, California\n\nbased its  license revocation on  the same misconduct  as had\n\nNew  York.   Because HHS  based Friedman's  exclusion  on New\n\nYork's  revocation  of  Friedman's  license,   excluding  him\n\nbecause  of  the   California  revocation  would  essentially\n\npenalize Friedman twice for the same  misconduct, a course of\n\naction that we doubt HHS would undertake.  \n\n          B. Collateral Consequences\r                                                \n\n          The  adverse  collateral   consequences  to   which\n\nFriedman  points do  not suffice  to avoid  mootness in  this\n\ncase.  According to Friedman, overturning his exclusion would\n\nrelieve him of the  stigma of having been excluded,  ease his\n\nadmission to  practice law in Massachusetts,  and relieve him\n\nof the  obligation to  explain the  exclusion  when he  seeks\n\nhospital  staff privileges,  affiliation with  certain health\n\ncare entities, or licensure in other states.  \n\n          Certainly, in some  situations, adverse  collateral\n\nconsequences such  as those advanced here have  been found to\n\navoid  mootness.

National Mortgage\r                                                                         \n\nNetwork,  Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"528915\"><a href=\"/opinion/528915/william-r-kirkland-and-all-other-persons-similarly-situated-v-national/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1370  (11th Cir.  1989) (the\r                          \n\ndismissal  of an action did  not moot an attorney's challenge\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nto a court's  revocation of  his admission pro  hac vice  for\r                                                                    \n\nfailure   to  abide  by   promises  made   during  settlement\n\nnegotiations; the  \"brand of disqualification  on grounds  of\n\ndishonesty and  bad faith could well  hang over [plaintiff's]\n\nname  and  career  for  years to  come\");  Kleiner  v.

Compare 42 C.F.R.   1001.2007(a)(i) &amp; (ii) (the\r                                 \n\nonly issues before an ALJ in an exclusion hearing are whether\n\nthe  basis  for the  imposition  of the  sanction  exists and\n\nwhether  the   length  of  the   exclusion  is  reasonable).6\n\n                    \r                                \n\n6.  This regulation became effective January  29, 1992, after\nFriedman was  excluded.  Nonetheless,  it was published  as a\nproposed   regulation   before   Friedman's   exclusion   and\nrepresents  HHS's  interpretation   of  its  obligations   in\nexclusions such  as Friedman's  as of  the time  Friedman was\nexcluded.  See 55 Fed. Reg. 12,206  (4/2/90) (explaining that\r                          \nHHS's  authority  to exclude  certain  individuals, including\nthose  whose state  medical  licenses have  been revoked,  is\n\"derivative\" because \"our ability to exclude derives from the\nfact  that  another  entity has  imposed  a  sanction on  the\nindividual  or  health  care  entity.    [HHS]  would not  be\nrequired to reestablish  the factual or legal basis  for such\nunderlying sanction.\").  \n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nAlthough the exclusion resulted from  the license revocation,\n\nit conferred no additional stigma on Friedman.7  \n\n          Moreover, the  actual effect of  the exclusion  was\n\nexclusively a financial one, as the letter notifying Friedman\n\nof  his exclusion  made  clear.   Because  of his  exclusion,\n\nneither Medicare nor  certain federally-assisted state health\n\ncare programs  (from which Friedman was  also excluded) would\n\npay for services or  items furnished to Friedman's patients.8\n\n                    \r                                \n\n7.  HHS's letter  to Friedman notifying him  of his exclusion\ninformed him that HHS would notify certain state agencies and\nthe  public of his exclusion and  of the reasons therefor.  A\ncopy  of the  public  notice of  Friedman's exclusion  is not\nincluded in the  record, but it apparently would  have stated\nthat  Friedman's exclusion  would  end when  his license  was\nreinstated.  See 42 U.S.C.    1320a-7(c)(3)(A) (the notice of\r                            \nexclusion given to the excluded individual and  to the public\nshall  specify the minimum period of exclusion).  At the time\nFriedman was  reinstated, HHS  was required to  notify \"those\nagencies,  groups,   individuals,   and  others   that   were\noriginally   notified   of  the   exclusion\"   of  Friedman's\nreinstatement.  See 42 C.F.R.   1001.3003(a)(4).  Presumably,\r                               \ntherefore,  public  notice  of  Friedman's  reinstatement was\ngiven, although it is not clear whether the notice would have\ngiven  the  reason for  his  reinstatement.   Compare  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>   \r                                                                      \n1001.134(a)(2)  (a </span><pre class=\"inline\">predecessor regulation  to   1001.3003(a),\nwhich  provided for  notice  to  the  public of  an  excluded\nindividual's  reinstatement).    Assuming that  the  original\npublic   notice  of  Friedman's   exclusion  had  stigmatized\nFriedman as a  person who  had lost his  medical license  for\nreasons   bearing   on   his  professional   performance   or\ncompetence,  that stigma likely would have been erased to the\nextent possible by the  reinstatement notice implying, if not\nstating outright, that he had regained his license.  \n\n8.  The letter stated:\n\n     The effect  of your exclusion from  participation in the\n     Medicare  and  State health  care  programs  is that  no\n     payment will  be made for  any items or  services (other\n     than an emergency item or service) furnished, ordered or\n     prescribed by you under the above-mentioned programs.\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nRegulations  in effect  at the  time Friedman  was reinstated\n\nindicate  that such payments  would have resumed  once he was\n\nreinstated.   See  42 C.F.R.    1001.1901(b)  (payments under\r                             \n\nMedicare and applicable state health care programs may not be\n\nmade unless  and until  an excluded individual  is reinstated\n\ninto the Medicare program);  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>   1001.3003(b) (with </span><pre class=\"inline\">certain\r                                            \n\nexceptions apparently not applicable  here, state health care\n\nprograms must  reinstate an individual to  such programs upon\n\nnotification by  HHS that the individual  has been reinstated\n\nto  the Medicare program).   There is nothing  in the present\n\nrecord to suggest that reinstatement did not have this result\n\nin Friedman's case.\n\n          Thus,   if   Friedman  should   seek   some  future\n\naffiliation with a hospital or  other health care entity, the\n\ndecision to  grant  or  deny  him affiliation  would  not  be\n\naffected  by the  entity's inability  to receive  Medicare or\n\napplicable  state   program  payments  for   care  given   to\n\nFriedman's patients.  On the other hand, if hospitals, health\n\ncare entities, state medical  licensing boards, or any boards\n\nof bar examiners are  concerned about Friedman's character or\n\nprofessional competence or performance, their response to any\n\nfuture application of his would be affected predominantly, if\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     Furthermore, payment will  not be made to  any entity in\n     which you  are  serving as  an employee,  administrator,\n     operator, or in any other capacity for any services that\n     you  furnish,  order  or   prescribe  on  or  after  the\n     effective date of this exclusion.\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nnot  exclusively,  by the  apparently  valid  state decisions\n\nrevoking his medical license.  While   Friedman    may   have\n\nexpected  the  district  court  to  review  the Massachusetts\n\nlicense revocation  proceedings in this suit,  its review was\n\nof necessity  limited to the exclusion  decision itself which\n\ndid not encompass the state proceedings.  As noted above, the\n\nparties stipulated to dismissal  of Friedman's claims against\n\nall  defendants with the  exception of his  claim against HHS\n\nrelating   to  his  Medicare   exclusion.    Presumably,  the\n\njurisdictional  basis  for that  claim would  be 42  U.S.C.  \n\n1320a-7(f)(1),  which provides  for judicial review  of final\n\nHHS  exclusion  decisions.   Under  HHS  Departmental Appeals\n\nBoard  precedent   in  effect  at  the   time  of  Friedman's\n\nexclusion, excluded  individuals  could not  challenge  their\n\nexclusion  by  collaterally  attacking the  underlying  state\n\nlicense revocation proceedings.  Citing that  precedent, both\n\nthe  administrative law  judge  and the  Departmental Appeals\n\nBoard  rejected Friedman's attempt to collaterally attack the\n\nMassachusetts  and New  York license  revocation proceedings.\n\nThus, the  validity of  the underlying state  proceedings was\n\nnever  an issue  in  Friedman's exclusion  proceedings.   The\n\nscope of the  proceedings below having  been confined to  the\n\ndetermination  whether  the  statute  applied  to  Friedman,9\n\n                    \r                                \n\n9.  Friedman had  alleged that the statute  was being applied\nretroactively  to him  since  Massachusetts had  rendered its\nlicensing decision before the statute became effective.\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nwhether  Friedman's  license  had  been revoked  by  a  state\n\nlicensing  authority for the  statutorily prescribed reasons,\n\nand  whether  the period  of  exclusion  was reasonable,  the\n\ndistrict  court's review  of the decision  excluding Friedman\n\nwould be likewise constrained.   Cf. Travers v. Sullivan, 801\r                                                                    \n\nF.  Supp. 395, 403 (E.D.
