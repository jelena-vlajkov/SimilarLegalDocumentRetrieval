He appeals, claiming\r\n\nthat his conviction  should be reversed under   United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Tavares, 21 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1994)(en banc), in which this\r                      \r\n\ncourt,  after Collins' trial, changed its rule concerning the\r\n\nadmissibility of the nature of the prior felony conviction in\r\n\nprosecutions under   922(g)(1).  Collins also argues that the\r\n\ncourt  abused  its  discretion in  admitting  as  an \"excited\r\n\nutterance\"  the statement  of his  intended  victim and  that\r\n\noverall   the  evidence   is  insufficient  to   support  his\r\n\nconviction.  His conviction is affirmed.\r\n\n          First, the  facts, as  they were  presented to  the\r\n\njury.   Renewing an old and unfriendly acquaintance, Collins,\r\n\nleaning  out  of  his  car  window,  got  into  an escalating\r\n\nargument with Harry Albizu in front of Albizu's parents' home\r\n\nin  Fitchburg on  April  29, 1992.  When Harry's  hefty older\r\n\nbrother  appeared  on  the front  steps,  Collins  drove off,\r\n\nyelling back to Harry, \"I'll be right back.   I'm gonna shoot\r\n\nyour fuckin' ass.\"  Apparently  believing Collins to be a man\r\n\nof  his word,  an upset  Harry  Albizu hailed  a police  car,\r\n\ncontaining  Fitchburg State College Police Officer Lord, told\r\n\nhim of  the threat, and   Officer Lord radioed  the Fitchburg\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nPolice for  help.  Albizu's  sister called the police  in the\r\n\nmeantime.\r\n\n          Sure enough, Collins returned  shortly, driving the\r\n\nCamaro  he  and his  wife  had  just  bought, and  this  time\r\n\nbringing two men with him.  Collins yelled for Albizu to come\r\n\nout and  out Albizu came,  but only  to the  porch.   Collins\r\n\ntried to entice Albizu down from the porch steps with various\r\n\ninsults  concerning Albizu's  relationship  with his  mother.\r\n\nAlbizu   tried  to  persuade   Collins  to  leave,   but  the\r\n\nweightlifting bar he threw at Collins missed.\r\n\n          Hearing police sirens approaching, Collins gestured\r\n\nto his two comrades.  They put a long stick-like object  that\r\n\nwas wrapped  up into the hatch of the  Camaro.  As the police\r\n\narrived, Collins, still yelling at Albizu, backpedaled toward\r\n\nhis car.\r\n\n           Police Officer Romano,  as he patted down  Collins\r\n\nat the  side of the  Camaro, saw shotgun  shells on  the back\r\n\nseat.  The hatch door to the car was ajar.  As Officer Romano\r\n\nlooked in, he saw a pump shotgun in a partially zippered case\r\n\nnext to two loose shotgun shells.  The gun was  fully loaded.\r\n\nA  fishing license  and  fishing  rods,  also in  the  hatch,\r\n\nbelonged to  Collins.   Officer Romano  asked Collins  if the\r\n\nshotgun  was his.  Collins replied  sarcastically, \"No.  It's\r\n\nyours.\"\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          Collins was placed  under arrest.  Hearing  that he\r\n\nwas  being arrested, an  agitated Collins pointed  at Albizu,\r\n\nand said  to  a police  officer  he  knew, \"Why  am  I  being\r\n\narrested?  They've got guns too.\"\r\n\n          Simultaneously,   Police   Officer    Raymond   was\r\n\ninterviewing  Albizu.  A  visibly upset Albizu  described the\r\n\ninitial argument he had had with Collins, and quoted Collins'\r\n\nstatement as described earlier. \r\n\n          The gun was owned  by Collins' father, who  kept it\r\n\nat his house, which was where Collins lived.\r\n\nThe Tavares Claim \r                              \r\n\n          The  prosecution   at  trial   introduced,  without\r\n\nobjection, Collins' prior felony conviction for  manslaughter\r\n\nand  referred several times to the manslaughter conviction in\r\n\nargument.  Collins' counsel did  not offer to stipulate  that\r\n\nCollins was  a felon  for purposes of    922(g)(1).   Indeed,\r\n\nunder  the law  of this  Circuit at  the  time of  trial, the\r\n\ngovernment  would not  have been  required  to accept  such a\r\n\nstipulation.  See United States v. Collamore, 868 F.2d 24, 28\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1989).  Several months after  Collins' trial, this\r\n\nCourt changed that rule in  United States v. Tavares, 21 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n1, 5.  Tavares \"revisited this issue and determined that when\r                          \r\n\na defendant is  charged with being a felon-in-possession of a\r\n\nfirearm,  evidence of the  nature of the  prior conviction is\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nnot  admissible unless  special circumstances  establish that\r\n\nthe  relevance of the evidence is 'sufficiently compelling to\r\n\nsurvive the  balancing test of  Fed. R. Evid. 403.'\"   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates   v.  Lewis,   40  F.3d   1325,   1342-43  (1st   Cir.\r                              \r\n\n1994)(quoting Tavares, 21 F.3d at 5).\r                                 \r\n\n               This Court  has twice  since applied  Tavares.\r                                                                        \r\n\nIn United  States v. Melvin, 27 F.3d 703 (1st Cir. 1994), the\r                                       \r\n\ncourt  applied  Tavares  retroactively to  cases  pending  on\r                                   \r\n\ndirect review where counsel had offered to stipulate.  Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n706-07 n.4.  In Melvin,  the court reversed, finding that the\r                                  \r\n\nadmission of  the convictions on  the facts was  not harmless\r\n\nerror.  Id.  at 709.  In United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325\r                                                           \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1994),  the court  applied  Tavares where  defense\r                                                          \r\n\ncounsel had  offered to stipulate,  but found that  any error\r\n\nwas harmless.  Id. at 1342-43.\r                              \r\n\n          Hoping to benefit from Tavares, Collins attempts to\r                                                    \r\n\nshoehorn his  arguments into  categories that  ill  fit.   He\r\n\nargues  that  he  suffered  from  ineffective  assistance  of\r\n\ncounsel because his  counsel neither objected to  nor offered\r\n\nto  stipulate  as to  the  manslaughter  conviction.1     But\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  This  Court   does  not  normally   consider  ineffective\r\nassistance of  counsel claims on  direct appeal.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\nUnited States v. Costa, 890 F.2d 480, 482-83 (1st Cir. 1989).\r                                  \r\nWhen  the record is sufficiently developed to allow analysis,\r\nhowever,  an appellate court may determine the merits of such\r\na contention on direct appeal.  See United States v. Natanel,\r                                                                        \r\n938 F.2d  302, 309  (1st Cir. 1991),  cert. denied,  502 U.S.\r                                                              \r\n1079 (1992).  This case falls within the exception. \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\ncounsel made no error in light of  the law at the time.   The\r\n\ntest  for an  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel  claim  as\r\n\narticulated in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984),\r                                                   \r\n\nis not  met. Collins  also argues that  the admission  of the\r\n\nconviction  was  barred  by  Fed.  R.  Evid.  403, as  unduly\r\n\nprejudicial.  Inasmuch  as there was no objection, the normal\r\n\nstandard of  review for such a claim would be for plain error\r\n\nunder Fed.  R. Crim. P.  52(b), as explicated by  the Supreme\r\n\nCourt in United States v. Olano, 113 S. Ct. 1770 (1993).\r                                           \r\n\n          Counsel, though,  can  hardly be  faulted  for  not\r\n\nobjecting or for  failing to stipulate, given the  law at the\r\n\ntime.   Considerations of fairness also raise questions about\r\n\nthe  appropriate  standard  of review  where  the  failure to\r\n\nobject  (or to stipulate) most likely  was based on counsel's\r\n\ncorrect understanding of the law at the time.\r\n\n          In United States v. Marder, 48 F.3d 564 (1st Cir.),\r                                                \r\n\ncert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 1441 (1995), this Court addressed an\r                        \r\n\nanalogous situation.   Without objection,  the district court\r\n\nhad  instructed on the  elements of the  government's case in\r\n\naccordance with  the law at  the time.  A  subsequent Supreme\r\n\nCourt decision made  clear that an additional  instruction on\r\n\nwillfulness was required, to the  effect that the jury had to\r\n\nfind  that the  defendant knew  the  currency structuring  in\r\n\nwhich he  was engaged  was unlawful.   Id.  at 572-73.   This\r                                                      \r\n\nCourt  then  faced  the issue  the  Olano  court specifically\r                                                     \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nreserved:  what happens \"where  the error was  unclear at the\r\n\ntime  of  trial  but  becomes clear  on  appeal  because  the\r\n\napplicable law  has been  clarified.\"    Id. at  573 (quoting\r                                                        \r\n\nOlano, 113 S. Ct at 1777). \r                 \r\n\n          The  Marder court applied plain error analysis.  It\r                                 \r\n\nis worth noting  that Marder had less sympathy with counsel's\r                                        \r\n\nfailure to object and for good reason.  At the time of trial,\r\n\nthis Circuit's law foreshadowed  the Supreme Court's decision\r\n\nand the precise issue had  caused withdrawal of an opinion by\r\n\nthis Court  and  reconsideration en  banc.   Counsel  was  on\r\n\nnotice. Id. at 572 n.5.  The Marder court avoided analysis of\r                                               \r\n\nissues that have divided other circuits on whether an \"error\"\r\n\noccasioned by a change in law was plain error and whether the\r\n\ndefendant's  substantial rights were affected2  by turning to\r\n\nthe last  prong of  the Olano  analysis: whether the  \"error\"\r                                         \r\n\n\"seriously   affects  the   fairness,  integrity   or  public\r\n\nreputation  of the  judicial  proceedings.\"    Id.    at  574\r                                                              \r\n\n(quoting  Olano, 113  S. Ct. at  1779)).  Marder  held that a\r                                                            \r\n\ndefective willfulness instruction  did not have any  of those\r\n\neffects,  disagreeing with the views of three other circuits.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The Second  Circuit has  held that  where  the court  has\r\nclarified the law, fairness requires that the burden on plain\r\nerror analysis be shifted to  the government to show that any\r                                                        \r\nerror  did  not affect  the  defendant's substantial  rights,\r\nvarying from  Olano's  rule that  in  the usual  plain  error\r                               \r\nanalysis the  burden  is  on the  defendant  to  show  actual\r                                                       \r\nprejudice.  See  United States v. Viola,  35 F.3d 37,  42 (2d\r                                                   \r\nCir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S.

Applying that analysis here, the admission of\r               \r\n\nthe  manslaughter conviction does not present even as serious\r\n\na challenge as  that posed in Marder, and  certainly does not\r                                                \r\n\nrise to the  level required by Olano.

If there was  any error\r\n\nhere, regardless  of who  has the  burden on  prejudice, such\r\n\nerror  was not  prejudicial.  The  district court  on several\r\n\noccasions gave limiting instructions  as to the  manslaughter\r\n\nconviction,   and  the   evidence  of   Collins'  guilt   was\r\n\noverwhelming, including evidence from his own mouth.     \r\n\nExcited Utterance\r                             \r\n\n          Collins  argues that  the  district court  erred in\r\n\nadmitting into evidence Albizu's statement to Officer Raymond\r\n\nthat Collins had said, \"I'll be right back.

The statement met\r                  \r\n\nthe three pronged test under  Fed. R.

While Albizu\r\n\nwas visibly upset and agitated, Albizu made his statement  to\r\n\nOfficer Raymond after Collins'  second visit, earlier  having\r\n\nmade  a similar  statement  to Officer  Lord.   The statement\r\n\nself-evidently  related to the events  at hand.  The question\r\n\nfor  the district  court was  whether a  jury could  find the\r\n\nconditional  fact upon which  the relevancy of  the statement\r\n\nturned  (i.e.,  whether  Albizu  made  the  statement)  by  a\r                         \r\n\npreponderance  of the evidence.

Officer Raymond wrote  Albizu's statement\r\n\ndown verbatim, Albizu separately made a substantially similar\r\n\nexcited utterance to  Officer Lord, and Collins did return to\r\n\nresume the argument with a loaded shotgun.\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nSufficiency of the Evidence\r                                       \r\n\n          Collins  argues   that  the   government  presented\r\n\ninsufficient evidence  to convict  him  of being  a felon  in\r\n\npossession of  a firearm because  he was a mere  passenger in\r\n\nthe car  in which the  firearm was  found.  This  argument is\r\n\nwithout merit.  \r\n\n          Our  inquiry is  whether  there  was evidence  from\r\n\nwhich a  rational trier of  fact could conclude  that Collins\r\n\nwas guilty beyond  a reasonable doubt.  See  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMoreno, 991 F.2d 943, 944  (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114\r                                                                    \r\n\nS.

Sec. 922(g)(1), Terry Lynn Collins received a sentence of more than 15 years (188 months) in prison.  He appeals, claiming that his conviction should be reversed under United States v. Tavares, 21 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1994) (en banc), in which this court, after Collins' trial, changed its rule concerning the admissibility of the nature of the prior felony conviction in prosecutions under Sec. 922(g)(1).  Collins also argues that the court abused its discretion in admitting as an \"excited utterance\" the statement of his intended victim and that overall the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction.  His conviction is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the facts, as they were presented to the jury.  Renewing an old and unfriendly acquaintance, Collins, leaning out of his car window, got into an escalating argument with Harry Albizu in front of Albizu's parents' home in Fitchburg on April 29, 1992.  When Harry's hefty older brother appeared on the front steps, Collins drove off, yelling back to Harry, \"I'll be right back.  I'm gonna shoot your fuckin' ass.\"   Apparently believing Collins to be a man of his word, an upset Harry Albizu hailed a police car, containing Fitchburg State College Police Officer Lord, told him of the threat, and Officer Lord radioed the Fitchburg police for help.  Albizu's sister called the police in the meantime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sure enough, Collins returned shortly, in the Camaro he and his wife had just bought, and this time bringing two men with him.  Collins yelled for Albizu to come out and out Albizu came, but only to the porch.  Collins tried to entice Albizu down from the porch steps with various insults concerning Albizu's relationship with his mother.  Albizu tried to persuade Collins to leave, but the weightlifting bar he threw at Collins missed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hearing police sirens approaching, Collins gestured to his two comrades.  They put a long stick-like object that was wrapped up into the hatch of the Camaro.  As the police arrived, Collins, still yelling at Albizu, backpedaled toward his car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Police Officer Romano, as he patted down Collins at the side of the Camaro, saw shotgun shells on the back seat.  The hatch door to the car was ajar.  As Officer Romano looked in, he saw a pump shotgun in a partially zippered case next to two loose shotgun shells.  The gun was fully loaded.  A fishing license and fishing rods, also in the hatch, belonged to Collins.  Officer Romano asked Collins if the shotgun was his.  Collins replied sarcastically, \"No.  It's yours.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collins was placed under arrest.  Hearing that he was being arrested, an agitated Collins pointed at Albizu, and said to a police officer he knew, \"Why am I being arrested?   They've got guns too.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simultaneously, Police Officer Raymond was interviewing Albizu.  A visibly upset Albizu described the initial argument he had had with Collins, and quoted Collins' statement as described earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gun was owned by Collins' father, who kept it at his house, which was where Collins lived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Tavares Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution at trial introduced, without objection, Collins' prior felony conviction for manslaughter and referred several times to the manslaughter conviction in argument.  Collins' counsel did not offer to stipulate that Collins was a felon for purposes of Sec. 922(g)(1).  Indeed, under the law of this Circuit at the time of trial, the government would not have been required to accept such a stipulation.  See United States v. Collamore, 868 F.2d 24, 28 (1st Cir.1989).  Several months after Collins' trial, this Court changed that rule in United States v. Tavares, 21 F.3d 1, 5.  Tavares \"revisited this issue and determined that when a defendant is charged with being a felon-in-possession of a firearm, evidence of the nature of the prior conviction is not admissible unless special circumstances establish that the relevance of the evidence is 'sufficiently compelling to survive the balancing test of Fed.R.Evid. 403.' \"  United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1342-43 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting Tavares, 21 F.3d at 5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court has twice since applied Tavares.   In United States v. Melvin, 27 F.3d 703 (1st Cir.1994), the court applied Tavares retroactively to cases pending on direct review where counsel had offered to stipulate.  Id. at 706-07 n. 4.   In Melvin, the court reversed, finding that the admission of the convictions on the facts was not harmless error.  Id. at 709.   In United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325 (1st Cir.1994), the court applied Tavares where defense counsel had offered to stipulate, but found that any error was harmless.  Id. at 1342-43.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoping to benefit from Tavares, Collins attempts to shoehorn his arguments into categories that ill fit.  He argues that he suffered from ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel neither objected to nor offered to stipulate as to the manslaughter conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  But counsel made no error in light of the law at the time.  The test for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as articulated in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), is not met.  Collins also argues that the admission of the conviction was barred by Fed.R.Evid. 403, as unduly prejudicial.  Inasmuch as there was no objection, the normal standard of review for such a claim would be for plain error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b), as explicated by the Supreme Court in United States v. Olano, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel, though, can hardly be faulted for not objecting or for failing to stipulate, given the law at the time.  Considerations of fairness also raise questions about the appropriate standard of review where the failure to object (or to stipulate) most likely was based on counsel's correct understanding of the law at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Marder, 48 F.3d 564 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1441, 131 L.Ed.2d 320 (1995), this Court addressed an analogous situation.  Without objection, the district court had instructed on the elements of the government's case in accordance with the law at the time.  A subsequent Supreme Court decision made clear that an additional instruction on willfulness was required, to the effect that the jury had to find that the defendant knew the currency structuring in which he was engaged was unlawful.  Id. at 572-73.   This Court then faced the issue the Olano court specifically reserved:  what happens \"where the error was unclear at the time of trial but becomes clear on appeal because the applicable law has been clarified.\"   Id. at 573 (quoting Olano, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1777).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Marder court applied plain error analysis.  It is worth noting that Marder had less sympathy with counsel's failure to object and for good reason.  At the time of trial, this Circuit's law foreshadowed the Supreme Court's decision and the precise issue had caused withdrawal of an opinion by this Court and reconsideration en banc.  Counsel was on notice.  Id. at 572 n. 5.   The Marder court avoided analysis of issues that have divided other circuits on whether an \"error\" occasioned by a change in law was plain error and whether the defendant's substantial rights were affected<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> by turning to the last prong of the Olano analysis:  whether the \"error\" \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\"  Id. at 574 (quoting Olano, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1779)).  Marder held that a defective willfulness instruction did not have any of those effects, disagreeing with the views of three other circuits.  Id. at 574-75.   Applying that analysis here, the admission of the manslaughter conviction does not present even as serious a challenge as that posed in Marder, and certainly does not rise to the level required by Olano.   See also United States v. Gaudin, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. 2310, ---- - ----, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995) (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring);  United States v. Whiting, 28 F.3d 1296, 1309 (1st Cir.), cert. denied --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 378, 130 L.Ed.2d 328 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we allow for the differences between the positions of counsel who failed to object in Marder and this case, it does not assist Collins.  If there was any error here, regardless of who has the burden on prejudice, such error was not prejudicial.  The district court on several occasions gave limiting instructions as to the manslaughter conviction, and the evidence of Collins' guilt was overwhelming, including evidence from his own mouth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Excited Utterance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collins argues that the district court erred in admitting into evidence Albizu's statement to Officer Raymond that Collins had said, \"I'll be right back.  I'm gonna shoot your fuckin' ass.\"   Collins argues that Albizu's testimony at trial--that the threat had been \"I'm going to come back and get your ass\"--did not confirm the statement.  The variance does not make the statement inadmissible, but only raises questions of credibility for the jury to decide.  See United States v. Portalla, 985 F.2d 621, 624 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's decision to admit evidence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.  United States v. Bailey, 834 F.2d 218, 228 (1st Cir.1987).  The statement met the three pronged test under Fed.R.Evid. 803(2), i.e., (i) the declarant experienced a startling event;  (ii) the statement was made while the declarant was subject to the influence of the event;  and (iii) the statement related to the event.  See id.   Albizu experienced the startling event of Collins threatening to return and shoot him.  While Albizu was visibly upset and agitated, Albizu made his statement to Officer Raymond after Collins' second visit, earlier having made a similar statement to Officer Lord.  The statement self-evidently related to the events at hand.  The question for the district court was whether a jury could find the conditional fact upon which the relevancy of the statement turned (i.e., whether Albizu made the statement) by a preponderance of the evidence.  Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 690, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 1501, 99 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988).  There were sufficient indicia of reliability as to Officer Raymond's report.  See Portalla, 985 F.2d at 624.   Officer Raymond wrote Albizu's statement down verbatim, Albizu separately made a substantially similar excited utterance to Officer Lord, and Collins did return to resume the argument with a loaded shotgun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collins argues that the government presented insufficient evidence to convict him of being a felon in possession of a firearm because he was a mere passenger in the car in which the firearm was found.

See United States v. Moreno, 991 F.2d 943, 944 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 457, 126 L.Ed.2d 389 (1994).

When the record is sufficiently developed to allow analysis, however, an appellate court may determine the merits of such a contention on direct appeal.  See United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1079, 112 S.Ct. 986, 117 L.Ed.2d 148 (1992).

Sec. 922(g)(1), Terry Lynn Collins received a sentence of more than 15 years (188 months) in prison.  He appeals, claiming that his conviction should be reversed under United States v. Tavares, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195307\"><a href=\"/opinion/195307/united-states-v-tavares/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1994) (en banc), in which this court, after Collins' trial, changed its rule concerning the admissibility of the nature of the prior felony conviction in prosecutions under Sec. 922(g)(1).  Collins also argues that the court abused its discretion in admitting as an \"excited utterance\" the statement of his intended victim and that overall the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction.  His conviction is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the facts, as they were presented to the jury.  Renewing an old and unfriendly acquaintance, Collins, leaning out of his car window, got into an escalating argument with Harry Albizu in front of Albizu's parents' home in Fitchburg on April 29, 1992.  When Harry's hefty older brother appeared on the front steps, Collins drove off, yelling back to Harry, \"I'll be right back.  I'm gonna shoot your fuckin' ass.\"   Apparently believing Collins to be a man of his word, an upset Harry Albizu hailed a police car, containing Fitchburg State College Police Officer Lord, told him of the threat, and Officer Lord radioed the Fitchburg police for help.  Albizu's sister called the police in the meantime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sure enough, Collins returned shortly, in the Camaro he and his wife had just bought, and this time bringing two men with him.  Collins yelled for Albizu to come out and out Albizu came, but only to the porch.  Collins tried to entice Albizu down from the porch steps with various insults concerning Albizu's relationship with his mother.  Albizu tried to persuade Collins to leave, but the weightlifting bar he threw at Collins missed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hearing police sirens approaching, Collins gestured to his two comrades.  They put a long stick-like object that was wrapped up into the hatch of the Camaro.  As the police arrived, Collins, still yelling at Albizu, backpedaled toward his car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Police Officer Romano, as he patted down Collins at the side of the Camaro, saw shotgun shells on the back seat.  The hatch door to the car was ajar.  As Officer Romano looked in, he saw a pump shotgun in a partially zippered case next to two loose shotgun shells.  The gun was fully loaded.  A fishing license and fishing rods, also in the hatch, belonged to Collins.  Officer Romano asked Collins if the shotgun was his.  Collins replied sarcastically, \"No.  It's yours.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collins was placed under arrest.  Hearing that he was being arrested, an agitated Collins pointed at Albizu, and said to a police officer he knew, \"Why am I being arrested?   They've got guns too.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simultaneously, Police Officer Raymond was interviewing Albizu.  A visibly upset Albizu described the initial argument he had had with Collins, and quoted Collins' statement as described earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gun was owned by Collins' father, who kept it at his house, which was where Collins lived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Tavares Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution at trial introduced, without objection, Collins' prior felony conviction for manslaughter and referred several times to the manslaughter conviction in argument.  Collins' counsel did not offer to stipulate that Collins was a felon for purposes of Sec. 922(g)(1).  Indeed, under the law of this Circuit at the time of trial, the government would not have been required to accept such a stipulation.  See United States v. Collamore, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518739\"><a href=\"/opinion/518739/united-states-v-wayne-n-collamore-in-re-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.1989).  Several months after Collins' trial, this Court changed that rule in United States v.

Tavares \"revisited this issue and determined that when a defendant is charged with being a felon-in-possession of a firearm, evidence of the nature of the prior conviction is not admissible unless special circumstances establish that the relevance of the evidence is 'sufficiently compelling to survive the balancing test of Fed.R.Evid. 403.' \"  United States v.

He argues that he suffered from ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel neither objected to nor offered to stipulate as to the manslaughter conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  But counsel made no error in light of the law at the time.

Inasmuch as there was no objection, the normal standard of review for such a claim would be for plain error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b), as explicated by the Supreme Court in United States v. Olano, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Without objection, the district court had instructed on the elements of the government's case in accordance with the law at the time.

It is worth noting that Marder had less sympathy with counsel's failure to object and for good reason.  At the time of trial, this Circuit's law foreshadowed the Supreme Court's decision and the precise issue had caused withdrawal of an opinion by this Court and reconsideration en banc.  Counsel was on notice.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 572 </a></span>n. 5.   The Marder court avoided analysis of issues that have divided other circuits on whether an \"error\" occasioned by a change in law was plain error and whether the defendant's substantial rights were affected<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> by turning to the last prong of the Olano analysis:  whether the \"error\" \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 574 </a></span>(quoting Olano, --- U.S. at <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">----,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Marder held that a defective willfulness instruction did not have any of those effects, disagreeing with the views of three other circuits.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 574</a></span>-75.

If there was any error here, regardless of who has the burden on prejudice, such error was not prejudicial.

The variance does not make the statement inadmissible, but only raises questions of credibility for the jury to decide.  See United States v.

The statement met the three pronged test under Fed.R.Evid. 803(2), i.e., (i) the declarant experienced a startling event;  (ii) the statement was made while the declarant was subject to the influence of the event;  and (iii) the statement related to the event.

While Albizu was visibly upset and agitated, Albizu made his statement to Officer Raymond after Collins' second visit, earlier having made a similar statement to Officer Lord.  The statement self-evidently related to the events at hand.  The question for the district court was whether a jury could find the conditional fact upon which the relevancy of the statement turned (i.e., whether Albizu made the statement) by a preponderance of the evidence.
