We\n\naffirm.\n\nI.   Claims Against the City.\n                            \n\n          Federal courts must  accord a state court  judgment the\n\nsame preclusive effect it would receive in the state where it was\n\nrendered.   Allen v.  McCurry, 449 U.S.  90, 96  (1980) (  1983).\n                             \n\n                    \n\n     1The  Rhode Island Supreme  Court likewise  upheld plaintiff\nCunningham's termination.  DiPinto did not appeal.\n\n                                2\n\nUnder the  Rhode Island doctrine  of res judicata  (claim preclu-\n\nsion), a final judgment on the merits precludes  later litigation\n\nof the same  claim by the  same parties.   Coates v. Coleman,  51\n                                                            \n\nA.2d 81, 85  (R.I. 1947).  See  Capraro v.

A dismissal, with\n\nprejudice, constitutes a  final judgment on  the merits.   School\n                                                                 \n\nComm.  of  North  Providence v.

As the City was a party\n        \n\nto the state court actions,  we need only consider whether appel-\n\nlants  had a  full and  fair opportunity  in the  state court  to\n\nlitigate against  the  City  all  issues raised  in  the  present\n\naction.  Kremer  v. Chemical Constr. Corp., 456  U.S. 461, 480-81\n                                          \n\n(1982).   Appellants do  not deny that  they had a  full and fair\n\nopportunity to  litigate their claims  against the City  in state\n\ncourt;  indeed, they admittedly chose, for strategic reasons, not\n                                     \n\nto  raise \"the current . . . issues.\"  Consequently, their claims\n\nagainst the City are res judicata.2\n\n                    \n\n     2Appellants  now assert that  the City violated  their civil\nrights after  the state  court judgments were  entered.   As this\n            \nclaim was not presented below, we decline to consider it.  Nieves\n                                                                 \nv.

Claims Against the Union.\n                             \n\n          A claim for breach of  a Union's duty of fair represen-\n\ntation  cannot succeed  absent a  showing, inter  alia,  that the\n                                                      \n\nunderlying action  against the  employer was  meritorious.   Kis-\n                                                                 \n\nsinger v. U.S. Postal Service, 801 F.2d 551, 553 (1st Cir. 1986).\n                             \n\nCf. Hines v.  Anchor Motor Freight, 424 U.S.  554, 570-71 (1976).\n                                  \n\nHere, the Union  duly interposed its collateral  estoppel defense\n\n(issue  preclusion) in response to appellants' present attempt to\n\nrelitigate the merits of their unsuccessful claims to a  termina-\n\ntion hearing.  Mutuality of parties is not essential to a collat-\n\neral estoppel defense under Rhode Island law.   Providence Teach-\n                                                                 \n\ners  Union, etc.  v. McGovern,  319  A.2d 358,  361 (R.I.  1974).\n                             \n\nSince appellants are collaterally estopped from relitigating  the\n\nmerits of their  underlying claims against the City     an essen-\n\ntial  element of their  unfair representation claims  against the\n\nUnion    the district court correctly entered summary judgment in\n\nfavor of the Union.  See  Goldman v. First Nat'l Bank of  Boston,\n                                                                \n\n985 F.2d 1113, 1116 (1st Cir. 1993).3\n\n          The  district court judgments in favor of the appellees\n\nmust be affirmed.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n     3Insofar as their complaint may attempt to plead  claims not\ndependent on precluded grounds, appellants failed to come forward\nwith specific evidence, or  authority, sufficient to  demonstrate\nthat the Union  is not entitled to  judgment as a matter  of law.\nId.\n   \n\n                                4\n",
