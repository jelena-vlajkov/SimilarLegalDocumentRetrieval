Ct. 947 (1995).\r                                       \r\n\n          On May 14, 1994, Gary and a friend, Eric Hopkins, spent\r\n\npart  of  the  evening  going to  nightclubs.    After  midnight,\r\n\nPatrolman  James  Joseph Corry  of  the  North Providence  Police\r\n\nDepartment encountered Gary and Hopkins when they were attempting\r\n\nto break into  Rhode Island  Auto Radio.   Earlier that  evening,\r\n\nthey  had stolen some vases  from a furniture  store elsewhere in\r\n\nNorth  Providence.  Upon seeing  Corry, Hopkins fled  on foot and\r\n\nGary attempted to escape by car at high speed.  Gary lost control\r\n\nof the vehicle, which left the  road and struck the foundation of\r\n\nan adjacent  building.    Corry  caught up  to  Gary  as  he  was\r\n\nattempting to exit the wrecked automobile.  Gary resisted arrest,\r\n\nand the efforts of several officers were necessary to subdue him.\r\n\nOnce the officers successfully apprehended Gary, they conducted a\r\n\n\"pat-down\" search for weapons.  At that time, a loaded and fully-\r\n\noperable  Colt .25  caliber handgun  fell from  Gary's waistband.\r\n\nHopkins  also  was   arrested, and  a  Dickson .25  caliber semi-\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Gary also contends he did not receive a fair trial in light of\r\nthe  totality and cumulative effect of  the trial court's errors.\r\nSince we do not find error with  respect to any of the issues, we\r\ndo not address this claim separately.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nautomatic  pistol was seized from him.  Hopkins later admitted to\r\n\npossessing the firearm.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          B.  PROCEEDINGS BELOW\r                    B.  PROCEEDINGS BELOW\r\n\n          Gary and  Hopkins each were initially  charged in state\r\n\ncourt  with violations  of the  Rhode Island  General Laws.2   On\r\n\nJune 9,  1994,  a  federal  grand  jury  returned  an  indictment\r\n\ncharging  both with  possession  of  a  firearm  by  a  felon  in\r\n\nviolation  of 18  U.S.C.    922(g).    On  August 31,  1994,  the\r\n\ngovernment filed a notice  that, if Gary was convicted,  it would\r\n\nseek  a penalty enhancement pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal\r\n\nAct (\"ACCA\"),  18 U.S.C.    924(e)(1).   Hopkins pled  guilty, on\r\n\nSeptember 8, 1994.\r\n\n          From October 13 to  17, 1994, Gary was tried by  a jury\r\n\nbefore Judge Raymond J. Pettine.  Hopkins, who was represented by\r\n\ncounsel, testified on Gary's behalf and was cross-examined by the\r\n\ngovernment  concerning the  break-ins, the  circumstances  of the\r\n\narrest,  and the firearms.   The proceedings ended  in a mistrial\r\n\nwhen the jury announced that it was unable to reach a verdict.\r\n\n          Gary's case then was transferred to Judge Mary M. Lisi,\r\n\nbefore  whom the second jury trial commenced on October 25, 1994.\r\n\nWhen  Gary attempted to call  Hopkins to the  stand, however, the\r\n\ngovernment objected on the grounds  that Hopkins would invoke his\r\n\nFifth  Amendment right  against self-incrimination  during cross-\r\n\nexamination.  At  a conference and  subsequent voir dire  outside\r\n\nthe presence  of  the jury,  Gary  proffered that  Hopkins  would\r\n\ntestify that, while they were together at nightclubs on the night\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  Gary  was charged with  possession of a firearm,  breaking and\r\nentering,  conspiracy,  assault  with  a  dangerous  weapon,  and\r\nreckless driving.  \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nof  May 14, 1994, he  never saw Gary  possess a firearm  and that\r\n\nthey were together until  approximately ten minutes preceding the\r\n\nautomobile  wreck after  which Gary  was arrested.   In  the voir\r\n\ndire, Hopkins asserted  his privilege against  self-incrimination\r\n\nin response to questioning about the breaking and entering, which\r\n\nimmediately preceded his arrest.  Hopkins was then facing pending\r\n\nstate  breaking  and entering  charges  and  a parole  revocation\r\n\nproceeding and had not yet been sentenced on the federal charge.\r\n\n          Although  Hopkins  had  testified in  the  first  trial\r\n\nregarding the  breaking and  entering  and had  been assisted  by\r\n\ncounsel at that time, the court held that his prior testimony was\r\n\nnot a  voluntary, knowing, and  intelligent waiver  of his  Fifth\r\n\nAmendment  privilege,  particularly  because   Hopkins'  separate\r\n\ncounsel for  the  state proceedings  had not  been informed  that\r\n\nHopkins would  be appearing  in federal  court.3   Moreover,  the\r\n\ncourt  held  that  the  government's  intended  cross-examination\r\n\nregarding   the   breaking  and   entering   was   \"germane\"  and\r\n\n\"permissible\" and thus refused to restrict its scope.\r\n\n          After  excusing  Hopkins  from  testifying,  the  court\r\n\npermitted Gary  to introduce  Hopkins'  prior recorded  testimony\r\n\nfrom the  first trial by having  it read to the  jury by Hopkins'\r\n\nstate counsel.  Notwithstanding this ruling, Gary argued that his\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3   Hopkins was represented  by three different  attorneys in the\r\nvarious  federal and  state  proceedings who  apparently did  not\r\ncommunicate in advance of Hopkins'  testimony in the first trial.\r\nIn addition,  when Gary's counsel interviewed  Hopkins to solicit\r\ninformation  upon which  his  testimony in  the  first trial  was\r\nbased,  she asked  permission only  of the  attorney representing\r\nHopkins on the federal charges.  \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nSixth  Amendment right  to  compulsory process  was violated  and\r\n\nmoved for a mistrial on that ground.  This motion was denied.\r\n\n          The jury  returned a verdict  of guilty on  October 28,\r\n\n1995.   Gary was sentenced as an armed career criminal to twenty-\r\n\nfour years and two months imprisonment, five  years of supervised\r\n\nrelease, and a $50  special assessment.  Judgment was  entered on\r\n\nJanuary 19, 1995, and Gary filed a timely notice of appeal.  \r\n\n                          II.  ANALYSIS\r                                    II.  ANALYSIS\r                                                 \r\n\n          A.  Sixth Amendment Compulsory Process\r                    A.  Sixth Amendment Compulsory Process\r\n\n          This case requires us to harmonize a conflict between a\r\n\ndefendant's Sixth Amendment right \"to have compulsory process for\r\n\nobtaining witnesses in his favor,\" U.S. Const. amend. VI, and the\r\n\ngovernment's  interest in  cross-examining a defense  witness who\r\n\nhas invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\r\n\n          Gary contends that his  right to compulsory process was\r\n\ndenied  when the trial court refused to permit Hopkins to testify\r\n\nand  instead only  permitted  Hopkins' testimony  from the  first\r\n\ntrial to be read to  the jury.  Gary argues that the  trial court\r\n\nshould have  required Hopkins to  invoke his right  against self-\r\n\nincrimination during cross-examination in the jury's presence. \r\n\n          \"The right to  offer the testimony of witnesses, and to\r\n\ncompel their  attendance,  if necessary,  is in  plain terms  the\r\n\nright to present a defense  . . . .  This right  is a fundamental\r\n\nelement  of due process  of law.\"  Washington  v. Texas, 388 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n14,  19 (1967); see also  Chambers v. Mississippi,  410 U.S. 284,\r                                                           \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n302 (1973).  The  Sixth Amendment, however, does not  provide \"an\r\n\nunfettered  right   to  offer  testimony  that   is  incompetent,\r\n\nprivileged,  or  otherwise inadmissible  under standard  rules of\r\n\nevidence.\"  Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 400, 410 (1988).  As the\r                                        \r\n\nSupreme Court  noted  in an  opinion  upholding a  trial  judge's\r\n\ndecision to preclude a defense witness's testimony on evidentiary\r\n\ngrounds,  \"[t]he  Sixth Amendment  does not  confer the  right to\r\n\npresent  testimony  free  from  the  legitimate  demands  of  the\r\n\nadversary  system; one  cannot invoke  the Sixth  Amendment as  a\r\n\njustification for presenting what  might have been a half-truth.\"\r\n\nUnited States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 241 (1975).\r                                 \r\n\n          While  the  government's  interest  in  cross-examining\r\n\ndefense  witnesses is not rooted  in the Constitution, see United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v.

The trial  court held  a\r\n\nvoir  dire  hearing  to  determine  whether  the  subject  matter\r\n\nconcerning  which  the  witness  intended  to  assert  the  Fifth\r\n\nAmendment  was collateral.

See Berr o-Londo o, 946\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  at  160  (holding  that  trial  court  did  not  abuse  its\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\ndiscretion by  refusing to  strike witness's testimony  on direct\r\n\nexamination when  witness asserted Fifth Amendment  on collateral\r\n\nmatters  on  cross-examination,  particularly  when  witness  was\r\n\nrequired  to invoke privilege in presence of jury).  We apply the\r\n\nsame  abuse   of  discretion  standard   in  determining  kindred\r\n\nchallenges  under  the Compulsory  Process  Clause  of the  Sixth\r\n\nAmendment.   See United States v.  Blum, 62 F.3d 63,  67 (2d Cir.\r                                                 \r\n\n1995)   (applying  abuse   of  discretion   standard  to   review\r\n\nevidentiary  decision  challenged  on Compulsory  Process  Clause\r\n\nground).  We find no abuse of discretion here.\r\n\n          According  to  Gary's  proffer,  \"Hopkins   would  have\r\n\ntestified that during  the course of the evening,  he was able to\r\n\nobserve  [Gary] and never visually  saw a firearm  on his person,\r\n\nnor  was one detected  by the metal detectors,  or doorman at the\r\n\nnightclubs.\"   Hopkins' testimony  certainly was material  to the\r\n\ndefense  as  it  showed  that,  after  a  significant  period  of\r\n\nobservation, he did not see Gary possess a firearm.   However, at\r\n\nthe  first  trial,  Hopkins  testified that  the  pair  had  been\r\n\ninvolved in two instances of breaking and entering after  leaving\r\n\nthe clubs and that he did not know whether Gary had hidden  a gun\r\n\nin his car before going to the clubs.  Had Hopkins been permitted\r\n\nto testify  and  to  refuse to  answer  questions  regarding  the\r\n\nbreaking  and  entering,  as he  told  the  court  he would,  the\r\n\ngovernment's  cross-examination   of  Hopkins  would   have  been\r\n\nrendered ineffective.  \r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\n          Thus  the trial  court found,  \"[t]he matters  that Mr.\r\n\nHopkins  would have testified to and, in  fact, did testify to at\r\n\nthe previous trial were closely related in time  and space to the\r\n\nmatter  that is before the Court in which the jury must consider.\r\n\nAnd  therefore,  all  of  the information  that  would  have been\r\n\nelicited  or attempted  to have  been elicited by  the Government\r\n\nwould have been  germane and  would have been  permissible.\"   We\r\n\ndiscern no abuse of discretion in the trial court's determination\r\n\nthat  the subject  matter of  the cross-examination  as to  which\r\n\nHopkins  would  have  asserted  his privilege  was  material  and\r\n\nrelevant.   Any limitation  on cross-examination would  have been\r\n\nunduly prejudicial to the government.\r\n\n          Furthermore, in striking  the appropriate balance,  the\r\n\ntrial court took into consideration that Gary was not deprived of\r\n\nan opportunity  to present Hopkins' testimony.   Although Hopkins\r\n\ndid not appear personally in the second trial, his testimony from\r\n\nthe first trial was read  in full to the jury.  It  was read with\r\n\ncounsel  for  the government  and  for  Gary each  reading  their\r\n\nrespective parts  and a third person  reading Hopkins' responses.\r\n\nIndeed,  at  oral argument  Gary's  counsel  engaged in  a  brief\r\n\nthespian demonstration intended to  convey the desiccated  manner\r\n\nin which Hopkins' testimony was read at  Gary's second trial.  We\r\n\nnoted  then,  and  reiterate   today,  that  whenever  transcript\r\n\ntestimony  is admitted in a trial, the fact-finder is deprived of\r\n\na full-fledged opportunity to assess directly the credibility and\r\n\ndemeanor of  the  declarant.   The  rules of  evidence,  however,\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\npermit such evidence to be admitted at trial.  See  Fed. R. Evid.\r                                                            \r\n\n804(b)(1) (former testimony exception to hearsay rule).\r\n\n          Gary suggests that, rather than  prohibit Hopkins' live\r\n\ntestimony  altogether,  the  trial  court  should have  permitted\r\n\nHopkins to testify on direct examination and forced him to invoke\r\n\nthe   Fifth  Amendment  privilege  on  cross-examination  in  the\r\n\npresence of the jury.  That solution, Gary argues, strikes a more\r\n\nappropriate balance between the  government's and the defendant's\r\n\ninterests because \"the government  could have used the transcript\r\n\nto impeach this testimony  or could have relied upon  the adverse\r\n\ninference  of  the witness's  invocation  of  the Fifth.\"    This\r\n\napproach  finds some support in United States v. Kaplan, 832 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n676 (1st Cir. 1987),  cert. denied, 485 U.S. 907 (1988), where we\r                                            \r\n\nheld that when \"a non-party government witness  invokes the Fifth\r\n\nAmendment on cross-examination at  trial, the court should permit\r\n\nthe assertion of the privilege in the presence of the  jury.  The\r\n\ninvocation of the privilege acts as a form of  impeachment.\"  Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 684.  \r\n\n          In Kaplan,  we distinguished United  States v.

Id. at 1211.  The basis for\r                                                   \r\n\nthe distinction follows:\r\n\n            A  different case is  presented where, as\r\n            here, the defense seeks  to cross-examine\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n            a  government witness within the scope of\r\n            his direct  and then the  witness asserts\r\n            the privilege.  We  note, first, that the\r\n            impact on the  jury's deliberations  from\r\n            asserting  the privilege  has to  be less\r\n            here than in Johnson  from the fact  that\r                                          \r\n            Brown   did   not  claim   the  privilege\r\n            comprehensively.  Instead, Brown answered\r\n            most questions put to him by the  defense\r\n            and could have refused to answer at trial\r\n            only those bearing on the alleged cocaine\r\n            abuse.   And whatever  danger exists that\r\n            the jury may give too much weight to this\r\n            line   of   questioning   is   small   in\r\n            comparison to its impeachment value.\r\n\nKaplan, 832 F.2d at 684.\r                \r\n\n          Unlike  Kaplan,  where  the  invocation  of  the  Fifth\r                                  \r\n\nAmendment  pertained to  a  collateral matter  --  the effect  of\r\n\nalleged  cocaine  abuse  on  the  witness's  power  of memory  or\r\n\nobservation --  here the  assertion of  the privilege would  have\r\n\nshielded the witness from testifying on a core issue addressed on\r\n\ndirect  examination.   Hopkins'  claim  of  privilege would  have\r\n\nprecluded government inquiry into  the intervening events between\r\n\nthe  time Hopkins observed the  defendant to have  no firearm and\r\n\nthe time the police officer testified he saw a gun in defendant's\r\n\npossession.  Such testimony would have been directly relevant  to\r\n\nGary's guilt  or innocence.   Accordingly, while the  trial judge\r\n\nmay have had the discretion to  strike a balance along the  lines\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nproposed by the defendant,4  there was no abuse of  discretion in\r\n\nstriking the balance a different way.5\r\n\n          B.

Therefore, he contends, the\r\n\ntrial court wrongly sustained Hopkins' claim of privilege  in the\r\n\nsecond trial.\r\n\n          The  Fifth Amendment  privilege is \"fundamental  to our\r\n\nsystem  of constitutional  rule.\"   Miranda v.

Specifically, he contends that  Officer John Arzoomanian\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7    These so-called  statistics,  compiled  by  hand by  defense\r\ncounsel based  on \"information and belief,\"  are comprised solely\r\nof a list of prosecutions brought in the District of Rhode Island\r\nunder 18 U.S.C.    922 and 924 from 1990-1994 purporting to  show\r\nthat 70% of those prosecuted were members of a minority racial or\r\nethnic group.   The statistics  do not address  whether similarly\r\nsituated  whites  were  not  prosecuted.   Given  the  procedural\r\nposture  of this case, we need not resolve the difficult question\r\nas  to   when  raw  data  demonstrate   a  statistical  disparity\r\nsufficient  to trigger the need for a hearing.  See Pe agar cano-\r                                                                           \r\nSoler, 911 F.2d at 837-38. \r               \r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nof the  North Providence  Police Department committed  perjury at\r\n\nthe first trial when  testifying as to why he did not fingerprint\r\n\nthe firearm that was seized from Gary.  In Gary's first trial, in\r\n\nresponse  to a question on re-direct examination as to why he did\r\n\nnot attempt to recover fingerprints, he answered:  \"As far as the\r\n\nsize of  the gun --  the surface of  the weapon, also  the people\r\n\ninvolved in the case both had gloves on.\"  (emphasis  added).  On\r                                                 \r\n\nre-cross, Arzoomanian hedged:\r\n\n            Q.  And you  didn't bother to  attempt to\r\n                lift a  print  in this  case  because\r\n                this man had gloves on;  is that your\r\n                testimony?\r\n\n            A.  Well,  there were gloves found at the\r\n                scene and gloves found in the vehicle\r\n                also.\r\n\nAt the  second trial,  however, Arzoomanian testified  that after\r\n\nthe  arrest,  but before  the first  trial,  he learned  that the\r\n\ngloves  actually belonged  to  rescue personnel.   He  explained:\r\n\n\"You asked  the reason  why I  didn't print the  weapon.   I said\r\n\nbecause he had gloves on.   And I found out later, he didn't.  At\r\n\nthat point, the  evidence was  handled by too  many people.\"   As\r\n\nGary's   counsel   ably   emphasized  during   cross-examination,\r\n\nArzoomanian's testimony in the two  proceedings was inconsistent.\r\n\nGary asserts that Arzoomanian therefore committed perjury.\r\n\n          Arzoomanian's testimony in the second trial did  differ\r\n\nin  a troubling  way from  that given  in the  first trial.   His\r\n\nexplanation of  the inconsistency  is weak  because at  the first\r\n\ntrial he testified that Gary actually had worn gloves at the time\r\n\nof arrest  -- not  that he  mistakenly believed  at  the time  of\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\narrest  that Gary was wearing  gloves.  However,  it is axiomatic\r\n\nthat inconsistent testimony is not per se perjurious.  See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

The defendant neither asked the trial court to\r\n\nmake any findings  of perjury, nor  moved for a mistrial  on that\r\n\nbasis.   We decline defendant's  invitation to make  a finding of\r\n\nwillful  intent to  provide false  testimony based  solely on  an\r\n\ninconsistency.  \r\n\n          Moreover, because Gary's first  trial did not result in\r\n\na conviction, he was not prejudiced even if Arzoomanian testified\r\n\nfalsely.  Cf. Kyles v. Whitley,    U.S.   , 115 S.

The  first\r\n\ntrial ended with a hung jury, and Gary received a second trial at\r\n\nwhich  he   was  fully  able  to  impeach  Arzoomanian  with  his\r\n\ninconsistent testimony at the first trial.

In this case, there is absolutely no evidence\r\n\nto  buttress  a finding  of deliberate  prosecutorial misconduct,\r\n\nand,  at  worst,  Arzoomanian's  alleged  perjury  related  to  a\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\ncollateral matter.  Therefore, the Double Jeopardy Clause did not\r\n\nprohibit Gary's second trial and subsequent conviction.\r\n\n          F.  Application of Sentencing Guidelines \r                    F.  Application of Sentencing Guidelines \r\n\n          Gary asserts that the  trial judge erred in calculating\r\n\nhis sentence under U.S.S.G.    4B1.4.  This provision  determines\r\n\nthe offense  level and criminal  history category of  persons who\r\n\nare subject to an enhanced  sentence under the ACCA, 18  U.S.C.  \r\n\n924(e).   Gary  does  not  contest that  he  is  an armed  career\r\n\ncriminal.   Rather, he  argues that  the trial  judge incorrectly\r\n\napplied U.S.S.G.    4B1.4(b)(3)(A) to arrive at  an offense level\r\n\nof 34  when she should  have used    4B1.4(b)(1) to  arrive at  a\r\n\nlower level.8   We review  questions of interpretation  under the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8  U.S.S.G. 4B1.4 provides in pertinent part:\r\n\n            (a) A  defendant who  is  subject  to  an\r\n                enhanced    sentence     under    the\r\n                provisions  of 18 U.S.C.    924(e) is\r\n                an armed career criminal.\r\n\n            (b) The offense level for an armed career\r\n                criminal is the greatest of:\r\n                (1)  the  offense   level  applicable\r\n                     from Chapters Two and Three; or\r\n                (2)  the  offense level  from   4B1.1\r\n                     (Career Offender) if applicable;\r\n                     or\r\n                (3)(A)  34, if the defendant  used or\r                                  34\r\n                        possessed   the  firearm   or\r\n                        ammunition in connection with\r\n                        a   crime   of  violence   or\r\n                        controlled substance offense,\r\n                        as defined  in   4B1.2(1), or\r\n                        if  the firearm  possessed by\r\n                        the defendant was  of a  type\r\n                        described   in    26   U.S.C.\r\n                          5845(a)[]; or\r\n                   (B)  33, otherwise.[ ]\r                                  33\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\nguidelines de  novo.

Ct. 1830\r                                          \r\n\n(1993).\r\n\n          U.S.S.G.    4B1.4  instructs the  sentencing  judge  to\r\n\nselect  the  offense  level  that  is  the  \"greatest\"  of  three\r\n\ncategories.   First, there is  the offense level  applicable from\r\n\nthe underlying offense,  which here is  U.S.S.G.   2K2.1  dealing\r\n\nwith unlawful  possession of a firearm.  As Gary had at least two\r\n\nprior  felony  convictions of  either a  crime  of violence  or a\r\n\ncontrolled substance offense, he  would receive a minimum offense\r\n\nlevel  of 24  under  this  provision.    Because  Gary  \"used  or\r\n\npossessed\"  the  firearm  \"in  connection  with\"  another  felony\r\n\noffense  (i.e.,  breaking  and  entering), which  results  in  an\r\n\nincrease  of four  levels  under U.S.S.G.    2K2.1(b)(5),  Gary's\r\n\npresentence  report calculated his base offense level at 28.  PSR\r\n\n   14-15.   The  report then  added a  three-level victim-related\r\n\nadjustment for assaulting a police officer pursuant to U.S.S.G.  \r\n\n3A1.2(b) to reach an adjusted offense level of 31.  PSR   20.\r\n\n          Gary  disputes this  interpretation of  the guidelines.\r\n\nThis Court  recently held that use of a firearm in an assault and\r\n\nbattery  warranted  the  four-level  enhancement  under  U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  2K2.1(b)(5).   United States v. Sturtevant, 62 F.3d 33, 34 (1st\r                                                      \r\n\nCir. 1995) (per curiam).   Gary's possession of a  firearm during\r\n\nthe breaking  and entering  similarly qualifies as  possession in\r\n\nconnection with  another felony and would  require enhancement to\r\n\nlevel 28  were we to find that   2K2.1 controls.  Thus, including\r\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\nthe  victim-related  adjustment, the  correct  underlying offense\r\n\nlevel \"from Chapters  Two and  Three\" of the  guidelines was  31.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   4B1.4(b)(1).\r\n\n          The second  category,  which would  adopt  the  offense\r\n\nlevel from U.S.S.G.   4B1.1, is  not applicable here.  U.S.S.G.  \r\n\n4B1.1 does  not apply because the \"instant offense\" (i.e., felon-\r\n\nin-possession of  a firearm)  is not  a crime of  violence.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nU.S.S.G.   4B1.2 comment n.2; United States v.

Because  the judge  must  select the\r\n\ngreatest  of the three  categories, 33  is the  minimum \"default\"\r                                                                 \r\n\noffense level  available under this provision  without a downward\r\n\nadjustment for  acceptance of responsibility.   See United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  George, 56 F.3d 1078, 1086  (9th Cir.), cert. denied,    U.S.\r                                                                  \r\n\n  , 116 S. Ct. 351 (1995).  Gary's arguments for an offense level\r\n\nany lower than 33 are misplaced.\r\n\n          Finding that Gary  possessed the firearm  in connection\r\n\nwith a  violent crime (i.e.,  breaking and  entering), the  trial\r\n\njudge   adopted  34   as  the   offense  level   pursuant   to   \r\n\n4B1.4(b)(3)(A).9  The court  calculated the guidelines sentencing\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n9    At  Gary's  sentencing,  the  trial  court  held  that  \"the\r\npossession of a gun must be found to have either  been used or to\r\nhave  facilitated   the  commission   of  another   offense\"  and\r\ndetermined that  Gary's possession  of a firearm  facilitated the\r\ncommission of the breaking and enterings. \r\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\nrange to be  262-327 months (offense  level 34, criminal  history\r\n\ncategory VI) and imposed a sentence of 290 months.  Gary contests\r\n\nthe trial court's  interpretation of  U.S.S.G.    4B1.4(b)(3)(A).\r\n\nBecause  a felon-in-possession  charge  is not  itself a  violent\r\n\ncrime,  see Doe,  960 F.2d  at 226,  Gary argues  that the  court\r                         \r\n\nshould not have imposed an offense level of 34.  He also contends\r\n\nthat  the  breaking and  entering charge  cannot  be used  as the\r\n\npredicate violent crime because  there is an insufficient \"nexus\"\r\n\nbetween the firearm and the alleged state offense.\r\n\n          Making  a determination under U.S.S.G.   4B1.4(b)(3)(A)\r\n\ninvolves  a  two-step inquiry.    First,  the court  must  decide\r\n\nwhether the predicate offense  is a violent felony.   Second, the\r\n\ncourt must  consider whether  the defendant  used or possessed  a\r\n\nfirearm in connection with that violent predicate offense.\r\n\n          In  making the first inquiry, the court is to employ \"a\r\n\nformal categorical  approach\" irrespective of the  actual factual\r\n\ncircumstances  of  the  underlying  offense.   Taylor  v.  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates, 495 U.S. 575, 600 (1990) (holding that court must look to\r                \r\n\nstatutory definition  of ACCA predicate offenses).   To determine\r\n\nwhat constitutes a violent crime under U.S.S.G.   4B1.4(b)(3)(A),\r\n\nthe court must  turn to  the definition provided  in    4B1.2(1).\r\n\n\"[That] guideline proceeds to  define as a crime of  violence any\r\n\noffense which 'otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious\r\n\npotential  risk of physical injury to another.'\"  Fiore, 983 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat  4 (quoting U.S.S.G.    4B1.2(1)(ii)).  In  that case, we held\r\n\nthat a prior  conspiracy conviction for burglary of  a commercial\r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\npremise was a violent  crime for purposes of the  career offender\r\n\nguideline,  U.S.S.G.     4B1.2.10     Fiore,  983  F.2d  at  4-5.\r                                                     \r\n\nBreaking and entering similarly is a violent crime under U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  4B1.4.

Here, the court is to\r\n\nconsider the  facts to  determine whether  there is a  sufficient\r\n\nnexus  between possession of  the firearm  and commission  of the\r\n\nunderlying offense.  See United States v. Samuels, 970 F.2d 1312,\r                                                           \r\n\n1316 (4th Cir.  1992) (determining whether  firearm was used  \"in\r\n\nconnection with\" crime of violence \"requires the sentencing court\r\n\nto consider the factual circumstances surrounding the [18 U.S.C.]\r\n\n  922(g) offense.\").  \r\n\n          In construing a similar guidelines  provision, U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  2K2.1(b)(5), we have held that \"the phrase 'in connection with'\r\n\nshould  be  interpreted broadly  and  [  ]  where  a  defendant's\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n10  We also note that  in Fiore, as here, the commercial burglary\r                                         \r\noccurred in  Rhode Island,  which defines  burglary, in  part, as\r\nbreaking and entering a shop with the intent to commit robbery or\r\nlarceny.  983 F.2d  at 4 n.6;  see also R.I.

This  is\r\n\nbecause \"the weapon provides an added sense of security and has a\r\n\nsubstantial potential  for use  in the course  of the  particular\r\n\ncrime in question.\"  Id. at 34; United States v.

Tuesta-Toro, 29 F.3d 771, 773 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 947, 130 L.Ed.2d 890 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 14, 1994, Gary and a friend, Eric Hopkins, spent part of the evening going to nightclubs.  After midnight, Patrolman James Joseph Corry of the North Providence Police Department encountered Gary and Hopkins when they were attempting to break into Rhode Island Auto Radio.  Earlier that evening, they had stolen some vases from a furniture store elsewhere in North Providence.  Upon seeing Corry, Hopkins fled on foot and Gary attempted to escape by car at high speed.  Gary lost control of the vehicle, which left the road and struck the foundation of an adjacent building.  Corry caught up to Gary as he was attempting to exit the wrecked automobile.  Gary resisted arrest, and the efforts of several officers were necessary to subdue him.  Once the officers successfully apprehended Gary, they conducted a \"pat-down\" search for weapons.  At that time, a loaded and fully-operable Colt .25 caliber handgun fell from Gary's waistband.  Hopkins also was arrested, and a Dickson .25 caliber semi-automatic pistol was seized from him.  Hopkins later admitted to possessing the firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gary and Hopkins each were initially charged in state court with violations of the Rhode Island General Laws.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  On June 9, 1994, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging both with possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g).  On August 31, 1994, the government filed a notice that, if Gary was convicted, it would seek a penalty enhancement pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(1).  Hopkins pled guilty, on September 8, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From October 13 to 17, 1994, Gary was tried by a jury before Judge Raymond J. Pettine.  Hopkins, who was represented by counsel, testified on Gary's behalf and was cross-examined by the government concerning the break-ins, the circumstances of the arrest, and the firearms.  The proceedings ended in a mistrial when the jury announced that it was unable to reach a verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gary's case then was transferred to Judge Mary M. Lisi, before whom the second jury trial commenced on October 25, 1994.  When Gary attempted to call Hopkins to the stand, however, the government objected on the grounds that Hopkins would invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during cross-examination.  At a conference and subsequent voir dire outside the presence of the jury, Gary proffered that Hopkins would testify that, while they were together at nightclubs on the night of May 14, 1994, he never saw Gary possess a firearm and that they were together until approximately ten minutes preceding the automobile wreck after which Gary was arrested.  In the voir dire, Hopkins asserted his privilege against self-incrimination in response to questioning about the breaking and entering, which immediately preceded his arrest.  Hopkins was then facing pending state breaking and entering charges and a parole revocation proceeding and had not yet been sentenced on the federal charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Hopkins had testified in the first trial regarding the breaking and entering and had been assisted by counsel at that time, the court held that his prior testimony was not a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of his Fifth Amendment privilege, particularly because Hopkins' separate counsel for the state proceedings had not been informed that Hopkins would be appearing in federal court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Moreover, the court held that the government's intended cross-examination regarding the breaking and entering was \"germane\" and \"permissible\" and thus refused to restrict its scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After excusing Hopkins from testifying, the court permitted Gary to introduce Hopkins' prior recorded testimony from the first trial by having it read to the jury by Hopkins' state counsel.  Notwithstanding this ruling, Gary argued that his Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process was violated and moved for a mistrial on that ground.  This motion was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty on October 28, 1995.  Gary was sentenced as an armed career criminal to twenty-four years and two months imprisonment, five years of supervised release, and a $50 special assessment.  Judgment was entered on January 19, 1995, and Gary filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Sixth Amendment Compulsory Process</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case requires us to harmonize a conflict between a defendant's Sixth Amendment right \"to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor,\" U.S. Const. amend.  VI, and the government's interest in cross-examining a defense witness who has invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gary contends that his right to compulsory process was denied when the trial court refused to permit Hopkins to testify and instead only permitted Hopkins' testimony from the first trial to be read to the jury.  Gary argues that the trial court should have required Hopkins to invoke his right against self-incrimination during cross-examination in the jury's presence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The right to offer the testimony of witnesses, and to compel their attendance, if necessary, is in plain terms the right to present a defense....  This right is a fundamental element of due process of law.\"  Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 1923, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967);  see also Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 302, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 1049, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973).  The Sixth Amendment, however, does not provide \"an unfettered right to offer testimony that is incompetent, privileged, or otherwise inadmissible under standard rules of evidence.\"  Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 400, 410, 108 S.Ct. 646, 653, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988).  As the Supreme Court noted in an opinion upholding a trial judge's decision to preclude a defense witness's testimony on evidentiary grounds, \"[t]he Sixth Amendment does not confer the right to present testimony free from the legitimate demands of the adversary system;  one cannot invoke the Sixth Amendment as a justification for presenting what might have been a half-truth.\"  United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 241, 95 S.Ct. 2160, 2171, 45 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the government's interest in cross-examining defense witnesses is not rooted in the Constitution, see United States v. Pardo, 636 F.2d 535, 542 n. 21 (D.C.Cir.1980) (\"The government of course has no Sixth Amendment or other constitutional right to cross-examine defense witnesses.\"), one of the legitimate demands of the adversary system is the right of cross-examination.  See Fed.R.Evid. 611(b) (permitting cross-examination \"limited to subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of witness\").  \"Cross-examination is the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested.\"  Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 316, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 1110, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974).  As Professor Wigmore stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>The main and essential purpose of confrontation is to secure for the opponent the opportunity of cross-examination.   The opponent demands confrontation, not for the idle purpose of gazing upon the witness, or of being gazed upon by him, but for the purpose of cross-examination, which cannot be had except by the direct and personal putting of questions and obtaining immediate answers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5 J.

Stubbert, 655 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir.1981) (quoting same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have not permitted defendants to call witnesses to the stand who have indicated that they will refuse to answer the government's questions on cross-examination with respect to non-collateral matters.  In United States v. De La Cruz, 996 F.2d 1307 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 356, 126 L.Ed.2d 320 (1993), the defendant called his friend and former co-defendant as a witness, but in a voir dire examination, he refused to answer any questions other than his name and address on self-incrimination grounds.  In response to the suggestion that the government's cross-examination should be limited so that the defense witness's privilege need not be invoked, we held that \"effective cross-examination would have been seriously impaired if the prosecutor were denied latitude to explore the joint criminal history\" and affirmed the trial judge's decision not to permit the witness to testify.  Id. at 1312-14.   See also United States v. Parcels of Land, 903 F.2d 36, 43 (1st Cir.1990) (\"It is well-accepted that a witness's direct testimony can be stricken if she invokes the fifth amendment on cross-examination to shield that testimony from scrutiny.\")  (citing cases);  United States v.

Esparsen, 930 F.2d 1461, 1469-70 (10th Cir.1991) (same), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1036, 112 S.Ct. 882, 116 L.Ed.2d 786 (1992);  United States v. Doddington, 822 F.2d 818, 822 (8th Cir.1987) (trial court properly struck direct testimony of defense witness who invoked Fifth Amendment during cross-examination).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attempting to combat this solid phalanx of precedent, Gary cites cases in which courts permitted government witnesses to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination during defendant's cross-examination without violating the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.  See United States v. Berrio-Londono, 946 F.2d 158, 160-61 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1114, 112 S.Ct. 1223, 117 L.Ed.2d 459 (1992);  Stubbert, 655 F.2d at 457-58.   Each of these cases rely on the Second Circuit's much-cited holding in United States v. Cardillo, 316 F.2d 606, 611 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 822, 84 S.Ct. 60, 11 L.Ed.2d 55 (1963) that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>In determining whether the testimony of a witness who invokes the privilege against self-incrimination during cross-examination may be used against the defendant, a distinction must be drawn between cases in which the assertion of the privilege merely precludes inquiry into collateral matters which bear only on the credibility of the witness and those cases in which the assertion of the privilege prevents inquiry into matters about which the witness testified on direct examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When cross-examination is precluded only with respect to collateral issues, the Sixth Amendment does not require the court to strike the witness's testimony.  See Berrio-Londono, 946 F.2d at 161 (refusing to strike direct testimony when cross-examination limited to issues \"not relevant to Berrio- Londono's guilt or innocence\");  Stubbert, 655 F.2d at 457-58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When cross-examination on material issues raised on direct examination is curtailed because of a witness's valid claim of privilege, however, the trial court, in its discretion, may refuse to permit that witness's testimony.  See De La Cruz, 996 F.2d at 1313-14.   Just as the trial court must be vigilant in ensuring that a defendant has a full and fair cross-examination, see Cardillo, 316 F.2d at 611, it must similarly safeguard the government's cross-examination \"to prevent coconspirators from 'whitewashing' each other through the use of testimony unchallengeable for one reason or another.\"  Zirpolo, 704 F.2d at 26 (quoting United States v. Lowell, 649 F.2d 950, 962 (3d Cir.1981)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recognized that it \"may sometimes be feasible for a district court to reconcile the defendant's right to present witnesses with a witness's privilege against self-incrimination by limiting the scope of the latter's testimony.\"  Id. at 26.   In striking the appropriate balance between a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights and the government's interest in cross-examination, a \"trial judge may or even must limit the government's cross-examination on collateral matters if this can be done without unduly limiting the government and if doing so will preserve the defendant's ability to call a material witness who would otherwise claim the privilege.\"  De La Cruz, 996 F.2d at 1313;  see also Pardo, 636 F.2d at 544 (\"[W]here the rights of the defendant and the government can be reconciled, the defendant's constitutional right to procure testimony in his favor must prevail.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, a defense witness's claim of privilege shields material testimony from cross-examination, however, this balance weighs against the defendant.  The trial court held a voir dire hearing to determine whether the subject matter concerning which the witness intended to assert the Fifth Amendment was collateral.  She fairly concluded that it was not.  See Fed.R.Evid. 611(b) (giving court authority to exercise reasonable control over examination of witnesses to \"make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering similar types of challenges brought under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, we have applied an abuse of discretion standard.  See Berrio-Londono, 946 F.2d at 160 (holding that trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to strike witness's testimony on direct examination when witness asserted Fifth Amendment on collateral matters on cross-examination, particularly when witness was required to invoke privilege in presence of jury).  We apply the same abuse of discretion standard in determining kindred challenges under the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment.  See United States v. Blum, 62 F.3d 63, 67 (2d Cir.1995) (applying abuse of discretion standard to review evidentiary decision challenged on Compulsory Process Clause ground).  We find no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Gary's proffer, \"Hopkins would have testified that during the course of the evening, he was able to observe [Gary] and never visually saw a firearm on his person, nor was one detected by the metal detectors, or doorman at the nightclubs.\"   Hopkins' testimony certainly was material to the defense as it showed that, after a significant period of observation, he did not see Gary possess a firearm.  However, at the first trial, Hopkins testified that the pair had been involved in two instances of breaking and entering after leaving the clubs and that he did not know whether Gary had hidden a gun in his car before going to the clubs.  Had Hopkins been permitted to testify and to refuse to answer questions regarding the breaking and entering, as he told the court he would, the government's cross-examination of Hopkins would have been rendered ineffective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus the trial court found, \"[t]he matters that Mr. Hopkins would have testified to and, in fact, did testify to at the previous trial were closely related in time and space to the matter that is before the Court in which the jury must consider.  And therefore, all of the information that would have been elicited or attempted to have been elicited by the Government would have been germane and would have been permissible.\"   We discern no abuse of discretion in the trial court's determination that the subject matter of the cross-examination as to which Hopkins would have asserted his privilege was material and relevant.  Any limitation on cross-examination would have been unduly prejudicial to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, in striking the appropriate balance, the trial court took into consideration that Gary was not deprived of an opportunity to present Hopkins' testimony.  Although Hopkins did not appear personally in the second trial, his testimony from the first trial was read in full to the jury.  It was read with counsel for the government and for Gary each reading their respective parts and a third person reading Hopkins' responses.  Indeed, at oral argument Gary's counsel engaged in a brief thespian demonstration intended to convey the desiccated manner in which Hopkins' testimony was read at Gary's second trial.  We noted then, and reiterate today, that whenever transcript testimony is admitted in a trial, the fact-finder is deprived of a full-fledged opportunity to assess directly the credibility and demeanor of the declarant.  The rules of evidence, however, permit such evidence to be admitted at trial.  See Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1) (former testimony exception to hearsay rule).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gary suggests that, rather than prohibit Hopkins' live testimony altogether, the trial court should have permitted Hopkins to testify on direct examination and forced him to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege on cross-examination in the presence of the jury.  That solution, Gary argues, strikes a more appropriate balance between the government's and the defendant's interests because \"the government could have used the transcript to impeach this testimony or could have relied upon the adverse inference of the witness's invocation of the Fifth.\"   This approach finds some support in United States v. Kaplan, 832 F.2d 676 (1st Cir.1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 907, 108 S.Ct. 1080, 99 L.Ed.2d 239 (1988), where we held that when \"a non-party government witness invokes the Fifth Amendment on cross-examination at trial, the court should permit the assertion of the privilege in the presence of the jury.  The invocation of the privilege acts as a form of impeachment.\"  Id. at 684.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Kaplan, we distinguished United States v. Johnson, 488 F.2d 1206 (1st Cir.1973), in which we held that a court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow a defense witness to take the stand when, after direct examination was completed, that witness would assert the Fifth Amendment as to \"essentially all\" questions on cross-examination.  Id. at 1211.   The basis for the distinction follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>A different case is presented where, as here, the defense seeks to cross-examine a government witness within the scope of his direct and then the witness asserts the privilege.  We note, first, that the impact on the jury's deliberations from asserting the privilege has to be less here than in Johnson from the fact that Brown did not claim the privilege comprehensively.  Instead, Brown answered most questions put to him by the defense and could have refused to answer at trial only those bearing on the alleged cocaine abuse.  And whatever danger exists that the jury may give too much weight to this line of questioning is small in comparison to its impeachment value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kaplan, 832 F.2d at 684.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike Kaplan, where the invocation of the Fifth Amendment pertained to a collateral matter--the effect of alleged cocaine abuse on the witness's power of memory or observation--here the assertion of the privilege would have shielded the witness from testifying on a core issue addressed on direct examination.  Hopkins' claim of privilege would have precluded government inquiry into the intervening events between the time Hopkins observed the defendant to have no firearm and the time the police officer testified he saw a gun in defendant's possession.  Such testimony would have been directly relevant to Gary's guilt or innocence.  Accordingly, while the trial judge may have had the discretion to strike a balance along the lines proposed by the defendant,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> there was no abuse of discretion in striking the balance a different way.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

Therefore, he contends, the trial court wrongly sustained Hopkins' claim of privilege in the second trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Amendment privilege is \"fundamental to our system of constitutional rule.\"  Miranda v.

United States, 340 U.S. 367, 372-73, 71 S.Ct. 438, 442, 95 L.Ed. 344 (1951).  Thus the privilege may be waived, see id. at 370-71, 71 S.Ct. at 400-41, or obviated by a prosecutorial grant of immunity.  See Kastigar v.

Cain, 544 F.2d 1113, 1117 (1st Cir.1976) (co-defendant's submission to deposition in unrelated criminal proceeding not waiver of Fifth Amendment in proceeding in which co-defendant called as witness);  see also Johnson, 488 F.2d at 1210-11 (witness's disclosures in entering guilty plea at Rule 11 hearing do not constitute waiver of privilege at co-defendant's trial);  Kirane v.

Although the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is subject to the constitutional guarantee of equal protection and \"may not be deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification,\" Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 608, 105 S.Ct. 1524, 1531, 84 L.Ed.2d 547 (1985) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), the prosecutor is entitled to \"a threshold presumption that [he] acted 'in good faith for reasons of sound governmental policy.' \"  United States v.

In a brief colloquy on the morning of trial, Gary's counsel first raised the issue of selective prosecution to the trial judge but admitted that she had not filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing.  In the absence of exceptional circumstances--and none are presented here--a claim of selective prosecution that is not raised prior to trial is deemed waived.  Tracey v. United States, 739 F.2d 679, 682 (1st Cir.1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1109, 105 S.Ct. 787, 83 L.Ed.2d 781 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the motion had been timely filed, the burden is upon the defendant to make an initial showing that an evidentiary hearing is warranted.  \"A selective prosecution claim merits evidentiary hearing if it alleges sufficient 'facts a) tending to show that [defendant] has been selectively prosecuted and b) raising a reasonable doubt about the propriety of the prosecution's purpose' ... unless the government can present countervailing reasons.\"  Penagaricano-Soler, 911 F.2d at 838 (quoting Saade, 652 F.2d at 1135).   A trial judge's decision not to hold an evidentiary hearing is reviewed for abuse of discretion.

Gary attempts to make the required showing to this Court by appending \"statistics\" purporting to demonstrate evidence of systemic selective prosecution in the District of Rhode Island.  Gary did not present this information to the trial court, and we will not consider on appeal evidentiary submissions that were not presented below.  United States v. Kobrosky, 711 F.2d 449, 457 (1st Cir.1983).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Reliance on Perjured Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gary contends that his conviction was somehow tainted by allegedly perjurious testimony that was elicited in his first trial.  Specifically, he contends that Officer John Arzoomanian of the North Providence Police Department committed perjury at the first trial when testifying as to why he did not fingerprint the firearm that was seized from Gary.  In Gary's first trial, in response to a question on re-direct examination as to why he did not attempt to recover fingerprints, he answered:  \"As far as the size of the gun--the surface of the weapon, also the people involved in the case both had gloves on.\"  (emphasis added).  On re-cross, Arzoomanian hedged:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. And you didn't bother to attempt to lift a print in this case because this man had gloves on;  is that your testimony?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Well, there were gloves found at the scene and gloves found in the vehicle also.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the second trial, however, Arzoomanian testified that after the arrest, but before the first trial, he learned that the gloves actually belonged to rescue personnel.  He explained:  \"You asked the reason why I didn't print the weapon.  I said because he had gloves on.  And I found out later, he didn't.  At that point, the evidence was handled by too many people.\"   As Gary's counsel ably emphasized during cross-examination, Arzoomanian's testimony in the two proceedings was inconsistent.  Gary asserts that Arzoomanian therefore committed perjury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arzoomanian's testimony in the second trial did differ in a troubling way from that given in the first trial.  His explanation of the inconsistency is weak because at the first trial he testified that Gary actually had worn gloves at the time of arrest--not that he mistakenly believed at the time of arrest that Gary was wearing gloves.  However, it is axiomatic that inconsistent testimony is not per se perjurious.  See United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 93, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993) (\"A witness testifying under oath or affirmation [commits criminal perjury] if she gives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake or faulty memory.\")  (emphasis added).  The defendant neither asked the trial court to make any findings of perjury, nor moved for a mistrial on that basis.  We decline defendant's invitation to make a finding of willful intent to provide false testimony based solely on an inconsistency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, because Gary's first trial did not result in a conviction, he was not prejudiced even if Arzoomanian testified falsely.  Cf. Kyles v. Whitley, --- U.S. ----, ---- n. 7, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 1565 n. 7, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995) (\"[A] conviction obtained by the knowing use of perjured testimony is fundamentally unfair, and must be set aside if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.\")  (quoting United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 103, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2397, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976)).  Here, there is neither a conviction nor any evidence that indicates that the prosecution intentionally used perjured testimony.  The first trial ended with a hung jury, and Gary received a second trial at which he was fully able to impeach Arzoomanian with his inconsistent testimony at the first trial.  In order to bootstrap an allegation of prejudice stemming from Arzoomanian's testimony, Gary argues that his second trial was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  This suggestion that double jeopardy prohibits a second trial because of the unknowing presentation of purportedly perjured testimony by a prosecutor is wholly unsupported by case law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, courts have held that prosecutorial misconduct must rise to an egregious level for double jeopardy to bar a retrial.  A defendant cannot be retried only \"where the misconduct of the prosecutor is undertaken ... to prevent an acquittal that [he] believed at the time was likely to occur in the absence of his misconduct.\"  United States v. Wallach, 979 F.2d 912, 916 (2d Cir.1992) (holding that prosecutorial misconduct bars retrial after conviction overturned because of perjured testimony only where this stringent standard met), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2414, 124 L.Ed.2d 637 (1993);  see also Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, 679, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 2091-92, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982) (retrial after defense moves for mistrial barred by double jeopardy only where \"the conduct giving rise to the successful motion ... was intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial\");  United States v. Cartagena-Carrasquillo, 70 F.3d 706, 714-15 (1st Cir.1995) (when no evidence of prosecutorial misconduct, defendant's successful motion for mistrial does not trigger double jeopardy).  In this case, there is absolutely no evidence to buttress a finding of deliberate prosecutorial misconduct, and, at worst, Arzoomanian's alleged perjury related to a collateral matter.  Therefore, the Double Jeopardy Clause did not prohibit Gary's second trial and subsequent conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. Application of Sentencing Guidelines</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gary asserts that the trial judge erred in calculating his sentence under U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.4.  This provision determines the offense level and criminal history category of persons who are subject to an enhanced sentence under the ACCA, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e).  Gary does not contest that he is an armed career criminal.  Rather, he argues that the trial judge incorrectly applied U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) to arrive at an offense level of 34 when she should have used Sec. 4B1.4(b)(1) to arrive at a lower level.<sup>8</sup>  We review questions of interpretation under the guidelines de novo.  See United States v. Fiore, 983 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 1024, 113 S.Ct. 1830, 123 L.Ed.2d 458 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.4 instructs the sentencing judge to select the offense level that is the \"greatest\" of three categories.  First, there is the offense level applicable from the underlying offense, which here is U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1 dealing with unlawful possession of a firearm.  As Gary had at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, he would receive a minimum offense level of 24 under this provision.  Because Gary \"used or possessed\" the firearm \"in connection with\" another felony offense (i.e., breaking and entering), which results in an increase of four levels under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(b)(5), Gary's presentence report calculated his base offense level at 28.  PSR p 14-15.  The report then added a three-level victim-related adjustment for assaulting a police officer pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 3A1.2(b) to reach an adjusted offense level of 31.  PSR p 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gary disputes this interpretation of the guidelines.  This Court recently held that use of a firearm in an assault and battery warranted the four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(b)(5).  United States v. Sturtevant, 62 F.3d 33, 34 (1st Cir.1995) (per curiam).  Gary's possession of a firearm during the breaking and entering similarly qualifies as possession in connection with another felony and would require enhancement to level 28 were we to find that Sec. 2K2.1 controls.  Thus, including the victim-related adjustment, the correct underlying offense level \"from Chapters Two and Three\" of the guidelines was 31.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.4(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second category, which would adopt the offense level from U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1, is not applicable here.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1 does not apply because the \"instant offense\" (i.e., felon-in-possession of a firearm) is not a crime of violence.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2 comment n. 2;  United States v. Doe, 960 F.2d 221, 226 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third category directs the court to adopt an offense level of 34 if the \"defendant used or possessed the firearm or ammunition in connection with a crime of violence\" or 33 in all other cases.  Because the judge must select the greatest of the three categories, 33 is the minimum \"default\" offense level available under this provision without a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.  See United States v. George, 56 F.3d 1078, 1086 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 351, 133 L.Ed.2d 247 (1995).  Gary's arguments for an offense level any lower than 33 are misplaced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding that Gary possessed the firearm in connection with a violent crime (i.e., breaking and entering), the trial judge adopted 34 as the offense level pursuant to Sec. 4B1.4(b)(3)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The court calculated the guidelines sentencing range to be 262-327 months (offense level 34, criminal history category VI) and imposed a sentence of 290 months.  Gary contests the trial court's interpretation of U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.4(b)(3)(A).  Because a felon-in-possession charge is not itself a violent crime, see Doe, 960 F.2d at 226, Gary argues that the court should not have imposed an offense level of 34.  He also contends that the breaking and entering charge cannot be used as the predicate violent crime because there is an insufficient \"nexus\" between the firearm and the alleged state offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Making a determination under U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) involves a two-step inquiry.  First, the court must decide whether the predicate offense is a violent felony.  Second, the court must consider whether the defendant used or possessed a firearm in connection with that violent predicate offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making the first inquiry, the court is to employ \"a formal categorical approach\" irrespective of the actual factual circumstances of the underlying offense.  Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (holding that court must look to statutory definition of ACCA predicate offenses).  To determine what constitutes a violent crime under U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.4(b)(3)(A), the court must turn to the definition provided in Sec. 4B1.2(1).  \"[That] guideline proceeds to define as a crime of violence any offense which 'otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.' \"  Fiore, 983 F.2d at 4 (quoting U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(1)(ii)).  In that case, we held that a prior conspiracy conviction for burglary of a commercial premise was a violent crime for purposes of the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Fiore, 983 F.2d at 4-5.   Breaking and entering similarly is a violent crime under U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.4.  Cf. United States v. Patterson, 882 F.2d 595, 602 (1st Cir.1989) (holding that breaking and entering as defined in Massachusetts is violent crime because unauthorized entry of premises of another is a \"crucial factor\" in determining applicability of catch-all provision of ACCA), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1027, 110 S.Ct. 737, 107 L.Ed.2d 755 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to the second part of the inquiry, the trial court found that the defendant possessed a firearm in connection with the breaking and entering.  Here, the court is to consider the facts to determine whether there is a sufficient nexus between possession of the firearm and commission of the underlying offense.  See United States v. Samuels, 970 F.2d 1312, 1316 (4th Cir.1992) (determining whether firearm was used \"in connection with\" crime of violence \"requires the sentencing court to consider the factual circumstances surrounding the [18 U.S.C.] Sec. 922(g) offense.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In construing a similar guidelines provision, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(b)(5), we have held that \"the phrase 'in connection with' should be interpreted broadly and [ ] where a defendant's possession of a firearm aids or facilitates the commission of another offense, the requisite link is present.\"  United States v. Thompson, 32 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1994).  In Sturtevant, 62 F.3d at 33-34, we found that a felon who assaulted a victim with his hands but carried a concealed shotgun used the firearm \"in connection with\" the offense of assault and battery.  This is because \"the weapon provides an added sense of security and has a substantial potential for use in the course of the particular crime in question.\"  Id. at 34;  United States v. Brewster, 1 F.3d 51, 54-55 (1st Cir.1993) (selling drugs and automatic weapon to undercover agent satisfied \"in connection with\" requirement of U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(b)(5)).  We see no reason to treat the identical \"in connection with\" language in U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) differently from that of Sec. 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore have no difficulty upholding the trial court's findings that Gary possessed the firearm \"in connection with\" the breaking and entering.  Gary and Hopkins broke into at least two commercial establishments.  When arrested, both men were in possession of firearms, and merchandise from one of the stores was found in Gary's car.  The trial court found that Gary and Hopkins armed themselves when they decided to commit the breaking and entering for the purpose of facilitating that crime.  \"[W]e review the court's factfinding for clear error, giving due deference to the court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\"  Thompson, 32 F.3d at 4 (citing 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(e)).  There was ample support for the trial judge's findings of fact, and we affirm Gary's sentence under U.S.S.G.

After midnight, Patrolman James Joseph Corry of the North Providence Police Department encountered Gary and Hopkins when they were attempting to break into Rhode Island Auto Radio.  Earlier that evening, they had stolen some vases from a furniture store elsewhere in North Providence.  Upon seeing Corry, Hopkins fled on foot and Gary attempted to escape by car at high speed.  Gary lost control of the vehicle, which left the road and struck the foundation of an adjacent building.  Corry caught up to Gary as he was attempting to exit the wrecked automobile.  Gary resisted arrest, and the efforts of several officers were necessary to subdue him.  Once the officers successfully apprehended Gary, they conducted a \"pat-down\" search for weapons.  At that time, a loaded and fully-operable Colt .25 caliber handgun fell from Gary's waistband.  Hopkins also was arrested, and a Dickson .25 caliber semi-automatic pistol was seized from him.  Hopkins later admitted to possessing the firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gary and Hopkins each were initially charged in state court with violations of the Rhode Island General Laws.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  On June 9, 1994, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging both with possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g).  On August 31, 1994, the government filed a notice that, if Gary was convicted, it would seek a penalty enhancement pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(1).  Hopkins pled guilty, on September 8, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From October 13 to 17, 1994, Gary was tried by a jury before Judge Raymond J. Pettine.  Hopkins, who was represented by counsel, testified on Gary's behalf and was cross-examined by the government concerning the break-ins, the circumstances of the arrest, and the firearms.  The proceedings ended in a mistrial when the jury announced that it was unable to reach a verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gary's case then was transferred to Judge Mary M. Lisi, before whom the second jury trial commenced on October 25, 1994.  When Gary attempted to call Hopkins to the stand, however, the government objected on the grounds that Hopkins would invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during cross-examination.  At a conference and subsequent voir dire outside the presence of the jury, Gary proffered that Hopkins would testify that, while they were together at nightclubs on the night of May 14, 1994, he never saw Gary possess a firearm and that they were together until approximately ten minutes preceding the automobile wreck after which Gary was arrested.  In the voir dire, Hopkins asserted his privilege against self-incrimination in response to questioning about the breaking and entering, which immediately preceded his arrest.  Hopkins was then facing pending state breaking and entering charges and a parole revocation proceeding and had not yet been sentenced on the federal charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Hopkins had testified in the first trial regarding the breaking and entering and had been assisted by counsel at that time, the court held that his prior testimony was not a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of his Fifth Amendment privilege, particularly because Hopkins' separate counsel for the state proceedings had not been informed that Hopkins would be appearing in federal court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Moreover, the court held that the government's intended cross-examination regarding the breaking and entering was \"germane\" and \"permissible\" and thus refused to restrict its scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After excusing Hopkins from testifying, the court permitted Gary to introduce Hopkins' prior recorded testimony from the first trial by having it read to the jury by Hopkins' state counsel.  Notwithstanding this ruling, Gary argued that his Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process was violated and moved for a mistrial on that ground.  This motion was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty on October 28, 1995.  Gary was sentenced as an armed career criminal to twenty-four years and two months imprisonment, five years of supervised release, and a $50 special assessment.  Judgment was entered on January 19, 1995, and Gary filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Sixth Amendment Compulsory Process</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case requires us to harmonize a conflict between a defendant's Sixth Amendment right \"to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor,\" U.S. Const. amend.  VI, and the government's interest in cross-examining a defense witness who has invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gary contends that his right to compulsory process was denied when the trial court refused to permit Hopkins to testify and instead only permitted Hopkins' testimony from the first trial to be read to the jury.  Gary argues that the trial court should have required Hopkins to invoke his right against self-incrimination during cross-examination in the jury's presence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The right to offer the testimony of witnesses, and to compel their attendance, if necessary, is in plain terms the right to present a defense....

The trial court held a voir dire hearing to determine whether the subject matter concerning which the witness intended to assert the Fifth Amendment was collateral.  She fairly concluded that it was not.  See Fed.R.Evid. 611(b) (giving court authority to exercise reasonable control over examination of witnesses to \"make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering similar types of challenges brought under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, we have applied an abuse of discretion standard.

We apply the same abuse of discretion standard in determining kindred challenges under the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment.  See United States v. Blum, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701312\"><a href=\"/opinion/701312/united-states-v-melvin-blum-charles-monteleone/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 67 (2d Cir.1995) (applying abuse of discretion standard to review evidentiary decision challenged on Compulsory Process Clause ground).  We find no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Gary's proffer, \"Hopkins would have testified that during the course of the evening, he was able to observe [Gary] and never visually saw a firearm on his person, nor was one detected by the metal detectors, or doorman at the nightclubs.\"   Hopkins' testimony certainly was material to the defense as it showed that, after a significant period of observation, he did not see Gary possess a firearm.  However, at the first trial, Hopkins testified that the pair had been involved in two instances of breaking and entering after leaving the clubs and that he did not know whether Gary had hidden a gun in his car before going to the clubs.  Had Hopkins been permitted to testify and to refuse to answer questions regarding the breaking and entering, as he told the court he would, the government's cross-examination of Hopkins would have been rendered ineffective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus the trial court found, \"[t]he matters that Mr. Hopkins would have testified to and, in fact, did testify to at the previous trial were closely related in time and space to the matter that is before the Court in which the jury must consider.  And therefore, all of the information that would have been elicited or attempted to have been elicited by the Government would have been germane and would have been permissible.\"   We discern no abuse of discretion in the trial court's determination that the subject matter of the cross-examination as to which Hopkins would have asserted his privilege was material and relevant.  Any limitation on cross-examination would have been unduly prejudicial to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, in striking the appropriate balance, the trial court took into consideration that Gary was not deprived of an opportunity to present Hopkins' testimony.  Although Hopkins did not appear personally in the second trial, his testimony from the first trial was read in full to the jury.  It was read with counsel for the government and for Gary each reading their respective parts and a third person reading Hopkins' responses.  Indeed, at oral argument Gary's counsel engaged in a brief thespian demonstration intended to convey the desiccated manner in which Hopkins' testimony was read at Gary's second trial.  We noted then, and reiterate today, that whenever transcript testimony is admitted in a trial, the fact-finder is deprived of a full-fledged opportunity to assess directly the credibility and demeanor of the declarant.  The rules of evidence, however, permit such evidence to be admitted at trial.  See Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1) (former testimony exception to hearsay rule).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gary suggests that, rather than prohibit Hopkins' live testimony altogether, the trial court should have permitted Hopkins to testify on direct examination and forced him to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege on cross-examination in the presence of the jury.  That solution, Gary argues, strikes a more appropriate balance between the government's and the defendant's interests because \"the government could have used the transcript to impeach this testimony or could have relied upon the adverse inference of the witness's invocation of the Fifth.\"   This approach finds some support in United States v.

We note, first, that the impact on the jury's deliberations from asserting the privilege has to be less here than in Johnson from the fact that Brown did not claim the privilege comprehensively.  Instead, Brown answered most questions put to him by the defense and could have refused to answer at trial only those bearing on the alleged cocaine abuse.  And whatever danger exists that the jury may give too much weight to this line of questioning is small in comparison to its impeachment value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496776\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Kaplan,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/496776/united-states-v-robert-d-kaplan/\"><span class=\"volume\">832</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike Kaplan, where the invocation of the Fifth Amendment pertained to a collateral matter--the effect of alleged cocaine abuse on the witness's power of memory or observation--here the assertion of the privilege would have shielded the witness from testifying on a core issue addressed on direct examination.  Hopkins' claim of privilege would have precluded government inquiry into the intervening events between the time Hopkins observed the defendant to have no firearm and the time the police officer testified he saw a gun in defendant's possession.  Such testimony would have been directly relevant to Gary's guilt or innocence.  Accordingly, while the trial judge may have had the discretion to strike a balance along the lines proposed by the defendant,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> there was no abuse of discretion in striking the balance a different way.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

Reliance on Perjured Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gary contends that his conviction was somehow tainted by allegedly perjurious testimony that was elicited in his first trial.  Specifically, he contends that Officer John Arzoomanian of the North Providence Police Department committed perjury at the first trial when testifying as to why he did not fingerprint the firearm that was seized from Gary.  In Gary's first trial, in response to a question on re-direct examination as to why he did not attempt to recover fingerprints, he answered:  \"As far as the size of the gun--the surface of the weapon, also the people involved in the case both had gloves on.\"  (emphasis added).  On re-cross, Arzoomanian hedged:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. And you didn't bother to attempt to lift a print in this case because this man had gloves on;  is that your testimony?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Well, there were gloves found at the scene and gloves found in the vehicle also.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the second trial, however, Arzoomanian testified that after the arrest, but before the first trial, he learned that the gloves actually belonged to rescue personnel.  He explained:  \"You asked the reason why I didn't print the weapon.  I said because he had gloves on.  And I found out later, he didn't.  At that point, the evidence was handled by too many people.\"   As Gary's counsel ably emphasized during cross-examination, Arzoomanian's testimony in the two proceedings was inconsistent.  Gary asserts that Arzoomanian therefore committed perjury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arzoomanian's testimony in the second trial did differ in a troubling way from that given in the first trial.  His explanation of the inconsistency is weak because at the first trial he testified that Gary actually had worn gloves at the time of arrest--not that he mistakenly believed at the time of arrest that Gary was wearing gloves.  However, it is axiomatic that inconsistent testimony is not per se perjurious.  See United States v. Dunnigan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112821\"><a href=\"/opinion/112821/united-states-v-dunnigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 93, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112821\"><a href=\"/opinion/112821/united-states-v-dunnigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The defendant neither asked the trial court to make any findings of perjury, nor moved for a mistrial on that basis.  We decline defendant's invitation to make a finding of willful intent to provide false testimony based solely on an inconsistency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, because Gary's first trial did not result in a conviction, he was not prejudiced even if Arzoomanian testified falsely.

The first trial ended with a hung jury, and Gary received a second trial at which he was fully able to impeach Arzoomanian with his inconsistent testimony at the first trial.  In order to bootstrap an allegation of prejudice stemming from Arzoomanian's testimony, Gary argues that his second trial was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  This suggestion that double jeopardy prohibits a second trial because of the unknowing presentation of purportedly perjured testimony by a prosecutor is wholly unsupported by case law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, courts have held that prosecutorial misconduct must rise to an egregious level for double jeopardy to bar a retrial.

In this case, there is absolutely no evidence to buttress a finding of deliberate prosecutorial misconduct, and, at worst, Arzoomanian's alleged perjury related to a collateral matter.  Therefore, the Double Jeopardy Clause did not prohibit Gary's second trial and subsequent conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. Application of Sentencing Guidelines</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gary asserts that the trial judge erred in calculating his sentence under U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.4.  This provision determines the offense level and criminal history category of persons who are subject to an enhanced sentence under the ACCA, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e).  Gary does not contest that he is an armed career criminal.  Rather, he argues that the trial judge incorrectly applied U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) to arrive at an offense level of 34 when she should have used Sec. 4B1.4(b)(1) to arrive at a lower level.<sup>8</sup>  We review questions of interpretation under the guidelines de novo.  See United States v. Fiore, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597517\"><a href=\"/opinion/597517/united-states-v-anthony-fiore/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1024</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Sec. 4B1.4 instructs the sentencing judge to select the offense level that is the \"greatest\" of three categories.  First, there is the offense level applicable from the underlying offense, which here is U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1 dealing with unlawful possession of a firearm.  As Gary had at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, he would receive a minimum offense level of 24 under this provision.  Because Gary \"used or possessed\" the firearm \"in connection with\" another felony offense (i.e., breaking and entering), which results in an increase of four levels under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(b)(5), Gary's presentence report calculated his base offense level at 28.  PSR p 14-15.  The report then added a three-level victim-related adjustment for assaulting a police officer pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 3A1.2(b) to reach an adjusted offense level of 31.  PSR p 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gary disputes this interpretation of the guidelines.  This Court recently held that use of a firearm in an assault and battery warranted the four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(b)(5).  United States v. Sturtevant, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196240\"><a href=\"/opinion/196240/united-states-v-sturtevant/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.1995) (per curiam).  Gary's possession of a firearm during the breaking and entering similarly qualifies as possession in connection with another felony and would require enhancement to level 28 were we to find that Sec. 2K2.1 controls.  Thus, including the victim-related adjustment, the correct underlying offense level \"from Chapters Two and Three\" of the guidelines was 31.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.4(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second category, which would adopt the offense level from U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1, is not applicable here.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1 does not apply because the \"instant offense\" (i.e., felon-in-possession of a firearm) is not a crime of violence.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2 comment n. 2;  United States v. Doe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580696\"><a href=\"/opinion/580696/united-states-v-arthur-l-doe-aka-butchy/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span>, 226 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third category directs the court to adopt an offense level of 34 if the \"defendant used or possessed the firearm or ammunition in connection with a crime of violence\" or 33 in all other cases.  Because the judge must select the greatest of the three categories, 33 is the minimum \"default\" offense level available under this provision without a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.  See United States v.

Gary contests the trial court's interpretation of U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.4(b)(3)(A).  Because a felon-in-possession charge is not itself a violent crime, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580696\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Doe,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/580696/united-states-v-arthur-l-doe-aka-butchy/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span>, Gary argues that the court should not have imposed an offense level of 34.  He also contends that the breaking and entering charge cannot be used as the predicate violent crime because there is an insufficient \"nexus\" between the firearm and the alleged state offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Making a determination under U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) involves a two-step inquiry.  First, the court must decide whether the predicate offense is a violent felony.  Second, the court must consider whether the defendant used or possessed a firearm in connection with that violent predicate offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making the first inquiry, the court is to employ \"a formal categorical approach\" irrespective of the actual factual circumstances of the underlying offense.

To determine what constitutes a violent crime under U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.4(b)(3)(A), the court must turn to the definition provided in Sec. 4B1.2(1).  \"[That] guideline proceeds to define as a crime of violence any offense which 'otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.' \"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597517\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Fiore,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/597517/united-states-v-anthony-fiore/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">4</span> </a></span>(quoting U.S.S.G.

Here, the court is to consider the facts to determine whether there is a sufficient nexus between possession of the firearm and commission of the underlying offense.  See United States v. Samuels, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587614\"><a href=\"/opinion/587614/united-states-v-louis-samuels/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1312</span></a></span>, 1316 (4th Cir.1992) (determining whether firearm was used \"in connection with\" crime of violence \"requires the sentencing court to consider the factual circumstances surrounding the [18 U.S.C.] Sec. 922(g) offense.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In construing a similar guidelines provision, U.S.S.G.

Gary and Hopkins broke into at least two commercial establishments.  When arrested, both men were in possession of firearms, and merchandise from one of the stores was found in Gary's car.  The trial court found that Gary and Hopkins armed themselves when they decided to commit the breaking and entering for the purpose of facilitating that crime.  \"[W]e review the court's factfinding for clear error, giving due deference to the court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195550\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Thompson,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195550/united-states-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">4</span> </a></span>(citing 18 U.S.C.
