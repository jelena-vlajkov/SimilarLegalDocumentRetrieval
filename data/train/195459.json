Plaintiff appeals the dismissal of his\n                    \n\ncomplaint, without  prejudice, for  failure to state  a claim\n\nunder the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.   552 (\"FOIA\")\n\nand the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C.   552a.  Plaintiff alleges that\n\ndefendant  constructively  denied  his  written  request  for\n\ndocuments  by  failing to  sign  a receipt  for  the request.\n\nReviewing the  matter  de novo,  we agree  with the  district\n                              \n\ncourt  that the request  which plaintiff allegedly presented,\n\nattached as an  exhibit to  the complaint,  clearly fails  to\n\ncomply  with published regulations.

The request is not properly notarized, does not\n\ninclude other information  reasonably required to verify  the\n\nrequester's  identity, and does  not reasonably  describe the\n\nrecords sought. See 28 C.F.R.    16.3(2),  1641(b)(d).  Since\n                   \n\nthe  complaint shows on its  face that the  plaintiff did not\n\npresent a  proper request,  we need not  consider defendant's\n\nremaining arguments.
