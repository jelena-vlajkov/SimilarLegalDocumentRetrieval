This appeal presents a challenge\r                                      \r\n\nto  a town zoning ordinance  and cease and  desist order that\r\n\nlimit  night-time  access  to   and  from  a  local  trucking\r\n\nterminal.   Appellants are  the terminal owner,  the terminal\r\n\noperator,  various interstate  motor carriers  that regularly\r\n\nuse  the  terminal,  and   an  association  representing  New\r\n\nHampshire truckers.   Appellee is the  Town of Plaistow,  New\r\n\nHampshire, (\"the town\"),  which adopted  the restrictions  at\r\n\nissue.  The terminal is located on a  site partly in Plaistow\r\n\nand partly in Newton, New Hampshire.\r\n\n     The trucking terminal began operation in September 1988.\r\n\nIt serves  as a regional  hub for various  trucking companies\r\n\nserving the New England  area.  Line haulers from  around the\r\n\ncountry drop off freight  to be delivered in New  England and\r\n\npick up  freight whose destination lies  outside New England.\r\n\nAtlas  Motor Express,  Inc.  (\"Atlas\"), the  operator of  the\r\n\nterminal, maintains a fleet of trucks and provides short haul\r\n\nservice within the New  England area.  The terminal  operates\r\n\n24 hours a day, loading and unloading trailers.  \r\n\n     Most trucks that use  the Plaistow/Newton terminal reach\r\n\nit from Interstate  495, a federal highway  that runs through\r\n\nMassachusetts  and  near  the  New Hampshire  border.    From\r\n\nInterstate 495, trucks travel  about 5 miles on Route  125 to\r\n\nKingston  Road (both  are New  Hampshire state  highways) and\r\n\nthen about half a mile to Garland Way, the terminal's private\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\naccess  road.   Trucks  must travel  roughly 2000  feet along\r\n\nGarland  Way, the first  portion of which  passes through the\r\n\nPlaistow residential zone.  The terminal's facilities are all\r\n\nlocated  in  Newton  in   an  industrial  zone  bordering  on\r\n\nPlaistow.\r\n\n     Shortly  after the  terminal opened,  numerous residents\r\n\nfrom  Plaistow who live along  Kingston Road near Garland Way\r\n\ncomplained  about late night  truck traffic  to and  from the\r\n\nterminal.   The town subsequently  served a cease  and desist\r\n\norder on Atlas and  the terminal owner, alleging  a violation\r\n\nof  a  Town  of  Plaistow  zoning  ordinance  that  reads  in\r\n\npertinent part:\r\n\n     Any  uses that  may  be obnoxious  or injurious  by\r\n     reason  of the  production  or emission  of  odors,\r\n     dust, smoke, refuse matter, fumes, noise, vibration\r\n     or  other similar conditions, or that are dangerous\r\n     to the comfort, peace, enjoyment,  health or safety\r\n     of  the community,  whether it  contributes  to its\r\n     disturbance  or  annoyances are  prohibited  in all\r\n     districts.\r\n\nThe  cease and  desist  order stated  that \"heavy  commercial\r\n\ntrucking  arriving  at and  leaving  [the]  site is  emitting\r\n\nodors, smoke,  fumes, noise and vibration  around the clock.\"\r\n\nDespite  the  order, late  night  traffic  to  and  from  the\r\n\nterminal continued.    \r\n\n     The  town  then  brought  an  action  in  New  Hampshire\r\n\nSuperior Court seeking an injunction against the terminal and\r\n\nan order imposing  reasonable hours of operation.   The state\r\n\ncourt entered a preliminary  injunction on February 28, 1989,\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nplacing  a  curfew  on  night-time  access to  and  from  the\r\n\nterminal.   After an evidentiary hearing, the court entered a\r\n\npermanent injunction on July 7, 1989, limiting the terminal's\r\n\nnight-time traffic as follows:\r\n\n     6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.:   No restrictions.\r\n     9:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.:  Two  trucks   may  arrive   or\r\n     depart.\r\n     11:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.:  No   trucks  may   arrive   or\r\n     depart.\r\n     5:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.:   Three  trucks  may  arrive  or\r\n     depart.\r\n\nThe New Hampshire Supreme Court denied the terminal's request\r\n\nfor appellate review.\r\n\n    On  March  26,  1993,  appellants filed  a  federal  suit\r\n\nagainst  the  town,  alleging  that the  enforcement  of  the\r\n\nPlaistow zoning  ordinance was  preempted by  various federal\r\n\nstatutes and by the Commerce Clause.   U.S. Const., Art. I,  \r\n\n8.    On October  25, 1993,  the  district court  granted the\r\n\ntown's motion to dismiss,  for failure to state a  claim, the\r\n\nappellants' claim  that the  injunction was preempted  by the\r\n\nNoise Control  Act of  1972, 42  U.S.C.   4901  et seq.   New\r                                                                         \r\n\nHampshire Motor Transport Ass'n  v. Town of Plaistow,  836 F.\r                                                                \r\n\nSupp. 59 (D.N.H. 1993).\r\n\n     A  three-day  bench  trial   followed  in  August  1994.\r\n\nThereafter,  the  district court  ruled  that  the injunction\r\n\nlimiting night-time access to  and from the trucking terminal\r\n\nwas not  preempted by two  other federal statutes  invoked by\r\n\nthe  appellants--the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n1982,  49 U.S.C.   31101 et seq., and the Hazardous Materials\r                                            \r\n\nTransportation Uniform Safety  Act of 1990, 49 U.S.C.    5101\r\n\net  seq.--and did  not  violate the  Commerce  Clause.   This\r                    \r\n\nappeal  followed.    We   agree  with  the  district  court's\r\n\ndeterminations and affirm.\r\n\n     1.  The town  urges that the district court  judgment be\r\n\nupheld,  without reaching the merits,  on the ground that the\r\n\nstate court enforcement action  is res judicata as to  all of\r                                                           \r\n\nthe appellants.  The reach of a prior state court judgment is\r\n\ndetermined  by  state  law.    Migra v.  Warren  City  School\r                                                                         \r\n\nDistrict Board of Education,  465 U.S. 75 (1984).   Under New\r                                       \r\n\nHampshire  law, we  think that  the prior  judgment does  not\r\n\nforeclose the  present suit, at least by  appellants who were\r\n\nnot parties to the state court action.\r\n\n     The  only defendants in the state  court action were the\r\n\nterminal owner and  its operator.   Non-parties can be  bound\r\n\nwhere they are in privity  with parties to prior  litigation,\r\n\nand the privity concept is fairly elastic under New Hampshire\r\n\nlaw, as elsewhere.   But normally something more  is required\r\n\nfor  privity between  the  prior and  present litigants  than\r\n\nmerely a common interest  in the outcome.  Daigle  v. City of\r                                                                         \r\n\nPortsmouth, 534 A.2d 689, 694 (N.H. 1987).  See also Gonzalez\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Banco Cent.  Corp., 27  F.3d 751, 756-63  (1st Cir.  1994)\r                                 \r\n\n(interpreting federal law).  \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n     Here,  there  is   no  indication  that  the   appellant\r\n\ninterstate carriers  even knew of, let  alone controlled, the\r\n\nprior litigation.  Although the town points out that the same\r\n\nlaw  firm represents  all of  the appellants,  the interstate\r\n\ncarriers are  not claimed to  have controlled or  managed the\r\n\noriginal state court litigation from behind the scenes.   Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\nMontana  v. United States, 440  U.S. 147, 154 (1979); General\r                                                                         \r\n\nFoods  v. Massachusetts Dept.  of Pub. Health,  648 F.2d 784,\r                                                         \r\n\n789  (1st Cir. 1981).   It is also  plain that the interstate\r\n\ncarriers  who use the terminal on a regular basis have a real\r\n\nand distinct interest in nullifying the town's restriction.\r\n\n     Finally, we note that with the exception of the Commerce\r\n\nClause  issue,   the  federal  issues  were   apparently  not\r\n\nlitigated in  the state  court.   This would  not necessarily\r\n\ndefeat  a valid claim of res  judicata, see, e.g., Stuhlreyer\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Armco, Inc.,  12 F.3d  75,  77 (6th  Cir.  1993), but  it\r                           \r\n\nencourages  us to resolve any doubts in favor of allowing the\r\n\ncarriers  to sue.   Since the merits  must be reached  on the\r\n\nappeals by the interstate carriers, we  need not consider the\r\n\nstronger claim of foreclosure  against the owner and operator\r\n\nof the terminal. \r\n\n     2.   Turning to the  merits, our review  of the district\r\n\ncourt's  preemption analyses is  plenary, Ellenwood  v. Exxon\r                                                                         \r\n\nShipping  Co., 984  F.2d  1270, 1273  n.4  (1st Cir.),  cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied, 113 S.  Ct. 2987 (1993), and we address  in turn each\r                  \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nof  the statutes relied on by appellants as a separate ground\r\n\nfor preemption.    Among these,  the  most important  is  the\r\n\nSurface Transportation  Assistance Act of  1982 (\"the Surface\r\n\nAct\"),  as amended  by the  Tandem Truck  Safety Act  of 1984\r\n\n(\"the Tandem Act\"), now codified at 49 U.S.C.   31111 et seq.\r                                                                         \r\n\nThese statutes together establish uniform, national standards\r\n\nfor the maximum size  and weight of trucks and  trailers used\r\n\nin interstate commerce.\r\n\n     As  amended, the  Surface  Act forbids  the states  from\r\n\nenacting or enforcing laws  that prohibit trucks and trailers\r\n\nof approved length and weight from travelling on the national\r\n\nnetwork, i.e.,  the system  of interstate highways  and other\r                         \r\n\nfederally-funded primary routes  designated by the  Secretary\r\n\nof  Transportation.  49 U.S.C.   31111(e); 23 C.F.R.   658.5.\r\n\nThe Surface  Act also prohibits states  from denying approved\r\n\ntrucks and trailers \"reasonable access\" between  the national\r\n\nnetwork and \"terminals.\"  49 U.S.C.   31114.  This provision,\r\n\nwhich is at the heart of this case, reads as follows:\r\n\n       31114.  Access to the Interstate System\r\n\n     (a) Prohibition on denying access.  A State may not\r\n     enact  or enforce  a  law denying  to a  commercial\r\n     motor  vehicle   subject  to  this   subchapter  or\r\n     subchapter  I  of  this  chapter  reasonable access\r\n     between--\r\n\n          (1)   the  Dwight  D.

The terminal is located between five and six miles\r\n\nfrom Interstate  495, the nearest juncture  with the national\r\n\nnetwork.    (Route 125  in  Plaistow  is not  a  part of  the\r\n\nnational  network.    See  23  C.F.R.     658,  app.  A  (New\r                                     \r\n\nHampshire.))   Given this distance, and Plaistow's legitimate\r\n\ninterest in curbing noise,  odor and dust in  its residential\r\n\nareas,  the   district  court   found  that   the  night-time\r\n\nrestrictions were a reasonable compromise. \r\n\n     On  this  appeal,  the   truckers  first  say  that  the\r\n\n\"reasonable  access\" provision  limits state  restrictions to\r\n\nthose  based on safety.   This is a  straightforward issue of\r\n\nstatutory construction which,  absent the \"exception\"  clause\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nquoted above, would easily  be resolved in the  town's favor.\r\n\nAfter  all, the main  provision requires \"reasonable access.\"\r\n\n49 U.S.C.   31114(a).   \"Reasonable\" is a comprehensive term,\r\n\nUnited States  v. Rodriguez-Morales,  929 F.2d 780,  785 (1st\r                                               \r\n\nCir. 1991), cert.  denied, 502 U.S. 1030  (1992), and nothing\r                                     \r\n\nin language or common-sense  makes reasonableness turn solely\r\n\non safety considerations.  \r\n\n     Context  reenforces  this view.   The  \"[p]rohibition on\r\n\ndenying access,\"  49 U.S.C.    31114, extends far  beyond the\r\n\noperation of  interstate highways or  federally funded  state\r\n\nroads  that are  designated  parts of  the national  network.\r\n\nLocal  roads and  other facilities  are also  covered by  the\r\n\nprovision to the extent needed to assure reasonable access to\r\n\nthe national network.  23 C.F.R.    658.19.  The guarantee of\r\n\nreasonable access  thus has a formidable  reach, extending to\r\n\nlocal regulatory  measures that  operate miles away  from any\r\n\ninterstate or national network highway.\r\n\n     Many   of  these  measures  are  designed  to  safeguard\r\n\ninterests  other  than  safety.   Consider,  for  example,  a\r\n\nrestriction  that routed heavy traffic  on a detour  of a few\r\n\nmiles to assure quiet in a hospital zone.  It is difficult to\r\n\nconceive that  Congress meant to exclude such  a concern from\r\n\nthe   calculus  used  to   determine  whether  a  restriction\r\n\ninfringes  on  \"reasonable  access\"  to  the  federal highway\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nsystem.  In this instance, language and policy are  as one in\r\n\nopposing such a restrictive reading.\r\n\n     The  sole  argument  for  limiting  the  restrictions to\r\n\nsafety  matters  stems  from  the  exception  provision,  now\r\n\ncodified as 49 U.S.C.   31114(b).   As a matter of  language,\r\n\nthis  provision  permits, but  does  not  compel, a  negative\r\n\ninference that  the only restrictions allowed  under the main\r\n\nprovision are safety  restrictions.  Because subsections  (a)\r\n\nand  (b) do not  fit neatly together,  it is  difficult to be\r\n\nabsolutely  certain of  Congress'  intent.   But for  several\r\n\nreasons we reject the  suggestion that subsection (b) narrows\r\n\nby inference the concept of reasonableness in subsection (a).\r\n\n     First, the  negative inference is flawed as  a matter of\r\n\nlanguage.   By its terms  the safety exception  in subsection\r\n\n(b) is  concerned not  with safety limitations  generally but\r\n\nwith restrictions on truck  tractor-semitrailer combinations.\r\n\nIf  the  exception  were  taken to  narrow  the  restrictions\r\n\npermitted  under the main \"reasonable access\" provision, then\r\n\narguably  the  only  restrictions  allowed  would  be  safety\r                               \r\n\nrestrictions   directed   to   truck    tractor   semitrailer\r\n\ncombinations, an extremely odd result.\r\n\n     Second,  the  original 1982  Surface  Act  contained the\r\n\nreasonable  access language with  no exception  provision; so\r                                                \r\n\nnothing in 1982 suggested that state access restrictions were\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nlimited  to those based on safety.1   If Congress in 1984 had\r\n\nintended  to alter the  reasonable access provision  so as to\r\n\nlimit the states to safety restrictions, one might reasonably\r\n\nexpect  some indication  of  this  purpose  at least  in  the\r\n\nlegislative history.   Cf. Sierra Club v.  Secretary of Army,\r                                                                        \r\n\n820  F.2d 513,  522 (1st  Cir. 1987).   Congress'  failure to\r\n\nindicate any such purpose argues against appellants' reading.\r\n\nCompare S. Rep.

Among other changes in\r\n\n1984,  Congress expanded  somewhat  the  protected radius  in\r\n\nwhich  truck tractor-semi-trailers  could operate  to include\r\n\ntheir  points of  loading and  unloading.   Since this  was a\r\n\nconcern to state  officials, S. Rep. No.  505 at 1-3; 654  F.\r\n\nSupp.  at 1531,  Congress evidently  balanced this  change by\r\n\nadding subsection (b) as a counter-weight.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1Section 412  of  the Surface  Act,  96 Stat.  at  2160,\r\nprovided:\r\n\n     No  State  may enact  or  enforce  any law  denying\r\n     reasonable  access  to  commercial  motor  vehicles\r\n     subject to this  title between  (1) the  Interstate\r\n     and Defense Highway System and any other qualifying\r\n     Federal-aid Primary System  highways as  designated\r\n     by the Secretary, and (2) terminals, facilities for\r\n     food,  fuel,  repairs,  and  rest,  and  points  of\r\n     loading and unloading for household goods carriers.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\n     We  appreciate  that,  as  appellants point  out,  three\r\n\ndistrict  courts  have  made  references  to the  \"reasonable\r\n\naccess\"  provision as one directed to safety.2  But the state\r\n\nrestrictions with  which  those  cases  were  concerned  were\r\n\nwholly  different  from  and  far  more  intrusive  than  the\r\n\nPlaistow ordinance  and order, including  blanket limitations\r\n\non the distance vehicles could freely travel off the national\r\n\nnetwork and burdensome prior  approval provisions for the use\r\n\nof local roads.  See 681 F. Supp. at 339-40; 654 F.  Supp. at\r                                \r\n\n1529-30;  647 F.  Supp. at  1484-88.   Safety is  obviously a\r\n\nparamount reason for limiting access; but, in our view, it is\r\n\nnot the only reason permitted by Congress.\r\n\n     Having  concluded  that  the  district  court  correctly\r\n\nconstrued  the Surface Act, we have no occasion to review the\r\n\ncourt's  further, fact-specific  decision  that the  Plaistow\r\n\nrestrictions in this  case did permit reasonable access.  The\r\n\nappellants scarcely bother to argue the point; in a couple of\r\n\nsentences,   they  simply  assert  that  the  district  court\r\n\nfindings show that a  truck terminal must operate 24  hours a\r\n\nday.   The opinion does not make such a finding, and we think\r\n\nappellants' cursory argument waives the factual issue in this\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2A.B.F.

The\r                                                                   \r\n\nMaterials  Act establishes  uniform, national  rules for  the\r\n\ntransportation of hazardous materials  and, together with its\r\n\naccompanying regulations, creates an elaborate scheme for the\r\n\ndesignation, handling,  packaging, labeling, and  shipping of\r\n\nhazardous materials.  Like the Surface Act, the Materials Act\r\n\ncontains   an  express  preemption  clause,  which  reads  in\r\n\nrelevant part as follows:\r\n\n       5125.  Preemption\r\n\n          (a)    General.--Except    as   provided    in\r\n     subsections (b),  (c), and (e) of  this section and\r\n     unless  authorized  by another  law  of  the United\r\n     States,   a  requirement  of   a  State,  political\r\n     subdivision   of  a  State,   or  Indian  tribe  is\r\n     preempted if--\r\n\n          (1) complying with a requirement of the State,\r\n          political   subdivision,   or   tribe  and   a\r\n          requirement  of this  chapter or  a regulation\r\n          prescribed under this chapter is not possible;\r\n          or\r\n\n          (2)  the requirement  of the  State, political\r\n          subdivision, or tribe, as applied or enforced,\r\n          is  an obstacle to  accomplishing and carrying\r\n          out  this chapter  or a  regulation prescribed\r\n          under this chapter.\r\n\n     The truckers contend that the curfew is preempted by the\r\n\nsecond provision of the general preemption clause, because it\r\n\ninterferes with \"the  federal speedy-transport mandate,\" N.H.\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\nMotor Transport Ass'n  v.

Because  the  Plaistow  curfew\r\n\nnecessarily  entails  a delay  for  hazardous  materials, the\r\n\ntruckers say that it violates the Materials Act.\r\n\n     By  using  the   word  \"unnecessary,\"  the   regulations\r\n\nindicate  that some delays are necessary and acceptable.

The substance of the appellants' brief on appeal\r\n\nis  that any regime that  creates a possibility  of a 12-hour\r\n\ndelay   in   delivery   ipso   facto   automatically  imposes\r                                                \r\n\n\"unnecessary\" delay.  \r\n\n     A  general, state-wide  restriction  is  obviously  more\r\n\nvulnerable  to attack both because its impact is likely to be\r\n\nmuch  greater  and because  it  treats  alike all  situations\r\n\nregardless  of need or danger.

At\r\n\nleast on  this appeal, appellants  have not even  attempted a\r\n\nserious fact-specific showing.\r\n\n     This case  is quite unlike National  Tank Truck Carrier,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc.  v.

By contrast,  the\r\n\ncurfew at issue  here involves one  terminal, is tailored  to\r\n\nspecific local conditions, and imposes no time restriction on\r\n\nthe delivery of hazardous materials in New Hampshire  so long\r\n\nas   the  Plaistow  terminal  is  not  used  as  a  point  of\r\n\ninterchange.\r\n\n     4.   The  truckers also  challenge the  district court's\r\n\ndismissal  of their claim under the Noise Control Act of 1972\r\n\n(\"the Noise Act\"), 42 U.S.C.    4901 et seq.  863 F.

That  statute created a federal  regulatory scheme to\r\n\nset  noise  emission levels  for  motor  carriers engaged  in\r\n\ninterstate commerce.  Because the  curfew was imposed in part\r\n\nto eliminate  the noise caused  by trucks,  the truckers  say\r\n\nthat it is preempted by the Noise Act.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\n     The   federal  noise  regulations  pertaining  to  motor\r\n\ncarriers do nothing more than set minimum and maximum decibel\r\n\nlevels  and exhaust  system and  tire standards  for trucking\r\n\nequipment  that may operate on public roadways.  40 C.F.R.   \r\n\n202.20-202.23.    Accordingly,  no  state  or  town  may  set\r\n\ndifferent decibel levels for  motor carriers operating within\r\n\nits jurisdiction.   But neither the Plaistow curfew order nor\r\n\nthe ordinance  it enforces  purports to regulate  the decibel\r\n\nlevels,  exhaust  systems,  or  tires  of individual  trucks.\r\n\nRather, noise levels  were one  element of  an equation  that\r\n\nalso included \"odors, dust, smoke, refuse matter, fumes . . .\r\n\nand vibration\"  and that  prompted a limitation  on operating\r\n\nhours for one specific site.\r\n\n     The Noise Act preemption  clause underscores the limited\r\n\nreach  of  that statute.   It  provides  in relevant  part as\r\n\nfollows:\r\n\n     [A]fter the  effective date of  a regulation  under\r\n     this   section   applicable   to  noise   emissions\r\n     resulting from the  operation of any  motor carrier\r\n     engaged   in  interstate  commerce,   no  State  or\r\n     political  subdivision thereof may adopt or enforce\r\n     any  standard applicable to  the same  operation of\r\n     such   motor  carrier,  unless   such  standard  is\r\n     identical  to  a   standard  applicable  to   noise\r\n     emissions resulting from such  operation prescribed\r\n     by any regulation under this section.\r\n\n42 U.S.C.    4917(c)(1).  Admittedly,  the statutory language\r\n\nis general (\"any standard applicable to the same operation\");\r\n\nbut we think  that it  would stretch the  words beyond  their\r\n\nordinary meaning to strike down a local curfew order based on\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n\na  range  of concerns  where federal  law regulates  only the\r\n\ndecibel  levels  of the  equipment.   The  Noise Act  was not\r\n\ndesigned to remove all state and local control over noise; on\r\n\nthe contrary, the  statute says that  \"primary responsibility\r\n\nfor control of noise rests  with State and local governments.\r\n\n. . .\"  42 U.S.C.   4901(a)(3).\r\n\n     5.   Finally, appellants argue that  the Plaistow curfew\r\n\nis preempted under the Commerce Clause itself even if it does\r\n\nnot offend  any of  the individual  statutes  relied upon  by\r\n\nappellants.   Since Congress has enacted  its own legislative\r\n\ntest  for  this case  (\"reasonable  access\"),  one might  ask\r\n\nwhether it is proper  for the courts to resort  separately to\r\n\nthe  more  general Commerce  Clause  rubrics.   Cf.  White v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMassachusetts  Council of  Construction Employers,  Inc., 460\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S.  204,  213 (1993).    Be that  as  it may,  applying the\r\n\ngeneral Commerce Clause tests does not alter the result.\r\n\n     Absent any statute at all, the courts ask--in a case not\r\n\ninvolving discrimination against interstate commerce--whether\r\n\n\"the  burden [on  interstate  commerce imposed  by the  local\r\n\nrestriction] is clearly excessive in relation to the putative\r\n\nlocal benefits.\"  Pike  v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397  U.S. 137,\r                                                         \r\n\n142  (1970).  The district  court found no  violation in this\r\n\ncase.     Even  if  we  reviewed   this  fact-specific  legal\r\n\ndetermination  de novo, cf. Bose Corp.  v. Consumers Union of\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n\nUnited States, Inc.,  466 U.S.  485, 501 &amp;  n.17 (1984),  our\r                               \r\n\nconclusion would be the same.\r\n\n     Starting with \"burden,\" in this case a night-time curfew\r\n\nprevents  arrivals and  departures  at one  terminal, at  one\r\n\nlocation in the  state, during six late-night  hours (from 11\r\n\np.m.  to 5  a.m.)  with lesser  restrictions for  three hours\r\n\n(from 5 a.m. to 6  a.m. and from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m.).   For 15\r\n\nhours  of  the day  (from 6  a.m. to  9  p.m.), there  are no\r                                                                         \r\n\nlimitations.  The curfew does disadvantage this terminal vis-\r                                                                         \r\n\na-vis other terminals not so restricted, and somewhat impairs\r                 \r\n\nits profits;  but the  magnitude of the  disadvantage is  not\r\n\neasy to isolate.\r\n\n     The  evidence showed  that  customers  often want  early\r\n\nmorning delivery, and in some cases the curfew does limit the\r\n\nability  of  the   Plaistow/Newton  terminal  to  make   such\r\n\ndeliveries.  On the  other hand, there is no  indication that\r\n\ncustomers cannot be served from  other terminals or that  the\r\n\nflow of commerce into  and out of New Hampshire  is seriously\r\n\naffected.   No  state wide  restriction is  involved, compare\r                                                                         \r\n\nKassel  v.  Consolidated  Freightways  Corp.,  450  U.S.  662\r                                                        \r\n\n(1981),  nor   is  a   major  artery  of   commerce  severely\r\n\nconstricted,  compare  Southern Pacific  Co. v.  Arizona, 325\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 761 (1945).\r\n\n     On  the other  side of  the scale,  the impact  on local\r\n\nresidents is  not some  remote or  conjectural specter.   The\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\ncurfew order  was obtained  only because of  local experience\r\n\nwith the terminal; and residents testified at trial about the\r\n\neffect on their lives of unrestricted deliveries.  The curfew\r\n\nis  akin  to zoning  and  traffic restrictions  traditionally\r\n\napplied on a local level, cf. Christensen v. Yolo Cty. Bd. of\r                                                                         \r\n\nSupervisors, 995  F.2d 161,  166 (9th Cir.  1993); Interstate\r                                                                         \r\n\nTowing  Ass'n, Inc. v.

Congress has great latitude  to order preemption,\r\n\nand  calibrate  it with  precision,  based  on a  legislative\r\n\njudgment that local regulation threatens interstate commerce.\r\n\nThe  dormant Commerce Clause, by contrast,  is a fairly blunt\r\n\ninstrument;  and absent discrimination, courts may reasonably\r\n\ninsist on  a  fairly clear  showing  of undue  burden  before\r\n\nholding  unconstitutional  a  traditional  example  of  local\r\n\nregulation.  See Raymond  Motor Transportation, Inc. v. Rice,\r                                                                        \r\n\n434 U.S. 429, 443-44 (1978).

This appeal presents a challenge\r                                      \r\n\nto  a town zoning ordinance  and cease and  desist order that\r\n\nlimit  night-time  access  to   and  from  a  local  trucking\r\n\nterminal.   Appellants are  the terminal owner,  the terminal\r\n\noperator,  various interstate  motor carriers  that regularly\r\n\nuse  the  terminal,  and   an  association  representing  New\r\n\nHampshire truckers.   Appellee is the  Town of Plaistow,  New\r\n\nHampshire, (\"the town\"),  which adopted  the restrictions  at\r\n\nissue.  The terminal is located on a  site partly in Plaistow\r\n\nand partly in Newton, New Hampshire.\r\n\n     The trucking terminal began operation in September 1988.\r\n\nIt serves  as a regional  hub for various  trucking companies\r\n\nserving the New England  area.  Line haulers from  around the\r\n\ncountry drop off freight  to be delivered in New  England and\r\n\npick up  freight whose destination lies  outside New England.\r\n\nAtlas  Motor Express,  Inc.  (\"Atlas\"), the  operator of  the\r\n\nterminal, maintains a fleet of trucks and provides short haul\r\n\nservice within the New  England area.  The terminal  operates\r\n\n24 hours a day, loading and unloading trailers.  \r\n\n     Most trucks that use  the Plaistow/Newton terminal reach\r\n\nit from Interstate  495, a federal highway  that runs through\r\n\nMassachusetts  and  near  the  New Hampshire  border.    From\r\n\nInterstate 495, trucks travel  about 5 miles on Route  125 to\r\n\nKingston  Road (both  are New  Hampshire state  highways) and\r\n\nthen about half a mile to Garland Way, the terminal's private\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\naccess  road.   Trucks  must travel  roughly 2000  feet along\r\n\nGarland  Way, the first  portion of which  passes through the\r\n\nPlaistow residential zone.  The terminal's facilities are all\r\n\nlocated  in  Newton  in   an  industrial  zone  bordering  on\r\n\nPlaistow.\r\n\n     Shortly  after the  terminal opened,  numerous residents\r\n\nfrom  Plaistow who live along  Kingston Road near Garland Way\r\n\ncomplained  about late night  truck traffic  to and  from the\r\n\nterminal.   The town subsequently  served a cease  and desist\r\n\norder on Atlas and  the terminal owner, alleging  a violation\r\n\nof  a  Town  of  Plaistow  zoning  ordinance  that  reads  in\r\n\npertinent part:\r\n\n     Any  uses that  may  be obnoxious  or injurious  by\r\n     reason  of the  production  or emission  of  odors,\r\n     dust, smoke, refuse matter, fumes, noise, vibration\r\n     or  other similar conditions, or that are dangerous\r\n     to the comfort, peace, enjoyment,  health or safety\r\n     of  the community,  whether it  contributes  to its\r\n     disturbance  or  annoyances are  prohibited  in all\r\n     districts.\r\n\nThe  cease and  desist  order stated  that \"heavy  commercial\r\n\ntrucking  arriving  at and  leaving  [the]  site is  emitting\r\n\nodors, smoke,  fumes, noise and vibration  around the clock.\"\r\n\nDespite  the  order, late  night  traffic  to  and  from  the\r\n\nterminal continued.    \r\n\n     The  town  then  brought  an  action  in  New  Hampshire\r\n\nSuperior Court seeking an injunction against the terminal and\r\n\nan order imposing  reasonable hours of operation.   The state\r\n\ncourt entered a preliminary  injunction on February 28, 1989,\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nplacing  a  curfew  on  night-time  access to  and  from  the\r\n\nterminal.   After an evidentiary hearing, the court entered a\r\n\npermanent injunction on July 7, 1989, limiting the terminal's\r\n\nnight-time traffic as follows:\r\n\n     6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.:   No restrictions.\r\n     9:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.:  Two  trucks   may  arrive   or\r\n     depart.\r\n     11:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.:  No   trucks  may   arrive   or\r\n     depart.\r\n     5:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.:   Three  trucks  may  arrive  or\r\n     depart.\r\n\nThe New Hampshire Supreme Court denied the terminal's request\r\n\nfor appellate review.\r\n\n    On  March  26,  1993,  appellants filed  a  federal  suit\r\n\nagainst  the  town,  alleging  that the  enforcement  of  the\r\n\nPlaistow zoning  ordinance was  preempted by  various federal\r\n\nstatutes and by the Commerce Clause.   U.S. Const., Art. I,  \r\n\n8.    On October  25, 1993,  the  district court  granted the\r\n\ntown's motion to dismiss,  for failure to state a  claim, the\r\n\nappellants' claim  that the  injunction was preempted  by the\r\n\nNoise Control  Act of  1972, 42  U.S.C.   4901  et seq.

The terminal is located between five and six miles\r\n\nfrom Interstate  495, the nearest juncture  with the national\r\n\nnetwork.    (Route 125  in  Plaistow  is not  a  part of  the\r\n\nnational  network.    See  23  C.F.R.     658,  app.  A  (New\r                                     \r\n\nHampshire.))   Given this distance, and Plaistow's legitimate\r\n\ninterest in curbing noise,  odor and dust in  its residential\r\n\nareas,  the   district  court   found  that   the  night-time\r\n\nrestrictions were a reasonable compromise. \r\n\n     On  this  appeal,  the   truckers  first  say  that  the\r\n\n\"reasonable  access\" provision  limits state  restrictions to\r\n\nthose  based on safety.

The  \"[p]rohibition on\r\n\ndenying access,\"  49 U.S.C.    31114, extends far  beyond the\r\n\noperation of  interstate highways or  federally funded  state\r\n\nroads  that are  designated  parts of  the national  network.\r\n\nLocal  roads and  other facilities  are also  covered by  the\r\n\nprovision to the extent needed to assure reasonable access to\r\n\nthe national network.  23 C.F.R.    658.19.  The guarantee of\r\n\nreasonable access  thus has a formidable  reach, extending to\r\n\nlocal regulatory  measures that  operate miles away  from any\r\n\ninterstate or national network highway.\r\n\n     Many   of  these  measures  are  designed  to  safeguard\r\n\ninterests  other  than  safety.   Consider,  for  example,  a\r\n\nrestriction  that routed heavy traffic  on a detour  of a few\r\n\nmiles to assure quiet in a hospital zone.  It is difficult to\r\n\nconceive that  Congress meant to exclude such  a concern from\r\n\nthe   calculus  used  to   determine  whether  a  restriction\r\n\ninfringes  on  \"reasonable  access\"  to  the  federal highway\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nsystem.  In this instance, language and policy are  as one in\r\n\nopposing such a restrictive reading.\r\n\n     The  sole  argument  for  limiting  the  restrictions to\r\n\nsafety  matters  stems  from  the  exception  provision,  now\r\n\ncodified as 49 U.S.C.   31114(b).   As a matter of  language,\r\n\nthis  provision  permits, but  does  not  compel, a  negative\r\n\ninference that  the only restrictions allowed  under the main\r\n\nprovision are safety  restrictions.  Because subsections  (a)\r\n\nand  (b) do not  fit neatly together,  it is  difficult to be\r\n\nabsolutely  certain of  Congress'  intent.   But for  several\r\n\nreasons we reject the  suggestion that subsection (b) narrows\r\n\nby inference the concept of reasonableness in subsection (a).\r\n\n     First, the  negative inference is flawed as  a matter of\r\n\nlanguage.   By its terms  the safety exception  in subsection\r\n\n(b) is  concerned not  with safety limitations  generally but\r\n\nwith restrictions on truck  tractor-semitrailer combinations.\r\n\nIf  the  exception  were  taken to  narrow  the  restrictions\r\n\npermitted  under the main \"reasonable access\" provision, then\r\n\narguably  the  only  restrictions  allowed  would  be  safety\r                               \r\n\nrestrictions   directed   to   truck    tractor   semitrailer\r\n\ncombinations, an extremely odd result.\r\n\n     Second,  the  original 1982  Surface  Act  contained the\r\n\nreasonable  access language with  no exception  provision; so\r                                                \r\n\nnothing in 1982 suggested that state access restrictions were\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nlimited  to those based on safety.1   If Congress in 1984 had\r\n\nintended  to alter the  reasonable access provision  so as to\r\n\nlimit the states to safety restrictions, one might reasonably\r\n\nexpect  some indication  of  this  purpose  at least  in  the\r\n\nlegislative history.

Since this  was a\r\n\nconcern to state  officials, S. Rep.

That  statute created a federal  regulatory scheme to\r\n\nset  noise  emission levels  for  motor  carriers engaged  in\r\n\ninterstate commerce.  Because the  curfew was imposed in part\r\n\nto eliminate  the noise caused  by trucks,  the truckers  say\r\n\nthat it is preempted by the Noise Act.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\n     The   federal  noise  regulations  pertaining  to  motor\r\n\ncarriers do nothing more than set minimum and maximum decibel\r\n\nlevels  and exhaust  system and  tire standards  for trucking\r\n\nequipment  that may operate on public roadways.  40 C.F.R.   \r\n\n202.20-202.23.    Accordingly,  no  state  or  town  may  set\r\n\ndifferent decibel levels for  motor carriers operating within\r\n\nits jurisdiction.   But neither the Plaistow curfew order nor\r\n\nthe ordinance  it enforces  purports to regulate  the decibel\r\n\nlevels,  exhaust  systems,  or  tires  of individual  trucks.\r\n\nRather, noise levels  were one  element of  an equation  that\r\n\nalso included \"odors, dust, smoke, refuse matter, fumes . . .\r\n\nand vibration\"  and that  prompted a limitation  on operating\r\n\nhours for one specific site.\r\n\n     The Noise Act preemption  clause underscores the limited\r\n\nreach  of  that statute.   It  provides  in relevant  part as\r\n\nfollows:\r\n\n     [A]fter the  effective date of  a regulation  under\r\n     this   section   applicable   to  noise   emissions\r\n     resulting from the  operation of any  motor carrier\r\n     engaged   in  interstate  commerce,   no  State  or\r\n     political  subdivision thereof may adopt or enforce\r\n     any  standard applicable to  the same  operation of\r\n     such   motor  carrier,  unless   such  standard  is\r\n     identical  to  a   standard  applicable  to   noise\r\n     emissions resulting from such  operation prescribed\r\n     by any regulation under this section.\r\n\n42 U.S.C.    4917(c)(1).  Admittedly,  the statutory language\r\n\nis general (\"any standard applicable to the same operation\");\r\n\nbut we think  that it  would stretch the  words beyond  their\r\n\nordinary meaning to strike down a local curfew order based on\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n\na  range  of concerns  where federal  law regulates  only the\r\n\ndecibel  levels  of the  equipment.   The  Noise Act  was not\r\n\ndesigned to remove all state and local control over noise; on\r\n\nthe contrary, the  statute says that  \"primary responsibility\r\n\nfor control of noise rests  with State and local governments.\r\n\n. . .\"  42 U.S.C.   4901(a)(3).\r\n\n     5.   Finally, appellants argue that  the Plaistow curfew\r\n\nis preempted under the Commerce Clause itself even if it does\r\n\nnot offend  any of  the individual  statutes  relied upon  by\r\n\nappellants.   Since Congress has enacted  its own legislative\r\n\ntest  for  this case  (\"reasonable  access\"),  one might  ask\r\n\nwhether it is proper  for the courts to resort  separately to\r\n\nthe  more  general Commerce  Clause  rubrics.   Cf.  White v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMassachusetts  Council of  Construction Employers,  Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span>\r                                                                    \r\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">204</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  213 (1993).    Be that  as  it may,  applying the\r\n\ngeneral Commerce Clause tests does not alter the result.\r\n\n     Absent any statute at all, the courts ask--in a case not\r\n\ninvolving discrimination against interstate commerce--whether\r\n\n\"the  burden [on  interstate  commerce imposed  by the  local\r\n\nrestriction] is clearly excessive in relation to the putative\r\n\nlocal benefits.\"  Pike  v.
