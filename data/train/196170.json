Consolo (\"Consolo\")  here seeks attorney\r\n\nfees  incurred in defending  a jury verdict in  his favor both on\r\n\nappeal and through a futile petition for certiorari.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          A jury  awarded  Consolo  $90,000  in  damages  against\r\n\nWorcester police  officers Daniel  George (\"George\") and  Michael\r\n\nMulvey  (\"Mulvey\")  for  violations of  Consolo's  civil  rights.\r\n\nGeorge  and  Mulvey appealed  four issues  to  this Court  and we\r\n\naffirmed in all  respects.  Consolo v.  George, 58 F.3d  791 (1st\r                                                        \r\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 520 (1995).\r                             \r\n\n          On  behalf  of  Consolo,  Attorneys  Thomas  C. Cameron\r\n\n(\"Cameron\")  and   Dennis  J.  Curran  (\"Curran\")   filed  a  fee\r\n\napplication (the  \"Application\") for  award of appellate  counsel\r\n\nfees  pursuant to  42  U.S.C.    1988(b).   In  the  Application,\r\n\nConsolo  also  requested  an  award  of  expenses  and  fees  for\r\n\nparalegal Kenneth O'Sullivan (\"O'Sullivan\").   Consolo also filed\r\n\na supplemental  fee application (the  \"Supplemental Application\")\r\n\nfor services related to opposing certiorari.\r\n\n          George and Mulvey's  objections to the  Application and\r\n\nSupplemental Application  fall into six general  categories:  (1)\r\n\nthe  timeliness of Consolo's appeal;  (2) the adequacy of records\r\n\nkept by Cameron and Curran regarding their fees and expenses; (3)\r\n\nwhether work  performed by Cameron  and Curran was  necessary and\r\n\nproductive; (4)  the reasonableness  of rates charged  by Cameron\r\n\nand  Curran;  (5)  whether   work  performed  by  O'Sullivan  was\r\n\nnecessary and productive; and  (6) the reasonableness of expenses\r\r\n\ncharged by Cameron and Curran.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n          Traditionally,  litigants have  borne  their own  legal\r\n\ncosts.  See Alyeska  Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness  Soc'y, 421\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 240, 247 (1975).   Certain statutes and equitable  doctrines\r\n\npermit  departure from  this  tradition.    See  In  re  Thirteen\r                                                                           \r\n\nAppeals, 56 F.3d 295, 304-305  (1st Cir. 1995).  Under  the Civil\r                 \r\n\nRights Attorney's  Fees  Awards Act  of  1976, courts  may  award\r\n\nreasonable  attorney's fees  to  a prevailing  party  in a  civil\r\n\nrights action.  42 U.S.C.   1988(b).  In authorizing such awards,\r\n\nCongress intended to reduce the financial impediments that hinder\r\n\nindividuals from asserting their rights.  Furtado v.  Bishop, 635\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 915, 918-19 (1st Cir. 1980).\r\n\n          Courts  grant attorney's  fees under     1988(b) unless\r\n\nthere  is a  special reason  compelling denial.   Supreme  Ct. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nConsumer's  Union of the United  States, Inc., 446  U.S. 719, 737\r                                                       \r\n\n(1980).   Prevailing plaintiffs  may receive fees  for time spent\r\n\ndefending an  appeal, if the plaintiff  is ultimately successful.\r\n\nSee  Souza  v. Southworth,  564 F.2d  609,  613 (1st  Cir. 1977).\r                                   \r\n\nParties  may also  receive  fees for  time  spent litigating  fee\r\n\napplications.   Lund  v. Affleck,  587 F.2d  75, 77-78  (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1978).\r\n\nA.        Timeliness of Consolo's Application\r          A.        Timeliness of Consolo's Application\r                                                       \r\n\n          George  and  Mulvey  object  to   the  Application  and\r\n\nSupplemental Application,  claiming that both are  untimely.  The\r\n\ngoverning local rule regarding appellate fee applications states:\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n            An application . . . for an award of fees\r\n            and other  expenses . . .  shall be filed\r\n            with the  clerk of  the court  of appeals\r\n            within 30  days of  the date of  entry of\r                                     \r\n            the  final circuit judgment . .  . .  For\r\n            purposes of the 30-day limit,  a judgment\r\n            shall not be  considered final until  the\r\n            time for  filing an appeal or  a petition\r\n            for a writ of certiorari has expired,  or\r\n            judgment is entered by  the court of last\r\n            resort. \r\n\n1st Cir. R. 39.2 (emphasis added).\r\n\n          Consolo filed the  Application on August 8, 1995.   The\r\n\nSupreme Court  denied George  and Mulvey's  Petition for  Writ of\r\n\nCertiorari on November 27, 1995.  Consolo filed the  Supplemental\r\n\nApplication on December 15, 1995.\r\n\n          1.   Supplemental Fee Application\r                    1.   Supplemental Fee Application\r\n\n          George and  Mulvey note  that parties may  petition the\r\n\nSupreme  Court  for  rehearing up  to  25  days  after denial  of\r\n\ncertiorari.  Sup. Ct. R. 44.2.  For purposes of 1st Cir. R. 39.2,\r\n\nGeorge  and  Mulvey contend  that final  judgment does  not occur\r\n\nuntil this 25 day period ends.\r\n\n          However, \"[t]he  order of denial will  not be suspended\r\n\npending disposition  of a  petition  for rehearing  except by  an\r\n\norder of the Court or a Justice.\"  Sup. Ct. R. 16.3.  The Supreme\r\n\nCourt  issued no  such order  in  the instant  case.   Without  a\r\n\ndelaying order, denial  of certiorari is  final judgment for  the\r\n\npurposes of the local rule.  After this final judgment, Consolo's\r\n\nattorneys had 30 days to file an application for attorney's fees.\r\n\n1st  Cir. R. 39.2.   Consolo  met this  requirement by  filing on\r\n\nDecember 15, 1995.  Therefore, Consolo's Supplemental Application\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nis timely under 42 U.S.C.   1988(b) and 1st Cir. R. 39.2.\r\n\n          2.   Fee Application\r                    2.   Fee Application\r\n\n          Rule  39.2  serves three  purposes:    (1) it  promotes\r\n\nfairness  by  requiring  parties  to  apply  for  fees  within  a\r\n\nreasonable  time  after  a  case's resolution;  (2)  it  advances\r\n\njudicial efficiency by reducing of the number of fee applications\r\n\nfiled; and (3) it prevents this Court from issuing awards under  \r\n\n1988(b) inconsistent with subsequent decisions on the case.\r\n\n          George  and  Mulvey  contend  that  Consolo  filed  his\r\n\nApplication prematurely, and that the Court should deny both  the\r\n\nApplication  and  the  Supplementary  Application.2   George  and\r\n\nMulvey argue that we  should interpret 1st  Cir. R. 39.2 to  deny\r\n\napplications filed before final  judgment.  Because Consolo filed\r\n\nhis Application  before the Supreme Court  denied certiorari, the\r\n\nApplication was most certainly premature.  Consolo's Supplemental\r\n\nApplication,  however,  amended  and  expanded  his  Application.\r\n\nThus, even though Consolo's  first application was premature, the\r\n\nSupplemental Application incorporated  and cured the Application.\r\n\nSince the Supplemental  Application is timely  under 1st Cir.  R.\r\n\n39.2, we  must, therefore, examine  the claims presented  in both\r\n\nthe Application and Supplemental Application.\r\n\nB.        Reasonableness of Consolo's Applications\r          B.        Reasonableness of Consolo's Applications\r\n\n          This Court has customarily thought it best to calculate\r\n\nreasonable  fees  through  the  lodestar time  and  rate  method.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  Paradoxically, George and Mulvey also argue in the alternative\r\nthat Consolo's  first application was  late, first  acknowledging\r\nbut then choosing to ignore the plain test of 1st Cir. R. 39.2.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nTennessee Gas Pipeline Co. v. 104 Acres of Land, 32 F.3d 632, 634\r                                                         \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1994); but see In re Thirteen Appeals, 56 F.3d at 305-\r                                                          \r\n\n308  (common fund cases).   The lodestar is  a numerical point of\r\n\nreference  reached  by  multiplying  the total  number  of  hours\r\n\nreasonably  spent by a  reasonable hourly  rate.   Grendel's Den,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc.  v. Larkin,  749  F.2d 945,  950  (1984) (citing  Hensly  v.\r                         \r\n\nEckerhart,  461  U.S. 424,  433-34 [1983]).    The lodestar  is a\r\n\npresumptively  reasonable fee,  but it  is  subject to  upward or\r\n\ndownward  adjustment  for  special  circumstances.    Lipsett  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nBlanco,  975  F.2d  934, 937  (1st  Cir.  1992)  (citing Blum  v.\r                \r\n\nStenson, 465 U.S. 886, 897 [1984]).\r\n\n          1.   Adequacy of record keeping\r                    1.   Adequacy of record keeping\r\n\n          For  the Court  to determine  whether hours  billed are\r\n\nreasonable, applicants  must provide  highly detailed records  of\r\n\ntheir time  expenditures.   Phetosomphone v. Allison  Reed Group,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc., 984 F.2d 4, 7 (1st  Cir. 1993) (citing Grendel's Den, Inc.,\r              \r\n\n749 F.2d  at  952).    The  Court  demands  specific  information\r\n\nregarding  the number  of hours,  dates, and  the nature  of work\r\n\nperformed.  Deary v. City of  Gloucester, 9 F.3d 191, 197-98 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1993) (citing Calhoun v. Acme Cleveland Corp., 801 F.2d 558,\r\n\n560  [1st Cir. 1986]).  Lack of contemporaneous records calls for\r\n\nsubstantial  reduction  or  denial   of  fee  awards,  except  in\r\n\n\"extraordinary  circumstances.\"  Id.    While this  Court has not\r                                              \r\n\ndemanded  inclusion  of the  actual, contemporaneously  kept time\r\n\nsheets or records in  fee applications, their inclusion  aids the\r\n\nCourt  in  more easily  assessing  the  validity, necessity,  and\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nreasonableness of  hours billed.  Applicants fail  to supply such\r\n\nrecords  at  their peril.   See  id.  (noting that  submission of\r                                              \r\n\nactual time slips allowed a trial court to deny 78 of 699.4 hours\r\n\nrequested).\r\n\n          Here,    Consolo's    Application   and    Supplemental\r\n\nApplication   included   affidavits   that    distilled   records\r\n\ncontemporaneously kept  by Cameron, Curran, and  O'Sullivan.  The\r\n\nApplication and  Supplemental Application  did not  include their\r\n\noriginal time  sheets.   Normally an  attorney's account  of time\r\n\nspent must be scrutinized with care.   Calhoun, 801 F.2d at  560;\r                                                        \r\n\nGrendel's  Den, Inc.,  749 F.2d  at 950.   Without  original time\r                              \r\n\nsheets, we hold an applicant's summary of hours spent to an  even\r\n\nhigher level of scrutiny.  Here, we must  use  our own experience\r\n\nand  judgment  to  determine  if  Cameron  and  Curran's  billing\r\n\naccurately reflects  time spent.  We  resolve inconsistencies and\r\n\nambiguities against the applicant.\r\n\n          Before calculating the  lodestar, we  must address  two\r\n\nissues of some concern to this Court.  The first issue relates to\r\n\nthe Application.   On  July 19,  1994, Curran  filed a  Motion to\r\n\nEnlarge Time to  File Brief.   The Motion to  Enlarge would  have\r\n\nextended  the deadline  to  file Consolo's  Appellate Brief  from\r\n\nJuly 14,  1994  to July  21, 1994.   In  that Motion  to Enlarge,\r\n\nCurran represented that Consolo's attorneys needed the additional\r\n\ntime \"to  proofread the  Brief, review transcript  references and\r\n\nreproduce trial exhibits for this appeal.\"   Plaintiff-Appellee's\r\n\nMotion to Enlarge Time  to File Brief at   2.   The Court granted\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nthis  Motion on  July 21,  1994, so  counsel could  perform these\r\n\nclerical tasks.  In the Application, Curran and Cameron requested\r\n\nreimbursement  for  work performed  during this  additional week.\r\n\nSome of the work  claimed during this period is  unrelated to the\r\n\nlimited, clerical tasks described in the Motion to Enlarge.3\r\n\n          Poor  record keeping  by  Cameron and  Curran may  have\r\n\nresulted    in   inaccurate    billing   during    this   period.\r\n\nAlternatively, Curran may have misrepresented the reasons for his\r\n\nMotion  to  Enlarge Time.    In either  case,  the  Court is  not\r\n\ndisposed to grant attorney's fees for these inconsistencies.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nBrewster v. Dukakis, 3 F.3d 488, 494  n.6 (1st Cir. 1993) (noting\r                             \r\n\nthat courts can and should deny recovery for such \"sloppy\" record\r\n\nkeeping).      Unfortunately,  Consolo's   application   did  not\r\n\nadequately distinguish  between time spent on clerical (permitted\r\n\nunder the  Motion to Enlarge)  and non-clerical tasks.4   Because\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3  Work  that falls outside of  Consolo's Motion to Enlarge  Time\r\nincludes:\r\n\n     July 15, 1994     \"[B]egin drafting Statement of Facts.\"\r\n     July 18, 1994     \"Revise Statement of Facts.\"\r\n     July 19, 1994     \"[R]evise Statement of Facts for Brief.\"\r\n\n4    This  is  the  source  of  much  difficulty  concerning  the\r\nApplication  and  Supplemental Application.   Cameron  and Curran\r\nprovided the number of hours spent on Consolo's case per day, and\r\nroughly the subject matter or task on which they spent this time.\r\nWhile they did divide the number of hours spent by attorney, they\r\ndid not divide the number of  hours by task.  For example, Curran\r\nclaims he spent 5.05 hours on July 14, 1994, \"continu[ing] review\r\nof  ten volumes of trial transcript to prepare [the] Statement of\r\nFacts  for  Brief;  [and  in] telephone  conferences  with  [the]\r\nClerk's  Office and  with [defense  counsel].\"   This forces  the\r\nCourt to  guess  how much  time  Curran spent  in review  of  the\r\nvolumes  and  how  much   was  spent  in  telephone  conferences.\r\nApplicants  should   consider  detail  almost   as  important  as\r\nconscientious and accurate reporting.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nwe  are  unable  to  distinguish  these  time  periods,  any work\r\n\nperformed inconsistent with the Motion  to Enlarge will result in\r\n\ndenial of  award  for that  day.    Thus, we  will  not  consider\r\n\nCurran's  application for 10.3 hours  on July 15  and 19, 1994 in\r\n\nour calculation  of  the lodestar.    Similarly, we  will  ignore\r\n\nCameron's application for 1.3 hours on July 18, 1994.\r\n\n          The   second  issue   relates   to   the   Supplemental\r\n\nApplication; it  contains  disturbingly similar  inaccuracies  as\r\n\nthose discussed above.   Under oath, Curran stated that  he spent\r\n\none  hour making  revisions to  the Supplemental  Application and\r\n\nsupporting materials drafted by Cameron.  Yet, Curran requests .9\r                                                 \r\n\nhours   for  his  own  work  spent   to  draft  the  Supplemental\r\n\nApplication.  He also  claims a separate .8  hours to revise  the\r\n\nSupplemental  Application.   We  demand  the  strictest level  of\r\n\naccuracy, honesty,  and good faith in applications for fees under\r\n\n  1988(b).   The Court  will deny  any section of  an application\r\n\ncontaining   inaccurate  statements;   we  will   similarly  deny\r\n\napplications that are knowingly incorrect.  Thus we deny .9 hours\r\n\nfrom  calculation  of  the  lodestar  in  Consolo's  Supplemental\r\n\nApplication.\r\n\n          2.   Necessity of work performed by Consolo's attorneys\r                    2.   Necessity of work performed by Consolo's attorneys\r\n\n          Defendants strenuously object to  Consolo's application\r\n\nfor fees regarding preparation for, and attendance  at, two Civil\r\n\nAppeal Management  Program pre-argument conferences  (the \"Appeal\r\n\nConferences\").  Both Cameron and Curran attended these two Appeal\r\n\nConferences.   The  Court requires  these conferences  to promote\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\njudicial efficiency.   We give  notice that the  Court demands  a\r\n\nhigh  degree of  comprehension of  the legal  and factual  issues\r\n\npresented.  Thus, this Court will award fees for preparation for,\r\n\nand attendance at, the Appeal Conferences.  However,   1988(b) is\r\n\nnot a full  employment program.   Where one  attorney would  have\r\n\nbeen  sufficient,   1988(b) will  not allow recovery  of fees for\r\n\nthe work  of two; the Court will discount the work of superfluous\r\n\nattorneys.   Hart v. Bourque, 798  F.2d 519, 523 (1st  Cir. 1986)\r                                      \r\n\n(citing  King v. Greenblatt, 560 F.2d 1024, 1027 [1st Cir. 1977],\r\n\ncert.  denied, 438  U.S. 916 [1978]).   Courts  should ordinarily\r                       \r\n\ngreet a claim  that several  lawyers were required  to perform  a\r\n\nsingle  set of tasks with  healthy skepticism.   Pearson v. Fair,\r                                                                          \r\n\n980 F.2d  37, 47  (1st Cir.  1992) (internal citations  omitted).\r\n\nSimilarly, we should not shift  fees for time spent in review  of\r\n\nanother attorney's research.   Hart,  798 F.2d at  522-23.   This\r                                             \r\n\nCourt will only  include the work  of one attorney's  preparation\r\n\nand appearance  for the  Appeal Conferences when  calculating the\r\n\nnumber  of \"reasonable hours\" for the lodestar.  Since it appears\r\n\nthat Curran performed the great majority of the preparatory  work\r\n\nfor these conferences, we find that his work was reasonable under\r\n\nHart  and Pearson.    Therefore, when  calculating the  number of\r                           \r\n\nreasonable hours for the lodestar, we will not include 2 hours on\r\n\nMarch 30, 1994, and .75 hours on May 12, 1994, claimed by Cameron\r\n\nin conjunction with the Appeal Conferences.\r\n\n          George  and Mulvey object  to the Application regarding\r\n\nwork performed in  preparation for oral argument.   While Cameron\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\npresented oral  argument, Curran  provided research.   George and\r\n\nMulvey would  limit Consolo's  recovery for  this overlap.   Such\r\n\nlimitations are  appropriate where  there is redundancy  in legal\r\n\nwork.   Hart,  798 F.2d at  523.   At best,  Curran and Cameron's\r                      \r\n\narrangement  was an inefficient  use of resources.   For example,\r\n\nwhile Cameron's  attendance would  have  been sufficient,  Curran\r\n\njoined his  co-counsel in conferences with  consultants.  Section\r\n\n1988(b) does not  compel recovery  for waste.5   This Court  will\r\n\nconsider  only  one  attorney's  work in  research  of  the  oral\r\n\nargument toward the  number of \"reasonable  hours spent\" for  the\r\n\nlodestar.  Therefore, we deduct 7.6 hours from our calculation of\r\n\nreasonable hours spent.6\r\n\n          We do,  however, allow  recovery of  the fees for  both\r\n\nattorneys'  attendance at  the appellate  hearing, as  Curran was\r\n\npresent to answer any  factual questions regarding the trial  and\r\n\nCameron  argued the substantive issues of law.  Courts should not\r\n\nread  the requirements  of \"reasonable  hours expended\"  to limit\r\n\ntheir own factfinding process.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5   The attendance of two attorneys  at the Appeal Conferences is\r\nnot   per   se  superfluous.     However,   given  the   lack  of\r                        \r\ncontemporaneous    time    records    and    the    application's\r\ninconsistencies,  Consolo's application fails  to meet its burden\r\nof proof for this expense.\r\n\n   Similarly, we do not  hold as matter  of law that Cameron  and\r\nCurran's  research arrangement was duplicative.  Nevertheless, in\r\nthis instance we  find that  Consolo has failed  to justify  this\r\nexpense.\r\n\n6  We deduct 1.1 hours for work on August 25, 1994; 1.8 hours for\r\nwork  on September  6, 1994;  .7 hours for  work on  September 7,\r\n1994; and 4.0 hours for work on September 8, 1994.\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n          3.

Reasonable fees per hour\r\n\n          The  fee per  hour for  work on  the litigation  is the\r\n\n\"core  rate.\"  Brewster,  3 F.3d at  492 n.4.   Applicants should\r                                 \r\n\nbill other work, including  work on the application itself,  at a\r\n\nreduced \"non-core  rate.\"  Id.   A reasonable hourly rate  is the\r                                        \r\n\nprevailing  market  rate  in  the relevant  legal  community  for\r\n\nsimilar  services  by  lawyers of  reasonably  comparable skills.\r\n\nBlum v.  Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895 &amp; n.11.  \"Absent more unusual\r                          \r\n\ncircumstances .  . . the  fee rates of  the local area  should be\r\n\napplied  even  when the  lawyers  seeking fees  are  from another\r\n\narea.\"    Ramos v.  Lamm,  713 F.2d  546, 555  (10th  Cir. 1983).\r                                  \r\n\nConsolo contends that the relevant legal market is  Boston, where\r\n\nthis  Court  heard the  appeal.   Consolo  provided  an affidavit\r\n\ndeclaring that $175 per hour is a reasonable fee for such work in\r\n\nBoston.    George  and  Mulvey  claim  that  the  relevant  legal\r\n\ncommunity is Worcester,  where the incidents  giving rise to  the\r\n\nclaim  occurred.  George and Mulvey provide no evidence regarding\r\n\nBoston area  fees, but  provide an  affidavit declaring  that the\r\n\nrelevant per hour  fee in Worcester is $150.   Here, the district\r\n\njudge  allowed Consolo's request for $175 per hour for trial work\r\n\nin Worcester.  We defer to  the determination by the trial  judge\r\n\nand consider $175 the \"core rate,\" a  reasonable fee per hour for\r\n\npurposes of the lodestar.7\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7   Because  the  trial  court  concluded  that  $175/hr.  was  a\r\nreasonable  fee  in Worcester  and George  and Mulvey  admit that\r\n$175/hr.  was a  reasonable  fee  in  Boston,  we  need  make  no\r\ndetermination  as to  whether the  trial  court or  the appellate\r\ncourt's legal community is used in calculation of the lodestar.\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\n          Consolo also  applied for fees in  conjunction with the\r\n\ncreation of  the fee  applications themselves.   \"Time reasonably\r\n\nexpended  in connection with a fee application is compensable . .\r\n\n. but it may be fairly compensated at a reduced rate.\"  Brewster,\r                                                                          \r\n\n3  F.3d at 494  (internal citations  omitted).   Applicants often\r\n\nspend  such  time  doing  little  more  than  documenting  action\r\n\npreviously taken.   Id.  In  this case, we  will allow \"non-core\"\r                                 \r\n\nwork such as this at one-half the \"core rate.\"  Thus, the fee per\r\n\nhour for work on the  Application and Supplemental Application is\r\n\n$87.50.\r\n\n          4.   Lodestar calculation\r                    4.   Lodestar calculation\r\n\n          Consolo applied  for a total  of 157.9 hours  under the\r\n\nApplication.   This Court denied  11.3 hours from the calculation\r\n\nof  the   lodestar  for  the  obvious   inconsistencies  in  that\r\n\napplication.   As noted above, this Court also denied 10.35 hours\r\n\nwithin  the lodestar,  as  these hours  represent unnecessary  or\r\n\nredundant  work.  Thus, this Court  finds that 136.25 hours was a\r\n\n\"reasonable  number of hours\" for  purposes of the  lodestar.  Of\r\n\nthe 136.25 hours,  116.05 hours  are billed at  the \"core  rate,\"\r\n\n$175  per hour, for appellate  related work.   The remaining 20.2\r\n\nhours are billed  at $87.50 per hour,  half the \"core  rate,\" for\r\n\napplication related work.   Therefore, Consolo's lodestar for his\r\n\nApplication is $22,076.25.8\r\n\n          Under the Supplemental  Application, Consolo seeks fees\r\n\nfor 41.1 hours.  Of these, Cameron and Curran spent 29.7 hours on\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8  (116.05 x $175) + (20.2 x $87.50).\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\ncertiorari-related activities; recovery for these hours is at the\r\n\n\"core rate\" of $175.  Cameron and Curran spent the remaining 11.4\r\n\nhours  either   on  Consolo's  rebuttal  memorandum   or  on  the\r\n\nsupplemental fee application.   This Court  denied .9 hours  from\r\n\ncalculation  of the  lodestar,  due to  inconsistencies regarding\r\n\ntime spent  on the Supplemental  Application.  We  compensate the\r\n\nremaining  10.5   at  one-half   of  the  \"core   rate,\"  $87.50.\r\n\nTherefore, Consolo's lodestar for the Supplemental Application is\r\n\n$6,116.25.9  Consolo's total lodestar is $28,192.50.10\r\n\n          5.   Special factors\r                    5.   Special factors\r\n\n          Courts may  depart from the lodestar  to compensate for\r\n\n\"special  circumstances.\"  Lipsett, 975  F.2d at 937.   Here, the\r                                            \r\n\nCourt  addressed the concerns of  both parties when it calculated\r\n\nthe lodestar.  We, therefore,  find no reason to depart from  the\r\n\nlodestar in  awarding appellate  and certiorari  fees.   We  must\r\n\nsatisfy ourselves  of the overall fairness  and reasonableness of\r\n\nthe  fee under these particular circumstances.

We will also deny recovery\r                             \r\n\nfor unnecessary  paralegal work.  O'Sullivan's  attendance at the\r\n\nconferences and  the hearing was  unnecessary; we will  not shift\r\n\nthis expense to George and Mulvey.  Thus we deny recovery for 5.4\r\n\nhours of O'Sullivan's claim.\r\n\n          \"Purely  clerical or  secretarial  tasks should  not be\r\n\nbilled at  a paralegal  rate, regardless  of who performs  them.\"\r\n\nJenkins, 491 U.S. at 288 n.10.

George and  Mulvey did not  contest the $35  per hour\r\n\nrate claimed by  O'Sullivan.   Thus, we adopt  this as the  \"core\r\n\nrate\" for O'Sullivan's  lodestar.   We see no  reason to  deviate\r\n\nfrom  the  lodestar  in   this  case  as  we  find   no  \"special\r\n\ncircumstances\" that merit an increase or decrease.

He also  claimed  $427.71 in  the Supplemental\r\n\nApplication for certiorari-related expenses.\r\n\n          We  will not  shift the  cost of  long-term investments\r\n\nmade  during litigation.    Included in  his Application,  Curran\r\n\nrequests $117.91 for a police misconduct litigation treatise.  We\r\n\ndo  not question the usefulness of  this text; however, attorneys\r\n\nshould  make  a good  faith  effort to  minimize  expenses before\r\n\nfiling for  fees under   1988(b).   We find no  such effort here.\r\n\nCertainly, Consolo's attorneys could  have borrowed the text from\r\n\na library for a significantly smaller sum.   Thus we deny payment\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n12  28.05 x $35.00.\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nfor this expense.\r\n\n          George  and   Mulvey  objected  to  expenses   for  the\r\n\ntranscript  of  the Defendant's  closing  argument.   George  and\r\n\nMulvey  claim that Consolo never used the transcript, and thus we\r\n\nshould  not shift  its cost.   We  think it  is inappropriate  to\r\n\ncross-reference expenses to the text of an Appellant's Brief when\r\n\nawarding fees.  It is likely that Cameron and Curran investigated\r\n\na  course of argument they  later deemed unworthy.   Denying such\r\n\nresearch  is contrary  to the purpose  of    1988(b).   Thus, the\r\n\nCourt  grants Consolo's request for $84 for the transcript of the\r\n\nclosing argument.\r\n\n          George  and Mulvey also contest the use of a courier to\r\n\nsend Consolo's appellate  brief to the Defendants' counsel.  This\r\n\nservice cost $14.   Consolo appears to have retained  the courier\r\n\nin  good faith; it was a reasonable attempt to provide George and\r\n\nMulvey  with a copy of the brief.   Thus we grant the request for\r\n\n$14.\r\n\n          Consolo  requests  $54.15   in  photocopy  and  library\r\n\nexpenses.    Parties  may  recover  such  reasonable  expenses.13\r\n\nSee, e.g., Northcross, 611 F.2d at 639.  George and Mulvey do not\r                               \r\n\nobject; thus this  expense is granted.  George and Mulvey also do\r\n\nnot object to a $8.39 expense for a videotape; this is granted.\r\n\n          The remaining $26.27 in  the Application was an expense\r\n\nConsolo  should  have  obtained   under  Fed.  R.  App.  P.   39.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n13  Counsel billed  $3.20 of Consolo's fee application  for costs\r\nto \"misc.\" and not to Consolo.  We do not consider this amount in\r\nour calculations.\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nApplicants should  not seek  such costs under  the aegis  of a   \r\n\n1988(b) action.   Therefore, we  grant $143.40 in  expenses under\r\n\nthe Application.14\r\n\n          In  the  Supplemental Application,  Consolo  included a\r\n\nbill  from a  legal publisher  clearly identifying  necessary and\r\n\nreasonable expenses  related to  certiorari.   While  we have  no\r\n\nrecord of payment, bills such as these are rebuttable evidence of\r\n\nan expense.   We presume  that Cameron  and Curran will  pay this\r\n\nbill.   If George and Mulvey had demonstrated otherwise, we would\r\n\nnot  have shifted  this  expense.   Thus,  we grant  $327.71  for\r\n\nreproduction  and  service  of  Consolo's  Brief  in  Opposition.\r\n\nFinally, Cameron  requests $100 reimbursement  for admission fees\r\n\nto the bar of the Supreme Court.  George and Mulvey do not object\r\n\nto this expense; it is thus granted.\r\n\nC.        Conclusion\r          C.        Conclusion\r\n\n          In total,  this court awards $29,745.36  to Consolo for\r\n\nappellate and certiorari attorney's fees and costs pursuant to 42\r\n\nU.S.C.   1988(b) and 1st Cir.

Consolo (\"Consolo\") on the ground that the two officers violated Consolo's civil rights through deliberate indifference to his medical needs after taking him into custody.  In view of the jury's verdict, we state the facts of record in the light most favorable to Consolo.  See Aetna Casualty Surety Co. v. P &amp; B Autobody, 43 F.3d 1546, 1552 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 9, 1990, Consolo was driving in his pickup truck--admittedly intoxicated--when one of his tires went flat.  Consolo kept going and, when spotted by Officer George, was driving on the rim which was emitting sparks.  Officer George stopped Consolo but, when questioned, Consolo swore at him and drove off, attempting to escape.  Officer George then called for back-up and five officers, in separate vehicles, responded, chasing Consolo for approximately 1.3 miles.  Finally, his escape blocked by a police cruiser across the road, Consolo stopped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, the testimony diverges sharply.  Consolo claims he was dragged from his pickup truck and stomped, kicked, and beaten while he lay helpless on the ground in unbearable pain from three separate fractures to his pelvis occasioned, he says, from his beating.  The police witnesses took a different tack, testifying that Consolo had leapt from his pickup truck as soon as it came to a halt and that Officer George used only such force as was necessary to subdue and handcuff Consolo at which point Officer Mulvey and other police officers arrived.  Consolo was then taken to police headquarters, booked, and ultimately brought to the hospital to receive medical treatment for what, it is undisputed, was a fractured pelvis.  In closing, defense counsel argued that the medical evidence of the fracture was explained by Consolo's frantic leap from his pickup truck in an attempt to escape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court and counsel had partially winnowed Consolo's federal and state claims against the two officers and the City of Worcester (\"City\"), the case was submitted to the jury on special interrogatories.  The jury ultimately found for the defendants on each of the questions submitted, save only that it found that both Officers George and Mulvey had \"exhibit[ed] deliberate indifference to Joseph Consolo's medical needs after his arrest\" and assessed $90,000 damages for such failure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officers George and Mulvey raise four issues on appeal.  We deal with each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. The Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Balked of complete vindication on but a single count, Officers George and Mulvey scrutinize the trial record with care, now focusing on the district court's explanation of the concept of \"deliberate indifference\" in the jury instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>Now, the term \"deliberate indifference.\"   Plaintiff also claims that he was denied adequate medical care after his arrest.  Deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners violates the constitutional right of due process of law.  Deliberate indifference is more than a showing of negligence.  Rather, it has been described as gross negligence or reckless disregard.  The idea of deliberate indifference might be expressed in two ways.  One is to disregard intentionally and deliberately the duty to act in a certain way, and the other is to be intentionally and deliberately indifferent to whether or not there is a duty and to whether or not some action is needed to perform that duty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>Thus, if you find that the defendants were aware that plaintiff was seriously in need of medical attention and failed to provide access to medical personnel or intentionally delayed such access, or if you find that defendants intentionally failed to cooperate with medical personnel who did see the plaintiff, then you should find that the defendants are liable for a violation of plaintiff's constitutional rights in that regard.  Although mere negligent or inadvertent inattention to plaintiff's medical needs does not amount to a violation of his constitutional rights, if you find that the defendants deliberately assumed a posture of indifference to his medical needs, you must find them liable for a violation of his constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Tr. 8-127, 128) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No one objected to these instructions at trial.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 (requiring a party who believes jury instruction to be erroneous to object before the jury retires to consider the verdict).  Generally, an objection to jury instructions not made at trial as required by Rule 51 cannot be raised successfully on appeal.  Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys. Inc., 54 F.3d 931, 940-41 (1st Cir.1995) (describing this Rule as the \"use it or lose it\" principle).  Accordingly, we may disturb the jury's verdict here only if the challenged instruction constituted plain error.  See Transnational Corp. v. Rodio &amp; Ursillo, Ltd., 920 F.2d 1066, 1069 (1st Cir.1990).  Plain error is a very high standard, and will be found only when the court's erroneous instructions \"result[ ] in a 'clear miscarriage of justice' or 'seriously affect[ ] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.' \"  Id. (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officers George and Mulvey nevertheless claim that the jury instructions were fatally flawed.  They point to the First Circuit's opinion in Manarite v. City of Springfield, in which this Court defined \"deliberate indifference\" as \"more than ordinary negligence, and probably more than gross negligence.\"  957 F.2d 953, 956 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 113, 121 L.Ed.2d 70 (1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The officers argue that by equating the concept of \"deliberate indifference\" with \"gross negligence,\" the district judge so diluted the standard of proof as to constitute plain error.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Manarite, a jail suicide case, this Court explained that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>when liability for serious harm ... is at issue, a plaintiff must demonstrate \"deliberate indifference\" by showing (1) an unusually serious risk of harm ... (2) defendant's actual knowledge of (or, at least, willful blindness to) that elevated risk, and (3) defendant's failure to take obvious steps to address that known, serious risk.  The risk, the knowledge, and the failure to do the obvious, taken together must show that the defendant is \"deliberately indifferent\" to the harm that follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">957 F.2d at 956.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court's single reference to the concept of gross negligence here, however, did not seriously affect the integrity of this proceeding.  Though mentioning the concept \"gross negligence\" together with recklessness in its general definition, the court went on at once to instruct the jury that to find deliberate indifference it had to find that the police officers were aware \"that plaintiff was seriously in need of medical attention\" and, further, that the police officers \"deliberately assumed a posture of indifference to [Consolo's] medical needs,\" or \"intentionally failed to cooperate with medical personnel.\"  (Tr. 8-128)  Taken in context, and considered in light of the entire charge, these instructions adequately conveyed to the jury the analytic elements that are the necessary predicate to concluding that either Officer George or Officer Mulvey had acted with such recklessness as to constitute deliberate indifference.  While we disapprove of the reference to \"gross negligence\" in this context, there is here no plain error given the careful and detailed particularity of the jury instructions in their entirety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>2. Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The district court may grant a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict only after a determination that the evidence could lead a reasonable person to only one conclusion, namely, that the moving party was entitled to judgment.\"  Hendricks &amp; Assocs. v. Daewoo Corp., 923 F.2d 209, 214 (1st Cir.1991) (citations and internal quotations omitted).  \"Appellate review of a denial of judgment n.o.v. is governed by the same stringent rules as those that apply to the district court.\"  Nydam v. Lennerton, 948 F.2d 808, 810 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officers George and Mulvey advance two arguments in their attempt to demonstrate that the district court was required to grant their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  First, they argue, no reasonable jury could have concluded from the evidence at trial that the delay in affording Consolo medical care proximately caused his injuries to worsen.  George and Mulvey unfortunately focus their argument too narrowly.  Here the jury could well have based its decision not only upon a finding that the officers' deliberate indifference caused Consolo's medical condition to worsen, but also upon a finding that their deliberate indifference left him in pain and suffering for a longer period than would otherwise have been the case had he been afforded prompt medical attention.  The booking video, introduced as evidence at trial, shows Consolo in excruciating pain, barely standing even with assistance.  In fact, for the first few minutes of the video, Consolo is lying on the floor unable to get up.  In light of this evidence, the jury could reasonably conclude that the delay in providing Consolo medical treatment entitled him to damages for pain and suffering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Officers George and Mulvey argue that as matter of law they were entitled to qualified immunity in the circumstances presented at trial<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and thus are entitled to judgment n.o.v.  \"[The] operative inquiry on qualified immunity is not whether the defendants actually abridged the plaintiffs' constitutional rights, but whether the defendants' conduct was objectively reasonable, given the constitutional understandings then current.\"  Crooker v. Metallo, 5 F.3d 583, 585 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the constitutional standard is clear.  Since at least 1983 there has been no doubt that a pre-trial detainee is entitled to medical attention for serious medical needs under the due process clause of the Constitution.  See City of Revere v. Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., 463 U.S. 239, 244, 103 S.Ct. 2979, 2983-84, 77 L.Ed.2d 605 (1983).  Applying this legal standard to the record before the district judge, there was ample evidence that, given Consolo's condition at the time he entered the police station, the officers acted unreasonably in not seeking medical treatment for him before bringing him to the booking room.  Accordingly, the district court properly denied the claim of qualified immunity and submitted the issue to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Motions for a New Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officers George and Mulvey urge reversal of the decision of the district court to deny their motions for a new trial.  \"A district court should order a new trial only when convinced that the clear weight of the evidence so requires, or that a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.\"  Veranda Beach Club Ltd. v. Western Sur. Co., 936 F.2d 1364, 1384 (1st Cir.1991).  We will reverse the decision of a district court upon such a motion only where there has been an abuse of discretion.  There was no abuse of discretion here.  At bottom, the arguments of the police officers on this aspect of the case depend entirely upon their assessment as to the credibility of the evidence.  Having already concluded that the evidence was sufficient to warrant the jury's verdict, the jurors' assessment of credibility is conclusive and the decision of the district court to deny the motion for a new trial was well within its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4. Remittitur</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Officers George and Mulvey argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying their motion for remittitur.  When the jury first returned to the courtroom with its verdict, it found that Officers George and Mulvey were deliberately indifferent to Consolo's medical needs, that the City (but neither Officers George nor Mulvey) was grossly negligent on a pendant state claim, and awarded Consolo $90,000.  The district court pointed out to the jury that the finding against the City on the state claim was inconsistent with its findings for Officers George and Mulvey on that point, as the City could there be liable only upon a theory of vicarious liability, and the jury had not found the police officers liable.  The jury was instructed to continue its deliberations and, when it returned a verdict the second time, it had eliminated any finding against the City but retained its award to Consolo of $90,000 against Officers George and Mulvey for deliberate indifference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officers George and Mulvey now claim that the only way justly to construe the jury's verdict is to conclude that, because the City was somehow found a proximate cause of the damage to Consolo in the jury's first return, the award of $90,000 to him cannot stand as this sum remained consistent in both the first and second verdicts.  There is nothing to this argument.  It reduces to the claim that, because the City was let off, the damages should be reduced.  But whatever the basis for liability, here Consolo's damages were the same and each defendant, if liable at all, is liable jointly and severally for full damages.  As the verdict was entirely consistent with the evidence, the assessment of damages cannot be disturbed unless the award exceeded \"any rational appraisal or estimate of the damages that could be based upon the evidence\" or was \"grossly excessive,\" \"inordinate,\" \"shocking to the conscious of the court,\" or \"so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.\"  Segal v. Gilbert Color Systems, Inc., 746 F.2d 78, 81 (1st Cir.1984), quoting Grunenthal v. Long Island R.R. Co., 393 U.S. 156, 159 n. 4, 89 S.Ct. 331, 333 &amp; n. 4, 21 L.Ed.2d 309 (1968).  No remittitur was required here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arguments of Officer George and Officer Mulvey having been tried and found wanting, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Officers Mulvey and George argue that the decision of the Supreme Court in Farmer v. Brennan, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1970-81, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994), decided after the trial at issue here, bolsters their position.  In Farmer, the Supreme Court adopted a subjective test for evaluating deliberate indifference in the Eighth Amendment context.  The present case arises in the context of the due process clause under the Fourteenth Amendment.  In view of the \"plain error\" analysis in the text, we decline to engage in an analysis of Farmer in these premises</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> No appeal has been taken from the denial of the pre-trial motion to dismiss on the ground of qualified immunity.  This is hardly surprising given the allegations of excessive force by the police.  The jury having rejected these allegations as unproven, George and Mulvey now focus on the deliberate indifference claim to which the jury gave credence</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Consolo (\"Consolo\") on the ground that the two officers violated Consolo's civil rights through deliberate indifference to his medical needs after taking him into custody.  In view of the jury's verdict, we state the facts of record in the light most favorable to Consolo.  See Aetna Casualty Surety Co. v. P &amp; B Autobody, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686425\"><a href=\"/opinion/686425/aetna-casualty-surety-company-v-p-b-autobody-arsenal-auto-repairs/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1546</span></a></span>, 1552 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 9, 1990, Consolo was driving in his pickup truck--admittedly intoxicated--when one of his tires went flat.  Consolo kept going and, when spotted by Officer George, was driving on the rim which was emitting sparks.  Officer George stopped Consolo but, when questioned, Consolo swore at him and drove off, attempting to escape.  Officer George then called for back-up and five officers, in separate vehicles, responded, chasing Consolo for approximately 1.3 miles.  Finally, his escape blocked by a police cruiser across the road, Consolo stopped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, the testimony diverges sharply.  Consolo claims he was dragged from his pickup truck and stomped, kicked, and beaten while he lay helpless on the ground in unbearable pain from three separate fractures to his pelvis occasioned, he says, from his beating.  The police witnesses took a different tack, testifying that Consolo had leapt from his pickup truck as soon as it came to a halt and that Officer George used only such force as was necessary to subdue and handcuff Consolo at which point Officer Mulvey and other police officers arrived.  Consolo was then taken to police headquarters, booked, and ultimately brought to the hospital to receive medical treatment for what, it is undisputed, was a fractured pelvis.  In closing, defense counsel argued that the medical evidence of the fracture was explained by Consolo's frantic leap from his pickup truck in an attempt to escape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court and counsel had partially winnowed Consolo's federal and state claims against the two officers and the City of Worcester (\"City\"), the case was submitted to the jury on special interrogatories.  The jury ultimately found for the defendants on each of the questions submitted, save only that it found that both Officers George and Mulvey had \"exhibit[ed] deliberate indifference to Joseph Consolo's medical needs after his arrest\" and assessed $90,000 damages for such failure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officers George and Mulvey raise four issues on appeal.  We deal with each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. The Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Balked of complete vindication on but a single count, Officers George and Mulvey scrutinize the trial record with care, now focusing on the district court's explanation of the concept of \"deliberate indifference\" in the jury instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>Now, the term \"deliberate indifference.\"   Plaintiff also claims that he was denied adequate medical care after his arrest.  Deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners violates the constitutional right of due process of law.  Deliberate indifference is more than a showing of negligence.  Rather, it has been described as gross negligence or reckless disregard.  The idea of deliberate indifference might be expressed in two ways.  One is to disregard intentionally and deliberately the duty to act in a certain way, and the other is to be intentionally and deliberately indifferent to whether or not there is a duty and to whether or not some action is needed to perform that duty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>Thus, if you find that the defendants were aware that plaintiff was seriously in need of medical attention and failed to provide access to medical personnel or intentionally delayed such access, or if you find that defendants intentionally failed to cooperate with medical personnel who did see the plaintiff, then you should find that the defendants are liable for a violation of plaintiff's constitutional rights in that regard.  Although mere negligent or inadvertent inattention to plaintiff's medical needs does not amount to a violation of his constitutional rights, if you find that the defendants deliberately assumed a posture of indifference to his medical needs, you must find them liable for a violation of his constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Tr. 8-127, 128) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No one objected to these instructions at trial.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 (requiring a party who believes jury instruction to be erroneous to object before the jury retires to consider the verdict).  Generally, an objection to jury instructions not made at trial as required by Rule 51 cannot be raised successfully on appeal.  Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys.

Accordingly, we may disturb the jury's verdict here only if the challenged instruction constituted plain error.  See Transnational Corp. v.

Plain error is a very high standard, and will be found only when the court's erroneous instructions \"result[ ] in a 'clear miscarriage of justice' or 'seriously affect[ ] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.' \"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552772\"><a href=\"/opinion/552772/transnational-corp-v-rodio-ursillo-ltd-etc/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (citations omitted).</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officers George and Mulvey nevertheless claim that the jury instructions were fatally flawed.  They point to the First Circuit's opinion in Manarite v. City of Springfield, in which this Court defined \"deliberate indifference\" as \"more than ordinary negligence, and probably more than gross negligence.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578608\"><a href=\"/opinion/578608/jessica-a-manarite-by-and-through-her-next-friend-carla-manarite-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">953</span></a></span>, 956 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

(2) defendant's actual knowledge of (or, at least, willful blindness to) that elevated risk, and (3) defendant's failure to take obvious steps to address that known, serious risk.  The risk, the knowledge, and the failure to do the obvious, taken together must show that the defendant is \"deliberately indifferent\" to the harm that follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">957 F.2d at 956.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court's single reference to the concept of gross negligence here, however, did not seriously affect the integrity of this proceeding.  Though mentioning the concept \"gross negligence\" together with recklessness in its general definition, the court went on at once to instruct the jury that to find deliberate indifference it had to find that the police officers were aware \"that plaintiff was seriously in need of medical attention\" and, further, that the police officers \"deliberately assumed a posture of indifference to [Consolo's] medical needs,\" or \"intentionally failed to cooperate with medical personnel.\"  (Tr. 8-128)  Taken in context, and considered in light of the entire charge, these instructions adequately conveyed to the jury the analytic elements that are the necessary predicate to concluding that either Officer George or Officer Mulvey had acted with such recklessness as to constitute deliberate indifference.  While we disapprove of the reference to \"gross negligence\" in this context, there is here no plain error given the careful and detailed particularity of the jury instructions in their entirety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>2.

First, they argue, no reasonable jury could have concluded from the evidence at trial that the delay in affording Consolo medical care proximately caused his injuries to worsen.  George and Mulvey unfortunately focus their argument too narrowly.  Here the jury could well have based its decision not only upon a finding that the officers' deliberate indifference caused Consolo's medical condition to worsen, but also upon a finding that their deliberate indifference left him in pain and suffering for a longer period than would otherwise have been the case had he been afforded prompt medical attention.  The booking video, introduced as evidence at trial, shows Consolo in excruciating pain, barely standing even with assistance.  In fact, for the first few minutes of the video, Consolo is lying on the floor unable to get up.  In light of this evidence, the jury could reasonably conclude that the delay in providing Consolo medical treatment entitled him to damages for pain and suffering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Officers George and Mulvey argue that as matter of law they were entitled to qualified immunity in the circumstances presented at trial<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and thus are entitled to judgment n.o.v.  \"[The] operative inquiry on qualified immunity is not whether the defendants actually abridged the plaintiffs' constitutional rights, but whether the defendants' conduct was objectively reasonable, given the constitutional understandings then current.\"  Crooker v. Metallo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194966\"><a href=\"/opinion/194966/crooker-v-metallo/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">583</span></a></span>, 585 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the constitutional standard is clear.  Since at least 1983 there has been no doubt that a pre-trial detainee is entitled to medical attention for serious medical needs under the due process clause of the Constitution.  See City of Revere v. Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110998\"><a href=\"/opinion/110998/city-of-revere-v-massachusetts-gen-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span>, 244, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110998\"><a href=\"/opinion/110998/city-of-revere-v-massachusetts-gen-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span> </a></span>(1983).  Applying this legal standard to the record before the district judge, there was ample evidence that, given Consolo's condition at the time he entered the police station, the officers acted unreasonably in not seeking medical treatment for him before bringing him to the booking room.  Accordingly, the district court properly denied the claim of qualified immunity and submitted the issue to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Motions for a New Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officers George and Mulvey urge reversal of the decision of the district court to deny their motions for a new trial.  \"A district court should order a new trial only when convinced that the clear weight of the evidence so requires, or that a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.\"  Veranda Beach Club Ltd. v. Western Sur. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563774\"><a href=\"/opinion/563774/veranda-beach-club-limited-partnership-v-western-surety-co-frg-ventures/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1364</span></a></span>, 1384 (1st Cir.1991).  We will reverse the decision of a district court upon such a motion only where there has been an abuse of discretion.  There was no abuse of discretion here.  At bottom, the arguments of the police officers on this aspect of the case depend entirely upon their assessment as to the credibility of the evidence.  Having already concluded that the evidence was sufficient to warrant the jury's verdict, the jurors' assessment of credibility is conclusive and the decision of the district court to deny the motion for a new trial was well within its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4. Remittitur</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Officers George and Mulvey argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying their motion for remittitur.  When the jury first returned to the courtroom with its verdict, it found that Officers George and Mulvey were deliberately indifferent to Consolo's medical needs, that the City (but neither Officers George nor Mulvey) was grossly negligent on a pendant state claim, and awarded Consolo $90,000.  The district court pointed out to the jury that the finding against the City on the state claim was inconsistent with its findings for Officers George and Mulvey on that point, as the City could there be liable only upon a theory of vicarious liability, and the jury had not found the police officers liable.  The jury was instructed to continue its deliberations and, when it returned a verdict the second time, it had eliminated any finding against the City but retained its award to Consolo of $90,000 against Officers George and Mulvey for deliberate indifference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officers George and Mulvey now claim that the only way justly to construe the jury's verdict is to conclude that, because the City was somehow found a proximate cause of the damage to Consolo in the jury's first return, the award of $90,000 to him cannot stand as this sum remained consistent in both the first and second verdicts.  There is nothing to this argument.  It reduces to the claim that, because the City was let off, the damages should be reduced.  But whatever the basis for liability, here Consolo's damages were the same and each defendant, if liable at all, is liable jointly and severally for full damages.  As the verdict was entirely consistent with the evidence, the assessment of damages cannot be disturbed unless the award exceeded \"any rational appraisal or estimate of the damages that could be based upon the evidence\" or was \"grossly excessive,\" \"inordinate,\" \"shocking to the conscious of the court,\" or \"so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.\"  Segal v.

In Farmer, the Supreme Court adopted a subjective test for evaluating deliberate indifference in the Eighth Amendment context.  The present case arises in the context of the due process clause under the Fourteenth Amendment.
