The district  court ruled\r\n\nagainst  the Hotel  on  cross motions  for summary  judgment,\r\n\naffirming  the arbitral award.  The Hotel appeals.  We affirm\r\n\nthe ruling below.\r\n\n          This dispute arose from  a disagreement between the\r\n\nHotel and the appellee  Union as to the appropriate  ratio of\r\n\nbanquet waiters to function patrons, an issue that had been a\r\n\nsource of  conflict  for some  time.   On August  3, 1990,  a\r\n\ndispute  arose  again  over  the waiter-patron  ratio.    The\r\n\nbanquet waiters' union representative called a work stoppage;\r\n\nthe protest quickly  spread to all departments  of the Hotel.\r\n\nFor  two to  three hours, about  300 employees  stopped work,\r\n\nbringing the entire  Hotel's operations to a  standstill.  It\r\n\nis  undisputed that  the  action was  an  illegal strike,  in\r\n\nviolation of  the collective bargaining agreement.   At issue\r\n\nis the Hotel's response to the illegal strike.\r\n\n          The  Hotel terminated  all of the  banquet workers,\r\n\neven  though the  arbitrator found  that the  several waiters\r\n\nplayed decidedly  different roles in instigating  the strike.\r\n\nThe  employees  from  other   departments  were  only  mildly\r\n\npenalized,  by the  loss of  pay for  the two  or three  hour\r\n\nduration of  the strike.   The union sought  arbitration, and\r\n\nthe parties submitted the issue to the arbitrator as follows:\r\n\n\"[W]hether  the dismissal of all  the complainants was or not\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n[sic] justified.   If not,  that the  arbitrator provide  the\r\n\ncorresponding remedy.\"\r\n\n          The arbitrator  ruled that the  dismissals were not\r\n\njustified.   Specifically,  the  arbitrator  found  that  the\r\n\ndismissals  constituted  discrimination  against the  banquet\r\n\nworkers (as  a group) vis-a-vis  the employees  in the  other\r\n\ndepartments, and that the dismissals were unfair as among the\r\n\nindividual banquet workers because the remedy did not reflect\r\n\nthe  waiters' varying  levels of  culpability.   Having found\r\n\nthat  the  dismissal  of  the workers  was  unjustified,  the\r\n\narbitrator  proceeded  to  determine  an  appropriate remedy,\r\n\nconsistent  with  the  parties'  arbitral  submission.    The\r\n\narbitrator  divided the  waiters into  three groups  based on\r\n\ntheir  culpability  in instigating  the  strike.   All  three\r\n\ngroups were reinstated,  but backpay  and suspension  periods\r\n\nwere tailored to each group's culpability.\r\n\n          A court's  review of  a labor arbitration  award is\r\n\nhighly deferential.   See United Paper Workers Int'l Union v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMisco, Inc., 484  U.S. 29,  36-38 (1987) (\"[A]s  long as  the\r                       \r\n\narbitrator  is  even  arguably  construing  or  applying  the\r\n\ncontract and acting within the scope of its authority, that a\r\n\ncourt  is  convinced  he  committed serious  error  does  not\r\n\nsuffice  to overturn  his  decision.\").   The district  court\r\n\naffirmed  the  arbitrator's  award  in  a  comprehensive  and\r\n\ndetailed opinion, consistent with the deferential standard of\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nreview.  That opinion addresses all of the arguments that the\r\n\nHotel  raises in this appeal.
