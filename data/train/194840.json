We deny the petition. \n\n     In  1966, acting on a private  citizen petition, the FCC\n\nrequired broadcasters, under the  \"fairness doctrine,\" to air\n\nanti-smoking  messages  in  response  to   advertisements  by\n\ncigarette companies.  See Banzhaf v. FCC, 405 F.2d 1082 (D.C.\n                                        \n\nCir. 1968), cert.  denied, 396  U.S. 842 (1969).1   In  1969,\n                         \n\nCongress enacted the  Cigarette Labeling and  Advertising Act\n\n(\"the  Cigarette Act\"),  15  U.S.C.     1331  et seq.,  which\n                                                    \n\npertinently provided that \"it  shall be unlawful to advertise\n\ncigarettes  or little  cigars over  any medium  of electronic\n\ncommunication  subject  to the  jurisdiction  of  the Federal\n\nCommunications Commission.\"  15 U.S.C.   1335.  \n\n     In 1970,  an organization  called Action on  Smoking and\n\nHealth (\"ASH\") petitioned the  FCC to require broadcasters to\n\ncontinue   to  air   anti-smoking   messages,   despite   the\n\nprohibition  contained in  the Cigarette  Act, partly  on the\n\nground  that   the  cigarette  industry  was   using  \"hidden\n\n                    \n\n     1The   fairness  doctrine  was  an  FCC  rule  requiring\nbroadcasters  to  air  contrasting views  when  controversial\nissues were addressed.  See Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC,\n                                                            \n395  U.S.  367  (1968).    The  rule  was  abandoned  by  the\nCommission in  August 1987.   See Syracuse  Peace Council  v.\n                                                             \nFCC,  867 F.2d 654 (D.C.  Cir. 1989), cert.  denied, 493 U.S.\n                                                   \n1019 (1990).  \n\n                             -2-\n\ncommercials\" to circumvent  the Act.   The quoted phrase,  as\n\nACT  uses  it, refers  to  cigarette  company sponsorship  of\n\nsporting events during which the cigarette brand name or logo\n\nis displayed on signs or banners, which in turn are broadcast\n\nduring  televised  coverage  of  these events,  such  as  the\n\nMarlboro  Grand Prix auto race and  the Virginia Slims tennis\n\ntournament.  The FCC denied the ASH request.  The agency said\n\nthat  it found  no  hard  evidence  of  the  use  of  \"hidden\n\ncommercials\"  by the cigarette  industry, and  concluded that\n\n\"if such  abuses do occur .  . . , the  appropriate action in\n\nsuch an  eventuality would  be to secure  full and  effective\n\ncompliance with  the 1969 law,  and not  to deal  with it  by\n\noffsetting   anti-smoking   messages.\"       Formulation   of\n                                                             \n\nAppropriate Further Regulatory Policies  Concerning Cigarette\n                                                             \n\nAdvertising and  Antismoking Presentations, 27  F.C.C.2d 453,\n                                          \n\n458 n.5 (1970). \n\n     In 1990, ACT filed with the FCC the petition at issue in\n\nthis  case.    ACT claimed  that  there  is  now indisputable\n\nevidence  that   the  cigarette  industry  is  using  \"hidden\n\ncommercials.\"   According to  the petition the  Department of\n\nJustice has never initiated any enforcement proceedings under\n\nthe  Cigarette Act  and therefore  appears to  have concluded\n\nthat hidden commercials do  not violate the statute, creating\n\nthe need  for FCC action.   ACT requested the FCC  to issue a\n\n\"declaratory  ruling\" requiring licensees to air anti-smoking\n\n                             -3-\n\nmessages to offset the harm caused by the hidden advertising.\n\nBecause the fairness doctrine was no longer in existence, ACT\n\nrelied on  the \"public  interest standard\"  set forth  in the\n\nCommunications  Act  of 1934  to  govern  the regulation  and\n\nlicensing of broadcasters.   47 U.S.C.   303; see also id.   \n                                                         \n\n307(a), 309(a), 310(d). \n\n     ACT's petition  was denied  by the Commission  in August\n\n1992.  In re Petition For Declaratory  Relief Regarding Anti-\n                                                             \n\nSmoking Messages Filed by Action for Children's Television, 7\n                                                          \n\nF.C.C.R.  5466 (1992).  The FCC said that this issue had been\n\nraised and resolved  in the 1970 proceedings brought  by ASH,\n\nand  that ACT  had  presented nothing  new.   The  Commission\n\nstated that it \"continue[d] to believe that the Cigarette Act\n\nitself is  properly looked  to as  defining both  the conduct\n\nthat is prohibited  [with respect  to cigarette  advertising]\n\nand the  remedies that are available  to redress violations.\"\n\nId.  It is undisputed that the Department of Justice, not the\n  \n\nFCC, is exclusively charged  with enforcing the provisions of\n\nthe Cigarette Act.  See 15 U.S.C.   1339.   ACT now petitions\n                       \n\nthis court for review.2 \n\n                    \n\n     2It  appears that  ACT, which  had been  a Massachusetts\ncorporation, was formally dissolved  as of December 31, 1992,\nafter its petition was filed  in this court.  By  letter, the\nFCC says that ACT's  dissolution \"raises the question whether\nit  continues to be a  party aggrieved\" by  the FCC's action.\nIn response ACT  points out that  under Massachusetts law,  a\ndissolved corporation  \"shall nevertheless be continued  as a\nbody corporate  for three years  . .   . for  the purpose  of\nprosecuting or defending suits by or against it.\"  Mass. G.L.\n\n                             -4-\n\n     An  agency's decision  not to  undertake a  new project,\n                               \n\nregulation, or enforcement action  has been treated by courts\n\nas  a somewhat  unusual  animal in  the  menagerie of  agency\n\nactions  that may  be  presented  for  judicial review.    Of\n\ncourse, where there  is a statutory obligation  on the agency\n\nto take  a relatively specific  action, a court  might easily\n\nconclude that it  had both a standard to  apply to a shirking\n\nagency  and  a duty  to enforce  the  standard.   More often,\n\nagencies  make  decisions  not  to  act  under  rather  broad\n\nstatutory standards  or, as is typically  true of enforcement\n\nactions, under a general mandate to enforce the law. \n\n     In such cases courts have been reluctant to second-guess\n\nagencies  when   they  decline  to  act.     In  some  areas,\n\nparalleling  prosecutorial decisions not  to seek indictment,\n\ncourts are  reluctant to intervene  at all;  in others,  they\n\nhave  recognized  great  discretion  in the  agency  when  it\n\ndeclines to act and required only minimal justification.

Chaney, 470  U.S. 821  (1985);  United Church  of\n                                                             \n\nChrist v. FCC, 911 F.2d 813 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  As the circuit\n             \n\nmost  experienced  in these  matters  said  in another  case,\n\n                    \n\nch. 155,   51; see also City Communications, Inc. v. Detroit,\n                                                            \n888  F.2d 1081,  1086-87 (6th  Cir. 1989)  (looking to  state\ncorporate    law   to   determine   standing   of   dissolved\ncorporation).    Given the  statute  coupled  with the  FCC's\nposture on the issue, we think that denial of the petition on\nthe merits is the proper course.\n\n                             -5-\n\nNatural  Resources Defense  Council,  Inc. v.  SEC, 606  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1031, 1046 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (citations omitted):\n\n     An agency's discretionary  decision not to regulate\n                                            \n     a  given activity  is  inevitably  based, in  large\n     measure, on factors  not inherently susceptible  to\n     judicial  resolution  -- e.g.,  internal management\n                                  \n     considerations   as   to   budget  and   personnel;\n     evaluations  of its  own  competence;  weighing  of\n     competing   policies   within  a   broad  statutory\n     framework.  \n\n     This court  has made  similar  observations, see,  e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nWard v. Skinner,  943 F.2d 157, 161 (1st Cir.  1991), and the\n               \n\nstandard of  deference thus adopted  controls this case.   We\n\nneed not conclude that the FCC's refusal to undertake a rule-\n\nmaking  is  automatically  immune  from judicial  review,  no\n\nmatter  how  egregious  the  occasion or  how  troubling  the\n\nagency's explanation.   Here, the FCC's  explanation is quite\n\nrational.   In sum, the agency ruled that Congress provided a\n\ngeneral  ban on television cigarette advertising as part of a\n\n\"comprehensive\" federal  program, 15  U.S.C.   1331,  and, if\n\nthe ban  is being  infringed  at the  margins, Department  of\n\nJustice  enforcement is  the  preferable course.   Given  the\n\nFCC's broad  discretion  as  to  how to  deploy  its  limited\n\nresources, this is an adequate explanation.\n\n     ACT  says that the  explanation is faulty  to the extent\n\nthat  hidden commercials are a \"loophole\" in the law and thus\n\n                             -6-\n\nbeyond  the reach  of the  Department of  Justice.3   Even if\n\nthis  were  so,   it  would  not  make  the   FCC's  position\n\nunreasonable.  Instead, it could rationally leave to Congress\n\nthe  task   of  adjusting  the  balance  it   struck  in  its\n\n\"comprehensive\" statute.  Plugging  loopholes might also be a\n                                                        \n\nrational goal for  the agency  (we have no  occasion here  to\n\nconsider  preemption arguments);  but  agency  resources  are\n\nlimited and selecting which rational goals to  pursue is part\n\nof the agency's function.\n\n     There is  even less to ACT's  alternative criticism that\n\nthe  FCC's decision  in this  case  is inconsistent  with its\n\nreasoning in its  earlier decision declining to  act on ASH's\n\npetition.   ACT  argues that  the FCC  there declined  to act\n\nbecause it found  a lack of evidence  that hidden commercials\n\nwere a significant problem and, ACT says, it has now provided\n\nthe missing evidence.   But the FCC went on to say in the ASH\n                                                             \n\ncase  that, if the problem proved real, the solution would be\n\n\"to secure full and  effective compliance with the 1969  law,\n\nand not to deal with it by offsetting anti-smoking messages.\"\n\n27 F.C.C.2d at 458 n.5.  There is no inconsistency.\n\n     The petition for review is denied.\n                                      \n\n                    \n\n     3There is in fact some indication that the Department of\nJustice has  taken the  view that hidden  commercials violate\nthe  statute  and  has  written to  cigarette  companies  and\nbroadcasters  warning them of  its position.   Whether or not\nthis is the Department's present view is not material.\n\n                             -7-\n",

ACT claimed  that  there  is  now indisputable\n\nevidence  that   the  cigarette  industry  is  using  \"hidden\n\ncommercials.\"   According to  the petition the  Department of\n\nJustice has never initiated any enforcement proceedings under\n\nthe  Cigarette Act  and therefore  appears to  have concluded\n\nthat hidden commercials do  not violate the statute, creating\n\nthe need  for FCC action.

The  Commission\n\nstated that it \"continue[d] to believe that the Cigarette Act\n\nitself is  properly looked  to as  defining both  the conduct\n\nthat is prohibited  [with respect  to cigarette  advertising]\n\nand the  remedies that are available  to redress violations.\"\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  It is </span><pre class=\"inline\">undisputed that the Department of Justice, not the\n  \n\nFCC, is exclusively charged  with enforcing the provisions of\n\nthe Cigarette Act.

By  letter, the\nFCC says that ACT's  dissolution \"raises the question whether\nit  continues to be a  party aggrieved\" by  the FCC's action.\nIn response ACT  points out that  under Massachusetts law,  a\ndissolved corporation  \"shall nevertheless be continued  as a\nbody corporate  for three years  . .   . for  the purpose  of\nprosecuting or defending suits by or against it.\"  Mass.

Of\n\ncourse, where there  is a statutory obligation  on the agency\n\nto take  a relatively specific  action, a court  might easily\n\nconclude that it  had both a standard to  apply to a shirking\n\nagency  and  a duty  to enforce  the  standard.   More often,\n\nagencies  make  decisions  not  to  act  under  rather  broad\n\nstatutory standards  or, as is typically  true of enforcement\n\nactions, under a general mandate to enforce the law. \n\n     In such cases courts have been reluctant to second-guess\n\nagencies  when   they  decline  to  act.     In  some  areas,\n\nparalleling  prosecutorial decisions not  to seek indictment,\n\ncourts are  reluctant to intervene  at all;  in others,  they\n\nhave  recognized  great  discretion  in the  agency  when  it\n\ndeclines to act and required only minimal justification.

We\n\nneed not conclude that the FCC's refusal to undertake a rule-\n\nmaking  is  automatically  immune  from judicial  review,  no\n\nmatter  how  egregious  the  occasion or  how  troubling  the\n\nagency's explanation.   Here, the FCC's  explanation is quite\n\nrational.   In sum, the agency ruled that Congress provided a\n\ngeneral  ban on television cigarette advertising as part of a\n\n\"comprehensive\" federal  program, 15  U.S.C.   1331,  and, if\n\nthe ban  is being  infringed  at the  margins, Department  of\n\nJustice  enforcement is  the  preferable course.   Given  the\n\nFCC's broad  discretion  as  to  how to  deploy  its  limited\n\nresources, this is an adequate explanation.\n\n     ACT  says that the  explanation is faulty  to the extent\n\nthat  hidden commercials are a \"loophole\" in the law and thus\n\n                             -6-\n\nbeyond  the reach  of the  Department of  Justice.3   Even if\n\nthis  were  so,   it  would  not  make  the   FCC's  position\n\nunreasonable.  Instead, it could rationally leave to Congress\n\nthe  task   of  adjusting  the  balance  it   struck  in  its\n\n\"comprehensive\" statute.  Plugging  loopholes might also be a\n                                                        \n\nrational goal for  the agency  (we have no  occasion here  to\n\nconsider  preemption arguments);  but  agency  resources  are\n\nlimited and selecting which rational goals to  pursue is part\n\nof the agency's function.\n\n     There is  even less to ACT's  alternative criticism that\n\nthe  FCC's decision  in this  case  is inconsistent  with its\n\nreasoning in its  earlier decision declining to  act on ASH's\n\npetition.   ACT  argues that  the FCC  there declined  to act\n\nbecause it found  a lack of evidence  that hidden commercials\n\nwere a significant problem and, ACT says, it has now provided\n\nthe missing evidence.   But the FCC went on to say in the ASH\n                                                             \n\ncase  that, if the problem proved real, the solution would be\n\n\"to secure full and  effective compliance with the 1969  law,\n\nand not to deal with it by offsetting anti-smoking messages.\"\n\n27 F.C.C.2d at 458 n.5.  There is no inconsistency.\n\n     The petition for review is denied.\n                                      \n\n                    \n\n     3There is in fact some indication that the Department of\nJustice has  taken the  view that hidden  commercials violate\nthe  statute  and  has  written to  cigarette  companies  and\nbroadcasters  warning them of  its position.   Whether or not\nthis is the Department's present view is not material.\n\n                             -7-\n</pre>",
