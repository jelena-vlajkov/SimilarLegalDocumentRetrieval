Defendant,  Robert Parker, pled guilty\n                    \n\nto all counts of a twenty-count indictment  charging him with\n\nmaking and presenting false claims, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n  287, and mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C.   1341.  The\n\ndistrict  court sentenced him to 37 months in prison.  Parker\n\nappeals  his sentence  on the sole  ground that  the district\n\ncourt  erred in  increasing  his base  offense  level by  two\n\nlevels  pursuant  to  U.S.S.G.    3C1.1  for  obstruction  of\n\njustice. The  increase placed him in  a sentencing guidelines\n\nrange of  33 to 41 months,  instead of the range of  30 to 37\n\nmonths.  We affirm.\n\n                        I.  Background\n                                      \n\n     In sentencing  Parker, the  district  court adopted  the\n\nrecommendation  contained  in  the presentence  investigation\n\nreport (\"PSR\") that  the base offense  level be increased  by\n\ntwo levels pursuant to   3C1.1, which provides as follows:\n\n     If the  defendant willfully obstructed  or impeded,\n     or   attempted   to   obstruct   or   impede,   the\n     administration of justice during the investigation,\n     prosecution, or sentencing  of the instant offense,\n     increase the offense level by 2 levels.\n\nU.S.S.G.   3C1.1.   The commentary to    3C1.1 includes as an\n\nexample  of the type of  conduct to which  the obstruction of\n\njustice  enhancement  applies,  \"providing  materially  false\n\ninformation  to   a  probation   officer  in  respect   to  a\n\npresentence or other investigation for the court.\" U.S.S.G.  \n\n3C1.1, comment (n.3).1  \n\n                    \n\n1.  The references herein are to  the guidelines in effect on\nJanuary 12, 1994, the date of Parker's sentencing. \n\n     In explaining the  recommended increase for  obstruction\n\nof  justice, the PSR recounted that the probation officer who\n\nprepared that report specifically asked Parker if he had ever\n\nbeen  arrested  while living  in  Kansas from  1978  to 1986.\n\nParker replied  that he had  been arrested for  driving under\n\nthe  influence and had been placed on probation for one year.\n\nHe failed to mention  any other arrests.  A  subsequent local\n\nrecord check by a federal probation office in Kansas revealed\n\nthat Parker had been arrested there in 1984 for two counts of\n\nburglary  and  two counts  of  criminal  damage to  property.\n\nParker had pled  guilty to felony and misdemeanor  charges of\n\ncriminal  damage to  property  and had  received a  suspended\n\nprison sentence of 1 to 3 years. 2\n\n     In his objection  to the PSR, Parker  contended that his\n\nfailure  to  inform the  probation  officer  about his  other\n\nKansas arrests was not willful.  He explained the omission as\n\nfollows:\n\n     The  charges to which the Presentence Report refers\n     arose  out  of Mr.  Parker's destroying  his wife's\n     property in  the home that he  formerly shared with\n     his wife.    Although Mr.  Parker  soon  thereafter\n     became divorced, at the time of the incident he was\n     still married and was  a co-owner of the home.   It\n     was and  is Mr.  Parker's memory  and understanding\n     that  the whole  matter was handled  informally and\n     was  connected  to his  divorce.    At his  divorce\n     hearing his wife's attorney  brought up the  matter\n     of the  damaged property.   As part of  the divorce\n\n                    \n\n2.  At the  sentencing hearing,  the defense  attorney stated\nthat it was  unclear from the record whether  Parker actually\nserved time for these convictions.\n\n                             -3-\n\n     decree   Mr.   Parker  was   ordered  to   pay  her\n     restitution.  Immediately after the divorce hearing\n     Mr.  Parker went  to the  courthouse next  door and\n     pled guilty  to what he believed  was a misdemeanor\n     for  damaging  his  wife's  property.  It  was  his\n     understanding that he could  be charged with a more\n     serious crime and/or  sentenced to imprisonment  if\n     he failed to pay restitution.\n\n          At the interview with the Probation Officer on\n     November  15,  1993,  Mr.   Parker  stated  in  the\n     presence of  the officer  and his attorney  that he\n     had been ordered  to pay his wife restitution.  Mr.\n     Parker  did  not  explain  the  background  of  the\n     restitution order to the Probation  Officer because\n     of his (Mr. Parker's)  understanding that it was an\n     informal incident related to his divorce.\n\n     The  probation   officer,  in  his   response  to   this\n\nobjection,  noted  that  the  records  received  from  Kansas\n\ncontained nothing to indicate  that the defendant's  criminal\n\ncharges were  handled informally.   The Kansas  court records\n\nindicated  that  Parker was  represented  by  counsel at  his\n\nguilty plea  hearing and that  the court  questioned him  and\n\ndetermined  that  his  plea  to the  felony  and  misdemeanor\n\ncharges was voluntary and intelligent.  Parker was thereafter\n\nsentenced on those charges.   The probation officer concluded\n\nthat \"there is nothing in the record that would indicate that\n\nthe  defendant's plea was in  any way related  to his divorce\n\nproceedings.\"\n\n      At  the  sentencing hearing,  Parker conceded  that the\n\nconvictions had occurred and  that he did not report  them to\n\nthe probation officer.  He argued, however, that  his failure\n\nto  report them  resulted from  a misunderstanding  about the\n\n                             -4-\n\nnature of the offenses,  and was not willful.  Parker argued,\n\nthrough counsel,  that if he had intended to hide the fact of\n\nthe  prior  convictions  he   would  not  have  informed  the\n\nprobation  officer of  the restitution order  or that  he had\n\nlived in Kansas,  information that  \"directly led .  . .  the\n\nprobation officer  to that  conviction.\"  The  district court\n\nconcluded that a two-level  increase to Parker's base offense\n\nlevel for obstruction of justice was warranted.\n\n                        II. Discussion\n                                      \n\n     We review for clear error a district court's decision to\n\nincrease an offense level for obstruction of justice under \n\n  3C1.1.  United States v. Aymelek, 926 F.2d 64, 68 (1st Cir.\n                                  \n\n1991).   The government  has  the burden  of proving  willful\n\nobstruction of  justice by  a preponderance of  the evidence.\n\nId. at 67.   Therefore, our  inquiry here is  limited to  the\n   \n\nfollowing question:\n\n     whether there is sufficient evidence on the  record\n     to  support  a reasoned  conclusion  that appellant\n     [willfully] obstructed, or  attempted to  obstruct,\n     the proceedings.\n\nId. at 68.\n   \n\n     We  believe   that  the  record   supports  a  \"reasoned\n\nconclusion\" that Parker \"willfully\" attempted to obstruct the\n\nsentencing  proceedings by  omitting the  Kansas  arrests and\n\nconvictions for  criminal damage to property  when questioned\n\nby the  probation  officer.   Parker  argues on  appeal  that\n\n\"there was no evidence presented by the government from which\n             \n\n                             -5-\n\nthe  court  could conclude  that Parker  willfully obstructed\n                                                  \n\njustice.\"  We disagree.  \n\n     It  is  uncontested  that  the  arrests  and convictions\n\noccurred  and  that  Parker   failed  to  mention  them  when\n\nspecifically questioned about prior  arrests.  He  attributed\n\nthis failure  to a misunderstanding  about the nature  of the\n\nprevious  offenses.  In this  context, the information in the\n\nPSR  that Parker  was  represented by  counsel when  pleading\n\nguilty to  the unreported  criminal charges, that  the guilty\n\nplea was found to  be voluntary and intelligent and  that the\n\nKansas records contained nothing to indicate that the omitted\n\ncharges  were  handled   informally  (as  Parker  contended),\n\nconstitutes evidence of willfulness.    The inclusion of  the\n\nprior  convictions  had  the effect  of  increasing  Parker's\n\ncriminal history category. Therefore, Parker had a motive for\n\nomitting them.   This also constitutes some evidence that the\n\nomissions were willful.\n\n     The court  read Parker's written objections  to the PSR,\n\nheard his  counsel's arguments at the  sentencing hearing and\n\ngave  Parker an  opportunity to  speak at  the hearing.   The\n\ncourt did not believe the explanation Parker gave for failing\n\nto report the arrests and convictions:  that he misunderstood\n\nthe nature of the offenses.  See United States  v. Baker, 894\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  1083,  1085  (9th  cir.  1990)  (upholding  finding  of\n\n\"willfulness\"  where  sentencing court  \"afforded [defendant]\n\n                             -6-\n\nample opportunity to  refute allegations  in the  presentence\n\nreport  and  to present  his own  view  of the  facts\" before\n\nrejecting  defendant's explanation  that he  believed omitted\n\nconvictions weren't part of his criminal history).\n\n     In  United States  v. St.  Cyr, 977  F.2d 698  (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1992),  we  reviewed for  clear  error  the district  court's\n\nfinding  of \"willfulness\"  with  respect  to the  defendant's\n\nfailure to disclose previous  convictions and guilty pleas in\n\nhis interview with a  probation officer.  We upheld  the two-\n\nlevel increase for obstruction  of justice where the district\n\ncourt did not find  defendant's explanation for his omissions\n\n(that he had simply forgotten about his previous convictions)\n\ncredible.       \"In   the   sentencing   phase,   credibility\n\ndeterminations lie  within the domain of  the district court.\n\nOnly rarely -- and  in the most urgent circumstances  -- will\n\nwe, from the vista  of a sterile appellate record,  meddle in\n\nsuch matters.\" Id. at  706.   We reiterated that  \"when there\n                  \n\nare two plausible views of the record, the sentencing court's\n\nadoption of one such view cannot be clearly erroneous.\" Id.3\n                                                           \n\n     Similarly,  in this  case  the  district court  rejected\n\nParker's  explanation  for  failing to  disclose  the  Kansas\n\narrests and convictions.  Given the evidence that Parker  was\n\n                    \n\n3.  Parker's argument  that  any conflicts  in  the  evidence\nshould be resolved in defendant's favor pursuant to    3C1.1,\ncomment (n.1),  has repeatedly  been rejected by  this court.\nSee  Aymelek, 926 F.2d at 68. \n            \n\n                             -7-\n\nrepresented by  counsel when  pleading guilty to  the omitted\n\noffenses,  that his guilty plea was knowing and voluntary and\n\nthat Kansas court records gave no indication that the charges\n\nwere handled informally, it was not clearly erroneous for the\n\ndistrict  court   to  reject  Parker's  explanation  that  he\n\nmisunderstood  the  nature of  the  offenses.   The  district\n\ncourt's finding was based  on a plausible view of  the record\n\nand  cannot be rejected as  clearly erroneous. See   St. Cyr,\n                                                            \n\n977 F.2d  at 706.   See also United  States v. Tello,  9 F.3d\n                                                    \n\n1119  (5th  Cir.  1993)  (affirming  two-level  increase  for\n\nobstruction of  justice where district court  did not clearly\n\nerr in rejecting defendant's  explanation for failure to tell\n\nprobation officer about prior arrests and convictions).\n\n     Parker argues that this case is similar to United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Tabares, 951 F.2d 405 (1st Cir. 1991). There, we noted the\n          \n\nabsence  of evidence of willfulness.  We held that the giving\n\nof  a  false  social  security  number  was  not  \"material,\"\n\nreasoning that the number, which defendant had been using for\n\nsome   time,  likely   helped   investigators   looking   for\n\ndefendant's  prior work history.   See id.  at 411.   In this\n                                          \n\ncase, however, Parker concedes in his brief that the omission\n\nwas  \"material.\"    Moreover,  Parker's   argument  that  the\n\nincomplete  information disclosed  by him  --that restitution\n\nwas  ordered in his Kansas divorce  proceedings -- would have\n\nled to the  discovery of the omitted convictions for criminal\n\n                             -8-\n\ndamage  to property, is of no  avail.  The failure to provide\n\ncomplete information of his previous arrests  and convictions\n\ncertainly  delayed the  preparation  of an  accurate PSR  and\n\ncould  have resulted in an inaccurate sentencing computation.\n\nSee United States v. Baker, 894 F.2d at 1084.  \n                          \n\n     Finally,  Parker accuses  the district  court of  having\n\nmade up its mind  on the obstruction of justice  issue before\n\nhearing from  the  parties at  the sentencing  hearing.   The\n\nrecord   completely  belies  that   contention.    While  the\n\nsentencing judge stated that,  based upon his reading  of the\n\nPSR,  he was  persuaded that  an  obstruction of  justice had\n\noccurred, that  was merely a  statement of his  thinking thus\n\nfar  in the  process.  He  went on to  carefully consider the\n\nparties' arguments  at the  hearing.  He  questioned Parker's\n\nattorneys   closely  about   Parker's  explanation   for  his\n\nomissions  and   about  the  records  of   the  Kansas  court\n\nproceedings  before  ruling  that  a  two-level  increase for\n\nobstruction of justice was warranted.  \n\n     Accordingly, the  judgment is  summarily affirmed.   See\n                                                             \n\nLoc. R. 27.1.\n\n                             -9-\n",

It was his understanding that he could be charged with a more serious crime and/or sentenced to imprisonment if he failed to pay restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>At the interview with the Probation Officer on November 15, 1993, Mr. Parker stated in the presence of the officer and his attorney that he had been ordered to pay his wife restitution.  Mr. Parker did not explain the background of the restitution order to the Probation Officer because of his (Mr. Parker's) understanding that it was an informal incident related to his divorce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probation officer, in his response to this objection, noted that the records received from Kansas contained nothing to indicate that the defendant's criminal charges were handled informally.  The Kansas court records indicated that Parker was represented by counsel at his guilty plea hearing and that the court questioned him and determined that his plea to the felony and misdemeanor charges was voluntary and intelligent.  Parker was thereafter sentenced on those charges.  The probation officer concluded that \"there is nothing in the record that would indicate that the defendant's plea was in any way related to his divorce proceedings.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, Parker conceded that the convictions had occurred and that he did not report them to the probation officer.  He argued, however, that his failure to report them resulted from a misunderstanding about the nature of the offenses, and was not willful.  Parker argued, through counsel, that if he had intended to hide the fact of the prior convictions he would not have informed the probation officer of the restitution order or that he had lived in Kansas, information that \"directly led ... the probation officer to that conviction.\"  The district court concluded that a two- level increase to Parker's base offense level for obstruction of justice was warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review for clear error a district court's decision to increase an offense level for obstruction of justice under Sec. 3C1.1.   United States v. Aymelek, 926 F.2d 64, 68 (1st Cir. 1991).  The government has the burden of proving willful obstruction of justice by a preponderance of the evidence.   Id. at 67.  Therefore, our inquiry here is limited to the following question:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>whether there is sufficient evidence on the record to support a reasoned conclusion that appellant [willfully] obstructed, or attempted to obstruct, the proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that the record supports a \"reasoned conclusion\" that Parker \"willfully\" attempted to obstruct the sentencing proceedings by omitting the Kansas arrests and convictions for criminal damage to property when questioned by the probation officer.  Parker argues on appeal that \"there was no evidence presented by the government from which the court could conclude that Parker willfully obstructed justice.\"  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is uncontested that the arrests and convictions occurred and that Parker failed to mention them when specifically questioned about prior arrests.  He attributed this failure to a misunderstanding about the nature of the previous offenses.  In this context, the information in the PSR that Parker was represented by counsel when pleading guilty to the unreported criminal charges, that the guilty plea was found to be voluntary and intelligent and that the Kansas records contained nothing to indicate that the omitted charges were handled informally (as Parker contended), constitutes evidence of willfulness.  The inclusion of the prior convictions had the effect of increasing Parker's criminal history category.  Therefore, Parker had a motive for omitting them.  This also constitutes some evidence that the omissions were willful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court read Parker's written objections to the PSR, heard his counsel's arguments at the sentencing hearing and gave Parker an opportunity to speak at the hearing.  The court did not believe the explanation Parker gave for failing to report the arrests and convictions:  that he misunderstood the nature of the offenses.   See United States v. Baker, 894 F.2d 1083, 1085 (9th cir. 1990) (upholding finding of \"willfulness\" where sentencing court \"afforded [defendant] ample opportunity to refute allegations in the presentence report and to present his own view of the facts\" before rejecting defendant's explanation that he believed omitted convictions weren't part of his criminal history).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In  United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698 (1st Cir. 1992), we reviewed for clear error the district court's finding of \"willfulness\" with respect to the defendant's failure to disclose previous convictions and guilty pleas in his interview with a probation officer.  We upheld the two-level increase for obstruction of justice where the district court did not find defendant's explanation for his omissions (that he had simply forgotten about his previous convictions) credible.  \"In the sentencing phase, credibility determinations lie within the domain of the district court.  Only rarely-and in the most urgent circumstances-will we, from the vista of a sterile appellate record, meddle in such matters.\"   Id. at 706.  We reiterated that \"when there are two plausible views of the record, the sentencing court's adoption of one such view cannot be clearly erroneous.\"  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in this case the district court rejected Parker's explanation for failing to disclose the Kansas arrests and convictions.  Given the evidence that Parker was represented by counsel when pleading guilty to the omitted offenses, that his guilty plea was knowing and voluntary and that Kansas court records gave no indication that the charges were handled informally, it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to reject Parker's explanation that he misunderstood the nature of the offenses.  The district court's finding was based on a plausible view of the record and cannot be rejected as clearly erroneous.   See St. Cyr, 977 F.2d at 706.   See also United States v. Tello, 9 F.3d 1119 (5th Cir. 1993) (affirming two-level increase for obstruction of justice where district court did not clearly err in rejecting defendant's explanation for failure to tell probation officer about prior arrests and convictions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parker argues that this case is similar to  United States v. Tabares, 951 F.2d 405 (1st Cir. 1991).  There, we noted the absence of evidence of willfulness.  We held that the giving of a false social security number was not \"material,\" reasoning that the number, which defendant had been using for some time, likely helped investigators looking for defendant's prior work history.  See id. at 411.  In this case, however, Parker concedes in his brief that the omission was \"material.\"  Moreover, Parker's argument that the incomplete information disclosed by him-that restitution was ordered in his Kansas divorce proceedings-would have led to the discovery of the omitted convictions for criminal damage to property, is of no avail.  The failure to provide complete information of his previous arrests and convictions certainly delayed the preparation of an accurate PSR and could have resulted in an inaccurate sentencing computation.   See United States v. Baker, 894 F.2d at 1084.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Parker accuses the district court of having made up its mind on the obstruction of justice issue before hearing from the parties at the sentencing hearing.  The record completely belies that contention.  While the sentencing judge stated that, based upon his reading of the PSR, he was persuaded that an obstruction of justice had occurred, that was merely a statement of his thinking thus far in the process.  He went on to carefully consider the parties' arguments at the hearing.  He questioned Parker's attorneys closely about Parker's explanation for his omissions and about the records of the Kansas court proceedings before ruling that a two-level increase for obstruction of justice was warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the judgment is summarily affirmed.

Sec. 287, and mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341.  The district court sentenced him to 37 months in prison.  Parker appeals his sentence on the sole ground that the district court erred in increasing his base offense level by two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice.  The increase placed him in a sentencing guidelines range of 33 to 41 months, instead of the range of 30 to 37 months.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sentencing Parker, the district court adopted the recommendation contained in the presentence investigation report (\"PSR\") that the base offense level be increased by two levels pursuant to Sec. 3C1.1, which provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>If the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1.  The commentary to Sec. 3C1.1 includes as an example of the type of conduct to which the obstruction of justice enhancement applies, \"providing materially false information to a probation officer in respect to a presentence or other investigation for the court.\"  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1, comment (n.3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In explaining the recommended increase for obstruction of justice, the PSR recounted that the probation officer who prepared that report specifically asked Parker if he had ever been arrested while living in Kansas from 1978 to 1986.  Parker replied that he had been arrested for driving under the influence and had been placed on probation for one year.  He failed to mention any other arrests.  A subsequent local record check by a federal probation office in Kansas revealed that Parker had been arrested there in 1984 for two counts of burglary and two counts of criminal damage to property.  Parker had pled guilty to felony and misdemeanor charges of criminal damage to property and had received a suspended prison sentence of 1 to 3 years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his objection to the PSR, Parker contended that his failure to inform the probation officer about his other Kansas arrests was not willful.

Although Mr. Parker soon thereafter became divorced, at the time of the incident he was still married and was a co-owner of the home.  It was and is Mr. Parker's memory and understanding that the whole matter was handled informally and was connected to his divorce.  At his divorce hearing his wife's attorney brought up the matter of the damaged property.  As part of the divorce decree Mr. Parker was ordered to pay her restitution.  Immediately after the divorce hearing Mr. Parker went to the courthouse next door and pled guilty to what he believed was a misdemeanor for damaging his wife's property.
