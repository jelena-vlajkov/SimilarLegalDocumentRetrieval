Caron,  Attorney, Federal\n                                           \nAviation  Administration,  and   National  Transportation  Safety\nBoard, on brief for respondents.\n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n          Per Curiam.    Petitioner seeks review of  an order\n                    \n\nof  the   National  Transportation   Safety  Board   (\"NTSB\")\n\nreversing a decision by the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\").\n\nPetitioner  contends  that  the NTSB's  decision  arbitrarily\n\ndisregarded  its  own precedent,  and  was inconsistent  with\n\nFederal Aviation Regulations.   For the reasons  that follow,\n\nwe affirm the NTSB's decision.    \n\n          Petitioner,   a  licensed   transport  pilot,   was\n\noperating the  controls of a  DC-9 on September 29,  1987, as\n\nsecond-in-command  of Eastern Flight  603, when it  landed at\n\nWilliam  B. Hartsfield  Atlanta  International Airport.   The\n\nplane's  captain  was  operating  the  radios  at  the  time.\n\nAlthough  the aircraft  was cleared  by  Air Traffic  Control\n\n(\"ATC\") to land on Runway 26 left, petitioner  instead landed\n\non Runway 26  right without seeking  or receiving an  amended\n\nclearance.  While no injuries were reported, testimony at the\n\nsubsequent hearing  showed  that the  Eastern  flight  landed\n\nperpendicular to, and \"right  by [the] nose\" of  Delta flight\n\n657, which had been cleared to take off from Runway 26 right.\n\n          On  October 18,  1988,  the  Administrator  of  the\n\nFederal Aviation  Administration (\"Administrator\")  issued an\n\norder suspending petitioner's  pilot's certificate for twenty\n\ndays1    for   violation  of  Federal  Aviation   Regulations\n\n                    \n\n1.  The penalty  was waived  because petitioner had  reported\nthe  incident promptly through  the Aviation Safety Reporting\nProgram, but the judgment remains on his record.\n\n                             -2-\n\n(\"FAR\"), 14  C.F.R.     91.9, 91.87(h)  (1987).2   Petitioner\n\nappealed the order to  the NTSB and a hearing was held before\n\nan   Administrative  Law  Judge.     The  ALJ   reversed  the\n\nAdministrator's order, accepting petitioner's defense that he\n\nhad rightfully relied on the  direction of the captain of the\n\naircraft.   The Administrator appealed  and the full board of\n\nthe  NTSB   reversed  the   ALJ's  decision,   affirming  the\n\nAdministrator's suspension order.\n\n          At the hearing,  the parties stipulated to  most of\n\nthe  operative facts, including  the aircraft's  clearance to\n\nland on Runway 26 left,  its acknowledgment of the clearance,\n\nand its wrongful landing on  Runway 26 right.3  The remaining\n\n                    \n\n2.  14 C.F.R.     91.9, 91.87 (1987) (currently  14 C.F.R.   \n91.13(a)), 91.129(h)) state in relevant part: \n\n       91.9  Careless or reckless operation. \n                                           \n\n        No  person may operate an aircraft in a careless\n     or  reckless manner so  as to endanger  the life or\n     property of another.  \n\n       91.87 . . . .\n\n        (h)  Clearances required.  No person may, at any\n                                \n     airport with an operating control tower, operate an\n     aircraft on a runway or taxiway, or takeoff or land\n     an  aircraft, unless  an  appropriate clearance  is\n     received from ATC . . .\n\n3.  The parties stipulated to the following facts relating to\nclearance  and acknowledgment  for  use  of  Runway  26  left\n(\"26L\"):\n\n     [1]  [D]uring the  approach,  the terminal  arrival\n     radar H (TAR-H) controller  assigned the flight  to\n     Runway  26L, and that  Eastern 603 acknowledged the\n     transmission,  [2]  the   arrival  radar  V  (AR-V)\n\n                             -3-\n\nissue  was  whether,  in light  of  the  evidence, petitioner\n\nshould be absolved of the  violation by virtue of the Coleman\n                                                             \n\ndoctrine.  Administrator  v. Coleman, 1 N.T.S.B.  229 (1968).\n                                    \n\nIn Coleman  the NTSB held that a pilot  at the controls had a\n          \n\nright to  rely on his  copilot's confirmation of  the pilot's\n\nincorrect understanding of an ATC clearance.   \n\n          At the time  of the landing here, as  we have said,\n\nthe  captain  of  the  aircraft  was  operating  the  radios.\n\nPetitioner,  at the controls,  was also monitoring  the radio\n\ntransmissions  through an  overhead  speaker, in  conformance\n\nwith FAA and airline safety procedures.  The overhead speaker\n\nwas in working order and petitioner had no difficulty hearing\n\nthe   transmissions.    The  ATC  audiotape  of  the  radioed\n\nexchanges, stipulated by the parties to be accurate, reflects\n\nthat during the  approach the plane was instructed four times\n\nto land  on Runway 26 left.   Each of these  instructions was\n\nseparately acknowledged by the captain, who twice repeated it\n\n                    \n\n     controller  cleared   Eastern  603  for   a  visual\n     approach to Runway  26L and that the  clearance was\n     acknowledged,  [3]   the  ATL   automated  terminal\n     information   system   (ATIS)    was   transmitting\n     information  that Runway  26L  was the  appropriate\n     runway in use for landing, and that the information\n     was  received by Eastern  603, [4] the  local tower\n     controller cleared  Eastern 603 to  land on  Runway\n     26L   and   that  Eastern   603   acknowledged  the\n     clearance, [5] other  aircraft landing at  the time\n     were being cleared to land on Runway 26L.   \n\nAdministrator  v. Chaille, N.T.S.B.  Order No.  EA-3643, 1992\n                         \nNTSB LEXIS 176 at **2-3 (Aug. 12, 1992).\n\n                             -4-\n\nverbatim.    While petitioner initially testified that the he\n\ndid not  personally overhear an  ATC clearance for  Runway 26\n\nleft,  he  later  admitted  that  he  did  hear  the  correct\n\nclearance,  simultaneously with  the Delta  transmission, and\n\nbecame  alarmed.  Background  evidence showed that  98-99% of\n\nall prior landings,  and 100% of petitioner's  prior landings\n\nat  the subject  airport, had  been on  Runway 26  right, not\n\nRunway 26  left.  The  ALJ summarized the relevant  events as\n\nfollows:\n\n     Petitioner  obviously, even  though  he was  wrong,\n     through force of habit thought he was to land on 26\n     right.   When he  saw and  heard the  communication\n     relative  to the Delta airliner that was waiting on\n     the taxiway  on 26 right, and then  heard they were\n     to land on 26 left, then [petitioner] queried [the]\n     Captain . .  . as to where [they]  were supposed to\n     land.   The testimony is clear and unequivocal, the\n     Captain told him to land  on 26 right which he, the\n     First Officer, proceeded to do.\n\nAdministrator v.  Chaille, Dkt.  No. SE  9696, N.T.S.B.  Oral\n                         \n\nInitial Dec. at 151 (March 30, 1990).\n\n          The  ALJ concluded that while the case was \"close,\"\n\nunder  the  circumstances  petitioner  should  be  given  the\n\n\"benefit  of  the  doubt\"  and  excused  from  verifying  the\n\nclearance with [ATC]. \n\n     Ordinarily I would buy that [petitioner should have\n     called  ATC to verify the clearance], but here they\n     were well on their way to a few thousand feet above\n     the runway.  And in addition to that, it is obvious\n     that  the Eastern pilots had flown together on many\n     occasions.  There was great admiration  and respect\n     on the part of [petitioner] for [the] Captain . . .\n\n                             -5-\n\n Chaille, N.T.S.B. Oral Initial Decision at 151.\n        \n\n          The   NTSB,   on  the   other   hand,   viewed  the\n\napplicability of Coleman differently: \n                        \n\n     It is clear from Coleman  and the cases that follow\n                             \n     it   that  if   the   pilot   not  handling   radio\n     communications  does  not  hear  or  understand   a\n     transmission,  he  may, in  certain  circumstances,\n     rely  on the advice of  the pilot working the radio\n     as to  the  transmission's content.   However,  the\n     Administrator argues correctly, we think, that this\n     should  not be  extended  to situations  where  the\n     pilot who seeks to  rely on the radio operator  has\n     reason to  doubt the accuracy  of the advice  he is\n     given by  the other pilot.\n\n          .  .  .  .\n\n          In  the  interest  of  safety,  the  degree of\n     confusion in  the cockpit that  necessarily results\n     when the pilot operating the controls has heard two\n     conflicting   characterizations   of   the  landing\n     clearance,    should   prompt    a   request    for\n     clarification from ATC.  Force of habit and respect\n     are  not  factors  to  be  considered  by  a  pilot\n     determining  something as  important  as a  landing\n     clearance.\n\nAdministrator v. Chaille,  N.T.S.B. Order  No. EA-3643,  1992\n                        \n\nNTSB LEXIS 176 at **4, 6 (Aug. 12, 1992). \n\n          Petitioner argues that the NTSB's failure to  apply\n\nthe Coleman defense to the facts of his case was an arbitrary\n           \n\ndeparture  from its  own prior  holdings in  Coleman and  two\n                                                    \n\nlater  cases, Administrator v. Thomas, 3 N.T.S.B. 349 (1977),\n                                     \n\nand Administrator  v. Crawford, 1986  NTSB LEXIS 246  (May 8,\n                              \n\n1986).  While  the facts in each case  are unique, petitioner\n\npoints out that, in all three cases, the NTSB determined that\n\n                             -6-\n\na  pilot operating an  aircraft had reasonably  relied on the\n\nofficer operating the radio. \n\n          \"Under  our very narrow standard of review, we must\n\nuphold  the  [NTSB's]  decision  if  it  is  not  `arbitrary,\n\ncapricious,  an  abuse  of discretion,  or  otherwise  not in\n\naccordance with  the law.'\"   Hite v. NTSB,  991 F.2d  17, 20\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir.  1993) (quoting  5 U.S.C.    706(2)(a)).   \"We must\n\ndefer to  the wisdom of  the agency provided its  decision is\n\nreasoned and rational,  and even `uphold  a decision of  less\n\nthan ideal  clarity if  the agency's path  may reasonably  be\n\ndiscerned.'\"  Chritton v. NTSB,  888 F.2d 854, 856 (D.C. Cir.\n                              \n\n1989) (quoting Bowman  Transp. Inc. v.  Arkansas-Best Freight\n                                                             \n\nSystem, Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 286 (1974)).  \n            \n\n          Applying   this  standard,   we   think  the   NTSB\n\nreasonably  rejected   petitioner's  interpretation   of  the\n\nagency's prior decisions.   As  respondent's brief  contends,\n\nthe  facts in  each  of the  three  cited cases  differ in  a\n\ncritical respect  from those presented  by petitioner's case.\n\nIn   the  present  case,   the  NTSB  concluded   that  radio\n\ntransmissions which petitioner  personally overheard provided\n\nreason for  him to  question  the accuracy  of the  captain's\n\nstatement.   Petitioner therefore  should have  confirmed the\n\ncorrect runway clearance  with the controller.   By contrast,\n\nin Coleman and Thomas  the pilot at the  controls knew of  no\n                     \n\nreason to  doubt the  accuracy of  the clearance  information\n\n                             -7-\n\nrelayed by the  officer operating the radio.   In Coleman the\n                                                         \n\npilot incorrectly  understood  a  single  radio  transmission\n\nrelating  to   altitude.     He  relied   on  his   copilot's\n\nconfirmation,  in circumstances  where  the practice  was  to\n\navoid further radio communication with departure control.  In\n\nThomas, the pilot's reliance on a first officer's information\n      \n\nprovided  an  affirmative  defense where,  although  the  ATC\n\ninstruction was  transmitted, it was not received or heard by\n\nany  of  the three  officers  in  the  cockpit at  the  time.\n\nLikewise, in Crawford, the pilot had no known reason to doubt\n                     \n\nthat his  first officer had  accurately followed instructions\n\nby relaying  a crucial communication  to the ATC.   Thus, the\n\nNTSB's  decision here not  to extend the  Coleman affirmative\n                                                 \n\ndefense to absolve a pilot who heard at least one of the four\n\ncorrect transmissions but failed to follow through, was based\n\non a fair  reading and distinction between this  case and the\n\nagency's own precedents.4  \n\n          We  also  reject  petitioner's  argument  that  the\n\nNTSB's  decision arbitrarily  imposed upon him  an individual\n\nburden of  communication that violated other regulations, and\n\ncould   not  have   been   safely   accomplished  under   the\n\n                    \n\n4.  Respondent  attached to its brief copies of several other\nrecent NTSB  opinions where, in analogous  circumstances, the\nNTSB rejected a Coleman or similar defense, finding  that the\n                       \npilot's  reliance on another  officer or crew  member was not\njustified.  While we need not discuss these other cases here,\nwe wish to  acknowledge the thorough, careful  and persuasive\nanalysis of the issues presented in respondent's brief.     \n\n                             -8-\n\ncircumstances.  The  two regulations cited by  petitioner are\n\ninapposite.   The first,  14 C.F.R.    121.533(e)  (1987), is\n\ninapplicable  on its face.    The other,  14 C.F.R.   91.3(a)\n\n(1987), as interpreted by the NTSB, does not give the Captain\n\nfinal  authority to override an ATC  clearance in the absence\n\nof  an in-flight emergency.  Administrator v. Jesch, N.T.S.B.\n                                                   \n\nOrder  No. EA-3425,  slip  op.  at 6  (1991).   No  in-flight\n\nemergency  or hazard was claimed here.  Petitioner testified,\n\nmoreover, that when he heard the transmission that led him to\n\nquery the  captain,  he was  ready  to conduct  a  go-around,\n\npresumably   to  prevent   a  wrong   landing.     In   these\n\ncircumstances, the NTSB could fairly conclude that petitioner\n\nhad time to safely obtain a clarification from ATC.\n\n          The agency's  interpretation of  safety regulations\n\nis entitled  to a high  degree of deference from  this court.\n\nJanka v. NTSB, 925 F.2d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir. 1991).  Congress\n             \n\nhas  delegated to  the agency  the  responsibility to  ensure\n\nflight safety and avert preventable tragedies.  Hite v. NTSB,\n                                                            \n\n991 F.2d at 20; Johnson v. NTSB, 979 F.2d 618, 623  (7th Cir.\n                               \n\n1992);  Rochna v.  NTSB, 929  F.2d 13,  14 (1st  Cir.), cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied, 112 S. Ct. 305  (1991).  This court cannot substitute\n      \n\nits own judgment for that of the agency, especially where the\n\nissue, the relative safety of a pilot's in-flight operations,\n\nis peculiarly within  the agency's expertise.  We review only\n\nto  determine  whether  the  NTSB's  decision  is \"arbitrary,\n\n                             -9-\n\ncapricious,  an  abuse  of discretion,  or  otherwise  not in\n\naccordance with the law.\"  5 U.S.C.   706;  Hite, 991 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n20.  We see no abuse here.\n\n          Finally,   there  is   no  merit   to  petitioner's\n\ncontention  that the  NTSB mischaracterized both  his hearing\n\ntestimony  and the  ALJ'S  initial  decision.    Petitioner's\n\ntestimony contained inconsistencies,  a circumstance mirrored\n\nin the  ALJ's oral summary of  the evidence.  The  NTSB noted\n\nthe   inconsistencies    and,   contrary    to   petitioner's\n\ncharacterization, followed the ALJ's finding that, in effect,\n\npetitioner's admissions were more credible than his  denials.\n\nBased  on our  own  reading  of  the transcript,  the  NTSB's\n\ncharacterization of the evidence was fair and reasonable; and\n\nit was  supported by  substantial evidence.   Agency  factual\n\nfindings will not be disturbed on appeal so long as they rest\n\non substantial evidence.  Throckmorton v.

Thomas, 3 N.T.S.B. 349 (1977), AND Administrator v. Crawford, 1986 NTSB LEXIS 246 (May 8, 1986).  While the facts in each case are unique, petitioner points out that, in all three cases, the NTSB determined that a pilot operating an aircraft had reasonably relied on the officer operating the radio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Under our very narrow standard of review, we must uphold the [NTSB's] decision if it is not 'arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.' \"   Hite v. NTSB, 991 F.2d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#167;  706(2)(a)).  \"We must defer to the wisdom of the agency provided its decision is reasoned and rational, and even 'uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency's path may reasonably be discerned.' \"   Chritton v. NTSB, 888 F.2d 854, 856 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (quoting  Bowman Transp.  Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 286 (1974)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying this standard, we think the NTSB reasonably rejected petitioner's interpretation of the agency's prior decisions.  As respondent's brief contends, the facts in each of the three cited cases differ in a critical respect from those presented by petitioner's case.  In the present case, the NTSB concluded that radio transmissions which petitioner personally overheard provided reason for him to question the accuracy of the captain's statement.  Petitioner therefore should have confirmed the correct runway clearance with the controller.  By contrast, in Coleman and Thomas the pilot at the controls knew of no reason to doubt the accuracy of the clearance information relayed by the officer operating the radio.  In Coleman the pilot incorrectly understood a single radio transmission relating to altitude.  He relied on his copilot's confirmation, in circumstances where the practice was to avoid further radio communication with departure control.  In Thomas, the pilot's reliance on a first officer's information provided an affirmative defense where, although the ATC instruction was transmitted, it was not received or heard by any of the three officers in the cockpit at the time.  Likewise, in Crawford, the pilot had no known reason to doubt that his first officer had accurately followed instructions by relaying a crucial communica- tion to the ATC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the NTSB's decision here not to extend the Coleman affirm- ative defense to absolve a pilot who heard at least one of the four correct transmissions but failed to follow through, was based on a fair reading and distinction between this case and the agency's own precedents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject petitioner's argument that the NTSB's decision ar- bitratily imposed upon him an individual burden of communication that violated other regulations, and could not have been safely accomplishe d under the circumstances.  The two regulations cited by petitioner are inapposite.  The first, 14 C.F.R. &#167; 121.533(e) (1987), is inapplicable on its face.  The other, 14 C.F.R. &#167; 91.3(a) (1987), as interpreted by the NTSB, does not give the Captain final authority to override an ATC clearance in the absence of an in-flight emergency.  Administrator v. Jesch, N.T.S.B. Order No. EA-3425, slip op. at 6 (1991).  No in-flight emergency or hazard was claimed here.  Petitioner testified, moreover, that when he heard the transmission that led him to query the captain, he was ready to conduct a go-around, presumably to prevent a wrong landing.  In these circumstances, the NTSB could fairly conclude that petitioner had time to safely obtain a clarification from ATC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agency's interpretation of safety regulations is entitled to a high degree of deference from this court Janka v. NTSB, 925 F.2d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir. 1991).  Congress has delegated to the agency the responsibility to ensure flight safety and avert preventable tragedies.   Hite v. NTSB, 991 F.2d at 20;  Johnson v. NTSB, 979 F.2d 618, 623 (7th Cir. 1992);  Rochna v NT SB, 929 F.2d 13, 14 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct.  305 (1991).  This court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the agency, especially where the issue, the relative safety of a pilot's in-flight operations, is peculiarly within the agency's expertise.  We review only to determine whether the NTSB's decision is \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\"  5 U.S.C. &#167; 706;   Hite, 991 F.2d at 20.  We see no abuse here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there is no merit to petitioner's contention that the NTSB mischaracterized both his hearing testimony and the ALJ'S initial decision.  Petitioner's testimony contained inconsistencies, a circumstance mirrored in the ALJ's oral summary of the evidence.  The NTSB noted the inconsistencies and, contrary to petitioner's characterization, followed the ALJ's finding that, in effect, petition er's admissions were more credible than his denials.  Based on our own reading of the transcript, the NTSB's characterization of the evidence was fair and reasonable; and it was supported by substantial evidence.  Agency factual findings will not be disturbed on appeal so long as they rest on substantial evidence.  Throckmorton v. NTSB, 963 F.2d 441, 443 (D.C. Cir. 1992);  McCarthney v.  Busey, 954 F.2d 1147, 1153 (6th Cir. 1992);  Janka, 925 F.2d at 1151;   Chritton, 888 F.2d at 856;   cf.  Chirino v. NTSB, 849 F.2d 1525, 1529-30 (D.C.

As respondent's brief contends, the facts in each of the three cited cases differ in a critical respect from those presented by petitioner's case.  In the present case, the NTSB concluded that radio transmissions which petitioner personally overheard provided reason for him to question the accuracy of the captain's statement.  Petitioner therefore should have confirmed the correct runway clearance with the controller.  By contrast, in Coleman and Thomas the pilot at the controls knew of no reason to doubt the accuracy of the clearance information relayed by the officer operating the radio.  In Coleman the pilot incorrectly understood a single radio transmission relating to altitude.  He relied on his copilot's confirmation, in circumstances where the practice was to avoid further radio communication with departure control.  In Thomas, the pilot's reliance on a first officer's information provided an affirmative defense where, although the ATC instruction was transmitted, it was not received or heard by any of the three officers in the cockpit at the time.  Likewise, in Crawford, the pilot had no known reason to doubt that his first officer had accurately followed instructions by relaying a crucial communica- tion to the ATC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the NTSB's decision here not to extend the Coleman affirm- ative defense to absolve a pilot who heard at least one of the four correct transmissions but failed to follow through, was based on a fair reading and distinction between this case and the agency's own precedents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject petitioner's argument that the NTSB's decision ar- bitratily imposed upon him an individual burden of communication that violated other regulations, and could not have been safely accomplishe d under the circumstances.  The two regulations cited by petitioner are inapposite.  The first, 14 C.F.R. &#167; 121.533(e) (1987), is inapplicable on its face.  The other, 14 C.F.R. &#167; 91.3(a) (1987), as interpreted by the NTSB, does not give the Captain final authority to override an ATC clearance in the absence of an in-flight emergency.  Administrator v. Jesch, N.T.S.B. Order No. EA-3425, slip op. at 6 (1991).  No in-flight emergency or hazard was claimed here.  Petitioner testified, moreover, that when he heard the transmission that led him to query the captain, he was ready to conduct a go-around, presumably to prevent a wrong landing.  In these circumstances, the NTSB could fairly conclude that petitioner had time to safely obtain a clarification from ATC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agency's interpretation of safety regulations is entitled to a high degree of deference from this court Janka v.

This court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the agency, especially where the issue, the relative safety of a pilot's in-flight operations, is peculiarly within the agency's expertise.  We review only to determine whether the NTSB's decision is \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\"  5 U.S.C. &#167; 706;   <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604819\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hite,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/604819/thomas-d-hite-v-national-transportation-safety-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>.

Petitioner's testimony contained inconsistencies, a circumstance mirrored in the ALJ's oral summary of the evidence.  The NTSB noted the inconsistencies and, contrary to petitioner's characterization, followed the ALJ's finding that, in effect, petition er's admissions were more credible than his denials.  Based on our own reading of the transcript, the NTSB's characterization of the evidence was fair and reasonable; and it was supported by substantial evidence.  Agency factual findings will not be disturbed on appeal so long as they rest on substantial evidence.  Throckmorton v.
