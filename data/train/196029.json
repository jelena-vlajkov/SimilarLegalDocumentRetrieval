Torres'  principal\n\nchallenge to his conviction is that the  district court committed\n\nreversible error when it denied his renewed motion for severance.\n\nTorres also argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the\n\ndistrict   court   improperly  admitted   certain  co-conspirator\n\nstatements  against him.  Rodr guez and Matos both claim that the\n\nevidence was  insufficient to  support their convictions.   Matos\n\nalso  asserts  that the  district  court  erroneously denied  his\n\nmotion to suppress evidence  seized incident to his arrest.   All\n\nappellants  also challenge  their sentences, contending  that the\n\ndistrict  court erred in  its drug quantity  determinations.  For\n\nthe  following reasons,  we  affirm  appellants' convictions  and\n\nsentences.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\n\n          We  view and  present the  evidence in  the light  most\n\nfavorable  to the government.   United States v.  Abreu, 952 F.2d\r                                                                 \n\n1458, 1460 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,    U.S.   , 112 S. Ct. 1695,\r                                             \n\n118  L.Ed.2d 406 (1992).  The investigation of this case centered\n\non  the undercover  work of  Drug Enforcement  Agency  Task Force\n\nAgent Mart nez.  During the  course of this investigation,  Agent\n\nMart nez purchased  four ounces of  cocaine from David  Thomas on\n\nOctober  18, 1991 and November 1, 1991, respectively, and a half-\n\nkilogram  from Thomas  on November  8,  1991.   The investigation\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nculminated  on January  17, 1992  when defendant  Abelardo Cuevas\n\ndelivered ten kilograms of cocaine to Agent Mart nez.  \n\n          A.  The January 17, 1992 Transaction\r                    A.  The January 17, 1992 Transaction\r                                                        \n\n          On the morning of January 17, 1992, Mart nez and Cuevas\n\nspoke  on the telephone, and agreed to conduct the transaction in\n\nthe  parking   lot  of   a  Friendly's  restaurant   in  Peabody,\n\nMassachusetts.   In anticipation  of the transaction,  government\n\nagents   established  surveillance   in   several   areas.     At\n\napproximately  8:00  a.m.,  police  officers  observed  appellant\n\nTorres pick up Cuevas  in a brown Cadillac registered  to Thomas,\n\nand  drive away.  Approximately 45 minutes later, a state trooper\n\nsaw Torres and Cuevas pull up to the access code  box at the gate\n\nof  North  Shore  Self Storage.    Torres  used  the access  code\n\nassigned  to appellant  William  Rodr guez to  open the  security\n\ngate.  Torres and Cuevas then entered the storage facility.\n\n          Approximately  one minute  later,  the  trooper saw  an\n\nolder  blue Toyota station wagon pull  up to the access code box.\n\nAlthough the officer observed  that this car was occupied  by two\n\nHispanic  males, he  was forced  to look  away when  the two  men\n\nlooked directly at him.  Consequently, Trooper Dern was unable to\n\nidentify the men. The driver of this car, however, used Appellant\n\nRodr guez'  access code to open  the security gate  and enter the\n\nstorage grounds,  and the officials conducting  the investigation\n\nconcluded that these men were Rodr guez and appellant Matos.\n\n          Five  minutes  later,  Torres  and  Cuevas  exited  the\n\nstorage  grounds  in the  brown  Cadillac.   Approximately  three\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nminutes later,  the blue Toyota station wagon  exited the grounds\n\nas well.   Both Torres and  the driver of the  blue station wagon\n\nused Rodr guez' access code to  open the gate when they left  the\n\npremises. \n\n          Ten minutes  later, agents observed  Torres and  Cuevas\n\nenter  the parking lot of a  Friendly's restaurant in Peabody.  A\n\nfew  minutes  later, Agent  Mart nez  arrived  in his  undercover\n\nvehicle.   The  three men  met  briefly outside  the  restaurant.\n\nDuring this meeting, Cuevas introduced  Torres to Mart nez as his\n\n\"socio,\"  the  literal  translation  of  which  is  \"associate.\"1\r                \n\nTorres,  Cuevas, and  Mart nez  then entered  the restaurant  and\n\ndiscussed the mechanics of  the ten-kilogram transaction.  Torres\n\nstated  that he did not like the location and proposed completing\n\nthe transaction  in an  apartment, a proposal  Mart nez rejected.\n\nTorres then stated that they had to be careful, because they were\n\ntalking  about  ten  kilos,  not  one  or  two.    In  this  same\n\ndiscussion,  Torres  indicated  that  he  had  a  three  kilogram\n\ndelivery  to make  later  that day  in  Dorchester.   After  some\n\nfurther conversation  about the  details of the  transfer, Cuevas\n\ninstructed Torres to retrieve  the cocaine.  Torres then  left in\n\nthe brown Cadillac.\n\n          After  Torres left the parking lot, he drove south on a\n\nhighway  for a short time,  then suddenly exited  the highway and\n\nreversed  his  direction.    After  driving  north  for  a  short\n\n                    \r                              \n\n1  Appellant  Torres contends that in Caribbean  Spanish, \"socio\"\nis a colloquial term meaning \"buddy\" or \"cousin.\"  \n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\ndistance, he drove  into a  strip mall, parked  the Cadillac  and\n\nwent to the trunk  area of the car for a few  seconds.  According\n\nto  the  toll  records   obtained  for  the  cellular  telephones\n\nsubscribed to Torres  and Cuevas, Torres  contacted Cuevas at  or\n\nabout the time he reversed direction  on the highway.  After this\n\ncontact, Torres  returned to  the Friendly's restaurant,  and met\n\nagain  with  Mart nez  and  Cuevas  inside.   Torres  and  Cuevas\n\ninformed Mart nez  that they  would not complete  the transaction\n\nthere.   After  Mart nez complained  about the  sudden change  of\n\nplan, Cuevas agreed  to complete the deal  in an hour  at Weylu's\n\nRestaurant in Saugus, Massachusetts.  The three men then left, at\n\nabout 10:30 a.m.\n\n          After  Cuevas and  Torres  left the  parking lot,  they\n\ndrove  to an area near  the Northgate Shopping  Center in Revere,\n\nMassachusetts.  At approximately  10:55 a.m.,  an agent  observed\n\nTorres  driving  the brown  Cadillac,  alone,  south to  Chelsea,\n\nMassachusetts.   Torres  parked  the  Cadillac  in  front  of  20\n\nLawrence Street.  At approximately 11:15 a.m., Torres came out of\n\nthe  residence carrying a white shoulder bag.  Agents were unable\n\nto maintain surveillance of Torres after that.\n\n          At 11:30 a.m., agents observed a 1977 blue  BMW, driven\n\nby appellant Rodr guez, moving  slowly down the exit road  of the\n\nWeylu's Restaurant.    Appellant Matos  was seated  in the  front\n\npassenger  seat.  After driving down the exit road, Rodr guez and\n\nMatos drove slowly  through the lower  parking area past  several\n\nparked  cars, including  a DEA  surveillance  van.   As Rodr guez\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\ndrove past the van, both Rodr guez and Matos looked into the van,\n\nand  then parked behind it.   Rodr guez and  Matos remained there\n\nfor about five minutes.\n\n          At  about 11:34  a.m., Rodr guez  received a  page from\n\nCuevas.   Immediately after Rodr guez received  this page, agents\n\nobserved  Rodr guez and  Matos  drive away,  going  north on  the\n\nhighway.  The agents did not follow.\n\n          Approximately ten  minutes later, Mart nez drove  up to\n\nthe  front entrance  of  Weylu's.   As  Mart nez arrived,  Cuevas\n\nwalked up to his car and got in.  Once  inside Mart nez' vehicle,\n\nCuevas indicated  that he wanted  to leave the  area immediately.\n\nMart nez,  however, parked his car near the front entrance of the\n\nrestaurant.  After  Mart nez had parked, Cuevas informed him that\n\nhe had noticed two suspicious-looking  vans in the lower  parking\n\nlot, and explained that, because of his concern about these vans,\n\nhe  had removed  the drugs from  the area.   As the  two men were\n\nwalking toward the restaurant entrance, Cuevas explained that the\n\ncocaine  had  been  moved  to the  Kowloon  Restaurant,  a  short\n\ndistance away, and asked Mart nez to drive there to pick it up.\n\n          Once   inside  Weylu's,  Mart nez   demanded  that  the\n\ntransaction  be completed  there,  and Cuevas  agreed.   He  told\n\nMart nez that he  needed to contact his  men to have the  cocaine\n\nbrought  back  to  Weylu's.   After  Cuevas  said  this, Mart nez\n\nobserved  Cuevas using  his cellular  telephone to  contact these\n\nmen.  According to the toll records obtained for Cuevas' cellular\n\nphone,  Cuevas paged Rodr guez at  11:55 a.m. and  again at 12:03\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\np.m.  \n\n          When Rodr guez failed to respond to these pages, Cuevas\n\nreturned  to Mart nez'  table  and explained  that he  was having\n\ndifficulty  reaching his men.   Cuevas then pleaded with Mart nez\n\nto  travel  to the  Kowloon Restaurant  to  pick up  the cocaine.\n\nMart nez explained  that he could not complete the transaction at\n\nthe Kowloon  because he did not have the purchase money with him.\n\nMart nez and  Cuevas then agreed  to pick  up the cocaine  at the\n\nKowloon and then return to Weylu's.  \n\n          At  12:15 p.m.,  while Mart nez  and Cuevas  were still\n\ninside  Weylu's,  Rodr guez and  Matos  returned  to the  Weylu's\n\nparking lot  in the blue BMW.   They drove directly  to the upper\n\nparking area adjacent to the restaurant.  \n\n          At approximately 12:30 p.m.,  Mart nez and Cuevas  left\n\nWeylu's  and entered  Mart nez' car.   Almost  immediately after,\n\nRodr guez and Matos were  observed running from the drive-through\n\narea of the restaurant to  their car.  They got in  their car and\n\ndrove rather quickly after Mart nez'  car.  At the bottom  of the\n\nexit road,  Rodr guez and  Matos  pulled up  behind Mart nez  and\n\nCuevas, and then followed  Mart nez' car onto the highway.   Once\n\non  the highway,  Cuevas adjusted  Mart nez' rear-view  mirror so\n\nthat he, not Mart nez, had a better  view of traffic behind them.\n\nWhen Mart nez and Cuevas  entered the parking lot of  the Kowloon\n\nRestaurant,  Rodr guez and  Matos followed  them into the  lot as\n\nwell.\n\n          In  the parking lot, Cuevas left Mart nez' car, went to\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nthe  blue Toyota station wagon  parked there and  retrieved a gym\n\nbag containing  ten kilograms of  cocaine.  After  retrieving the\n\ncocaine,  Cuevas  returned  to  Mart nez'  car  and  the two  men\n\nreturned to Weylu's.  While he was waiting at a table to get paid\n\nfor the cocaine, Cuevas was placed under arrest.\n\n          As  Cuevas was  retrieving  the cocaine  from the  blue\n\nToyota,  Rodr guez and  Matos watched  from the  blue BMW.   When\n\nMart nez and Cuevas  left the Kowloon parking lot,  Rodr guez and\n\nMatos  pulled  onto the  highway and  followed  them.   They were\n\nfollowed  by agents in the  same surveillance van  that had drawn\n\nthe  attention  of  Rodr guez  and Matos  earlier  that  morning.\n\nRodr guez  and Matos drove north for a distance and then reversed\n\ndirection.   After driving  south a  short distance, they  pulled\n\nover to  the side of the road and allowed the surveillance van to\n\npass them.\n\n          After  the van  passed  them, Agent  Geibel, the  van's\n\ndriver, pulled  the van into a  parking lot and parked  there.  A\n\nshort  time later, Rodr guez and  Matos drove by  the lot slowly,\n\nlooking  at the  van  as they  passed.   Instead  of  continuing,\n\nhowever, Rodr guez and Matos pulled into the parking lot of a gas\n\nstation,  where  they  waited  for  about  five  minutes.    When\n\nRodr guez and Matos  exited the station parking lot, Agent Geibel\n\nalso pulled out  and followed  them.  Geibel  then followed  them\n\ninto the parking lot of a Sears store.  \n\n          After  parking their car,  Rodr guez and  Matos entered\n\nthe Sears store through the front entrance.  A few minutes later,\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nthey exited the  building through the rear entrance.   As the two\n\nmen  were walking along the  side of the  building, Rodr guez and\n\nMatos  again  looked  at  the  surveillance  van.    Rather  than\n\nreturning to their car,  they reentered the store through  a side\n\nentrance.   A few minutes later,  they exited the store  from the\n\nfront,  and  Rodr guez  walked  to  a  nearby  public  telephone.\n\nRodr guez was then arrested.  According to the cellular telephone\n\nrecords obtained for Torres'  cellular telephone, Torres placed a\n\npage to  Rodr guez at or about the  time that Rodr guez walked to\n\nthe payphone.\n\n          As Rodr guez  was being arrested, Matos  turned and ran\n\nback to the  store.  After a brief chase,  he was apprehended and\n\narrested.  At the  time of the arrest, Matos had the registration\n\nfor  the  blue  Toyota  station  wagon,  from  which  Cuevas  had\n\nretrieved the  cocaine, in his possession.  Later that afternoon,\n\nTorres was placed under arrest near his home in Chelsea.\n\n          B.  The Search of Rodr guez' Storage Unit\r                    B.  The Search of Rodr guez' Storage Unit\r                                                             \n\n          During  the  early  evening  hours of  that  same  day,\n\nJanuary 17,  1992,  agents  applied  for and  obtained  a  search\n\nwarrant  to search the storage unit at North Shore Storage rented\n\nby Rodr guez.  Torres had a key to this  unit, along with keys to\n\nthe brown Cadillac, in his possession at  the time of his arrest.\n\nRodr guez also had  a key to this storage unit on his key ring at\n\nthe time of his arrest. \n\n          The searching agents found a 1988  Ford Taurus car with\n\nNew York  license plates in  the storage unit.   Under the  front\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nseat of the car, agents found National Car Rental documents dated\n\nJanuary  11, 1992 in Cuevas' name.  A search of the trunk area of\n\nthe car  revealed  a  secret  compartment and  two  kilograms  of\n\ncocaine.    The  search  of  Rodr guez'  self-storage  unit  also\n\nproduced a  triple-beam scale, various packaging  materials and a\n\nsafe.   When  the  safe  was opened  a  few  days  later,  agents\n\ndiscovered  another   kilogram  of  cocaine  and  more  packaging\n\nmaterials.\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n          C.

Counts Two through\n\nFive of the indictment contained substantive distribution charges\n\nrelating to the  four undercover cocaine  purchases.

Rodr guez, Matos and  Thomas were\n\nsentenced  on December  8, 1992.   The  district  court sentenced\n\nThomas to 70 months' imprisonment.

R. Crim. P.  14, arguing that his  case\n\nshould be severed because \"one or more co-defendants has given or\n\nwould  give exculpatory  testimony or  evidence in his  behalf if\n\ncalled as a witness at  trial.\"  His motion was unaccompanied  by\n\naffidavit  or  other evidence  of such  a  witness.   Torres did,\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nhowever,  submit  an  affidavit   from  Cuevas  with  a  markedly\n\ndifferent  version of the events  of January 17,  1992.  Although\n\nCuevas' affidavit  attempted to exculpate Torres,  nothing in the\n\naffidavit indicated whether he  would actually testify on Torres'\n\nbehalf.     The  district  court  rejected   Torres'  motion  for\n\nseverance,  holding that  Torres  had not  met  his burden  under\n\nUnited States v. Drougas, 748 F.2d 8, 19 (1st Cir. 1984).\r                                  \n\n          Immediately  prior to  jury  selection  for his  trial,\n\nTorres filed  a Supplemental  Motion for Severance,  arguing that\n\nseverance  was required on two  grounds.  First,  he contended, a\n\nseverance was  required due to \"prejudicial  spillover.\"  Second,\n\nTorres contended that a  separate trial was required in  order to\n\nmake  Cuevas' exculpatory  testimony available  to him.    In his\n\nmotion,  Torres  admitted  that  Cuevas'  attorney  had  recently\n\nadvised Torres'  counsel that Cuevas would not testify on Torres'\n\nbehalf at a separate trial.  However, according to Torres, Cuevas\n\nhad  personally indicated to him that he would testify for Torres\n\nat  a separate trial.   Torres again failed,  however, to produce\n\nany affidavits supporting this  assertion.  Torres requested that\n\nthe court ask Cuevas directly of his intentions.  Cuevas' counsel\n\nobjected to such a  procedure.  The district court  then declined\n\nto question  Cuevas directly,  found that  the basis for  Torres'\n\nseverance motion  was \"entirely  too speculative\" and  denied the\n\nmotion.  Torres now challenges the district court's denial of his\n\nmotion.\n\n          We  have  held  that   \"[a]  motion  for  severance  is\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\ncommitted  to the  sound discretion  of the  trial court,  and we\n\nreview only for  a manifest  abuse of discretion  resulting in  a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.\"   United States v.

Under the Drougas test, in order to\r                                                         \n\nbe  entitled to  a  severance on  the  basis of  a  codefendant's\n\ntestimony,  the movant must demonstrate  1) a bona  fide need for\r                                                                  \n\nthe  testimony;  2)  the  substance  of  the  testimony;  3)  its\n\nexculpatory nature and effect;  and 4) that the codefendant  will\n\nin fact testify if the cases are severed.  A court reviewing such\n\na motion should 1)  examine the significance of the  testimony in\n\nrelation to  the defendant's defense theory;  2) consider whether\n\nthe   testimony  would   be  subject  to   substantial,  damaging\n\nimpeachment; 3)  assess the counterarguments of judicial economy;\n\nand 4) give weight to the timeliness of the motion.  Id. at 19.\r                                                                 \n\n          Torres did  not meet  the fourth  prong of the  Drougas\r                                                                           \n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\ntest -- i.e., he did not sufficiently establish that Cuevas would\r                      \n\nindeed testify in a  separate trial.  Torres insists  that Cuevas\n\nhad repeatedly assured him  that he would testify in  his behalf,\n\nyet  Torres  did not  submit any  affidavits,  either his  own or\n\nCuevas',  in  support of  these  assurances.   More  importantly,\n\nCuevas' attorney told Torres  and the district court specifically\n\nthat  Cuevas would not testify.   Torres concedes  now that \"some\r                                \n\ndoubt  remained\" as to whether Cuevas would actually testify at a\n\nseparate trial.  He argues, however,  that given this  doubt, the\n\ndistrict court  should have asked Cuevas  directly over counsel's\n\nobjection whether he would testify at a separate trial on Torres'\n\nbehalf,  and  that  the  court's  failure  to  ask this  \"single,\n\nclarifying question\"  of Cuevas  \"crippled\"  Torres' defense  and\n\nconstituted an abuse of discretion.\n\n          We have  held that an allegation that a codefendant may\n\ntestify, without more, is insufficient to  entitle a defendant to\n\nseverance.   United States v.  Nason, 9 F.3d  155, 159  (1st Cir.\r                                              \n\n1993).     Given the  complete lack  of  either factual  or legal\n\nsupport for Torres' request, it is  clear to us that the district\n\ncourt's refusal  to  interrogate  Cuevas  directly  was  entirely\n\nreasonable and  within  its  broad  discretion.2   This  lack  of\n\n                    \r                              \n\n2  The government suggests that because Cuevas had not waived his\nright to  counsel, a forced inquiry  of Cuevas by  the court over\r                                                                           \nhis  attorney's objection may well have given  rise to a claim by\r                                   \nCuevas that his Sixth Amendment  right to effective assistance of\ncounsel  had been compromised.   While  we do  not opine  on this\npossibility, such lurking  constitutional concerns underscore the\nreasonableness of the district court's refusal to question Cuevas\ndirectly.\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nevidence  also leads  us to the  inescapable conclusion  that the\n\ndistrict  court  properly applied  the  Drougas  test and  denied\r                                                         \n\nTorres' severance motion on this ground.\n\n            2.

Severance  to  avoid \"prejudicial  spillover\" of\r                                                                          \n                evidence\r                          evidence\r                                  \n\n          Torres also claims that because he only played a \"minor\n\nrole\"  in the charged conspiracy and much of the evidence adduced\n\nat trial  concerned the codefendants, he  was unfairly prejudiced\n\nby the  \"spillover\" of  this evidence.   \"Spillover\" occurs  when\n\nevidence establishing guilt of  one defendant, but not admissible\n\nagainst  another, creates  an  \"atmosphere  clouding  the  jury's\n\nability to evaluate fairly the guilt or innocence of the latter.\"\n\nUnited  States v. Perkins, 926  F.2d 1271, 1281  (1st Cir. 1991).\r                                   \n\nWe  have explained,  however, that  where evidence  featuring one\n\ndefendant is independently admissible against a  codefendant, the\n\nlatter  cannot convincingly  complain  of an  improper spillover.\n\nO'Bryant, 998 F.2d at 26.  Furthermore, the existence of stronger\r                  \n\nevidence  against  codefendants  does not  necessarily  entitle a\n\ndefendant  to   automatic  severance,  nor  does   a  defendant's\n\nrelatively minor  conspiratorial role  normally preclude  a joint\n\ntrial  with more prominent codefendants.  Welch, 15 F.3d at 1210.\r                                                         \n\nThus,  when multiple defendants are named in a single indictment,\n\na defendant who  seeks severance  will succeed only  by making  a\n\n\"strong showing of evident prejudice.\"  O'Bryant, 998 F.2d at 25.\r                                                          \n\nEven  where  large amounts  of  evidence  are irrelevant  to  one\n\ndefendant,  or where  one defendant's  involvement in  an overall\n\nconspiracy is far  less than  that of others,  a reviewing  court\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nmust be reluctant to second-guess severance denials.  Id. at 26.\r                                                                  \n\n          In support  of his  \"spillover\" claim,  Torres contends\n\nthat  the  government's   trial  evidence  actually  proved   two\n\nconspiracies,  not one,  as charged  in the  indictment.   Torres\n\nmaintains  that  the  evidence  proved  one  conspiracy involving\n\nThomas  and   Cuevas  that  produced  the   three  early  cocaine\n\ntransactions.  He contends  that the evidence then  established a\n\nsecond conspiracy involving Cuevas,  Rodr guez, Matos and himself\n\nto  deliver the  ten kilograms  of cocaine  on January  17, 1992.\n\nTorres  argues that he was unfairly prejudiced by the evidence of\n\nthe three  smaller cocaine transactions among  Agent Mart nez and\n\ndefendants Thomas and Cuevas.\n\n          Torres'   defense   counsel   raised   this   objection\n\nrepeatedly  during   trial,  and  the  district  court  carefully\n\ninstructed  the jury  with  respect  to  the  issue  of  multiple\n\nconspiracies.   Torres  did  not object  to  this aspect  of  the\n\ndistrict court's jury charge, and does not challenge it here.  \n\n          In  any  case,  the  evidence  strongly indicates  that\n\nTorres  was much more than a one-day, one-time conspirator, as he\n\nnow  avers.    During  his  conversations  with  Agent  Mart nez,\n\ndefendant Cuevas repeatedly stated that he needed to  confer with\n\nhis  \"partner.\"  When introducing  Torres, he referred  to him as\n\nhis \"socio,\" or associate.   Immediately before and after  one of\r                    \n\nhis   meetings  with   Mart nez   negotiating  a   multi-kilogram\n\ntransaction, Cuevas called Torres on his cellular telephone.  The\n\nevidence also  shows an  ongoing relationship between  Torres and\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nRodr guez, and  that Rodr guez was responding to  Torres' page at\n\nthe time of his arrest.   We think that this evidence  all fairly\n\nsupports the reasonable inference that Torres was Cuevas' partner\n\ninanongoingdrug\r                        conspiracy,whichincludedthethree\r                                                       smallertransactions.\n\n          Most  importantly,  the  evidence  introduced  at trial\n\nfirmly supports Torres' conviction  for participating in a single\n\nconspiracy to distribute ten kilograms of  cocaine on January 17,\n\n1992.    In  fact, the  evidence  indicates  that  Torres had  an\n\ninfluential,  even leading, role in the conspiracy.  He went with\n\nCuevas in the morning  to the storage facility where  the cocaine\n\nwas  presumably   stored;   he  actively   participated  in   the\n\ndiscussions  with  Agent  Mart nez,  suggesting  the  place   and\n\nmechanics of the transaction;  and he stated that he  had another\n\nsmaller delivery that day.   Torres has not indicated how he  was\n\nprejudiced  by any alleged \"spillover,\"  and in light  of all the\n\nevidence  against him, we do not see any prejudice.  Accordingly,\n\nwe affirm the district court's denial of his motion to sever.\n\n          B.   Admission  of  Co-Conspirator  Statements  against\r                    B.

R. Evid.\n\n801(d)(2)(E).  In particular,  Torres challenges the admission of\n\nthe statements made by Thomas to Agent Mart nez during a recorded\n\nconversation  on  October  18,  1991.   Torres  claims  that  the\n\nstatement  should have been excluded because  1) United States v.\r                                                                        \n\nPetrozziello,  548 F.2d  20 (1st  Cir. 1977),  requires  that the\r                      \n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\ngovernment  have independent  evidence that  the defendant  was a\n\nmember of the conspiracy at the time the co-conspirator statement\n\nwas  made; 2) there was no significant evidence linking Torres to\n\nthe conspiracy other  than the challenged  statement; and 3)  the\n\nstatement prejudiced him by \"possibly rais[ing] an inference that\n\nTorres had any knowledge of or connection to the drug trafficking\n\nactivities of Thomas and Cuevas before January 17, 1992.\"  \n\n          The test for admissibility of a coconspirator statement\n\nunder   Fed.

In\r                                 \n\nthe  instant case,  the district  court conducted  a Petrozziello\r                                                                           \n\nhearing at  the close of  all the evidence,  and concluded, by  a\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\npreponderance of  the evidence, that a  single conspiracy existed\n\nand that Torres  was a  participant.  Nothing  more was  required\n\nunder our precedents to  render the statements of co-conspirators\n\nThomas  and Cuevas admissible under  Rule 801(d)(2)(E).  In light\n\nof the ample  evidence, discussed  above, of the  existence of  a\n\nconspiracy and Torres' influential participation in it, we cannot\n\nsay that  the district court's Petrozziello  rulings were clearly\r                                                     \n\nerroneous.

Zapata,  18 F.3d  971,  975 (1st  Cir. 1994).3\r                                   \n\nRegardless  of the degree of deference in our review, however, we\n\nbelieve  that  the district  court  was correct  in  finding that\n\nMatos' arrest was supported by probable cause.\n\n          It  is  elementary  that  the  constitutionality  of  a\n\nwarrantless arrest depends upon  whether, at the time  the arrest\r                                                                           \n\nwas made,  the officers had probable cause to make it -- that is,\r                  \n\nwhether at that  moment the facts and  circumstances within their\n\nknowledge   and   of  which   they  had   reasonably  trustworthy\n\ninformation  were  sufficient  to  warrant a  prudent  person  in\n\nbelieving  that the defendant had committed  or was committing an\n\noffense.  United States  v. Morris, 977 F.2d  677, 684 (1st  Cir.\r                                            \n\n1992).  Probable cause is determined under an objective standard,\n\nand the government need  not show the quantum of  proof necessary\n\nto convict.   Id. Probability, and  not a prima facie  showing of\r                          \n\ncriminal activity, is the standard of probable cause.  Id.  \r                                                                   \n\n          We have held that probable  cause must be determined in\n\nlight of the collective knowledge of the law enforcement officers\n\ninvolved in an investigation.   United States v. Diallo,  19 F.3d\r                                                                 \n\n23, 25-26 (1st Cir. 1994).  Accordingly, an  officer's experience\n\nand expertise as a police officer may  also be crucial factors in\n\nthe probable cause determination.  United States  v. Maguire, 918\r                                                                      \n\n                    \r                              \n\n3   Here, the  district court  ruled on  Matos' motion  without a\nhearing and did not make specific findings of fact.  It is clear,\nhowever,  that  the  court  implicitly  adopted  the government's\nversion of the facts. \n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nF.2d 254, 258 (1st  Cir. 1990), cert. denied sub.  nom.

United States, 501 U.S. 1234 (1991).\r                          \n\n          Applying these principles here,  we think it clear that\n\nan  objective  view of  the  facts support  the  district court's\n\nfinding of probable cause  for Matos' arrest.  It  was Rodr guez'\n\nstorage  unit that Cuevas and  Torres accessed on  the morning of\n\nJanuary  17, 1992,  a  fact that  the  agents knew  during  their\n\nsurveillance of Matos  and Rodr guez that afternoon.   The agents\n\nalso  had a  reasonable  suspicion that  it  had been  Matos  and\n\nRodr guez  in the blue Toyota  station wagon who  met with Torres\n\nand  Cuevas at the storage facility that morning.  The activities\n\nof  Matos  and  Rodr guez  that afternoon  support  a  reasonable\n\ninference  that they were closely involved in the delivery of ten\n\nkilograms  of cocaine  to Mart nez  on January  17, 1992.   Their\n\nbehavior  and carefully  synchronized movements  strongly support\n\nthe  agents'  theory  that  they  were   in  charge  of  counter-\n\nsurveillance for  the transaction.   We therefore  find that  the\n\ndistrict court correctly denied Matos' motion to suppress.\n\n          E.   Denial of Matos' and Rodr guez' Motions for  Entry\r                    E.   Denial of Matos' and Rodr guez' Motions for  Entry\r                                                                           \nof             Judgments of Acquittal\r          of             Judgments of Acquittal\r                                               \n\n          Both Matos and Rodr guez challenge the district court's\n\ndenial of  their  motions  for judgments  of  acquittal.    Matos\n\ncontends that  his \"mere presence\" at the scene of a crime is the\n\nonly evidence  of his membership in the conspiracy, and therefore\n\nthat his  conviction cannot  stand.  Rodr guez  likewise contends\n\nthat no evidence of  his membership in the conspiracy  exists, or\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nthat he violated any laws, and that the government's case against\n\nhim is based solely on conjecture and speculative inference.\n\n          When  reviewing the denial of a  motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal, we assess the  sufficiency of the evidence as  a whole\n\nin  the light  most  favorable to  the verdict,  with  a view  to\n\nwhether a rational trier  of fact could have found  the defendant\n\nguilty  beyond a  reasonable  doubt.   We  do not  weigh  witness\n\ncredibility, but resolve  all credibility issues in favor  of the\n\nverdict.   United States  v.  Hahn, 17  F.3d 502,  506 (1st  Cir.\r                                            \n\n1994).  The evidence may be entirely circumstantial, and need not\n\nexclude  every  reasonable hypothesis  of  innocence.   In  other\n\nwords, the factfinder may decide among reasonable interpretations\n\nof the evidence.   Id.\r                               \n\n          Viewing the  evidence according to these principles, we\n\nthink it clear that  the convictions of both Matos  and Rodr guez\n\nwere  amply supported by the evidence.  Both of these appellants'\n\nchallenges rest on  the testimony offered by Rodr guez  at trial.\n\nRodr guez testified at trial that he had rented a storage unit at\n\nNorth Shore Self Storage with Cuevas for the purpose of repairing\n\na  car.   According  to  Rodr guez,  he  returned  his  keys  and\n\npaperwork to Cuevas  and did not return to the storage unit after\n\nDecember  19, 1991.  Rodr guez also denied driving to the storage\n\nunit on the morning of January 17, 1992, denied returning to  the\n\nWeylu's parking  lot, denied running  from the restaurant  to his\n\nBMW with Matos, and  denied following Mart nez and Cuevas  to the\n\nKowloon restaurant.  Rodr guez claimed that his only contact with\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nCuevas on  that day was to  drive him to Weylu's,  after which he\n\nand  Matos proceeded  to Sears  to go  shopping.   Rodr guez also\n\ndenied that he  was responding to a page from  Torres when he was\n\narrested, despite the records indicating that just moments before\n\nhis arrest he had been paged by Torres.\n\n          Clearly,  the jury  rejected  Rodr guez' testimony,  no\n\ndoubt  in light  of the evidence  to the contrary.   As discussed\n\nabove,  the  government  proved  through   strong  circumstantial\n\nevidence  that Rodr guez  and  Matos were  closely involved  with\n\nCuevas in the ten kilogram transaction.  The jury was entitled to\n\ndraw  reasonable inferences  from  this evidence,  and to  reject\n\nRodr guez' testimony in whole or in part.  We therefore find that\n\nthe evidence adduced at trial supports the jury's guilty verdict,\n\nand  that  the district  court  properly  denied the  defendants'\n\nmotions for judgments of acquittal.\n\n          F.   The Sentences of Torres, Matos &amp; Rodr guez\r                    F.   The Sentences of Torres, Matos &amp; Rodr guez\r                                                                   \n\n          All  of  the  appellants  challenge   their  sentences.\n\nTorres,  Rodr guez and  Matos  each challenge  the drug  quantity\n\ndeterminations  made by  the  district court  during  sentencing.\n\nTorres claims  that the district  court committed clear  error by\n\nattributing  to him  two  kilograms of  cocaine  discovered in  a\n\nsecond  storage unit at North  Shore Self Storage.  Consequently,\n\nTorres  argues,  his  Base  Offense Level  under  the  Sentencing\n\nGuidelines should have been 32 (5-15 kilograms of cocaine) rather\n\nthan  level 34 (15-50 kilograms of cocaine), as determined by the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\n          Rodr guez and Matos also  claim that the district court\n\ncommitted clear error in finding that a drug quantity of at least\n\nfive kilograms of cocaine was reasonably foreseeable to them as a\n\nconsequence  of   their   participation  in   the  ten   kilogram\n\ntransaction  of January  17,  1992.   Accordingly, Rodr guez  and\n\nMatos both claim that  their ten-year mandatory minimum sentences\n\nmust be vacated.\n\n          It is  well settled that \"[a]  narcotics conspirator is\n\nresponsible not only for the drugs he actually handled or saw but\n\nalso for the full quantity of drugs that he reasonably could have\n\nforeseen to be  embraced by  the conspiracy he  joined.\"   United\r                                                                           \n\nStates  v.

Moreover,  the district court's\r                \n\nfinding  as  to  the  quantity  embraced  by the  conspiracy  and\n\nreasonably  foreseen by the defendant  is a factual  one and will\n\nnot  be disturbed  unless  it  is clearly  erroneous.    Id.   In\r                                                                     \n\nreviewing drug quantity  determinations made by district  courts,\n\nwe  have held that the  sentencing court has  broad discretion to\n\ndetermine  what data is or  is not sufficiently  dependable to be\n\nused  in imposing sentences.   United States v.  Whiting, 28 F.3d\r                                                                  \n\n1296, 1304  (1st Cir. 1994)  (internal quotations  omitted).   We\n\nalso defer to the  sentencing court's credibility determinations.\n\nId. \r            \n\n            1.  The district court's drug quantity determination\r                      1.

The  district court concluded, based\n\non these findings, that Torres was \"involved and accountable\" for\n\nthe five kilograms  found in the  two units at  North Shore  Self\n\nStorage.    Torres  now argues  that  no  evidence  links him  to\n\nMariquesa Cuevas' storage unit or to the two kilograms of cocaine\n\nfound  therein.   He contends  that the  sentencing court  had to\n\nengage  in speculative and impermissible  leaps of logic in order\n\nto  attribute these two kilograms  to him, and  his sentence must\n\ntherefore be vacated.\n\n          The relevant  facts relied  upon by the  district court\n\nduring sentencing but  not introduced into evidence at  trial are\n\nas  follows.   During the  afternoon of  January 17,  1992, after\n\nCuevas had been arrested, his sister Mariquesa attempted to enter\n\nNorth Shore Self  Storage.   She was driving  Cuevas' gold  Honda\n\nAccord, a car that Cuevas had  driven to one of his meetings with\n\nAgent  Mart nez. Mariquesa Cuevas was  stopped by a state trooper\n\nbefore  she  could  enter  the storage  facility  premises.   The\n\n                    \r                              \n\n4  Mariquesa Cuevas, the sister of defendant Abelardo Cuevas, did\nnot appear  for trial and  is a fugitive  from justice.   The two\nkilograms of cocaine  found in  her storage unit  on January  17,\n1992 were therefore not introduced at trial.\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\nofficer  observed a large amount of cash  on the back seat of the\n\nHonda.   When asked about  the money, Mariquesa  Cuevas said that\n\nshe knew  nothing  about it,  and that  the car  belonged to  her\n\nbrother.  The car,  the money (approximately $7,000) and  the car\n\nkeys were then seized. \n\n          Later  that  evening, agents  obtained  and executed  a\n\nsearch warrant for a storage unit leased in the name of Mariquesa\n\nCuevas,  as well  as the  unit leased  in Rodr guez'  name.   Two\n\nkilograms of cocaine were  recovered from Mariquesa Cuevas' unit.\n\nAgents later determined  that one of the keys on the gold Honda's\n\nkey ring fit the lock to Mariquesa Cuevas' storage unit.\n\n          The district  court evidently found  Torres responsible\n\nat sentencing  for  these  two kilograms  because  of  the  ample\n\ncircumstantial evidence  of  his close,  influential  association\n\nwith Cuevas, and the  fact that Torres had the  key to Rodr guez'\n\nstorage  unit  in which  three kilograms  of cocaine  were found.\n\nDespite Torres'  protestations at  sentencing, the court  faced a\n\nsizeable quantity of evidence  that Torres exerted a significant,\n\neven a leading,  role in a  cocaine distribution conspiracy,  and\n\nthat use of  the storage units  at North Shore  Self Storage  was\n\npart of  the conspiracy's mechanics.   Therefore, even  if Torres\n\ndid not know  specifically about the  two kilograms in  Mariquesa\n\nCuevas'  storage unit, the  district court acted  well within the\n\nbounds of  its discretion  in concluding,  based  on its  factual\n\nfindings,  that Torres  could have  reasonably foreseen  that any\n\nadditional  cocaine found  in the  storage  unit would  be deemed\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\n\"embraced\" by the  overall conspiracy. Torres  fails to point  to\n\nany  competent evidence  that  contradicts  the district  court's\n\nfindings and conclusions, other than his own testimony.   Because\n\nthe district court was  entitled to disbelieve Torres' testimony,\n\nand because we  cannot say that the court's findings  of fact and\n\nconclusions were clearly  erroneous, we reject  Torres' challenge\n\nand affirm his sentence.\n\n            2.

They  contend  that  the\n\ngovernment  failed  to  establish  that they  had  the  requisite\n\nknowledge  of  the   the  amount  of  cocaine   involved  in  the\n\nconspiracy.   Accordingly,  they argue,  the  ten-year  mandatory\n\nminimum  penalty  prescribed  by  21  U.S.C.    841(b)(1)(A)(ii),\n\napplicable to  conspiracies involving  five or more  kilograms of\n\ncocaine, does not apply to them.\n\n          In  rejecting this  argument at  sentencing and  ruling\n\nthat  the  ten-year  mandatory  minimum  did  indeed  apply,  the\n\ndistrict  court  found by  a preponderance  of the  evidence that\n\nRodr guez  and Matos joined Cuevas  and Torres in  the morning of\n\nJanuary 17, 1992 to pick up the ten kilograms of cocaine from the\n\nstorage facility to sell to Agent Mart nez.  The evidence adduced\n\nat  trial, moreover,  also indicates  that it  was Rodr guez  and\n\nMatos who,  at Cuevas' instruction,  moved the  ten kilograms  of\n\ncocaine from  Weylu's restaurant to the  Kowloon restaurant later\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\nthat  day.    When  Rodr guez'  storage  unit  was  searched that\n\nevening, a car with  a secret compartment and three  kilograms of\n\ncocaine were found.  Rodr guez had a key to this unit at the time\n\nof  his  arrest.   In  light  of all  of  this  evidence and  the\n\nreasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom,  we cannot say\n\nthat the district court  committed clear error in finding  that a\n\ndrug  quantity   of  at  least  five   kilograms  was  reasonably\n\nforeseeable to both Rodr guez and Matos.\n\n          We have  previously explained  that \"[a]  defendant who\n\nconspires  to  transport for  distribution  a  large quantity  of\n\ndrugs,  but happens not to  know the precise  amount, pretty much\n\ntakes  his chances that the amount involved will be quite large.\"\n\nDe  La Cruz,  996 F.2d  at 1314.   We  see no  reason or  special\r                     \n\ncircumstances here to justify a departure from  our prior ruling.\n\nAccordingly, we reject Rodr guez'  and Matos' challenges to their\n\nten-year  minimum mandatory  sentences, and  affirm the  district\n\ncourt's ruling.5\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\n\n          For   the  foregoing   reasons,  the   convictions  and\n\nsentences  of  appellants   Torres,  Rodr guez,  and   Matos  are\n\naffirmed.\r                  \n\n                    \r                              \n\n5    Rodr guez and  Matos also  contend  that the  district court\nerroneously  refused to  consider  their  requests  for  downward\ndepartures.

Torres also argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the district court improperly admitted certain co-conspirator statements against him.  Rodriguez and Matos both claim that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions.  Matos also asserts that the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress evidence seized incident to his arrest.  All appellants also challenge their sentences, contending that the district court erred in its drug quantity determinations.  For the following reasons, we affirm appellants' convictions and sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We view and present the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.  United States v. Abreu, 952 F.2d 1458, 1460 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, __ U.S. __, 112 S. Ct. 1695, 118 L.Ed.2d 406 (1992).  The investigation of this case centered on the undercover work of Drug Enforcement Agency Task Force Agent Martinez.  During the course of this investigation, Agent Martinez purchased four ounces of cocaine from David Thomas on October 18, 1991 and November 1, 1991, respectively, and a half-kilogram from Thomas on November 8, 1991.  The investigation culminated on January 17, 1992 when defendant Abelardo Cuevas delivered ten kilograms of cocaine to Agent Martinez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The January 17, 1992 Transaction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of January 17, 1992, Martinez and Cuevas spoke on the telephone, and agreed to conduct the transaction in the parking lot of a Friendly's restaurant in Peabody, Massachusetts.  In anticipation of the transaction, government agents established surveillance in several areas.  At approximately 8:00 a.m., police officers observed appellant Torres pick up Cuevas in a brown Cadillac registered to Thomas, and drive away.  Approximately 45 minutes later, a state trooper saw Torres and Cuevas pull up to the access code box at the gate of North Shore Self Storage.  Torres used the access code assigned to appellant William Rodriguez to open the security gate.  Torres and Cuevas then entered the storage facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately one minute later, the trooper saw an older blue Toyota station wagon pull up to the access code box.  Although the officer observed that this car was occupied by two Hispanic males, he was forced to look away when the two men looked directly at him.  Consequently, Trooper Dern was unable to identify the men.  The driver of this car, however, used Appellant Rodriguez' access code to open the security gate and enter the storage grounds, and the officials conducting the investigation concluded that these men were Rodriguez and appellant Matos.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five minutes later, Torres and Cuevas exited the storage grounds in the brown Cadillac.  Approximately three minutes later, the blue Toyota station wagon exited the grounds as well.  Both Torres and the driver of the blue station wagon used Rodriguez' access code to open the gate when they left the premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ten minutes later, agents observed Torres and Cuevas enter the parking lot of a Friendly's restaurant in Peabody.  A few minutes later, Agent Martinez arrived in his undercover vehicle.  The three men met briefly outside the restaurant.  During this meeting, Cuevas introduced Torres to Martinez as his \"socio,\" the literal translation of which is \"associate.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Torres, Cuevas, and Martinez then entered the restaurant and discussed the mechanics of the ten-kilogram transaction.  Torres stated that he did not like the location and proposed completing the transaction in an apartment, a proposal Martinez rejected.  Torres then stated that they had to be careful, because they were talking about ten kilos, not one or two.  In this same discussion, Torres indicated that he had a three kilogram delivery to make later that day in Dorchester.  After some further conversation about the details of the transfer, Cuevas instructed Torres to retrieve the cocaine.  Torres then left in the brown Cadillac.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Torres left the parking lot, he drove south on a highway for a short time, then suddenly exited the highway and reversed his direction.  After driving north for a short distance, he drove into a strip mall, parked the Cadillac and went to the trunk area of the car for a few seconds.  According to the toll records obtained for the cellular telephones subscribed to Torres and Cuevas, Torres contacted Cuevas at or about the time he reversed direction on the highway.  After this contact, Torres returned to the Friendly's restaurant, and met again with Martinez and Cuevas inside.  Torres and Cuevas informed Martinez that they would not complete the transaction there.  After Martinez complained about the sudden change of plan, Cuevas agreed to complete the deal in an hour at Weylu's Restaurant in Saugus, Massachusetts.  The three men then left, at about 10:30 a.m.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Cuevas and Torres left the parking lot, they drove to an area near the Northgate Shopping Center in Revere, Massachusetts.  At approximately 10:55 a.m., an agent observed Torres driving the brown Cadillac, alone, south to Chelsea, Massachusetts.  Torres parked the Cadillac in front of 20 Lawrence Street.  At approximately 11:15 a.m., Torres came out of the residence carrying a white shoulder bag.  Agents were unable to maintain surveillance of Torres after that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 11:30 a.m., agents observed a 1977 blue BMW, driven by appellant Rodriguez, moving slowly down the exit road of the Weylu's Restaurant.  Appellant Matos was seated in the front passenger seat.  After driving down the exit road, Rodriguez and Matos drove slowly through the lower parking area past several parked cars, including a DEA surveillance van.  As Rodriguez drove past the van, both Rodriguez and Matos looked into the van, and then parked behind it.  Rodriguez and Matos remained there for about five minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At about 11:34 a.m., Rodriguez received a page from Cuevas.  Immediately after Rodriguez received this page, agents observed Rodriguez and Matos drive away, going north on the highway.  The agents did not follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately ten minutes later, Martinez drove up to the front entrance of Weylu's.  As Martinez arrived, Cuevas walked up to his car and got in.  Once inside Martinez' vehicle, Cuevas indicated that he wanted to leave the area immediately.  Martinez, however, parked his car near the front entrance of the restaurant.  After Martinez had parked, Cuevas informed him that he had noticed two suspicious-looking vans in the lower parking lot, and explained that, because of his concern about these vans, he had removed the drugs from the area.  As the two men were walking toward the restaurant entrance, Cuevas explained that the cocaine had been moved to the Kowloon Restaurant, a short distance away, and asked Martinez to drive there to pick it up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once inside Weylu's, Martinez demanded that the transaction be completed there, and Cuevas agreed.  He told Martinez that he needed to contact his men to have the cocaine brought back to Weylu's.  After Cuevas said this, Martinez observed Cuevas using his cellular telephone to contact these men.  According to the toll records obtained for Cuevas' cellular phone, Cuevas paged Rodriguez at 11:55 a.m.  and again at 12:03 p.m.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Rodriguez failed to respond to these pages, Cuevas returned to Martinez' table and explained that he was having difficulty reaching his men.  Cuevas then pleaded with Martinez to travel to the Kowloon Restaurant to pick up the cocaine.  Martinez explained that he could not complete the transaction at the Kowloon because he did not have the purchase money with him.  Martinez and Cuevas then agreed to pick up the cocaine at the Kowloon and then return to Weylu's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 12:15 p.m., while Martinez and Cuevas were still inside Weylu's, Rodriguez and Matos returned to the Weylu's parking lot in the blue BMW. They drove directly to the upper parking area adjacent to the restaurant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 12:30 p.m., Martinez and Cuevas left Weylu's and entered Martinez' car.  Almost immediately after, Rodriguez and Matos were observed running from the drive-through area of the restaurant to their car.  They got in their car and drove rather quickly after Martinez' car.  At the bottom of the exit road, Rodriguez and Matos pulled up behind Martinez and Cuevas, and then followed Martinez' car onto the highway.  Once on the highway, Cuevas adjusted Martinez' rear-view mirror so that he, not Martinez, had a better view of traffic behind them.  When Martinez and Cuevas entered the parking lot of the Kowloon Restaurant, Rodriguez and Matos followed them into the lot as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the parking lot, Cuevas left Martinez' car, went to the blue Toyota station wagon parked there and retrieved a gym bag containing ten kilograms of cocaine.  After retrieving the cocaine, Cuevas returned to Martinez' car and the two men returned to Weylu's.  While he was waiting at a table to get paid for the cocaine, Cuevas was placed under arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Cuevas was retrieving the cocaine from the blue Toyota, Rodriguez and Matos watched from the blue BMW. When Martinez and Cuevas left the Kowloon parking lot, Rodriguez and Matos pulled onto the highway and followed them.  They were followed by agents in the same surveillance van that had drawn the attention of Rodriguez and Matos earlier that morning.  Rodriguez and Matos drove north for a distance and then reversed direction.  After driving south a short distance, they pulled over to the side of the road and allowed the surveillance van to pass them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the van passed them, Agent Geibel, the van's driver, pulled the van into a parking lot and parked there.  A short time later, Rodriguez and Matos drove by the lot slowly, looking at the van as they passed.  Instead of continuing, however, Rodriguez and Matos pulled into the parking lot of a gas station, where they waited for about five minutes.  When Rodriguez and Matos exited the station parking lot, Agent Geibel also pulled out and followed them.  Geibel then followed them into the parking lot of a Sears store.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After parking their car, Rodriguez and Matos entered the Sears store through the front entrance.  A few minutes later, they exited the building through the rear entrance.  As the two men were walking along the side of the building, Rodriguez and Matos again looked at the surveillance van.  Rather than returning to their car, they reentered the store through a side entrance.  A few minutes later, they exited the store from the front, and Rodriguez walked to a nearby public telephone.  Rodriguez was then arrested.  According to the cellular telephone records obtained for Torres' cellular telephone, Torres placed a page to Rodriguez at or about the time that Rodriguez walked to the payphone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Rodriguez was being arrested, Matos turned and ran back to the store.  After a brief chase, he was apprehended and arrested.  At the time of the arrest, Matos had the registration for the blue Toyota station wagon, from which Cuevas had retrieved the cocaine, in his possession.  Later that afternoon, Torres was placed under arrest near his home in Chelsea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Search of Rodriguez' Storage Unit</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the early evening hours of that same day, January 17, 1992, agents applied for and obtained a search warrant to search the storage unit at North Shore Storage rented by Rodriguez.  Torres had a key to this unit, along with keys to the brown Cadillac, in his possession at the time of his arrest.  Rodriguez also had a key to this storage unit on his key ring at the time of his arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The searching agents found a 1988 Ford Taurus car with New York license plates in the storage unit.  Under the front seat of the car, agents found National Car Rental documents dated January 11, 1992 in Cuevas' name.  A search of the trunk area of the car revealed a secret compartment and two kilograms of cocaine.  The search of Rodriguez' self-storage unit also produced a triple- beam scale, various packaging materials and a safe.  When the safe was opened a few days later, agents discovered another kilogram of cocaine and more packaging materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Prior Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 30, 1992, a grand jury returned a five-count indictment against Cuevas, Torres, Rodriguez, Matos, and Thomas.  Count One charged all six with participating in a conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute.  Counts Two through Five of the indictment contained substantive distribution charges relating to the four undercover cocaine purchases.  Cuevas and Thomas were named as defendants in Counts Two, Three, and Four.  Cuevas, Torres, Rodriguez and Matos were named as defendants in Count Five, regarding the ten kilogram transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a trial, a jury returned guilty verdicts against all defendants on all counts.  Rodriguez, Matos and Thomas were sentenced on December 8, 1992.  The district court sentenced Thomas to 70 months' imprisonment.  Based on their participation in the ten kilogram transaction of January 17, 1992, Rodriguez and Matos each received ten-year, mandatory minimum sentences.  The district court sentenced Cuevas to 235 months' imprisonment, and Torres to 210-months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>ANALYSIS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Denial of Torres' Motion for Severance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several months prior to trial, Torres filed a motion for severance under Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 14, arguing that his case should be severed because \"one or more co-defendants has given or would give exculpatory testimony or evidence in his behalf if called as a witness at trial.\"  His motion was unaccompanied by affidavit or other evidence of such a witness.  Torres did, however, submit an affidavit from Cuevas with a markedly different version of the events of January 17, 1992.  Although Cuevas' affidavit attempted to exculpate Torres, nothing in the affidavit indicated whether he would actually testify on Torres' behalf.  The district court rejected Torres' motion for severance, holding that Torres had not met his burden under United States v. Drougas, 748 F.2d 8, 19 (1st Cir. 1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately prior to jury selection for his trial, Torres filed a Supplemental Motion for Severance, arguing that severance was required on two grounds.  First, he contended, a severance was required due to \"prejudicial spillover.\"  Second, Torres contended that a separate trial was required in order to make Cuevas' exculpatory testimony available to him.  In his motion, Torres admitted that Cuevas' attorney had recently advised Torres' counsel that Cuevas would not testify on Torres' behalf at a separate trial.  However, according to Torres, Cuevas had personally indicated to him that he would testify for Torres at a separate trial.  Torres again failed, however, to produce any affidavits supporting this assertion.  Torres requested that the court ask Cuevas directly of his intentions.  Cuevas' counsel objected to such a procedure.  The district court then declined to question Cuevas directly, found that the basis for Torres' severance motion was \"entirely too speculative\" and denied the motion.  Torres now challenges the district court's denial of his motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that \"[a] motion for severance is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and we review only for a manifest abuse of discretion resulting in a miscarriage of justice.\"  United States v. Welch, 15 F.3d 1202, 1210 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied sub. nom, Driesse v. United States, 114 S. Ct. 1661 (1994) and Welch v. United States, 114 S. Ct. 1863 (1994).  A trial judge thus has considerable latitude in deciding severance questions, and we will overturn that judge's resolution of them only if that wide discretion is plainly abused.  United States v. O'Bryant, 998 F.2d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 1993) (internal quotations omitted).  Reviewing Torres' challenge under this standard, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Severance to allow exculpatory testimony of a codefendant</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres' motion for severance in order to allow exculpatory testimony by a codefendant is governed by our holding in Drougas, 748 F.2d at 19.  Under the Drougas test, in order to be entitled to a severance on the basis of a codefendant's testimony, the movant must demonstrate 1) a bona fide need for the testimony;  2) the substance of the testimony;  3) its exculpatory nature and effect;  and 4) that the codefendant will in fact testify if the cases are severed.  A court reviewing such a motion should 1) examine the significance of the testimony in relation to the defendant's defense theory;  2) consider whether the testimony would be subject to substantial, damaging impeachment;  3) assess the counter-arguments of judicial economy;  and 4) give weight to the timeliness of the motion.  Id. at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres did not meet the fourth prong of the Drougas test-i.e., he did not sufficiently establish that Cuevas would indeed testify in a separate trial.  Torres insists that Cuevas had repeatedly assured him that he would testify in his behalf, yet Torres did not submit any affidavits, either his own or Cuevas', in support of these assurances.  More importantly, Cuevas' attorney told Torres and the district court specifically that Cuevas would not testify.  Torres concedes now that \"some doubt remained\" as to whether Cuevas would actually testify at a separate trial.  He argues, however, that given this doubt, the district court should have asked Cuevas directly over counsel's objection whether he would testify at a separate trial on Torres' behalf, and that the court's failure to ask this \"single, clarifying question\" of Cuevas \"crippled\" Torres' defense and constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that an allegation that a codefendant may testify, without more, is insufficient to entitle a defendant to severance.  United States v. Nason, 9 F.3d 155, 159 (1st Cir. 1993).  Given the complete lack of either factual or legal support for Torres' request, it is clear to us that the district court's refusal to interrogate Cuevas directly was entirely reasonable and within its broad discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  This lack of evidence also leads us to the inescapable conclusion that the district court properly applied the Drougas test and denied Torres' severance motion on this ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Severance to avoid \"prejudicial spillover\" of evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres also claims that because he only played a \"minor role\" in the charged conspiracy and much of the evidence adduced at trial concerned the codefendants, he was unfairly prejudiced by the \"spillover\" of this evidence.  \"Spillover\" occurs when evidence establishing guilt of one defendant, but not admissible against another, creates an \"atmosphere clouding the jury's ability to evaluate fairly the guilt or innocence of the latter.\"  United States v. Perkins, 926 F.2d 1271, 1281 (1st Cir. 1991).  We have explained, however, that where evidence featuring one defendant is independently admissible against a codefendant, the latter cannot convincingly complain of an improper spillover.  O'Bryant, 998 F.2d at 26.  Furthermore, the existence of stronger evidence against codefendants does not necessarily entitle a defendant to automatic severance, nor does a defendant's relatively minor conspiratorial role normally preclude a joint trial with more prominent codefendants.  Welch, 15 F.3d at 1210.  Thus, when multiple defendants are named in a single indictment, a defendant who seeks severance will succeed only by making a \"strong showing of evident prejudice.\"  O'Bryant, 998 F.2d at 25.  Even where large amounts of evidence are irrelevant to one defendant, or where one defendant's involvement in an overall conspiracy is far less than that of others, a reviewing court must be reluctant to second-guess severance denials.  Id. at 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his \"spillover\" claim, Torres contends that the government's trial evidence actually proved two conspiracies, not one, as charged in the indictment.  Torres maintains that the evidence proved one conspiracy involving Thomas and Cuevas that produced the three early cocaine transactions.  He contends that the evidence then established a second conspiracy involving Cuevas, Rodriguez, Matos and himself to deliver the ten kilograms of cocaine on January 17, 1992.  Torres argues that he was unfairly prejudiced by the evidence of the three smaller cocaine transactions among Agent Martinez and defendants Thomas and Cuevas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres' defense counsel raised this objection repeatedly during trial, and the district court carefully instructed the jury with respect to the issue of multiple conspiracies.  Torres did not object to this aspect of the district court's jury charge, and does not challenge it here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any case, the evidence strongly indicates that Torres was much more than a one-day, one-time conspirator, as he now avers.  During his conversations with Agent Martinez, defendant Cuevas repeatedly stated that he needed to confer with his \"partner.\"  When introducing Torres, he referred to him as his \"socio,\" or associate.  Immediately before and after one of his meetings with Martinez negotiating a multi-kilogram transaction, Cuevas called Torres on his cellular telephone.  The evidence also shows an ongoing relationship between Torres and Rodriguez, and that Rodriguez was responding to Torres' page at the time of his arrest.  We think that this evidence all fairly supports the reasonable inference that Torres was Cuevas' partner in an ongoing drug conspiracy, which included the three smaller transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most importantly, the evidence introduced at trial firmly supports Torres' conviction for participating in a single conspiracy to distribute ten kilograms of cocaine on January 17, 1992.  In fact, the evidence indicates that Torres had an influential, even leading, role in the conspiracy.  He went with Cuevas in the morning to the storage facility where the cocaine was presumably stored;  he actively participated in the discussions with Agent Martinez, suggesting the place and mechanics of the transaction;  and he stated that he had another smaller delivery that day.  Torres has not indicated how he was prejudiced by any alleged \"spillover,\" and in light of all the evidence against him, we do not see any prejudice.  Accordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of his motion to sever.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Admission of Co-Conspirator Statements against Torres</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres also maintains that the district court committed clear error when it admitted into evidence statements made by Thomas and Cuevas prior to January 17, 1992, under Fed.  R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).  In particular, Torres challenges the admission of the statements made by Thomas to Agent Martinez during a recorded conversation on October 18, 1991.  Torres claims that the statement should have been excluded because 1) United States v. Petrozziello, 548 F.2d 20 (1st Cir. 1977), requires that the government have independent evidence that the defendant was a member of the conspiracy at the time the co-conspirator statement was made;  2) there was no significant evidence linking Torres to the conspiracy other than the challenged statement;  and 3) the statement prejudiced him by \"possibly rais[ing] an inference that Torres had any knowledge of or connection to the drug trafficking activities of Thomas and Cuevas before January 17, 1992.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The test for admissibility of a coconspirator statement under Fed.  R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) is whether, under a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard, it is more likely than not that a conspiracy embracing both the declarant and the defendant existed, and that the declarant uttered the statement during and in furtherance of that conspiracy.  United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1180 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing, inter alia, Petrozziello, 548 F.2d at 23).  A district court's rulings on the admissibility of co-conspirator declarations are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.  Id. at 1180.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that when a defendant joins a conspiracy is irrelevant in determining whether a co-conspirator's statement is admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).  Once found to be a member of a conspiracy, a defendant is subject to proof of the prior acts and comments of his co-conspirators, even if those comments were made prior to the defendant's involvement in the conspiracy.  United States v. Masse, 816 F.2d 805, 811 (1st Cir. 1987).  In the instant case, the district court conducted a Petrozziello hearing at the close of all the evidence, and concluded, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a single conspiracy existed and that Torres was a participant.  Nothing more was required under our precedents to render the statements of co-conspirators Thomas and Cuevas admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).  In light of the ample evidence, discussed above, of the existence of a conspiracy and Torres' influential participation in it, we cannot say that the district court's Petrozziello rulings were clearly erroneous.  We therefore affirm Torres' conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Denial of Matos' Motion to Suppress</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 17, 1992, Matos moved to suppress evidence seized by the government incident to his arrest on the grounds that his arrest was conducted without probable cause.  Essentially, Matos claims that his arrest at the Sears store on January 17, 1992 was based on a mere hunch or subjective suspicion by the arresting agents that Matos and Rodriguez were conducting \"counter- surveillance\" for Cuevas' cocaine transaction.  In a written memorandum and order, the district court denied Matos' motion, concluding that his arrest was supported by probable cause.  The district court reviewed Matos' activities prior to his arrest, and noted that \"[t]he fact that Matos fled adds weight to the determination of probable cause, but is not necessary to that determination.\"  Matos now claims that we must find that the district court's denial of his suppression motion constituted reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's findings of fact on a motion to suppress are reviewable only for clear error as to probable cause, and questions of law remain subject to de novo review.  United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir. 1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Regardless of the degree of deference in our review, however, we believe that the district court was correct in finding that Matos' arrest was supported by probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is elementary that the constitutionality of a warrantless arrest depends upon whether, at the time the arrest was made, the officers had probable cause to make it-that is, whether at that moment the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent person in believing that the defendant had committed or was committing an offense.  United States v. Morris, 977 F.2d 677, 684 (1st Cir. 1992).  Probable cause is determined under an objective standard, and the government need not show the quantum of proof necessary to convict.  Id. Probability, and not a prima facie showing of criminal activity, is the standard of probable cause.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that probable cause must be determined in light of the collective knowledge of the law enforcement officers involved in an investigation.  United States v. Diallo, 19 F.3d 23, 25-26 (1st Cir. 1994).  Accordingly, an officer's experience and expertise as a police officer may also be crucial factors in the probable cause determination.  United States v. Maguire, 918 F.2d 254, 258 (1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied sub. nom.  Kavanaugh v. United States, 501 U.S. 1234 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these principles here, we think it clear that an objective view of the facts support the district court's finding of probable cause for Matos' arrest.  It was Rodriguez' storage unit that Cuevas and Torres accessed on the morning of January 17, 1992, a fact that the agents knew during their surveillance of Matos and Rodriguez that afternoon.  The agents also had a reasonable suspicion that it had been Matos and Rodriguez in the blue Toyota station wagon who met with Torres and Cuevas at the storage facility that morning.  The activities of Matos and Rodriguez that afternoon support a reasonable inference that they were closely involved in the delivery of ten kilograms of cocaine to Martinez on January 17, 1992.  Their behavior and carefully synchronized movements strongly support the agents' theory that they were in charge of counter-surveillance for the transaction.  We therefore find that the district court correctly denied Matos' motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. Denial of Matos' and Rodriguez' Motions for Entry of Judgments of Acquittal</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Matos and Rodriguez challenge the district court's denial of their motions for judgments of acquittal.  Matos contends that his \"mere presence\" at the scene of a crime is the only evidence of his membership in the conspiracy, and therefore that his conviction cannot stand.  Rodriguez likewise contends that no evidence of his membership in the conspiracy exists, or that he violated any laws, and that the government's case against him is based solely on conjecture and speculative inference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, we assess the sufficiency of the evidence as a whole in the light most favorable to the verdict, with a view to whether a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  We do not weigh witness credibility, but resolve all credibility issues in favor of the verdict.  United States v. Hahn, 17 F.3d 502, 506 (1st Cir. 1994).  The evidence may be entirely circumstantial, and need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.  In other words, the factfinder may decide among reasonable interpretations of the evidence.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the evidence according to these principles, we think it clear that the convictions of both Matos and Rodriguez were amply supported by the evidence.  Both of these appellants' challenges rest on the testimony offered by Rodriguez at trial.  Rodriguez testified at trial that he had rented a storage unit at North Shore Self Storage with Cuevas for the purpose of repairing a car.  According to Rodriguez, he returned his keys and paperwork to Cuevas and did not return to the storage unit after December 19, 1991.  Rodriguez also denied driving to the storage unit on the morning of January 17, 1992, denied returning to the Weylu's parking lot, denied running from the restaurant to his BMW with Matos, and denied following Martinez and Cuevas to the Kowloon restaurant.  Rodriguez claimed that his only contact with Cuevas on that day was to drive him to Weylu's, after which he and Matos proceeded to Sears to go shopping.  Rodriguez also denied that he was responding to a page from Torres when he was arrested, despite the records indicating that just moments before his arrest he had been paged by Torres.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clearly, the jury rejected Rodriguez' testimony, no doubt in light of the evidence to the contrary.  As discussed above, the government proved through strong circumstantial evidence that Rodriguez and Matos were closely involved with Cuevas in the ten kilogram transaction.  The jury was entitled to draw reasonable inferences from this evidence, and to reject Rodriguez' testimony in whole or in part.  We therefore find that the evidence adduced at trial supports the jury's guilty verdict, and that the district court properly denied the defendants' motions for judgments of acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">F. The Sentences of Torres, Matos &amp; Rodriguez</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the appellants challenge their sentences.  Torres, Rodriguez and Matos each challenge the drug quantity determinations made by the district court during sentencing.  Torres claims that the district court committed clear error by attributing to him two kilograms of cocaine discovered in a second storage unit at North Shore Self Storage.  Consequently, Torres argues, his Base Offense Level under the Sentencing Guidelines should have been 32 (5-15 kilograms of cocaine) rather than level 34 (15-50 kilograms of cocaine), as determined by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez and Matos also claim that the district court committed clear error in finding that a drug quantity of at least five kilograms of cocaine was reasonably foreseeable to them as a consequence of their participation in the ten kilogram transaction of January 17, 1992.  Accordingly, Rodriguez and Matos both claim that their ten-year mandatory minimum sentences must be vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well settled that \"[a] narcotics conspirator is responsible not only for the drugs he actually handled or saw but also for the full quantity of drugs that he reasonably could have foreseen to be embraced by the conspiracy he joined.\"  United States v. De La Cruz, 996 F.2d 1307, 1313 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 356 (1993).  Moreover, the district court's finding as to the quantity embraced by the conspiracy and reasonably foreseen by the defendant is a factual one and will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous.  Id. In reviewing drug quantity determinations made by district courts, we have held that the sentencing court has broad discretion to determine what data is or is not sufficiently dependable to be used in imposing sentences.  United States v. Whiting, 28 F.3d 1296, 1304 (1st Cir. 1994) (internal quotations omitted).  We also defer to the sentencing court's credibility determinations.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The district court's drug quantity determination as to Torres</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found Torres responsible for the ten kilograms involved in the January 17, 1992 transaction;  three kilograms found in Rodriguez' storage unit;  and two kilograms found in another storage unit belonging to Mariquesa Cuevas.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The district court based its sentencing determinations on its factual finding that Torres was \"very much involved\" in \"what was going on out at the storage location,\" and that the evidence regarding his participation in the cocaine distribution scheme with Cuevas was compelling.  The district court concluded, based on these findings, that Torres was \"involved and accountable\" for the five kilograms found in the two units at North Shore Self Storage.  Torres now argues that no evidence links him to Mariquesa Cuevas' storage unit or to the two kilograms of cocaine found therein.  He contends that the sentencing court had to engage in speculative and impermissible leaps of logic in order to attribute these two kilograms to him, and his sentence must therefore be vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant facts relied upon by the district court during sentencing but not introduced into evidence at trial are as follows.  During the afternoon of January 17, 1992, after Cuevas had been arrested, his sister Mariquesa attempted to enter North Shore Self Storage.  She was driving Cuevas' gold Honda Accord, a car that Cuevas had driven to one of his meetings with Agent Martinez.  Mariquesa Cuevas was stopped by a state trooper before she could enter the storage facility premises.  The officer observed a large amount of cash on the back seat of the Honda.  When asked about the money, Mariquesa Cuevas said that she knew nothing about it, and that the car belonged to her brother.  The car, the money (approximately $7,000) and the car keys were then seized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that evening, agents obtained and executed a search warrant for a storage unit leased in the name of Mariquesa Cuevas, as well as the unit leased in Rodriguez' name.  Two kilograms of cocaine were recovered from Mariquesa Cuevas' unit.  Agents later determined that one of the keys on the gold Honda's key ring fit the lock to Mariquesa Cuevas' storage unit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court evidently found Torres responsible at sentencing for these two kilograms because of the ample circumstantial evidence of his close, influential association with Cuevas, and the fact that Torres had the key to Rodriguez' storage unit in which three kilograms of cocaine were found.  Despite Torres' protestations at sentencing, the court faced a sizeable quantity of evidence that Torres exerted a significant, even a leading, role in a cocaine distribution conspiracy, and that use of the storage units at North Shore Self Storage was part of the conspiracy's mechanics.  Therefore, even if Torres did not know specifically about the two kilograms in Mariquesa Cuevas' storage unit, the district court acted well within the bounds of its discretion in concluding, based on its factual findings, that Torres could have reasonably foreseen that any additional cocaine found in the storage unit would be deemed \"embraced\" by the overall conspiracy.  Torres fails to point to any competent evidence that contradicts the district court's findings and conclusions, other than his own testimony.  Because the district court was entitled to disbelieve Torres' testimony, and because we cannot say that the court's findings of fact and conclusions were clearly erroneous, we reject Torres' challenge and affirm his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The district court's drug quantity calculations as to Rodr iguez and Matos</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez and Matos also argue that the ten kilograms of cocaine delivered to Agent Martinez on January 17, 1992 should not have been attributed to them.  They contend that the government failed to establish that they had the requisite knowledge of the the amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy.  Accordingly, they argue, the ten-year mandatory minimum penalty prescribed by 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(A)(ii), applicable to conspiracies involving five or more kilograms of cocaine, does not apply to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In rejecting this argument at sentencing and ruling that the ten-year mandatory minimum did indeed apply, the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Rodriguez and Matos joined Cuevas and Torres in the morning of January 17, 1992 to pick up the ten kilograms of cocaine from the storage facility to sell to Agent Martinez.  The evidence adduced at trial, moreover, also indicates that it was Rodriguez and Matos who, at Cuevas' instruction, moved the ten kilograms of cocaine from Weylu's restaurant to the Kowloon restaurant later that day.  When Rodriguez' storage unit was searched that evening, a car with a secret compartment and three kilograms of cocaine were found.  Rodriguez had a key to this unit at the time of his arrest.  In light of all of this evidence and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom, we cannot say that the district court committed clear error in finding that a drug quantity of at least five kilograms was reasonably foreseeable to both Rodriguez and Matos.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously explained that \"[a] defendant who conspires to transport for distribution a large quantity of drugs, but happens not to know the precise amount, pretty much takes his chances that the amount involved will be quite large.\"  De La Cruz, 996 F.2d at 1314.  We see no reason or special circumstances here to justify a departure from our prior ruling.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span> </span>(1992).  The investigation of this case centered on the undercover work of Drug Enforcement Agency Task Force Agent Martinez.  During the course of this investigation, Agent Martinez purchased four ounces of cocaine from David Thomas on October 18, 1991 and November 1, 1991, respectively, and a half-kilogram from Thomas on November 8, 1991.  The investigation culminated on January 17, 1992 when defendant Abelardo Cuevas delivered ten kilograms of cocaine to Agent Martinez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The January 17, 1992 Transaction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of January 17, 1992, Martinez and Cuevas spoke on the telephone, and agreed to conduct the transaction in the parking lot of a Friendly's restaurant in Peabody, Massachusetts.  In anticipation of the transaction, government agents established surveillance in several areas.  At approximately 8:00 a.m., police officers observed appellant Torres pick up Cuevas in a brown Cadillac registered to Thomas, and drive away.  Approximately 45 minutes later, a state trooper saw Torres and Cuevas pull up to the access code box at the gate of North Shore Self Storage.  Torres used the access code assigned to appellant William Rodriguez to open the security gate.  Torres and Cuevas then entered the storage facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately one minute later, the trooper saw an older blue Toyota station wagon pull up to the access code box.  Although the officer observed that this car was occupied by two Hispanic males, he was forced to look away when the two men looked directly at him.  Consequently, Trooper Dern was unable to identify the men.  The driver of this car, however, used Appellant Rodriguez' access code to open the security gate and enter the storage grounds, and the officials conducting the investigation concluded that these men were Rodriguez and appellant Matos.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five minutes later, Torres and Cuevas exited the storage grounds in the brown Cadillac.  Approximately three minutes later, the blue Toyota station wagon exited the grounds as well.  Both Torres and the driver of the blue station wagon used Rodriguez' access code to open the gate when they left the premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ten minutes later, agents observed Torres and Cuevas enter the parking lot of a Friendly's restaurant in Peabody.  A few minutes later, Agent Martinez arrived in his undercover vehicle.  The three men met briefly outside the restaurant.  During this meeting, Cuevas introduced Torres to Martinez as his \"socio,\" the literal translation of which is \"associate.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Torres, Cuevas, and Martinez then entered the restaurant and discussed the mechanics of the ten-kilogram transaction.  Torres stated that he did not like the location and proposed completing the transaction in an apartment, a proposal Martinez rejected.  Torres then stated that they had to be careful, because they were talking about ten kilos, not one or two.  In this same discussion, Torres indicated that he had a three kilogram delivery to make later that day in Dorchester.  After some further conversation about the details of the transfer, Cuevas instructed Torres to retrieve the cocaine.  Torres then left in the brown Cadillac.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Torres left the parking lot, he drove south on a highway for a short time, then suddenly exited the highway and reversed his direction.  After driving north for a short distance, he drove into a strip mall, parked the Cadillac and went to the trunk area of the car for a few seconds.  According to the toll records obtained for the cellular telephones subscribed to Torres and Cuevas, Torres contacted Cuevas at or about the time he reversed direction on the highway.  After this contact, Torres returned to the Friendly's restaurant, and met again with Martinez and Cuevas inside.  Torres and Cuevas informed Martinez that they would not complete the transaction there.  After Martinez complained about the sudden change of plan, Cuevas agreed to complete the deal in an hour at Weylu's Restaurant in Saugus, Massachusetts.  The three men then left, at about 10:30 a.m.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Cuevas and Torres left the parking lot, they drove to an area near the Northgate Shopping Center in Revere, Massachusetts.  At approximately 10:55 a.m., an agent observed Torres driving the brown Cadillac, alone, south to Chelsea, Massachusetts.  Torres parked the Cadillac in front of 20 Lawrence Street.  At approximately 11:15 a.m., Torres came out of the residence carrying a white shoulder bag.  Agents were unable to maintain surveillance of Torres after that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 11:30 a.m., agents observed a 1977 blue BMW, driven by appellant Rodriguez, moving slowly down the exit road of the Weylu's Restaurant.  Appellant Matos was seated in the front passenger seat.  After driving down the exit road, Rodriguez and Matos drove slowly through the lower parking area past several parked cars, including a DEA surveillance van.  As Rodriguez drove past the van, both Rodriguez and Matos looked into the van, and then parked behind it.  Rodriguez and Matos remained there for about five minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At about 11:34 a.m., Rodriguez received a page from Cuevas.  Immediately after Rodriguez received this page, agents observed Rodriguez and Matos drive away, going north on the highway.  The agents did not follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately ten minutes later, Martinez drove up to the front entrance of Weylu's.  As Martinez arrived, Cuevas walked up to his car and got in.  Once inside Martinez' vehicle, Cuevas indicated that he wanted to leave the area immediately.  Martinez, however, parked his car near the front entrance of the restaurant.  After Martinez had parked, Cuevas informed him that he had noticed two suspicious-looking vans in the lower parking lot, and explained that, because of his concern about these vans, he had removed the drugs from the area.  As the two men were walking toward the restaurant entrance, Cuevas explained that the cocaine had been moved to the Kowloon Restaurant, a short distance away, and asked Martinez to drive there to pick it up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once inside Weylu's, Martinez demanded that the transaction be completed there, and Cuevas agreed.  He told Martinez that he needed to contact his men to have the cocaine brought back to Weylu's.  After Cuevas said this, Martinez observed Cuevas using his cellular telephone to contact these men.  According to the toll records obtained for Cuevas' cellular phone, Cuevas paged Rodriguez at 11:55 a.m.  and again at 12:03 p.m.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Rodriguez failed to respond to these pages, Cuevas returned to Martinez' table and explained that he was having difficulty reaching his men.  Cuevas then pleaded with Martinez to travel to the Kowloon Restaurant to pick up the cocaine.  Martinez explained that he could not complete the transaction at the Kowloon because he did not have the purchase money with him.  Martinez and Cuevas then agreed to pick up the cocaine at the Kowloon and then return to Weylu's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 12:15 p.m., while Martinez and Cuevas were still inside Weylu's, Rodriguez and Matos returned to the Weylu's parking lot in the blue BMW. They drove directly to the upper parking area adjacent to the restaurant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 12:30 p.m., Martinez and Cuevas left Weylu's and entered Martinez' car.  Almost immediately after, Rodriguez and Matos were observed running from the drive-through area of the restaurant to their car.  They got in their car and drove rather quickly after Martinez' car.  At the bottom of the exit road, Rodriguez and Matos pulled up behind Martinez and Cuevas, and then followed Martinez' car onto the highway.  Once on the highway, Cuevas adjusted Martinez' rear-view mirror so that he, not Martinez, had a better view of traffic behind them.  When Martinez and Cuevas entered the parking lot of the Kowloon Restaurant, Rodriguez and Matos followed them into the lot as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the parking lot, Cuevas left Martinez' car, went to the blue Toyota station wagon parked there and retrieved a gym bag containing ten kilograms of cocaine.  After retrieving the cocaine, Cuevas returned to Martinez' car and the two men returned to Weylu's.  While he was waiting at a table to get paid for the cocaine, Cuevas was placed under arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Cuevas was retrieving the cocaine from the blue Toyota, Rodriguez and Matos watched from the blue BMW. When Martinez and Cuevas left the Kowloon parking lot, Rodriguez and Matos pulled onto the highway and followed them.  They were followed by agents in the same surveillance van that had drawn the attention of Rodriguez and Matos earlier that morning.  Rodriguez and Matos drove north for a distance and then reversed direction.  After driving south a short distance, they pulled over to the side of the road and allowed the surveillance van to pass them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the van passed them, Agent Geibel, the van's driver, pulled the van into a parking lot and parked there.  A short time later, Rodriguez and Matos drove by the lot slowly, looking at the van as they passed.  Instead of continuing, however, Rodriguez and Matos pulled into the parking lot of a gas station, where they waited for about five minutes.  When Rodriguez and Matos exited the station parking lot, Agent Geibel also pulled out and followed them.  Geibel then followed them into the parking lot of a Sears store.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After parking their car, Rodriguez and Matos entered the Sears store through the front entrance.  A few minutes later, they exited the building through the rear entrance.  As the two men were walking along the side of the building, Rodriguez and Matos again looked at the surveillance van.  Rather than returning to their car, they reentered the store through a side entrance.  A few minutes later, they exited the store from the front, and Rodriguez walked to a nearby public telephone.  Rodriguez was then arrested.  According to the cellular telephone records obtained for Torres' cellular telephone, Torres placed a page to Rodriguez at or about the time that Rodriguez walked to the payphone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Rodriguez was being arrested, Matos turned and ran back to the store.  After a brief chase, he was apprehended and arrested.  At the time of the arrest, Matos had the registration for the blue Toyota station wagon, from which Cuevas had retrieved the cocaine, in his possession.  Later that afternoon, Torres was placed under arrest near his home in Chelsea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Search of Rodriguez' Storage Unit</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the early evening hours of that same day, January 17, 1992, agents applied for and obtained a search warrant to search the storage unit at North Shore Storage rented by Rodriguez.  Torres had a key to this unit, along with keys to the brown Cadillac, in his possession at the time of his arrest.  Rodriguez also had a key to this storage unit on his key ring at the time of his arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The searching agents found a 1988 Ford Taurus car with New York license plates in the storage unit.  Under the front seat of the car, agents found National Car Rental documents dated January 11, 1992 in Cuevas' name.  A search of the trunk area of the car revealed a secret compartment and two kilograms of cocaine.  The search of Rodriguez' self-storage unit also produced a triple- beam scale, various packaging materials and a safe.  When the safe was opened a few days later, agents discovered another kilogram of cocaine and more packaging materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Prior Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 30, 1992, a grand jury returned a five-count indictment against Cuevas, Torres, Rodriguez, Matos, and Thomas.  Count One charged all six with participating in a conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute.  Counts Two through Five of the indictment contained substantive distribution charges relating to the four undercover cocaine purchases.  Cuevas and Thomas were named as defendants in Counts Two, Three, and Four.  Cuevas, Torres, Rodriguez and Matos were named as defendants in Count Five, regarding the ten kilogram transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a trial, a jury returned guilty verdicts against all defendants on all counts.  Rodriguez, Matos and Thomas were sentenced on December 8, 1992.  The district court sentenced Thomas to 70 months' imprisonment.  Based on their participation in the ten kilogram transaction of January 17, 1992, Rodriguez and Matos each received ten-year, mandatory minimum sentences.  The district court sentenced Cuevas to 235 months' imprisonment, and Torres to 210-months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>ANALYSIS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Denial of Torres' Motion for Severance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several months prior to trial, Torres filed a motion for severance under Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 14, arguing that his case should be severed because \"one or more co-defendants has given or would give exculpatory testimony or evidence in his behalf if called as a witness at trial.\"  His motion was unaccompanied by affidavit or other evidence of such a witness.  Torres did, however, submit an affidavit from Cuevas with a markedly different version of the events of January 17, 1992.  Although Cuevas' affidavit attempted to exculpate Torres, nothing in the affidavit indicated whether he would actually testify on Torres' behalf.  The district court rejected Torres' motion for severance, holding that Torres had not met his burden under United States v. Drougas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"444351\"><a href=\"/opinion/444351/united-states-v-aristedes-drougas-united-states-of-america-v-michael-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir. 1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately prior to jury selection for his trial, Torres filed a Supplemental Motion for Severance, arguing that severance was required on two grounds.  First, he contended, a severance was required due to \"prejudicial spillover.\"  Second, Torres contended that a separate trial was required in order to make Cuevas' exculpatory testimony available to him.  In his motion, Torres admitted that Cuevas' attorney had recently advised Torres' counsel that Cuevas would not testify on Torres' behalf at a separate trial.  However, according to Torres, Cuevas had personally indicated to him that he would testify for Torres at a separate trial.  Torres again failed, however, to produce any affidavits supporting this assertion.  Torres requested that the court ask Cuevas directly of his intentions.  Cuevas' counsel objected to such a procedure.  The district court then declined to question Cuevas directly, found that the basis for Torres' severance motion was \"entirely too speculative\" and denied the motion.  Torres now challenges the district court's denial of his motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that \"[a] motion for severance is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and we review only for a manifest abuse of discretion resulting in a miscarriage of justice.\"  United States v.

Under the Drougas test, in order to be entitled to a severance on the basis of a codefendant's testimony, the movant must demonstrate 1) a bona fide need for the testimony;  2) the substance of the testimony;  3) its exculpatory nature and effect;  and 4) that the codefendant will in fact testify if the cases are severed.  A court reviewing such a motion should 1) examine the significance of the testimony in relation to the defendant's defense theory;  2) consider whether the testimony would be subject to substantial, damaging impeachment;  3) assess the counter-arguments of judicial economy;  and 4) give weight to the timeliness of the motion.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"444351\"><a href=\"/opinion/444351/united-states-v-aristedes-drougas-united-states-of-america-v-michael-a/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 19.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres did not meet the fourth prong of the Drougas test-i.e., he did not sufficiently establish that Cuevas would indeed testify in a separate trial.  Torres insists that Cuevas had repeatedly assured him that he would testify in his behalf, yet Torres did not submit any affidavits, either his own or Cuevas', in support of these assurances.  More importantly, Cuevas' attorney told Torres and the district court specifically that Cuevas would not testify.  Torres concedes now that \"some doubt remained\" as to whether Cuevas would actually testify at a separate trial.  He argues, however, that given this doubt, the district court should have asked Cuevas directly over counsel's objection whether he would testify at a separate trial on Torres' behalf, and that the court's failure to ask this \"single, clarifying question\" of Cuevas \"crippled\" Torres' defense and constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that an allegation that a codefendant may testify, without more, is insufficient to entitle a defendant to severance.

Given the complete lack of either factual or legal support for Torres' request, it is clear to us that the district court's refusal to interrogate Cuevas directly was entirely reasonable and within its broad discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  This lack of evidence also leads us to the inescapable conclusion that the district court properly applied the Drougas test and denied Torres' severance motion on this ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

Perkins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556607\"><a href=\"/opinion/556607/united-states-v-patrick-perkins-united-states-of-america-v-lois-perkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span>, 1281 (1st Cir. 1991).  We have explained, however, that where evidence featuring one defendant is independently admissible against a codefendant, the latter cannot convincingly complain of an improper spillover.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610896\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">O'Bryant,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/610896/united-states-v-david-s-obryant/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>.  Furthermore, the existence of stronger evidence against codefendants does not necessarily entitle a defendant to automatic severance, nor does a defendant's relatively minor conspiratorial role normally preclude a joint trial with more prominent codefendants.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195118\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Welch,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195118/united-states-v-welch/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1210</span></a></span>.  Thus, when multiple defendants are named in a single indictment, a defendant who seeks severance will succeed only by making a \"strong showing of evident prejudice.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610896\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">O'Bryant,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/610896/united-states-v-david-s-obryant/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>.  Even where large amounts of evidence are irrelevant to one defendant, or where one defendant's involvement in an overall conspiracy is far less than that of others, a reviewing court must be reluctant to second-guess severance denials.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610896\"><a href=\"/opinion/610896/united-states-v-david-s-obryant/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 26.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his \"spillover\" claim, Torres contends that the government's trial evidence actually proved two conspiracies, not one, as charged in the indictment.  Torres maintains that the evidence proved one conspiracy involving Thomas and Cuevas that produced the three early cocaine transactions.  He contends that the evidence then established a second conspiracy involving Cuevas, Rodriguez, Matos and himself to deliver the ten kilograms of cocaine on January 17, 1992.  Torres argues that he was unfairly prejudiced by the evidence of the three smaller cocaine transactions among Agent Martinez and defendants Thomas and Cuevas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres' defense counsel raised this objection repeatedly during trial, and the district court carefully instructed the jury with respect to the issue of multiple conspiracies.  Torres did not object to this aspect of the district court's jury charge, and does not challenge it here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any case, the evidence strongly indicates that Torres was much more than a one-day, one-time conspirator, as he now avers.  During his conversations with Agent Martinez, defendant Cuevas repeatedly stated that he needed to confer with his \"partner.\"  When introducing Torres, he referred to him as his \"socio,\" or associate.  Immediately before and after one of his meetings with Martinez negotiating a multi-kilogram transaction, Cuevas called Torres on his cellular telephone.  The evidence also shows an ongoing relationship between Torres and Rodriguez, and that Rodriguez was responding to Torres' page at the time of his arrest.  We think that this evidence all fairly supports the reasonable inference that Torres was Cuevas' partner in an ongoing drug conspiracy, which included the three smaller transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most importantly, the evidence introduced at trial firmly supports Torres' conviction for participating in a single conspiracy to distribute ten kilograms of cocaine on January 17, 1992.  In fact, the evidence indicates that Torres had an influential, even leading, role in the conspiracy.  He went with Cuevas in the morning to the storage facility where the cocaine was presumably stored;  he actively participated in the discussions with Agent Martinez, suggesting the place and mechanics of the transaction;  and he stated that he had another smaller delivery that day.  Torres has not indicated how he was prejudiced by any alleged \"spillover,\" and in light of all the evidence against him, we do not see any prejudice.  Accordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of his motion to sever.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).  In particular, Torres challenges the admission of the statements made by Thomas to Agent Martinez during a recorded conversation on October 18, 1991.  Torres claims that the statement should have been excluded because 1) United States v. Petrozziello, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"342283\"><a href=\"/opinion/342283/united-states-v-ralph-petrozziello/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1977), requires that the government have independent evidence that the defendant was a member of the conspiracy at the time the co-conspirator statement was made;  2) there was no significant evidence linking Torres to the conspiracy other than the challenged statement;  and 3) the statement prejudiced him by \"possibly rais[ing] an inference that Torres had any knowledge of or connection to the drug trafficking activities of Thomas and Cuevas before January 17, 1992.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The test for admissibility of a coconspirator statement under Fed.  R.

United States v.

Once found to be a member of a conspiracy, a defendant is subject to proof of the prior acts and comments of his co-conspirators, even if those comments were made prior to the defendant's involvement in the conspiracy.  United States v.

In the instant case, the district court conducted a Petrozziello hearing at the close of all the evidence, and concluded, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a single conspiracy existed and that Torres was a participant.  Nothing more was required under our precedents to render the statements of co-conspirators Thomas and Cuevas admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).  In light of the ample evidence, discussed above, of the existence of a conspiracy and Torres' influential participation in it, we cannot say that the district court's Petrozziello rulings were clearly erroneous.  We therefore affirm Torres' conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

Essentially, Matos claims that his arrest at the Sears store on January 17, 1992 was based on a mere hunch or subjective suspicion by the arresting agents that Matos and Rodriguez were conducting \"counter- surveillance\" for Cuevas' cocaine transaction.  In a written memorandum and order, the district court denied Matos' motion, concluding that his arrest was supported by probable cause.  The district court reviewed Matos' activities prior to his arrest, and noted that \"[t]he fact that Matos fled adds weight to the determination of probable cause, but is not necessary to that determination.\"  Matos now claims that we must find that the district court's denial of his suppression motion constituted reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's findings of fact on a motion to suppress are reviewable only for clear error as to probable cause, and questions of law remain subject to de novo review.

It was Rodriguez' storage unit that Cuevas and Torres accessed on the morning of January 17, 1992, a fact that the agents knew during their surveillance of Matos and Rodriguez that afternoon.  The agents also had a reasonable suspicion that it had been Matos and Rodriguez in the blue Toyota station wagon who met with Torres and Cuevas at the storage facility that morning.  The activities of Matos and Rodriguez that afternoon support a reasonable inference that they were closely involved in the delivery of ten kilograms of cocaine to Martinez on January 17, 1992.  Their behavior and carefully synchronized movements strongly support the agents' theory that they were in charge of counter-surveillance for the transaction.  We therefore find that the district court correctly denied Matos' motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. Denial of Matos' and Rodriguez' Motions for Entry of Judgments of Acquittal</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Matos and Rodriguez challenge the district court's denial of their motions for judgments of acquittal.  Matos contends that his \"mere presence\" at the scene of a crime is the only evidence of his membership in the conspiracy, and therefore that his conviction cannot stand.  Rodriguez likewise contends that no evidence of his membership in the conspiracy exists, or that he violated any laws, and that the government's case against him is based solely on conjecture and speculative inference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, we assess the sufficiency of the evidence as a whole in the light most favorable to the verdict, with a view to whether a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  We do not weigh witness credibility, but resolve all credibility issues in favor of the verdict.  United States v. Hahn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195236\"><a href=\"/opinion/195236/united-states-v-hahn/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, 506 (1st Cir. 1994).  The evidence may be entirely circumstantial, and need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.  In other words, the factfinder may decide among reasonable interpretations of the evidence.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the evidence according to these principles, we think it clear that the convictions of both Matos and Rodriguez were amply supported by the evidence.  Both of these appellants' challenges rest on the testimony offered by Rodriguez at trial.  Rodriguez testified at trial that he had rented a storage unit at North Shore Self Storage with Cuevas for the purpose of repairing a car.  According to Rodriguez, he returned his keys and paperwork to Cuevas and did not return to the storage unit after December 19, 1991.  Rodriguez also denied driving to the storage unit on the morning of January 17, 1992, denied returning to the Weylu's parking lot, denied running from the restaurant to his BMW with Matos, and denied following Martinez and Cuevas to the Kowloon restaurant.  Rodriguez claimed that his only contact with Cuevas on that day was to drive him to Weylu's, after which he and Matos proceeded to Sears to go shopping.  Rodriguez also denied that he was responding to a page from Torres when he was arrested, despite the records indicating that just moments before his arrest he had been paged by Torres.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clearly, the jury rejected Rodriguez' testimony, no doubt in light of the evidence to the contrary.  As discussed above, the government proved through strong circumstantial evidence that Rodriguez and Matos were closely involved with Cuevas in the ten kilogram transaction.  The jury was entitled to draw reasonable inferences from this evidence, and to reject Rodriguez' testimony in whole or in part.  We therefore find that the evidence adduced at trial supports the jury's guilty verdict, and that the district court properly denied the defendants' motions for judgments of acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">F.

Torres, Rodriguez and Matos each challenge the drug quantity determinations made by the district court during sentencing.  Torres claims that the district court committed clear error by attributing to him two kilograms of cocaine discovered in a second storage unit at North Shore Self Storage.  Consequently, Torres argues, his Base Offense Level under the Sentencing Guidelines should have been 32 (5-15 kilograms of cocaine) rather than level 34 (15-50 kilograms of cocaine), as determined by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez and Matos also claim that the district court committed clear error in finding that a drug quantity of at least five kilograms of cocaine was reasonably foreseeable to them as a consequence of their participation in the ten kilogram transaction of January 17, 1992.  Accordingly, Rodriguez and Matos both claim that their ten-year mandatory minimum sentences must be vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well settled that \"[a] narcotics conspirator is responsible not only for the drugs he actually handled or saw but also for the full quantity of drugs that he reasonably could have foreseen to be embraced by the conspiracy he joined.\"  United States v.

We also defer to the sentencing court's credibility determinations.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The district court's drug quantity determination as to Torres</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found Torres responsible for the ten kilograms involved in the January 17, 1992 transaction;  three kilograms found in Rodriguez' storage unit;  and two kilograms found in another storage unit belonging to Mariquesa Cuevas.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The district court based its sentencing determinations on its factual finding that Torres was \"very much involved\" in \"what was going on out at the storage location,\" and that the evidence regarding his participation in the cocaine distribution scheme with Cuevas was compelling.  The district court concluded, based on these findings, that Torres was \"involved and accountable\" for the five kilograms found in the two units at North Shore Self Storage.  Torres now argues that no evidence links him to Mariquesa Cuevas' storage unit or to the two kilograms of cocaine found therein.  He contends that the sentencing court had to engage in speculative and impermissible leaps of logic in order to attribute these two kilograms to him, and his sentence must therefore be vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant facts relied upon by the district court during sentencing but not introduced into evidence at trial are as follows.  During the afternoon of January 17, 1992, after Cuevas had been arrested, his sister Mariquesa attempted to enter North Shore Self Storage.  She was driving Cuevas' gold Honda Accord, a car that Cuevas had driven to one of his meetings with Agent Martinez.  Mariquesa Cuevas was stopped by a state trooper before she could enter the storage facility premises.  The officer observed a large amount of cash on the back seat of the Honda.  When asked about the money, Mariquesa Cuevas said that she knew nothing about it, and that the car belonged to her brother.  The car, the money (approximately $7,000) and the car keys were then seized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that evening, agents obtained and executed a search warrant for a storage unit leased in the name of Mariquesa Cuevas, as well as the unit leased in Rodriguez' name.  Two kilograms of cocaine were recovered from Mariquesa Cuevas' unit.  Agents later determined that one of the keys on the gold Honda's key ring fit the lock to Mariquesa Cuevas' storage unit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court evidently found Torres responsible at sentencing for these two kilograms because of the ample circumstantial evidence of his close, influential association with Cuevas, and the fact that Torres had the key to Rodriguez' storage unit in which three kilograms of cocaine were found.  Despite Torres' protestations at sentencing, the court faced a sizeable quantity of evidence that Torres exerted a significant, even a leading, role in a cocaine distribution conspiracy, and that use of the storage units at North Shore Self Storage was part of the conspiracy's mechanics.  Therefore, even if Torres did not know specifically about the two kilograms in Mariquesa Cuevas' storage unit, the district court acted well within the bounds of its discretion in concluding, based on its factual findings, that Torres could have reasonably foreseen that any additional cocaine found in the storage unit would be deemed \"embraced\" by the overall conspiracy.  Torres fails to point to any competent evidence that contradicts the district court's findings and conclusions, other than his own testimony.  Because the district court was entitled to disbelieve Torres' testimony, and because we cannot say that the court's findings of fact and conclusions were clearly erroneous, we reject Torres' challenge and affirm his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The district court's drug quantity calculations as to Rodr iguez and Matos</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez and Matos also argue that the ten kilograms of cocaine delivered to Agent Martinez on January 17, 1992 should not have been attributed to them.  They contend that the government failed to establish that they had the requisite knowledge of the the amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy.  Accordingly, they argue, the ten-year mandatory minimum penalty prescribed by 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(A)(ii), applicable to conspiracies involving five or more kilograms of cocaine, does not apply to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In rejecting this argument at sentencing and ruling that the ten-year mandatory minimum did indeed apply, the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Rodriguez and Matos joined Cuevas and Torres in the morning of January 17, 1992 to pick up the ten kilograms of cocaine from the storage facility to sell to Agent Martinez.  The evidence adduced at trial, moreover, also indicates that it was Rodriguez and Matos who, at Cuevas' instruction, moved the ten kilograms of cocaine from Weylu's restaurant to the Kowloon restaurant later that day.  When Rodriguez' storage unit was searched that evening, a car with a secret compartment and three kilograms of cocaine were found.  Rodriguez had a key to this unit at the time of his arrest.  In light of all of this evidence and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom, we cannot say that the district court committed clear error in finding that a drug quantity of at least five kilograms was reasonably foreseeable to both Rodriguez and Matos.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously explained that \"[a] defendant who conspires to transport for distribution a large quantity of drugs, but happens not to know the precise amount, pretty much takes his chances that the amount involved will be quite large.\"  De La <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610551\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Cruz,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/610551/united-states-v-efrain-de-la-cruz-united-states-v-luis-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1314</span></a></span>.  We see no reason or special circumstances here to justify a departure from our prior ruling.
