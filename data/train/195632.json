In our  earlier\n                                          \n\ndisposition  of  this  appeal1,  we disposed  of  all  claims\n\nexcept appellant's claim against  the town of Lakeville under\n\nthe  Massachusetts Tort  Claims Act,  Mass. Gen.  L. ch.  258\n\n(Count  IV).   We  retained appellate  jurisdiction over  the\n\nlatter  claim  against Lakeville  pending  an  answer to  the\n\nfollowing question, which  we certified to the  Massachusetts\n\nSupreme Judicial Court pursuant to its Rule 1:03:\n\n     Do the discretionary decisions of a police  officer\n     to begin  and continue the high-speed  pursuit of a\n     vehicle then  being operated  in  violation of  law\n     involve  policymaking or  planning for  purposes of\n     immunity under Massachusetts General Law ch. 258,  \n     10(b)?\n\n          The  Massachusetts  court  has  now  answered  that\n\nquestion  in the negative.  Horta v. Sullivan, 418 Mass. 615,\n                                             \n\n615 (1994).  Accordingly, Mennino's actions were not entitled\n\nto immunity under   10(b),  and the district court's granting\n\nof summary judgment  on Count  IV in favor  of Lakeville  was\n\nimproper.2   Horta v. Sullivan, 4 F.3d 2, 24 (1st Cir. 1993).\n                              \n\n                    \n\n1.   Horta v. Sullivan, 4 F.3d 2 (1st Cir. 1993).\n                      \n\n2.  Although  for other  reasons we  earlier vacated  summary\njudgment  on appellants'  claim  against Freetown  under  the\nMassachusetts Tort  Claims  Act, Horta,  4  F.3d at  25,  the\n                                      \nanswer  of the  Massachusetts Supreme  Judicial Court  to our\ncertified question  appears germane to that claim as well, as\nwe  thought might be the  case.  Id.   Since that claim is no\n                                    \nlonger before us, however, we do not address it at this time,\nbut  leave to the parties  and the district  court any action\nthat may be appropriate in light of the Massachusetts court's\nopinion.\n\n                             -2-\n\nWe therefore vacate summary judgment on this claim and remand\n\nto the district court for further proceedings consistent with\n\nour  opinion  herein and  the  opinion  of the  Massachusetts\n\nSupreme Judicial Court.  We note that while our certification\n\nwas  pending  before  the   Massachusetts  high  court,   the\n\nMassachusetts  state  legislature  amended the  Massachusetts\n\nTort Claims Act.   See  Act approved January  14, 1994,  1993\n                      \n\nMass.  Legis. Serv. ch. 495,     57, 144  (H.B. 5620) (West).\n\nThe  Supreme  Judicial  Court  did  not  rule  on  how  these\n\namendments might affect Horta's  claim, if at all,  since the\n\nissue was not before it.   See Horta, 418 Mass. at  622 n.14.\n                                    \n\nWe similarly do not reach this issue, but anticipate that the\n\ndistrict court, if  called on to do so by one  or more of the\n\nparties, will rule on the  materiality of these amendments to\n\nthe pending  claim and will  factor the  amendments into  its\n\nfinal outcome if and to the extent appropriate.\n\n          Count IV is vacated and remanded.\n                                          \n\n                             -3-\n",
