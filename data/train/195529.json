This  action  involves  a\n                                    \n\nretaliatory discharge claim  under Title VII of  the Civil Rights\n\nAct  of 1964, 42 U.S.C.    2000(e)-2.  Plaintiff-Appellant, Donna\n\nHoeppner, alleges that she was fired because she reported several\n\nincidents  of sexual harassment  to her  employer.   The district\n\ncourt granted  summary judgment  in favor of  Hoeppner's employer\n\nand we affirm.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Defendant-Appellee,  Crotched  Mountain  Rehabilitation\n\nCenter, Inc. (\"CMRC\"), is a nonprofit school for the  instruction\n\nand rehabilitation  of  multiply handicapped  children and  young\n\nadults.   Hoeppner was employed as a special education teacher at\n\nCMRC from September 1989 until November 9, 1990.  Hoeppner was in\n\ncharge  of a  classroom  at the  school  throughout her  term  of\n\nemployment.  She was aided by several teacher assistants (\"TAs\"),\n\nwho normally rotated through different classrooms over periods of\n\nthree to six months. \n\n          Beginning  in December of  1989, several TAs complained\n\nto  CMRC  administrators  about  Hoeppner's  management  of   her\n\nclassroom and  about  Hoeppner's  poor  communication  with,  and\n\nsupervision  of, the  TAs.   Hoeppner  contests the  validity and\n\ngenuineness  of  some  of  these complaints,  and  questions  the\n\nexistence  of others, but  does not dispute  that some complaints\n\nwere  made about  her prior  to her  discharge and  prior  to her\n\nreport of sexual harassment.  There is also  no dispute that CMRC\n\nplaced Hoeppner on probation  for ninety days in August  of 1990.\n\n                               -2-\n\nSubsequently,  on November  1,  1990,  Hoeppner reported  several\n\nincidents of sexual harassment by one of her TAs.  On November 9,\n\n1990, three days after the expiration of her probationary period,\n\nCMRC  discharged  Hoeppner  on   the  ground  that  Hoeppner  had\n\nallegedly failed to make  suggested improvements in her classroom\n\nduring  the probationary  period.   Hoeppner maintains  that this\n\nground is merely  a pretext  for the real  reason underlying  her\n\ntermination:  Hoeppner's report of sexual harassment.   Before we\n\naddress whether this allegation  can survive summary judgment, we\n\nbriefly  recount the  evidence  concerning these  events in  more\n\ndetail.\n\n          CMRC's  Principal,  Barbara  Cohen, and  its  Assistant\n\nPrincipal,  Archibald  Campbell, state  in  affidavits that  they\n\nreceived complaints about Hoeppner's supervision of her classroom\n\non  several occasions.  Cohen  attests that in  December of 1989,\n\nshe met with Hoeppner's  TAs to discuss problems between  the TAs\n\nand Hoeppner.  Cohen claims that TAs Diana V lez and Jennifer Roy\n\ncomplained  to her in January about the way Hoeppner was treating\n\nthem in the classroom.\n\n          A meeting between  Hoeppner, Cohen, and  Hoeppner's TAs\n\nwas held on January 20, 1990.   Cohen maintains that the  meeting\n\nwas specifically scheduled for the purpose of discussing the TAs'\n\nconcerns about Hoeppner.  In her affidavit,  Hoeppner claims that\n\nthe  meeting was  a routine  afterschool discussion  of classroom\n\nmatters at which Cohen  solicited corrective suggestions from the\n\nTAs.   Even  according to  Hoeppner's  account, however,  the TAs\n\n                               -3-\n\n\"talked basically at me\" and TA V lez stated at the meeting  that\n\nHoeppner was not providing V lez with sufficient feedback.\n\n          Hoeppner's first performance  evaluation for the period\n\nof  September 11, 1989, through  December 11, 1989, was completed\n\non February  12, 1990.  Cohen met with Hoeppner on February 24 to\n\ndiscuss the evaluation.   The evaluation rated Hoeppner's overall\n\nperformance  as  fully  satisfactory, although  it  noted several\n\nproblems  with  her  classroom  management abilities.    Under  a\n\ncategory entitled  \"Developing and Motivating  Subordinates,\" for\n\nexample,   the  evaluation   stated  that   Hoeppner's  \"personal\n\nrelationships with  teacher  assistants have  been strained\"  and\n\nthat  Hoeppner needed  to be  more  open to  input from  the TAs.\n\nHoeppner signed  the evaluation and remembers  discussing it with\n\nCohen.   She alleges,  however, that  the negative  comments were\n\nuntrue and fabricated.\n\n          Meanwhile, Assistant Principal Campbell claims that TAs\n\nHeidi Beetcher and  James LaBelle complained sometime in  July of\n\n1990  about the  way Hoeppner  was treating  them.   Campbell and\n\nCohen subsequently  scheduled a  meeting  for July  31, 1990,  to\n\ndiscuss the problems.   Sometime prior to  this meeting, Hoeppner\n\nalleges that she reported both Beetcher and LaBelle to CMRC for a\n\nvariety  of inappropriate  conduct, including  physical abuse  of\n\nstudents, administering unauthorized medications, and tardiness.\n\n          The July  31 meeting  was attended by  Cohen, Campbell,\n\nHoeppner, and TAs Beetcher and LaBelle.  Cohen wrote an extensive\n\nmemorandum  documenting her  version  of the  various  complaints\n\n                               -4-\n\nabout  Hoeppner that were raised at the meeting.  Cohen concluded\n\nin the  memorandum that Hoeppner \"had  repeated problems properly\n\nsupervising and communicating with her staff.  . . .  As a result\n\n. .  . her performance as a teacher and as a classroom supervisor\n\nis inadequate.\"  Hoeppner does not dispute Cohen's account of the\n\nmeeting,  nor   does  she  dispute  that   Beetcher  and  LaBelle\n\ncomplained  about  her supervision  of  the  classroom.   Rather,\n\nHoeppner  alleges  that  Beetcher and  LaBelle  fabricated  their\n\ncomplaints in  retaliation for Hoeppner's prior  act of reporting\n\nthe  two TAs  to CMRC administrators  for misconduct  and abusing\n\nstudents.\n\n          CMRC placed  Hoeppner on  probation on August  8, 1990.\n\nCohen  met with Hoeppner the next day  to discuss the reasons for\n\nthe  probation and the  applicable terms and  consequences of the\n\nninety-day probationary period.   At the meeting, Cohen presented\n\nHoeppner  with the  \"Disciplinary  Action  Form\" documenting  the\n\nprobation.   The  form states  that  the probation  resulted from\n\nHoeppner's failure to properly supervise and communicate with her\n\nTAs.   The form  also  listed five  changes involving  Hoeppner's\n\nclassroom management practices that \"must be made\" by Hoeppner to\n\nimprove her  behavior.  The  form concluded  with the  statement:\n\n\"If  behavior  does  not  improve,  further  disciplinary  action\n\nmay/will be taken:   Up to and including termination.\"   Hoeppner\n\nsigned  the form  but did  not write  anything in  the  space for\n\nemployee  comments.   Hoeppner  objects  to the  validity  of the\n\nassertions contained in the form and alleges that CMRC placed her\n\n                               -5-\n\non probation as a threat to stop Hoeppner from reporting abuse of\n\nstudents and otherwise \"making waves\" at the school.\n\n          Cohen   states  in   her   affidavit  that   Hoeppner's\n\nperformance did not  improve during the probationary period.  She\n\nstates  that another TA,  Pam Flannery,  complained to  her about\n\nHoeppner's classroom management  and supervision on  October, 31,\n\n1990.   Flannery signed a statement containing the details of her\n\ncomplaints,  including  allegations   that  Hoeppner's   intimate\n\nrelationship  with another  one  of her  TAs,  Glenn Loucks,  now\n\nespoused  to  Hoeppner, was  causing  trouble  in the  classroom.\n\nCohen states  that Flannery indicated  that the classroom  was in\n\nchaos.   Hoeppner claims  that the CMRC  administration solicited\n\nFlannery's  statement while  it was  pressuring Flannery  to stay\n\naway from the union which Glenn Loucks and  others were trying to\n\norganize at  CMRC.   Hoeppner alleges  that  Flannery signed  the\n\nstatement to  save her job and  the statement is thus  of dubious\n\nvalidity.   Mark Pierce,  a Residential Counselor  at CMRC, makes\n\nthe same allegation as Hoeppner in his affidavit.1\n\n          Meanwhile,  CMRC  Education  Staff  Development  Chair,\n\nPamela  Shea, states in an affidavit that she spoke with Hoeppner\n\n                    \n\n1    According to  Hoeppner,  Flannery's  statement is  allegedly\ncontradicted by a  subsequent October 9, 1992  letter by Flannery\ndenying  that  the alleged  incidents  of  sexual harassment  had\noccurred  in  Hoeppner's classroom.    In the  October  9 letter,\nFlannery  does state that \"we  all worked very  well together\" in\nthe classroom, however, she  also states in the same  letter that\nthe  relationship  between  Loucks  and  Hoeppner   \"was  causing\nfriction  and  tension  in  [Hoeppner's]  staff.\"    We   see  no\ncontradiction   between  Flannery's  signed   statement  and  her\nsubsequent letter.\n\n                               -6-\n\nin early November (Cohen indicates that Shea informed her of this\n\nconversation on November 1) and  determined that the situation in\n\nHoeppner's classroom was chaotic and out of control.\n\n          On  November 1, 1990,  Hoeppner first  reported several\n\nincidents  of  sexual  harassment  to CMRC.    Hoeppner  informed\n\nAssistant Principal Campbell that  one of her TAs, Shane  Waters,\n\nhad  made several  sexually inappropriate  overtures  toward her,\n\nincluding touching  her breasts  from behind, placing  his crotch\n\nthree inches  from her face, and rubbing  her back.  Campbell and\n\nCohen spoke  with Waters on several occasions  between November 2\n\nand November 5, 1992.   Waters gave a somewhat  different account\n\nof the incidents and  denied that any  of his actions had  sexual\n\nconnotations.    Campbell  and  Cohen  told  Waters  that  sexual\n\nharassment was  not  acceptable and  that  Waters should  not  do\n\nanything  that  could  be   interpreted  by  Hoeppner  as  sexual\n\nharassment.   Neither Cohen nor Campbell  took any administrative\n\naction  against   Waters  nor   did  they  conduct   any  further\n\ninvestigation of  the  incident beyond  their conversations  with\n\nWaters.     Hoeppner  claims   that  despite  promising   a  full\n\ninvestigation,  the  CMRC administration  did  nothing and  never\n\ninformed  her of  what they  would  do, or  had  done, about  the\n\nincidents.\n\n          CMRC  discharged Hoeppner  on November  9, 1990,  three\n\ndays after her probationary period ended and eight days after she\n\nreported the incidents  of sexual harassment.   According to  the\n\nfinal  performance evaluation  written  by Cohen  upon Hoeppner's\n\n                               -7-\n\ndischarge, Hoeppner continued to have problems with her staff and\n\ndid not improve her supervision  and management of the classroom,\n\nas  required by the terms of Hoeppner's probation.  In deposition\n\ntestimony,  Hoeppner stated that she  did not change her behavior\n\nin   response  to  the   criticisms  leveled  by   Cohen  in  the\n\nDisciplinary  Action  Form   accompanying  Hoeppner's   probation\n\nbecause Hoeppner did  not feel  that the  criticisms were  valid.\n\nHoeppner  does  claim, however,  that  she  did  make changes  in\n\nresponse to the particular  needs of individual TAs and  that, in\n\ngeneral, she did improve her performance.\n\n          Hoeppner  maintains  that  there  were  no  significant\n\nproblems in  her classroom and  asserts that  the criticisms  and\n\ncomplaints against her were untrue and fabricated.  She proffered\n\naffidavits  of several current  and former employees  of CMRC who\n\nattest to Hoeppner's good  teaching and supervisory abilities and\n\nwho assert that Hoeppner did not have any problems with the staff\n\nin  her classroom.  Hoeppner also  points out that neither of her\n\nsupervisors,  Cohen and  Campbell,  formally observed  Hoeppner's\n\nwork  in  the  classroom.    CMRC's  motive  for  fabricating the\n\ncomplaints  against  her,  Hoeppner  claims,  was  to  implicitly\n\nthreaten  her job so that  Hoeppner would stop  \"making waves\" at\n\nCMRC by reporting  incidents of abuse  of students, by  reporting\n\nmisconduct of other employees, and  by supporting the efforts  to\n\norganize a union at  CMRC led by Glenn  Loucks.  Several  current\n\nand  past  employees assert  in  their affidavits  that  CMRC was\n\ntrying to  keep its  employees quiet about  incidents of  student\n\n                               -8-\n\nabuse  so that  the  incidents could  be  hidden from  the  state\n\nregulators and from  the public, thus avoiding  the tarnishing of\n\nCMRC's  reputation.   Several  affiants make  similar accusations\n\nregarding  CMRC's  efforts  to  discourage  unionization  at  the\n\nschool.   One  affiant claims  that  CMRC's method  of  silencing\n\nemployees  was  to  falsify  complaints  against  them  and  then\n\nthreaten to fire them.\n\n          The  district  court  rejected  Hoeppner's   claim  and\n\ndismissed  the  case on  summary judgment.    The court  found no\n\ntriable  issue  on  the   question  of  whether  CMRC  wrongfully\n\ndischarged  Hoeppner  because  CMRC  \"reasonably  and justifiably\n\nconcluded  that there  was a  problem in  plaintiff's classroom.\"\n\nThe court also  noted that the  complaints against Hoeppner  were\n\nmade well before she reported the incidents of sexual harassment,\n\nso these complaints could  not have been a fabricated  pretext to\n\ncover  up a retaliatory motive.  Consequently, the court found no\n\nevidence of a causal  relationship between the protected activity\n\nof reporting sexual harassment and Hoeppner's discharge.\n\n                          II.  ANALYSIS\n\n          To establish  a claim  of  retaliatory discharge  under\n\nTitle  VII, Hoeppner must show by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat:\n\n(1) she engaged  in a protected activity as  an employee, (2) she\n\nwas subsequently  discharged from employment, and (3) there was a\n\ncausal   connection  between  the   protected  activity  and  the\n\ndischarge.  Ramos v.  Roche Products, Inc., 936 F.2d  43, 48 (1st\n                                          \n\n                               -9-\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 112  S. Ct. 379 (1991); Ju rez  v. Ameritech\n                                                                 \n\nMobile Communications, Inc.,  957 F.2d 317, 321  (7th Cir. 1992).\n                           \n\nBecause reporting sexual harassment is a protected activity under\n\nTitle  VII, Morgan  v. Massachusetts  General Hospital,  901 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n186,  194 (1st Cir.  1990), and  because Hoeppner  was discharged\n\nafter she  reported the incidents of sexual harassment by Waters,\n\nthere is no dispute  that Hoeppner has established the  first two\n\nelements of her retaliatory discharge claim.  The issue on appeal\n\nis  whether, as  the  district court  found,  Hoeppner failed  to\n\npresent sufficient  evidence of a causal link  between her sexual\n\nharassment report and the subsequent discharge to defeat a motion\n\nfor summary  judgment.   To  put  it another  way,  the issue  is\n\nwhether  the evidence  in the  record can  show that  CMRC's true\n\nreason  or motive for  firing Hoeppner  was Hoeppner's  report of\n\nsexual harassment.\n\n          Because we are reviewing  an order of summary judgment,\n\nwe must determine whether  the pleadings, depositions, answers to\n\ninterrogatories and  affidavits offered  in this case,  viewed in\n\nthe light most  favorable to the  nonmovant, Hoeppner, present  a\n\ngenuine  issue of  material  fact regarding  the  existence of  a\n\ncausal connection between Hoeppner's sexual harassment report and\n\nher  subsequent discharge.

Even in discriminatory discharge  cases, where\n               \n\nthe plaintiff  can rarely present direct,  subjective evidence of\n\nan employer's actual motive, the plaintiff cannot survive summary\n\njudgment  with  \"unsupported allegations  and  speculations,\" but\n\nrather must \"point  to specific facts detailed  in affidavits and\n\ndepositions --  that is, names, dates,  incidents, and supporting\n\ntestimony  --  giving  rise  to an  inference  of  discriminatory\n\nanimus.\"  Lipsett v. University of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881, 895\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir. 1988).\n\n          Hoeppner claims on appeal that she presented sufficient\n\nevidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\n\nCMRC fabricated  the alleged complaints against  Hoeppner so that\n\nthey could be used  as a pretext for Hoeppner's  later discharge,\n\nwhich  was ultimately  caused  by the  sexual harassment  report.\n\nHoeppner  acknowledges that  the complaints  against her  and her\n\nsubsequent probation preceded her  report of sexual harassment to\n\nCMRC.  She argues, however,  that CMRC fabricated the  complaints\n\nand  placed  her on  probation in  order  to discourage  her from\n\nreporting  staff  abuse  of  students,  supporting Loucks'  union\n\nefforts,  and  otherwise \"making  waves\"  at  CMRC.   Instead  of\n\n                               -11-\n\nremaining silent,  Hoeppner ignored the implicit  threats by CMRC\n\nand reported her TA for sexual harassment.  As a result, Hoeppner\n\nconcludes, her sexual harassment  complaint, though maybe not the\n\nsole  reason  for her  discharge,  was a  \"significant  and final\n\nreason\" for her discharge.\n\n          Under  Hoeppner's  theory   of  the  causal  connection\n\nrequired  under Title VII, Hoeppner would not have been fired but\n\nfor  her  sexual  harassment  report because  she  defied  CMRC's\n\nimplicit  threats  to remain  quiet only  at  the point  when she\n\nreported the incidents  involving Waters.   Had she not  reported\n\nthe incidents of sexual harassment, Hoeppner maintains, she would\n\nnot have  been discharged because CMRC  administrators would have\n\nconcluded that Hoeppner had ceased to \"make waves\" in response to\n\ntheir threats against her.\n\n          Our review of the record convinces us that Hoeppner has\n\nfailed to present  sufficient evidence to  support her theory  of\n\nthe  causal  connection between  her  report  and her  subsequent\n\ndischarge.    Consequently, no  genuine  issue  of material  fact\n\nremains  for trial.    Hoeppner's \"evidence\"  consists mainly  of\n\nunsupported  allegations  without any  \"specific  facts\" such  as\n\n\"names, dates,  incidents, and  supporting testimony.\"   Lipsett,\n                                                                \n\n864 F.2d at  895.  Specific facts  are absent to support  several\n\ncrucial links along Hoeppner's alleged  chain of causality:   (1)\n\nthat CMRC  had a practice of implicitly threatening teachers with\n\nfabricated  negative teacher  evaluations  in order  to cover  up\n\nabuse  of students  at the  school; (2)  that CMRC's  practice of\n\n                               -12-\n\nsilencing teachers  to cover  up  student abuse  extended to  the\n\ngeneral practice of threatening  teachers who were \"making waves\"\n\nby  taking   actions  such  as  reporting   incidents  of  sexual\n\nharassment; and  (3) that CMRC's alleged  practice of threatening\n\nteachers through  fabricated  complaints was  instituted  against\n\nHoeppner herself,  resulting in  Hoeppner's  discharge after  she\n\nmade the sexual harassment  report.  Because all these  links are\n\ncrucial to the  third element  in Hoeppner's Title  VII cause  of\n\naction,  her failure  to  establish any  one  of them  dooms  her\n\nobjection to  CMRC's motion  for  summary judgment.   See,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nRamos,  936  F.2d at  49  (noting  that plaintiff's  \"accusations\n     \n\nremain   largely  conclusory   and   lacking  in   the   concrete\n\ndocumentation  necessary to  prove  the causal  link between  her\n\nprotected activity and her retaliatory treatment\").\n\n          1.  Regarding the first causal link, Hoeppner presented\n\nevidence showing that CMRC had problems with the mistreatment and\n\nabuse of students by staff members.  There is also some evidence,\n\nalthough  perhaps little  more than  a scintilla,  that CMRC  was\n\ntrying to hide the  incidents of abuse and mistreatment  from the\n\npublic,  either to  maintain  its reputation  or  to avoid  state\n\nregulators.    Hoeppner's  further  claim  that  CMRC  fabricated\n\ncomplaints against teachers  who reported abuse of students in an\n\neffort  to silence them,  however, is  supported by  nothing more\n\nthan unsubstantiated  allegations.   Hoeppner and Holly  Brown, a\n\nstaff psychologist at CMRC, both make assertions regarding CMRC's\n\nalleged  silencing practice  without  noting any  specific names,\n\n                               -13-\n\ndates  or incidents.  Glenn  Loucks claims in  his affidavit that\n\nsometime  in November  of 1990,  \"after attempting  to talk  to a\n\nsocial worker from the  state of Mass. for student  P.C., Barbara\n\nCohen told me that I would be fired for reporting  child abuse to\n\na state  agency.  That  I had  to follow [CMRC]  policy and  that\n\nmeant not  breaking client  confidentiality to any  state agency.\n\n[sic]\"  Loucks' statement might amount to some evidence of CMRC's\n\npractice of silencing  employees except for the fact  that Loucks\n\nstates in the next paragraph of his affidavit that he did in fact\n\nreport a case of child abuse  to the New Hampshire Department  of\n\nChildren and Youth  Service and yet he  makes no claim that  CMRC\n\ntook  any actions  against him  as a  result.   More importantly,\n\nLoucks'  allegation   does  not  support  the   claim  that  CMRC\n\nadministrators fabricated  complaints  against teachers  to  keep\n\nthem quiet.   He makes  no mention of  fabrication or threats  to\n\nfabricate complaints in his affidavit.\n\n          Dr. Robert Grassi, CMRC's Clinical  Director, states in\n\ndeposition testimony  that  CMRC's past  Director of  Psychology,\n\nMarilyn Russell, was discharged because she reported incidents of\n\nchild abuse  directly to state  authorities in violation  of CMRC\n\npolicy.    Although this  is the  type  of \"incident\"  that might\n\nnormally  raise  a triable  issue of  fact  as to  an established\n\npractice  of  CMRC,  the  practice  is  not  one  which  involves\n\nfabricating teacher complaints to implicitly threaten teachers to\n\nkeep  quiet.    No  allegations  are made  that  CMRC  fabricated\n\ncomplaints against Russell.  The problem with the \"evidence\" from\n\n                               -14-\n\nGrassi's  testimony is that it provides no details of the alleged\n\nretaliatory discharge of  Russell -- nor does  Hoeppner offer any\n\nevidence  from the  people  involved in  the incident,  including\n\nRussell  herself  -- that  would  enable  a  reasonable  jury  to\n\ndetermine if it is the type of occurrence that is consistent with\n\nthe  alleged  practice  by  CMRC to  fabricate  false  complaints\n\nagainst  teachers  to  prevent   them  from  reporting  abuse  of\n\nstudents.   Grassi himself does not explain how he discovered the\n\nreasons for Russell's discharge and,  indeed, states that he does\n\nnot  remember  talking about  these  reasons when  he  spoke with\n\nRussell at the time of the alleged incident.\n\n          2.   Even if Hoeppner had  provided sufficient evidence\n\nto show  that  CMRC  had a  practice  of  fabricating  complaints\n\nagainst teachers to discourage them from reporting student abuse,\n\nHoeppner has still failed  to establish a second crucial  link in\n\nthe  chain  connecting her  discharge  to  the sexual  harassment\n\nreport:   that CMRC's concern with staff reports of student abuse\n\nto outside  parties extended to a concern with the types of staff\n\nactions  that  Hoeppner  engaged  in,  such  as  filing  a sexual\n\nharassment report  and reporting two  of her TAs  for misconduct.\n\nIn  other  words,  Hoeppner  has  not  established  that she  did\n\nanything that  would cause  CMRC to fabricate  complaints against\n\nher.\n\n          Aside from  the incidents reported by  Hoeppner in this\n\ncase,  there is nothing in  the record regarding  any previous or\n\nsubsequent  complaints  of  sexual  harassment filed  by  a  CMRC\n\n                               -15-\n\nemployee,  or   regarding  CMRC's   retaliation,  or   threat  to\n\nretaliate,  against other  employees  who  might have  complained\n\nabout  sexual  harassment.    Thus,  Hoeppner  has  presented  no\n\nevidence that an internal  sexual harassment report would qualify\n\nas the type of conduct CMRC administrators would consider \"making\n\nwaves\" or the type of action that would induce CMRC to retaliate.\n\n          The closest thing to  \"evidence\" concerning this  issue\n\nis an affidavit by August Tardiff,  a teacher at CMRC, who claims\n\nthat in March of 1993, he reported to CMRC administrators that he\n\nfelt physically threatened  by one of his  TAs.  Although  the TA\n\nwas temporarily removed from  Tardiff's room, Tardiff claims that\n\nthe administrators \"refused to take my fears seriously [and] told\n\nme I did not  have a choice that I  had to work with this  man or\n\nleave.   They also  gave me a  disciplinary action  in which they\n\nblamed  me for the problem.  So I gave my resignation on April 12\n\nto be effective on  June 30th.\"  This single  incident, occurring\n\nnearly  three years after  Hoeppner was discharged,  would not by\n\nitself  allow a  reasonable  jury to  conclude  that CMRC  had  a\n\npractice of fabricating complaints against teachers who  reported\n\nsexual harassment at  the time Hoeppner  was fired.  To  defeat a\n\nmotion for summary judgment, \"[t]he mere existence of a scintilla\n\nof evidence  in  support  of the  plaintiff's  position  will  be\n\ninsufficient; there  must  be evidence  on which  the jury  could\n\nreasonably find for the  plaintiff.\"  Anderson v. Liberty  Lobby,\n                                                                 \n\nInc.,  477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986); see also Serrano-P rez, 985 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat  627; Milton  v. Van  Dorn Co.,  961 F.2d  965, 969  (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n                               -16-\n\n1992).   Tardiff's  incident is  too remote  and too  isolated to\n\ncreate  a triable issue as  to the fabrication  of the complaints\n\nagainst Hoeppner. \n\n          Hoeppner  has further failed  to provide  evidence that\n\nadministrators would consider any of  her other actions while  at\n\nCMRC as \"making waves,\"  such that the administrators would  have\n\ntaken retaliatory  action by  fabricating complaints and  placing\n\nHoeppner on  probation.   Hoeppner claims that  she reported  TAs\n\nBeetcher and LaBelle  for misconduct  in July of  1990.   Because\n\nthis  occurred after  several  TAs had  already complained  about\n\nHoeppner,  after   CMRC   wrote  Hoeppner's   first   performance\n\nevaluation  which mentioned  some of  the problems  in Hoeppner's\n\nclassroom,  and possibly  even after  Beetcher and  LaBelle first\n\ncomplained about Hoeppner to  Campbell, Hoeppner's actions  could\n\nnot have  led to  CMRC's fabrication  of  the initial  complaints\n\nagainst Hoeppner.\n\n          Hoeppner also makes the unsupported assertion that CMRC\n\nretaliated against  her because of her  relationship with Loucks,\n\nwho  was attempting  to organize  a union  at CMRC.   Several  of\n\nHoeppner's  supporting affidavits discuss incidents in which CMRC\n\nadministrators took actions to  discourage unionization or  union\n\nactivities.    However,  the  record contains  no  evidence  that\n\nHoeppner ever took part in union activities and nothing indicates\n\nthat CMRC thought she was involved with the union efforts.  Cohen\n\ndid know that  Hoeppner had an  intimate relationship with  Glenn\n\nLoucks, but nothing  in the  record indicates that  Cohen or  any\n\n                               -17-\n\nother  CMRC  administrator  imputed  Loucks'  union  activity  to\n\nHoeppner.    The record  is also  devoid  of any  indication that\n\nemployees' union activities were occurring before August of 1990,\n\nlet alone that CMRC knew about any union activities before August\n\nof 1990, when Hoeppner was put  on probation.  There is similarly\n\nno evidence  that Cohen or  anyone else  at CMRC  knew about  the\n\nrelationship between Loucks and  Cohen until the \"fall  of 1990,\"\n\nwell  after Hoeppner's  probation.   Thus, there  is insufficient\n\ncompetent evidence to raise  a genuine issue as to  whether anti-\n\nunion  animus  motivated  CMRC  to fabricate  complaints  against\n\nHoeppner.\n\n          In  sum, there  is insufficient  evidence from  which a\n\nreasonable  jury could find that CMRC had a practice of silencing\n\nemployees by fabricating false negative evaluations against them,\n\nthat  CMRC had  a practice  of retaliating against  teachers who,\n\nlike  Hoeppner,   made  reports  of  TA   misconduct  and  sexual\n\nharassment, or  that Hoeppner  herself engaged in  any activities\n\nthat would cause CMRC to fabricate the complaints against her and\n\nher  subsequent  probation.   Thus,  two  important causal  links\n\nnecessary  for her Title VII action are missing from the evidence\n\nin the record.\n\n          3.   Finally, Hoeppner has  failed to establish a third\n\ncrucial  link in the  causal chain  between Hoeppner's  report of\n\nsexual  harassment  and  her  discharge:    that  CMRC's  alleged\n\nsilencing practice was applied to Hoeppner  in this specific case\n\nthrough the fabrication of the complaints against her and through\n\n                               -18-\n\nthe subsequent  discharge of Hoeppner when she  continued to make\n\nwaves by reporting incidents of sexual harassment.\n\n          Hoeppner's evidence on this issue consists primarily of\n\naffidavits stating that Hoeppner was a good teacher, that she did\n\nnot have problems in  her classroom supervising, or communicating\n\nwith,  her TAs,  and  that the  TAs  themselves were  really  the\n\ntroublemakers  in Hoeppner's  classroom.    Hoeppner  wants  this\n\nevidence  to show that the  complaints against her  were not only\n\nuntruthful and inaccurate but  also fabricated.  As we  have held\n\non   previous   occasions,  \"evidence   contesting   the  factual\n\nunderpinnings  of  the  reasons  for  the  [employment  decision]\n\nproffered  by  the employer  is  insufficient,  without more,  to\n\npresent a jury question.\"  Morgan, 901 F.2d at 191 (citing Dea v.\n                                                              \n\nLook, 810  F.2d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1987)); see also Ramos, 936 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat  48.   Hoeppner  cannot  establish  that  CMRC's  reasons  for\n\ndischarging  her   were  merely   a  pretext   for  impermissible\n\nretaliation \"solely by contesting  the objective veracity of [the\n\nemployer's]  action.\"  Morgan, 901 F.2d at 191.  Rather, Hoeppner\n                             \n\nmust  provide  some  additional  evidence to  indicate  that  the\n\ncomplaints  were  purposefully  fabricated  with  the  intent  of\n\nthreatening Hoeppner not  to make  waves.  See  St. Mary's  Honor\n                                                                 \n\nCtr. v. Hicks, 113  S. Ct. 2742, 2751-52 (1993) (finding  that \"a\n             \n\nreason cannot  be  proved to  be 'a  pretext for  discrimination'\n\nunless  it is  shown both  that the  reason was  false,  and that\n\ndiscrimination was the real  reason\"; and finding that  Title VII\n\ndoes  not permit courts  \"to substitute for  the required finding\n\n                               -19-\n\nthat  the   employer's  action   was  the  product   of  unlawful\n\ndiscrimination, the much different (and much lesser) finding that\n\nthe employer's  explanation of  its action was  not believable\");\n\nRamos, 936  F.2d  at  48 (noting  that  refuting  the  employer's\n     \n\narticulated reasons  for taking  action against a  plaintiff does\n\nnot  suffice  to meet  the  plaintiff's  burden of  demonstrating\n\ndiscriminatory intent).   Thus, given Hoeppner's theory regarding\n\nCMRC's motives, Hoeppner's  evidence that she was a  good teacher\n\nand  that her TAs were troublemakers does not by itself establish\n\nthe necessary element of  causality between the sexual harassment\n\nreport and the discharge to support her Title VII action.\n\n          Hoeppner presents no other evidence that would  provide\n\nthis missing element.   As we already noted, Hoeppner  has failed\n\nto establish a pattern of fabrication by CMRC that would indicate\n\nthere was fabrication in this particular case.  Hoeppner provides\n\nno  affidavits from the complaining TAs stating that they did not\n\nmake  the alleged  complaints or  that  they were  pressured into\n\nlying by  CMRC administrators.   Instead, Hoeppner points  to the\n\nfact  that  neither  Cohen  nor Campbell  formally  observed  her\n\nclassroom to verify  the TAs'  complaints.  This  fact may  imply\n\nsomething about the accuracy  of the complaints against Hoeppner,\n\nbut it implies  nothing about the allegation that CMRC fabricated\n\nthe complaints.   CMRC  administrators could fabricate  their own\n\nobservations more  easily than  the complaints of  third parties,\n\nwho might later recant or  deny making the complaints.  In  fact,\n\ntheir own fabrications would  be more reliable as they  could not\n\n                               -20-\n\nbe subsequently contradicted by the source of the complaint.  \n\n          Hoeppner   alleges  that   TAs  Beetcher   and  LaBelle\n\ncomplained about her classroom supervision in retaliation for her\n\nreports of the TAs' own misconduct.  If true, this  would tend to\n\nrefute Hoeppner's  own claim that  CMRC administrators fabricated\n\nher  negative evaluations.   The  fact that Beetcher  and LaBelle\n\nlied  to  Campbell  and Cohen  implies  that  Campbell and  Cohen\n\nbelieved  Hoeppner had  problems  managing her  classroom or,  at\n\nleast,  that  Hoeppner's  TAs,  rather  than  CMRC  itself,  were\n\nresponsible for Hoeppner's  allegedly undeserved  probation.   In\n\nany  event,  several of  the other  TAs'  complaints, as  well as\n\nHoeppner's  first  performance  evaluation,  preceded  Hoeppner's\n\nreport  of Beetcher and LaBelle so CMRC could not have fabricated\n\nthese complaints against Hoeppner  in retaliation for  Hoeppner's\n\nreport of Beetcher and LaBelle.\n\n          Hoeppner also  attempts to  cast doubt on  the negative\n\nreports of Hoeppner's  classroom by Pam Flannery and  Pamela Shea\n\nthat were provided to  Cohen after Hoeppner's probationary period\n\nhad begun.  Hoeppner  points to an affidavit asserting  that CMRC\n\ncoerced   Flannery's  signed  statement   and  another  affidavit\n\nalleging that, contrary to Shea's own affidavit, Shea never spoke\n\nwith Cohen about  Hoeppner's classroom.   We do  not think  these\n\nmere  allegations are  sufficient  to  invalidate the  first-hand\n\nstatements  by Flannery and Shea.   Even if  they are sufficient,\n\nthe allegations do not raise a triable issue as to the claim that\n\nCMRC  fabricated  the  prior  complaints  against  Hoeppner   and\n\n                               -21-\n\nHoeppner's probation.\n\n          In  sum, even  if  a factual  issue  exists as  to  the\n\nvalidity of the complaints  against Hoeppner, summary judgment in\n\nfavor of CMRC would still be appropriate because Hoeppner has not\n\nestablished  that  her  discharge  was causally  related  to  the\n\nprotected activity of reporting sexual harassment.\n\n          The district court's judgment is therefore affirmed.\n                                                             \n\n                               -22-\n",

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-Appellee, Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center, Inc.  (\"CMRC\"), is a nonprofit school for the instruction and rehabilitation of multiply handicapped children and young adults.  Hoeppner was employed as a special education teacher at CMRC from September 1989 until November 9, 1990.  Hoeppner was in charge of a classroom at the school throughout her term of employment.  She was aided by several teacher assistants (\"TAs\"), who normally rotated through different classrooms over periods of three to six months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in December of 1989, several TAs complained to CMRC administrators about Hoeppner's management of her classroom and about Hoeppner's poor communication with, and supervision of, the TAs.  Hoeppner contests the validity and genuineness of some of these complaints, and questions the existence of others, but does not dispute that some complaints were made about her prior to her discharge and prior to her report of sexual harassment.  There is also no dispute that CMRC placed Hoeppner on probation for ninety days in August of 1990.  Subsequently, on November 1, 1990, Hoeppner reported several incidents of sexual harassment by one of her TAs.  On November 9, 1990, three days after the expiration of her probationary period, CMRC discharged Hoeppner on the ground that Hoeppner had allegedly failed to make suggested improvements in her classroom during the probationary period.  Hoeppner maintains that this ground is merely a pretext for the real reason underlying her termination:  Hoeppner's report of sexual harassment.  Before we address whether this allegation can survive summary judgment, we briefly recount the evidence concerning these events in more detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CMRC's Principal, Barbara Cohen, and its Assistant Principal, Archibald Campbell, state in affidavits that they received complaints about Hoeppner's supervision of her classroom on several occasions.  Cohen attests that in December of 1989, she met with Hoeppner's TAs to discuss problems between the TAs and Hoeppner.  Cohen claims that TAs Diana Velez and Jennifer Roy complained to her in January about the way Hoeppner was treating them in the classroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A meeting between Hoeppner, Cohen, and Hoeppner's TAs was held on January 20, 1990.  Cohen maintains that the meeting was specifically scheduled for the purpose of discussing the TAs' concerns about Hoeppner.  In her affidavit, Hoeppner claims that the meeting was a routine afterschool discussion of classroom matters at which Cohen solicited corrective suggestions from the TAs.  Even according to Hoeppner's account, however, the TAs \"talked basically at me\" and TA Velez stated at the meeting that Hoeppner was not providing Velez with sufficient feedback.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoeppner's first performance evaluation for the period of September 11, 1989, through December 11, 1989, was completed on February 12, 1990.  Cohen met with Hoeppner on February 24 to discuss the evaluation.  The evaluation rated Hoeppner's overall performance as fully satisfactory, although it noted several problems with her classroom management abilities.  Under a category entitled \"Developing and Motivating Subordinates,\" for example, the evaluation stated that Hoeppner's \"personal relationships with teacher assistants have been strained\" and that Hoeppner needed to be more open to input from the TAs.  Hoeppner signed the evaluation and remembers discussing it with Cohen.  She alleges, however, that the negative comments were untrue and fabricated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Assistant Principal Campbell claims that TAs Heidi Beetcher and James LaBelle complained sometime in July of 1990 about the way Hoeppner was treating them.  Campbell and Cohen subsequently scheduled a meeting for July 31, 1990, to discuss the problems.  Sometime prior to this meeting, Hoeppner alleges that she reported both Beetcher and LaBelle to CMRC for a variety of inappropriate conduct, including physical abuse of students, administering unauthorized medications, and tardiness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The July 31 meeting was attended by Cohen, Campbell, Hoeppner, and TAs Beetcher and LaBelle.  Cohen wrote an extensive memorandum documenting her version of the various complaints about Hoeppner that were raised at the meeting.  Cohen concluded in the memorandum that Hoeppner \"had repeated problems properly supervising and communicating with her staff....  As a result ... her performance as a teacher and as a classroom supervisor is inadequate.\"   Hoeppner does not dispute Cohen's account of the meeting, nor does she dispute that Beetcher and LaBelle complained about her supervision of the classroom.  Rather, Hoeppner alleges that Beetcher and LaBelle fabricated their complaints in retaliation for Hoeppner's prior act of reporting the two TAs to CMRC administrators for misconduct and abusing students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CMRC placed Hoeppner on probation on August 8, 1990.  Cohen met with Hoeppner the next day to discuss the reasons for the probation and the applicable terms and consequences of the ninety-day probationary period.  At the meeting, Cohen presented Hoeppner with the \"Disciplinary Action Form\" documenting the probation.  The form states that the probation resulted from Hoeppner's failure to properly supervise and communicate with her TAs.  The form also listed five changes involving Hoeppner's classroom management practices that \"must be made\" by Hoeppner to improve her behavior.  The form concluded with the statement:  \"If behavior does not improve, further disciplinary action may/will be taken:  Up to and including termination.\"   Hoeppner signed the form but did not write anything in the space for employee comments.  Hoeppner objects to the validity of the assertions contained in the form and alleges that CMRC placed her on probation as a threat to stop Hoeppner from reporting abuse of students and otherwise \"making waves\" at the school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cohen states in her affidavit that Hoeppner's performance did not improve during the probationary period.  She states that another TA, Pam Flannery, complained to her about Hoeppner's classroom management and supervision on October, 31, 1990.  Flannery signed a statement containing the details of her complaints, including allegations that Hoeppner's intimate relationship with another one of her TAs, Glenn Loucks, now espoused to Hoeppner, was causing trouble in the classroom.  Cohen states that Flannery indicated that the classroom was in chaos.  Hoeppner claims that the CMRC administration solicited Flannery's statement while it was pressuring Flannery to stay away from the union which Glenn Loucks and others were trying to organize at CMRC.  Hoeppner alleges that Flannery signed the statement to save her job and the statement is thus of dubious validity.  Mark Pierce, a Residential Counselor at CMRC, makes the same allegation as Hoeppner in his affidavit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, CMRC Education Staff Development Chair, Pamela Shea, states in an affidavit that she spoke with Hoeppner in early November (Cohen indicates that Shea informed her of this conversation on November 1) and determined that the situation in Hoeppner's classroom was chaotic and out of control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 1, 1990, Hoeppner first reported several incidents of sexual harassment to CMRC.  Hoeppner informed Assistant Principal Campbell that one of her TAs, Shane Waters, had made several sexually inappropriate overtures toward her, including touching her breasts from behind, placing his crotch three inches from her face, and rubbing her back.  Campbell and Cohen spoke with Waters on several occasions between November 2 and November 5, 1992.  Waters gave a somewhat different account of the incidents and denied that any of his actions had sexual connotations.  Campbell and Cohen told Waters that sexual harassment was not acceptable and that Waters should not do anything that could be interpreted by Hoeppner as sexual harassment.  Neither Cohen nor Campbell took any administrative action against Waters nor did they conduct any further investigation of the incident beyond their conversations with Waters.  Hoeppner claims that despite promising a full investigation, the CMRC administration did nothing and never informed her of what they would do, or had done, about the incidents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CMRC discharged Hoeppner on November 9, 1990, three days after her probationary period ended and eight days after she reported the incidents of sexual harassment.  According to the final performance evaluation written by Cohen upon Hoeppner's discharge, Hoeppner continued to have problems with her staff and did not improve her supervision and management of the classroom, as required by the terms of Hoeppner's probation.  In deposition testimony, Hoeppner stated that she did not change her behavior in response to the criticisms leveled by Cohen in the Disciplinary Action Form accompanying Hoeppner's probation because Hoeppner did not feel that the criticisms were valid.  Hoeppner does claim, however, that she did make changes in response to the particular needs of individual TAs and that, in general, she did improve her performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoeppner maintains that there were no significant problems in her classroom and asserts that the criticisms and complaints against her were untrue and fabricated.  She proffered affidavits of several current and former employees of CMRC who attest to Hoeppner's good teaching and supervisory abilities and who assert that Hoeppner did not have any problems with the staff in her classroom.  Hoeppner also points out that neither of her supervisors, Cohen and Campbell, formally observed Hoeppner's work in the classroom.  CMRC's motive for fabricating the complaints against her, Hoeppner claims, was to implicitly threaten her job so that Hoeppner would stop \"making waves\" at CMRC by reporting incidents of abuse of students, by reporting misconduct of other employees, and by supporting the efforts to organize a union at CMRC led by Glenn Loucks.  Several current and past employees assert in their affidavits that CMRC was trying to keep its employees quiet about incidents of student abuse so that the incidents could be hidden from the state regulators and from the public, thus avoiding the tarnishing of CMRC's reputation.  Several affiants make similar accusations regarding CMRC's efforts to discourage unionization at the school.  One affiant claims that CMRC's method of silencing employees was to falsify complaints against them and then threaten to fire them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected Hoeppner's claim and dismissed the case on summary judgment.  The court found no triable issue on the question of whether CMRC wrongfully discharged Hoeppner because CMRC \"reasonably and justifiably concluded that there was a problem in plaintiff's classroom.\"   The court also noted that the complaints against Hoeppner were made well before she reported the incidents of sexual harassment, so these complaints could not have been a fabricated pretext to cover up a retaliatory motive.  Consequently, the court found no evidence of a causal relationship between the protected activity of reporting sexual harassment and Hoeppner's discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish a claim of retaliatory discharge under Title VII, Hoeppner must show by a preponderance of the evidence that:  (1) she engaged in a protected activity as an employee, (2) she was subsequently discharged from employment, and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the discharge.  Ramos v. Roche Products, Inc., 936 F.2d 43, 48 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 379, 116 L.Ed.2d 330 (1991);  Juarez v. Ameritech Mobile Communications, Inc., 957 F.2d 317, 321 (7th Cir.1992).  Because reporting sexual harassment is a protected activity under Title VII, Morgan v. Massachusetts General Hospital, 901 F.2d 186, 194 (1st Cir.1990), and because Hoeppner was discharged after she reported the incidents of sexual harassment by Waters, there is no dispute that Hoeppner has established the first two elements of her retaliatory discharge claim.  The issue on appeal is whether, as the district court found, Hoeppner failed to present sufficient evidence of a causal link between her sexual harassment report and the subsequent discharge to defeat a motion for summary judgment.  To put it another way, the issue is whether the evidence in the record can show that CMRC's true reason or motive for firing Hoeppner was Hoeppner's report of sexual harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we are reviewing an order of summary judgment, we must determine whether the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and affidavits offered in this case, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, Hoeppner, present a genuine issue of material fact regarding the existence of a causal connection between Hoeppner's sexual harassment report and her subsequent discharge.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c);  Serrano-Perez v. FMC Corp., 985 F.2d 625, 626 (1st Cir.1993);  Oliver v. Digital Equipment Corp., 846 F.2d 103, 105 (1st Cir.1988).  Under the summary judgment standard, an issue is genuine \" 'if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.' \"  Oliver, 846 F.2d at 105 (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).  Although the party opposing the motion for summary judgment benefits from all reasonable inferences favorable to that party, the nonmovant \"may not rest upon mere allegations;  [he] must set forth specific facts demonstrating that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"  Id.  Even in discriminatory discharge cases, where the plaintiff can rarely present direct, subjective evidence of an employer's actual motive, the plaintiff cannot survive summary judgment with \"unsupported allegations and speculations,\" but rather must \"point to specific facts detailed in affidavits and depositions--that is, names, dates, incidents, and supporting testimony--giving rise to an inference of discriminatory animus.\"  Lipsett v. University of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881, 895 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoeppner claims on appeal that she presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether CMRC fabricated the alleged complaints against Hoeppner so that they could be used as a pretext for Hoeppner's later discharge, which was ultimately caused by the sexual harassment report.  Hoeppner acknowledges that the complaints against her and her subsequent probation preceded her report of sexual harassment to CMRC.  She argues, however, that CMRC fabricated the complaints and placed her on probation in order to discourage her from reporting staff abuse of students, supporting Loucks' union efforts, and otherwise \"making waves\" at CMRC.  Instead of remaining silent, Hoeppner ignored the implicit threats by CMRC and reported her TA for sexual harassment.  As a result, Hoeppner concludes, her sexual harassment complaint, though maybe not the sole reason for her discharge, was a \"significant and final reason\" for her discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Hoeppner's theory of the causal connection required under Title VII, Hoeppner would not have been fired but for her sexual harassment report because she defied CMRC's implicit threats to remain quiet only at the point when she reported the incidents involving Waters.  Had she not reported the incidents of sexual harassment, Hoeppner maintains, she would not have been discharged because CMRC administrators would have concluded that Hoeppner had ceased to \"make waves\" in response to their threats against her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the record convinces us that Hoeppner has failed to present sufficient evidence to support her theory of the causal connection between her report and her subsequent discharge.  Consequently, no genuine issue of material fact remains for trial.  Hoeppner's \"evidence\" consists mainly of unsupported allegations without any \"specific facts\" such as \"names, dates, incidents, and supporting testimony.\"  Lipsett, 864 F.2d at 895.   Specific facts are absent to support several crucial links along Hoeppner's alleged chain of causality:  (1) that CMRC had a practice of implicitly threatening teachers with fabricated negative teacher evaluations in order to cover up abuse of students at the school;  (2) that CMRC's practice of silencing teachers to cover up student abuse extended to the general practice of threatening teachers who were \"making waves\" by taking actions such as reporting incidents of sexual harassment;  and (3) that CMRC's alleged practice of threatening teachers through fabricated complaints was instituted against Hoeppner herself, resulting in Hoeppner's discharge after she made the sexual harassment report.  Because all these links are crucial to the third element in Hoeppner's Title VII cause of action, her failure to establish any one of them dooms her objection to CMRC's motion for summary judgment.  See, e.g., Ramos, 936 F.2d at 49 (noting that plaintiff's \"accusations remain largely conclusory and lacking in the concrete documentation necessary to prove the causal link between her protected activity and her retaliatory treatment\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Regarding the first causal link, Hoeppner presented evidence showing that CMRC had problems with the mistreatment and abuse of students by staff members.  There is also some evidence, although perhaps little more than a scintilla, that CMRC was trying to hide the incidents of abuse and mistreatment from the public, either to maintain its reputation or to avoid state regulators.  Hoeppner's further claim that CMRC fabricated complaints against teachers who reported abuse of students in an effort to silence them, however, is supported by nothing more than unsubstantiated allegations.  Hoeppner and Holly Brown, a staff psychologist at CMRC, both make assertions regarding CMRC's alleged silencing practice without noting any specific names, dates or incidents.  Glenn Loucks claims in his affidavit that sometime in November of 1990, \"after attempting to talk to a social worker from the state of Mass. for student P.C., Barbara Cohen told me that I would be fired for reporting child abuse to a state agency.  That I had to follow [CMRC] policy and that meant not breaking client confidentiality to any state agency.  [sic]\"  Loucks' statement might amount to some evidence of CMRC's practice of silencing employees except for the fact that Loucks states in the next paragraph of his affidavit that he did in fact report a case of child abuse to the New Hampshire Department of Children and Youth Service and yet he makes no claim that CMRC took any actions against him as a result.  More importantly, Loucks' allegation does not support the claim that CMRC administrators fabricated complaints against teachers to keep them quiet.  He makes no mention of fabrication or threats to fabricate complaints in his affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Robert Grassi, CMRC's Clinical Director, states in deposition testimony that CMRC's past Director of Psychology, Marilyn Russell, was discharged because she reported incidents of child abuse directly to state authorities in violation of CMRC policy.  Although this is the type of \"incident\" that might normally raise a triable issue of fact as to an established practice of CMRC, the practice is not one which involves fabricating teacher complaints to implicitly threaten teachers to keep quiet.  No allegations are made that CMRC fabricated complaints against Russell.  The problem with the \"evidence\" from Grassi's testimony is that it provides no details of the alleged retaliatory discharge of Russell--nor does Hoeppner offer any evidence from the people involved in the incident, including Russell herself--that would enable a reasonable jury to determine if it is the type of occurrence that is consistent with the alleged practice by CMRC to fabricate false complaints against teachers to prevent them from reporting abuse of students.  Grassi himself does not explain how he discovered the reasons for Russell's discharge and, indeed, states that he does not remember talking about these reasons when he spoke with Russell at the time of the alleged incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Even if Hoeppner had provided sufficient evidence to show that CMRC had a practice of fabricating complaints against teachers to discourage them from reporting student abuse, Hoeppner has still failed to establish a second crucial link in the chain connecting her discharge to the sexual harassment report:  that CMRC's concern with staff reports of student abuse to outside parties extended to a concern with the types of staff actions that Hoeppner engaged in, such as filing a sexual harassment report and reporting two of her TAs for misconduct.  In other words, Hoeppner has not established that she did anything that would cause CMRC to fabricate complaints against her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from the incidents reported by Hoeppner in this case, there is nothing in the record regarding any previous or subsequent complaints of sexual harassment filed by a CMRC employee, or regarding CMRC's retaliation, or threat to retaliate, against other employees who might have complained about sexual harassment.  Thus, Hoeppner has presented no evidence that an internal sexual harassment report would qualify as the type of conduct CMRC administrators would consider \"making waves\" or the type of action that would induce CMRC to retaliate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The closest thing to \"evidence\" concerning this issue is an affidavit by August Tardiff, a teacher at CMRC, who claims that in March of 1993, he reported to CMRC administrators that he felt physically threatened by one of his TAs.  Although the TA was temporarily removed from Tardiff's room, Tardiff claims that the administrators \"refused to take my fears seriously [and] told me I did not have a choice that I had to work with this man or leave.  They also gave me a disciplinary action in which they blamed me for the problem.  So I gave my resignation on April 12 to be effective on June 30th.\"   This single incident, occurring nearly three years after Hoeppner was discharged, would not by itself allow a reasonable jury to conclude that CMRC had a practice of fabricating complaints against teachers who reported sexual harassment at the time Hoeppner was fired.  To defeat a motion for summary judgment, \"[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position will be insufficient;  there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\"  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986);  see also Serrano-Perez, 985 F.2d at 627;  Milton v. Van Dorn Co., 961 F.2d 965, 969 (1st Cir.1992).  Tardiff's incident is too remote and too isolated to create a triable issue as to the fabrication of the complaints against Hoeppner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoeppner has further failed to provide evidence that administrators would consider any of her other actions while at CMRC as \"making waves,\" such that the administrators would have taken retaliatory action by fabricating complaints and placing Hoeppner on probation.  Hoeppner claims that she reported TAs Beetcher and LaBelle for misconduct in July of 1990.  Because this occurred after several TAs had already complained about Hoeppner, after CMRC wrote Hoeppner's first performance evaluation which mentioned some of the problems in Hoeppner's classroom, and possibly even after Beetcher and LaBelle first complained about Hoeppner to Campbell, Hoeppner's actions could not have led to CMRC's fabrication of the initial complaints against Hoeppner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoeppner also makes the unsupported assertion that CMRC retaliated against her because of her relationship with Loucks, who was attempting to organize a union at CMRC.  Several of Hoeppner's supporting affidavits discuss incidents in which CMRC administrators took actions to discourage unionization or union activities.  However, the record contains no evidence that Hoeppner ever took part in union activities and nothing indicates that CMRC thought she was involved with the union efforts.  Cohen did know that Hoeppner had an intimate relationship with Glenn Loucks, but nothing in the record indicates that Cohen or any other CMRC administrator imputed Loucks' union activity to Hoeppner.  The record is also devoid of any indication that employees' union activities were occurring before August of 1990, let alone that CMRC knew about any union activities before August of 1990, when Hoeppner was put on probation.  There is similarly no evidence that Cohen or anyone else at CMRC knew about the relationship between Loucks and Cohen until the \"fall of 1990,\" well after Hoeppner's probation.  Thus, there is insufficient competent evidence to raise a genuine issue as to whether anti-union animus motivated CMRC to fabricate complaints against Hoeppner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, there is insufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that CMRC had a practice of silencing employees by fabricating false negative evaluations against them, that CMRC had a practice of retaliating against teachers who, like Hoeppner, made reports of TA misconduct and sexual harassment, or that Hoeppner herself engaged in any activities that would cause CMRC to fabricate the complaints against her and her subsequent probation.  Thus, two important causal links necessary for her Title VII action are missing from the evidence in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Finally, Hoeppner has failed to establish a third crucial link in the causal chain between Hoeppner's report of sexual harassment and her discharge:  that CMRC's alleged silencing practice was applied to Hoeppner in this specific case through the fabrication of the complaints against her and through the subsequent discharge of Hoeppner when she continued to make waves by reporting incidents of sexual harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoeppner's evidence on this issue consists primarily of affidavits stating that Hoeppner was a good teacher, that she did not have problems in her classroom supervising, or communicating with, her TAs, and that the TAs themselves were really the troublemakers in Hoeppner's classroom.  Hoeppner wants this evidence to show that the complaints against her were not only untruthful and inaccurate but also fabricated.  As we have held on previous occasions, \"evidence contesting the factual underpinnings of the reasons for the [employment decision] proffered by the employer is insufficient, without more, to present a jury question.\"  Morgan, 901 F.2d at 191 (citing Dea v. Look, 810 F.2d 12, 15 (1st Cir.1987));  see also Ramos, 936 F.2d at 48.   Hoeppner cannot establish that CMRC's reasons for discharging her were merely a pretext for impermissible retaliation \"solely by contesting the objective veracity of [the employer's] action.\"  Morgan, 901 F.2d at 191.   Rather, Hoeppner must provide some additional evidence to indicate that the complaints were purposefully fabricated with the intent of threatening Hoeppner not to make waves.  See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2751-52, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) (finding that \"a reason cannot be proved to be 'a pretext for discrimination' unless it is shown both that the reason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason\";  and finding that Title VII does not permit courts \"to substitute for the required finding that the employer's action was the product of unlawful discrimination, the much different (and much lesser) finding that the employer's explanation of its action was not believable\");  Ramos, 936 F.2d at 48 (noting that refuting the employer's articulated reasons for taking action against a plaintiff does not suffice to meet the plaintiff's burden of demonstrating discriminatory intent).  Thus, given Hoeppner's theory regarding CMRC's motives, Hoeppner's evidence that she was a good teacher and that her TAs were troublemakers does not by itself establish the necessary element of causality between the sexual harassment report and the discharge to support her Title VII action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoeppner presents no other evidence that would provide this missing element.  As we already noted, Hoeppner has failed to establish a pattern of fabrication by CMRC that would indicate there was fabrication in this particular case.  Hoeppner provides no affidavits from the complaining TAs stating that they did not make the alleged complaints or that they were pressured into lying by CMRC administrators.  Instead, Hoeppner points to the fact that neither Cohen nor Campbell formally observed her classroom to verify the TAs' complaints.  This fact may imply something about the accuracy of the complaints against Hoeppner, but it implies nothing about the allegation that CMRC fabricated the complaints.  CMRC administrators could fabricate their own observations more easily than the complaints of third parties, who might later recant or deny making the complaints.  In fact, their own fabrications would be more reliable as they could not be subsequently contradicted by the source of the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoeppner alleges that TAs Beetcher and LaBelle complained about her classroom supervision in retaliation for her reports of the TAs' own misconduct.  If true, this would tend to refute Hoeppner's own claim that CMRC administrators fabricated their negative evaluations.  The fact that Beetcher and LaBelle lied to Campbell and Cohen implies that Campbell and Cohen believed Hoeppner had problems managing her classroom or, at least, that Hoeppner's TAs, rather than CMRC itself, were responsible for Hoeppner's allegedly undeserved probation.  In any event, several of the other TAs' complaints, as well as Hoeppner's first performance evaluation, preceded Hoeppner's report of Beetcher and LaBelle so CMRC could not have fabricated these complaints against Hoeppner in retaliation for Hoeppner's report of Beetcher and LaBelle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoeppner also attempts to cast doubt on the negative reports of Hoeppner's classroom by Pam Flannery and Pamela Shea that were provided to Cohen after Hoeppner's probationary period had begun.  Hoeppner points to an affidavit asserting that CMRC coerced Flannery's signed statement and another affidavit alleging that, contrary to Shea's own affidavit, Shea never spoke with Cohen about Hoeppner's classroom.  We do not think these mere allegations are sufficient to invalidate the first-hand statements by Flannery and Shea.  Even if they are sufficient, the allegations do not raise a triable issue as to the claim that CMRC fabricated the prior complaints against Hoeppner and Hoeppner's probation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, even if a factual issue exists as to the validity of the complaints against Hoeppner, summary judgment in favor of CMRC would still be appropriate because Hoeppner has not established that her discharge was causally related to the protected activity of reporting sexual harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> According to Hoeppner, Flannery's statement is allegedly contradicted by a subsequent October 9, 1992 letter by Flannery denying that the alleged incidents of sexual harassment had occurred in Hoeppner's classroom.  In the October 9 letter, Flannery does state that \"we all worked very well together\" in the classroom, however, she also states in the same letter that the relationship between Loucks and Hoeppner \"was causing friction and tension in [Hoeppner's] staff.\"   We see no contradiction between Flannery's signed statement and her subsequent letter</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Sec. 2000e-2.  Plaintiff-Appellant, Donna Hoeppner, alleges that she was fired because she reported several incidents of sexual harassment to her employer.  The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Hoeppner's employer and we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-Appellee, Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center, Inc.  (\"CMRC\"), is a nonprofit school for the instruction and rehabilitation of multiply handicapped children and young adults.  Hoeppner was employed as a special education teacher at CMRC from September 1989 until November 9, 1990.  Hoeppner was in charge of a classroom at the school throughout her term of employment.  She was aided by several teacher assistants (\"TAs\"), who normally rotated through different classrooms over periods of three to six months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in December of 1989, several TAs complained to CMRC administrators about Hoeppner's management of her classroom and about Hoeppner's poor communication with, and supervision of, the TAs.  Hoeppner contests the validity and genuineness of some of these complaints, and questions the existence of others, but does not dispute that some complaints were made about her prior to her discharge and prior to her report of sexual harassment.  There is also no dispute that CMRC placed Hoeppner on probation for ninety days in August of 1990.  Subsequently, on November 1, 1990, Hoeppner reported several incidents of sexual harassment by one of her TAs.  On November 9, 1990, three days after the expiration of her probationary period, CMRC discharged Hoeppner on the ground that Hoeppner had allegedly failed to make suggested improvements in her classroom during the probationary period.  Hoeppner maintains that this ground is merely a pretext for the real reason underlying her termination:  Hoeppner's report of sexual harassment.  Before we address whether this allegation can survive summary judgment, we briefly recount the evidence concerning these events in more detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CMRC's Principal, Barbara Cohen, and its Assistant Principal, Archibald Campbell, state in affidavits that they received complaints about Hoeppner's supervision of her classroom on several occasions.  Cohen attests that in December of 1989, she met with Hoeppner's TAs to discuss problems between the TAs and Hoeppner.  Cohen claims that TAs Diana Velez and Jennifer Roy complained to her in January about the way Hoeppner was treating them in the classroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A meeting between Hoeppner, Cohen, and Hoeppner's TAs was held on January 20, 1990.  Cohen maintains that the meeting was specifically scheduled for the purpose of discussing the TAs' concerns about Hoeppner.  In her affidavit, Hoeppner claims that the meeting was a routine afterschool discussion of classroom matters at which Cohen solicited corrective suggestions from the TAs.  Even according to Hoeppner's account, however, the TAs \"talked basically at me\" and TA Velez stated at the meeting that Hoeppner was not providing Velez with sufficient feedback.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoeppner's first performance evaluation for the period of September 11, 1989, through December 11, 1989, was completed on February 12, 1990.  Cohen met with Hoeppner on February 24 to discuss the evaluation.  The evaluation rated Hoeppner's overall performance as fully satisfactory, although it noted several problems with her classroom management abilities.  Under a category entitled \"Developing and Motivating Subordinates,\" for example, the evaluation stated that Hoeppner's \"personal relationships with teacher assistants have been strained\" and that Hoeppner needed to be more open to input from the TAs.  Hoeppner signed the evaluation and remembers discussing it with Cohen.  She alleges, however, that the negative comments were untrue and fabricated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Assistant Principal Campbell claims that TAs Heidi Beetcher and James LaBelle complained sometime in July of 1990 about the way Hoeppner was treating them.  Campbell and Cohen subsequently scheduled a meeting for July 31, 1990, to discuss the problems.  Sometime prior to this meeting, Hoeppner alleges that she reported both Beetcher and LaBelle to CMRC for a variety of inappropriate conduct, including physical abuse of students, administering unauthorized medications, and tardiness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The July 31 meeting was attended by Cohen, Campbell, Hoeppner, and TAs Beetcher and LaBelle.  Cohen wrote an extensive memorandum documenting her version of the various complaints about Hoeppner that were raised at the meeting.  Cohen concluded in the memorandum that Hoeppner \"had repeated problems properly supervising and communicating with her staff....  As a result ... her performance as a teacher and as a classroom supervisor is inadequate.\"   Hoeppner does not dispute Cohen's account of the meeting, nor does she dispute that Beetcher and LaBelle complained about her supervision of the classroom.  Rather, Hoeppner alleges that Beetcher and LaBelle fabricated their complaints in retaliation for Hoeppner's prior act of reporting the two TAs to CMRC administrators for misconduct and abusing students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CMRC placed Hoeppner on probation on August 8, 1990.  Cohen met with Hoeppner the next day to discuss the reasons for the probation and the applicable terms and consequences of the ninety-day probationary period.  At the meeting, Cohen presented Hoeppner with the \"Disciplinary Action Form\" documenting the probation.  The form states that the probation resulted from Hoeppner's failure to properly supervise and communicate with her TAs.  The form also listed five changes involving Hoeppner's classroom management practices that \"must be made\" by Hoeppner to improve her behavior.  The form concluded with the statement:  \"If behavior does not improve, further disciplinary action may/will be taken:  Up to and including termination.\"   Hoeppner signed the form but did not write anything in the space for employee comments.  Hoeppner objects to the validity of the assertions contained in the form and alleges that CMRC placed her on probation as a threat to stop Hoeppner from reporting abuse of students and otherwise \"making waves\" at the school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cohen states in her affidavit that Hoeppner's performance did not improve during the probationary period.  She states that another TA, Pam Flannery, complained to her about Hoeppner's classroom management and supervision on October, 31, 1990.  Flannery signed a statement containing the details of her complaints, including allegations that Hoeppner's intimate relationship with another one of her TAs, Glenn Loucks, now espoused to Hoeppner, was causing trouble in the classroom.  Cohen states that Flannery indicated that the classroom was in chaos.  Hoeppner claims that the CMRC administration solicited Flannery's statement while it was pressuring Flannery to stay away from the union which Glenn Loucks and others were trying to organize at CMRC.  Hoeppner alleges that Flannery signed the statement to save her job and the statement is thus of dubious validity.  Mark Pierce, a Residential Counselor at CMRC, makes the same allegation as Hoeppner in his affidavit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, CMRC Education Staff Development Chair, Pamela Shea, states in an affidavit that she spoke with Hoeppner in early November (Cohen indicates that Shea informed her of this conversation on November 1) and determined that the situation in Hoeppner's classroom was chaotic and out of control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 1, 1990, Hoeppner first reported several incidents of sexual harassment to CMRC.  Hoeppner informed Assistant Principal Campbell that one of her TAs, Shane Waters, had made several sexually inappropriate overtures toward her, including touching her breasts from behind, placing his crotch three inches from her face, and rubbing her back.  Campbell and Cohen spoke with Waters on several occasions between November 2 and November 5, 1992.  Waters gave a somewhat different account of the incidents and denied that any of his actions had sexual connotations.  Campbell and Cohen told Waters that sexual harassment was not acceptable and that Waters should not do anything that could be interpreted by Hoeppner as sexual harassment.  Neither Cohen nor Campbell took any administrative action against Waters nor did they conduct any further investigation of the incident beyond their conversations with Waters.  Hoeppner claims that despite promising a full investigation, the CMRC administration did nothing and never informed her of what they would do, or had done, about the incidents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CMRC discharged Hoeppner on November 9, 1990, three days after her probationary period ended and eight days after she reported the incidents of sexual harassment.  According to the final performance evaluation written by Cohen upon Hoeppner's discharge, Hoeppner continued to have problems with her staff and did not improve her supervision and management of the classroom, as required by the terms of Hoeppner's probation.  In deposition testimony, Hoeppner stated that she did not change her behavior in response to the criticisms leveled by Cohen in the Disciplinary Action Form accompanying Hoeppner's probation because Hoeppner did not feel that the criticisms were valid.  Hoeppner does claim, however, that she did make changes in response to the particular needs of individual TAs and that, in general, she did improve her performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoeppner maintains that there were no significant problems in her classroom and asserts that the criticisms and complaints against her were untrue and fabricated.  She proffered affidavits of several current and former employees of CMRC who attest to Hoeppner's good teaching and supervisory abilities and who assert that Hoeppner did not have any problems with the staff in her classroom.  Hoeppner also points out that neither of her supervisors, Cohen and Campbell, formally observed Hoeppner's work in the classroom.  CMRC's motive for fabricating the complaints against her, Hoeppner claims, was to implicitly threaten her job so that Hoeppner would stop \"making waves\" at CMRC by reporting incidents of abuse of students, by reporting misconduct of other employees, and by supporting the efforts to organize a union at CMRC led by Glenn Loucks.  Several current and past employees assert in their affidavits that CMRC was trying to keep its employees quiet about incidents of student abuse so that the incidents could be hidden from the state regulators and from the public, thus avoiding the tarnishing of CMRC's reputation.  Several affiants make similar accusations regarding CMRC's efforts to discourage unionization at the school.  One affiant claims that CMRC's method of silencing employees was to falsify complaints against them and then threaten to fire them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected Hoeppner's claim and dismissed the case on summary judgment.  The court found no triable issue on the question of whether CMRC wrongfully discharged Hoeppner because CMRC \"reasonably and justifiably concluded that there was a problem in plaintiff's classroom.\"   The court also noted that the complaints against Hoeppner were made well before she reported the incidents of sexual harassment, so these complaints could not have been a fabricated pretext to cover up a retaliatory motive.  Consequently, the court found no evidence of a causal relationship between the protected activity of reporting sexual harassment and Hoeppner's discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish a claim of retaliatory discharge under Title VII, Hoeppner must show by a preponderance of the evidence that:  (1) she engaged in a protected activity as an employee, (2) she was subsequently discharged from employment, and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the discharge.

The issue on appeal is whether, as the district court found, Hoeppner failed to present sufficient evidence of a causal link between her sexual harassment report and the subsequent discharge to defeat a motion for summary judgment.  To put it another way, the issue is whether the evidence in the record can show that CMRC's true reason or motive for firing Hoeppner was Hoeppner's report of sexual harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we are reviewing an order of summary judgment, we must determine whether the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and affidavits offered in this case, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, Hoeppner, present a genuine issue of material fact regarding the existence of a causal connection between Hoeppner's sexual harassment report and her subsequent discharge.

University of Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516408\"><a href=\"/opinion/516408/annabelle-lipsett-v-university-of-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></a></span>, 895 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoeppner claims on appeal that she presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether CMRC fabricated the alleged complaints against Hoeppner so that they could be used as a pretext for Hoeppner's later discharge, which was ultimately caused by the sexual harassment report.  Hoeppner acknowledges that the complaints against her and her subsequent probation preceded her report of sexual harassment to CMRC.  She argues, however, that CMRC fabricated the complaints and placed her on probation in order to discourage her from reporting staff abuse of students, supporting Loucks' union efforts, and otherwise \"making waves\" at CMRC.  Instead of remaining silent, Hoeppner ignored the implicit threats by CMRC and reported her TA for sexual harassment.  As a result, Hoeppner concludes, her sexual harassment complaint, though maybe not the sole reason for her discharge, was a \"significant and final reason\" for her discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Hoeppner's theory of the causal connection required under Title VII, Hoeppner would not have been fired but for her sexual harassment report because she defied CMRC's implicit threats to remain quiet only at the point when she reported the incidents involving Waters.  Had she not reported the incidents of sexual harassment, Hoeppner maintains, she would not have been discharged because CMRC administrators would have concluded that Hoeppner had ceased to \"make waves\" in response to their threats against her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the record convinces us that Hoeppner has failed to present sufficient evidence to support her theory of the causal connection between her report and her subsequent discharge.  Consequently, no genuine issue of material fact remains for trial.  Hoeppner's \"evidence\" consists mainly of unsupported allegations without any \"specific facts\" such as \"names, dates, incidents, and supporting testimony.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516408\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Lipsett,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/516408/annabelle-lipsett-v-university-of-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">895</span></a></span>.   Specific facts are absent to support several crucial links along Hoeppner's alleged chain of causality:  (1) that CMRC had a practice of implicitly threatening teachers with fabricated negative teacher evaluations in order to cover up abuse of students at the school;  (2) that CMRC's practice of silencing teachers to cover up student abuse extended to the general practice of threatening teachers who were \"making waves\" by taking actions such as reporting incidents of sexual harassment;  and (3) that CMRC's alleged practice of threatening teachers through fabricated complaints was instituted against Hoeppner herself, resulting in Hoeppner's discharge after she made the sexual harassment report.  Because all these links are crucial to the third element in Hoeppner's Title VII cause of action, her failure to establish any one of them dooms her objection to CMRC's motion for summary judgment.  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563224\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ramos,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/563224/nixa-ramos-v-roche-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">49</span> </a></span>(noting that plaintiff's \"accusations remain largely conclusory and lacking in the concrete documentation necessary to prove the causal link between her protected activity and her retaliatory treatment\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Regarding the first causal link, Hoeppner presented evidence showing that CMRC had problems with the mistreatment and abuse of students by staff members.  There is also some evidence, although perhaps little more than a scintilla, that CMRC was trying to hide the incidents of abuse and mistreatment from the public, either to maintain its reputation or to avoid state regulators.  Hoeppner's further claim that CMRC fabricated complaints against teachers who reported abuse of students in an effort to silence them, however, is supported by nothing more than unsubstantiated allegations.  Hoeppner and Holly Brown, a staff psychologist at CMRC, both make assertions regarding CMRC's alleged silencing practice without noting any specific names, dates or incidents.  Glenn Loucks claims in his affidavit that sometime in November of 1990, \"after attempting to talk to a social worker from the state of Mass. for student P.C., Barbara Cohen told me that I would be fired for reporting child abuse to a state agency.  That I had to follow [CMRC] policy and that meant not breaking client confidentiality to any state agency.  [sic]\"  Loucks' statement might amount to some evidence of CMRC's practice of silencing employees except for the fact that Loucks states in the next paragraph of his affidavit that he did in fact report a case of child abuse to the New Hampshire Department of Children and Youth Service and yet he makes no claim that CMRC took any actions against him as a result.  More importantly, Loucks' allegation does not support the claim that CMRC administrators fabricated complaints against teachers to keep them quiet.  He makes no mention of fabrication or threats to fabricate complaints in his affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Robert Grassi, CMRC's Clinical Director, states in deposition testimony that CMRC's past Director of Psychology, Marilyn Russell, was discharged because she reported incidents of child abuse directly to state authorities in violation of CMRC policy.  Although this is the type of \"incident\" that might normally raise a triable issue of fact as to an established practice of CMRC, the practice is not one which involves fabricating teacher complaints to implicitly threaten teachers to keep quiet.  No allegations are made that CMRC fabricated complaints against Russell.  The problem with the \"evidence\" from Grassi's testimony is that it provides no details of the alleged retaliatory discharge of Russell--nor does Hoeppner offer any evidence from the people involved in the incident, including Russell herself--that would enable a reasonable jury to determine if it is the type of occurrence that is consistent with the alleged practice by CMRC to fabricate false complaints against teachers to prevent them from reporting abuse of students.  Grassi himself does not explain how he discovered the reasons for Russell's discharge and, indeed, states that he does not remember talking about these reasons when he spoke with Russell at the time of the alleged incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Even if Hoeppner had provided sufficient evidence to show that CMRC had a practice of fabricating complaints against teachers to discourage them from reporting student abuse, Hoeppner has still failed to establish a second crucial link in the chain connecting her discharge to the sexual harassment report:  that CMRC's concern with staff reports of student abuse to outside parties extended to a concern with the types of staff actions that Hoeppner engaged in, such as filing a sexual harassment report and reporting two of her TAs for misconduct.  In other words, Hoeppner has not established that she did anything that would cause CMRC to fabricate complaints against her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from the incidents reported by Hoeppner in this case, there is nothing in the record regarding any previous or subsequent complaints of sexual harassment filed by a CMRC employee, or regarding CMRC's retaliation, or threat to retaliate, against other employees who might have complained about sexual harassment.  Thus, Hoeppner has presented no evidence that an internal sexual harassment report would qualify as the type of conduct CMRC administrators would consider \"making waves\" or the type of action that would induce CMRC to retaliate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The closest thing to \"evidence\" concerning this issue is an affidavit by August Tardiff, a teacher at CMRC, who claims that in March of 1993, he reported to CMRC administrators that he felt physically threatened by one of his TAs.  Although the TA was temporarily removed from Tardiff's room, Tardiff claims that the administrators \"refused to take my fears seriously [and] told me I did not have a choice that I had to work with this man or leave.  They also gave me a disciplinary action in which they blamed me for the problem.  So I gave my resignation on April 12 to be effective on June 30th.\"   This single incident, occurring nearly three years after Hoeppner was discharged, would not by itself allow a reasonable jury to conclude that CMRC had a practice of fabricating complaints against teachers who reported sexual harassment at the time Hoeppner was fired.  To defeat a motion for summary judgment, \"[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position will be insufficient;  there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\"  Anderson v.

Tardiff's incident is too remote and too isolated to create a triable issue as to the fabrication of the complaints against Hoeppner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoeppner has further failed to provide evidence that administrators would consider any of her other actions while at CMRC as \"making waves,\" such that the administrators would have taken retaliatory action by fabricating complaints and placing Hoeppner on probation.  Hoeppner claims that she reported TAs Beetcher and LaBelle for misconduct in July of 1990.  Because this occurred after several TAs had already complained about Hoeppner, after CMRC wrote Hoeppner's first performance evaluation which mentioned some of the problems in Hoeppner's classroom, and possibly even after Beetcher and LaBelle first complained about Hoeppner to Campbell, Hoeppner's actions could not have led to CMRC's fabrication of the initial complaints against Hoeppner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoeppner also makes the unsupported assertion that CMRC retaliated against her because of her relationship with Loucks, who was attempting to organize a union at CMRC.  Several of Hoeppner's supporting affidavits discuss incidents in which CMRC administrators took actions to discourage unionization or union activities.  However, the record contains no evidence that Hoeppner ever took part in union activities and nothing indicates that CMRC thought she was involved with the union efforts.  Cohen did know that Hoeppner had an intimate relationship with Glenn Loucks, but nothing in the record indicates that Cohen or any other CMRC administrator imputed Loucks' union activity to Hoeppner.  The record is also devoid of any indication that employees' union activities were occurring before August of 1990, let alone that CMRC knew about any union activities before August of 1990, when Hoeppner was put on probation.  There is similarly no evidence that Cohen or anyone else at CMRC knew about the relationship between Loucks and Cohen until the \"fall of 1990,\" well after Hoeppner's probation.  Thus, there is insufficient competent evidence to raise a genuine issue as to whether anti-union animus motivated CMRC to fabricate complaints against Hoeppner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, there is insufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that CMRC had a practice of silencing employees by fabricating false negative evaluations against them, that CMRC had a practice of retaliating against teachers who, like Hoeppner, made reports of TA misconduct and sexual harassment, or that Hoeppner herself engaged in any activities that would cause CMRC to fabricate the complaints against her and her subsequent probation.  Thus, two important causal links necessary for her Title VII action are missing from the evidence in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Finally, Hoeppner has failed to establish a third crucial link in the causal chain between Hoeppner's report of sexual harassment and her discharge:  that CMRC's alleged silencing practice was applied to Hoeppner in this specific case through the fabrication of the complaints against her and through the subsequent discharge of Hoeppner when she continued to make waves by reporting incidents of sexual harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoeppner's evidence on this issue consists primarily of affidavits stating that Hoeppner was a good teacher, that she did not have problems in her classroom supervising, or communicating with, her TAs, and that the TAs themselves were really the troublemakers in Hoeppner's classroom.  Hoeppner wants this evidence to show that the complaints against her were not only untruthful and inaccurate but also fabricated.  As we have held on previous occasions, \"evidence contesting the factual underpinnings of the reasons for the [employment decision] proffered by the employer is insufficient, without more, to present a jury question.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540006\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Morgan,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/540006/john-e-morgan-v-massachusetts-general-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">191</span> </a></span>(citing Dea v.

Hoeppner cannot establish that CMRC's reasons for discharging her were merely a pretext for impermissible retaliation \"solely by contesting the objective veracity of [the employer's] action.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540006\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Morgan,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/540006/john-e-morgan-v-massachusetts-general-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span>.   Rather, Hoeppner must provide some additional evidence to indicate that the complaints were purposefully fabricated with the intent of threatening Hoeppner not to make waves.  See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span> </a></span>(1993) (finding that \"a reason cannot be proved to be 'a pretext for discrimination' unless it is shown both that the reason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason\";  and finding that Title VII does not permit courts \"to substitute for the required finding that the employer's action was the product of unlawful discrimination, the much different (and much lesser) finding that the employer's explanation of its action was not believable\");  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563224\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ramos,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/563224/nixa-ramos-v-roche-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">48</span> </a></span>(noting that refuting the employer's articulated reasons for taking action against a plaintiff does not suffice to meet the plaintiff's burden of demonstrating discriminatory intent).  Thus, given Hoeppner's theory regarding CMRC's motives, Hoeppner's evidence that she was a good teacher and that her TAs were troublemakers does not by itself establish the necessary element of causality between the sexual harassment report and the discharge to support her Title VII action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoeppner presents no other evidence that would provide this missing element.  As we already noted, Hoeppner has failed to establish a pattern of fabrication by CMRC that would indicate there was fabrication in this particular case.  Hoeppner provides no affidavits from the complaining TAs stating that they did not make the alleged complaints or that they were pressured into lying by CMRC administrators.  Instead, Hoeppner points to the fact that neither Cohen nor Campbell formally observed her classroom to verify the TAs' complaints.  This fact may imply something about the accuracy of the complaints against Hoeppner, but it implies nothing about the allegation that CMRC fabricated the complaints.  CMRC administrators could fabricate their own observations more easily than the complaints of third parties, who might later recant or deny making the complaints.  In fact, their own fabrications would be more reliable as they could not be subsequently contradicted by the source of the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoeppner alleges that TAs Beetcher and LaBelle complained about her classroom supervision in retaliation for her reports of the TAs' own misconduct.  If true, this would tend to refute Hoeppner's own claim that CMRC administrators fabricated their negative evaluations.  The fact that Beetcher and LaBelle lied to Campbell and Cohen implies that Campbell and Cohen believed Hoeppner had problems managing her classroom or, at least, that Hoeppner's TAs, rather than CMRC itself, were responsible for Hoeppner's allegedly undeserved probation.  In any event, several of the other TAs' complaints, as well as Hoeppner's first performance evaluation, preceded Hoeppner's report of Beetcher and LaBelle so CMRC could not have fabricated these complaints against Hoeppner in retaliation for Hoeppner's report of Beetcher and LaBelle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoeppner also attempts to cast doubt on the negative reports of Hoeppner's classroom by Pam Flannery and Pamela Shea that were provided to Cohen after Hoeppner's probationary period had begun.  Hoeppner points to an affidavit asserting that CMRC coerced Flannery's signed statement and another affidavit alleging that, contrary to Shea's own affidavit, Shea never spoke with Cohen about Hoeppner's classroom.  We do not think these mere allegations are sufficient to invalidate the first-hand statements by Flannery and Shea.  Even if they are sufficient, the allegations do not raise a triable issue as to the claim that CMRC fabricated the prior complaints against Hoeppner and Hoeppner's probation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, even if a factual issue exists as to the validity of the complaints against Hoeppner, summary judgment in favor of CMRC would still be appropriate because Hoeppner has not established that her discharge was causally related to the protected activity of reporting sexual harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> According to Hoeppner, Flannery's statement is allegedly contradicted by a subsequent October 9, 1992 letter by Flannery denying that the alleged incidents of sexual harassment had occurred in Hoeppner's classroom.  In the October 9 letter, Flannery does state that \"we all worked very well together\" in the classroom, however, she also states in the same letter that the relationship between Loucks and Hoeppner \"was causing friction and tension in [Hoeppner's] staff.\"   We see no contradiction between Flannery's signed statement and her subsequent letter</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
