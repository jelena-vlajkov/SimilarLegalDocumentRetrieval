William Walsh  was charged with\r                                       \r\n\nvarious offenses  growing  out of  a  bank fraud  scheme  and\r\n\nconvicted on a majority of the counts.  His present appeal is\r\n\nprimarily directed at procedural issues.  We affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n     Walsh  was  indicted in  1992,  together  with four  co-\r\n\ndefendants, and charged  with conspiracy, twenty-nine  counts\r\n\nof bank  fraud, and  twenty-nine counts of  false statements.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.      2, 371,  1344,  1014.   The substance  of  the\r\n\nindictment was that  Walsh carried  out a  scheme to  defraud\r\n\nDime  Savings Bank  of  New York  (\"Dime-NY\").   He  did  so,\r\n\naccording to the charge, by directing his employees to obtain\r\n\n29  specific  loans through  the  use of  deceptions  so that\r\n\ncustomers  could purchase  condominiums  from  Walsh and  his\r\n\nassociates.\r\n\n     Walsh's  trial  occurred  in  February  and March  1994.\r\n\nTaken in  the  light most  favorable to  the verdict,  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.  Tuesta-Toro, 29  F.3d 771,  773  (1st Cir.  1994),\r                                  \r\n\ncert. denied, 115 S.  Ct. 947 (1995), the  evidence permitted\r                        \r\n\nthe  jury  to find  the following.    Walsh was  a Cambridge,\r\n\nMassachusetts,  city  councillor,  lawyer,  and  real  estate\r\n\ndeveloper.  With a group of investors, he purchased apartment\r\n\nbuildings  or   complexes,   converted  the   property   into\r\n\ncondominiums, and  sold the condominiums  to customers, using\r\n\nthe unit sales to pay off the acquisition financing.  \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\n     Walsh ordinarily served as a trustee of the realty trust\r\n\nthat acquired  the building,  acted as legal  counsel to  the\r\n\ntrust, and  usually served  as the trust's  representative in\r\n\nthe sale  of the individual condominium units.   During 1986,\r\n\nsales of units  in one of the projects started to fall behind\r\n\nschedule and the trust began to have difficulty  repaying its\r\n\nacquisition  loan.   Walsh then  discovered that  Dime-NY had\r\n\nrecently created a wholly  owned subsidiary, called Dime Real\r\n\nEstate  Services  of   Massachusetts,  Inc.  (\"Dime-MA\"),  to\r\n\noriginate  mortgage loans  in  Massachusetts.   Dime-MA  made\r\n\nmortgage loans  available  rapidly--with no  verification  of\r\n\nincome,  assets or  down payments--but  the loans  required a\r\n\ntwenty  percent  down  payment and  secondary  financing  was\r\n\nprohibited.\r\n\n     On  this failing project, and then  on two others, Walsh\r\n\ndirected his employees to arrange loans from Dime-MA for unit\r\n\npurchasers and  to falsify documents submitted  to Dime-MA to\r\n\nconceal  the existence  of secondary  financing (and  in some\r\n\ncases  third  mortgages as  well).   In  the  three projects,\r\n\napproximately  half  the  customers  defaulted   and  Dime-MA\r\n\nincurred  substantial  losses.     An  investigation  ensued,\r\n\nfollowed by  the indictment already described.   Three of the\r\n\nfour co-defendants pleaded guilty; charges against the fourth\r\n\nco-defendant were abandoned.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n     Jury deliberations  began on March 22,  1994.  Following\r\n\nthe  dismissal of a juror during deliberations, the jury (now\r\n\nreduced to 11 members)  continued deliberations, and on March\r\n\n28, 1994, it returned  41 guilty and 18 not  guilty verdicts.\r\n\nWalsh  was thereafter sentenced and now appeals.  Most of the\r\n\nclaims  of error concern the  dismissal of the  juror and its\r\n\naftermath, so  we begin  with that  subject, starting with  a\r\n\ndescription of the pertinent events.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n     On March 23,  1994, a  note was received  from the  jury\r\n\nindicating that one  of the  jurors wished to  meet with  the\r\n\njudge,  adding:   \"He  has several  questions  and we  cannot\r\n\nrelate  to him  in  any  way, shape,  or  form.\"   The  judge\r\n\ndeclined to meet with an  individual juror, but the following\r\n\nday a court security officer reported that the foreperson was\r\n\nconcerned  that  one  of  the  jurors  had  become  \"mentally\r\n\nunstable.\"   After consulting  with counsel, the  trial judge\r\n\ninterviewed   the  foreperson,   and   learned  of   constant\r\n\ninterruptions by \"juror X\",  irrelevant statements by juror X\r\n\nabout events in his past life, and juror  X's efforts to show\r\n\nother  jurors  written  materials consisting  of  a  campaign\r\n\nbrochure and  a newspaper clipping from his  prior efforts to\r\n\nwin elective office.\r\n\n     After consulting  further with counsel,  the trial judge\r\n\ninterviewed juror  X; as  in the  judge's interview with  the\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nforeperson,  counsel and  Walsh  himself were  present.   The\r\n\njudge  cautioned juror  X not  to indicate  his views  on the\r\n\nmerits of the case.   The interview, which began  by focusing\r\n\non  the material that the  juror brought into  the jury room,\r\n\ninvolved disjointed and rambling comments  by juror X.  Juror\r\n\nX also  mentioned a self-described \"nervous  problem\" and his\r\n\ngeneral discharge from the military.  Some of the questioning\r\n\nwas  based  on  questions  that  had  been suggested  by  the\r\n\ngovernment and defense counsel.  \r\n\n     Finally, out of the presence of juror X, the court asked\r\n\nboth sides for their position as to whether juror X should be\r\n\nexcused, and  defense counsel  after consultation with  Walsh\r\n\nindicated that he \"would  not object if the Court  decided to\r\n\nkeep him or eliminate him.  . . . [Either way] we  would move\r\n\nfor a mistrial.\"   The  government said that  it thought  the\r\n\njuror  was disabled and should  be excused.   The trial judge\r\n\nthen  excused the juror, agreeing  that he was  \"not a person\r\n\ncapable of  engaging in  rational discussions based  upon the\r\n\nevidence.\"\r\n\n     Thereafter, the remaining jurors  were sent home for the\r\n\nrest  of the day.  The following morning Walsh filed a motion\r\n\nfor  mistrial,  arguing that  the  ability  of the  remaining\r\n\njurors to be impartial and open-minded had been undermined by\r\n\ntheir exposure  to juror  X.   No one at  this point  knew or\r\n\nclaimed to know how juror X had proposed to vote.   The court\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nagreed  to question  the remaining  jurors and  solicited and\r\n\nreceived proposed questions from counsel.  \r\n\n     Then the district judge, in  the presence of counsel and\r\n\nthe defendant, questioned each  of the 11 jurors individually\r\n\nas to whether juror X had  discussed the merits prior to  the\r\n\njury's  deliberations, had  brought  material  into the  jury\r\n\nroom,  and had  discussed his  own personal  experiences--and\r\n\nwhether the juror being questioned could, to  the extent that\r\n\nthese events had occurred, put them aside and decide the case\r\n\nimpartially based on  the evidence presented.   Eight of  the\r\n\njurors had been  exposed to  a campaign brochure  and an  old\r\n\nnewspaper article  about one of  juror X's campaigns;  all of\r\n\nthe   jurors  had   heard  juror   X  discuss   his  personal\r\n\nexperiences; and three jurors had heard comments from juror X\r\n\nabout   the  merits  of  the  case  prior  to  the  start  of\r\n\ndeliberations.  \r\n\n     Each  juror affirmed his or her ability to put aside the\r\n\ncampaign material,  the personal experiences of  juror X, and\r\n\nany comments made by him before deliberations began.  Defense\r\n\ncounsel  challenged three  jurors who  had heard  comments by\r\n\njuror  X before  deliberations  began, the  substance of  the\r\n\ncomments not being  revealed.   With respect to  each of  the\r\n\nthree jurors,  the trial judge  made findings that  the juror\r\n\nwas credible in saying  that the pre-deliberation comments of\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\njuror X would have no effect.  The trial judge  then denied a\r\n\nmistrial.\r\n\n     At the request of defense  counsel, the trial judge told\r\n\nthe  jury  that it  could  begin its  deliberations  from the\r\n\nbeginning if it wished; the court  also told the jury not  to\r\n\ndiscount  a position taken \"just because  [juror X] took it.\"\r\n\nThe  jurors  then  deliberated  for  the  rest  of  the  day.\r\n\nReturning after a weekend break, they continued deliberations\r\n\nand asked for reinstruction  on substantive issues.  Late  in\r\n\nthe same day, they  returned the 41 guilty and  18 not guilty\r\n\nverdicts.\r\n\n     1.   Walsh's  first claim  of  error is  that the  trial\r\n\ncourt erred in dismissing  juror X.  Walsh argues  that there\r\n\nwas no  psychological testing  or psychiatric  examination of\r\n\njuror X, and  the evidence did  not show that  he was  either\r\n\nmentally  incompetent or otherwise  incapable of  engaging in\r\n\nrational  decision-making.   In  substance, Walsh  says  that\r\n\njuror   X  was   simply  an  unpopular,   perhaps  irritating\r\n\nparticipant who  probably sided with the  defendant and whose\r\n\nremoval led to a prompt agreement to convict.  \r\n\n     Walsh did  not make a  timely objection on  this ground.\r\n\nAt the time  of the dismissal, his counsel did  not object to\r\n\nexcusing  juror  X,  or  argue for  psychiatric  testing,  or\r\n\nsuggest  that juror  X could  be dismissed  only if  a higher\r\n\ndegree  of irrationality  were  shown.   Instead, Walsh  made\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nclear  his intention  to move  for a  mistrial; and  when the\r\n\nmistrial motion was filed, the ground--inconsistent  with the\r\n\ncontention  now  made--was that  juror  X  was someone  whose\r\n\n\"psychiatric  problems\" had  been \"clearly  demonstrated\" and\r\n\nwhose \"negative influence\" on other jurors was apparent.\r\n\n     Although, for  these reasons, the objection  now made is\r\n\nreviewable only for plain error, the dismissal of juror X was\r\n\nnot error at all.   Federal Rule of Criminal  Procedure 23(b)\r\n\npermits the judge to  excuse a juror \"for just  cause\" during\r\n\ndeliberations and to allow the remaining 11 jurors to reach a\r\n\nverdict.    The trial  judge  has  substantial discretion  in\r\n\nexercising this responsibility and  may remove the juror when\r\n\n\"convinced that  the juror's abilities to  perform his duties\r\n\n[have] become impaired.\"  United States v. Huntress, 956 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n1309, 1312 (5th  Cir. 1992),  cert. denied, 113  S. Ct.  2330\r                                                      \r\n\n(1993).   Similarly, in  United States v.  Molinares Charris,\r                                                                        \r\n\n822 F.2d 1213, 1223 (1st Cir. 1987),  we permitted a judge to\r\n\nexcuse a juror who had taken a tranquilizer pill and appeared\r\n\nsomewhat unstable.\r\n\n     The trial judge carefully  and repeatedly consulted with\r\n\ncounsel  in determining  the course  of the  inquiry and  the\r\n\nquestions  to be  put  to  juror X.    See  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nChorney,  63 F.3d 78, 81 (1st  Cir. 1995).  The transcript of\r                   \r\n\njuror  X's voir dire, which  need not be  repeated in detail,\r                                \r\n\ngave  the trial  judge ample  basis for  concluding  that the\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\njuror was  not able to  perform his duties.   Whether  or not\r\n\njuror  X was  incompetent  as  a  juror  under  28  U.S.C.   \r\n\n1865(b)(4),  \"just cause\"  existed under  Rule 23(b)  for his\r\n\nremoval in this  case.  See  United States v. Reese,  33 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n166,  172-73 (2d  Cir. 1994),  cert. denied,  115 S.  Ct. 756\r                                                       \r\n\n(1995) (just cause not limited to incompetence).\r\n\n     There  is no  evidence that  the trial  judge  knew that\r\n\njuror X favored acquittal,  if indeed juror X  did.  Nor  did\r\n\ndefense counsel  make any such suggestion  when he acquiesced\r\n\nin the dismissal of  juror X.  If anything,  Walsh's mistrial\r\n\nmotion suggested  that  juror X  might  be hostile  to  Walsh\r\n\nbecause  Walsh was a lawyer  and politician.   Dismissal of a\r\n\nknown holdout  juror raises  an entirely  different question.\r\n\nCompare  United States  v. Hernandez,  862 F.2d  17 (2d  Cir.\r                                                \r\n\n1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1032 (1989).\r                               \r\n\n     2.   Walsh's second  objection is  that even if  juror X\r\n\nwas  properly removed, the  court erred in  permitting the 11\r\n\nremaining  jurors  to return  a  verdict.   Walsh's  broadest\r\n\ngrounds for this  objection are  legal:  he  claims that  the\r\n\nConstitution  does not permit a  jury with only  11 jurors to\r\n\ndecide  a  federal criminal  case  over  the objection  of  a\r\n\ndefendant.    He also  asserts  that  Rule 23(b)--which  does\r\n\npermit this course--could not be lawfully enacted through the\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nRules  Enabling  Act procedures.    18 U.S.C.      3771, 3772\r\n\n(1982).1\r\n\n     Neither of  these objections was  made at the  time that\r\n\nthe district  court was determining whether to  permit the 11\r\n\nremaining   jurors  to  deliberate   and,  accordingly,  both\r\n\nobjections are subject to review only for plain error.  It is\r\n\ntrue  that both issues were  raised in the  trial court after\r                                                                         \r\n\nthe verdict by a  post-verdict motion for dismissal or  a new\r\n\ntrial. But the usual rule  is that an objection must be  made\r\n\nknown  at the time that  the court is  making its decision to\r\n\nact, e.g.,  United States  v. Gonzalez-Torres, 980  F.2d 788,\r                                                         \r\n\n791 (1st  Cir. 1992), and  here the proper time  to raise the\r\n\nobjections  was  when  the  court  was  deciding  whether  to\r\n\ncontinue with 11 jurors.      In this case, in any event, the\r\n\nstandard  of review does not matter  as to the constitutional\r\n\nclaim because  in  Williams  v. Florida,  399  U.S.  78,  103\r                                                   \r\n\n(1970),  the Supreme Court  said that the  12-member jury was\r\n\nnot required  by the Constitution  and that Congress  and the\r\n\nstates  could  select  a different  number.    We think  that\r\n\nWilliams effectively answers the claim that 11 jurors are too\r                    \r\n\nfew.   A number of circuits  have held that a jury  of 11 can\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1The separate provisions  enabling the Supreme  Court to\r\nprescribe rules of criminal procedure were later repealed and\r\nconsolidated with the Rules Enabling Act provisions governing\r\nthe  enactment  of  rules   of  civil  procedure.

The Supreme\r\n\nCourt has  not said whether a  less-than-unanimous verdict is\r\n\nacceptable.   Compare Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404 (1972).\r                                                   \r\n\nBut  whether it  is  or not,  we  think that  rendition of  a\r\n\nverdict agreed to by all jurors, after one juror with unknown\r\n\nviews has been dismissed for cause, is a unanimous verdict.\r\n\n     The  gist of Walsh's claim under  the Rules Enabling Act\r\n\nis  that Congress might be able to alter the requisite number\r\n\nfrom  12 to  11 but  that Rule  23(b) was  adopted--under the\r\n\nprocedures specified by  the Rules Enabling  Act--by judicial\r\n\naction  coupled with  Congress' failure  to veto  the change.\r\n\nInaction, says Walsh, is not enough for a fundamental change.\r\n\nThe Second  Circuit has concluded, however,  that this change\r\n\ncan be accomplished through  the enabling procedures.  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

Walsh did make in  timely fashion an objection that\r\n\nthis  jury was  not  capable  after  juror X's  discharge  of\r\n\nrendering  a fair and impartial verdict.  When this issue was\r\n\nraised by Walsh immediately after the discharge, the district\r\n\ncourt  properly undertook \"an  adequate inquiry  to determine\r\n\n[what  had happened and] .  . . whether  it was prejudicial.\"\r\n\nUnited  States v.  Ortiz-Arrigoitia, 996  F.2d 436,  442 (1st\r                                               \r\n\nCir. 1993), cert. denied,  114 S. Ct. 1368  (1994).

But we do not see why\r\nrejection  of an untimely legal claim  should be reviewed for\r\nanything  more than  plain error.   See  Gonzalez-Torres, 980\r                                                                    \r\nF.2d at 791.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\nv.  Boylan, 898 F.2d 230,  258 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 498\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 849 (1990).  \r\n\n     As already  noted, the district  court judge  separately\r\n\nexamined each of the jurors, asking his own questions as well\r\n\nas various questions suggested by counsel.  In each instance,\r\n\nthe judge  received a  forthright declaration that  the juror\r\n\nwas not going to be affected by the personal comments made by\r\n\njuror X, by materials he had brought into the jury room, or--\r\n\nin the case  of three  jurors--by the comments  that juror  X\r\n\nmade  about  the  merits  before deliberations  began.    The\r\n\njudgment of the trial judge, who can appraise the jurors face\r\n\nto face, deserves great weight.\r\n\n     Although  Walsh now  complains that  the district  judge\r\n\nlimited  his own  questioning unduly--in  an effort  to avoid\r\n\nlearning how the jurors were leaning--Walsh did not press for\r\n\nmore detailed inquiry  at the time.  The trial judge treads a\r\n\ndelicate  line in this  kind of  inquiry.   Assuming arguendo\r                                                                         \r\n\nthat Walsh is right in saying that Fed. R. Evid. 606(b)  does\r\n\nnot  apply prior to the verdict, there are still obvious good\r\n\nreasons for a trial judge to avoid learning how an individual\r\n\njuror  is leaning.  United  States v. Rengifo,  789 F.2d 975,\r                                                         \r\n\n985 (1st Cir. 1986).\r\n\n     Although Walsh  now argues  that there is  a substantial\r\n\nchance that the jurors were prejudiced by juror X, nothing in\r\n\nthe record  makes this  at all  likely.   In addition  to the\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\njurors' own denials,  we note that  the brochure had  nothing\r\n\ndirectly to  do with the trial; there is no reason to believe\r\n\nthat  a newspaper article brought in by a juror regarding his\r\n\nprior  political  campaign contained  anything  material; and\r\n\njudging by the voir dire of juror X, his personal experiences\r                                    \r\n\nwere also not germane to the trial.\r\n\n     Walsh now argues that juror X was hostile to lawyers and\r\n\npoliticians (Walsh was both) and that this view may have been\r\n\npassed on to the other  jurors.  In fact, juror X's  brochure\r\n\nwas  more  qualified, expressing  (in  a  description of  X's\r\n\n\"positions\")  objections  to  \"the   [unspecified]  unethical\r\n\nethics practiced by certain members  of the bar\" and \"machine\r\n\ncontrolled politics  and .  . . [unspecified]  dirty tricks.\"\r\n\nThe  jurors  said that  they  paid  little attention  to  the\r\n\npamphlet.   Further, it is  Walsh who now  takes the position\r\n\nthat juror X  favored Walsh, which hardly suggests that juror\r                                 \r\n\nX was denigrating Walsh.\r\n\n     Finally, Walsh now complains that by discharging juror X\r\n\nthe  court led the jury to think  that juror X's views should\r\n\nbe disregarded.   In fact, the judge expressly  cautioned the\r\n\njury not to  discount views simply because  they were earlier\r\n\nexpressed by juror  X.  Walsh also says that  the jury should\r\n\nhave  been directed  to start  its deliberations  anew.   The\r\n\njudge told the  jury that it was entitled to  start anew.  We\r\n\nthink  that this was all that was either useful or necessary.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\nAt the time,  Walsh raised no  objection to the  instructions\r\n\ngiven.    4.   Walsh's last claim of error based on the juror\r\n\nX episode relates  to a  post-trial event.   According to  an\r\n\naffidavit from Walsh's secretary, she received a call a  week\r\n\nor so after  the verdict from someone  identifying himself as\r\n\njuror X who  said he had been  on the defendant's side,  that\r\n\nthe  defendant  had  been  \"railroaded,\" and  that  she  (the\r\n\nsecretary) \"would not believe what went on in the jury room.\"\r\n\nAbout  a  month  later,  Walsh submitted  this  affidavit  in\r\n\nsupport of a request that the jury and juror X  be subject to\r\n\nfurther voir dire or authorized inquiry by counsel.  \r                             \r\n\n     The district court declined  to hold such a post-verdict\r\n\ninquiry  or to  authorize discussions with  the jurors  or to\r\n\ngrant a new  trial based on the affidavit.   Walsh now argues\r\n\nthat  because  the  parties  were  barred  from  unsupervised\r\n\ncontact  with the jurors after  the verdict, United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nKepreos, 759 F.2d 961, 967 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n901 (1985), the trial  court had an obligation to  conduct an\r\n\ninvestigation  itself.   The  abuse  of  discretion  standard\r\n\ngoverns this claim, see Boylan, 898 F.2d at 258, and we think\r                                          \r\n\nthat there was no such abuse in this case. \r\n\n     The  restrictions  on   post-verdict  contact  and   the\r\n\nlimitations  on juror testimony  about deliberations, Fed. R.\r\n\nEvid.  606(b), exist  to protect  important interests  in the\r\n\nfinality of the verdict and the privacy of the deliberations.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\nSee  Tanner v. United States, 483  U.S. 107, 120 (1987).  The\r                                        \r\n\naffidavit  contains only general rhetoric from juror X and no\r\n\nspecific allegations of misconduct.   Given what the district\r\n\ncourt  already  knew  about  juror X,  the  telephone  call--\r\n\nassuming  (as we  do)  that it  came  from juror  X--did  not\r\n\nrequire any further inquiry.\r\n\n                             III.\r\n\n     Walsh's brief raises two further  issues, both unrelated\r\n\nto  juror X.   The  first claim  relates to  the government's\r\n\nadmitted failure to turn  over certain documents in  a timely\r\n\nfashion.  The documents related to Frances Schwartz, a senior\r\n\nattorney  working for  Walsh who  was assigned  to the  three\r\n\ndevelopment  projects involved  in this  case.   Schwartz was\r\n\nindicted with Walsh and was one of the co-defendants who pled\r\n\nguilty to the conspiracy count and testified against Walsh at\r\n\ntrial.  \r\n\n     On direct examination, Schwartz gave  damaging testimony\r\n\nagainst  Walsh.    In addition  to  identifying  a  number of\r\n\ndocuments and  describing the  operations of Walsh's  office,\r\n\nSchwartz testified  to  discussions and  correspondence  with\r\n\nWalsh  that--as  recounted   and  interpreted  by  Schwartz--\r\n\nconfirmed Walsh's knowing  participation in and direction  of\r\n\nthe  fraud.   Schwartz'  testimony was  thus quite  damaging,\r\n\nalthough another co-defendant who pled guilty also  testified\r\n\nthat  Walsh  knowingly   directed  the  concealment   of  the\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n\nsecondary financing.     Early   in   her  cross-examination,\r\n\nSchwartz mentioned that she had \"daytimers\" or calendars that\r\n\nshe  had used  to refresh  her recollection.   Later,  on re-\r\n\ncross, she  mentioned that she had allowed  the government to\r\n\nreview  the daytimers and make  copies of them.   The defense\r\n\nimmediately  objected   that  it   had  never   received  the\r\n\ndaytimers.   The government said that  these daytimers should\r\n\nhave  been disclosed  earlier  but had  been overlooked  when\r\n\nother  materials from  Schwartz  had been  made available  to\r\n\nWalsh's counsel.   Copies of the  daytimers were provided  to\r\n\nthe defendant later that day.\r\n\n     Following a timely  motion by Walsh to  dismiss the case\r\n\nbecause  of this  delay, the trial  court denied  the motion,\r\n\nfinding   that  Walsh's   strategy   would   not  have   been\r\n\nsubstantially different if  the daytimers had been  disclosed\r\n\nearlier.   The court instructed  the jury that the government\r\n\nhad failed in its discovery obligation, and  it allowed Walsh\r\n\nto  recall Schwartz  to continue  her examination,  using the\r\n\ndaytimers  to  try   to  establish  inconsistencies   between\r\n\nSchwartz'  prior  testimony and  the  daytimers.   Walsh  now\r\n\ncomplains that this was inadequate.\r\n\n     This court previously  considered the  issue of  delayed\r\n\ndisclosure  of impeachment material  required to be disclosed\r\n\nunder  the Jencks Act.   United States v.  Arboleda, 929 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n858,  862-65  (1st Cir.  1991).

Osorio,  929 F.2d  753, 758  (1st Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1991).  \r\n\n     On this appeal, Walsh  argues that if his  trial counsel\r\n\nhad  received the daytimers earlier, he would have focused at\r\n\nthe outset on the  alleged inconsistencies between  Schwartz'\r\n\ntestimony  and the  daytimers instead  of attempting  to cast\r\n\ndoubt on the reliability of her memory.  In fact, the initial\r\n\ncross-examination  did  not  focus  on Schwartz'  memory  but\r\n\nrather  on her veracity, which  the defense counsel sought to\r\n\nundermine  by emphasizing her  prior drug use  and her desire\r\n\nfor a lenient  sentence.   And when Schwartz  was subject  to\r\n\nfurther cross after the  daytimers had been produced, Walsh's\r\n\ncounsel    paid   minimal    attention   to    the   supposed\r\n\ninconsistencies.  \r\n\n     Walsh says  that when Schwartz was  recalled for further\r\n\ncross  after the daytimers had been produced, it was too late\r\n\nto cross-examine  effectively on inconsistencies  because she\r\n\nhad been \"well prepared by the government to explain away any\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\ninconsistencies.\"  As it happens, there is no evidence of any\r\n\nsuch discussion  after the  daytimers first became  an issue.\r\n\nAs to  preparation prior to the  original direct examination,\r\n\nthe government  was entitled to prepare the  witness, and the\r\n\nrisk  of  facing an  initially  prepared  witness would  have\r\n\nexisted whether or not the daytimers had been produced.  \r\n\n     Walsh's  final claim  of error,  a claim  raised  in the\r\n\ndistrict  court  and rejected  there,  is  that the  evidence\r\n\nfailed  to  show  that the  victim  was  a  federally insured\r\n\nfinancial  institution.    At  the  time  of  the  fraudulent\r\n\nfilings,  18 U.S.C.    1344  aimed at  schemes to  defraud \"a\r\n\nfederally chartered or insured  financial institution\" or  to\r\n\nobtain  property owned by, or under the custody or control of\r\n\nsuch an institution through falsehoods.  See United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nBrandon,  17 F.3d 409, 424 n.11 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 115\r                                                                    \r\n\nS. Ct. 81  (1994).  Walsh's argument  turns on the  fact that\r\n\nDime-NY  was  a  federally  insured  bank,  but  Dime-MA--the\r\n\nimmediate maker of the loans--was not.  The government quotes\r\n\nto  us in response a statement from  Brandon, 17 F.3d at 426,\r                                                        \r\n\nthat\r\n\n     the government  does not  have to show  the alleged\r\n     scheme  was  directed  solely  toward  a particular\r                                              \r\n     institution;   it  is   sufficient  to   show  that\r\n     defendant  knowingly  executed a  fraudulent scheme\r\n     that exposed a federally insured  bank to a risk of\r\n     loss.\r\n\nThat  language,   however,  was  directed  to   the  scienter\r\n\nrequirement,  and not to  the nexus claim  made here.   As it\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                         -19-\r\r\n\nhappens,  the Brandon  court also  rejected a  nexus argument\r                                 \r\n\nsomewhat similar  to Walsh's  argument here but  on different\r\n\nfacts.   The intermediaries  with whom defendants  in Brandon\r                                                                         \r\n\ndealt  were  mortgage brokers  who  forwarded the  fraudulent\r\n\napplications to the federally insured bank which individually\r\n\napproved the  loans  and  forwarded  the money  back  to  the\r\n\nmortgage brokers.  See id. at 423, 426-27 &amp; n.16.\r                                      \r\n\n     While the nexus in  Brandon was different--one can argue\r                                            \r\n\nabout  whether it  was  closer or  more remote--Brandon  does\r                                                                   \r\n\nconfirm  that  a  defendant   can  violate  section  1344  by\r\n\nsubmitting the dishonest loan  application to an entity which\r\n\nis not itself a federally insured institution.  Here, Dime-MA\r\n\nwas  practically an  alter ego of  Dime-NY:  it  was a wholly\r\n\nowned  subsidiary   of  Dime-NY;  all  of   the  subsidiary's\r\n\ndirectors and principal officers were officers of the parent;\r\n\nand Dime-MA was  subject to examination  by the same  federal\r\n\nbank  examiners  as  Dime-NY  and reported  its  result  on a\r\n\nconsolidated basis.\r\n\n     Further, focusing  on the  loan process, the  connection\r\n\nbetween  the defendant  and the  federally insured  victim is\r\n\neven  tighter.  Dime-NY provided all of the funds for Dime-MA\r\n\nboth  for  its  operating   expenses  and  to  fund  mortgage\r\n\nclosings.   Dime-NY determined  what loan products  should be\r\n\noffered  and,  on  the closing  of  a  loan  by Dime-MA,  the\r\n\nmortgage  was  immediately assigned  to  Dime-NY, which  then\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                         -20-\r\r\n\nserviced  the  loan.     For  most  practical  purposes,  and\r\n\ncertainly  for  the  purposes  underlying  section 1344,  the\r\n\nmortgage fraud perpetrated against Dime-MA was effectively  a\r\n\nfraud against Dime-NY.\r\n\n     We agree that there must be some outer limits to section\r\n\n1344.   For example, ruinous  fraud directed against  a major\r\n\nbank  customer, but unrelated to  a customer's deposits in or\r\n\nloans from the bank, might  ultimately harm the bank  itself,\r\n\nif only through  loss of a valued customer.   But here, as in\r\n\nBrandon, \"this case presents a situation of direct harm to [a\r                   \r\n\nfederally  insured bank] resulting from a scheme specifically\r\n\ndesigned  to fraudulently  avoid  the  requirements  of  that\r\n\nfederally insured  bank in order to  obtain funds originating\r\n\ndirectly from  [that bank].\"   17 F.3d  at 427 n.16.   As  in\r\n\nBrandon,  we confine our affirmance to  the present facts and\r                   \r\n\ndecline  to   contrive   general  rules   to  govern   myriad\r\n\nvariations.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -21-\r                                         -21-\r\r\n",

His present appeal is primarily directed at procedural issues.   We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh was indicted in 1992, together with four co-defendants, and charged with conspiracy, twenty-nine counts of bank fraud, and twenty-nine counts of false statements.  18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 371, 1344, 1014.   The substance of the indictment was that Walsh carried out a scheme to defraud Dime Savings Bank of New York (\"Dime-NY\").   He did so, according to the charge, by directing his employees to obtain 29 specific loans through the use of deceptions so that customers could purchase condominiums from Walsh and his associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh's trial occurred in February and March 1994.   Taken in the light most favorable to the verdict, United States v. Tuesta-Toro, 29 F.3d 771, 773 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 947, 130 L.Ed.2d 890 (1995), the evidence permitted the jury to find the following.   Walsh was a Cambridge, Massachusetts, city councillor, lawyer, and real estate developer.   With a group of investors, he purchased apartment buildings or complexes, converted the property into condominiums, and sold the condominiums to customers, using the unit sales to pay off the acquisition financing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh ordinarily served as a trustee of the realty trust that acquired the building, acted as legal counsel to the trust, and usually served as the trust's representative in the sale of the individual condominium units.   During 1986, sales of units in one of the projects started to fall behind schedule and the trust began to have difficulty repaying its acquisition loan.   Walsh then discovered that Dime-NY had recently created a wholly owned subsidiary, called Dime Real Estate Services of Massachusetts, Inc.  (\"Dime-MA\"), to originate mortgage loans in Massachusetts.   Dime-MA made mortgage loans available rapidly--with no verification of income, assets or down payments--but the loans required a twenty percent down payment and secondary financing was prohibited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this failing project, and then on two others, Walsh directed his employees to arrange loans from Dime-MA for unit purchasers and to falsify documents submitted to Dime-MA to conceal the existence of secondary financing (and in some cases third mortgages as well).   In the three projects, approximately half the customers defaulted and Dime-MA incurred substantial losses.   An investigation ensued, followed by the indictment already described.   Three of the four co-defendants pleaded guilty;  charges against the fourth co-defendant were abandoned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jury deliberations began on March 22, 1994.   Following the dismissal of a juror during deliberations, the jury (now reduced to 11 members) continued deliberations, and on March 28, 1994, it returned 41 guilty and 18 not guilty verdicts.   Walsh was thereafter sentenced and now appeals.   Most of the claims of error concern the dismissal of the juror and its aftermath, so we begin with that subject, starting with a description of the pertinent events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 23, 1994, a note was received from the jury indicating that one of the jurors wished to meet with the judge, adding:  \"He has several questions and we cannot relate to him in any way, shape, or form.\"   The judge declined to meet with an individual juror, but the following day a court security officer reported that the foreperson was concerned that one of the jurors had become \"mentally unstable.\"   After consulting with counsel, the trial judge interviewed the foreperson, and learned of constant interruptions by \"juror X\", irrelevant statements by juror X about events in his past life, and juror X's efforts to show other jurors written materials consisting of a campaign brochure and a newspaper clipping from his prior efforts to win elective office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After consulting further with counsel, the trial judge interviewed juror X;  as in the judge's interview with the foreperson, counsel and Walsh himself were present.   The judge cautioned juror X not to indicate his views on the merits of the case.   The interview, which began by focusing on the material that the juror brought into the jury room, involved disjointed and rambling comments by juror X.   Juror X also mentioned a self-described \"nervous problem\" and his general discharge from the military.   Some of the questioning was based on questions that had been suggested by the government and defense counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, out of the presence of juror X, the court asked both sides for their position as to whether juror X should be excused, and defense counsel after consultation with Walsh indicated that he \"would not object if the Court decided to keep him or eliminate him....  [Either way] we would move for a mistrial.\"   The government said that it thought the juror was disabled and should be excused.   The trial judge then excused the juror, agreeing that he was \"not a person capable of engaging in rational discussions based upon the evidence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the remaining jurors were sent home for the rest of the day.   The following morning Walsh filed a motion for mistrial, arguing that the ability of the remaining jurors to be impartial and open-minded had been undermined by their exposure to juror X.   No one at this point knew or claimed to know how juror X had proposed to vote.   The court agreed to question the remaining jurors and solicited and received proposed questions from counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then the district judge, in the presence of counsel and the defendant, questioned each of the 11 jurors individually as to whether juror X had discussed the merits prior to the jury's deliberations, had brought material into the jury room, and had discussed his own personal experiences--and whether the juror being questioned could, to the extent that these events had occurred, put them aside and decide the case impartially based on the evidence presented.   Eight of the jurors had been exposed to a campaign brochure and an old newspaper article about one of juror X's campaigns;  all of the jurors had heard juror X discuss his personal experiences;  and three jurors had heard comments from juror X about the merits of the case prior to the start of deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each juror affirmed his or her ability to put aside the campaign material, the personal experiences of juror X, and any comments made by him before deliberations began.   Defense counsel challenged three jurors who had heard comments by juror X before deliberations began, the substance of the comments not being revealed.   With respect to each of the three jurors, the trial judge made findings that the juror was credible in saying that the pre-deliberation comments of juror X would have no effect.   The trial judge then denied a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the request of defense counsel, the trial judge told the jury that it could begin its deliberations from the beginning if it wished;  the court also told the jury not to discount a position taken \"just because [juror X] took it.\"   The jurors then deliberated for the rest of the day.   Returning after a weekend break, they continued deliberations and asked for reinstruction on substantive issues.   Late in the same day, they returned the 41 guilty and 18 not guilty verdicts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Walsh's first claim of error is that the trial court erred in dismissing juror X.   Walsh argues that there was no psychological testing or psychiatric examination of juror X, and the evidence did not show that he was either mentally incompetent or otherwise incapable of engaging in rational decision-making.   In substance, Walsh says that juror X was simply an unpopular, perhaps irritating participant who probably sided with the defendant and whose removal led to a prompt agreement to convict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh did not make a timely objection on this ground.   At the time of the dismissal, his counsel did not object to excusing juror X, or argue for psychiatric testing, or suggest that juror X could be dismissed only if a higher degree of irrationality were shown.   Instead, Walsh made clear his intention to move for a mistrial;  and when the mistrial motion was filed, the ground--inconsistent with the contention now made--was that juror X was someone whose \"psychiatric problems\" had been \"clearly demonstrated\" and whose \"negative influence\" on other jurors was apparent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although, for these reasons, the objection now made is reviewable only for plain error, the dismissal of juror X was not error at all.   Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 23(b) permits the judge to excuse a juror \"for just cause\" during deliberations and to allow the remaining 11 jurors to reach a verdict.   The trial judge has substantial discretion in exercising this responsibility and may remove the juror when \"convinced that the juror's abilities to perform his duties [have] become impaired.\"  United States v. Huntress, 956 F.2d 1309, 1312 (5th Cir.1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 905, 113 S.Ct. 2330, 124 L.Ed.2d 243 (1993).   Similarly, in United States v. Molinares Charris, 822 F.2d 1213, 1223 (1st Cir.1987), we permitted a judge to excuse a juror who had taken a tranquilizer pill and appeared somewhat unstable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge carefully and repeatedly consulted with counsel in determining the course of the inquiry and the questions to be put to juror X.   See United States v. Chorney, 63 F.3d 78, 81 (1st Cir.1995).   The transcript of juror X's voir dire, which need not be repeated in detail, gave the trial judge ample basis for concluding that the juror was not able to perform his duties.   Whether or not juror X was incompetent as a juror under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1865(b)(4), \"just cause\" existed under Rule 23(b) for his removal in this case.   See United States v. Reese, 33 F.3d 166, 172-73 (2d Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 756, 130 L.Ed.2d 655 (1995) (just cause not limited to incompetence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no evidence that the trial judge knew that juror X favored acquittal, if indeed juror X did.   Nor did defense counsel make any such suggestion when he acquiesced in the dismissal of juror X.   If anything, Walsh's mistrial motion suggested that juror X might be hostile to Walsh because Walsh was a lawyer and politician.   Dismissal of a known holdout juror raises an entirely different question.   Compare United States v. Hernandez, 862 F.2d 17 (2d Cir.1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1032, 109 S.Ct. 1170, 103 L.Ed.2d 228 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Walsh's second objection is that even if juror X was properly removed, the court erred in permitting the 11 remaining jurors to return a verdict.   Walsh's broadest grounds for this objection are legal:  he claims that the Constitution does not permit a jury with only 11 jurors to decide a federal criminal case over the objection of a defendant.   He also asserts that Rule 23(b)--which does permit this course--could not be lawfully enacted through the Rules Enabling Act procedures.  18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3771, 3772 (1982).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of these objections was made at the time that the district court was determining whether to permit the 11 remaining jurors to deliberate and, accordingly, both objections are subject to review only for plain error.   It is true that both issues were raised in the trial court after the verdict by a post-verdict motion for dismissal or a new trial.   But the usual rule is that an objection must be made known at the time that the court is making its decision to act, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez-Torres, 980 F.2d 788, 791 (1st Cir.1992), and here the proper time to raise the objections was when the court was deciding whether to continue with 11 jurors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, in any event, the standard of review does not matter as to the constitutional claim because in Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78, 103, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 1907, 26 L.Ed.2d 446 (1970), the Supreme Court said that the 12-member jury was not required by the Constitution and that Congress and the states could select a different number.   We think that Williams effectively answers the claim that 11 jurors are too few.   A number of circuits have held that a jury of 11 can constitutionally decide a federal criminal case, without consent of the parties, where a juror has been removed for cause.   E.g., United States v. Ahmad, 974 F.2d 1163, 1164 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Williams directly rejects the argument that the historical number of jurors is binding--how many would be too few is not an issue in this case--and we think that this conclusion is not altered by Walsh's attempt to rephrase the challenge as a concern for a \"unanimous\" jury.   The Supreme Court has not said whether a less-than-unanimous verdict is acceptable.   Compare Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404, 92 S.Ct. 1628, 32 L.Ed.2d 184 (1972).   But whether it is or not, we think that rendition of a verdict agreed to by all jurors, after one juror with unknown views has been dismissed for cause, is a unanimous verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gist of Walsh's claim under the Rules Enabling Act is that Congress might be able to alter the requisite number from 12 to 11 but that Rule 23(b) was adopted--under the procedures specified by the Rules Enabling Act--by judicial action coupled with Congress' failure to veto the change.   Inaction, says Walsh, is not enough for a fundamental change.   The Second Circuit has concluded, however, that this change can be accomplished through the enabling procedures.  United States v. Stratton, 779 F.2d 820, 831 (2d Cir.1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1162, 106 S.Ct. 2285, 90 L.Ed.2d 726 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rules that are \"strictly procedural\" can be adopted through the Rules Enabling Act without an affirmative vote by Congress, Burlington Northern Railroad Company v. Woods, 480 U.S. 1, 5, 107 S.Ct. 967, 970, 94 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987), and this extends to rules that fall \"within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, [but] are rationally capable of classification as either.\"  Id. (quoting Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 472, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 1144, 14 L.Ed.2d 8 (1965)).   In view of the defendant's failure to make a timely objection, we need not decide this claim outright but are satisfied that the use of the 11-member jury did not constitute \"clear error\" based on the Rules Enabling Act claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.   Walsh did make in timely fashion an objection that this jury was not capable after juror X's discharge of rendering a fair and impartial verdict.   When this issue was raised by Walsh immediately after the discharge, the district court properly undertook \"an adequate inquiry to determine [what had happened and] ... whether it was prejudicial.\"  United States v. Ortiz-Arrigoitia, 996 F.2d 436, 442 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1368, 128 L.Ed.2d 45 (1994).   A trial judge enjoys discretion to determine the scope of the inquiry in deciding whether the jury has been tainted.  United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 258 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 849, 111 S.Ct. 139, 112 L.Ed.2d 106 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already noted, the district court judge separately examined each of the jurors, asking his own questions as well as various questions suggested by counsel.   In each instance, the judge received a forthright declaration that the juror was not going to be affected by the personal comments made by juror X, by materials he had brought into the jury room, or--in the case of three jurors--by the comments that juror X made about the merits before deliberations began.   The judgment of the trial judge, who can appraise the jurors face to face, deserves great weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Walsh now complains that the district judge limited his own questioning unduly--in an effort to avoid learning how the jurors were leaning--Walsh did not press for more detailed inquiry at the time.   The trial judge treads a delicate line in this kind of inquiry.   Assuming arguendo that Walsh is right in saying that Fed.R.Evid. 606(b) does not apply prior to the verdict, there are still obvious good reasons for a trial judge to avoid learning how an individual juror is leaning.  United States v. Rengifo, 789 F.2d 975, 985 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Walsh now argues that there is a substantial chance that the jurors were prejudiced by juror X, nothing in the record makes this at all likely.   In addition to the jurors' own denials, we note that the brochure had nothing directly to do with the trial;  there is no reason to believe that a newspaper article brought in by a juror regarding his prior political campaign contained anything material;  and judging by the voir dire of juror X, his personal experiences were also not germane to the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh now argues that juror X was hostile to lawyers and politicians (Walsh was both) and that this view may have been passed on to the other jurors.   In fact, juror X's brochure was more qualified, expressing (in a description of X's \"positions\") objections to \"the [unspecified] unethical ethics practiced by certain members of the bar\" and \"machine controlled politics and ... [unspecified] dirty tricks.\"   The jurors said that they paid little attention to the pamphlet.   Further, it is Walsh who now takes the position that juror X favored Walsh, which hardly suggests that juror X was denigrating Walsh.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Walsh now complains that by discharging juror X the court led the jury to think that juror X's views should be disregarded.   In fact, the judge expressly cautioned the jury not to discount views simply because they were earlier expressed by juror X.   Walsh also says that the jury should have been directed to start its deliberations anew.   The judge told the jury that it was entitled to start anew.   We think that this was all that was either useful or necessary.   At the time, Walsh raised no objection to the instructions given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Walsh's last claim of error based on the juror X episode relates to a post-trial event.   According to an affidavit from Walsh's secretary, she received a call a week or so after the verdict from someone identifying himself as juror X who said he had been on the defendant's side, that the defendant had been \"railroaded,\" and that she (the secretary) \"would not believe what went on in the jury room.\"   About a month later, Walsh submitted this affidavit in support of a request that the jury and juror X be subject to further voir dire or authorized inquiry by counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court declined to hold such a post-verdict inquiry or to authorize discussions with the jurors or to grant a new trial based on the affidavit.   Walsh now argues that because the parties were barred from unsupervised contact with the jurors after the verdict, United States v. Kepreos, 759 F.2d 961, 967 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 901, 106 S.Ct. 227, 88 L.Ed.2d 227 (1985), the trial court had an obligation to conduct an investigation itself.   The abuse of discretion standard governs this claim, see Boylan, 898 F.2d at 258, and we think that there was no such abuse in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The restrictions on post-verdict contact and the limitations on juror testimony about deliberations, Fed.R.Evid. 606(b), exist to protect important interests in the finality of the verdict and the privacy of the deliberations.   See Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. 107, 120, 107 S.Ct. 2739, 2747-48, 97 L.Ed.2d 90 (1987).   The affidavit contains only general rhetoric from juror X and no specific allegations of misconduct.   Given what the district court already knew about juror X, the telephone call--assuming (as we do) that it came from juror X--did not require any further inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh's brief raises two further issues, both unrelated to juror X.   The first claim relates to the government's admitted failure to turn over certain documents in a timely fashion.   The documents related to Frances Schwartz, a senior attorney working for Walsh who was assigned to the three development projects involved in this case.   Schwartz was indicted with Walsh and was one of the co-defendants who pled guilty to the conspiracy count and testified against Walsh at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct examination, Schwartz gave damaging testimony against Walsh.   In addition to identifying a number of documents and describing the operations of Walsh's office, Schwartz testified to discussions and correspondence with Walsh that--as recounted and interpreted by Schwartz--confirmed Walsh's knowing participation in and direction of the fraud.   Schwartz' testimony was thus quite damaging, although another co-defendant who pled guilty also testified that Walsh knowingly directed the concealment of the secondary financing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in her cross-examination, Schwartz mentioned that she had \"daytimers\" or calendars that she had used to refresh her recollection.   Later, on re-cross, she mentioned that she had allowed the government to review the daytimers and make copies of them.   The defense immediately objected that it had never received the daytimers.   The government said that these daytimers should have been disclosed earlier but had been overlooked when other materials from Schwartz had been made available to Walsh's counsel.   Copies of the daytimers were provided to the defendant later that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a timely motion by Walsh to dismiss the case because of this delay, the trial court denied the motion, finding that Walsh's strategy would not have been substantially different if the daytimers had been disclosed earlier.   The court instructed the jury that the government had failed in its discovery obligation, and it allowed Walsh to recall Schwartz to continue her examination, using the daytimers to try to establish inconsistencies between Schwartz' prior testimony and the daytimers.   Walsh now complains that this was inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court previously considered the issue of delayed disclosure of impeachment material required to be disclosed under the Jencks Act.  United States v. Arboleda, 929 F.2d 858, 862-65 (1st Cir.1991).   We said that the critical question was whether the delay had \"prevented [the material's] effective use by the defense,\" id. at 862, and that some showing of prejudice was required beyond mere assertions that the defendant would have conducted cross-examination differently.  Id. at 864.   Cf. United States v. Lanoue, 71 F.3d 966, 979 (1st Cir.1995).   Delayed disclosure of Brady material is subject to the same rule.   See United States v. Osorio, 929 F.2d 753, 758 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Walsh argues that if his trial counsel had received the daytimers earlier, he would have focused at the outset on the alleged inconsistencies between Schwartz' testimony and the daytimers instead of attempting to cast doubt on the reliability of her memory.   In fact, the initial cross-examination did not focus on Schwartz' memory but rather on her veracity, which the defense counsel sought to undermine by emphasizing her prior drug use and her desire for a lenient sentence.   And when Schwartz was subject to further cross after the daytimers had been produced, Walsh's counsel paid minimal attention to the supposed inconsistencies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh says that when Schwartz was recalled for further cross after the daytimers had been produced, it was too late to crossexamine effectively on inconsistencies because she had been \"well prepared by the government to explain away any inconsistencies.\"   As it happens, there is no evidence of any such discussion after the daytimers first became an issue.   As to preparation prior to the original direct examination, the government was entitled to prepare the witness, and the risk of facing an initially prepared witness would have existed whether or not the daytimers had been produced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh's final claim of error, a claim raised in the district court and rejected there, is that the evidence failed to show that the victim was a federally insured financial institution.   At the time of the fraudulent filings, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344 aimed at schemes to defraud \"a federally chartered or insured financial institution\" or to obtain property owned by, or under the custody or control of such an institution through falsehoods.   See United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 424 n. 11 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 81, 130 L.Ed.2d 34 (1994).   Walsh's argument turns on the fact that Dime-NY was a federally insured bank, but Dime-MA--the immediate maker of the loans--was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government quotes to us in response a statement from Brandon, 17 F.3d at 426, that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>the government does not have to show the alleged scheme was directed solely toward a particular institution;  it is sufficient to show that defendant knowingly executed a fraudulent scheme that exposed a federally insured bank to a risk of loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That language, however, was directed to the scienter requirement, and not to the nexus claim made here.   As it happens, the Brandon court also rejected a nexus argument somewhat similar to Walsh's argument here but on different facts.   The intermediaries with whom defendants in Brandon dealt were mortgage brokers who forwarded the fraudulent applications to the federally insured bank which individually approved the loans and forwarded the money back to the mortgage brokers.   See id. at 423, 426-27 &amp; n. 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the nexus in Brandon was different--one can argue about whether it was closer or more remote--Brandon does confirm that a defendant can violate section 1344 by submitting the dishonest loan application to an entity which is not itself a federally insured institution.   Here, Dime-MA was practically an alter ego of Dime-NY:  it was a wholly owned subsidiary of Dime-NY;  all of the subsidiary's directors and principal officers were officers of the parent;  and Dime-MA was subject to examination by the same federal bank examiners as Dime-NY and reported its result on a consolidated basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, focusing on the loan process, the connection between the defendant and the federally insured victim is even tighter.   Dime-NY provided all of the funds for Dime-MA both for its operating expenses and to fund mortgage closings.   Dime-NY determined what loan products should be offered and, on the closing of a loan by Dime-MA, the mortgage was immediately assigned to Dime-NY, which then serviced the loan.   For most practical purposes, and certainly for the purposes underlying section 1344, the mortgage fraud perpetrated against Dime-MA was effectively a fraud against Dime-NY.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that there must be some outer limits to section 1344.   For example, ruinous fraud directed against a major bank customer, but unrelated to a customer's deposits in or loans from the bank, might ultimately harm the bank itself, if only through loss of a valued customer.   But here, as in Brandon, \"this case presents a situation of direct harm to [a federally insured bank] resulting from a scheme specifically designed to fraudulently avoid the requirements of that federally insured bank in order to obtain funds originating directly from [that bank].\"  17 F.3d at 427 n. 16.   As in Brandon, we confine our affirmance to the present facts and decline to contrive general rules to govern myriad variations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The separate provisions enabling the Supreme Court to prescribe rules of criminal procedure were later repealed and consolidated with the Rules Enabling Act provisions governing the enactment of rules of civil procedure.

His present appeal is primarily directed at procedural issues.   We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh was indicted in 1992, together with four co-defendants, and charged with conspiracy, twenty-nine counts of bank fraud, and twenty-nine counts of false statements.  18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 371, 1344, 1014.   The substance of the indictment was that Walsh carried out a scheme to defraud Dime Savings Bank of New York (\"Dime-NY\").   He did so, according to the charge, by directing his employees to obtain 29 specific loans through the use of deceptions so that customers could purchase condominiums from Walsh and his associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh's trial occurred in February and March 1994.   Taken in the light most favorable to the verdict, United States v. Tuesta-Toro, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195508\"><a href=\"/opinion/195508/united-states-v-tuesta-toro/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span>, 773 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">947</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span> </span>(1995), the evidence permitted the jury to find the following.   Walsh was a Cambridge, Massachusetts, city councillor, lawyer, and real estate developer.   With a group of investors, he purchased apartment buildings or complexes, converted the property into condominiums, and sold the condominiums to customers, using the unit sales to pay off the acquisition financing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh ordinarily served as a trustee of the realty trust that acquired the building, acted as legal counsel to the trust, and usually served as the trust's representative in the sale of the individual condominium units.   During 1986, sales of units in one of the projects started to fall behind schedule and the trust began to have difficulty repaying its acquisition loan.   Walsh then discovered that Dime-NY had recently created a wholly owned subsidiary, called Dime Real Estate Services of Massachusetts, Inc.  (\"Dime-MA\"), to originate mortgage loans in Massachusetts.   Dime-MA made mortgage loans available rapidly--with no verification of income, assets or down payments--but the loans required a twenty percent down payment and secondary financing was prohibited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this failing project, and then on two others, Walsh directed his employees to arrange loans from Dime-MA for unit purchasers and to falsify documents submitted to Dime-MA to conceal the existence of secondary financing (and in some cases third mortgages as well).   In the three projects, approximately half the customers defaulted and Dime-MA incurred substantial losses.   An investigation ensued, followed by the indictment already described.   Three of the four co-defendants pleaded guilty;  charges against the fourth co-defendant were abandoned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jury deliberations began on March 22, 1994.   Following the dismissal of a juror during deliberations, the jury (now reduced to 11 members) continued deliberations, and on March 28, 1994, it returned 41 guilty and 18 not guilty verdicts.   Walsh was thereafter sentenced and now appeals.   Most of the claims of error concern the dismissal of the juror and its aftermath, so we begin with that subject, starting with a description of the pertinent events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 23, 1994, a note was received from the jury indicating that one of the jurors wished to meet with the judge, adding:  \"He has several questions and we cannot relate to him in any way, shape, or form.\"   The judge declined to meet with an individual juror, but the following day a court security officer reported that the foreperson was concerned that one of the jurors had become \"mentally unstable.\"   After consulting with counsel, the trial judge interviewed the foreperson, and learned of constant interruptions by \"juror X\", irrelevant statements by juror X about events in his past life, and juror X's efforts to show other jurors written materials consisting of a campaign brochure and a newspaper clipping from his prior efforts to win elective office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After consulting further with counsel, the trial judge interviewed juror X;  as in the judge's interview with the foreperson, counsel and Walsh himself were present.   The judge cautioned juror X not to indicate his views on the merits of the case.   The interview, which began by focusing on the material that the juror brought into the jury room, involved disjointed and rambling comments by juror X.   Juror X also mentioned a self-described \"nervous problem\" and his general discharge from the military.   Some of the questioning was based on questions that had been suggested by the government and defense counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, out of the presence of juror X, the court asked both sides for their position as to whether juror X should be excused, and defense counsel after consultation with Walsh indicated that he \"would not object if the Court decided to keep him or eliminate him....  [Either way] we would move for a mistrial.\"   The government said that it thought the juror was disabled and should be excused.   The trial judge then excused the juror, agreeing that he was \"not a person capable of engaging in rational discussions based upon the evidence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the remaining jurors were sent home for the rest of the day.   The following morning Walsh filed a motion for mistrial, arguing that the ability of the remaining jurors to be impartial and open-minded had been undermined by their exposure to juror X.   No one at this point knew or claimed to know how juror X had proposed to vote.   The court agreed to question the remaining jurors and solicited and received proposed questions from counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then the district judge, in the presence of counsel and the defendant, questioned each of the 11 jurors individually as to whether juror X had discussed the merits prior to the jury's deliberations, had brought material into the jury room, and had discussed his own personal experiences--and whether the juror being questioned could, to the extent that these events had occurred, put them aside and decide the case impartially based on the evidence presented.   Eight of the jurors had been exposed to a campaign brochure and an old newspaper article about one of juror X's campaigns;  all of the jurors had heard juror X discuss his personal experiences;  and three jurors had heard comments from juror X about the merits of the case prior to the start of deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each juror affirmed his or her ability to put aside the campaign material, the personal experiences of juror X, and any comments made by him before deliberations began.   Defense counsel challenged three jurors who had heard comments by juror X before deliberations began, the substance of the comments not being revealed.   With respect to each of the three jurors, the trial judge made findings that the juror was credible in saying that the pre-deliberation comments of juror X would have no effect.   The trial judge then denied a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the request of defense counsel, the trial judge told the jury that it could begin its deliberations from the beginning if it wished;  the court also told the jury not to discount a position taken \"just because [juror X] took it.\"   The jurors then deliberated for the rest of the day.   Returning after a weekend break, they continued deliberations and asked for reinstruction on substantive issues.   Late in the same day, they returned the 41 guilty and 18 not guilty verdicts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Walsh's first claim of error is that the trial court erred in dismissing juror X.   Walsh argues that there was no psychological testing or psychiatric examination of juror X, and the evidence did not show that he was either mentally incompetent or otherwise incapable of engaging in rational decision-making.   In substance, Walsh says that juror X was simply an unpopular, perhaps irritating participant who probably sided with the defendant and whose removal led to a prompt agreement to convict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh did not make a timely objection on this ground.   At the time of the dismissal, his counsel did not object to excusing juror X, or argue for psychiatric testing, or suggest that juror X could be dismissed only if a higher degree of irrationality were shown.   Instead, Walsh made clear his intention to move for a mistrial;  and when the mistrial motion was filed, the ground--inconsistent with the contention now made--was that juror X was someone whose \"psychiatric problems\" had been \"clearly demonstrated\" and whose \"negative influence\" on other jurors was apparent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although, for these reasons, the objection now made is reviewable only for plain error, the dismissal of juror X was not error at all.   Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 23(b) permits the judge to excuse a juror \"for just cause\" during deliberations and to allow the remaining 11 jurors to reach a verdict.   The trial judge has substantial discretion in exercising this responsibility and may remove the juror when \"convinced that the juror's abilities to perform his duties [have] become impaired.\"  United States v.

The transcript of juror X's voir dire, which need not be repeated in detail, gave the trial judge ample basis for concluding that the juror was not able to perform his duties.   Whether or not juror X was incompetent as a juror under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1865(b)(4), \"just cause\" existed under Rule 23(b) for his removal in this case.   See United States v.

Nor did defense counsel make any such suggestion when he acquiesced in the dismissal of juror X.   If anything, Walsh's mistrial motion suggested that juror X might be hostile to Walsh because Walsh was a lawyer and politician.   Dismissal of a known holdout juror raises an entirely different question.   Compare United States v.

Walsh's second objection is that even if juror X was properly removed, the court erred in permitting the 11 remaining jurors to return a verdict.   Walsh's broadest grounds for this objection are legal:  he claims that the Constitution does not permit a jury with only 11 jurors to decide a federal criminal case over the objection of a defendant.   He also asserts that Rule 23(b)--which does permit this course--could not be lawfully enacted through the Rules Enabling Act procedures.  18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3771, 3772 (1982).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of these objections was made at the time that the district court was determining whether to permit the 11 remaining jurors to deliberate and, accordingly, both objections are subject to review only for plain error.   It is true that both issues were raised in the trial court after the verdict by a post-verdict motion for dismissal or a new trial.   But the usual rule is that an objection must be made known at the time that the court is making its decision to act, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez-Torres, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596102\"><a href=\"/opinion/596102/united-states-v-claudio-gonzalez-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span>, 791 (1st Cir.1992), and here the proper time to raise the objections was when the court was deciding whether to continue with 11 jurors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, in any event, the standard of review does not matter as to the constitutional claim because in Williams v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span> </a></span>(1970), the Supreme Court said that the 12-member jury was not required by the Constitution and that Congress and the states could select a different number.   We think that Williams effectively answers the claim that 11 jurors are too few.   A number of circuits have held that a jury of 11 can constitutionally decide a federal criminal case, without consent of the parties, where a juror has been removed for cause.   E.g., United States v. Ahmad, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590338\"><a href=\"/opinion/590338/united-states-v-abdul-aziz-ahmad-united-states-of-america-v-abdul-aziz/\"><span class=\"volume\">974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1163</span></a></span>, 1164 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Williams directly rejects the argument that the historical number of jurors is binding--how many would be too few is not an issue in this case--and we think that this conclusion is not altered by Walsh's attempt to rephrase the challenge as a concern for a \"unanimous\" jury.   The Supreme Court has not said whether a less-than-unanimous verdict is acceptable.   Compare Apodaca v. Oregon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108539\"><a href=\"/opinion/108539/apodaca-v-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108539\"><a href=\"/opinion/108539/apodaca-v-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But whether it is or not, we think that rendition of a verdict agreed to by all jurors, after one juror with unknown views has been dismissed for cause, is a unanimous verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gist of Walsh's claim under the Rules Enabling Act is that Congress might be able to alter the requisite number from 12 to 11 but that Rule 23(b) was adopted--under the procedures specified by the Rules Enabling Act--by judicial action coupled with Congress' failure to veto the change.   Inaction, says Walsh, is not enough for a fundamental change.   The Second Circuit has concluded, however, that this change can be accomplished through the enabling procedures.  United States v.

Walsh did make in timely fashion an objection that this jury was not capable after juror X's discharge of rendering a fair and impartial verdict.

In each instance, the judge received a forthright declaration that the juror was not going to be affected by the personal comments made by juror X, by materials he had brought into the jury room, or--in the case of three jurors--by the comments that juror X made about the merits before deliberations began.   The judgment of the trial judge, who can appraise the jurors face to face, deserves great weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Walsh now complains that the district judge limited his own questioning unduly--in an effort to avoid learning how the jurors were leaning--Walsh did not press for more detailed inquiry at the time.   The trial judge treads a delicate line in this kind of inquiry.   Assuming arguendo that Walsh is right in saying that Fed.R.Evid. 606(b) does not apply prior to the verdict, there are still obvious good reasons for a trial judge to avoid learning how an individual juror is leaning.  United States v. Rengifo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"469367\"><a href=\"/opinion/469367/united-states-v-felix-rengifo/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></a></span>, 985 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Walsh now argues that there is a substantial chance that the jurors were prejudiced by juror X, nothing in the record makes this at all likely.   In addition to the jurors' own denials, we note that the brochure had nothing directly to do with the trial;  there is no reason to believe that a newspaper article brought in by a juror regarding his prior political campaign contained anything material;  and judging by the voir dire of juror X, his personal experiences were also not germane to the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh now argues that juror X was hostile to lawyers and politicians (Walsh was both) and that this view may have been passed on to the other jurors.   In fact, juror X's brochure was more qualified, expressing (in a description of X's \"positions\") objections to \"the [unspecified] unethical ethics practiced by certain members of the bar\" and \"machine controlled politics and ... [unspecified] dirty tricks.\"   The jurors said that they paid little attention to the pamphlet.   Further, it is Walsh who now takes the position that juror X favored Walsh, which hardly suggests that juror X was denigrating Walsh.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Walsh now complains that by discharging juror X the court led the jury to think that juror X's views should be disregarded.   In fact, the judge expressly cautioned the jury not to discount views simply because they were earlier expressed by juror X.   Walsh also says that the jury should have been directed to start its deliberations anew.   The judge told the jury that it was entitled to start anew.   We think that this was all that was either useful or necessary.   At the time, Walsh raised no objection to the instructions given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Walsh's last claim of error based on the juror X episode relates to a post-trial event.   According to an affidavit from Walsh's secretary, she received a call a week or so after the verdict from someone identifying himself as juror X who said he had been on the defendant's side, that the defendant had been \"railroaded,\" and that she (the secretary) \"would not believe what went on in the jury room.\"   About a month later, Walsh submitted this affidavit in support of a request that the jury and juror X be subject to further voir dire or authorized inquiry by counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court declined to hold such a post-verdict inquiry or to authorize discussions with the jurors or to grant a new trial based on the affidavit.   Walsh now argues that because the parties were barred from unsupervised contact with the jurors after the verdict, United States v.

Given what the district court already knew about juror X, the telephone call--assuming (as we do) that it came from juror X--did not require any further inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh's brief raises two further issues, both unrelated to juror X.   The first claim relates to the government's admitted failure to turn over certain documents in a timely fashion.   The documents related to Frances Schwartz, a senior attorney working for Walsh who was assigned to the three development projects involved in this case.   Schwartz was indicted with Walsh and was one of the co-defendants who pled guilty to the conspiracy count and testified against Walsh at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct examination, Schwartz gave damaging testimony against Walsh.   In addition to identifying a number of documents and describing the operations of Walsh's office, Schwartz testified to discussions and correspondence with Walsh that--as recounted and interpreted by Schwartz--confirmed Walsh's knowing participation in and direction of the fraud.   Schwartz' testimony was thus quite damaging, although another co-defendant who pled guilty also testified that Walsh knowingly directed the concealment of the secondary financing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in her cross-examination, Schwartz mentioned that she had \"daytimers\" or calendars that she had used to refresh her recollection.   Later, on re-cross, she mentioned that she had allowed the government to review the daytimers and make copies of them.   The defense immediately objected that it had never received the daytimers.   The government said that these daytimers should have been disclosed earlier but had been overlooked when other materials from Schwartz had been made available to Walsh's counsel.   Copies of the daytimers were provided to the defendant later that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a timely motion by Walsh to dismiss the case because of this delay, the trial court denied the motion, finding that Walsh's strategy would not have been substantially different if the daytimers had been disclosed earlier.   The court instructed the jury that the government had failed in its discovery obligation, and it allowed Walsh to recall Schwartz to continue her examination, using the daytimers to try to establish inconsistencies between Schwartz' prior testimony and the daytimers.   Walsh now complains that this was inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court previously considered the issue of delayed disclosure of impeachment material required to be disclosed under the Jencks Act.

In fact, the initial cross-examination did not focus on Schwartz' memory but rather on her veracity, which the defense counsel sought to undermine by emphasizing her prior drug use and her desire for a lenient sentence.   And when Schwartz was subject to further cross after the daytimers had been produced, Walsh's counsel paid minimal attention to the supposed inconsistencies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh says that when Schwartz was recalled for further cross after the daytimers had been produced, it was too late to crossexamine effectively on inconsistencies because she had been \"well prepared by the government to explain away any inconsistencies.\"   As it happens, there is no evidence of any such discussion after the daytimers first became an issue.   As to preparation prior to the original direct examination, the government was entitled to prepare the witness, and the risk of facing an initially prepared witness would have existed whether or not the daytimers had been produced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh's final claim of error, a claim raised in the district court and rejected there, is that the evidence failed to show that the victim was a federally insured financial institution.   At the time of the fraudulent filings, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344 aimed at schemes to defraud \"a federally chartered or insured financial institution\" or to obtain property owned by, or under the custody or control of such an institution through falsehoods.   See United States v. Brandon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span>, 424 n. 11 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span> </span>(1994).   Walsh's argument turns on the fact that Dime-NY was a federally insured bank, but Dime-MA--the immediate maker of the loans--was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government quotes to us in response a statement from <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Brandon,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span>, that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>the government does not have to show the alleged scheme was directed solely toward a particular institution;  it is sufficient to show that defendant knowingly executed a fraudulent scheme that exposed a federally insured bank to a risk of loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That language, however, was directed to the scienter requirement, and not to the nexus claim made here.   As it happens, the Brandon court also rejected a nexus argument somewhat similar to Walsh's argument here but on different facts.   The intermediaries with whom defendants in Brandon dealt were mortgage brokers who forwarded the fraudulent applications to the federally insured bank which individually approved the loans and forwarded the money back to the mortgage brokers.   See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 423, </a></span>426-27 &amp; n. 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the nexus in Brandon was different--one can argue about whether it was closer or more remote--Brandon does confirm that a defendant can violate section 1344 by submitting the dishonest loan application to an entity which is not itself a federally insured institution.   Here, Dime-MA was practically an alter ego of Dime-NY:  it was a wholly owned subsidiary of Dime-NY;  all of the subsidiary's directors and principal officers were officers of the parent;  and Dime-MA was subject to examination by the same federal bank examiners as Dime-NY and reported its result on a consolidated basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, focusing on the loan process, the connection between the defendant and the federally insured victim is even tighter.   Dime-NY provided all of the funds for Dime-MA both for its operating expenses and to fund mortgage closings.   Dime-NY determined what loan products should be offered and, on the closing of a loan by Dime-MA, the mortgage was immediately assigned to Dime-NY, which then serviced the loan.   For most practical purposes, and certainly for the purposes underlying section 1344, the mortgage fraud perpetrated against Dime-MA was effectively a fraud against Dime-NY.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that there must be some outer limits to section 1344.   For example, ruinous fraud directed against a major bank customer, but unrelated to a customer's deposits in or loans from the bank, might ultimately harm the bank itself, if only through loss of a valued customer.   But here, as in Brandon, \"this case presents a situation of direct harm to [a federally insured bank] resulting from a scheme specifically designed to fraudulently avoid the requirements of that federally insured bank in order to obtain funds originating directly from [that <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">bank].\"</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">427</span> </a></span>n. 16.   As in Brandon, we confine our affirmance to the present facts and decline to contrive general rules to govern myriad variations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The separate provisions enabling the Supreme Court to prescribe rules of criminal procedure were later repealed and consolidated with the Rules Enabling Act provisions governing the enactment of rules of civil procedure.
