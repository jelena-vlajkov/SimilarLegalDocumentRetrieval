Stephanie  Luongo  sued Lawner  Reingold\r                               \r\n\nBritton   &amp;  Partners,   her  former   employer,  for   pregnancy\r\n\ndiscrimination, alleging  she was  targeted for layoff  under the\r\n\ncompany's  downsizing plan  because both  she and  her supervisor\r\n\nwere pregnant at the  time and their pregnancy leaves  would have\r\n\noverlapped  by  approximately one  month,  crippling their  small\r\n\ndepartment.   Lawner  Reingold filed  a summary  judgment motion,\r\n\nproperly supported by several affidavits, arguing that the reason\r\n\nLuongo was laid off was not discriminatory, but merely part  of a\r\n\nthird wave of dismissals designed to lower the operating costs of\r\n\nthe advertising agency  and make it leaner  and more competitive.\r\n\nAfter  examining the  case  in light  of  the analytic  framework\r\n\nestablished by  McDonnell Douglas  Corp. v.

The court found that Luongo established a prima facie\r\n\ncase of  sex discrimination,  that Lawner Reingold  articulated a\r\n\nlegitimate,  non-discriminatory  reason for  the job  action, and\r\n\nthat Luongo  then failed to  introduce sufficient evidence  for a\r\n\nrational fact finder to  conclude that the employer's articulated\r\n\nreason  for  her  discharge  was a  pretext  for  discrimination.\r\n\nUnhappy  with the  district  court's decision,  Luongo filed  the\r\n\npresent appeal.\r\n\n          We review the summary judgment  ruling in this case  de\r\n\nnovo \"to  determine whether the   pleadings, depositions, answers\r\n\nto interrogatories, and  admissions on file,   together with  the\r\n\naffidavits .  . . show[s]  there is  no genuine issue  as to  any\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nmaterial fact and [that] the moving party is entitled to judgment\r\n\nas a matter of   law.\"  Simon v.

We examine  the evidence in the  light most favorable to\r\n\nplaintiff-appellant to determine whether there is a genuine issue\r\n\nof  material  fact which  would warrant  a  trial on  the merits.\r\n\nV lez-G mez  v.

A  \"genuine\"  issue is  one  that properly  can  be\r\n\nresolved only by a   finder of fact because it may  reasonably be\r\n\nresolved in  favor of either   party.  A \"material\"  issue is one\r\n\nthat might affect  the  outcome of  the suit under  the governing\r\n\nlaw.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,  Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).\r                                                \r\n\nThe  nonmovant may  not  defeat a  properly supported  motion for\r\n\nsummary  judgment  by relying upon  mere allegations or  evidence\r\n\nthat  is  less than   significantly  probative.
