Plaintiff-appellant  Joseph  Anthony\r                                 \r\n\nFausto   appeals  pro  se  from  entry  of  summary  judgment\r                                     \r\n\ndisposing  of  his  claim that  the  Air  Force discriminated\r\n\nagainst  him, based on his gender, when it failed to hire him\r\n\nas an administrative officer.  For the following  reasons, we\r\n\naffirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n     The  relevant background  is  fully  and accurately  set\r\n\nforth in the  district court's memorandum  and order, and  we\r\n\nneed only  provide a  brief summary here.   On May  29, 1984,\r\n\nFausto applied  for the position  of Administrative  Officer,\r\n\nGS-11,  at an  Air  Force  facility  located  in  Wilmington,\r\n\nMassachusetts.  The  evidence in the record  establishes that\r\n\nFausto  was  one  of eight  candidates  interviewed  for this\r\n\nposition;  that  the  candidates   were  scored  after  their\r\n\ninterviews; that Fausto  received the lowest score;  and that\r\n\nFausto's low score was due,  in part, to his poor performance\r\n\nduring his oral interview.1   There is some evidence that the\r\n\nhighest scoring candidate,  a woman, was offered the  job and\r\n\ndeclined for  personal reasons.   In any  event, none  of the\r\n\nremaining  candidates was offered the position.  Instead, the\r\n\njob  was  restructured  as  a  GS-9  developmental  position,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Fausto suggests,  without  evidentiary  basis,  that  the\r\nother  interviewees  never  existed.    In  addition,  Fausto\r\nsubmitted his own affidavit proclaiming that he had performed\r\nwell during his oral interview.  \r\r\n\nreannounced, and  eventually offered to Rosemary  Tremblay, a\r\n\nwoman   who  had   been  shouldering   many   of  the   job's\r\n\nresponsibilities for some months.\r\n\n     Having  exhausted  his administrative  remedies,  Fausto\r\n\nfiled suit in  the district court  against defendant-appellee\r\n\nJohn J.  Welch,  Jr.,  Acting Secretary  of  the  Air  Force,\r\n\nalleging discriminatory  treatment in violation of  Title VII\r\n\nof the  Civil Rights Act  of 1964, 42  U.S.C.   2000e.   Both\r\n\nparties  moved for  summary judgment.    The district  court,\r\n\nrelying  on the  three-stage,  burden-shifting framework  set\r\n\nforth  in McDonnell  Douglas  Corp. v.  Green,  411 U.S.  792\r                                                         \r\n\n(1973), found that Fausto had established a prima facie  case\r                                                                   \r\n\nof discrimination.   The court  found, however, that  the Air\r\n\nForce  successfully   had   rebutted   the   presumption   of\r\n\ndiscrimination  arising from  Fausto's  prima  facie case  by\r                                                                \r\n\narticulating a legitimate,  non-discriminatory reason for its\r\n\ndecision,  namely, Fausto's low  candidate ranking.  Finally,\r\n\nthe court concluded that Fausto had failed to submit evidence\r\n\nsufficient  to permit a  reasonable factfinder to  infer that\r\n\nthe Air Force discriminated against him because he is a male.\r\n\nAccordingly, the court  granted summary judgment in  favor of\r\n\nthe Air Force.2\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Fausto  also alleges  in  his complaint  that he  was the\r\nvictim of retaliation  for filing a complaint with  the Equal\r\nEmployment  Opportunity  Commission.     The  district  court\r\ngranted summary judgment  for the Air Force on  this claim on\r\nthe ground that  Fausto failed to present a  prima facie case\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n     The basic order and allocation  of burdens of proof in a\r\n\nTitle VII  discriminatory treatment  case was  limned by  the\r\n\nSupreme Court in  McDonnell Douglas, 441 U.S.  at 802-05, and\r                                               \r\n\nexpounded in St. Mary's Honor Ctr.  v. Hicks, 113 S. Ct. 2742\r                                                        \r\n\n(1993).   Where,  as here,  there  is no  direct evidence  of\r\n\ndiscrimination,  the plaintiff  bears the  initial burden  of\r\n\nestablishing a prima facie case of discrimination.  See Smith\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Stratus  Computer, Inc., 40  F.3d 11, 15 (1st  Cir. 1994),\r                                      \r\n\ncert.  denied, 115  S. Ct.  1958  (1995).   If the  plaintiff\r                         \r\n\nestablishes  a prima  facie case,  the burden  shifts to  the\r                                       \r\n\nemployer  to  articulate   a  legitimate,  non-discriminatory\r\n\nreason for its  decision.  See Mesnick v.  General Elec. Co.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n950 F.2d 816, 823 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 985\r                                                           \r\n\n(1992).    Finally, if  the  employer meets  its  burden, the\r\n\nplaintiff must introduce sufficient evidence to show that the\r\n\nemployer's  justification  is  a pretext  and  that  the true\r\n\nreason for its action is  discriminatory.  See Smith, 40 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\nat 16.   We  review the  grant of  summary judgment  de novo,\r                                                                        \r\n\nviewing   the  evidence,   and   the  reasonable   inferences\r\n\ntherefrom, in  a light most favorable to  the party resisting\r\n\nsummary  judgment.   Woodman v.  Haemonetics  Corp., 51  F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n1087, 1091 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nof retaliation.   Fausto does not argue that  this was error,\r\nand we deem the issue waived.  \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n     A.  Defendant's Burden of Production\r\n\n     Once  Fausto  made out  a  prima  facie case  of  gender\r                                                        \r\n\ndiscrimination,  the Air Force  was required to  articulate a\r\n\nlegitimate,   non-discriminatory  reason   for  its   adverse\r\n\ndecision.  Fausto argues that, in the procedural posture of a\r\n\nmotion for summary judgment, the district court impermissibly\r\n\njudged  the credibility of  the affiants in  determining that\r\n\nthe Air Force met its  burden.  Fausto also contends, relying\r\n\non  Milton  v. Weinberger,  645  F.2d 1070,  1079  (D.C. Cir.\r                                     \r\n\n1981), that his  low score, relative to the  other candidates\r\n\nwho were interviewed,  could not be used to  justify his non-\r\n\nselection.  These arguments fail.\r\n\n    First, an employer's burden at the second stage is merely\r\n\na burden of production; it must introduce evidence  which, if\r\n\n\"taken as true,\"  would permit an inference that  there was a\r\n\nnon-discriminatory reason for the adverse action.  Hicks, 113\r                                                                    \r\n\nS. Ct.  at 2748.   Second, Milton is inapposite.   In Milton,\r                                                                        \r\n\nthe  District  of  Columbia Circuit  held  that  the relative\r\n\nrankings of  candidates before  their  interviews could  not,\r\n\nalone, serve as a legitimate  reason for the non-selection of\r\n\nthe  appellants  where  it was  apparent  that  the selecting\r\n\nofficial did  not rely solely  on these rankings to  make his\r\n\ndecision.   See Milton,  645 F.2d at  1079.   In the  instant\r                                  \r\n\ncase, the relative  rankings introduced by the Air Force were\r\n\nfinal  rankings of  the  candidates after  their  interviews.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nMoreover,   the   Air   Force   introduced   other   evidence\r\n\ndemonstrating that Fausto's  interview went  poorly and  that\r\n\nthe  selecting officials believed  he lacked the  capacity to\r\n\nperform the job.  Under  the circumstances, the Air Force met\r\n\nits burden of production.\r\n\n     B.  Plaintiff's Burden of Showing Discriminatory Animus\r\n\n     At  the third and  final stage,  Fausto was  required to\r\n\nproffer  sufficient evidence to  prove by a  preponderance of\r\n\nthe evidence that the Air Force's  justification was merely a\r\n\npretext for gender discrimination.  Woodman, 51 F.3d at 1091-\r                                                       \r\n\n92.  We are persuaded that Fausto  failed to meet this burden\r\n\nessentially for the reasons stated by the district court.  We\r\n\nadd the following.\r\n\n     Contrary to Fausto's  suggestion, the fact that  the Air\r\n\nForce   redacted  the  names  of  the  other  candidates  and\r\n\nidentified them  solely  by their  sex  for purposes  of  its\r\n\nsummary judgment  motion  does not support an inference  that\r\n\nthese  candidates  did not  exist or  that their  scores were\r\n\nfabricated.  See  Byrd v. Ronayne, 1995 WL 461827  at *3 (1st\r                                             \r\n\nCir. Aug.  9, 1995) (summary  judgment cannot be  defeated by\r\n\nreliance \"upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences,\r\n\nand  unsupported speculation\"  (quoting Medina-Munoz  v. R.J.\r                                                                         \r\n\nReynold Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990))). \r                               \r\n\n     We also reject Fausto's suggestion that summary judgment\r\n\nwas improper  because he  submitted evidence  from which,  he\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nclaims, it could be inferred that he was better qualified for\r\n\nthe  position  of administrative  officer  than  was Rosemary\r\n\nTremblay.3   The  unrebutted  evidence  that  both  male  and\r\n\nfemale  candidates  were  passed  over  in  the  decision  to\r\n\nrestructure the  job  makes  improbable  the  inference  that\r\n\nTremblay was offered the position at a lower grade because of\r\n\nher gender.   More importantly, the unrebutted  evidence that\r\n\nFausto  had  the  lowest  ranking  of  the  eight  candidates\r\n\ninterviewed  renders  implausible the  inference  that gender\r\n\nbias was  a motivating factor  in the decision not  to select\r\n\nhim.  Cf. Gilty v. Village  of Oak Park, 919 F.2d 1247,  1253\r                                                   \r\n\n(7th  Cir. 1990) (upholding  grant of summary  judgment where\r\n\nrace discrimination claimant would have placed no higher than\r\n\nfifth  on the  eligibility list  even in  the absence  of the\r\n\nalleged discrimination).\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.

On May 29, 1984, Fausto applied for the position of Administrative Officer, GS-11, at an Air Force facility located in Wilmington, Massachusetts.  The evidence in the record establishes that Fausto was one of eight candidates interviewed for this position;  that the candidates were scored after their interviews;  that Fausto received the lowest score;  and that Fausto's low score was due, in part, to his poor performance during his oral interview.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  There is some evidence that the highest scoring candidate, a woman, was offered the job and declined for personal reasons.  In any event, none of the remaining candidates was offered the position.  Instead, the job was restructured as a GS-9 developmental position, reannounced, and eventually offered to Rosemary Tremblay, a woman who had been shouldering many of the job's responsibilities for some months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having exhausted his administrative remedies, Fausto filed suit in the district court against defendant-appellee John J. Welch, Jr., Acting Secretary of the Air Force, alleging discriminatory treatment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e.  Both parties moved for summary judgment.  The district court, relying on the three-stage, burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), found that Fausto had established a prima facie case of discrimination.  The court found, however, that the Air Force successfully had rebutted the presumption of discrimination arising from Fausto's prima facie case by articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its decision, namely, Fausto's low candidate ranking.  Finally, the court concluded that Fausto had failed to submit evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to infer that the Air Force discriminated against him because he is a male.  Accordingly, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the Air Force.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basic order and allocation of burdens of proof in a Title VII discriminatory treatment case was limned by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas, 441 U.S. at 802-05, and expounded in St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 113 S.Ct. 2742 (1993).  Where, as here, there is no direct evidence of discrimination, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination.  See Smith v. Stratus Computer, Inc., 40 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 1958 (1995).  If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its decision.  See Mesnick v. General Elec.

Fausto also contends, relying on Milton v. Weinberger, 645 F.2d 1070, 1079 (D.C.Cir.1981), that his low score, relative to the other candidates who were interviewed, could not be used to justify his non-selection.

In Milton, the District of Columbia Circuit held that the relative rankings of candidates before their interviews could not, alone, serve as a legitimate reason for the non-selection of the appellants where it was apparent that the selecting official did not rely solely on these rankings to make his decision.  See Milton, 645 F.2d at 1079.  In the instant case, the relative rankings introduced by the Air Force were final rankings of the candidates after their interviews.

For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant background is fully and accurately set forth in the district court's memorandum and order, and we need only provide a brief summary here.  On May 29, 1984, Fausto applied for the position of Administrative Officer, GS-11, at an Air Force facility located in Wilmington, Massachusetts.  The evidence in the record establishes that Fausto was one of eight candidates interviewed for this position;  that the candidates were scored after their interviews;  that Fausto received the lowest score;  and that Fausto's low score was due, in part, to his poor performance during his oral interview.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  There is some evidence that the highest scoring candidate, a woman, was offered the job and declined for personal reasons.  In any event, none of the remaining candidates was offered the position.  Instead, the job was restructured as a GS-9 developmental position, reannounced, and eventually offered to Rosemary Tremblay, a woman who had been shouldering many of the job's responsibilities for some months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having exhausted his administrative remedies, Fausto filed suit in the district court against defendant-appellee John J. Welch, Jr., Acting Secretary of the Air Force, alleging discriminatory treatment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e.  Both parties moved for summary judgment.  The district court, relying on the three-stage, burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span> </a></span>(1973), found that Fausto had established a prima facie case of discrimination.  The court found, however, that the Air Force successfully had rebutted the presumption of discrimination arising from Fausto's prima facie case by articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its decision, namely, Fausto's low candidate ranking.  Finally, the court concluded that Fausto had failed to submit evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to infer that the Air Force discriminated against him because he is a male.  Accordingly, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the Air Force.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basic order and allocation of burdens of proof in a Title VII discriminatory treatment case was limned by the Supreme Court in McDonnell <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Douglas,</span> <span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">802-05</span></span>, and expounded in St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2742</span> </a></span>(1993).  Where, as here, there is no direct evidence of discrimination, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination.  See Smith v. Stratus Computer, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195745\"><a href=\"/opinion/195745/smith-v-stratus-computers/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1958</span> </span>(1995).  If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its decision.  See Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 823 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span> </span>(1992).  Finally, if the employer meets its burden, the plaintiff must introduce sufficient evidence to show that the employer's justification is a pretext and that the true reason for its action is discriminatory.
