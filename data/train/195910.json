The sole issue on appeal is whether the\n\noath  administered to appellant  during the  course of  the fraud\n\ninvestigation conducted by the United States Department of Health\n\nand Human Services (\"HHS\") was authorized by law.  We affirm. \n\n          The district  court imposed a two-point  upward adjust-\n\nment for attempting  to obstruct or impede  the administration of\n\njustice  during   the  HHS  fraud investigation.

U.S.S.G.    3C1.1, comment. (n.3(b)).1   The only\n\nquestion raised  is whether the HHS inspectors were authorized to\n\nadminister  an oath to appellant.   See United  States v.

The  Inspector General of  HHS is\n\nempowered  \"to administer  to or  take from  any person  an oath,\n\naffirmation, or  affidavit whenever necessary  in the performance\r                                                                           \n\nof the functions assigned by this Act.\"  Id.    6(a)(5) (emphasis\r                                                      \n\nadded).  \n\n          Appellant's lone argument is that it was not \"necessary\n\nin  the  performance of  the functions\"  assigned  to the  HHS to\n\nadminister  an oath in investigating this case.  This claim rings\n\nespecially hollow here, since appellant  had lied to HHS investi-\n\ngators  during  an earlier  interview,  thereby  enabling him  to\n\ncontinue for  almost two  additional years to  receive disability\n\npayments to which he was not entitled.  \n\n          As appellant was subject to a duly administered oath at\n\nthe time he willfully made materially false statements to the HHS\n\ninspectors, the two-point enhancement  under U.S.S.G.   3C1.1 was\n\nentirely proper.  \n\n          AFFIRMED.\r                    AFFIRMED\r                            \n\n                                3\r\r\n",
