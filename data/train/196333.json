Ernest C.

We  affirm the order of the  district court\r                           \r\n\ndismissing  the  claims  of  plaintiff/appellant  Nina Sundel\r\n\nessentially for the reasons given  by the magistrate judge in\r\n\nhis report and recommendation, dated December 7, 1994.\r\n\n     We also  deny Sundel's  request that  she be  allowed to\r\n\namend her complaint on appeal.  \r\n\n     First,  having elected not to  amend her complaint as of\r\n\nright  before the district  court, Sundel now  must show that\r\n\nher case fits into  the \"long-odds exception\" to the  general\r\n\nrule  that  failure to  seek amendment  below bars  relief on\r\n\nappeal. Dartmouth  Review v. Dartmouth College,  889 F.2d 13,\r                                                          \r\n\n23 (1st  Cir. 1989).   The  only special  circumstance facing\r\n\nSundel below  was her pro se status.  However, \"pro se status\r                                                                  \r\n\n[does  not] absolve  [a  litigant] from  compliance with  the\r\n\nFederal Rules  of Procedure.\"   United States v.  Heller, 957\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  26, 31 (1st Cir. 1992) (quoting Feinstein v. Moses, 951\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 1991)).  Therefore, once the magistrate\r\n\njudge  recommended that  Sundel's Bivens claims  be dismissed\r                                                    \r\n\nbecause  of  \"failure  to make  specific  allegations against\r\n\nindividual  defendants,\"  Sundel  should  have  exercised her\r\n\nright to amend her pleadings,  see Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\nat  22 (plaintiff has right to amend pleading after motion to\r\n\ndismiss,  because  motion  to  dismiss is  not  a  responsive\r\n\npleading within  the meaning of Rule 15), in order to add the\r\n\nnecessary specific allegations.   Nor can Sundel contend that\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nshe  was  unaware  of  this information  since  she  included\r\n\nspecific allegations against individuals in her  objection to\r\n\nthe report and recommendation of the magistrate judge. \r\n\n     Second, allowing  Sundel to  amend  her complaint  would\r\n\nserve no purpose in  this case.  The only  potentially viable\r\n\nclaims arising out of the facts alleged in Sundel's complaint\r\n\nare  the Bivens  claims  against individual  officers of  the\r                           \r\n\ngovernment.    Since  her  original complaint  was  dismissed\r\n\nwithout prejudice  to her filing  such claims, she  may still\r\n\npursue any such actions via a properly filed new complaint.  \r\n\n     On the other  hand, if, as Sundel suggests,  the statute\r\n\nof limitations has already run on her Bivens claims, allowing\r                                                        \r\n\nher to amend her original complaint would still not  overcome\r\n\nthe  time  bar  unless  the amendment  related  back  to  her\r\n\noriginal  complaint, pursuant  to Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 15(c)(3).\r\n\nHowever, Rule  15(c) requires  that, within  120 days of  the\r\n\nfiling of the original complaint, \"the party to be brought in\r\n\nby  amendment  .  . .  [have]  received  such  notice of  the\r\n\ninstitution  of  the  action  that  the  party  will  not  be\r\n\nprejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits.\"    In the\r\n\ninstant  case,  the  record  indicates  that  the  individual\r\n\ngovernment  agents  have   never  been  served  process   nor\r\n\notherwise been provided notice of  the action.  Absent timely\r\n\nnotice, Rule  15(c)'s relation back provisions  do not apply.\r\n\nWilson v. United  States, 23  F.3d 559, 563  (1st Cir.  1994)\r                                    \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n(quoting  Rule  15(c)).    Moreover,  Rule  15(c)  ordinarily\r\n\napplies only when \"the proper defendant is already before the\r\n\ncourt  and the  effect is  merely to  correct the  name under\r\n\nwhich he is  sued.  But  a new defendant  cannot normally  be\r\n\nsubstituted  or  added  by  amendment after  the  statute  of\r\n\nlimitations has run.\"  Id. (quoting Worthington v.  Wilson, 8\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 1253, 1256  (7th Cir. 1993)).   Consequently, since  the\r\n\nindividual defendants were  never before the district  court,\r\n\nthey  cannot be added if  the statute of  limitations has now\r\n\nrun.\r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. R. 27.1.\r                               \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
