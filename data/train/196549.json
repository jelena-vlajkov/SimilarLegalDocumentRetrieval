In  1994, plaintiff/appellant  Rodolfo A.\r                            \r\n\nVargas brought  suit alleging  that,  while employed  at  the\r\n\nRhode Island Department of Environmental Management [DEM], he\r\n\nhad been subject to racial harassment and had been terminated\r\n\nbecause of  his national origin,  both in violation  of Title\r\n\nVII of the  Civil Rights Act  of 1964, 42  U.S.C.   2000e  et\r                                                                         \r\n\nseq.   Judgment was entered  for defendant after  a three day\r               \r\n\nbench  trial  and affirmed  by  this  court.   Subsequent  to\r\n\nentering judgment,  the district court granted  the motion of\r\n\nthe   defendant/appellee  for  attorneys'   fees  and  costs,\r\n\npurusant  to 42  U.S.C.    2000e-5(k).   Vargas'  appeals the\r\n\ngrant of fees and costs.  We affirm.\r\n\n     A  prevailing  defendant  in  a  civil  rights  case  is\r\n\nentitled  to  fees  and  costs  only  if  the  defendant  can\r\n\nestablish that  the plaintiff's suit  \"was totally unfounded,\r\n\nfrivolous,  or  otherwise unreasonable.\"    Case Marie  Hogar\r                                                                         \r\n\nGeriatrico, Inc. v. Rivera-Santos, 38 F.3d 615, 618 (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1994) (citing cases).  Given that the district court is \"most\r\n\nintimately familiar with the case and its nuances,\" Foster v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMydas Associates,  Inc., 943 F.2d  139, 144 (1st  Cir. 1991),\r                                   \r\n\nand thus  in  the  best position  to  determine  whether  fee\r\n\nshifting is warranted, we  review an award of fees  and costs\r\n\nin a civil  rights case  only for abuse  of discretion,  Case\r                                                                         \r\n\nMarie,  38 F.3d  at 618.   Nonetheless,  we do  require \"that\r                 \r\n\nconcrete  findings of fact be  made and that  the court below\r\n\nsupply a  clear explanation  of  the reasons  undergirding  a\r\n\nparticular fee award.\"  Peckham v. Continental Cas. Ins. Co.,\r                                                                        \r\r\n\n895 F.2d 830, 842 (1st Cir. 1990).  In addition, we have held\r\n\nthat \"an award  of attorney's fees to a  prevailing defendant\r\n\nmust not  be oblivious of a  plaintiff's financial capacity.\"\r\n\nCharves  v. Western  Union Telegraph Co.,  711 F.2d  462, 465\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1983).\r\n\n     In  the instant  case,  the district  court conducted  a\r\n\ncareful  review  of all  the  evidence  put  forward  by  the\r\n\nplaintiff and  then determined that there  was \"absolutely no\r\n\nfactual  basis for finding  that the  Defendant intentionally\r\n\ndiscriminated  against  the Plaintiff  or  to  find that  any\r\n\ntreatment  the   Plaintiff  received   was   based  on   some\r\n\ndiscriminatory  animus because  of his  race.\"   We find  the\r\n\nreasons given by the district court for its fee shifting both\r\n\nclear and  firmly supported by  the record.   Moreover, after\r\n\nmaking its award, the court afforded plaintiff three separate\r\n\nopportunities to  present evidence of any  limited ability to\r\n\npay the award.  Nevertheless, plaintiff, despite his claim of\r\n\nlimited financial resources, steadfastedly refused to provide\r\n\nthe  court  with  any   documentation  as  to  his  financial\r\n\ncondition.  Having refused to meet the burden of establishing\r\n\nhis  financial  condition,  plaintiff   cannot  be  heard  to\r\n\ncomplain  about any failure to  adjust the award  in light of\r\n\nthat condition.  See Case Marie, 38 F.3d at 618 n.2.  \r                                           \r\n\n     Finally, we  find no support  in the record  for Vargas'\r\n\nclaim of judicial bias.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n     The order of the district court is affirmed.* \r                                                            \r\n\n                \r                            \r\n\n* Appellee requests sanctions  against appellant, pursuant to  Fed. R.\r\nApp. P. 38, for bringing a frivolous appeal.  However, Fed. R.
