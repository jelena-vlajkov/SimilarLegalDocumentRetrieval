This appeal has its origin in a\r                                       \n\nsettlement agreement that purported to resolve the claims and\n\ncounterclaims   of   approximately   a  dozen   corporations,\n\npartnerships, and  other business  entities in at  least four\n\nseparate lawsuits.   The settlement  went awry; and  one side\n\nsought  to enforce  consent  judgments filed  as part  of the\n\nsettlement.  The  subject of those  judgments sought to  undo\n\nthem  and now appeals from the district court's denial of his\n\nefforts.\n\n                       I.  THE HISTORY\n\n     The  appellant Marshall  S. Sterman (\"Sterman\")  and his\n\nnow-  deceased partner  Lester  Grant owned  or controlled  a\n\nnumber  of business  entities (\"the  Sterman entities\")  that\n\nengaged in  real estate development  projects in a  number of\n\nstates in  the late 1980s and early  1990s.  To finance these\n\nprojects, the Sterman entities entered into transactions with\n\nappellee Xerox Financial Services Life Insurance Company  and\n\nappellee Van  Kampen  Merritt,  Inc.  and  related  companies\n\n(collectively, \"Xerox-VKM\").  Xerox-VKM provided financing to\n\nthe Sterman  entities in  exchange for security  interests in\n\nthe  real estate  and  in bonds  related  to the  development\n\nprojects.\n\n     The  Sterman entities allegedly  defaulted on certain of\n\ntheir obligations relating to at least three projects,  and a\n\nsuccession of  lawsuits began.   The  first suit was  brought\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nagainst the Sterman entities by Xerox-VKM in Illinois federal\n\ndistrict court  on  February  27,  1992,  and  related  to  a\n\nPennsylvania   hotels  development   project.1     A   second\n\ntransaction involved  a hotel  in Colorado; a  Sterman entity\n\nhad agreed to repurchase bonds from Xerox-VKM and Sterman had\n\npersonally guaranteed  the obligation.   When  the repurchase\n\ndid not occur, Xerox-VKM filed two lawsuits.\n\n     The first of those two lawsuits was  brought against the\n\nSterman  entities   in  the   same  Illinois  court   as  the\n\nPennsylvania hotels lawsuit  on March 13,  1992.2  The  other\n\nconcerned  Sterman's   own   guaranty  which   contained   an\n\narbitration  clause; Sterman  was domiciled  in Massachusetts\n\nand, to  compel arbitration,  Xerox-VKM brought  suit against\n\nhim personally in the federal district court in Massachusetts\n\non May 4,  1992.3  In  this action Sterman failed  to respond\n\nto the  complaint  and  the court  entered  a  default  order\n\nagainst him.\n\n     The three  suits just  described are the  centerpiece of\n\nthe  present litigation but are not an exhaustive list of the\n\ndisputes between the parties.   Xerox-VKM brought yet another\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     1Van Kampen  Merritt, Inc. v.

Co. v.  Sterman, No.\r                                                                    \n92-11029-Z (D. Mass.).\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nlawsuit against  the Sterman entities in  New Mexico relating\n\nto a nursing home development  in that state.  In  several of\n\nthe lawsuits,  the Sterman entities filed  counterclaims.  In\n\naddition,  several other transactions between the parties had\n\ngone wrong and  were the subject of  litigation- and workout-\n\nrelated discussions between the parties.\n\n     Against  this  background,  in   May  1992  the  parties\n\nnegotiated  a  global  settlement  agreement to  resolve  all\n\npending  and a  host of  potential lawsuits.   The agreement,\n\nsigned on May  19, 1993, was  a lengthy document  stipulating\n\nthat it would be  governed by Illinois substantive law.   The\n\nparties  agreed  to execute  mutual  releases.   The  Sterman\n\nentities  agreed  to  transfer  their  interests  in  several\n\nproperties to Xerox-VKM; these  were apparently properties in\n\nwhich  Xerox-VKM had  security interests  but for  which they\n\nwanted clear title.   Sterman personally agreed to pay Xerox-\n\nVKM $125,000 in 60 days--July 19, 1993--and to execute a note\n\nfor four more annual installments in the same amount.\n\n     In  return,   Xerox-VKM  agreed  that,  in  addition  to\n\nreleasing the  Sterman entities from various  claims, Sterman\n\nhimself  could  within  60  days  repurchase  from  Xerox-VKM\n\ncertain  bonds  he had  originally  sold them  relating  to a\n\ndevelopment  in Brush,  Colorado  (\"the Brush  bonds\").   The\n\nbonds were priced at nearly $5 million but Sterman apparently\n\ncalculated that he could buy them at the stipulated price and\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nthen resell  them for a  profit of more  than $450,000.   The\n\nbond  repurchase  was proposed  by  Sterman  as  part of  the\n\nsettlement  but  the  terms  were  contained  in  a  separate\n\nagreement.\n\n     The settlement agreement contained a back-up enforcement\n\nmechanism  that is the center of this appeal.  Sterman agreed\n\nto  the entry of a consent judgment against him personally in\n\none  of  the Illinois  actions  (concerning  the Pennsylvania\n\nhotels)  and  in  the  Massachusetts  action (concerning  the\n\nColorado hotel);  but the settlement  agreement provided that\n\nXerox-VKM  would  not  enforce  either judgment  so  long  as\n\nSterman complied  with his  obligations under the  settlement\n\nagreement.  Motions for entry of the consent judgments  noted\n\nthis condition.\n\n     Pursuant to the  settlement agreement, the parties  made\n\nthe property transfers from the Sterman entities to Xerox-VKM\n\non  May  19,  1993,  coincident  with  the   signing  of  the\n\nagreement.   On  June 7,  1993, the consent  judgment against\n\nSterman  and in favor of Xerox-VKM was entered in the pending\n\nMassachusetts case in  the amount of about $2.3  million; and\n\non June 9, 1993, a similar judgment was entered in the amount\n\nof  about $3.5 million in  the original Illinois  action.  On\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nJuly 15, 1993, Xerox-VKM  registered the Illinois judgment in\n\nMassachusetts.  28 U.S.C.   1963.4\n\n     All that remained was for  Sterman to purchase the Brush\n\nbonds by the  July 19 closing  date and to make  the $125,000\n\npayment  on that  date, leaving  Xerox-VKM with  the note  to\n\ncover four more installments.  Sterman was unable to purchase\n\nthe bonds  or  pay the  first  installment on  July  19.   It\n\nappears that he had more  difficulty arranging in advance  to\n\nresell the bonds than he had expected and that he had planned\n\nto  use the  profits on the  resale of  the bonds  to pay the\n\nfirst installment.  Xerox-VKM refused Sterman's request for a\n\ndelay  of  two months  and began  steps  to collect  on their\n\njudgments in Massachusetts.\n\n     Although  Sterman  resided  in  Beverly,  Massachusetts,\n\napparently there was  a scarcity  of assets held  in his  own\n\nname.   Xerox-VKM  thus initiated  so-called  attachments  on\n\ntrustee process directed at a number of business interests in\n\nMassachusetts.   This  procedure is used  under Massachusetts\n\nstate court rules primarily to attach  interests in the hands\n\nof a  third party that are  owed to or indirectly  owned by a\n\njudgment debtor;  and the procedure is  available to judgment\n\ncreditors in Massachusetts federal courts.  See Fed. R.  Civ.\r                                                           \n\nP. 64; Mass. R. Civ. P. 4.2.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     4Van Kampen  Merritt, Inc. v.  Sterman, No.  93-MC-10542\r                                                       \n(D. Mass.).\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n     Xerox-VKM filed motions  to initiate the attachments  in\n\nboth  the Massachusetts  dockets: the  original Massachusetts\n\nconsent  judgment  and  the  new docket  that  reflected  the\n\nregistration of  the Illinois consent judgment.   Judge Zobel\n\npresided over both cases and eventually consolidated them, so\n\nwe  discuss the  proceedings without  differentiating between\n\nthe  two  dockets.   The  original  motion  to  initiate  the\n\nattachments  ex  parte  was  filed on  August  12,  1993, and\r                                  \n\nallowed almost immediately.  \n\n     On October 20, 1993, Sterman filed a motion captioned as\n\none  \"to dissolve  trustee  process and  for other  equitable\n\nrelief.\"   In  substance,  Sterman claimed  that  he had  not\n\nbreached the  settlement agreement, and that even  if he had,\n\nthe fault  lay with Xerox-VKM.   Alternatively, he  said that\n\nXerox-VKM  had  to  give him  credit  for  the  value of  the\n\nproperties  transferred on May 19,  1993, and that  it was an\n\nimpermissible  penalty for  Xerox-VKM  to collect  almost  $6\n\nmillion in  judgments for Sterman's failure to pay a $125,000\n\ndebt.  After  briefing and argument,  Judge Zobel denied  the\n\nmotion.  Sterman did not seek to appeal.\n\n     Proceedings  continued  to  implement  the  attachments,\n\nincluding  discovery directed against the putative \"trustees\"\n\nwho Xerox-VKM thought owed money to Sterman or held interests\n\nowned by him.  Then on  February 1, 1994, Sterman filed a new\n\nmotion captioned as  one \"to modify  judgment amounts or  for\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nentry of satisfaction of  judgment or for accounting  and for\n\nstay.\"    This motion  repeated  in  detail  the penalty  and\n\ncredit-for-previously-transferred-property claims made in the\n\nNovember  motion; in a footnote the new motion also sought to\n\nincorporate the  old one  by reference.   After  briefing and\n\nargument, Judge Zobel denied the motion on February 25, 1994.\n\n     In a memorandum and order Judge Zobel  said that Sterman\n\nhad breached  the settlement agreement by failing to make the\n\npromised  $125,000  payment   and  Xerox-VKM  was   therefore\n\nentitled  to enforce  the  judgments.   Further, Judge  Zobel\n\nconcluded  that  Sterman \"has  used  a  variety of  means  to\n\nobstruct collection of this debt\"; and for this reason  Judge\n\nZobel  granted Xerox-VKM's  recently filed  \"emergency motion\n\nfor  further injunctive relief\" under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 65(b).\n\nThe  order enjoined Sterman, and  others under his control or\n\nin concert  with him, from concealing  or otherwise disposing\n\nof any interest held by or due to Sterman.\n\n     Sterman filed a  timely notice  of appeal  from the  new\n\norder,  entered February 25, 1994, and it is that appeal that\n\nis now before  us.   Judge Zobel's order  also provided  that\n\ndiscovery should  be completed by the  end of May 1994  and a\n\nfurther conference was scheduled for June 1994.  However, the\n\nbriefs  are silent  as  to what  developments,  if any,  have\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\noccurred  in the district court since the order now sought to\n\nbe appealed.\n\n                       II.  THE ISSUES\n\n     1.  The first question concerns our jurisdiction, and  a\n\nrelated claim  of waiver raised  by Xerox-VKM.   The district\n\ncourt's order was in part an explicit preliminary injunction;\n\nsuch  injunctions can  be appealed  immediately, 28  U.S.C.  \n\n1292(a)(1),  and  Sterman's  appeal  was   filed  within  the\n\nrequisite  period.   But, argues  Xerox-VKM, this  should not\n\ngive Sterman a right  to relitigate issues on appeal  that he\n\nraised by motion in October 1993, lost in the district court,\n\nand  chose  then not  to  appeal.   According  to  Xerox-VKM,\n\nSterman has  \"waived\" his  right  to review  of the  district\n\ncourt's rejection of his attacks on the judgments.  These, of\n\ncourse, are the only issues that Sterman wants to litigate on\n\nthis appeal.\n\n     We  regard both  of  Sterman's motions  in the  district\n\ncourt as in substance motions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)  to\n\nset aside final  judgments.   In form  the consent  judgments\n\nwere  both final  judgments; the  principal relief  sought in\n\nSterman's  two  motions  was  effectively to  set  aside  the\n\njudgments; and  the arguments  made in the  motions concerned\n\nthe validity and enforceability  of the judgments rather than\n\nthe technicalities of trustee process.  Apparently both sides\n\nshare this view.\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n     Ordinarily  the  denial  of   a  Rule  60(b)  motion  is\n\nimmediately appealable since  there is nothing left to  do in\n\nthe district court.   See, e.g., FDIC v. Ramirez  Rivera, 869\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d 624,  626 (1st Cir. 1989).   Here neither denial of Rule\n\n60(b) relief ended the proceedings;  they were ongoing at the\n\ntime of both  orders and so  far as  we know continue  today.\n\nThis raises interesting questions  about the appealability of\n\na Rule 60(b)  denial in  the context of  an ongoing  district\n\ncourt proceeding.   See 15B  C. Wright &amp;  A. Miller,  Federal\r                                                                         \n\nPractice  and  Procedure     3916,  at   363  (2d  ed.  1992)\r                                    \n\n(\"[Appeal]  may be denied if  the motion seems  bound up with\n\nother proceedings that remain to be concluded.\").\n\n     In  our  view  it is  sufficient  that  as  part of  its\n\nFebruary  order  the  district court  entered  a  preliminary\n\ninjunction  in aid  of  enforcement of  the  judgments.   The\n\npreliminary  injunction  is  immediately  appealable  and  is\n\nitself colorably dependent on the denial of motions to vacate\n\nthe  judgments. \"Our jurisdiction embraces a consideration of\n\nsuch  questions  as  are  basic  to and  underlie  the  order\n\nsupporting the  appeal.\"     Alloyd  Gen. Corp.  v.  Building\r                                                                         \n\nLeasing  Corp., 361 F.2d 359, 363 (1st Cir. 1966).  Certainly\r                          \n\nthe district  court would not have  continued the enforcement\n\nproceedings if it  had agreed that the  judgments deserved to\n\nbe set aside.\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\n     This  brings us  to  Xerox-VKM's waiver  argument.   The\n\nanalogy it offers is  to one who, having suffered  an adverse\n\njudgment, seeks to set it aside under Rule 60(b); fails; does\n\nnot appeal; and then, when the time for appealing has passed,\n\nrenews the very  same arguments  in a new  motion under  Rule\n\n60(b) and then seeks  to appeal the new denial.   In Burnside\r                                                                         \n\nv.  Eastern Airlines, 519 F.2d 1127 (5th Cir. 1975), cited to\r                                \n\nus by Xerox-VKM, the  court held that the moving  party could\n\nnot effectively pursue an out of time appeal by the expedient\n\nof renewing the same motion later on.\n\n     The  difficulty with  the analogy  is  that even  if the\n\nOctober and February motions are  treated as raising the same\n\narguments,  although with  different  emphases, it  is by  no\n\nmeans clear  that Sterman could  have appealed the  denial of\n\nthe October  motion.  At that  time, there was no  grant of a\n\npreliminary  injunction  as  the  vehicle  for  an  immediate\n\nappeal.   Xerox-VKM gives us  no reason or  precedent to show\n\nthat  such an  appeal was  possible.   If  an appeal  was not\n\npossible, the waiver argument is pretty lame.\n\n     In these  somewhat unusual circumstances, we  think that\n\nthe proper course  is to  reject the waiver  argument and  to\n\ntreat Sterman's claims as sufficiently related to the clearly\n\nappealable injunction to justify our consideration of them on\n\nthe  merits.   Since we  think that  the  claims fail  on the\n\nmerits, it is enough  to assume arguendo that the  waiver and\r                                                    \n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nrelatedness  points are  resolved in  Sterman's favor.

We  turn  now  to  the  main  arguments  raised  in\n\nSterman's  February motion  under  Rule 60(b).   The  consent\n\njudgments  are  on  their  face unqualified  final  judgments\n\nagainst Sterman, totally almost $6 million.  Still, under the\n\nsettlement agreement  the enforcement of  the final judgments\n\nwas  made contingent  on Sterman's  breach of  the agreement.\n\nHad  Sterman complied  with the  agreement, Sterman  would be\n\nentitled to some form of protection--we need not decide  what\n\nkind.  But despite Sterman's original claim to have complied,\n\nit is undisputed that he did not pay the $125,000 promised by\n\nJuly 19 as provided in the written agreement.\n\n     Sterman  might still  obtain  relief by  an  affirmative\n\nshowing of grounds sufficient to persuade a district court to\n\nexercise  its  authority under  Rule 60(b)  to set  aside the\n\njudgments.5    Rule 60(b)  needs  to  be emphasized  because,\n\nwhile Rule 60(b) relief is not wholly a matter of discretion,\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     5How  far the Massachusetts district court had authority\nto  set aside the Illinois judgment is a debatable point, see\r                                                                         \nCarteret Sav. &amp;  Loan Ass'n v.

Rostoff, 39 F.3d 27, 37 n.8 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                      \n\n     Against  this background,  we  consider first  Sterman's\n\nargument that  the judgments  represent a  contract \"penalty\"\n\nforbidden  by   Illinois  law,   in  view  of   the  supposed\n\ndisproportion  between the $125,000  immediately owed and the\n\nalmost $6 million sought to be collected under the judgments.\n\nThe  parties appear to  treat Illinois law  as controlling on\n\nthis  point  because of  the  stipulation  in the  settlement\n\nagreement.  They are arguably mistaken (for reasons explained\n\nbelow)  but state law is pertinent by analogy and Illinois is\n\na perfectly good example.\n\n     Illinois does refuse to enforce penalties  in contracts,\n\nsee, e.g.,  Lake  River Corp.  v. Carborundum  Co., 769  F.2d\r                                                              \n\n1284, 1288-91  (7th Cir. 1985);  Bauer v.

Indeed, even a  contract agreeing to\n\nsettle a pending or  threatened suit--technically, a contract\n\nof  \"accord\"  --may be  enforceable  despite  claims that  it\n\nconstitutes  a  penalty.   Williston  says  that the  penalty\n\ndefense is not available  in such cases; and the  sparse case\n\nlaw is divided, weighted slightly in favor of Williston.  See\r                                                                         \n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\ngenerally 5 Williston,  Contracts    780, at  700-01 (3d  ed.\r                                             \n\n1961).6\n\n     The rationale  for the rule  against enforcing penalties\n\nin  contract cases is not crystal clear.   But it is not hard\n\nto imagine why a court might  be loath to enforce a  contract\n\nprovision  specifying  a disproportionately  large sum--which\n\ncourts  call  a penalty--for  breach  of the  contract.   The\n\nparties  may make  such an  agreement far  in advance  of the\n\ndispute  and may  not  appreciate  the  full  impact  if  the\n\nunlikely  breach  does  occur.    Contract  damages,  broadly\n\nspeaking, aim  at compensation, not at  punishment.  Finally,\n\ncourts  do not  like results  that appear  unjust.   See Lake\r                                                                         \n\nRiver, 769 F.2d at 1288-91.\r                 \n\n     The  force of  such concerns  is lessened  where one  is\n\ndealing  with a contract of accord that is entered into after\r                                                                         \n\nthe  dispute  has arisen.   At  this  point, the  parties are\n\nfocusing  on the strength  of the claims,  the likely damages\n\nand  the costs of litigating.

These attitudes seem to underlie\n\nthe Williston  view that the defendant  should be constrained\n\nin attacking his own settlement.  \n\n     Courts  that share  this  view may  also  feel that  the\n\nplaintiff,  who  in settlement  often  accepts  less than  is\n\nclaimed,  ought not then be forced to litigate anew about the\n\npropriety  of   the  discounted  amount.     After  all,  the\n\nsettlement  may be  attractive just  because it  assures that\n\nlitigation about liability and amounts is over.  If this view\n\nis taken of  a contract in accord, one would  expect the same\n\nconsiderations to  apply several times over  to insulate from\n\npenalty defenses  a court-entered consent judgment,  which is\n\none step further down the line (and a very important step).\n\n     The present case is  somewhat different from an ordinary\n\nconsent  judgment since Sterman's consent judgments, although\n\nfinal in form, were contingent as to enforcement on a default\n\nby  Sterman.   In that  sense  the analogy  to a  contract in\n\naccord may  be a good one.   We have found  no Illinois state\n\ndecisions on whether the penalty defense applies to contracts\n\nof accord.7   To the extent  we were forced to  guess at what\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     7Two  federal  decisions  cited  to  us  assume  without\ndiscussion that Illinois would  apply its penalty analysis to\na settlement agreement.

While state law\n\non  contracts  is  very  instructive--that  is  why  we  have\n\ndiscussed  it--\"[t]he grounds and  the procedure  for setting\n\naside a federal  judgment are  entirely a  matter of  federal\n\nlaw, on  which state law  may be  disregarded.\"  11  Wright &amp;\n\nMiller, supra,    2353, at 147-48; see  also Johnson Chemical\r                                                                         \n\nCo.  v.

Even  if Illinois did regard a contract  in accord as\n\nsubject to  a penalty defense,  it is  debatable whether  the\n\ndistrict  court  would have  been  forced  to  use  the  same\n\nstandard in deciding whether to reopen.\n\n     In all events, there  is no showing that enforcement  of\n\nthe judgments involves a penalty.  This case does not involve\n\nin  isolation the collection of $6 million for failure to pay\n\na  $125,000 debt.    Any judgment  about disproportion  would\n\ndepend  on  the reasonable  magnitude  of all  of  the claims\n\nsettled  by the  May 19  settlement and  all of  the benefits\n\n                    \r                                \n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n\nreceived by Xerox-VKM.  The settlement covered four lawsuits,\n\nthree  projects,  and  a  substantial number  of  claims  and\n\ncounterclaims.  Xerox-VKM  may well receive less  than it was\n\noriginally  entitled to even if it collects the $6 million in\n\njudgments and keeps  or collects everything else  that it was\r                         \n\ngiven or promised under the settlement.\n\n     Even  if  the penalty  defense  were  available, it  was\n\nSterman's  burden  to make  a  colorable  showing of  overall\n\ndisproportion  through affidavits  before the  district court\n\nneeded even consider taking the claim  seriously.  His jumble\n\nof assertions  and conclusions  does not even  begin to  make\n\nsuch  a  showing.   Xerox-VKM  appears  to assert  that  even\n\ncollection  of the full judgment will not make them whole but\n\nthis is  beside the point.   What  they bargained for  in the\n\nsettlement included the right not to have to prove the actual\r                                             \n\namount of  their  claims.   Instead,  Sterman  now  has  them\n\narguing about the matter.\n\n     This discussion also disposes of Sterman's related claim\n\nthat he ought to  receive \"credit\" against the  judgments for\n\nthe value of assets transferred on May 19.   At first glance,\n\nthis might seem  to be a straightforward  suggestion that the\n\ndefendant suffered a  judgment, paid part  of it, and  should\n\nnaturally  be held to owe only  the unpaid balance.  When one\n\nunderstands  what Sterman  is actually  saying, his  claim is\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n\nseen to  depend on the  same kind of false  comparison as his\n\npenalty argument.\n\n     Nothing in  the settlement agreement  suggests that  the\n\namounts specified in the consent judgments are to be  reduced\n\nby  the assets transferred on  the same day  as the agreement\n\nwas  signed and well before the  judgments were even entered.\n\nSo  far as  we  know, the  transfers  may themselves  may  be\n\nnothing  more than the  clearing of  title to  assets already\n\nheld  by Xerox-VKM as security.   And while  such security if\n\nrealized  would probably  reduce  liability, Sterman  has (as\n\nnoted) provided us with nothing to suggest that Xerox-VKM has\n\nor ever will  collect as much as they might  have done if the\n\nSterman entities had compliedwith their original commitments.\n\n     3.   This disposes of  the arguments made  by Sterman in\n\nhis February motion, but he also seeks to brief in this court\n\nadditional    arguments   made   in   his   October   motion.\n\nPertinently, he claims that parol agreements, both before and\n\nafter  the May  19 agreement,  made Sterman's payment  of the\n\n$125,000 contingent on his ability to  resell the Brush bonds\n\nand  provided that the July 19 closing date would be extended\n\nupon Sterman's  request.  For  reasons already set  forth, we\n\nthink that these claims have arguably been preserved.\n\n     At the oral argument on  the October motion, Judge Zobel\n\nbrushed aside the Sterman's claim that Xerox-VKM had from the\n\noutset orally agreed to such a  linkage or a right of Sterman\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\nto  extend at will.  Her  ruling was understandable:  the May\n\n19 agreement was a complex, lawyer-crafted,  written document\n\nand it made  no mention of any such linkage  or right; on the\n\ncontrary, it said that  time was of the essence,  adding only\n\nthat the parties could agree to extend the closing date.  \r                                        \n\n     Under  parol evidence  rules,  followed  in Illinois  as\n\nelsewhere, evidence  of an alleged \"prior  or contemporaneous\n\nagreement[]\" is  inadmissible if  \"it would have  been normal\n\nfor  the parties  to incorporate  [such an agreement]  in the\n\nwritten  instrument   . . .  .\"   Roth v.  Meeker, 389 N.E.2d\r                                                             \n\n1248, 1256  (Ill. App. Ct.. 1979).   In this case,  the parol\n\nevidence rule applies with  full force.  Once again,  it does\n\nnot matter  whether Illinois  law governs the  decision under\n\nRule  60(b) whether  to reopen  the judgments,  for it  is at\n\nleast instructive by analogy.\n\n     But the parol evidence rule generally governs only prior\n\nor contemporaneous agreements.  Thus:\n\n     [I]t   does   not   bar  evidence   of   subsequent\n     negotiations to show modification of  the contract.\n     Even   a   completely   integrated  agreement   can\n     therefore be modified or rescinded orally, subject,\n     of course, to the doctrine of consideration and the\n     statute of  frauds.

Still, \"[t]he court need not hold a hearing on\n\na  motion for relief from  judgment if the  motion is clearly\n\nwithout  substance .  . . .\"   11  Wright &amp;  Miller, supra,  \r                                                                      \n\n2865, at 227.  We think that there is more than enough in the\n\nrecord to  make clear that  Sterman's claim is  without merit\n\nand that no evidentiary hearing was  needed to establish this\n\npoint (it was the subject of oral argument).  \n\n     A close  reading of  Sterman's affidavits--one from  him\n\nand another  from his broker--show that  neither provides any\n\nbasis for  believing that  the parties reached  an agreement,\n\nafter the original May 19 document was signed,  purporting to\r                 \n\nextend the  closing  date  or to  condition  the  closing  on\n\nSterman's resale of the Brush bonds.  Further, between May 19\n\nand  the scheduled  closing  date, Xerox-VKM  twice wrote  to\n\nSterman  to  reconfirm  his  remaining  obligations;  neither\n\nletter  evidenced  any  flexibility   on  the  date  and  one\n\nexplicitly reminded Sterman that he would be in default if he\n\nfailed to fulfill his obligations by July 19.\n\n     Finally,  on July 19 Sterman himself faxed a letter to a\n\nXerox-VKM  representative  requesting  an  extension  of  the\n\nclosing date.  He made no  claim that Xerox-VKM had agreed to\n\n                             -20-\r                                         -20-\r\r\n\nextend the closing date  or that he had any  unilateral right\n\nto an extension.   Far from granting an  extension, Xerox-VKM\n\nwrote  to  Sterman the  next day  informing  him that  he had\n\ndefaulted on  his  payment  obligation,  that  the  judgments\n\nagainst him could  now be executed, and  that his opportunity\n\nto  purchase the  Brush bonds  had now  expired.   Three days\n\nlater  Sterman  again  sought  an  extension,  and  Xerox-VKM\n\nimmediately refused.\n\n     In sum,  despite references in  his brief to  a supposed\n\npost-May 19  modification in the  settlement agreement, there\n\nis  no  substantial  basis  for  such  a  claim,  and  it  is\n\ncontradicted by  Sterman's own  correspondence.  Under  these\n\ncircumstances, we think that  there is no reason to  take the\n\nclaim seriously.\n\n     Xerox-VKM's motion to supplement the record by inclusion\n\nof  a  previously omitted  exhibit  page  is  granted.

The settlement went awry;  and one side sought to enforce consent judgments filed as part of the settlement.  The subject of those judgments sought to undo them and now appeals from the district court's denial of his efforts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. THE HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant Marshall S. Sterman (\"Sterman\") and his now-deceased partner Lester Grant owned or controlled a number of business entities (\"the Sterman entities\") that engaged in real estate development projects in a number of states in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  To finance these projects, the Sterman entities entered into transactions with appellee Xerox Financial Services Life Insurance Company and appellee Van Kampen Merritt, Inc. and related companies (collectively, \"Xerox-VKM\").  Xerox-VKM provided financing to the Sterman entities in exchange for security interests in the real estate and in bonds related to the development projects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sterman entities allegedly defaulted on certain of their obligations relating to at least three projects, and a succession of lawsuits began.  The first suit was brought against the Sterman entities by Xerox-VKM in Illinois federal district court on February 27, 1992, and related to a Pennsylvania hotels development project.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  A second transaction involved a hotel in Colorado;  a Sterman entity had agreed to repurchase bonds from Xerox-VKM and Sterman had personally guaranteed the obligation.  When the repurchase did not occur, Xerox-VKM filed two lawsuits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first of those two lawsuits was brought against the Sterman entities in the same Illinois court as the Pennsylvania hotels lawsuit on March 13, 1992.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The other concerned Sterman's own guaranty which contained an arbitration clause;  Sterman was domiciled in Massachusetts and, to compel arbitration, Xerox-VKM brought suit against him personally in the federal district court in Massachusetts on May 4, 1992.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In this action Sterman failed to respond to the complaint and the court entered a default order against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three suits just described are the centerpiece of the present litigation but are not an exhaustive list of the disputes between the parties.  Xerox-VKM brought yet another lawsuit against the Sterman entities in New Mexico relating to a nursing home development in that state.  In several of the lawsuits, the Sterman entities filed counterclaims.  In addition, several other transactions between the parties had gone wrong and were the subject of litigation- and workout-related discussions between the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, in May 1992 the parties negotiated a global settlement agreement to resolve all pending and a host of potential lawsuits.  The agreement, signed on May 19, 1993, was a lengthy document stipulating that it would be governed by Illinois substantive law.  The parties agreed to execute mutual releases.  The Sterman entities agreed to transfer their interests in several properties to Xerox-VKM;  these were apparently properties in which Xerox-VKM had security interests but for which they wanted clear title.  Sterman personally agreed to pay Xerox-VKM $125,000 in 60 days--July 19, 1993--and to execute a note for four more annual installments in the same amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In return, Xerox-VKM agreed that, in addition to releasing the Sterman entities from various claims, Sterman himself could within 60 days repurchase from Xerox-VKM certain bonds he had originally sold them relating to a development in Brush, Colorado (\"the Brush bonds\").  The bonds were priced at nearly $5 million but Sterman apparently calculated that he could buy them at the stipulated price and then resell them for a profit of more than $450,000.  The bond repurchase was proposed by Sterman as part of the settlement but the terms were contained in a separate agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The settlement agreement contained a back-up enforcement mechanism that is the center of this appeal.  Sterman agreed to the entry of a consent judgment against him personally in one of the Illinois actions (concerning the Pennsylvania hotels) and in the Massachusetts action (concerning the Colorado hotel);  but the settlement agreement provided that Xerox-VKM would not enforce either judgment so long as Sterman complied with his obligations under the settlement agreement.  Motions for entry of the consent judgments noted this condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the parties made the property transfers from the Sterman entities to Xerox-VKM on May 19, 1993, coincident with the signing of the agreement.  On June 7, 1993, the consent judgment against Sterman and in favor of Xerox-VKM was entered in the pending Massachusetts case in the amount of about $2.3 million;  and on June 9, 1993, a similar judgment was entered in the amount of about $3.5 million in the original Illinois action.  On July 15, 1993, Xerox-VKM registered the Illinois judgment in Massachusetts.  28 U.S.C. Sec. 1963.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All that remained was for Sterman to purchase the Brush bonds by the July 19 closing date and to make the $125,000 payment on that date, leaving Xerox-VKM with the note to cover four more installments.  Sterman was unable to purchase the bonds or pay the first installment on July 19.  It appears that he had more difficulty arranging in advance to resell the bonds than he had expected and that he had planned to use the profits on the resale of the bonds to pay the first installment.  Xerox-VKM refused Sterman's request for a delay of two months and began steps to collect on their judgments in Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Sterman resided in Beverly, Massachusetts, apparently there was a scarcity of assets held in his own name.  Xerox-VKM thus initiated so-called attachments on trustee process directed at a number of business interests in Massachusetts.  This procedure is used under Massachusetts state court rules primarily to attach interests in the hands of a third party that are owed to or indirectly owned by a judgment debtor;  and the procedure is available to judgment creditors in Massachusetts federal courts.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 64;  Mass.R.Civ.P. 4.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Xerox-VKM filed motions to initiate the attachments in both the Massachusetts dockets:  the original Massachusetts consent judgment and the new docket that reflected the registration of the Illinois consent judgment.  Judge Zobel presided over both cases and eventually consolidated them, so we discuss the proceedings without differentiating between the two dockets.  The original motion to initiate the attachments ex parte was filed on August 12, 1993, and allowed almost immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 20, 1993, Sterman filed a motion captioned as one \"to dissolve trustee process and for other equitable relief.\"   In substance, Sterman claimed that he had not breached the settlement agreement, and that even if he had, the fault lay with Xerox-VKM.  Alternatively, he said that Xerox-VKM had to give him credit for the value of the properties transferred on May 19, 1993, and that it was an impermissible penalty for Xerox-VKM to collect almost $6 million in judgments for Sterman's failure to pay a $125,000 debt.  After briefing and argument, Judge Zobel denied the motion.  Sterman did not seek to appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proceedings continued to implement the attachments, including discovery directed against the putative \"trustees\" who Xerox-VKM thought owed money to Sterman or held interests owned by him.  Then on February 1, 1994, Sterman filed a new motion captioned as one \"to modify judgment amounts or for entry of satisfaction of judgment or for accounting and for stay.\"   This motion repeated in detail the penalty and credit-for-previously-transferred-property claims made in the November motion;  in a footnote the new motion also sought to incorporate the old one by reference.  After briefing and argument, Judge Zobel denied the motion on February 25, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a memorandum and order Judge Zobel said that Sterman had breached the settlement agreement by failing to make the promised $125,000 payment and Xerox-VKM was therefore entitled to enforce the judgments.  Further, Judge Zobel concluded that Sterman \"has used a variety of means to obstruct collection of this debt\";  and for this reason Judge Zobel granted Xerox-VKM's recently filed \"emergency motion for further injunctive relief\" under Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(b).  The order enjoined Sterman, and others under his control or in concert with him, from concealing or otherwise disposing of any interest held by or due to Sterman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sterman filed a timely notice of appeal from the new order, entered February 25, 1994, and it is that appeal that is now before us.  Judge Zobel's order also provided that discovery should be completed by the end of May 1994 and a further conference was scheduled for June 1994.  However, the briefs are silent as to what developments, if any, have occurred in the district court since the order now sought to be appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE ISSUES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  The first question concerns our jurisdiction, and a related claim of waiver raised by Xerox-VKM.  The district court's order was in part an explicit preliminary injunction;  such injunctions can be appealed immediately, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a)(1), and Sterman's appeal was filed within the requisite period.  But, argues Xerox-VKM, this should not give Sterman a right to relitigate issues on appeal that he raised by motion in October 1993, lost in the district court, and chose then not to appeal.  According to Xerox-VKM, Sterman has \"waived\" his right to review of the district court's rejection of his attacks on the judgments.  These, of course, are the only issues that Sterman wants to litigate on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We regard both of Sterman's motions in the district court as in substance motions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) to set aside final judgments.  In form the consent judgments were both final judgments;  the principal relief sought in Sterman's two motions was effectively to set aside the judgments;  and the arguments made in the motions concerned the validity and enforceability of the judgments rather than the technicalities of trustee process.  Apparently both sides share this view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is immediately appealable since there is nothing left to do in the district court.  See, e.g., FDIC v. Ramirez Rivera, 869 F.2d 624, 626 (1st Cir.1989).  Here neither denial of Rule 60(b) relief ended the proceedings;  they were ongoing at the time of both orders and so far as we know continue today.  This raises interesting questions about the appealability of a Rule 60(b) denial in the context of an ongoing district court proceeding.  See 15B C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 3916, at 363 (2d ed. 1992) (\"[Appeal] may be denied if the motion seems bound up with other proceedings that remain to be concluded.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view it is sufficient that as part of its February order the district court entered a preliminary injunction in aid of enforcement of the judgments.  The preliminary injunction is immediately appealable and is itself colorably dependent on the denial of motions to vacate the judgments.  \"Our jurisdiction embraces a consideration of such questions as are basic to and underlie the order supporting the appeal.\"  Alloyd Gen. Corp. v. Building Leasing Corp., 361 F.2d 359, 363 (1st Cir.1966).  Certainly the district court would not have continued the enforcement proceedings if it had agreed that the judgments deserved to be set aside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Xerox-VKM's waiver argument.  The analogy it offers is to one who, having suffered an adverse judgment, seeks to set it aside under Rule 60(b);  fails;  does not appeal;  and then, when the time for appealing has passed, renews the very same arguments in a new motion under Rule 60(b) and then seeks to appeal the new denial.  In Burnside v. Eastern Airlines, 519 F.2d 1127 (5th Cir.1975), cited to us by Xerox-VKM, the court held that the moving party could not effectively pursue an out of time appeal by the expedient of renewing the same motion later on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty with the analogy is that even if the October and February motions are treated as raising the same arguments, although with different emphases, it is by no means clear that Sterman could have appealed the denial of the October motion.  At that time, there was no grant of a preliminary injunction as the vehicle for an immediate appeal.  Xerox-VKM gives us no reason or precedent to show that such an appeal was possible.  If an appeal was not possible, the waiver argument is pretty lame.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these somewhat unusual circumstances, we think that the proper course is to reject the waiver argument and to treat Sterman's claims as sufficiently related to the clearly appealable injunction to justify our consideration of them on the merits.  Since we think that the claims fail on the merits, it is enough to assume arguendo that the waiver and relatedness points are resolved in Sterman's favor.  See, e.g., Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Nat'l Bank v. Howard Communications Corp., 980 F.2d 823, 829 (1st Cir.1992) (avoiding difficult jurisdictional issue to resolve merits of interlocutory appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. We turn now to the main arguments raised in Sterman's February motion under Rule 60(b).  The consent judgments are on their face unqualified final judgments against Sterman, totally almost $6 million.  Still, under the settlement agreement the enforcement of the final judgments was made contingent on Sterman's breach of the agreement.  Had Sterman complied with the agreement, Sterman would be entitled to some form of protection--we need not decide what kind.  But despite Sterman's original claim to have complied, it is undisputed that he did not pay the $125,000 promised by July 19 as provided in the written agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sterman might still obtain relief by an affirmative showing of grounds sufficient to persuade a district court to exercise its authority under Rule 60(b) to set aside the judgments.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Rule 60(b) needs to be emphasized because, while Rule 60(b) relief is not wholly a matter of discretion, relief from a final judgment is \"extraordinary\";  discretion plays a role;  and neither the grounds nor the procedures are as rigidly prescribed as those that would attend an ordinary lawsuit seeking a judgment in the first instance.  Vasapolli v. Rostoff, 39 F.3d 27, 37 n. 8 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, we consider first Sterman's argument that the judgments represent a contract \"penalty\" forbidden by Illinois law, in view of the supposed disproportion between the $125,000 immediately owed and the almost $6 million sought to be collected under the judgments.  The parties appear to treat Illinois law as controlling on this point because of the stipulation in the settlement agreement.  They are arguably mistaken (for reasons explained below) but state law is pertinent by analogy and Illinois is a perfectly good example.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Illinois does refuse to enforce penalties in contracts, see, e.g., Lake River Corp. v. Carborundum Co., 769 F.2d 1284, 1288-91 (7th Cir.1985);  Bauer v. Sawyer, 8 Ill.2d 351, 134 N.E.2d 329, 333-34 (1956), but the rule may have little to do with final judgments.  Indeed, even a contract agreeing to settle a pending or threatened suit--technically, a contract of \"accord\"--may be enforceable despite claims that it constitutes a penalty.  Williston says that the penalty defense is not available in such cases;  and the sparse case law is divided, weighted slightly in favor of Williston.  See generally 5 Williston, Contracts Sec. 780, at 700-01 (3d ed. 1961).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rationale for the rule against enforcing penalties in contract cases is not crystal clear.  But it is not hard to imagine why a court might be loath to enforce a contract provision specifying a disproportionately large sum--which courts call a penalty--for breach of the contract.  The parties may make such an agreement far in advance of the dispute and may not appreciate the full impact if the unlikely breach does occur.  Contract damages, broadly speaking, aim at compensation, not at punishment.  Finally, courts do not like results that appear unjust.  See Lake River, 769 F.2d at 1288-91.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The force of such concerns is lessened where one is dealing with a contract of accord that is entered into after the dispute has arisen.  At this point, the parties are focusing on the strength of the claims, the likely damages and the costs of litigating.  If the defendant, or potential defendant, now consents to judgment in a specific amount, it is ordinarily done with eyes wide open, and in large matters usually with legal advice.  These attitudes seem to underlie the Williston view that the defendant should be constrained in attacking his own settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts that share this view may also feel that the plaintiff, who in settlement often accepts less than is claimed, ought not then be forced to litigate anew about the propriety of the discounted amount.  After all, the settlement may be attractive just because it assures that litigation about liability and amounts is over.  If this view is taken of a contract in accord, one would expect the same considerations to apply several times over to insulate from penalty defenses a court-entered consent judgment, which is one step further down the line (and a very important step).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present case is somewhat different from an ordinary consent judgment since Sterman's consent judgments, although final in form, were contingent as to enforcement on a default by Sterman.  In that sense the analogy to a contract in accord may be a good one.  We have found no Illinois state decisions on whether the penalty defense applies to contracts of accord.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  To the extent we were forced to guess at what Illinois law might be, we would incline toward following the Williston view that something far more than a showing of \"penalty\" is needed to defeat an obligation expressly assumed to settle a pending or threatened law suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is more, we are not concerned here directly with a contract suit governed by Illinois law but with a motion to reopen a federal judgment under Rule 60(b).  While state law on contracts is very instructive--that is why we have discussed it--\"[t]he grounds and the procedure for setting aside a federal judgment are entirely a matter of federal law, on which state law may be disregarded.\"   11 Wright &amp; Miller, supra, Sec. 2353, at 147-48;  see also Johnson Chemical Co. v. Condado Center, Inc., 453 F.2d 1044, 1046 (1st Cir.1972).  Even if Illinois did regard a contract in accord as subject to a penalty defense, it is debatable whether the district court would have been forced to use the same standard in deciding whether to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, there is no showing that enforcement of the judgments involves a penalty.  This case does not involve in isolation the collection of $6 million for failure to pay a $125,000 debt.  Any judgment about disproportion would depend on the reasonable magnitude of all of the claims settled by the May 19 settlement and all of the benefits received by Xerox-VKM.  The settlement covered four lawsuits, three projects, and a substantial number of claims and counterclaims.  Xerox-VKM may well receive less than it was originally entitled to even if it collects the $6 million in judgments and keeps or collects everything else that it was given or promised under the settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the penalty defense were available, it was Sterman's burden to make a colorable showing of overall disproportion through affidavits before the district court needed even consider taking the claim seriously.  His jumble of assertions and conclusions does not even begin to make such a showing.  Xerox-VKM appears to assert that even collection of the full judgment will not make them whole but this is beside the point.  What they bargained for in the settlement included the right not to have to prove the actual amount of their claims.  Instead, Sterman now has them arguing about the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This discussion also disposes of Sterman's related claim that he ought to receive \"credit\" against the judgments for the value of assets transferred on May 19.  At first glance, this might seem to be a straightforward suggestion that the defendant suffered a judgment, paid part of it, and should naturally be held to owe only the unpaid balance.  When one understands what Sterman is actually saying, his claim is seen to depend on the same kind of false comparison as his penalty argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the settlement agreement suggests that the amounts specified in the consent judgments are to be reduced by the assets transferred on the same day as the agreement was signed and well before the judgments were even entered.  So far as we know, the transfers themselves may be nothing more than the clearing of title to assets already held by Xerox-VKM as security.  And while such security if realized would probably reduce liability, Sterman has (as noted) provided us with nothing to suggest that Xerox-VKM has or ever will collect as much as they might have done if the Sterman entities had complied with their original commitments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.  This disposes of the arguments made by Sterman in his February motion, but he also seeks to brief in this court additional arguments made in his October motion.  Pertinently, he claims that parol agreements, both before and after the May 19 agreement, made Sterman's payment of the $125,000 contingent on his ability to resell the Brush bonds and provided that the July 19 closing date would be extended upon Sterman's request.  For reasons already set forth, we think that these claims have arguably been preserved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the oral argument on the October motion, Judge Zobel brushed aside the Sterman's claim that Xerox-VKM had from the outset orally agreed to such a linkage or a right of Sterman to extend at will.  Her ruling was understandable:  the May 19 agreement was a complex, lawyer-crafted, written document and it made no mention of any such linkage or right;  on the contrary, it said that time was of the essence, adding only that the parties could agree to extend the closing date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under parol evidence rules, followed in Illinois as elsewhere, evidence of an alleged \"prior or contemporaneous agreement[ ]\" is inadmissible if \"it would have been normal for the parties to incorporate [such an agreement] in the written instrument....\"  Roth v. Meeker, 72 Ill.App.3d 66, 27 Ill.Dec. 840, 848, 389 N.E.2d 1248, 1256 (1979).  In this case, the parol evidence rule applies with full force.  Once again, it does not matter whether Illinois law governs the decision under Rule 60(b) whether to reopen the judgments, for it is at least instructive by analogy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the parol evidence rule generally governs only prior or contemporaneous agreements.  Thus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>[I]t does not bar evidence of subsequent negotiations to show modification of the contract.  Even a completely integrated agreement can therefore be modified or rescinded orally, subject, of course, to the doctrine of consideration and the statute of frauds.  In a few states, legislation requires a writing for the modification or rescission of a written instrument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

Still, \"[t]he court need not hold a hearing on a motion for relief from judgment if the motion is clearly without substance....\"  11 Wright &amp; Miller, supra, Sec. 2865, at 227.  We think that there is more than enough in the record to make clear that Sterman's claim is without merit and that no evidentiary hearing was needed to establish this point (it was the subject of oral argument).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A close reading of Sterman's affidavits--one from him and another from his broker--show that neither provides any basis for believing that the parties reached an agreement, after the original May 19 document was signed, purporting to extend the closing date or to condition the closing on Sterman's resale of the Brush bonds.  Further, between May 19 and the scheduled closing date, Xerox-VKM twice wrote to Sterman to reconfirm his remaining obligations;  neither letter evidenced any flexibility on the date and one explicitly reminded Sterman that he would be in default if he failed to fulfill his obligations by July 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, on July 19 Sterman himself faxed a letter to a Xerox-VKM representative requesting an extension of the closing date.  He made no claim that Xerox-VKM had agreed to extend the closing date or that he had any unilateral right to an extension.  Far from granting an extension, Xerox-VKM wrote to Sterman the next day informing him that he had defaulted on his payment obligation, that the judgments against him could now be executed, and that his opportunity to purchase the Brush bonds had now expired.  Three days later Sterman again sought an extension, and Xerox-VKM immediately refused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, despite references in his brief to a supposed post-May 19 modification in the settlement agreement, there is no substantial basis for such a claim, and it is contradicted by Sterman's own correspondence.  Under these circumstances, we think that there is no reason to take the claim seriously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Xerox-VKM's motion to supplement the record by inclusion of a previously omitted exhibit page is granted.

The settlement went awry;  and one side sought to enforce consent judgments filed as part of the settlement.  The subject of those judgments sought to undo them and now appeals from the district court's denial of his efforts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. THE HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant Marshall S. Sterman (\"Sterman\") and his now-deceased partner Lester Grant owned or controlled a number of business entities (\"the Sterman entities\") that engaged in real estate development projects in a number of states in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  To finance these projects, the Sterman entities entered into transactions with appellee Xerox Financial Services Life Insurance Company and appellee Van Kampen Merritt, Inc. and related companies (collectively, \"Xerox-VKM\").  Xerox-VKM provided financing to the Sterman entities in exchange for security interests in the real estate and in bonds related to the development projects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sterman entities allegedly defaulted on certain of their obligations relating to at least three projects, and a succession of lawsuits began.  The first suit was brought against the Sterman entities by Xerox-VKM in Illinois federal district court on February 27, 1992, and related to a Pennsylvania hotels development project.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  A second transaction involved a hotel in Colorado;  a Sterman entity had agreed to repurchase bonds from Xerox-VKM and Sterman had personally guaranteed the obligation.  When the repurchase did not occur, Xerox-VKM filed two lawsuits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first of those two lawsuits was brought against the Sterman entities in the same Illinois court as the Pennsylvania hotels lawsuit on March 13, 1992.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The other concerned Sterman's own guaranty which contained an arbitration clause;  Sterman was domiciled in Massachusetts and, to compel arbitration, Xerox-VKM brought suit against him personally in the federal district court in Massachusetts on May 4, 1992.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In this action Sterman failed to respond to the complaint and the court entered a default order against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three suits just described are the centerpiece of the present litigation but are not an exhaustive list of the disputes between the parties.  Xerox-VKM brought yet another lawsuit against the Sterman entities in New Mexico relating to a nursing home development in that state.  In several of the lawsuits, the Sterman entities filed counterclaims.  In addition, several other transactions between the parties had gone wrong and were the subject of litigation- and workout-related discussions between the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, in May 1992 the parties negotiated a global settlement agreement to resolve all pending and a host of potential lawsuits.  The agreement, signed on May 19, 1993, was a lengthy document stipulating that it would be governed by Illinois substantive law.  The parties agreed to execute mutual releases.  The Sterman entities agreed to transfer their interests in several properties to Xerox-VKM;  these were apparently properties in which Xerox-VKM had security interests but for which they wanted clear title.  Sterman personally agreed to pay Xerox-VKM $125,000 in 60 days--July 19, 1993--and to execute a note for four more annual installments in the same amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In return, Xerox-VKM agreed that, in addition to releasing the Sterman entities from various claims, Sterman himself could within 60 days repurchase from Xerox-VKM certain bonds he had originally sold them relating to a development in Brush, Colorado (\"the Brush bonds\").  The bonds were priced at nearly $5 million but Sterman apparently calculated that he could buy them at the stipulated price and then resell them for a profit of more than $450,000.  The bond repurchase was proposed by Sterman as part of the settlement but the terms were contained in a separate agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The settlement agreement contained a back-up enforcement mechanism that is the center of this appeal.  Sterman agreed to the entry of a consent judgment against him personally in one of the Illinois actions (concerning the Pennsylvania hotels) and in the Massachusetts action (concerning the Colorado hotel);  but the settlement agreement provided that Xerox-VKM would not enforce either judgment so long as Sterman complied with his obligations under the settlement agreement.  Motions for entry of the consent judgments noted this condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the parties made the property transfers from the Sterman entities to Xerox-VKM on May 19, 1993, coincident with the signing of the agreement.  On June 7, 1993, the consent judgment against Sterman and in favor of Xerox-VKM was entered in the pending Massachusetts case in the amount of about $2.3 million;  and on June 9, 1993, a similar judgment was entered in the amount of about $3.5 million in the original Illinois action.  On July 15, 1993, Xerox-VKM registered the Illinois judgment in Massachusetts.  28 U.S.C. Sec. 1963.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All that remained was for Sterman to purchase the Brush bonds by the July 19 closing date and to make the $125,000 payment on that date, leaving Xerox-VKM with the note to cover four more installments.  Sterman was unable to purchase the bonds or pay the first installment on July 19.  It appears that he had more difficulty arranging in advance to resell the bonds than he had expected and that he had planned to use the profits on the resale of the bonds to pay the first installment.  Xerox-VKM refused Sterman's request for a delay of two months and began steps to collect on their judgments in Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Sterman resided in Beverly, Massachusetts, apparently there was a scarcity of assets held in his own name.  Xerox-VKM thus initiated so-called attachments on trustee process directed at a number of business interests in Massachusetts.  This procedure is used under Massachusetts state court rules primarily to attach interests in the hands of a third party that are owed to or indirectly owned by a judgment debtor;  and the procedure is available to judgment creditors in Massachusetts federal courts.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 64;  Mass.R.Civ.P. 4.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Xerox-VKM filed motions to initiate the attachments in both the Massachusetts dockets:  the original Massachusetts consent judgment and the new docket that reflected the registration of the Illinois consent judgment.  Judge Zobel presided over both cases and eventually consolidated them, so we discuss the proceedings without differentiating between the two dockets.  The original motion to initiate the attachments ex parte was filed on August 12, 1993, and allowed almost immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 20, 1993, Sterman filed a motion captioned as one \"to dissolve trustee process and for other equitable relief.\"   In substance, Sterman claimed that he had not breached the settlement agreement, and that even if he had, the fault lay with Xerox-VKM.  Alternatively, he said that Xerox-VKM had to give him credit for the value of the properties transferred on May 19, 1993, and that it was an impermissible penalty for Xerox-VKM to collect almost $6 million in judgments for Sterman's failure to pay a $125,000 debt.  After briefing and argument, Judge Zobel denied the motion.  Sterman did not seek to appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proceedings continued to implement the attachments, including discovery directed against the putative \"trustees\" who Xerox-VKM thought owed money to Sterman or held interests owned by him.  Then on February 1, 1994, Sterman filed a new motion captioned as one \"to modify judgment amounts or for entry of satisfaction of judgment or for accounting and for stay.\"   This motion repeated in detail the penalty and credit-for-previously-transferred-property claims made in the November motion;  in a footnote the new motion also sought to incorporate the old one by reference.  After briefing and argument, Judge Zobel denied the motion on February 25, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a memorandum and order Judge Zobel said that Sterman had breached the settlement agreement by failing to make the promised $125,000 payment and Xerox-VKM was therefore entitled to enforce the judgments.  Further, Judge Zobel concluded that Sterman \"has used a variety of means to obstruct collection of this debt\";  and for this reason Judge Zobel granted Xerox-VKM's recently filed \"emergency motion for further injunctive relief\" under Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(b).  The order enjoined Sterman, and others under his control or in concert with him, from concealing or otherwise disposing of any interest held by or due to Sterman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sterman filed a timely notice of appeal from the new order, entered February 25, 1994, and it is that appeal that is now before us.  Judge Zobel's order also provided that discovery should be completed by the end of May 1994 and a further conference was scheduled for June 1994.  However, the briefs are silent as to what developments, if any, have occurred in the district court since the order now sought to be appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE ISSUES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  The first question concerns our jurisdiction, and a related claim of waiver raised by Xerox-VKM.  The district court's order was in part an explicit preliminary injunction;  such injunctions can be appealed immediately, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a)(1), and Sterman's appeal was filed within the requisite period.  But, argues Xerox-VKM, this should not give Sterman a right to relitigate issues on appeal that he raised by motion in October 1993, lost in the district court, and chose then not to appeal.  According to Xerox-VKM, Sterman has \"waived\" his right to review of the district court's rejection of his attacks on the judgments.  These, of course, are the only issues that Sterman wants to litigate on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We regard both of Sterman's motions in the district court as in substance motions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) to set aside final judgments.  In form the consent judgments were both final judgments;  the principal relief sought in Sterman's two motions was effectively to set aside the judgments;  and the arguments made in the motions concerned the validity and enforceability of the judgments rather than the technicalities of trustee process.  Apparently both sides share this view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is immediately appealable since there is nothing left to do in the district court.  See, e.g., FDIC v. Ramirez Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"519492\"><a href=\"/opinion/519492/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-v-juan-jesus-ramirez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">869</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>, 626 (1st Cir.1989).  Here neither denial of Rule 60(b) relief ended the proceedings;  they were ongoing at the time of both orders and so far as we know continue today.  This raises interesting questions about the appealability of a Rule 60(b) denial in the context of an ongoing district court proceeding.  See 15B C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 3916, at 363 (2d ed. 1992) (\"[Appeal] may be denied if the motion seems bound up with other proceedings that remain to be concluded.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view it is sufficient that as part of its February order the district court entered a preliminary injunction in aid of enforcement of the judgments.  The preliminary injunction is immediately appealable and is itself colorably dependent on the denial of motions to vacate the judgments.  \"Our jurisdiction embraces a consideration of such questions as are basic to and underlie the order supporting the appeal.\"  Alloyd Gen. Corp. v. Building Leasing Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"271962\"><a href=\"/opinion/271962/alloyd-general-corporation-v-building-leasing-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span>, 363 (1st Cir.1966).  Certainly the district court would not have continued the enforcement proceedings if it had agreed that the judgments deserved to be set aside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Xerox-VKM's waiver argument.  The analogy it offers is to one who, having suffered an adverse judgment, seeks to set it aside under Rule 60(b);  fails;  does not appeal;  and then, when the time for appealing has passed, renews the very same arguments in a new motion under Rule 60(b) and then seeks to appeal the new denial.  In Burnside v. Eastern Airlines, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"328952\"><a href=\"/opinion/328952/everett-burnside-v-eastern-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1127</span> </a></span>(5th Cir.1975), cited to us by Xerox-VKM, the court held that the moving party could not effectively pursue an out of time appeal by the expedient of renewing the same motion later on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty with the analogy is that even if the October and February motions are treated as raising the same arguments, although with different emphases, it is by no means clear that Sterman could have appealed the denial of the October motion.  At that time, there was no grant of a preliminary injunction as the vehicle for an immediate appeal.  Xerox-VKM gives us no reason or precedent to show that such an appeal was possible.  If an appeal was not possible, the waiver argument is pretty lame.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these somewhat unusual circumstances, we think that the proper course is to reject the waiver argument and to treat Sterman's claims as sufficiently related to the clearly appealable injunction to justify our consideration of them on the merits.  Since we think that the claims fail on the merits, it is enough to assume arguendo that the waiver and relatedness points are resolved in Sterman's favor.  See, e.g., Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Nat'l Bank v. Howard Communications Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596107\"><a href=\"/opinion/596107/rhode-island-hospital-trust-national-bank-v-howard-communications/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></a></span>, 829 (1st Cir.1992) (avoiding difficult jurisdictional issue to resolve merits of interlocutory appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. We turn now to the main arguments raised in Sterman's February motion under Rule 60(b).  The consent judgments are on their face unqualified final judgments against Sterman, totally almost $6 million.  Still, under the settlement agreement the enforcement of the final judgments was made contingent on Sterman's breach of the agreement.  Had Sterman complied with the agreement, Sterman would be entitled to some form of protection--we need not decide what kind.  But despite Sterman's original claim to have complied, it is undisputed that he did not pay the $125,000 promised by July 19 as provided in the written agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sterman might still obtain relief by an affirmative showing of grounds sufficient to persuade a district court to exercise its authority under Rule 60(b) to set aside the judgments.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Rule 60(b) needs to be emphasized because, while Rule 60(b) relief is not wholly a matter of discretion, relief from a final judgment is \"extraordinary\";  discretion plays a role;  and neither the grounds nor the procedures are as rigidly prescribed as those that would attend an ordinary lawsuit seeking a judgment in the first instance.  Vasapolli v. Rostoff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195712\"><a href=\"/opinion/195712/vasapolli-v-rostoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 37 n. 8 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, we consider first Sterman's argument that the judgments represent a contract \"penalty\" forbidden by Illinois law, in view of the supposed disproportion between the $125,000 immediately owed and the almost $6 million sought to be collected under the judgments.  The parties appear to treat Illinois law as controlling on this point because of the stipulation in the settlement agreement.  They are arguably mistaken (for reasons explained below) but state law is pertinent by analogy and Illinois is a perfectly good example.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Illinois does refuse to enforce penalties in contracts, see, e.g., Lake River Corp. v. Carborundum Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"456374\"><a href=\"/opinion/456374/lake-river-corporation-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-carborundum/\"><span class=\"volume\">769</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1284</span></a></span>, 1288-91 (7th Cir.1985);  Bauer v. Sawyer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2064641\"><a href=\"/opinion/2064641/bauer-v-sawyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2064641\"><a href=\"/opinion/2064641/bauer-v-sawyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">329</span></a></span>, 333-34 (1956), but the rule may have little to do with final judgments.  Indeed, even a contract agreeing to settle a pending or threatened suit--technically, a contract of \"accord\"--may be enforceable despite claims that it constitutes a penalty.  Williston says that the penalty defense is not available in such cases;  and the sparse case law is divided, weighted slightly in favor of Williston.  See generally 5 Williston, Contracts Sec. 780, at 700-01 (3d ed. 1961).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rationale for the rule against enforcing penalties in contract cases is not crystal clear.  But it is not hard to imagine why a court might be loath to enforce a contract provision specifying a disproportionately large sum--which courts call a penalty--for breach of the contract.  The parties may make such an agreement far in advance of the dispute and may not appreciate the full impact if the unlikely breach does occur.  Contract damages, broadly speaking, aim at compensation, not at punishment.  Finally, courts do not like results that appear unjust.  See Lake <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"456374\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">River,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/456374/lake-river-corporation-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-carborundum/\"><span class=\"volume\">769</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1288-91</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The force of such concerns is lessened where one is dealing with a contract of accord that is entered into after the dispute has arisen.  At this point, the parties are focusing on the strength of the claims, the likely damages and the costs of litigating.  If the defendant, or potential defendant, now consents to judgment in a specific amount, it is ordinarily done with eyes wide open, and in large matters usually with legal advice.  These attitudes seem to underlie the Williston view that the defendant should be constrained in attacking his own settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts that share this view may also feel that the plaintiff, who in settlement often accepts less than is claimed, ought not then be forced to litigate anew about the propriety of the discounted amount.  After all, the settlement may be attractive just because it assures that litigation about liability and amounts is over.  If this view is taken of a contract in accord, one would expect the same considerations to apply several times over to insulate from penalty defenses a court-entered consent judgment, which is one step further down the line (and a very important step).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present case is somewhat different from an ordinary consent judgment since Sterman's consent judgments, although final in form, were contingent as to enforcement on a default by Sterman.  In that sense the analogy to a contract in accord may be a good one.  We have found no Illinois state decisions on whether the penalty defense applies to contracts of accord.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  To the extent we were forced to guess at what Illinois law might be, we would incline toward following the Williston view that something far more than a showing of \"penalty\" is needed to defeat an obligation expressly assumed to settle a pending or threatened law suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is more, we are not concerned here directly with a contract suit governed by Illinois law but with a motion to reopen a federal judgment under Rule 60(b).  While state law on contracts is very instructive--that is why we have discussed it--\"[t]he grounds and the procedure for setting aside a federal judgment are entirely a matter of federal law, on which state law may be disregarded.\"   11 Wright &amp; Miller, supra, Sec. 2353, at 147-48;  see also Johnson Chemical Co. v. Condado Center, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"300913\"><a href=\"/opinion/300913/johnson-chemical-co-inc-v-condado-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1044</span></a></span>, 1046 (1st Cir.1972).  Even if Illinois did regard a contract in accord as subject to a penalty defense, it is debatable whether the district court would have been forced to use the same standard in deciding whether to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, there is no showing that enforcement of the judgments involves a penalty.  This case does not involve in isolation the collection of $6 million for failure to pay a $125,000 debt.  Any judgment about disproportion would depend on the reasonable magnitude of all of the claims settled by the May 19 settlement and all of the benefits received by Xerox-VKM.  The settlement covered four lawsuits, three projects, and a substantial number of claims and counterclaims.  Xerox-VKM may well receive less than it was originally entitled to even if it collects the $6 million in judgments and keeps or collects everything else that it was given or promised under the settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the penalty defense were available, it was Sterman's burden to make a colorable showing of overall disproportion through affidavits before the district court needed even consider taking the claim seriously.  His jumble of assertions and conclusions does not even begin to make such a showing.  Xerox-VKM appears to assert that even collection of the full judgment will not make them whole but this is beside the point.  What they bargained for in the settlement included the right not to have to prove the actual amount of their claims.  Instead, Sterman now has them arguing about the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This discussion also disposes of Sterman's related claim that he ought to receive \"credit\" against the judgments for the value of assets transferred on May 19.  At first glance, this might seem to be a straightforward suggestion that the defendant suffered a judgment, paid part of it, and should naturally be held to owe only the unpaid balance.  When one understands what Sterman is actually saying, his claim is seen to depend on the same kind of false comparison as his penalty argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the settlement agreement suggests that the amounts specified in the consent judgments are to be reduced by the assets transferred on the same day as the agreement was signed and well before the judgments were even entered.  So far as we know, the transfers themselves may be nothing more than the clearing of title to assets already held by Xerox-VKM as security.  And while such security if realized would probably reduce liability, Sterman has (as noted) provided us with nothing to suggest that Xerox-VKM has or ever will collect as much as they might have done if the Sterman entities had complied with their original commitments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.  This disposes of the arguments made by Sterman in his February motion, but he also seeks to brief in this court additional arguments made in his October motion.  Pertinently, he claims that parol agreements, both before and after the May 19 agreement, made Sterman's payment of the $125,000 contingent on his ability to resell the Brush bonds and provided that the July 19 closing date would be extended upon Sterman's request.  For reasons already set forth, we think that these claims have arguably been preserved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the oral argument on the October motion, Judge Zobel brushed aside the Sterman's claim that Xerox-VKM had from the outset orally agreed to such a linkage or a right of Sterman to extend at will.  Her ruling was understandable:  the May 19 agreement was a complex, lawyer-crafted, written document and it made no mention of any such linkage or right;  on the contrary, it said that time was of the essence, adding only that the parties could agree to extend the closing date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under parol evidence rules, followed in Illinois as elsewhere, evidence of an alleged \"prior or contemporaneous agreement[ ]\" is inadmissible if \"it would have been normal for the parties to incorporate [such an agreement] in the written instrument....\"  Roth v.

In this case, the parol evidence rule applies with full force.  Once again, it does not matter whether Illinois law governs the decision under Rule 60(b) whether to reopen the judgments, for it is at least instructive by analogy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the parol evidence rule generally governs only prior or contemporaneous agreements.

Further, between May 19 and the scheduled closing date, Xerox-VKM twice wrote to Sterman to reconfirm his remaining obligations;  neither letter evidenced any flexibility on the date and one explicitly reminded Sterman that he would be in default if he failed to fulfill his obligations by July 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, on July 19 Sterman himself faxed a letter to a Xerox-VKM representative requesting an extension of the closing date.  He made no claim that Xerox-VKM had agreed to extend the closing date or that he had any unilateral right to an extension.  Far from granting an extension, Xerox-VKM wrote to Sterman the next day informing him that he had defaulted on his payment obligation, that the judgments against him could now be executed, and that his opportunity to purchase the Brush bonds had now expired.
