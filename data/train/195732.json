Armand P.

He  failed  to appear  for\n\nsentencing, but  was later apprehended while  trying to enter\n\nthe  United States from Canada.   This episode  resulted in a\n\nseven count  indictment  that included  assaulting a  federal\n\nofficer and the  use of a  firearm; making false  statements,\n\nand  failing to  report currency importation  (some $178,000)\n\nand, for good measure, failure to have appeared for the prior\n\nsentencing.   To his conviction on the  information there was\n\nadded,  in  due course,  convictions  on  all counts  in  the\n\nindictment.  On this joint appeal defendant complains  of the\n\ncourt's excluding his proffered excuse for non-appearance for\n\nsentencing;  its admitting  evidence  of the  testing of  the\n\nfirearm; and  various rulings with respect to sentencing.  We\n\naffirm.\n\n                      Failure to Appear\r                                                   \n\n          18  U.S.C.    3146(a)(1)  made it  an  offense  for\n\ndefendant knowingly to  fail to appear  for sentencing.   His\n\ndefense  lay   in   subsection  (c),   \"that   uncontrollable\n\ncircumstances  prevented  . . . appearing.\"   \"Circumstances\"\n\nfall  into two  categories, physical  and mental,  the latter\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nbest  characterized as duress.  There was no question here of\n\nphysical  prevention.      Uncontrollable  duress   must   be\n\nsufficient to produce an  unavoidable fear of \"serious bodily\n\ninjury or death.\"  Cf. United States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288,\r                                                          \n\n291  (1st  Cir.) cert.  denied  sub  nom. Sanchez  v.

Defendant's  excluded offer\r                  \n\nwas that he had  lost faith in  the judicial system and  that\n\nbecause  he  had  refused  to  furnish  the  prosecutor  with\n\nfavorable  testimony  in  another  case  he feared  reprisal.\n\nObviously  this must  have meant  conduct in  connection with\n\nsentencing, or sentencing procedure, not bodily injury.  Even\n\nwere  we to assume that defendant had a well-grounded fear of\n\nwhat,  in his  opinion, would be  an improper  sentence, this\n\ncould  not justify  a failure  to appear.   United  States v.\r                                                                      \n\nOdufowora,  814  F.2d 73,  74 (1st  Cir.  1987).   This would\r                     \n\npractically put  appearance  for sentencing  on  a  voluntary\n\nbasis.\n\n                         Test Firing\r                                                \n\n          The government  apparently conceded that it had the\n\nburden  of showing  that defendant's  firearm was  operable,2\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  The statute, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(3), would appear to require\nless.   It states, \"The  term 'firearm' means  (A) any weapon\n. . .  which will  or  is  designed  to  or  may  readily  be\nconverted  to   expel  a  projectile  by  the  action  of  an\nexplosive.\"   See also United  States v. Ruiz,  986 F.2d 905,\r                                                         \n910 (5th Cir.), (holding that under this particular provision\nof the statute the government need not prove that the  gun is\ncapable  of firing  so long  as it  demonstrates that  it was\r                       \ndesigned  to fire), cert. denied  sub nom. Crawford v. United\r                                                                         \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nand when, two days before trial,  an expected stipulation was\n\nnot forthcoming, it  conducted a successful test.   No report\n\nthereof was  conveyed to defendant.   He claimed  that, where\n\ngeneral  discovery   had  been  sought,  Fed.   R.  Crim.  P.\n\n16(a)(1)(D)  required disclosure  of  even  an  oral  report.\n\nAccordingly  he sought  the  sanction of  exclusion, and  now\n\nappeals from the court's refusal.\n\n          Defendant  argues  that  although  we   have  never\n\ndecided the  matter of oral reports, certain dictum in United\r                                                                         \n\nStates  v.

The court properly found that\n\ndefense  counsel's knowledge as displayed in cross-examining,\n\nand his  failure to  ask for  a continuance  or to  offer any\n\nsuggestion  of  prejudice,  showed  that   no  prejudice  was\n\nsuffered.    Even if  the  burden  be thought  to  be on  the\n\ngovernment  we find no  abuse of discretion  in admitting the\n\nevidence.   United States v.  Shue, 766 F.2d  1122, 1135 (7th\r                                              \n\nCir.  1985); United States v.

Defendant  was\n\nrepresented  by two, to all appearances competent, attorneys,\n\nwho participated throughout.  There was a lobby conference on\n\nsentencing, followed by a hearing the next day to resolve the\n\nissues that had not been agreed to.  At that time  individual\n\ncomputations  and a  cumulative  sentence were  reached.   No\n\nobjections  were  voiced.    The  appeal  would  raise  three\n\nmatters:  that the  court failed to consider the  evidence in\n\nfinding  that  defendant had  the  ability  to  pay the  fine\n\nimposed;   that  it   erred   in   finding   defendant   used\n\nsophisticated  means to  impede  discovery  of liability  for\n\ntaxes (U.S.S.G.   2T1.1(b)(2)); and that the evidence did not\n\nwarrant a  finding that defendant  had received in  excess of\n\n$10,000 from illegal activity.  U.S.S.G.   2T1.1(b)(1).\n\n          Objections raised  at the lobby  conference did not\n\ncarry  over to the hearing, but merely defined what was there\n\nto  be  further considered.   The  fact that  neither counsel\n\nvoiced objection to the final rulings, and thus saved rights,\n\nis obvious.  United States v. Haggert, 980 F.2d 8, 10-11 (1st\r                                                 \n\nCir. 1992).

Veilleux, whom the district court described as a one-person crime wave, waived indictment and pled guilty to a three count information charging conspiracies to possess, and to distribute, in excess of 500 grams of cocaine, and to evade the payment of income taxes.  He failed to appear for sentencing, but was later apprehended while trying to enter the United States from Canada.  This episode resulted in a seven count indictment that included assaulting a federal officer and the use of a firearm;  making false statements, and failing to report currency importation (some $178,000) and, for good measure, failure to have appeared for the prior sentencing.  To his conviction on the information there was added, in due course, convictions on all counts in the indictment.  On this joint appeal defendant complains of the court's excluding his proffered excuse for non-appearance for sentencing;  its admitting evidence of the testing of the firearm;  and various rulings with respect to sentencing.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Failure to Appear</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. Sec. 3146(a)(1) made it an offense for defendant knowingly to fail to appear for sentencing.  His defense lay in subsection (c), \"that uncontrollable circumstances prevented ... appearing.\"  \"Circumstances\" fall into two categories, physical and mental, the latter best characterized as duress.  There was no question here of physical prevention.  Uncontrollable duress must be sufficient to produce an unavoidable fear of \"serious bodily injury or death.\"   Cf. United States v. Amparo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581358\"><a href=\"/opinion/581358/united-states-v-luz-maria-amparo-aka-luz-maria-amparo-sanchez/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 291 (1st Cir.) cert. denied sub nom.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span> </span>(1992).  Defendant's excluded offer was that he had lost faith in the judicial system and that because he had refused to furnish the prosecutor with favorable testimony in another case he feared reprisal.  Obviously this must have meant conduct in connection with sentencing, or sentencing procedure, not bodily injury.  Even were we to assume that defendant had a well-grounded fear of what, in his opinion, would be an improper sentence, this could not justify a failure to appear.  United States v. Odufowora, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484938\"><a href=\"/opinion/484938/united-states-v-mohammed-odufowora/\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir.1987).  This would practically put appearance for sentencing on a voluntary basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Test Firing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government apparently conceded that it had the burden of showing that defendant's firearm was operable,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and when, two days before trial, an expected stipulation was not forthcoming, it conducted a successful test.  No report thereof was conveyed to defendant.  He claimed that, where general discovery had been sought, Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(D) required disclosure of even an oral report.  Accordingly he sought the sanction of exclusion, and now appeals from the court's refusal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that although we have never decided the matter of oral reports, certain dictum in United States v. Tejada, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529942\"><a href=\"/opinion/529942/united-states-v-alberto-tejada-united-states-of-america-v-juan-ignacio/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span>, 486 (1st Cir.1989), indicates that we would lean in that direction.  We need not, however, reach that question.  The court properly found that defense counsel's knowledge as displayed in cross-examining, and his failure to ask for a continuance or to offer any suggestion of prejudice, showed that no prejudice was suffered.  Even if the burden be thought to be on the government we find no abuse of discretion in admitting the evidence.  United States v. Shue, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454720\"><a href=\"/opinion/454720/united-states-v-charles-shue/\"><span class=\"volume\">766</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1122</span></a></span>, 1135 (7th Cir.1985);  United States v. Glaze, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"388141\"><a href=\"/opinion/388141/united-states-v-larry-glaze-and-robert-loyd/\"><span class=\"volume\">643</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, 552 (8th Cir.1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The number and variety of the charges against defendant are demonstrated by the government's extensive brief devoted to sentencing analysis.  Defendant was represented by two, to all appearances competent, attorneys, who participated throughout.  There was a lobby conference on sentencing, followed by a hearing the next day to resolve the issues that had not been agreed to.  At that time individual computations and a cumulative sentence were reached.  No objections were voiced.  The appeal would raise three matters:  that the court failed to consider the evidence in finding that defendant had the ability to pay the fine imposed;  that it erred in finding defendant used sophisticated means to impede discovery of liability for taxes (U.S.S.G. Sec. 2T1.1(b)(2));  and that the evidence did not warrant a finding that defendant had received in excess of $10,000 from illegal activity.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2T1.1(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Objections raised at the lobby conference did not carry over to the hearing, but merely defined what was there to be further considered.  The fact that neither counsel voiced objection to the final rulings, and thus saved rights, is obvious.  United States v. Haggert, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595476\"><a href=\"/opinion/595476/united-states-v-lloyd-r-haggert/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 10-11 (1st Cir.1992).  The failure is ignored, or blithely sought to be answered by a simple assertion of \"plain error.\"   This invites an equally abrupt response:  Not so fast.  Plain error carries a heavy burden.

Concemi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578607\"><a href=\"/opinion/578607/united-states-v-samuel-j-concemi-united-states-of-america-v-walter/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span>, 945 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v.
