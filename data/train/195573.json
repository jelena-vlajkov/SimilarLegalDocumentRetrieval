Claimant,  Andres  Ortiz  Ortiz,  has\n                     \n\nappealed a  district court  judgment affirming a  decision of\n\nthe Secretary  of Health  and Human Services  (the Secretary)\n\nwhich  denied  Ortiz's application  for  disability insurance\n\nbenefits  under the Social Security  Act, 42 U.S.C.    401 et\n                                                             \n\nseq..   The Secretary concluded that  Ortiz was not precluded\n    \n\nfrom  performing  other  substantial  gainful  activity  that\n\nexisted in the national  economy, i.e., the Secretary carried\n                                      \n\nthe  burden of  proof  at Step  5  of the  sequential  review\n\nprocess.

We have reviewed the\n      \n\nparties'  briefs and  the record  on appeal.   We  affirm the\n\njudgment of the district court, entered on December 31, 1993,\n\nessentially for the reasons  stated by the administrative law\n\njudge and district court.\n\n          1.   With respect to claimant's contention that the\n\nALJ,  a  lay  person,  could not  permissibly  conclude  that\n\nclaimant  retained the residual functional capacity for light\n\nwork absent an RFC evaluation from a physician, we agree with\n\nthe  district court's analysis.  Given the dearth of evidence\n\nof  any continuing  physical  impairment, whether  claimant's\n\nalleged pain  imposed any exertional limitation  was an issue\n\nof credibility to be determined  under the standard set forth\n\nin Avery v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., 797 F.2d 19\n                                                \n\n(1st Cir. 1986).\n\n                             -2-\n\n          2.   Plaintiff asserts that  the ALJ  did not  give\n\nproper  consideration to his  allegations of  disabling pain.\n\nSuch allegations of  pain must  be considered by  the ALJ  in\n\naccordance with  Avery.  The hearing  transcript and findings\n                      \n\namply   demonstrate   that   the   inquiry   into  claimant s\n\nallegations of pain conformed with Avery.\n                                        \n\n      Judgment affirmed.\n                       \n\n                             -3-\n",
