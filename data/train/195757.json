Jose Ventura-Ramos  appeals the  district\r                            \n\ncourt's  judgment denying  his motion  filed  pursuant to  28\n\nU.S.C.   2255.   He presses none of the claims  raised in the\n\ncourt  below.   At best,  he  has reconfigured  one of  those\n\nclaims.   In the  district court, he  claimed that  he should\n\nhave  received a four level  downward adjustment as a minimal\n\nparticipant in the offenses of conviction, U.S.S.G.  3B1.2(a)\n\n(Nov.  1991), and he  received ineffective assistance  by his\n\ntrial counsel,  who failed  to ask for  this adjustment.   On\n\nappeal,  he now  claims that  he should  have received  a two\n\nlevel downward  adjustment as a  minor participant,  U.S.S.G.\n\n 3B1.2(b) (Nov. 1991), and he received ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel,  not only from  his trial counsel, who  failed to\n\nask for this adjustment, but also from his appellate counsel,\n\nwho  failed to  raise this  issue on his  direct appeal.   We\n\naffirm.\n\n     We have repeatedly stated that we will not review claims\n\nnot raised below.  See, e.g., United States v. Lilly, 13 F.3d\r                                                                \n\n15, 17-18 (1st Cir. 1994).  Even were we to construe Ventura-\n\nRamos' reconfigured claim as  having been encompassed  within\n\nthe claim  raised below,  it  avails appellant  nothing.   He\n\nalleges that  he was a  minor participant in the  offenses of\n\nconviction  based  on   his  claims  of  mere   presence  and\n\nwillingness  to allow others to  use his apartment to conduct\n\nthe drug sale.  Those  claims are refuted by the evidence  at\r\r\n\ntrial   concerning  Ventura-Ramos'   role  in   the  offense,\n\nrecounted  in  our opinion  disposing  of  appellant's direct\n\nappeal, United States v. Ventura-Ramos, No. 92-1434, slip op.\r                                                  \n\nat 2-3 (1st Cir. Nov.  13, 1992 (unpublished per curiam), and\n\nby the statements of the  district court at sentencing and in\n\nthe course  of disposing  of the instant    2255  motion that\n\nVentura-Ramos  had a leadership role in the drug distribution\n\nconspiracy.\n\n     No  defendant  is automatically  entitled to  a downward\n\nadjustment  as a  minor participant,  even  if the  defendant\r                                                          \n\nhappens to be less culpable than his or her co-defendants - a\n\nclaim  Ventura-Ramos urges  here but, as  pointed out  in the\n\npreceding paragraph,  is refuted by  the record.   See United\r                                                                         \n\nStates v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 460 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\r                                                                        \n\n115 S. Ct.  80, 81 (1994).  A  district court's determination\n\nof  a defendant's  role  in  the offense  is  subject to  the\n\nclearly erroneous  standard.   Id.  There  was no  such error\r                                              \n\nhere.  Further,  counsel's failure to raise  meritless issues\n\ncannot  constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.
