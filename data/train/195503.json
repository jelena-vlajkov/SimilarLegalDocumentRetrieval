This is a pro se appeal from a summary\n                                       \n\njudgment  entered  by the  district  court  in  favor of  the\n\ngovernment  and  against  plaintiffs-appellants,   Gerard  A.\n\nCormier (\"Cormier\"), his wife and children.  We affirm.\n\n                          Background\n                                    \n\n     In October,  1992, Cormier filed  a complaint pro  se in\n                                                          \n\nthe  United  States  District   Court  for  the  District  of\n\nMassachusetts on  behalf of himself and  his family, claiming\n\nviolation  of  the  Federal   Tort  Claims  Act  (\"FTCA\").1  \n\nEssentially,  Cormier claims  that  his former  employer, the\n\nUnited  States Department  of the Treasury,  Internal Revenue\n\nService (\"IRS\"),  and the United States  Department of Labor,\n\nOffice of Workers Compensation  Programs (\"OWCP\") caused pain\n\nand suffering to Cormier and his  family as a result of their\n\nmishandling of his worker's compensation claim.\n\n     Cormier  had  filed  a  worker's  compensation claim  in\n\nFebruary,  1979, claiming  a \"disabling  emotional condition\"\n\nresulting  from harassment  by  an irate  taxpayer and  other\n\nwork-related   stresses.2     The   OWCP   originally  denied\n\n                    \n\n1.   Cormier, acting pro se,  is representing himself and his\n                           \nwife  and children  in  this appeal.    This court  generally\nprohibits non-lawyers from representing litigants  other than\nthemselves.  See Amann  v. Stow School System, 982  F.2d 644,\n                                             \n648 n.2 (1st Cir.  1992).  \"However, because we affirm on the\nmerits, we  need not determine whether  [Cormier's wife's and\nchildren's appeals] are properly before us.\"  Id.\n                                                 \n\n2.  This   procedural   history    of   Cormier's    worker's\ncompensation claim is taken from his complaint.\n\n                             -2-\n\nCormier's claim on the ground that  his emotional illness was\n\nnot caused by the  conditions of his employment.   On appeal,\n\nthe  case  was remanded  to  resolve  a conflict  in  medical\n\nopinions.  \n\n     The OWCP granted Cormier an award in July, 1984, only to\n\nrescind  the award in October,  1984.  Cormier  appealed to a\n\nhearing officer and eventually  to the Employees Compensation\n\nAppeals Board (\"ECAB\").   After a hearing, the ECAB  ruled in\n\nCormier's favor  and,in an opinion dated  September 18, 1986,\n\nremanded to the OWCP for referral to a medical specialist for\n\nan  impartial  medical  evaluation  to  be  followed  by  the\n\nissuance of a de novo decision.  In February,  1988, the OWCP\n                     \n\nawarded benefits to  Cormier.  His  request for interest  and\n\nattorneys' fees was denied.   \n\n     In  his   complaint,  Cormier  requests   the  following\n\ncompensation for the alleged  violation of the FTCA: interest\n\non the worker's compensation award, attorneys' fees and costs\n\nfor the worker's compensation case, three days' pay allegedly\n\nstill due, and $500,000  for each of the five  plaintiffs for\n\nemotional distress, pain and  suffering.  In September, 1993,\n\nthe government moved for summary judgment on the grounds that\n\nCormier's failure to  file an  administrative claim  deprived\n\nthe district  court of jurisdiction  over the tort  claim and\n\nthat the  OWCP's denial of  interest and attorneys'  fees was\n\nnot reviewable by a court of law.\n\n                             -3-\n\n     Judge  William G.  Young of  the United  States District\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts held a motion hearing\n\non November  23, 1993.   Cormier was represented  by counsel.\n\nThe hearing was  held at  the Boston College  School of  Law,\n\napparently before a group of law students.  At the conclusion\n\nof the  hearing, the district  court granted  the motion  for\n\nsummary judgment  for lack of subject  matter jurisdiction on\n\nthe  ground of  Cormier's failure  to file  an administrative\n\nclaim.  The district court did not issue a written opinion.\n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n     We review  a district court's grant  of summary judgment\n\nde novo.  See  Calenti v. Boto, et al., No. 93-1759, slip op.\n                                     \n\nat 6 (1st Cir. May 23, 1994).  \"We read  the record indulging\n\nall inferences  in favor  of the  non-moving party.   Summary\n\njudgment  is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law.\"   Id. (citations omitted).\n                      \n\n     Cormier raises two issues  on appeal.  First, he  argues\n\nthat the motion hearing conducted by  Judge Young amounted to\n\na denial of due process because he was  not given an adequate\n\nopportunity  to address  the court,  the court  discriminated\n\nagainst  his  out-of-state  attorney,  the  classroom  format\n\nimposed unreasonable time restrictions on the hearing and the\n\ncourt was  unfamiliar with the  contents of the  case record.\n\nSecond, Cormier  contests the court's finding  that he failed\n\n                             -4-\n\nto  file the  required administrative tort claim in  a timely\n\nfashion.\n\n     There is simply  no support in the  record for Cormier's\n\nclaim  that he  was  denied a  fair  hearing on  the  summary\n\njudgment motion.    A  review  of  the  transcript  from  the\n\nmotion hearing  indicates that the district  court gave ample\n\nopportunity  to  Cormier  and  his  attorney  to  make  their\n\narguments,  treated  both parties  and  their  attorneys with\n\nrespect,  demonstrated   a  complete  understanding   of  the\n\nrelevant  facts and  law  and decided  the motion  correctly.\n\nAlthough the forum  for the hearing was somewhat  unusual, it\n\ndid  not deprive Cormier of a  fair hearing.  Nor did Cormier\n\nobject  to the forum, although he had advance notice that the\n\nhearing would be held at Boston College Law School.  \n\n     The  district  court   correctly  ruled  that  Cormier's\n\nfailure  to  file  an  administrative claim  deprived  it  of\n\njurisdiction  over   Cormier's   tort  claims   against   the\n\ngovernment.   The  timely filing  of an  administrative claim\n\nwith  the appropriate  federal  agency  is  a  jurisdictional\n\nprerequisite to the  prosecution of  an FTCA claim.   See  28\n                                                         \n\nU.S.C.   2675(a); see  also Cotto v. United States,  993 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n274,  280 (1st  Cir. 1993).   The  district court  found that\n\nplaintiffs had failed to file an administrative claim on time\n\nand, therefore, dismissed the  case for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nCormier argues on appeal  that his letter to the  ECAB, dated\n\n                             -5-\n\nOctober  1,  1990,   constituted  an  administrative   claim.\n\nAlternatively,  he argues that the  Form 95s that  he and the\n\nother  plaintiffs  filed  in  November,  1993  satisfied  the\n\nadministrative claim requirement.  \n\n     \"This   circuit   approaches   the  notice   requirement\n\nleniently,\"  Santiago-Ramirez   v.  Secretary  of   Dep't  of\n                                                             \n\nDefense, 984 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 1993). Cormier's letter to\n       \n\nthe  ECAB,   however,  failed   to  meet  even   the  minimal\n\nrequirements imposed  by  this court:  that the  notification\n\ninclude  \"1)   sufficient  information  for   the  agency  to\n\ninvestigate the claims, and 2) the amount of damages sought.\"\n\nId.  \n   \n\n     The  letter requested  that the  ECAB review  the OWCP's\n\naward to Cormier, specifically  its failure to award interest\n\nand attorneys' fees.   In  the last sentence  of his  letter,\n\nCormier states his  belief that \"this  is being filed  within\n\none year of  the decision as I  thought the check of  10/2/89\n\nwould include the interest for the 10 years,\" indicating that\n\nthe  letter was intended as an appeal from the OWCP's failure\n\nto   award  interest  and  attorneys'  fees.    There  is  no\n\nsuggestion  in the  letter that  Cormier was  also requesting\n\ndamages  for himself  and his family  for emotional  pain and\n\nsuffering.  By failing to state the most basic information --\n\nthe  type  of  injury  alleged  and  the  amount  of  damages\n\nrequested  as  compensation for  that  injury  -- the  letter\n\n                             -6-\n\nclearly  fails  to  fulfill  the statutory  requirement.  See\n                                                             \n\nSantiago-Ramirez, 984 F.2d at 20 (letter  fulfilled statutory\n                \n\nrequirement where  it stated the  type of injury  alleged and\n\nthe amount  of damages  requested  and \"adequately  indicated\n\nthat  appellant's  complaint  was premised  on  her emotional\n\ndistress and mental suffering.\")\n\n     At best, Cormier's letter  gave notice to the government\n\nof  his  claims  for  interest and  attorneys'  fees.   Those\n\nclaims, however, amount to a request for review of the OWCP's\n\naward under the Federal  Employee's Compensation Act.   It is\n\nwell  established that we have no jurisdiction to review such\n\nawards.   \"The Secretary  [of Labor's]  action in  denying or\n\ngranting compensation is final and conclusive and may not  be\n\nreviewed by a court of law. 5 U.S.C.   8128(b)(1) and (2) and\n\n  8145.\" Bruni  v. United States,  964 F.2d 76, 79  (1st Cir.\n                                \n\n1992) (footnote omitted).\n\n     The  administrative  claim  forms  (Form  95s)  filed by\n\nCormier  and his  family  in November,  1993  also failed  to\n\nfulfill  the statutory  requirement.   The  forms were  filed\n\nafter  Cormier commenced  the FTCA  action in  federal court.\n\nThe Supreme Court recently held  that a district court lacked\n\njurisdiction over  an FTCA action where  \"the claimant failed\n\nto exhaust his administrative  remedies prior to filing suit,\n\nbut did  so  before  substantial  progress was  made  in  the\n\nlitigation.\"  McNeil v. United States,  113 S. Ct. 1980, 1981\n                                     \n\n                             -7-\n\n(1993).  The Court specifically held that a litigant's pro se\n                                                             \n\nstatus  does  not  excuse  his  failure  timely  to  file  an\n\nadministrative claim. Id. at 1984.3\n                         \n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the district court's entry of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the government is affirmed.\n\n                    \n\n3.  The  Form 95s are also insufficient in that they were not\nfiled within  the two-year statute of  limitations period for\nFTCA  claims.  See 28  U.S.C.   2401(b).   Cormier's argument\n                  \nthat   his  children's   minority  tolled   the   statute  of\nlimitations  is  without merit.    See  Vega-Velez v.

Cormier appealed to a hearing officer and eventually to the Employees Compensation Appeals Board (\"ECAB\").  After a hearing, the ECAB ruled in Cormier's favor and,in an opinion dated September 18, 1986, remanded to the OWCP for referral to a medical specialist for an impartial medical evaluation to be followed by the issuance of a de novo decision.  In February, 1988, the OWCP awarded benefits to Cormier.

In September, 1993, the government moved for summary judgment on the grounds that Cormier's failure to file an administrative claim deprived the district court of jurisdiction over the tort claim and that the OWCP's denial of interest and attorneys' fees was not reviewable by a court of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge William G.

A review of the transcript from the motion hearing indicates that the district court gave ample opportunity to Cormier and his attorney to make their arguments, treated both parties and their attorneys with respect, demonstrated a complete understanding of the relevant facts and law and decided the motion correctly.  Although the forum for the hearing was somewhat unusual, it did not deprive Cormier of a fair hearing.  Nor did Cormier object to the forum, although he had advance notice that the hearing would be held at Boston College Law School.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly ruled that Cormier's failure to file an administrative claim deprived it of jurisdiction over Cormier's tort claims against the government.  The timely filing of an administrative claim with the appropriate federal agency is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the prosecution of an FTCA claim.  See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2675(a);   see also Cotto v. United States, 993 F.2d 274, 280 (1st Cir. 1993).  The district court found that plaintiffs had failed to file an administrative claim on time and, therefore, dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.  Cormier argues on appeal that his letter to the ECAB, dated October 1, 1990, constituted an administrative claim.  Alternatively, he argues that the Form 95s that he and the other plaintiffs filed in November, 1993 satisfied the administrative claim requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"This circuit approaches the notice requirement leniently,\"  Santiago-Ramirez v. Secretary of Dep't of Defense, 984 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 1993).  Cormier's letter to the ECAB, however, failed to meet even the minimal requirements imposed by this court:  that the notification include \"1) sufficient information for the agency to investigate the claims, and 2) the amount of damages sought.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter requested that the ECAB review the OWCP's award to Cormier, specifically its failure to award interest and attorneys' fees.  In the last sentence of his letter, Cormier states his belief that \"this is being filed within one year of the decision as I thought the check of 10/2/89 would include the interest for the 10 years,\" indicating that the letter was intended as an appeal from the OWCP's failure to award interest and attorneys' fees.  There is no suggestion in the letter that Cormier was also requesting damages for himself and his family for emotional pain and suffering.  By failing to state the most basic information-the type of injury alleged and the amount of damages requested as compensation for that injury-the letter clearly fails to fulfill the statutory requirement.   See Santiago-Ramirez, 984 F.2d at 20 (letter fulfilled statutory requirement where it stated the type of injury alleged and the amount of damages requested and \"adequately indicated that appellant's complaint was premised on her emotional distress and mental suffering.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At best, Cormier's letter gave notice to the government of his claims for interest and attorneys' fees.  Those claims, however, amount to a request for review of the OWCP's award under the Federal Employee's Compensation Act.  It is well established that we have no jurisdiction to review such awards.  \"The Secretary [of Labor's] action in denying or granting compensation is final and conclusive and may not be reviewed by a court of law.  5 U.S.C.

The forms were filed after Cormier commenced the FTCA action in federal court.  The Supreme Court recently held that a district court lacked jurisdiction over an FTCA action where \"the claimant failed to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing suit, but did so before substantial progress was made in the litigation.\"   McNeil v.

Cormier (\"Cormier\"), his wife and children.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October, 1992, Cormier filed a complaint pro se in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on behalf of himself and his family, claiming violation of the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Essentially, Cormier claims that his former employer, the United States Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"), and the United States Department of Labor, Office of Workers Compensation Programs (\"OWCP\") caused pain and suffering to Cormier and his family as a result of their mishandling of his worker's compensation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cormier had filed a worker's compensation claim in February, 1979, claiming a \"disabling emotional condition\" resulting from harassment by an irate taxpayer and other work- related stresses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The OWCP originally denied Cormier's claim on the ground that his emotional illness was not caused by the conditions of his employment.  On appeal, the case was remanded to resolve a conflict in medical opinions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The OWCP granted Cormier an award in July, 1984, only to rescind the award in October, 1984.  Cormier appealed to a hearing officer and eventually to the Employees Compensation Appeals Board (\"ECAB\").  After a hearing, the ECAB ruled in Cormier's favor and,in an opinion dated September 18, 1986, remanded to the OWCP for referral to a medical specialist for an impartial medical evaluation to be followed by the issuance of a de novo decision.  In February, 1988, the OWCP awarded benefits to Cormier.  His request for interest and attorneys' fees was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his complaint, Cormier requests the following compensation for the alleged violation of the FTCA:  interest on the worker's compensation award, attorneys' fees and costs for the worker's compensation case, three days' pay allegedly still due, and $500,000 for each of the five plaintiffs for emotional distress, pain and suffering.  In September, 1993, the government moved for summary judgment on the grounds that Cormier's failure to file an administrative claim deprived the district court of jurisdiction over the tort claim and that the OWCP's denial of interest and attorneys' fees was not reviewable by a court of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge William G. Young of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts held a motion hearing on November 23, 1993.  Cormier was represented by counsel.  The hearing was held at the Boston College School of Law, apparently before a group of law students.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court granted the motion for summary judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground of Cormier's failure to file an administrative claim.  The district court did not issue a written opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo.  See Calenti v. Boto, et al., No. 93-1759, slip op. at 6 (1st Cir.  May 23, 1994).  \"We read the record indulging all inferences in favor of the non-moving party.  Summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (citations omitted).</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cormier raises two issues on appeal.  First, he argues that the motion hearing conducted by Judge Young amounted to a denial of due process because he was not given an adequate opportunity to address the court, the court discriminated against his out-of-state attorney, the classroom format imposed unreasonable time restrictions on the hearing and the court was unfamiliar with the contents of the case record.
