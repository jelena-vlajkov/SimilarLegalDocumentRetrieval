Curran,\n                                                                 \nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n     Per  Curiam.  In this  28 U.S.C.    2255 petition, Louis\n                \n\nSimon  advances  two challenges  to  the  calculation of  his\n\nsentence under  the Sentencing Guidelines.   Specifically, he\n\nalleges that a two-level enhancement under   2C1.1(b)(1) (for\n\ncommitting  an  offense involving  \"more  than  one bribe  or\n\nextortion\") and  a three-level  enhancement under    3B1.1(b)\n\n(for being a  \"manager or leader\"  of criminal activity  that\n\n\"involved  five  or   more  participants  or  was   otherwise\n\nextensive\")  were each  imposed in  violation of the  Ex Post\n\nFacto  Clause.   Assuming  arguendo  that  petitioner is  not\n                                   \n\nprecluded from raising these issues in light of his waiver of\n\nthe  right  to appeal  in his  plea  agreement, we  find each\n\ncontention without merit.\n\n     The  latter argument  is  expressly  foreclosed by  this\n\ncourt's decision  in United States v.  Ruiz-Batista, 956 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n351  (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,  113 S.  Ct. 105 (1992).   We\n                              \n\nthere held that, because the pre-1990 Introductory Commentary\n\nto Chapter 3, Part B could be deemed ambiguous, Amendment 345\n\nserved  to  clarify this  passage  and so  could  properly be\n\napplied to offenses  occurring prior to November 1990.   See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g.,  Isabel v.  United States,  980 F.2d  60, 62  (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1992)   (\"clarifications\"  of   Guidelines  may   be  applied\n\nretroactively; \"substantive changes\" may not).\n\n     The former argument is likewise unavailing.  Contrary to\n\npetitioner's premise, the  district court was  entitled under\n\nthe 1989  Guidelines to  consider \"relevant conduct\"  under  \n\n1B1.3  for purposes  of  determining whether  \"more than  one\n\nbribe  or extortion\" had occurred.1  At all relevant times,  \n\n1B1.3(a)  provided that, unless otherwise specified, specific\n\noffense  characteristics (of which  the two-level enhancement\n\nhere  is  one) were  to  be determined  on the  basis  of the\n\nfollowing:\n\n     solely with respect to  offenses of a character for\n     which   3D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple\n     counts, all such acts  and omissions that were part\n     of the same  course of conduct or  common scheme or\n     plan as the offense of conviction. \n\n   1B1.3(a)(2).     The   district   court  determined   that\n\npetitioner's  other  extortionate  episodes  satisfied  these\n\ncriteria; petitioner has  not disputed this  finding.  As  of\n\n1989,2  extortion (a    2C1.1  offense) was  included in  the\n\nlist of offenses subject to grouping.  And Application Note 2\n\nto   1B1.3, as  it existed in 1989, specifically  stated that\n\nsubsection  (a)(2) \"applies  to offenses  of types  for which\n\nconvictions  on  multiple counts  would  be grouped  together\n\npursuant  to     3D1.2(d);   multiple  convictions  are   not\n                                                             \n\nrequired.\"  (Emphasis  added).  The 1990 and  1991 amendments\n         \n\n                    \n\n1.  Although  the  words  \"or  extortion\"  were  added  to   \n2C1.1(b)(1) only after petitioner's extortionate  conduct had\nbeen committed,  see U.S.S.G., App. C, Amend.  367 (1991), he\n                    \nhas raised  no argument that this  provision is inapplicable.\nWe therefore do  not address  the issue, other  than to  note\nthat one court has applied Amendment  367 retroactively.  See\n                                                             \nUnited States v. Loftus, 992 F.2d 793, 799 (8th Cir. 1993). \n                       \n\n2.  See U.S.S.G., App. C., Amend. 121 (1989). \n       \n\n                             -3-\n\nto Note  2, upon  which petitioner apparently  relies, served\n\nonly to  reinforce this  interpretation.  See  U.S.S.G., App.\n                                             \n\nC.,  Amends.  309 &amp;  389.   For  these reasons,  the district\n\ncourt's consideration  of relevant  conduct  for purposes  of\n\napplying the    2C1.1(b)(1) enhancement entailed no violation\n\nof the Ex Post Facto Clause.\n\n     Affirmed.\n              \n\n                             -4-\n",
