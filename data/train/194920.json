We reject plaintiff's appeal  for the\n                    \n\nfollowing reasons.\n\n          1.  The  district court judge had  discretion under\n\nRule 40.1(i) of the Local Rules of the United States District\n\nCourt for  the District of  Massachusetts to retain  the case\n\nafter remand, and he did not abuse that discretion.\n\n          2.   Plaintiff's complaints about his  counsel were\n\nnot presented below and will  not be considered for the first\n\ntime on appeal.\n\n          3.    Plaintiff's discriminatory  treatment  claims\n\nwere properly dismissed because, as  we warned in our earlier\n\nopinion, Carrera  v. Fair, No.  90-1814, slip op. at  10 (1st\n                         \n\nCir. March 16, 1992), plaintiff did not allege any sufficient\n\nbasis  for supervisory liability.   Plaintiff failed  to cure\n\nthis  pleading omission on  remand.  Plaintiff's  due process\n\nclaim  failed  because plaintiff  did  not  allege sufficient\n\nfacts to show  that the Morris Rules were  applicable to this\n\nparticular   interstate   transfer,   and   the  failure   of\n\nMassachusetts  officials  to  undertake an  investigation  to\n\ndetermine whether plaintiff's request  for transfer had  been\n\ntruly voluntary did  not violate due  process.  The  remanded\n\nclaims   were  properly  dismissed  under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.\n\n12(b)(6).\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -2-\n",
