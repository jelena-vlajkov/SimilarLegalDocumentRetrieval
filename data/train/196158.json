We find no evidence  that petitioner\r\n\nreceived anything other  than a full and impartial hearing in\r\n\nthis  case.  Moreover,  the record supports  the finding that\r\n\npetitioner   exhibited  a   \"pattern   of  serious   criminal\r\n\nmisconduct\"  over a period of  several years, as  well as the\r\n\nfinding  that petitioner failed to meet his burden of showing\r\n\nthat he had been rehabilitated.  \r\n\n     The immigration  judge made specific findings  as to the\r\n\npositive and negative  factors to be considered  in this case\r\n\nand explained  how he reached  his decision.
