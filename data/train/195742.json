On April 14, 1993, appellant Frank A.\r                                \n\nBisegna, a chapter  7 debtor, appealed to the  district court\n\nfrom a bankruptcy  court order determining the  amount of two\n\nclaims  against the estate.   On July 16,  1993, the district\n\ncourt  dismissed the  appeal  for failure  to  file a  brief.\n\nAppellant appeals the district court's order of dismissal.\n\n          We  have reviewed  the record  and discovered  that\n\nappellant  did file a  timely one-page brief  in the district\n\ncourt.   Although this brief  was accepted for  filing by the\n\nclerk's  office,  it was  never entered  on  the docket.   It\n\nappears that the brief was overlooked because it was attached\n\nto copy of the district  court's briefing order.  Ordinarily,\n\nunder  these circumstances,  a remand  might be  appropriate.\n\nHowever, appellant's  one-page  brief, filed  below,  utterly\n\nfailed  to  identify  any  alleged error  in  the  bankruptcy\n\ncourt's ruling on  the claims against  the estate.   Instead,\n\nappellant argued  that the bankruptcy court  erred in denying\n\nhis repeated motions to withdraw his bankruptcy petition.  \n\n          Based on the bankruptcy court docket entries, it is\n\napparent  that appellant  had  already appealed  once to  the\n\ndistrict court from the denial of his motion to withdraw, and\n\nthat  he did not file a timely  appeal from the denial of any\n\nsubsequently  filed  motion  seeking  reconsideration.    See\r                                                                         \n\nBankruptcy Rule 8002.  Under the circumstances, we affirm the\n\njudgment  of dismissal on the  ground that the district court\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nlacked  jurisdiction  to  reach  the  sole  issue  raised  in\n\nappellant's brief.\n\n          Affirmed.\r                               \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
