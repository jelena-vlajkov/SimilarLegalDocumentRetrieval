Berman and Berman &amp; Dowell on brief for appellant.\r\n Geoffrey E. Hobart, Assistant United States Attorney, and\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                      \r\n\n                    February 3, 1999\r\n                                     \r\n                                                                  Per Curiam.  On October 17, 1997, Elias Munoz-Vazquez\r\n(Vazquez) pled guilty in the U.S. District Court for the\r\nDistrict of Massachusetts to a single count of conspiring to\r\ndistribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C.\r\n 841(a)(1) and 846.  He was sentenced on March 5, 1998. \r\nBecause the transaction in question involved more than one\r\nkilogram of a methamphetamine mixture, Vazquez received a ten-\r\nyear mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C.\r\n 841(b)(1)(A)(viii), which he now challenges.  We affirm.\r\n  Vazquez claims, first, that the district court should\r\nhave made an independent finding as to the drug quantity used\r\nto support the imposition of his ten-year mandatory minimum\r\nsentence.  The methamphetamine mixture,   originally in ten\r\npackages weighing approximately one pound each, was seized\r\nduring a buy set up by law enforcement agents posing as drug\r\npurchasers.  After testing, the mixture weighed a total of\r\n3,799.7 grams, or about 3.8 kilograms.  The Sentencing\r\nGuidelines prescribe a base offense level of 34 for offenses\r\ninvolving \"[a]t least 1.5 KG but less than 5 KG of\r\nMethamphetamine.\"  United States Sentencing Commission,\r\nGuidelines Manual,  2D1.1(c)(3) (Nov. 1997).  A base offense\r\nlevel of 34 was therefore appropriate for Vazquez, and he\r\nexpressly agreed to that level in his plea agreement.  In\r\naddition   or, in this case, instead   statutory law requires\r\nimposition of a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence for\r\noffenses involving \"1 kilogram or more of a mixture or\r\nsubstance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine,\r\nits salts, isomers, or salts of its isomers.\"  21 U.S.C.\r\n 841(b)(1)(A)(viii).  Regardless of his base offense level\r\nunder the Guidelines, then, Vazquez faced the ten-year\r\nmandatory minimum, and he expressly acknowledged this both in\r\nhis plea agreement and during his plea colloquy.\r\n   Thus, the exposure that Vazquez acknowledged, both\r\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines and under the drug abuse\r\nprevention and control statutes, was directly in accord with\r\nthe determined weight of the seized methamphetamine mixture. \r\nVazquez never objected to the drug quantity determination per\r\nse, but objected only to the Probation Department's\r\ndetermination of a base offense level of 36 in its Presentence\r\nReport.  Vazquez argued that \"[u]se of the base offense level\r\nof 36 woould [sic] constitute a material breach of the plea\r\nagreement by the Government\" and requested \"specific\r\nperformance of the plea agreement with respect to the setting\r\nof the base offense level herein.\"\r\n   The Probation Department had determined the base\r\noffense level of 36 based on the weight of pure\r\nmethamphetamine found in the seized mixture rather than on the\r\nweight of the mixture itself.  The calculation of the pure\r\nmethamphetamine weight was subject to doubt, however, because\r\nof the manner in which the DEA chemist tested the drugs for\r\npurity.  He first tested all of the one-pound packages and\r\ndetermined that each contained methamphetamine, then mixed the\r\ncontents of all ten packages together to form one pile.  He\r\ntook samples from different parts of the pile, mixed them\r\ntogether, and performed a single purity test.  Testing the\r\npurity and determining the weight of pure methamphetamine in\r\neach of the ten packages would have yielded a more accurate\r\ntotal weight of pure methamphetamine, but this was not done. \r\nSo the government urged in its Sentencing Memorandum that the\r\ndistrict court use only the total weight of the\r\nmethamphetamine mixture to arrive at a base offense level of\r\n34, the level agreed upon in the plea agreement and requested\r\nin Vazquez's Presentence Report objections.  The sentencing\r\njudge did so, observing that \"the proper calculation is the\r\none that the Government has done here on that.\"  Vazquez then\r\nacknowledged that, as to his base offense level objection,\r\n\"the relief requested there has been granted.  So, of course,\r\nthat objection would not need a ruling.\"\r\n   Though he objected simply to the Probation\r\nDepartment's base offense level of 36 and never expressly\r\nchallenged any of the lab results below, Vazquez now wishes to\r\ncall into question the determination as to the weight of the\r\nmethamphetamine mixture, urging that the district court should\r\nhave made an independent finding at an evidentiary hearing. \r\nHowever, we think that his actions at sentencing constitute a\r\nwaiver of his right to make such a challenge.  The agreement\r\nbetween Vazquez and the government on the proper base offense\r\nlevel of 34, his acknowledgment, both in the plea agreement\r\nand before the sentencing judge, that he faced a ten-year\r\nmandatory minimum sentence, and the withdrawal of his\r\nobjection to the Presentence Report's base offense level of 36\r\nonce level 34 was substituted all belie Vazquez's assertions\r\nthat he simply failed to object to   as opposed to\r\naffirmatively waiving   the government's assertions as to drug\r\nquantity or that his objection to the Presentence Report's\r\nbase offense level determination and the government's\r\nconcession regarding inaccurate purity testing put the\r\nmethamphetamine mixture weight into question.  Rather,\r\nVazquez's actions indicate to us the affirmative, albeit\r\nunspoken, acknowledgment that the methamphetamine mixture\r\nweighed at least 1.5 kilograms, the lower threshold for base\r\noffense level 34, and was therefore above the 1 kilogram\r\nthreshold triggering application of the ten-year mandatory\r\nminimum sentence.  Vazquez made an \"'intentional\r\nrelinquishment or abandonment'\" of any right to challenge the\r\nmethamphetamine mixture weight.  United States v. Olano, 507\r\nU.S. 725, 733 (1993) (quoting Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458,\r\n464 (1938)).  See also United States v. Montanez, 82 F.3d 520,\r\n523 (1st Cir. 1996) (holding that failure to request an\r\nevidentiary hearing in the district court \"largely dispose[d]\"\r\nof defendant's claim on appeal that he should have been\r\ngranted one).\r\n   The authorities that Vazquez cites do not help him. \r\nIn United States v. Valencia-Lucena, 988 F.2d 228, 232 (1st\r\nCir. 1993), the court observed that \"[w]hen the quantity of\r\ndrugs used for the base offense level is in dispute, the\r\ndistrict court must make an independent finding at an\r\nevidentiary hearing as to the reliability of the evidence.\" \r\nThe crucial part of this recited rule is the requirement that\r\nthe quantity of drugs used to calculate the base offense level\r\nbe in dispute.  As discussed above, there is no indication in\r\nthis record that the total drug mixture weight was in dispute\r\nat all.  Rather, the defendant successfully argued for a base\r\noffense level that reflected a methamphetamine mixture weight\r\nwholly consistent with a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence. \r\nValencia-Lucena, therefore, does not apply.  A second case\r\nheld that a requested evidentiary hearing should have been\r\ngranted.  See United States v. Jiminez Martinez, 83 F.3d 488,\r\n494 (1st Cir. 1996).  Vazquez made no such request here, and\r\n\"that largely disposes of his claim.\"  United States v.\r\nMontanez, 82 F.3d 520, 523 (1st Cir. 1996).  Jiminez Martinez,\r\nthen, is equally unhelpful.\r\n   Not to be turned away so easily, Vazquez also claims\r\nthat the district court should have applied the \"safety valve\"\r\nprovision in 18 U.S.C.  3553(f), allowing him to escape the\r\nmandatory minimum sentence.  We may dispose of this contention\r\nmore easily than we have the first.  Section 5C1.2 of the\r\nSentencing Guidelines sets forth verbatim five criteria from\r\n18 U.S.C.  3553(f) that must be met before the sentencing\r\ncourt may grant relief from an otherwise applicable mandatory\r\nminimum sentence.  The only criterion still at issue at\r\nsentencing was the requirement that \"not later than the time\r\nof the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully\r\nprovided to the Government all information or evidence the\r\ndefendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were\r\npart of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or\r\nplan.\"  18 U.S.C.  3553(f)(5); USSG  5C1.2(5).\r\n   Though Vazquez argued in his objections to the\r\nPresentence Report that he had \"fully revealed all facts known\r\nby him relevant to his conduct\" and was therefore entitled to\r\napplication of the safety valve, he acknowledged at sentencing\r\nthat he had not, in fact, fulfilled the requirement.  The\r\nlawyer for Vazquez's codefendant first made it clear that a\r\nproffer had been made but was insufficient:  \"I would like to\r\nadvise the Court that, after debriefing with the Government,\r\nthe Government is not satisfied that we have met the burden\r\nunder 5C1.2 and, at this point, I would have to concur.\" \r\nVazquez's lawyer echoed these sentiments:  \"as with Mr.\r\nBautista, the proffer that was required was not made and we\r\nconcur in that.\"  Thus, Vazquez admitted he had not met the\r\nrequirements of USSG  5C1.2, thereby waiving his right to a\r\ncourt finding that he did.\r\n   Vazquez argues that, because he indicated in his\r\nobjections to the Presentence Report his position that he was\r\nentitled to application of the safety valve, the district\r\ncourt should have ignored trial counsel's admission that the\r\ncondition was not met and \"inquired further into the\r\ncircumstances of the proffer and determined whether any\r\npossibility existed for application of the safety valve.\" \r\nThis is not the law.  The admission at sentencing was an\r\n\"intentional relinquishment or abandonment\" of the right to a\r\ncourt finding on whether Vazquez had satisfied the safety\r\nvalve criteria.  The district court no longer had any reason\r\nor responsibility to make such a determination.\r\n   We may dispose of Vazquez's third contention with even\r\ngreater ease.  He claims that the district court should have\r\ndeparted downward under the Sentencing Guidelines based on his\r\nexceptional acceptance of responsibility and minimal\r\ninvolvement in the drug transaction at issue.  Whether such a\r\ndeparture from the sentencing range would have been\r\nappropriate is irrelevant since Vazquez in any event faced a\r\nten-year mandatory minimum sentence.\r\n   Affirmed.\r\n",
