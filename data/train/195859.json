Gen.\n\nLaws     42-116-40  (1993)  (the  Depco  Act)  on  constitutional\n\ngrounds.

BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          In  January  1991,  Bruce  Sundlun,  newly  inaugurated\n\nGovernor  of   Rhode  Island,  proclaimed  a   banking  emergency\n\nprecipitated by  the  collapse  of  the Rhode  Island  Share  and\n\nDeposit Indemnity Corporation  (RISDIC), a firm that  had insured\n\ndeposits  at  no  fewer  than  45  Rhode  Island-based  financial\n\ninstitutions.1    Since  those  institutions  could  not  operate\n\nlegally without deposit insurance, see R.I.  Gen. Laws   19-11-9,\r                                                \n\nthe Governor closed them.\n\n          The  lockout provoked  a  financial crisis,  preventing\n\ndepositors from withdrawing their funds and causing consternation\n\nin a  myriad of  other ways.   Over  time, many  of the  affected\n\ninstitutions  obtained insurance from sources such as the Federal\n\nDeposit  Insurance Corporation,  and resumed operations.   Others\n\nwere  absorbed by  insured entities.   In  the end  ten financial\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     1The  Rhode Island General Assembly chartered RISDIC in 1969\nas  a private deposit-insurance corporation.  It began operations\nin   1971,  subject  only  to  state,  not  federal,  regulation.\nDepositors tended to view RISDIC as a state-sponsored enterprise,\nand its proprietors   the banks and credit unions that dealt with\nit   did nothing to dispel this misconception.\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n institutions were unable to reopen.  These financial institutions\n\nhad something  in common:   each of them had  followed uncommonly\n\nadventurous  lending practices, and  had become insolvent.   They\n\nwere all placed into conservatorship.   The Rhode Island  General\n\nAssembly  created a public  corporation, the  Depositors Economic\n\nProtection  Corporation (Depco), to  act as the  receiver, manage\n\nthe  failed banks' estates,  marshal and liquidate  their assets,\n\nrepay  depositors, and seek  recovery from those  responsible for\n\nthe  fiasco.2   In addition,  Depco  served as  the receiver  for\n\nRISDIC.\n\n          A special  state commission charged  with investigating\n\nthe  banking  crisis  found  no  shortage  of  miscreants.    The\n\ncommission assigned  blame, inter  alia, to  former officers  and\r                                                 \n\ndirectors  of the  failed institutions, certain  large borrowers,\n\nthe  state  Department  of   Business  Regulation,  the   General\n\nAssembly, and a former governor.  The commission reserved some of\n\nits  most stinging  criticism for  RISDIC and  those persons  who\n\noccupied  prominent positions  in  the  RISDIC  hierarchy.    The\n\ncommission  included E&amp;Y, which  had provided accounting services\n\nto RISDIC  and to  many of  its  insureds, as  among the  parties\n\ndeserving special opprobrium.\n\n          The  banks'  collapse  proved   to  be  a   depositor's\n\nnightmare but  a lawyer's dream, spawning a plethora of lawsuits.\n\nFor  the  most part,  the depositors'  and creditors'  suits were\n                    \r                              \n\n     2As of  the time the  parties' briefs were filed,  Depco had\nmanaged to repay  93% of the affected depositors and to repay 90%\nor more of the amounts owed to the remaining depositors.\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n consolidated  in a  series  of master  complaints  (one for  each\n\nfailed institution) docketed in the state superior court.   Then,\n\nin early 1992, Depco and other plaintiffs filed a civil action in\n\nsuperior court against E&amp;Y and  sundry other defendants.  In that\n\nsuit, the plaintiffs charged E&amp;Y with negligence and professional\n\nmalpractice.  Among  other things, they  alleged that E&amp;Y  issued\n\nunqualified  (or  insufficiently  qualified)  audit  opinions  to\n\nRISDIC  and  a  number  of  RISDIC-insured  institutions  despite\n\nobvious patterns  of pervasive  lending irregularities  and other\n\nclear portents of impending financial disaster.\n\n          In July of 1993, the General Assembly revised state law\n\nas  it pertained  to the RISDIC  cases by passing  the Depco Act,\n\nPub.  L.  1993,  ch.  85.   The  Act  provides  that  potentially\n\nresponsible parties who in good faith achieve judicially approved\n\nsettlements with Depco  will not  be liable  for contribution  to\n\nother  joint tortfeasors;  and  that,  if  a  putative  defendant\n\nsettles  with Depco  on this  basis, the  potential liability  of\n\nother joint tortfeasors will be reduced only by the dollar amount\n\nof the settlement, not by the settling party's  pro rata share of\n\nthe aggregate liability.3\n                    \r                              \n\n     3The statute reads in relevant part:\n\n          Notwithstanding any provisions of  law to the\n          contrary,  a  person, corporation,  or  other\n          entity who has resolved its liability to  the\n          Rhode Island Depositors'  Economic Protection\n          Corporation,  the  receiver of  Rhode  Island\n          Share  and Deposit  Indemnity Corporation  or\n          the receiver of any state-chartered financial\n          institution in judicially-approved good faith\n          settlement shall not be liable for claims for\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n           The  Act  transmogrifies  the law  of  contribution for\n\npurposes  of the  RISDIC cases.   Prior  to its  passage, a  non-\n\nsettling  defendant in  a negligence  action    including  a non-\n\nsettling defendant  in a  RISDIC case    could, if  found liable,\n\nseek contribution according to proportionate fault from all other\n\njoint  tortfeasors, save only  those who had  entered settlements\n\nthat explicitly  released  all  claims  against  all  potentially\n\nresponsible parties  for the settling  tortfeasor's proportionate\n\nshare  of the overall liability.   See R.I.  Gen. Laws    10-6-7,\r                                                \n\n10-6-8, 10-6-11 (1993).  In  other words, prior law ensured that,\n\nif a joint  tortfeasor were held responsible for  (and paid) more\n\nthan its  ratable share  of damages,  it could seek  contribution\n\nfrom other joint tortfeasors who had carried less than their fair\n\nshare of the load.  Under the Depco Act, however,  a non-settling\n\ntortfeasor can be held liable for more than its pro rata share of\n\ndamages, yet find that it  has no remaining right of contribution\n\nas to some (or, conceivably, all) of the overage paid.\n\n          E&amp;Y  did not  go  quietly  into this  dark  night.   It\n                    \r                              \n\n          contribution or equitable indemnity regarding\n          matters addressed  in the  settlement.   Such\n          settlement  does  not   discharge  any  other\n          tortfeasors unless its terms  so provide, but\n          it reduces  the potential  liability of  such\n          joint  tortfeasors  by   the  amount  of  the\n          settlement.\n\nR.I.  Gen. Laws   42-116-40 (1993).   The idea behind the statute\nis scarcely  original; the  Depco Act is  modeled on  the special\ncontribution   provisions   contained    in   the   Comprehensive\nEnvironmental Response Compensation &amp; Liability Act (CERCLA), see\r                                                                           \n42  U.S.C.   9613(f)(2) -  (3) (1988); see  also United States v.\r                                                                        \nCannons  Eng'g  Corp.,  899  F.2d   79,  91-92  (1st  Cir.  1990)\r                               \n(explaining operation of CERCLA contribution provisions).\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n promptly  sued  in   the  federal  district  court,4   seeking  a\n\ndeclaration that  the Depco Act,  on its  face and as  applied to\n\nE&amp;Y, transgresses  the Federal  Constitution.   Specifically, E&amp;Y\n\nurged the court to find that the Act violates the due process and\n\nequal protection  clauses, and  that it  constitutes an  unlawful\n\nbill of attainder.\n\n          In  its   complaint,  E&amp;Y  makes   various  allegations\n\ndesigned  to highlight  the ostensible  unfairness  of the  legal\n\npredicament  it now  faces.    Stripped  of  animadversions,  the\n\ncomplaint brands the Depco Act as special legislation drafted for\n\nthe  specific purpose of depriving E&amp;Y of preexisting substantive\n\nrights in order  to intimidate E&amp;Y and thereby  force a lucrative\n\nsettlement  of Depco's negligence action.5  Depco's strategy, E&amp;Y\n\nalleges,  is to  reach early  settlements  with most  potentially\n\nresponsible  parties,  limited   to  the  face  value   of  their\n\nrespective  liability insurance policies,  but to treat  E&amp;Y as a\n\n\"deep pocket\" from whom a huge settlement can be extracted.   E&amp;Y\n\nasserts  that  the  doubts  surrounding  the  viability  of  this\n\nstrategy,  and particularly the  profound uncertainties about the\n\nAct's  constitutionality, are  currently  imposing a  substantial\n\nhardship  on E&amp;Y  in at  least two  ways.   First, the  situation\n                    \r                              \n\n     4E&amp;Y's complaint named Governor Sundlun, Depco,  and Depco's\nexecutive  director as  defendants.   For  simplicity's sake,  we\nrefer to the defendants, collectively, as \"Depco.\"\n\n     5E&amp;Y  adds various details  designed to bolster  this claim,\nincluding  a charge that Depco's specially retained trial counsel\nlobbied for passage of the Act, telling legislators that changing\nthe  law  of  contribution  greatly  improved Depco's  bargaining\nposition vis-a-vis E&amp;Y.\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n creates  coercive pressure  on E&amp;Y  to settle  the pending  state\n\ncourt suit.  Second, it deprives E&amp;Y of the ability adequately to\n\nappraise its potential exposure.\n\n          The  defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for want\n\nof subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that the case lacked\n\nripeness,6  and,   as  a  back-up,   invoked  several  abstention\n\ntheories.  The district court referred the motion to a magistrate\n\njudge,  see Fed.  R.  Civ.  P. 72(b),  who  recommended that  the\r                     \n\ncomplaint be dismissed  for want of subject  matter jurisdiction,\n\nor, alternatively,  in the  exercise of  the court's  discretion.\n\nE&amp;Y objected to the magistrate's report.  On de  novo review, the\r                                                               \n\ndistrict   court  characterized  the   complaint  as  unripe  and\n\ndismissed it under Rule 12(b)(1).  See E&amp;Y v. Depco, 862 F. Supp.\r                                                             \n\n709 (D.R.I.  1994).   Judge Boyle stressed  that since  E&amp;Y would\n\nonly be damaged by the Depco Act if a series of contingent events\n\noccurred in the  future, it failed satisfactorily  to demonstrate\n\nthat \"it has sustained or  is immediately in danger of sustaining\n\na direct injury.\"   Id. at 714-15.  The judge went on  to observe\r                                 \n\nthat, were  the case ripe,  comity and federalism  concerns would\n\nnonetheless prompt  him to abstain.7   See id. at  715-16 (citing\r                                                        \n                    \r                              \n\n     6On appeal, Depco advances the closely related argument that\nE&amp;Y lacks  standing.   Despite their  natural imbrication,  these\nasseverations  are distinct; the  standing doctrine  is concerned\nwith who may bring a particular suit, while the ripeness doctrine\nis concerned  with when a party may bring  suit.  Because we hold\nthat the controversy is not  ripe, we eschew any consideration of\nwhether E&amp;Y also lacks standing.\n\n     7Judge Boyle also expressed his  view that the Depco Act did\nnot comprise a bill of attainder.   See E&amp;Y, 862 F. Supp. at 716-\r                                                     \n17.

STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\n          A district court's determination  that it lacks subject\n\nmatter  jurisdiction  because  the  case before  it  is  not ripe\n\nusually  presents a  question of  law reviewable  de novo  in the\r                                                                   \n\ncourt of  appeals.

THE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACT\r          III.  THE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACT\n\n          The Declaratory  Judgment Act,  28 U.S.C.     2201-2202\n\n(1988), empowers a federal court to grant declaratory relief in a\n\ncase  of actual  controversy.   The  Act does  not itself  confer\n\nsubject matter  jurisdiction,  but, rather,  makes  available  an\n\nadded anodyne for disputes that  come within the federal  courts'\n\njurisdiction  on some  other basis.    See Franchise  Tax Bd.  v.\r                                                                       \n\nConstruction Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 15-16 (1983).\r                                              \n\n          The   Declaratory  Judgment   Act  serves   a  valuable\n\npurpose.8   It is designed  to enable litigants to  clarify legal\n\nrights and  obligations before acting upon them.   See Step-Saver\r                                                                           \n\nData  Sys., Inc. v.

Because the  Act offers  a\n\nwindow of opportunity, not a guarantee of access, the courts, not\n\nthe  litigants,   ultimately  must  determine   when  declaratory\n\njudgments are appropriate and  when they are not.

It  is not necessary to harvest  this jurisprudence today.\n\nFor present  purposes, it  suffices to sound  a note  of caution:\n\nthe discretion  to grant  declaratory relief  is to be  exercised\n\nwith  great  circumspection  when matters  of  public  moment are\n\ninvolved, see Washington Pub.

Examining The Ossature.\r                                                       \n\n          In  its seminal  opinion  on  the  application  of  the\n\nripeness  doctrine  in  the  declaratory  judgment  context,  the\n\nSupreme Court explained that the doctrine's basic rationale is to\n\n                                10\r\r\n\n \"prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication,\n\nfrom entangling  themselves in  abstract disagreements.\"   Abbott\r                                                                           \n\nLabs v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49 (1967).  While the doctrine\r                         \n\nhas a prudential  flavor, a test for ripeness is also mandated by\n\nthe constitutional requirement that federal jurisdiction  extends\n\nonly to actual cases or  controversies, see U.S. Const. art. III,\r                                                     \n\n  2; see also Wycoff, 344 U.S. at 242-45.  Consequently, although\r                              \n\na court may,  within stated limits, dismiss  declaratory judgment\n\nactions  in its  discretion, a  court has  no alternative  but to\n\ndismiss an unripe action.\n\n          Questions of ripeness that arise incident to challenged\n\ngovernmental actions  in  the declaratory  judgment  context  are\n\ngauged by means of a two-part test.  See Abbott Labs, 387 U.S. at\r                                                              \n\n149.  First, the court  must consider whether the issue presented\n\nis fit for  review.  This branch  of the test  typically involves\n\nsubsidiary  queries concerning  finality,  definiteness, and  the\n\nextent to  which resolution of  the challenge depends  upon facts\n\nthat  may not  yet be  sufficiently developed.   See,  e.g., W.R.\r                                                                           \n\nGrace  &amp; Co.  v. EPA,  959 F.2d  360, 364 (1st  Cir. 1992).   The\r                              \n\nsecond  branch of  the Abbott  Labs  test requires  the court  to\r                                             \n\nconsider the  extent to  which hardship looms    an  inquiry that\n\ntypically \"turns  upon whether  the challenged  action creates  a\n\n`direct and immediate' dilemma  for the parties.\"  Id.

Though\n\n                                11\r\r\n\n some commentators have suggested that  either of the two showings\n\nmay suffice  to allay ripeness  concerns, see, e.g.,  Laurence H.\r                                                             \n\nTribe, American Constitutional  Law   3-10, at 80  (2d ed. 1987),\r                                             \n\nthe predominant weight  of authority supports the  opposite view,\n\nsee, e.g.,  Poe v. Ullman,  367 U.S. 497, 509  (1961) (dismissing\r                                   \n\nfor lack of  ripeness despite the  predominantly legal nature  of\n\nthe  question presented  and the  minimal  need for  an extensive\n\nfactual record); Cedars-Sinai  Medical Ctr., v. Watkins,  11 F.3d\r                                                                 \n\n1573, 1581 (Fed.

In line with the majority view, we\n\nhold that both prongs of the test ordinarily must be satisfied in\n\norder  to  establish  ripeness.    In  so  holding,  however,  we\n\nacknowledge  the  possibility  that there  may  be  some sort  of\n\nsliding scale  under which,  say, a very  powerful exhibition  of\n\nimmediate hardship  might  compensate  for  questionable  fitness\n\n(such  as a  degree of imprecision  in the  factual circumstances\n\nsurrounding the case), or vice versa.9\n\n          We  end this  segment  of our  opinion  on yet  another\n\ncautionary  note.   The ripeness  inquiry is  often  sui generis.\r                                                                          \n\nMost  litigation has  idiosyncratic  features,  and  the  various\n\nintegers  that enter  into the  ripeness equation play  out quite\n\ndifferently from case to case, thus  influencing the bottom line.\n                    \r                              \n\n     9We need not probe this final point,  for E&amp;Y has not made a\nsufficiently  strong showing  under  either  of  the  test's  two\nprongs.

In general,  the greater the hardship, the more\n\napt a court  will be to find  ripeness.  See, e.g.,  Pacific Gas,\r                                                                          \n\n461  U.S.  at 201  &amp;  n.13.   Though the  hallmark  of cognizable\n\nhardship is  usually direct  and immediate  harm, other  kinds of\n\ninjuries occasionally may suffice.  For example, if the operation\n\nof a challenged  statute is inevitable, ripeness  is not defeated\n\nby the existence of a time delay before the statute takes effect.\n\nSee Regional  Rail Reorganization  Act Cases,  419 U.S. 102,  143\r                                                      \n\n(1974).   And, moreover,  even when the  direct application  of a\n\nstatute is  to some degree  remote or contingent,  its collateral\n\neffects may inflict  present injuries that, though  indirect, are\n\nadequate to support a finding of ripeness.\n\n          Thus,  in  Duke  Power, the  plaintiffs,  some  of whom\r                                          \n\n                                14\r\r\n\n resided near  a nuclear power  plant, sought a declaration  as to\n\nthe  unconstitutionality of the  Price-Anderson Act (which  set a\n\nmonetary cap  on damages  recoverable in  consequence of  nuclear\n\naccidents).  Even  though the Court thought the  possibility of a\n\nnuclear  accident   speculative,   it   nonetheless   found   the\n\ncontroversy ripe.   The Justices reasoned  that the statute  made\n\nfeasible the  construction of  the plant, which,  in turn,  posed\n\nrisks (such  as fear of  an accident, exposure to  radiation, and\n\nthermal pollution)  that would  not  otherwise exist.   See  Duke\r                                                                           \n\nPower, 438 U.S. at 81.  In the Court's view, these  injuries were\r               \n\nsufficient  to support a finding of  ripeness.  See id. at 81-82;\r                                                                 \n\nsee also  McCoy-Elkhorn Coal Corp.  v.

There,  the  Court determined  that  a  group  of\n\nutilities could  challenge a state  law imposing a  moratorium on\n\nthe construction of  nuclear power plants.  See  Pacific Gas, 461\r                                                                      \n\nU.S. at 197-200.   Noting the long lead time and  the millions of\n\ndollars  that  had  to  be  expended simply  to  proceed  to  the\n\nlicensing  stage in  the  course of  developing  a nuclear  power\n\nplant,  see  id.  at  201  n.13, the  Court  envisioned  enormous\r                          \n\nhardship were it  to require the  industry to chart  a course  of\n\naction without knowing whether the moratorium was valid.\n\n                                15\r\r\n\n           Once  again, we  end with  watchful words.   A  court's\n\nassessment of  hardship need not  be phrased  solely in  negative\n\nterms.  The key question involves the usefulness of a declaratory\n\njudgment,  that is, the  extent to which  the desired declaration\n\n\"would  be  of  practical assistance  in  setting  the underlying\n\ncontroversy  to  rest.\"   Narragansett  Tribe,  19  F.3d at  693.\r                                                       \n\nHence, courts should not become mired in the frequently sophistic\n\ndistinction  as  to  whether  refusing  declaratory  relief  will\n\nactually impose a hardship or merely fail to confer a benefit.\n\n                      C.

First,  the  claims are  not  now fit  for federal\n\njudicial review.10   Second, postponing an adjudication  will not\n\nwork a substantial hardship.\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     10State judicial review is, however, in the offing.  Shortly\nbefore  we heard  oral argument,  Depco asked the  state superior\ncourt to  certify questions  anent the  constitutionality of  the\nDepco Act to the state supreme court.  Depco made the motion in a\ntort case  it had commenced  involving the collapse of  the Brown\nUniversity Employees Credit  Union, a RISDIC-insured institution.\nOver E&amp;Y's objection   E&amp;Y is a third-party defendant in the suit\n  the superior  court granted Depco's motion.   The state supreme\ncourt  received the  certified  questions,  paired  them  with  a\nstrikingly similar  set of  constitutional issues  limned by  the\nGovernor in a  pending request for an advisory  opinion, see R.I.\r                                                                      \nConst.  art. X,    3  (authorizing the  governor to  request such\nadvisory  opinions from the state supreme court), and promulgated\na   consolidated  briefing  schedule.    Although  E&amp;Y  correctly\nmaintains that announcing  a briefing schedule is  not tantamount\nto reaching  the merits  of the  certified questions, it  appears\nlikely that  the Rhode Island  Supreme Court will soon  hear oral\narguments.\n\n                                16\r\r\n\n           1.  Fitness.   On the fitness prong, E&amp;Y points  to the\r                    1.  Fitness.\r                               \r          fact that its complaint challenges the Depco Act both on its face\nand   as  applied.     The   former  claim,   it  tells   us,  is\n\nquintessentially legal  in nature, and,  therefore, suitable  for\n\nimmediate judicial review.   See, e.g., Pacific Gas,  461 U.S. at\r                                                             \n\n201; Duke Power, 438 U.S. at 81-82.  We believe that this is  too\r                         \n\nsimplistic  a  view,  for  it focuses  narrowly  on  the  claim's\n\nsusceptibility to resolution and turns a blind eye to the related\n\n   but equally important    matter of whether judicial resolution\n\nis appropriate here and now.\n\n          The notion  that disputes  which turn  on purely  legal\n\nquestions are always  ripe for judicial review  is a myth.   Even\n\nwhen the \"legal\" emphasis of  a particular claim is sufficient to\n\nmask  gaps in  the factual  record,  a court  will find  ripeness\n\nlacking  if  the anticipated  events  and injury  are  simply too\n\nremote to  justify contemporaneous  adjudication.   See Hodel  v.\r                                                                       \n\nVirginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclam.

Put bluntly, the question\n\nof fitness does not pivot solely on whether a court is capable of\n\nresolving  a claim intelligently, but also involves an assessment\n\nof whether it is appropriate for the court to undertake the task.\n\nFederal  courts cannot    and  should  not    spend their  scarce\n\nresources  in  what  amounts  to  shadow  boxing.    Thus,  if  a\n\nplaintiff's  claim,  though  predominantly  legal  in  character,\n\ndepends upon future events that  may never come to pass, or  that\n\nmay not occur in  the form forecasted, then the  claim is unripe.\n\nSee Mass.

For\n\nthis reason, the mere  fact that E&amp;Y  asserts a challenge to  the\n\nDepco Act on its face, without more, cannot carry the day.\n\n          Here, there is very little more:  E&amp;Y's claim lacks the\n\nneeded dimensions of immediacy and reality.  The challenge is not\n\nrooted  in  the  present,  but  depends on  a  lengthy  chain  of\n\nspeculation as  to what the  future has  in store.   Tracing  the\n\nlinks in this  chain demonstrates their fragility.   In order for\n\nE&amp;Y to  be harmed by the  operation of the statute,  these events\n\nmust come to pass:  (1) at least one person, firm, or corporation\n\nother than E&amp;Y  must admit  fault, or  be found to  have been  at\n\nfault,  and must have  caused recoverable damages  arising out of\n\nthe  banking crisis;11  (2)  that other  party  must settle  with\n\nDepco; (3) the settlement  must be entered into in good faith and\n\napproved by a competent court; (4) under the bargained terms, the\n\nsettlor  must pay  less  than  its pro  rata  share, measured  by\n\nrelative fault; (5) perhaps most critically, E&amp;Y   which, to this\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     11Depco  apparently  has  reached  one  settlement  that  is\nexpressly conditioned on  the constitutionality of the  Depco Act\nbeing upheld by  the Rhode Island Supreme Court.   See supra note\r                                                                      \n10.   In the settlement  papers the settling  defendants disclaim\nany  wrongdoing,  and Depco  agrees  not  to  treat the  fact  of\nsettlement as  an admission  of liability.   The more  widespread\nthis pattern of  settlement becomes, the more arduous  it will be\nto fulfill the \"other tortfeasor\" requirement.\n\n                                18\r\r\n\n date, has steadfastly denied fault    must be found to  have been\n\nnegligent, and  its negligence  must be found  to have  caused or\n\ncontributed to the damages; (6)  Depco must attempt to collect an\n\namount greater than  E&amp;Y's pro rata share  of the damages;  (7) a\n\ncourt must find  E&amp;Y liable for, and order it to pay, the tribute\n\ndemanded; and  (8) E&amp;Y  must then seek  contribution from  one or\n\nmore of  the \"underpaying\"  joint  tortfeasors (who,  presumably,\n\nwill interpose the  statute as a defense).  This is a long string\n\nof contingencies    so long  that E&amp;Y's assertion of  fitness for\n\njudicial review trips over it and falls.\n\n          Courts should always be hesitant to answer hypothetical\n\nquestions.  See  Poe, 367 U.S.  at 503.  That hesitancy does  not\r                              \n\nevaporate  merely  because  a  suit  is couched  as  a  plea  for\n\ndeclaratory relief.   See, e.g., Aetna Life Ins.  Co. v. Haworth,\r                                                                          \n\n300 U.S. 227, 240-41 (1937) (explaining that courts, in the guise\n\nof declaratory judgment, should not issue opinions \"advising what\n\nthe  law would  be upon  a  hypothetical state  of facts\").   The\n\nmanifold  uncertainties  that  attend this  case  in  its present\n\nposture  bring to  mind this  principle:   even though  the legal\n\nquestion presented by E&amp;Y's facial  challenge to the Depco Act is\n\nnot  likely to  be placed  in  sharper focus  by further  factual\n\ndevelopment, the claim is unripe  because any application of  the\n\nchallenged  statute to E&amp;Y  depends on serendipitous  events that\n\nmay not occur as anticipated   or may not occur at all.  The case\n\nthat E&amp;Y argues is, at this stage, largely hypothetical, and such\n\ncases are  seldom fit for  federal judicial review.   Cf. William\r                                                                   \n\n                                19\r\r\n\n Shakespeare,  Macbeth,  act   I,  sc.  iii,  ll.   133-34  (1605)\r                               \n\n(reminding  readers that  \"present fears  are  [often] less  than\n\nhorrible imaginings\").\n\n          This  recital does not  come close to  exhausting E&amp;Y's\n\nproblems on the  fitness prong of the Abbott Labs test.  Over and\r                                                           \n\nbeyond   the  potential   waste   of  judicial   resources   that\n\nentertaining a remote and speculative claim would risk, there are\n\nother telltale signs  that a finding of fitness  is not warranted\n\nhere.  We mention two such indicators.\n\n          The first telltale  has a prudential cast.   Were we to\n\npermit E&amp;Y's  action to be  decided now, we  would be  setting in\n\nmotion  a constitutional adjudication that  not only could have a\n\nthunderous impact  on important  state interests  but that  might\n\nwell prove to be completely  unnecessary (if, say, E&amp;Y were later\n\nfound to have exercised due care,  or if the parties settled  for\n\nan  amount  that did  not  exceed  E&amp;Y's pro  rata  share  of the\n\nrecoverable damages).   Courts should strive to  avoid gratuitous\n\njourneys through forbidding constitutional terrain.  See Poe, 367\r                                                                      \n\nU.S.  at 502-04; see  also El Dia,  963 F.2d  at 494 (counselling\r                                           \n\nthat  \"[u]ncertain  questions  of  constitutional  law  should be\n\naddressed only when absolutely necessary\").\n\n          A second disincentive  to a finding of  fitness relates\n\nto  the  absence   of  other  parties  having  a   stake  in  the\n\ncontroversy.    E&amp;Y  has  sued  a  stage  agency  and  two  state\n\nofficials.  See supra note 4.   While we do not doubt that  these\r                               \n\nparties will defend the Act's constitutionality, E&amp;Y's suit lacks\n\n                                20\r\r\n\n full adverseness.   See generally Narragansett Tribe,  19 F.3d at\r                                                              \n\n692-93  (discussing  adverseness  requirement).12    We   explain\n\nbriefly.\n\n          The real parties  in interest are presumably  the other\n\njoint  tortfeasors  (if  any  there  be).    After  all,  because\n\ntortfeasors are jointly  and severally liable under  Rhode Island\n\nlaw,  Depco can  collect the  total  amount of  damages from  E&amp;Y\n\nregardless  of  what  regime   governs  tortfeasors'  rights   of\n\ncontribution.  Thus, Depco's only  interest in the Act relates to\n\nits efficacy as a negotiating tool.\n\n          It follows that,  if E&amp;Y is harmed at  all, the parties\n\nmost directly  adverse to  it will  be underpaying tortfeasors   \n\nthose who settle for less than their proportionate shares and who\n\nwould, without the prophylaxis  of the Depco Act, face  liability\n\nto overpaying tortfeasors for contribution.  These persons cannot\n\nbe made parties to this litigation now because there is no way of\n\npredicting at this early date who they will  be   or even if they\n\nwill exist.   Hence, E&amp;Y's action,  under current conditions,  is\n\nincompletely  adverse.   This  is  a  serious indictment,  for  a\n\nlawsuit that is hobbed in this  manner is much less likely to  be\n                    \r                              \n\n     12E&amp;Y touts  Narragansett Tribe,  a case  in which  we found\r                                              \ndisputed  issues ripe, as  directly applicable precedent.   We do\nnot agree.  There,  unlike in this  case, the state's suit  fully\nsatisfied the  adverseness requirement.

Other  distinctions  abound; the  arguably\nunripe issues in  that case were  not of constitutional  stature,\nthe  public interest  favored immediate adjudication,  comity was\nnot  a problem  (as,  there,  unlike here,  the  state urged  the\nfederal court to proceed), the hardship that would flow from non-\nadjudication was  starkly apparent, and  the utility of  a prompt\ndecision was more easily discernible.\n\n                                21\r\r\n\n ripe for judicial  review.13  See Connecticut Mut.

Co., 635  A.2d 1181,\r                                                          \n1186-87 (R.I. 1994) (similar; elucidating Rhode Island law).\n\n     14We   have   discussed   only  E&amp;Y's   challenge   to   the\nconstitutionality  of the Depco  Act on its face.   To go further\nwould be supererogatory.   Because the facial challenge  is unfit\nfor review, it follows a fortiori that the \"as applied\" challenge\r                                           \nto a  freshly minted  statute that  has yet  to  make its  maiden\nvoyage is also unfit.\n\n                                22\r\r\n\n These harms are indirect.   And although it is true  that present\n\nindirect  effects occasionally may wreak a sufficient hardship to\n\nsupport a finding  of ripeness, see, e.g., Pacific  Gas, 461 U.S.\r                                                                 \n\nat 201, the effects of which E&amp;Y complains are not so pernicious.\n\nThere  is  quite  a difference  between  increasing  the  risk of\n\nexposure  to  radiation,  Duke  Power,  438 U.S.  at  81-82,  and\r                                               \n\nincreasing the difficulty of evaluating a money damages claim for\n\nsettlement purposes.\n\n          The uncertainty  of which  E&amp;Y complains  in this  case\n\narises in  the context of  bilateral negotiations, not  yet under\n\nway, in  which opposing parties  will explore the  possibility of\n\nsettling  a  hotly disputed  case  based partly  on  the expected\n\nresults of  the litigation.   That situation  presents a  type of\n\nhardship  that is qualitatively different than those displayed in\n\nPacific Gas  and Duke Power,  for resolving the challenge  to the\r                                     \n\nDepco Act will help the  challenger only marginally.  Either way,\n\nE&amp;Y still will  be faced with the incubus  of pending litigation.\n\nEither way,  E&amp;Y still will  have to make an  evaluative judgment\n\nanent  the  desirability  of  settlement on  various  terms     a\n\njudgment that  depends on  many factors other  than its  right to\n\ncontribution (and, accordingly,  on many factors that will not be\n\nclarified  by  an  immediate   determination  of  the   statute's\n\nconstitutionality).  The usefulness that may satisfy the hardship\n\nprong of Abbott Labs  is not met by a  party showing that it  has\r                              \n\nthe opportunity to move from a position of utter confusion to one\n\nof mere befuddlement.\n\n                                23\r\r\n\n           This is  not to  deny that  a declaratory  decree might\n\nhave  some utility.   If  the  declaratory action  proceeds to  a\n\nconclusion,  the parties  will  obtain  an  additional  piece  of\n\ninformation  that  will  help  them  to  determine  a  settlement\n\nstrategy.  The  point, however, is that  E&amp;Y   though it  will be\n\nbetter informed   still  will not be spared the need  to make the\n\nvery sort of evaluative  judgment that it tells us it is striving\n\nto avoid.   What  is more,  E&amp;Y still  will not  control its  own\n\ndestiny in respect to settlement,  for Depco might (or might not)\n\nbe willing to settle on  E&amp;Y's terms, and other tortfeasors might\n\n(or  might not)  leave themselves  open  to contribution  claims,\n\nregardless of whether the declaratory judgment action proceeds.\n\n          The limited utility of the judgment that E&amp;Y seeks here\n\nis  highlighted  by the  fact  that the  \"value\"  of  a case  for\n\nsettlement purposes is always  a moving target.   Phrased another\n\nway, settlement  value  is at  best  an estimate,  subjective  in\n\nnature, reflecting  the worth  that the  parties themselves,  for\n\nmyriad reasons,  attach to  their case.   See Mathewson  Corp. v.\r                                                                        \n\nAllied Marine  Indus., Inc., 827  F.2d 850, 855 (1st  Cir. 1987).\r                                     \n\nIt follows inexorably that the settlement value of  Depco's claim\n\nagainst E&amp;Y will not be determined  by the incidence of rights of\n\ncontribution  alone.  See  generally Note, Private  Settlement as\r                                                                           \n\nAlternative Adjudication:  A Rationale for Negotiation Ethics, 18\r                                                                       \n\nU.

Rather, a  claim of hardship  demands an\n\nassessment  of the  complainant's  position in  light of  all the\n\nattendant circumstances.   See State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co. v.\r                                                                        \n\nDole, 802 F.2d 474, 479 (D.C.

On one  hand, the  uncertainty admittedly\ngenerates pressure on  E&amp;Y to pay more by way of settlement.  But\non the  other  hand, the  uncertainty  also encourages  Depco  to\nsettle for  less  than it  would  demand if  it  knew beyond  any\nperadventure of doubt that the Act would withstand constitutional\nscrutiny.  By the same  token, a resolution of the constitutional\nquestion would cut both ways.  If  a court upholds the Depco Act,\nE&amp;Y probably will be faced with the prospect of paying more for a\nrelease,  whereas, if a  court invalidates the  Act, E&amp;Y probably\nwill  be able to pay less.  This shifting array of possibilities,\ntilting first  in one  direction and then  in the  other, further\ndilutes E&amp;Y's claim of an intolerable hardship.\n\n                                25\r\r\n\n circumstances).   Here,  three facts  soften the  sharp edges  of\n\nE&amp;Y's professed hardship, and, therefore, counsel restraint.\n\n          First,  the  contingent  nature   of  E&amp;Y's  claim  has\n\nimplications  for  hardship  as  well  for  fitness.   Given  the\n\nstretched chain of events that  must transpire before the Act can\n\nharm E&amp;Y, and the speculative nature of many of those events,  we\n\nremain  unconvinced either  that E&amp;Y's  ability  to negotiate  is\n\nunfairly  handicapped  or that  its  ability  to settle  will  be\n\nsubstantially  enhanced  by  an   immediate  decision  about  the\n\nconstitutionality of the  Act.  Second, E&amp;Y is  not without other\n\noptions.  Proceedings are underway  in the state court that offer\n\na  vehicle for the expedited constitutional adjudication that E&amp;Y\n\nseeks, unaccompanied by the disadvantages  that deter us in  this\n\ncase. See  supra  note  10.    E&amp;Y is  already  a  party  to  the\r                          \n\nunderlying state-court litigation  and can, if  it chooses to  do\n\nso, participate in the proceedings before \n\nthe  Rhode  Island  Supreme  Court.     Finally,  as  some  other\n\ndefendants  reportedly have done, E&amp;Y can enter into negotiations\n\nwith Depco aimed at fashioning a settlement that is contingent on\n\nan  adjudication of the Act's constitutionality.   See supra note\r                                                                      \n\n11.\n\n          In  sum,  the  Depco  Act does  not  work  a sufficient\n\nhardship, gauged  by present  effects, to  justify  a finding  of\n\nripeness.    Though  E&amp;Y  may  feel some  discomfiture  over  the\n\nthreatened impairment of  its anticipated right to  contribution,\n\nthe burden of  which it complains is for the most part indigenous\n\n                                26\r\r\n\n to  the  litigation  process,  and,  thus,  it   cannot  be  made\r          weightless by the desired declaratory relief.\nV.  CONCLUSION\r          V.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We need  go no further.16   E&amp;Y yearns for  the blossom\n\nwhen only  the  bud  is ready.    Because its  challenge  to  the\n\nconstitutionality  of the Depco Act satisfies neither the fitness\n\nnor  the hardship prong  of the Abbott  Labs test, it  is not yet\r                                                      \n\nripe  for federal  judicial review.    Accordingly, the  district\n\ncourt's  dismissal of E&amp;Y's complaint  for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction must be\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \n\n                    \r                              \n\n     16Although  lack of ripeness is dispositive  here, we do not\nin any  way suggest that  the lower court's alternate  ground for\ndismissal    abstention    lacks  force.   In particular,  to the\nextent that the court's abstention ruling rests on the discretion\nprovided by the Declaratory Judgment  Act, see, e.g., El Dia, 963\r                                                                      \nF.2d  at  493-95, it  appears  fully  sustainable.   As  we  have\nindicated, the constitutional questions  presented by a challenge\nto the Depco Act are of great import  to Rhode Island, and lie at\nthe core of the  massive litigation that is  proceeding glacially\nin its court  system.  Even if no  individual abstention doctrine\nrequires federal courts to forgo review   a matter on which we do\nnot opine    the comity and federalism concerns  that animate the\nvarious  doctrines  strongly  suggest  that  dismissal  of  E&amp;Y's\ndeclaratory action mirrors the course of prudence.\n\n                                27\r\r\n",

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1991, Bruce Sundlun, newly inaugurated Governor of Rhode Island, proclaimed a banking emergency precipitated by the collapse of the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation (RISDIC), a firm that had insured deposits at no fewer than 45 Rhode Island-based financial institutions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Since those institutions could not operate legally without deposit insurance, see R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 19-11-9, the Governor closed them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lockout provoked a financial crisis, preventing depositors from withdrawing their funds and causing consternation in a myriad of other ways.  Over time, many of the affected institutions obtained insurance from sources such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and resumed operations.  Others were absorbed by insured entities.  In the end ten financial institutions were unable to reopen.  These financial institutions had something in common:  each of them had followed uncommonly adventurous lending practices, and had become insolvent.  They were all placed into conservatorship.  The Rhode Island General Assembly created a public corporation, the Depositors Economic Protection Corporation (Depco), to act as the receiver, manage the failed banks' estates, marshal and liquidate their assets, repay depositors, and seek recovery from those responsible for the fiasco.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In addition, Depco served as the receiver for RISDIC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A special state commission charged with investigating the banking crisis found no shortage of miscreants.  The commission assigned blame, inter alia, to former officers and directors of the failed institutions, certain large borrowers, the state Department of Business Regulation, the General Assembly, and a former governor.  The commission reserved some of its most stinging criticism for RISDIC and those persons who occupied prominent positions in the RISDIC hierarchy.  The commission included E &amp; Y, which had provided accounting services to RISDIC and to many of its insureds, as among the parties deserving special opprobrium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The banks' collapse proved to be a depositor's nightmare but a lawyer's dream, spawning a plethora of lawsuits.  For the most part, the depositors' and creditors' suits were consolidated in a series of master complaints (one for each failed institution) docketed in the state superior court.  Then, in early 1992, Depco and other plaintiffs filed a civil action in superior court against E &amp; Y and sundry other defendants.  In that suit, the plaintiffs charged E &amp; Y with negligence and professional malpractice.  Among other things, they alleged that E &amp; Y issued unqualified (or insufficiently qualified) audit opinions to RISDIC and a number of RISDIC-insured institutions despite obvious patterns of pervasive lending irregularities and other clear portents of impending financial disaster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July of 1993, the General Assembly revised state law as it pertained to the RISDIC cases by passing the Depco Act, Pub.L.1993, ch. 85.  The Act provides that potentially responsible parties who in good faith achieve judicially approved settlements with Depco will not be liable for contribution to other joint tortfeasors;  and that, if a putative defendant settles with Depco on this basis, the potential liability of other joint tortfeasors will be reduced only by the dollar amount of the settlement, not by the settling party's pro rata share of the aggregate liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act transmogrifies the law of contribution for purposes of the RISDIC cases.  Prior to its passage, a non-settling defendant in a negligence action--including a non-settling defendant in a RISDIC case--could, if found liable, seek contribution according to proportionate fault from all other joint tortfeasors, save only those who had entered settlements that explicitly released all claims against all potentially responsible parties for the settling tortfeasor's proportionate share of the overall liability.  See R.I.Gen.Laws Secs. 10-6-7, 10-6-8, 10-6-11 (1993).  In other words, prior law ensured that, if a joint tortfeasor were held responsible for (and paid) more than its ratable share of damages, it could seek contribution from other joint tortfeasors who had carried less than their fair share of the load.  Under the Depco Act, however, a non-settling tortfeasor can be held liable for more than its pro rata share of damages, yet find that it has no remaining right of contribution as to some (or, conceivably, all) of the coverage paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E &amp; Y did not go quietly into this dark night.  It promptly sued in the federal district court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> seeking a declaration that the Depco Act, on its face and as applied to E &amp; Y, transgresses the Federal Constitution.  Specifically, E &amp; Y urged the court to find that the Act violates the due process and equal protection clauses, and that it constitutes an unlawful bill of attainder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its complaint, E &amp; Y makes various allegations designed to highlight the ostensible unfairness of the legal predicament it now faces.  Stripped of animadversions, the complaint brands the Depco Act as special legislation drafted for the specific purpose of depriving E &amp; Y of preexisting substantive rights in order to intimidate E &amp; Y and thereby force a lucrative settlement of Depco's negligence action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Depco's strategy, E &amp; Y alleges, is to reach early settlements with most potentially responsible parties, limited to the face value of their respective liability insurance policies, but to treat E &amp; Y as a \"deep pocket\" from whom a huge settlement can be extracted.  E &amp; Y asserts that the doubts surrounding the viability of this strategy, and particularly the profound uncertainties about the Act's constitutionality, are currently imposing a substantial hardship on E &amp; Y in at least two ways.  First, the situation creates coercive pressure on E &amp; Y to settle the pending state court suit.  Second, it deprives E &amp; Y of the ability adequately to appraise its potential exposure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for want of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that the case lacked ripeness,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and, as a back-up, invoked several abstention theories.  The district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b), who recommended that the complaint be dismissed for want of subject matter jurisdiction, or, alternatively, in the exercise of the court's discretion.  E &amp; Y objected to the magistrate's report.  On de novo review, the district court characterized the complaint as unripe and dismissed it under Rule 12(b)(1).  See E &amp; Y v. Depco, 862 F.Supp. 709 (D.R.I.1994).  Judge Boyle stressed that since E &amp; Y would only be damaged by the Depco Act if a series of contingent events occurred in the future, it failed satisfactorily to demonstrate that \"it has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining a direct injury.\"  Id. at 714-15.   The judge went on to observe that, were the case ripe, comity and federalism concerns would nonetheless prompt him to abstain.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  See id. at 715-16 (citing Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971)).  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's determination that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the case before it is not ripe usually presents a question of law reviewable de novo in the court of appeals.  See Broughton Lumber Co. v. Columbia River Gorge Comm'n, 975 F.2d 616, 618 (9th Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 60, 126 L.Ed.2d 30 (1993);  Shea v. Rev-Lyn Contracting Co., 868 F.2d 515, 517 (1st Cir.1989);  Felmeister v. Office of Atty. Ethics, 856 F.2d 529, 535 n. 8 (3d Cir.1988).  This case is no exception to the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard of review that applies to a district court's discretionary decision to withhold a declaratory judgment is more problematic.  Some courts afford plenary review, but others affirm unless the trial court's decision constitutes an abuse of discretion.  Compare, e.g., Allstate Ins. Co. v. Mercier, 913 F.2d 273, 277 (6th Cir.1990) (utilizing plenary review) and Gayle Mfg. Co. v. Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Ins. Corp., 910 F.2d 574, 578 (9th Cir.1990) (same) with, e.g., Christopher P. v. Marcus, 915 F.2d 794, 802 (2d Cir.1990) (utilizing abuse of discretion standard), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1123, 111 S.Ct. 1081, 112 L.Ed.2d 1186 (1991), and Kunkel v. Continental Cas. Co., 866 F.2d 1269, 1273 (10th Cir.1989) (same).  We have captured a middle ground, expressing our preference for a standard of independent review when passing upon a trial court's discretionary decision to eschew declaratory relief.  This standard encourages the exercise of independent appellate judgment if it appears that a mistake has been made.  See El Dia, Inc. v. Hernandez Colon, 963 F.2d 488, 492 (1st Cir.1992);  National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Providence &amp; Worcester R.R. Co., 798 F.2d 8, 10 (1st Cir.1986).  Thus, independent review invokes a standard more rigorous than abuse of discretion, but less open-ended than de novo review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. Secs. 2201-2202 (1988), empowers a federal court to grant declaratory relief in a case of actual controversy.  The Act does not itself confer subject matter jurisdiction, but, rather, makes available an added anodyne for disputes that come within the federal courts' jurisdiction on some other basis.  See Franchise Tax Bd. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 15-16, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 2849-50, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Declaratory Judgment Act serves a valuable purpose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  It is designed to enable litigants to clarify legal rights and obligations before acting upon them.  See Step-Saver Data Sys., Inc. v. Wyse Tech., 912 F.2d 643, 649-50 (3d Cir.1990) (citing legislative history).  Because the Act offers a window of opportunity, not a guarantee of access, the courts, not the litigants, ultimately must determine when declaratory judgments are appropriate and when they are not.  Consequently, federal courts retain substantial discretion in deciding whether to grant declaratory relief.  As we have stated, the Declaratory Judgment Act \"neither imposes an unflagging duty upon the courts to decide declaratory judgment actions nor grants an entitlement to litigants to demand declaratory remedies.\"  El Dia, 963 F.2d at 493;  accord Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 72, 106 S.Ct. 423, 427-28, 88 L.Ed.2d 371 (1985);  Public Serv.  Comm'n v. Wycoff Co., 344 U.S. 237, 241, 73 S.Ct. 236, 239, 97 L.Ed. 291 (1952).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, then, an indigenous jurisprudence has sprouted in the fields where the seeds of declaratory actions are sown.  It is not necessary to harvest this jurisprudence today.  For present purposes, it suffices to sound a note of caution:  the discretion to grant declaratory relief is to be exercised with great circumspection when matters of public moment are involved, see Washington Pub. Power Supply Sys. v. Pacific N.W. Power Co., 332 F.2d 87, 88 (9th Cir.1964), or when a request for relief threatens to drag a federal court prematurely into constitutional issues that are freighted with uncertainty, see El Dia, 963 F.2d at 494.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. RIPENESS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first instance, the district court dismissed E &amp; Y's action due to ripeness concerns.  See E &amp; Y, 862 F.Supp. at 713-15.   E &amp; Y assigns error.  We discern none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>A. Examining The Ossature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its seminal opinion on the application of the ripeness doctrine in the declaratory judgment context, the Supreme Court explained that the doctrine's basic rationale is to \"prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements.\"  Abbott Labs v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1515, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967).  While the doctrine has a prudential flavor, a test for ripeness is also mandated by the constitutional requirement that federal jurisdiction extends only to actual cases or controversies, see U.S. Const. art.  III, Sec. 2;  see also Wycoff, 344 U.S. at 242-45, 73 S.Ct. at 239-41.   Consequently, although a court may, within stated limits, dismiss declaratory judgment actions in its discretion, a court has no alternative but to dismiss an unripe action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Questions of ripeness that arise incident to challenged governmental actions in the declaratory judgment context are gauged by means of a two-part test.  See Abbott Labs, 387 U.S. at 149, 87 S.Ct. at 1515-16.   First, the court must consider whether the issue presented is fit for review.  This branch of the test typically involves subsidiary queries concerning finality, definiteness, and the extent to which resolution of the challenge depends upon facts that may not yet be sufficiently developed.  See, e.g., W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. EPA, 959 F.2d 360, 364 (1st Cir.1992).  The second branch of the Abbott Labs test requires the court to consider the extent to which hardship looms--an inquiry that typically \"turns upon whether the challenged action creates a 'direct and immediate' dilemma for the parties.\"  Id. (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relationship between these two parts of the test--fitness and hardship--has never been precisely defined.  Though some commentators have suggested that either of the two showings may suffice to allay ripeness concerns, see, e.g., Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law Sec. 3-10, at 80 (2d ed. 1987), the predominant weight of authority supports the opposite view, see, e.g., Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 509, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 1759, 6 L.Ed.2d 989 (1961) (dismissing for lack of ripeness despite the predominantly legal nature of the question presented and the minimal need for an extensive factual record);  Cedars-Sinai Medical Ctr., v. Watkins, 11 F.3d 1573, 1581 (Fed.Cir.1993) (holding that a ripe case must meet both prongs of Abbott Labs );  see also Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction Sec. 2.4, at 124 (2d ed. 1994) (deriving examples from Supreme Court jurisprudence).  In line with the majority view, we hold that both prongs of the test ordinarily must be satisfied in order to establish ripeness.  In so holding, however, we acknowledge the possibility that there may be some sort of sliding scale under which, say, a very powerful exhibition of immediate hardship might compensate for questionable fitness (such as a degree of imprecision in the factual circumstances surrounding the case), or vice versa.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We end this segment of our opinion on yet another cautionary note.  The ripeness inquiry is often sui generis.   Most litigation has idiosyncratic features, and the various integers that enter into the ripeness equation play out quite differently from case to case, thus influencing the bottom line.  See, e.g., State of Rhode Island v. Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d 685, 693 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 298, 130 L.Ed.2d 211 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>B. Putting Flesh on the Bones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before determining whether E &amp; Y's initiative passes the Abbott Labs test, we pause to flesh out the test's two parts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Fitness.   We start with bedrock:  \"the critical question concerning fitness for review is whether the claim involves uncertain and contingent events that may not occur as anticipated or may not occur at all.\"  Massachusetts Ass'n of Afro-American Police, Inc. v. Boston Police Dep't, 973 F.2d 18, 20 (1st Cir.1992) (per curiam);  accord Lincoln House, Inc. v. Dupre, 903 F.2d 845, 847 (1st Cir.1990).  This conclusion reflects an institutional awareness that the fitness requirement has a pragmatic aspect:  issuing opinions based on speculative facts or a hypothetical record is an aleatory business, at best difficult and often impossible.  See, e.g., Calif.  Bankers Ass'n v. Schultz, 416 U.S. 21, 56, 94 S.Ct. 1494, 1515, 39 L.Ed.2d 812 (1974) (\"This Court, in the absence of a concrete fact situation in which competing associational and governmental interests can be weighed, is simply not in a position to determine [the question presented].\");  Socialist Labor Party v. Gilligan, 406 U.S. 583, 587, 92 S.Ct. 1716, 1718-19, 32 L.Ed.2d 317 (1972) (finding sole remaining issue unripe and dismissing appeal because the record lacks \"the sort of proved or admitted facts that would enable [the Court] to adjudicate th[e] claim\").  Nevertheless, the raw fact that events have not yet fully unfolded is not always fatal to justiciability.  In such straitened circumstances, courts sometimes exhibit a greater willingness to decide cases that turn on legal issues not likely to be significantly affected by further factual development.  See, e.g., Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conserv. &amp; Dev.  Comm'n, 461 U.S. 190, 201, 103 S.Ct. 1713, 1720-21, 75 L.Ed.2d 752 (1983) (finding fitness for judicial review supported by the \"predominantly legal\" nature of the question presented);  Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Envtl.  Study Group, Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 81-82, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 2634-35, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978) (finding fitness for judicial review supported by the fact that further factual development \"would not ... significantly advance [the judiciary's] ability to deal with the legal issues presented nor aid ... in their resolution\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Hardship.   The second half of the Abbott Labs inquiry focuses on the hardship that may be entailed in denying judicial review.  In general, the greater the hardship, the more apt a court will be to find ripeness.  See, e.g., Pacific Gas, 461 U.S. at 201 &amp; n. 13, 103 S.Ct. at 1720-21 &amp; n. 13.   Though the hallmark of cognizable hardship is usually direct and immediate harm, other kinds of injuries occasionally may suffice.  For example, if the operation of a challenged statute is inevitable, ripeness is not defeated by the existence of a time delay before the statute takes effect.  See Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. 102, 143, 95 S.Ct. 335, 358, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974).  And, moreover, even when the direct application of a statute is to some degree remote or contingent, its collateral effects may inflict present injuries that, though indirect, are adequate to support a finding of ripeness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, in Duke Power, the plaintiffs, some of whom resided near a nuclear power plant, sought a declaration as to the unconstitutionality of the Price-Anderson Act (which set a monetary cap on damages recoverable in consequence of nuclear accidents).  Even though the Court thought the possibility of a nuclear accident speculative, it nonetheless found the controversy ripe.  The Justices reasoned that the statute made feasible the construction of the plant, which, in turn, posed risks (such as fear of an accident, exposure to radiation, and thermal pollution) that would not otherwise exist.  See Duke Power, 438 U.S. at 81, 98 S.Ct. at 2634-35.   In the Court's view, these injuries were sufficient to support a finding of ripeness.  See id. at 81-82, 98 S.Ct. at 2634-35;  see also McCoy-Elkhorn Coal Corp. v. EPA, 622 F.2d 260, 263-65 (6th Cir.1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pacific Gas illustrates that, in special circumstances, an injury sufficient to impute ripeness may also be found when a plaintiff must presently decide to expend substantial resources which may turn out to be wasted, depending on later clarification of the law.  There, the Court determined that a group of utilities could challenge a state law imposing a moratorium on the construction of nuclear power plants.  See Pacific Gas, 461 U.S. at 197-200, 103 S.Ct. at 1718-20.   Noting the long lead time and the millions of dollars that had to be expended simply to proceed to the licensing stage in the course of developing a nuclear power plant, see id. at 201 n. 13, 103 S.Ct. at 1721 n. 13, the Court envisioned enormous hardship were it to require the industry to chart a course of action without knowing whether the moratorium was valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again, we end with watchful words.  A court's assessment of hardship need not be phrased solely in negative terms.  The key question involves the usefulness of a declaratory judgment, that is, the extent to which the desired declaration \"would be of practical assistance in setting the underlying controversy to rest.\"  Narragansett Tribe, 19 F.3d at 693.   Hence, courts should not become mired in the frequently sophistic distinction as to whether refusing declaratory relief will actually impose a hardship or merely fail to confer a benefit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>C. Applying the Test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Using Abbott Labs as the compass by which we must steer, we conclude, as did the district court, that E &amp; Y's claims are unripe.  First, the claims are not now fit for federal judicial review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Second, postponing an adjudication will not work a substantial hardship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Fitness.   On the fitness prong, E &amp; Y points to the fact that its complaint challenges the Depco Act both on its face and as applied.  The former claim, it tells us, is quintessentially legal in nature, and, therefore, suitable for immediate judicial review.  See, e.g., Pacific Gas, 461 U.S. at 201, 103 S.Ct. at 1720-21;  Duke Power, 438 U.S. at 81-82, 98 S.Ct. at 2634-35.   We believe that this is too simplistic a view, for it focuses narrowly on the claim's susceptibility to resolution and turns a blind eye to the related--but equally important--matter of whether judicial resolution is appropriate here and now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The notion that disputes which turn on purely legal questions are always ripe for judicial review is a myth.  Even when the \"legal\" emphasis of a particular claim is sufficient to mask gaps in the factual record, a court will find ripeness lacking if the anticipated events and injury are simply too remote to justify contemporaneous adjudication.  See Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclam.  Ass'n, Inc., 452 U.S. 264, 304, 101 S.Ct. 2352, 2374-75, 69 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981);  Lincoln House, 903 F.2d at 847;  Benson v. Superior Court, 663 F.2d 355, 360-61 (1st Cir.1981).  Put bluntly, the question of fitness does not pivot solely on whether a court is capable of resolving a claim intelligently, but also involves an assessment of whether it is appropriate for the court to undertake the task.  Federal courts cannot--and should not--spend their scarce resources in what amounts to shadow boxing.  Thus, if a plaintiff's claim, though predominantly legal in character, depends upon future events that may never come to pass, or that may not occur in the form forecasted, then the claim is unripe.  See Mass.  Ass'n of Afro-American Police, 973 F.2d at 20;  Lincoln House, 903 F.2d at 847;  see also Maryland Cas. Co. v. Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct. 510, 512, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941) (admonishing that a declaratory action is not ripe unless \"the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy ... of sufficient immediacy and reality\").  For this reason, the mere fact that E &amp; Y asserts a challenge to the Depco Act on its face, without more, cannot carry the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there is very little more:  E &amp; Y's claim lacks the needed dimensions of immediacy and reality.  The challenge is not rooted in the present, but depends on a lengthy chain of speculation as to what the future has in store.  Tracing the links in this chain demonstrates their fragility.  In order for E &amp; Y to be harmed by the operation of the statute, these events must come to pass:  (1) at least one person, firm, or corporation other than E &amp; Y must admit fault, or be found to have been at fault, and must have caused recoverable damages arising out of the banking crisis;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  (2) that other party must settle with Depco;  (3) the settlement must be entered into in good faith and approved by a competent court;  (4) under the bargained terms, the settlor must pay less than its pro rata share, measured by relative fault;  (5) perhaps most critically, E &amp; Y--which, to this date, has steadfastly denied fault--must be found to have been negligent, and its negligence must be found to have caused or contributed to the damages;  (6) Depco must attempt to collect an amount greater than E &amp; Y's pro rata share of the damages;  (7) a court must find E &amp; Y liable for, and order it to pay, the tribute demanded;  and (8) E &amp; Y must then seek contribution from one or more of the \"underpaying\" joint tortfeasors (who, presumably, will interpose the statute as a defense).  This is a long string of contingencies--so long that E &amp; Y's assertion of fitness for judicial review trips over it and falls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts should always be hesitant to answer hypothetical questions.  See Poe, 367 U.S. at 503, 81 S.Ct. at 1755-56.   That hesitancy does not evaporate merely because a suit is couched as a plea for declaratory relief.  See, e.g., Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240-41, 57 S.Ct. 461, 463-64, 81 L.Ed. 617 (1937) (explaining that courts, in the guise of declaratory judgment, should not issue opinions \"advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts\").  The manifold uncertainties that attend this case in its present posture bring to mind this principle:  even though the legal question presented by E &amp; Y's facial challenge to the Depco Act is not likely to be placed in sharper focus by further factual development, the claim is unripe because any application of the challenged statute to E &amp; Y depends on serendipitous events that may not occur as anticipated--or may not occur at all.  The case that E &amp; Y argues is, at this stage, largely hypothetical, and such cases are seldom fit for federal judicial review.  Cf. William Shakespeare, Macbeth, act I, sc. iii, ll. 133-34 (1605) (reminding readers that \"present fears are [often] less than horrible imaginings\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This recital does not come close to exhausting E &amp; Y's problems on the fitness prong of the Abbott Labs test.  Over and beyond the potential waste of judicial resources that entertaining a remote and speculative claim would risk, there are other telltale signs that a finding of fitness is not warranted here.  We mention two such indicators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first telltale has a prudential cast.  Were we to permit E &amp; Y's action to be decided now, we would be setting in motion a constitutional adjudication that not only could have a thunderous impact on important state interests but that might well prove to be completely unnecessary (if, say, E &amp; Y were later found to have exercised due care, or if the parties settled for an amount that did not exceed E &amp; Y's pro rata share of the recoverable damages).  Courts should strive to avoid gratuitous journeys through forbidding constitutional terrain.  See Poe, 367 U.S. at 502-04, 81 S.Ct. at 1755-56;  see also El Dia, 963 F.2d at 494 (counselling that \"[u]ncertain questions of constitutional law should be addressed only when absolutely necessary\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second disincentive to a finding of fitness relates to the absence of other parties having a stake in the controversy.  E &amp; Y has sued a state agency and two state officials.  See supra note 4.  While we do not doubt that these parties will defend the Act's constitutionality, E &amp; Y's suit lacks full adverseness.  See generally Narragansett Tribe, 19 F.3d at 692-93 (discussing adverseness requirement).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The real parties in interest are presumably the other joint tortfeasors (if any there be).  After all, because tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable under Rhode Island law, Depco can collect the total amount of damages from E &amp; Y regardless of what regime governs tortfeasors' rights of contribution.  Thus, Depco's only interest in the Act relates to its efficacy as a negotiating tool.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows that, if E &amp; Y is harmed at all, the parties most directly adverse to it will be underpaying tortfeasors--those who settle for less than their proportionate shares and who would, without the prophylaxis of the Depco Act, face liability to overpaying tortfeasors for contribution.  These persons cannot be made parties to this litigation now because there is no way of predicting at this early date who they will be--or even if they will exist.  Hence, E &amp; Y's action, under current conditions, is incompletely adverse.  This is a serious indictment, for a lawsuit that is hobbed in this manner is much less likely to be ripe for judicial review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  See Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Moore, 333 U.S. 541, 549-50, 68 S.Ct. 682, 687-88, 92 L.Ed. 863 (1948) (considering the absence of affected parties relevant to ripeness).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it is reasonably plain from what we have said that E &amp; Y's claim, as it now stands, is not only incompletely adverse, but also remote, speculative, premature, and lacking in practical value.  These factors, coupled with E &amp; Y's desire to hurry the federal courts toward a tangled constitutional adjudication that may, in the end, prove to be inutile, render its suit inappropriate for immediate judicial review.  Ergo, E &amp; Y's challenge fails to satisfy the fitness prong of the Abbott Labs test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Hardship.   By like token, we do not think that E &amp; Y's case passes muster under the hardship prong of Abbott Labs.   E &amp; Y alleges that it is currently suffering two kinds of adverse effects from the Act, namely, increased pressure to settle Depco's suit and an inability to evaluate its exposure therein.  These harms are indirect.  And although it is true that present indirect effects occasionally may wreak a sufficient hardship to support a finding of ripeness, see, e.g., Pacific Gas, 461 U.S. at 201, 103 S.Ct. at 1720-21, the effects of which E &amp; Y complains are not so pernicious.  There is quite a difference between increasing the risk of exposure to radiation, Duke Power, 438 U.S. at 81-82, 98 S.Ct. at 2634-35, and increasing the difficulty of evaluating a money damages claim for settlement purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The uncertainty of which E &amp; Y complains in this case arises in the context of bilateral negotiations, not yet under way, in which opposing parties will explore the possibility of settling a hotly disputed case based partly on the expected results of the litigation. That situation presents a type of hardship that is qualitatively different than those displayed in Pacific Gas and Duke Power, for resolving the challenge to the Depco Act will help the challenger only marginally.  Either way, E &amp; Y still will be faced with the incubus of pending litigation.  Either way, E &amp; Y still will have to make an evaluative judgment anent the desirability of settlement on various terms--a judgment that depends on many factors other than its right to contribution (and, accordingly, on many factors that will not be clarified by an immediate determination of the statute's constitutionality).  The usefulness that may satisfy the hardship prong of Abbott Labs is not met by a party showing that it has the opportunity to move from a position of utter confusion to one of mere befuddlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to deny that a declaratory decree might have some utility.  If the declaratory action proceeds to a conclusion, the parties will obtain an additional piece of information that will help them to determine a settlement strategy.  The point, however, is that E &amp; Y--though it will be better informed--still will not be spared the need to make the very sort of evaluative judgment that it tells us it is striving to avoid.  What is more, E &amp; Y still will not control its own destiny in respect to settlement, for Depco might (or might not) be willing to settle on E &amp; Y's terms, and other tortfeasors might (or might not) leave themselves open to contribution claims, regardless of whether the declaratory judgment action proceeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The limited utility of the judgment that E &amp; Y seeks here is highlighted by the fact that the \"value\" of a case for settlement purposes is always a moving target.  Phrased another way, settlement value is at best an estimate, subjective in nature, reflecting the worth that the parties themselves, for myriad reasons, attach to their case.  See Mathewson Corp. v. Allied Marine Indus., Inc., 827 F.2d 850, 855 (1st Cir.1987).  It follows inexorably that the settlement value of Depco's claim against E &amp; Y will not be determined by the incidence of rights of contribution alone.  See generally Note, Private Settlement as Alternative Adjudication:  A Rationale for Negotiation Ethics, 18 U.Mich.J.L.Ref. 503, 515 n. 16 (1985) (explaining that one cannot \"presum[e] that projected legal rights are the principal determinants of negotiated agreements....  [O]ther considerations incident to bargaining power, such as relative financial strength and eagerness to avoid trial, are often vitally important to both the process and ultimate content of private settlements\").  Because settlement evaluations typically \"are the product of intangible criteria which defy quantification,\" Mathewson, 827 F.2d at 855, the present uncertainty will only be lessened somewhat, not avoided, should the action proceed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, a litigant's plaints of hardship cannot be assessed in a vacuum.  Rather, a claim of hardship demands an assessment of the complainant's position in light of all the attendant circumstances.  See State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co. v. Dole, 802 F.2d 474, 479 (D.C.Cir.1986) (noting that application of Abbott Labs is not \"a matter of weaving complicated legal distinctions divorced from reality,\" but, rather, requires the exercise of \"practical common sense\") (internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 951, 107 S.Ct. 1616, 94 L.Ed.2d 800 (1987);  cf. Narragansett Tribe, 19 F.3d at 692-93 (explaining that the inquiry into adverseness likewise requires an assessment of all the attendant circumstances).  Here, three facts soften the sharp edges of E &amp; Y's professed hardship, and, therefore, counsel restraint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the contingent nature of E &amp; Y's claim has implications for hardship as well for fitness.  Given the stretched chain of events that must transpire before the Act can harm E &amp; Y, and the speculative nature of many of those events, we remain unconvinced either that E &amp; Y's ability to negotiate is unfairly handicapped or that its ability to settle will be substantially enhanced by an immediate decision about the constitutionality of the Act.  Second, E &amp; Y is not without other options.  Proceedings are underway in the state court that offer a vehicle for the expedited constitutional adjudication that E &amp; Y seeks, unaccompanied by the disadvantages that deter us in this case.  See supra note 10.  E &amp; Y is already a party to the underlying state-court litigation and can, if it chooses to do so, participate in the proceedings before the Rhode Island Supreme Court.  Finally, as some other defendants reportedly have done, E &amp; Y can enter into negotiations with Depco aimed at fashioning a settlement that is contingent on an adjudication of the Act's constitutionality.  See supra note 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the Depco Act does not work a sufficient hardship, gauged by present effects, to justify a finding of ripeness.  Though E &amp; Y may feel some discomfiture over the threatened impairment of its anticipated right to contribution, the burden of which it complains is for the most part indigenous to the litigation process, and, thus, it cannot be made weightless by the desired declaratory relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  E &amp; Y yearns for the blossom when only the bud is ready.  Because its challenge to the constitutionality of the Depco Act satisfies neither the fitness nor the hardship prong of the Abbott Labs test, it is not yet ripe for federal judicial review.  Accordingly, the district court's dismissal of E &amp; Y's complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Rhode Island General Assembly chartered RISDIC in 1969 as a private deposit-insurance corporation.  It began operations in 1971, subject only to state, not federal, regulation.

Such settlement does not discharge any other tortfeasors unless its terms so provide, but it reduces the potential liability of such joint tortfeasors by the amount of the settlement.</p>\n        <p>R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 42-116-40 (1993).  The idea behind the statute is scarcely original;  the Depco Act is modeled on the special contribution provisions contained in the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation &amp; Liability Act (CERCLA), see 42 U.S.C. Sec. 9613(f)(2)-(3) (1988);  see also United States v. Cannons Eng'g Corp., 899 F.2d 79, 91-92 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining operation of CERCLA contribution provisions).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> E &amp; Y's complaint named Governor Sundlun, Depco, and Depco's executive director as defendants.  For simplicity's sake, we refer to the defendants, collectively, as \"Depco.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> E &amp; Y adds various details designed to bolster this claim, including a charge that Depco's specially retained trial counsel lobbied for passage of the Act, telling legislators that changing the law of contribution greatly improved Depco's bargaining position vis-a-vis E &amp; Y</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> On appeal, Depco advances the closely related argument that E &amp; Y lacks standing.  Despite their natural imbrication, these asseverations are distinct;  the standing doctrine is concerned with who may bring a particular suit, while the ripeness doctrine is concerned with when a party may bring suit.  Because we hold that the controversy is not ripe, we eschew any consideration of whether E &amp; Y also lacks standing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Judge Boyle also expressed his view that the Depco Act did not comprise a bill of attainder.  See E &amp; Y, 862 F.Supp. at 716-17.   The court's statements on this score are gratuitous, and we express no opinion on them</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The Declaratory Judgment Act is mirrored by Fed.R.Civ.P. 57.  The statute and the rule are functionally equivalent.  See, e.g., 118 E. 60th Owners, Inc. v. Bonner Props., Inc., 677 F.2d 200, 205 n. 8 (2d Cir.1982) (treating Rule 57 as implementing the remedy authorized by the Act)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We need not probe this final point, for E &amp; Y has not made a sufficiently strong showing under either of the test's two prongs.  See infra Part IV(C)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> State judicial review is, however, in the offing.  Shortly before we heard oral argument, Depco asked the state superior court to certify questions anent the constitutionality of the Depco Act to the state supreme court.  Depco made the motion in a tort case it had commenced involving the collapse of the Brown University Employees Credit Union, a RISDIC-insured institution.  Over E &amp; Y's objection--E &amp; Y is a third-party defendant in the suit--the superior court granted Depco's motion.  The state supreme court received the certified questions, paired them with a strikingly similar set of constitutional issues limned by the Governor in a pending request for an advisory opinion, see R.I. Const. art.  X, Sec. 3 (authorizing the governor to request such advisory opinions from the state supreme court), and promulgated a consolidated briefing schedule.  Although E &amp; Y correctly maintains that announcing a briefing schedule is not tantamount to reaching the merits of the certified questions, it appears likely that the Rhode Island Supreme Court will soon hear oral arguments</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Depco apparently has reached one settlement that is expressly conditioned on the constitutionality of the Depco Act being upheld by the Rhode Island Supreme Court.  See supra note 10.  In the settlement papers the settling defendants disclaim any wrongdoing, and Depco agrees not to treat the fact of settlement as an admission of liability.  The more widespread this pattern of settlement becomes, the more arduous it will be to fulfill the \"other tortfeasor\" requirement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> E &amp; Y touts Narragansett Tribe, a case in which we found disputed issues ripe, as directly applicable precedent.  We do not agree.  There, unlike in this case, the state's suit fully satisfied the adverseness requirement.  See Narragansett Tribe, 19 F.3d at 692-93.   Other distinctions abound;  the arguably unripe issues in that case were not of constitutional stature, the public interest favored immediate adjudication, comity was not a problem (as, there, unlike here, the state urged the federal court to proceed), the hardship that would flow from non-adjudication was starkly apparent, and the utility of a prompt decision was more easily discernible</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> The absence of affected parties also has implications for the hardship vel non of denying review, see infra Part IV(C)(2).  Even if E &amp; Y were to prevail in the instant action, it seems likely that settling joint tortfeasors, not parties here, would be entitled to relitigate the Depco Act's constitutionality in defending subsequent contribution actions brought by E &amp; Y.  See NLRB v. Donna-Lee Sportswear Co., 836 F.2d 31, 33-34 (1st Cir.1987) (explaining requirements for collateral estoppel);  E.W. Audet &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., 635 A.2d 1181, 1186-87 (R.I.1994) (similar;  elucidating Rhode Island law)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> We have discussed only E &amp; Y's challenge to the constitutionality of the Depco Act on its face.  To go further would be supererogatory.  Because the facial challenge is unfit for review, it follows a fortiori that the \"as applied\" challenge to a freshly minted statute that has yet to make its maiden voyage is also unfit</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> It perhaps bears noting that the lack of certitude both helps and hurts E &amp; Y.  On one hand, the uncertainty admittedly generates pressure on E &amp; Y to pay more by way of settlement.  But on the other hand, the uncertainty also encourages Depco to settle for less than it would demand if it knew beyond any peradventure of doubt that the Act would withstand constitutional scrutiny.  By the same token, a resolution of the constitutional question would cut both ways.  If a court upholds the Depco Act, E &amp; Y probably will be faced with the prospect of paying more for a release, whereas, if a court invalidates the Act, E &amp; Y probably will be able to pay less.  This shifting array of possibilities, tilting first in one direction and then in the other, further dilutes E &amp; Y's claim of an intolerable hardship</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Although lack of ripeness is dispositive here, we do not in any way suggest that the lower court's alternate ground for dismissal--abstention--lacks force.  In particular, to the extent that the court's abstention ruling rests on the discretion provided by the Declaratory Judgment Act, see, e.g., El Dia, 963 F.2d at 493-95, it appears fully sustainable.  As we have indicated, the constitutional questions presented by a challenge to the Depco Act are of great import to Rhode Island, and lie at the core of the massive litigation that is proceeding glacially in its court system.  Even if no individual abstention doctrine requires federal courts to forgo review--a matter on which we do not opine--the comity and federalism concerns that animate the various doctrines strongly suggest that dismissal of E &amp; Y's declaratory action mirrors the course of prudence</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The district court dismissed the complaint because the controversy lacked ripeness, and, alternatively, because it invited abstention.  E &amp; Y appeals.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1991, Bruce Sundlun, newly inaugurated Governor of Rhode Island, proclaimed a banking emergency precipitated by the collapse of the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation (RISDIC), a firm that had insured deposits at no fewer than 45 Rhode Island-based financial institutions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Since those institutions could not operate legally without deposit insurance, see R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 19-11-9, the Governor closed them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lockout provoked a financial crisis, preventing depositors from withdrawing their funds and causing consternation in a myriad of other ways.  Over time, many of the affected institutions obtained insurance from sources such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and resumed operations.  Others were absorbed by insured entities.  In the end ten financial institutions were unable to reopen.  These financial institutions had something in common:  each of them had followed uncommonly adventurous lending practices, and had become insolvent.  They were all placed into conservatorship.  The Rhode Island General Assembly created a public corporation, the Depositors Economic Protection Corporation (Depco), to act as the receiver, manage the failed banks' estates, marshal and liquidate their assets, repay depositors, and seek recovery from those responsible for the fiasco.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In addition, Depco served as the receiver for RISDIC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A special state commission charged with investigating the banking crisis found no shortage of miscreants.  The commission assigned blame, inter alia, to former officers and directors of the failed institutions, certain large borrowers, the state Department of Business Regulation, the General Assembly, and a former governor.  The commission reserved some of its most stinging criticism for RISDIC and those persons who occupied prominent positions in the RISDIC hierarchy.  The commission included E &amp; Y, which had provided accounting services to RISDIC and to many of its insureds, as among the parties deserving special opprobrium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The banks' collapse proved to be a depositor's nightmare but a lawyer's dream, spawning a plethora of lawsuits.  For the most part, the depositors' and creditors' suits were consolidated in a series of master complaints (one for each failed institution) docketed in the state superior court.  Then, in early 1992, Depco and other plaintiffs filed a civil action in superior court against E &amp; Y and sundry other defendants.  In that suit, the plaintiffs charged E &amp; Y with negligence and professional malpractice.  Among other things, they alleged that E &amp; Y issued unqualified (or insufficiently qualified) audit opinions to RISDIC and a number of RISDIC-insured institutions despite obvious patterns of pervasive lending irregularities and other clear portents of impending financial disaster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July of 1993, the General Assembly revised state law as it pertained to the RISDIC cases by passing the Depco Act, Pub.L.1993, ch. 85.  The Act provides that potentially responsible parties who in good faith achieve judicially approved settlements with Depco will not be liable for contribution to other joint tortfeasors;  and that, if a putative defendant settles with Depco on this basis, the potential liability of other joint tortfeasors will be reduced only by the dollar amount of the settlement, not by the settling party's pro rata share of the aggregate liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act transmogrifies the law of contribution for purposes of the RISDIC cases.  Prior to its passage, a non-settling defendant in a negligence action--including a non-settling defendant in a RISDIC case--could, if found liable, seek contribution according to proportionate fault from all other joint tortfeasors, save only those who had entered settlements that explicitly released all claims against all potentially responsible parties for the settling tortfeasor's proportionate share of the overall liability.  See R.I.Gen.Laws Secs. 10-6-7, 10-6-8, 10-6-11 (1993).  In other words, prior law ensured that, if a joint tortfeasor were held responsible for (and paid) more than its ratable share of damages, it could seek contribution from other joint tortfeasors who had carried less than their fair share of the load.  Under the Depco Act, however, a non-settling tortfeasor can be held liable for more than its pro rata share of damages, yet find that it has no remaining right of contribution as to some (or, conceivably, all) of the coverage paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E &amp; Y did not go quietly into this dark night.  It promptly sued in the federal district court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> seeking a declaration that the Depco Act, on its face and as applied to E &amp; Y, transgresses the Federal Constitution.  Specifically, E &amp; Y urged the court to find that the Act violates the due process and equal protection clauses, and that it constitutes an unlawful bill of attainder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its complaint, E &amp; Y makes various allegations designed to highlight the ostensible unfairness of the legal predicament it now faces.  Stripped of animadversions, the complaint brands the Depco Act as special legislation drafted for the specific purpose of depriving E &amp; Y of preexisting substantive rights in order to intimidate E &amp; Y and thereby force a lucrative settlement of Depco's negligence action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Depco's strategy, E &amp; Y alleges, is to reach early settlements with most potentially responsible parties, limited to the face value of their respective liability insurance policies, but to treat E &amp; Y as a \"deep pocket\" from whom a huge settlement can be extracted.  E &amp; Y asserts that the doubts surrounding the viability of this strategy, and particularly the profound uncertainties about the Act's constitutionality, are currently imposing a substantial hardship on E &amp; Y in at least two ways.  First, the situation creates coercive pressure on E &amp; Y to settle the pending state court suit.  Second, it deprives E &amp; Y of the ability adequately to appraise its potential exposure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for want of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that the case lacked ripeness,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and, as a back-up, invoked several abstention theories.  The district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b), who recommended that the complaint be dismissed for want of subject matter jurisdiction, or, alternatively, in the exercise of the court's discretion.  E &amp; Y objected to the magistrate's report.  On de novo review, the district court characterized the complaint as unripe and dismissed it under Rule 12(b)(1).  See E &amp; Y v.

We have captured a middle ground, expressing our preference for a standard of independent review when passing upon a trial court's discretionary decision to eschew declaratory relief.  This standard encourages the exercise of independent appellate judgment if it appears that a mistake has been made.  See El Dia, Inc. v.

Secs. 2201-2202 (1988), empowers a federal court to grant declaratory relief in a case of actual controversy.  The Act does not itself confer subject matter jurisdiction, but, rather, makes available an added anodyne for disputes that come within the federal courts' jurisdiction on some other basis.  See Franchise Tax Bd. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110990\"><a href=\"/opinion/110990/franchise-tax-bd-of-cal-v-construction-laborers-vacation-trust-for/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 15-16, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110990\"><a href=\"/opinion/110990/franchise-tax-bd-of-cal-v-construction-laborers-vacation-trust-for/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because the Act offers a window of opportunity, not a guarantee of access, the courts, not the litigants, ultimately must determine when declaratory judgments are appropriate and when they are not.  Consequently, federal courts retain substantial discretion in deciding whether to grant declaratory relief.

Gardner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107451\"><a href=\"/opinion/107451/abbott-laboratories-v-gardner/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span>, 148-49, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107451\"><a href=\"/opinion/107451/abbott-laboratories-v-gardner/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span> </a></span>(1967).  While the doctrine has a prudential flavor, a test for ripeness is also mandated by the constitutional requirement that federal jurisdiction extends only to actual cases or controversies, see U.S. Const. art.  III, Sec. 2;  see also <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105059\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Wycoff,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/105059/public-serv-commn-of-utah-v-wycoff-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">242-45</span></a></span>, 73 S.Ct. at 239-41.   Consequently, although a court may, within stated limits, dismiss declaratory judgment actions in its discretion, a court has no alternative but to dismiss an unripe action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Questions of ripeness that arise incident to challenged governmental actions in the declaratory judgment context are gauged by means of a two-part test.  See Abbott <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107451\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Labs,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/107451/abbott-laboratories-v-gardner/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span>, 87 S.Ct. at 1515-16.   First, the court must consider whether the issue presented is fit for review.  This branch of the test typically involves subsidiary queries concerning finality, definiteness, and the extent to which resolution of the challenge depends upon facts that may not yet be sufficiently developed.  See, e.g., W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. EPA, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579948\"><a href=\"/opinion/579948/wr-grace-co-conn-v-united-states-environmental-protection-agency/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></a></span>, 364 (1st Cir.1992).  The second branch of the Abbott Labs test requires the court to consider the extent to which hardship looms--an inquiry that typically \"turns upon whether the challenged action creates a 'direct and immediate' dilemma for the parties.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579948\"><a href=\"/opinion/579948/wr-grace-co-conn-v-united-states-environmental-protection-agency/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (citation omitted).</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relationship between these two parts of the test--fitness and hardship--has never been precisely defined.  Though some commentators have suggested that either of the two showings may suffice to allay ripeness concerns, see, e.g., Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law Sec. 3-10, at 80 (2d ed. 1987), the predominant weight of authority supports the opposite view, see, e.g., Poe v. Ullman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106282\"><a href=\"/opinion/106282/poe-v-ullman/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span>, 509, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106282\"><a href=\"/opinion/106282/poe-v-ullman/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In line with the majority view, we hold that both prongs of the test ordinarily must be satisfied in order to establish ripeness.  In so holding, however, we acknowledge the possibility that there may be some sort of sliding scale under which, say, a very powerful exhibition of immediate hardship might compensate for questionable fitness (such as a degree of imprecision in the factual circumstances surrounding the case), or vice versa.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We end this segment of our opinion on yet another cautionary note.

Hardship.   The second half of the Abbott Labs inquiry focuses on the hardship that may be entailed in denying judicial review.  In general, the greater the hardship, the more apt a court will be to find ripeness.  See, e.g., Pacific <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110919\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gas,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/110919/pacific-gas-elec-co-v-state-energy-resources-conservation-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">201</span> </a></span>&amp; n. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">13,</span> <span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Though the hallmark of cognizable hardship is usually direct and immediate harm, other kinds of injuries occasionally may suffice.  For example, if the operation of a challenged statute is inevitable, ripeness is not defeated by the existence of a time delay before the statute takes effect.  See Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109117\"><a href=\"/opinion/109117/regional-rail-reorganization-act-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span>, 143, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109117\"><a href=\"/opinion/109117/regional-rail-reorganization-act-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And, moreover, even when the direct application of a statute is to some degree remote or contingent, its collateral effects may inflict present injuries that, though indirect, are adequate to support a finding of ripeness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, in Duke Power, the plaintiffs, some of whom resided near a nuclear power plant, sought a declaration as to the unconstitutionality of the Price-Anderson Act (which set a monetary cap on damages recoverable in consequence of nuclear accidents).  Even though the Court thought the possibility of a nuclear accident speculative, it nonetheless found the controversy ripe.  The Justices reasoned that the statute made feasible the construction of the plant, which, in turn, posed risks (such as fear of an accident, exposure to radiation, and thermal pollution) that would not otherwise exist.  See Duke <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109923\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Power,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/109923/duke-power-co-v-carolina-environmental-study-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 98 S.Ct. at 2634-35.

A court's assessment of hardship need not be phrased solely in negative terms.  The key question involves the usefulness of a declaratory judgment, that is, the extent to which the desired declaration \"would be of practical assistance in setting the underlying controversy to rest.\"  Narragansett <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195256\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Tribe,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195256/state-of-ri-v-narragansett-tribe/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span>.

First, the claims are not now fit for federal judicial review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Second, postponing an adjudication will not work a substantial hardship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Fitness.   On the fitness prong, E &amp; Y points to the fact that its complaint challenges the Depco Act both on its face and as applied.  The former claim, it tells us, is quintessentially legal in nature, and, therefore, suitable for immediate judicial review.  See, e.g., Pacific <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110919\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gas,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/110919/pacific-gas-elec-co-v-state-energy-resources-conservation-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span>, 103 S.Ct. at 1720-21;  Duke <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109923\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Power,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/109923/duke-power-co-v-carolina-environmental-study-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>-82, 98 S.Ct. at 2634-35.   We believe that this is too simplistic a view, for it focuses narrowly on the claim's susceptibility to resolution and turns a blind eye to the related--but equally important--matter of whether judicial resolution is appropriate here and now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The notion that disputes which turn on purely legal questions are always ripe for judicial review is a myth.  Even when the \"legal\" emphasis of a particular claim is sufficient to mask gaps in the factual record, a court will find ripeness lacking if the anticipated events and injury are simply too remote to justify contemporaneous adjudication.

Put bluntly, the question of fitness does not pivot solely on whether a court is capable of resolving a claim intelligently, but also involves an assessment of whether it is appropriate for the court to undertake the task.  Federal courts cannot--and should not--spend their scarce resources in what amounts to shadow boxing.  Thus, if a plaintiff's claim, though predominantly legal in character, depends upon future events that may never come to pass, or that may not occur in the form forecasted, then the claim is unripe.

The challenge is not rooted in the present, but depends on a lengthy chain of speculation as to what the future has in store.  Tracing the links in this chain demonstrates their fragility.  In order for E &amp; Y to be harmed by the operation of the statute, these events must come to pass:  (1) at least one person, firm, or corporation other than E &amp; Y must admit fault, or be found to have been at fault, and must have caused recoverable damages arising out of the banking crisis;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  (2) that other party must settle with Depco;  (3) the settlement must be entered into in good faith and approved by a competent court;  (4) under the bargained terms, the settlor must pay less than its pro rata share, measured by relative fault;  (5) perhaps most critically, E &amp; Y--which, to this date, has steadfastly denied fault--must be found to have been negligent, and its negligence must be found to have caused or contributed to the damages;  (6) Depco must attempt to collect an amount greater than E &amp; Y's pro rata share of the damages;  (7) a court must find E &amp; Y liable for, and order it to pay, the tribute demanded;  and (8) E &amp; Y must then seek contribution from one or more of the \"underpaying\" joint tortfeasors (who, presumably, will interpose the statute as a defense).  This is a long string of contingencies--so long that E &amp; Y's assertion of fitness for judicial review trips over it and falls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts should always be hesitant to answer hypothetical questions.

That hesitancy does not evaporate merely because a suit is couched as a plea for declaratory relief.  See, e.g., Aetna Life Ins. Co. v.

The manifold uncertainties that attend this case in its present posture bring to mind this principle:  even though the legal question presented by E &amp; Y's facial challenge to the Depco Act is not likely to be placed in sharper focus by further factual development, the claim is unripe because any application of the challenged statute to E &amp; Y depends on serendipitous events that may not occur as anticipated--or may not occur at all.  The case that E &amp; Y argues is, at this stage, largely hypothetical, and such cases are seldom fit for federal judicial review.  Cf. William Shakespeare, Macbeth, act I, sc. iii, ll. 133-34 (1605) (reminding readers that \"present fears are [often] less than horrible imaginings\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This recital does not come close to exhausting E &amp; Y's problems on the fitness prong of the Abbott Labs test.

We mention two such indicators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first telltale has a prudential cast.  Were we to permit E &amp; Y's action to be decided now, we would be setting in motion a constitutional adjudication that not only could have a thunderous impact on important state interests but that might well prove to be completely unnecessary (if, say, E &amp; Y were later found to have exercised due care, or if the parties settled for an amount that did not exceed E &amp; Y's pro rata share of the recoverable damages).  Courts should strive to avoid gratuitous journeys through forbidding constitutional terrain.

E &amp; Y has sued a state agency and two state officials.  See supra note 4.  While we do not doubt that these parties will defend the Act's constitutionality, E &amp; Y's suit lacks full adverseness.  See generally Narragansett <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195256\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Tribe,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195256/state-of-ri-v-narragansett-tribe/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">692-93</span> </a></span>(discussing adverseness requirement).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The real parties in interest are presumably the other joint tortfeasors (if any there be).  After all, because tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable under Rhode Island law, Depco can collect the total amount of damages from E &amp; Y regardless of what regime governs tortfeasors' rights of contribution.  Thus, Depco's only interest in the Act relates to its efficacy as a negotiating tool.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows that, if E &amp; Y is harmed at all, the parties most directly adverse to it will be underpaying tortfeasors--those who settle for less than their proportionate shares and who would, without the prophylaxis of the Depco Act, face liability to overpaying tortfeasors for contribution.  These persons cannot be made parties to this litigation now because there is no way of predicting at this early date who they will be--or even if they will exist.  Hence, E &amp; Y's action, under current conditions, is incompletely adverse.  This is a serious indictment, for a lawsuit that is hobbed in this manner is much less likely to be ripe for judicial review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  See Connecticut Mut.

These factors, coupled with E &amp; Y's desire to hurry the federal courts toward a tangled constitutional adjudication that may, in the end, prove to be inutile, render its suit inappropriate for immediate judicial review.  Ergo, E &amp; Y's challenge fails to satisfy the fitness prong of the Abbott Labs test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Hardship.   By like token, we do not think that E &amp; Y's case passes muster under the hardship prong of Abbott Labs.   E &amp; Y alleges that it is currently suffering two kinds of adverse effects from the Act, namely, increased pressure to settle Depco's suit and an inability to evaluate its exposure therein.  These harms are indirect.  And although it is true that present indirect effects occasionally may wreak a sufficient hardship to support a finding of ripeness, see, e.g., Pacific <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110919\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gas,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/110919/pacific-gas-elec-co-v-state-energy-resources-conservation-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span>, 103 S.Ct. at 1720-21, the effects of which E &amp; Y complains are not so pernicious.

That situation presents a type of hardship that is qualitatively different than those displayed in Pacific Gas and Duke Power, for resolving the challenge to the Depco Act will help the challenger only marginally.  Either way, E &amp; Y still will be faced with the incubus of pending litigation.  Either way, E &amp; Y still will have to make an evaluative judgment anent the desirability of settlement on various terms--a judgment that depends on many factors other than its right to contribution (and, accordingly, on many factors that will not be clarified by an immediate determination of the statute's constitutionality).  The usefulness that may satisfy the hardship prong of Abbott Labs is not met by a party showing that it has the opportunity to move from a position of utter confusion to one of mere befuddlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to deny that a declaratory decree might have some utility.  If the declaratory action proceeds to a conclusion, the parties will obtain an additional piece of information that will help them to determine a settlement strategy.  The point, however, is that E &amp; Y--though it will be better informed--still will not be spared the need to make the very sort of evaluative judgment that it tells us it is striving to avoid.  What is more, E &amp; Y still will not control its own destiny in respect to settlement, for Depco might (or might not) be willing to settle on E &amp; Y's terms, and other tortfeasors might (or might not) leave themselves open to contribution claims, regardless of whether the declaratory judgment action proceeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The limited utility of the judgment that E &amp; Y seeks here is highlighted by the fact that the \"value\" of a case for settlement purposes is always a moving target.  Phrased another way, settlement value is at best an estimate, subjective in nature, reflecting the worth that the parties themselves, for myriad reasons, attach to their case.  See Mathewson Corp. v. Allied Marine Indus., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"493607\"><a href=\"/opinion/493607/mathewson-corporation-v-allied-marine-industries-inc-brad-foote-gear/\"><span class=\"volume\">827</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></a></span>, 855 (1st Cir.1987).  It follows inexorably that the settlement value of Depco's claim against E &amp; Y will not be determined by the incidence of rights of contribution alone.  See generally Note, Private Settlement as Alternative Adjudication:  A Rationale for Negotiation Ethics, 18 U.Mich.J.L.Ref. 503, 515 n. 16 (1985) (explaining that one cannot \"presum[e] that projected legal rights are the principal determinants of negotiated agreements....  [O]ther considerations incident to bargaining power, such as relative financial strength and eagerness to avoid trial, are often vitally important to both the process and ultimate content of private settlements\").

Rather, a claim of hardship demands an assessment of the complainant's position in light of all the attendant circumstances.  See State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co. v. Dole, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"477748\"><a href=\"/opinion/477748/state-farm-mutual-automobile-insurance-company-v-elizabeth-dole-secretary/\"><span class=\"volume\">802</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span>, 479 (D.C.Cir.1986) (noting that application of Abbott Labs is not \"a matter of weaving complicated legal distinctions divorced from reality,\" but, rather, requires the exercise of \"practical common sense\") (internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">951</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Here, three facts soften the sharp edges of E &amp; Y's professed hardship, and, therefore, counsel restraint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the contingent nature of E &amp; Y's claim has implications for hardship as well for fitness.  Given the stretched chain of events that must transpire before the Act can harm E &amp; Y, and the speculative nature of many of those events, we remain unconvinced either that E &amp; Y's ability to negotiate is unfairly handicapped or that its ability to settle will be substantially enhanced by an immediate decision about the constitutionality of the Act.  Second, E &amp; Y is not without other options.  Proceedings are underway in the state court that offer a vehicle for the expedited constitutional adjudication that E &amp; Y seeks, unaccompanied by the disadvantages that deter us in this case.  See supra note 10.  E &amp; Y is already a party to the underlying state-court litigation and can, if it chooses to do so, participate in the proceedings before the Rhode Island Supreme Court.  Finally, as some other defendants reportedly have done, E &amp; Y can enter into negotiations with Depco aimed at fashioning a settlement that is contingent on an adjudication of the Act's constitutionality.  See supra note 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the Depco Act does not work a sufficient hardship, gauged by present effects, to justify a finding of ripeness.  Though E &amp; Y may feel some discomfiture over the threatened impairment of its anticipated right to contribution, the burden of which it complains is for the most part indigenous to the litigation process, and, thus, it cannot be made weightless by the desired declaratory relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  E &amp; Y yearns for the blossom when only the bud is ready.  Because its challenge to the constitutionality of the Depco Act satisfies neither the fitness nor the hardship prong of the Abbott Labs test, it is not yet ripe for federal judicial review.  Accordingly, the district court's dismissal of E &amp; Y's complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Rhode Island General Assembly chartered RISDIC in 1969 as a private deposit-insurance corporation.  It began operations in 1971, subject only to state, not federal, regulation.  Depositors tended to view RISDIC as a state-sponsored enterprise, and its proprietors--the banks and credit unions that dealt with it--did nothing to dispel this misconception</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> As of the time the parties' briefs were filed, Depco had managed to repay 93% of the affected depositors and to repay 90% or more of the amounts owed to the remaining depositors</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The statute reads in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>Notwithstanding any provisions of law to the contrary, a person, corporation, or other entity who has resolved its liability to the Rhode Island Depositors' Economic Protection Corporation, the receiver of Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation or the receiver of any state-chartered financial institution in judicially-approved good faith settlement shall not be liable for claims for contribution or equitable indemnity regarding matters addressed in the settlement.  Such settlement does not discharge any other tortfeasors unless its terms so provide, but it reduces the potential liability of such joint tortfeasors by the amount of the settlement.</p>\n        <p>R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 42-116-40 (1993).  The idea behind the statute is scarcely original;  the Depco Act is modeled on the special contribution provisions contained in the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation &amp; Liability Act (CERCLA), see 42 U.S.C. Sec. 9613(f)(2)-(3) (1988);  see also United States v. Cannons Eng'g Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538792\"><a href=\"/opinion/538792/united-states-of-america-v-cannons-engineering-corp-appeal-of-olin-hunt/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 91-92 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining operation of CERCLA contribution provisions).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> E &amp; Y's complaint named Governor Sundlun, Depco, and Depco's executive director as defendants.

Despite their natural imbrication, these asseverations are distinct;  the standing doctrine is concerned with who may bring a particular suit, while the ripeness doctrine is concerned with when a party may bring suit.  Because we hold that the controversy is not ripe, we eschew any consideration of whether E &amp; Y also lacks standing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Judge Boyle also expressed his view that the Depco Act did not comprise a bill of attainder.  See E &amp; <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Y,</span> <span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">716-17</span></span>.

The statute and the rule are functionally equivalent.  See, e.g., 118 E. 60th Owners, Inc. v. Bonner Props., Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">677</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></span>, 205 n. 8 (2d Cir.1982) (treating Rule 57 as implementing the remedy authorized by the Act)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We need not probe this final point, for E &amp; Y has not made a sufficiently strong showing under either of the test's two prongs.  See infra Part IV(C)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> State judicial review is, however, in the offing.  Shortly before we heard oral argument, Depco asked the state superior court to certify questions anent the constitutionality of the Depco Act to the state supreme court.  Depco made the motion in a tort case it had commenced involving the collapse of the Brown University Employees Credit Union, a RISDIC-insured institution.  Over E &amp; Y's objection--E &amp; Y is a third-party defendant in the suit--the superior court granted Depco's motion.  The state supreme court received the certified questions, paired them with a strikingly similar set of constitutional issues limned by the Governor in a pending request for an advisory opinion, see R.I. Const. art.  X, Sec. 3 (authorizing the governor to request such advisory opinions from the state supreme court), and promulgated a consolidated briefing schedule.  Although E &amp; Y correctly maintains that announcing a briefing schedule is not tantamount to reaching the merits of the certified questions, it appears likely that the Rhode Island Supreme Court will soon hear oral arguments</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Depco apparently has reached one settlement that is expressly conditioned on the constitutionality of the Depco Act being upheld by the Rhode Island Supreme Court.  See supra note 10.  In the settlement papers the settling defendants disclaim any wrongdoing, and Depco agrees not to treat the fact of settlement as an admission of liability.  The more widespread this pattern of settlement becomes, the more arduous it will be to fulfill the \"other tortfeasor\" requirement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> E &amp; Y touts Narragansett Tribe, a case in which we found disputed issues ripe, as directly applicable precedent.  We do not agree.  There, unlike in this case, the state's suit fully satisfied the adverseness requirement.  See Narragansett <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195256\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Tribe,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195256/state-of-ri-v-narragansett-tribe/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">692-93</span></a></span>.   Other distinctions abound;  the arguably unripe issues in that case were not of constitutional stature, the public interest favored immediate adjudication, comity was not a problem (as, there, unlike here, the state urged the federal court to proceed), the hardship that would flow from non-adjudication was starkly apparent, and the utility of a prompt decision was more easily discernible</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> The absence of affected parties also has implications for the hardship vel non of denying review, see infra Part IV(C)(2).  Even if E &amp; Y were to prevail in the instant action, it seems likely that settling joint tortfeasors, not parties here, would be entitled to relitigate the Depco Act's constitutionality in defending subsequent contribution actions brought by E &amp; Y.  See NLRB v. Donna-Lee Sportswear Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499439\"><a href=\"/opinion/499439/national-labor-relations-board-v-donna-lee-sportswear-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 33-34 (1st Cir.1987) (explaining requirements for collateral estoppel);  E.W. Audet &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1529643\"><a href=\"/opinion/1529643/ew-audet-sons-inc-v-firemens-fund-ins-co-of-newark/\"><span class=\"volume\">635</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></a></span>, 1186-87 (R.I.1994) (similar;  elucidating Rhode Island law)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> We have discussed only E &amp; Y's challenge to the constitutionality of the Depco Act on its face.  To go further would be supererogatory.  Because the facial challenge is unfit for review, it follows a fortiori that the \"as applied\" challenge to a freshly minted statute that has yet to make its maiden voyage is also unfit</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> It perhaps bears noting that the lack of certitude both helps and hurts E &amp; Y.  On one hand, the uncertainty admittedly generates pressure on E &amp; Y to pay more by way of settlement.  But on the other hand, the uncertainty also encourages Depco to settle for less than it would demand if it knew beyond any peradventure of doubt that the Act would withstand constitutional scrutiny.  By the same token, a resolution of the constitutional question would cut both ways.  If a court upholds the Depco Act, E &amp; Y probably will be faced with the prospect of paying more for a release, whereas, if a court invalidates the Act, E &amp; Y probably will be able to pay less.  This shifting array of possibilities, tilting first in one direction and then in the other, further dilutes E &amp; Y's claim of an intolerable hardship</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Although lack of ripeness is dispositive here, we do not in any way suggest that the lower court's alternate ground for dismissal--abstention--lacks force.  In particular, to the extent that the court's abstention ruling rests on the discretion provided by the Declaratory Judgment Act, see, e.g., El <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583336\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Dia,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/583336/el-dia-inc-v-rafael-hernandez-colon/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">493</span></a></span>-95, it appears fully sustainable.  As we have indicated, the constitutional questions presented by a challenge to the Depco Act are of great import to Rhode Island, and lie at the core of the massive litigation that is proceeding glacially in its court system.  Even if no individual abstention doctrine requires federal courts to forgo review--a matter on which we do not opine--the comity and federalism concerns that animate the various doctrines strongly suggest that dismissal of E &amp; Y's declaratory action mirrors the course of prudence</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
