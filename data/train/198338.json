LARHETTE, ETC., ET AL.,\r\n\n                  Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\r\n\n     [Hon. Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\nStahl, Circuit Judge,\r\nCoffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\nand Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n John Canty on brief pro se.\r\n Philip T. McLaughlin, Attorney General, and Daniel J. Mullen, Senior Assistant Attorney General, on brief for appellees Janis Larhette and Howard Zibel.\r\n James B. Kazan and Normand &amp; Shaughnessy, P.A. on brief for appellees L. David Vincola and N.L. Vincola.\r\n\nFebruary 25, 1999\r\n\n        Per Curiam. Having carefully reviewed the record in\r\nthis case, including the briefs of the parties, we affirm the\r\ndismissal of appellant's claims, although for reasons somewhat\r\ndifferent from those relied upon below.\r\n          First, we find all of Canty's claims for damage\r\nrelief to be barred by the doctrine of Rooker-Feldman.  Each of\r\nthese claims is predicated on an alleged injury which arises\r\nout of Canty's eviction.  Since that eviction was upheld by the\r\njudgment of the state court, Canty's \"federal claim [for damage\r\nrelief] succeeds only to the extent that the state court\r\nwrongly decided the issue before it and hence is \"inextricably\r\nintertwined\" with the state court judgment. Pennzoil Co. v.\r\nTexaco, Inc., 481 U.S. 1, 25 (Marshall, J., concurring); see,\r\ne.g., Garry v. Geils, 82 F.3d 1362, 1367 (7th Cir. 1996)\r\n(\"defendant who has lost in state court and sues in federal\r\ncourt . . . asserts injury at the hands of the court and . . .\r\nsuit therefore is an effort to obtain collateral review\");\r\nHomola v. McNamara, 59 F.3d 647, 651 (7th Cir. 1995) (suit\r\nagainst deputy for enforcing court order is \"just a way to\r\ncontest the order itself\" and thus barred by Rooker-Feldman). \r\n          Arguably, Canty is correct in his contention that his\r\nclaims for declaratory and injunctive relief are general\r\nconstitutional challenges to a state statute and hence not\r\nbarred by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine.  See Schneider v.\r\nColegio de Abogodos de Puerto Rico, 917 F.2d 620, 628 (1st Cir.\r\n1990) (Rooker-Feldman does not bar facial challenges to state\r\nstatutes).  Nevertheless, absent an allegation of injury from\r\nthe eviction--allegations as we have just indicated which are\r\nbarred by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine--Canty fails to show the\r\nconcrete injury necessary to establish his standing to seek\r\ninjunctive or declaratory relief.  See Berner v. Delahanty, 129\r\nF.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1997) (party seeking solely injunctive or\r\ndeclaratory relief only has standing to pursue his claim if he\r\ncan show, inter alia, invasion of legally protected concrete\r\ninterest), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 1305 (1998); see alsoLanders Seed Co., Inc. v. Champaign Nat. Bank, 15 F.3d 729, 732\r\n(7th Cir.) (absent claim for damages, plaintiff lacks standing\r\nto sue for declaratory and injunctive relief; however, pursuing\r\ndamages essentially asks court to invalidate state court\r\njudgment and hence is barred by Rooker-Feldman), cert. denied,\r\n513 U.S. 811 (1994).\r\n          Finally, even if we assume arguendo that Canty was\r\nable to reserve his federal claims in state court under the\r\ndoctrine of England v. Louisiana State Bd. of Medical\r\nExaminers, 375 U.S. 411 (1964), we nonetheless find,\r\nessentially for the reasons given by the court in Szoke v.\r\nCarter, 974 F. Supp. 360, 366 (S.D.N.Y. 1997), that the Englandreservation does not overcome a Rooker-Feldman jurisdictional\r\nbar in this case.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
