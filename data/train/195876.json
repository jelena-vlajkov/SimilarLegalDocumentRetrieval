In 1965,  in line\r                                                    \n\nwith  the  growing  concern  over the  fatal  consequence  of\n\ncontributory  negligence,  the  Maine Legislature  enacted  a\n\nstatute  permitting recovery,  but reduced damages,  in cases\n\nwhere a  plaintiff, though  negligent, was  less so  than the\n\ndefendant.  Me.  Rev. Stat.  Ann. tit. 14,    156.   Although\n\nthere  were  a variety  of  state  statutes  in  effect,  the\n\nLegislature  chose the English  one, see  Wing v.  Morse, 300\r                                                                    \n\nA.2d 491,  497 (Me.  1973), essentially  word  for word,  see\r                                                                         \n\nComparative  Negligence:   Some  New Problems  for the  Maine\r                                                                         \n\nCourts, 18 Me. L. Rev. 65, 76 (1966).  The statute is unique,\r                  \n\nand we are not to look for enlightment to decisions in sister\n\nstates. \n\n          The   facts  are   simple.     Brian  Rodgers,   an\n\nexperienced ATV (all  terrain vehicle)  rider, found  himself\n\nwithout his helmet  at a  popular Maine spot  where a  friend\n\nwith  a three wheel  ATV asked him  to help repair  it.  Some\n\nrepairs  having been  made, plaintiff1  gave it a  trial run.\n\nIt flipped and he  struck his head, receiving brain-crippling\n\ninjuries.   On his motion, liability was tried first, and the\n\njury's answers  to special  questions terminated the  case in\n\ndefendant's favor.  Plaintiff has one basic claim on  appeal.\n\nWe will deal with it  rather than with defendant's contention\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Strictly, Rodgers  is now incompetent and  plaintiffs are\nhis  guardians.  They  are joined by  his wife, individually.\nWe will speak in terms, however, of Rodgers as plaintiff.\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nthat judgment in its favor would have been proper even if the\n\nevidence plaintiff objected to had been excluded.\n\n          For  the  liability  trial,  by  motion  in limine,\n\nplaintiff sought an order excluding testimony that he had not\n\nbeen  wearing  a helmet.    This  was of  importance  because\n\ndefendant had  uncontradicted expert  testimony that,  with a\n\nhelmet, plaintiff's injuries  would have been  insignificant.\n\nPlaintiff's position was that, however much the  absence of a\n\nhelmet may have added to the damages, it was not a fault that\n\ncaused  the  accident,  and  that  under  the  Maine  statute\n\ncomparative fault for the accident itself was the determining\n\nfactor.   The  court ruled  otherwise, and  the evidence  was\n\nsubsequently  admitted.    This was  crucial  because  unless\n\nplaintiff's fault was less than  defendant's he was barred by\n\nthe statute from  recovery.  If  fault was to be  measured by\n\nweighing  responsibility for  damages, as  distinguished from\n\nfor the event, on the uncontradicted evidence, it being clear\n\nthat plaintiff knew  it was best to wear a  helmet, he had no\n\ncase.\n\n          Analysis of the statute persuades us that the court\n\nwas correct.  It provides, in relevant part,\n\n               Where  any  person suffers  death or\n          damage  as  a  result partly  of  his own\n          fault and  partly  of the  fault  of  any\n          other  person  or  persons,  a  claim  in\n          respect of that death or damage shall not\n          be defeated by reason of the fault of the\n          person  suffering  the  damage,  but  the\n          damages  recoverable  in respect  thereof\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n          shall be reduced  to such  extent as  the\n          jury  thinks  just  and equitable  having\n          regard to  the  claimant's share  in  the\n          responsibility for the damage.\n\n               Where damages are recoverable by any\n          person by virtue of this section, subject\n          to  such reduction  as is  mentioned, the\n          court shall instruct the jury to find and\n          record the total damages which would have\n          been recoverable if  the claimant had not\n          been  at fault, and  further instruct the\n          jury  to  reduce  the  total  damages  by\n          dollars and cents, and not by percentage,\n          to the extent deemed just  and equitable,\n          having  regard to the claimant's share in\n          the responsibility for  the damages,  and\n          instruct the jury to return  both amounts\n          with the knowledge that the lesser figure\n          is the final verdict in the case.\n\n               Fault  means  negligence, breach  of\n          statutory duty  or other act  or omission\n          which  gives rise to  a liability in tort\n          or would, apart  from this section,  give\n          rise  to  the  defense   of  contributory\n          negligence.\n\n               If  such claimant  is  found by  the\n          jury to be equally at fault, the claimant\n          shall not recover.\n\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14,   156.\n\n          This  is  a  lengthy   statute.    See,  e.g.,  the\r                                                                   \n\nWisconsin  statute the court quoted in Wing, 300 A.2d at 498.\r                                                       \n\nThe  first consideration that  struck us was  the rigidity of\n\nthe  final, all-important  cut-off paragraph  as against  the\n\nsensitivity of  the language preceding it.   Damage reduction\n\nshall \"not  [be] by  percentage, [but]  to the  extent deemed\n\njust and equitable, having regard to the claimant's  share in\n\nthe responsibility for  the damages,\" but then the blunt cut-\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\noff,  \"If claimant  is  found by  the jury  to be  equally at\n\nfault.\"   The change in tone was apparently felt by the Maine\n\ncourt as well.  It observed, \"This paragraph was not found in\n\nthe original draft of the Bill considered by the  Legislature\n\nand is quite obviously the result of a political compromise.\"\n\nStriking \"at  fault,\" and  substituting \"responsible  for the\n\ndamage  sustained,\"  the  court proceeded  to  interpret  the\n\nparagraph as saying,\n\n          If  in  the  apportionment  process  such\n          claimant  is  found  by the  jury  to  be\n          equally   responsible   for  the   damage\n          sustained  or  more  responsible for  the\n          damage sustained than the  defendant, the\n          claimant shall not recover.\n\nWing, 300 A.2d at 501.\r                \n\n          With the uncontradicted  evidence that  plaintiff's\n\nfailure to wear a helmet was  responsible for essentially all\n\nthe damage sustained, this reading of the statute is fatal to\n\nhis case.   The Wing decision itself  is distinguishable, but\r                                \n\nits  language is  an answer to  all plaintiffs'  claims, writ\n\nlarge; the helmet evidence was admissible on liability.\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \n\n                             -7-\r\r\n",

Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 14, Sec. 156.  Although there were a variety of state statutes in effect, the Legislature chose the English one, see Wing v. Morse, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2285585\"><a href=\"/opinion/2285585/wing-v-morse/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span>, 497 (Me.1973), essentially word for word, see Comparative Negligence:  Some New Problems for the Maine Courts, 18 Me.L.Rev. 65, 76 (1966).  The statute is unique, and we are not to look for enlightenment to decisions in sister states.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are simple.  Brian Rodgers, an experienced ATV (all terrain vehicle) rider, found himself without his helmet at a popular Maine spot where a friend with a three wheel ATV asked him to help repair it.  Some repairs having been made, plaintiff<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> gave it a trial run.  It flipped and he struck his head, receiving brain-crippling injuries.  On his motion, liability was tried first, and the jury's answers to special questions terminated the case in defendant's favor.  Plaintiff has one basic claim on appeal.  We will deal with it rather than with defendant's contention that judgment in its favor would have been proper even if the evidence plaintiff objected to had been excluded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the liability trial, by motion in limine, plaintiff sought an order excluding testimony that he had not been wearing a helmet.  This was of importance because defendant had uncontradicted expert testimony that, with a helmet, plaintiff's injuries would have been insignificant.  Plaintiff's position was that, however much the absence of a helmet may have added to the damages, it was not a fault that caused the accident, and that under the Maine statute comparative fault for the accident itself was the determining factor.  The court ruled otherwise, and the evidence was subsequently admitted.  This was crucial because unless plaintiff's fault was less than defendant's he was barred by the statute from recovery.  If fault was to be measured by weighing responsibility for damages, as distinguished from for the event, on the uncontradicted evidence, it being clear that plaintiff knew it was best to wear a helmet, he had no case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Analysis of the statute persuades us that the court was correct.  It provides, in relevant part,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where any person suffers death or damage as a result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of any other person or persons, a claim in respect of that death or damage shall not be defeated by reason of the fault of the person suffering the damage, but the damages recoverable in respect thereof shall be reduced to such extent as the jury thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant's share in the responsibility for the damage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where damages are recoverable by any person by virtue of this section, subject to such reduction as is mentioned, the court shall instruct the jury to find and record the total damages which would have been recoverable if the claimant had not been at fault, and further instruct the jury to reduce the total damages by dollars and cents, and not by percentage, to the extent deemed just and equitable, having regard to the claimant's share in the responsibility for the damages, and instruct the jury to return both amounts with the knowledge that the lesser figure is the final verdict in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fault means negligence, breach of statutory duty or other act or omission which gives rise to a liability in tort or would, apart from this section, give rise to the defense of contributory negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If such claimant is found by the jury to be equally at fault, the claimant shall not recover.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 14, Sec. 156.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a lengthy statute.  See, e.g., the Wisconsin statute the court quoted in <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2285585\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Wing,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2285585/wing-v-morse/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span>.   The first consideration that struck us was the rigidity of the final, all-important cut-off paragraph as against the sensitivity of the language preceding it.  Damage reduction shall \"not [be] by percentage, [but] to the extent deemed just and equitable, having regard to the claimant's share in the responsibility for the damages,\" but then the blunt cut-off, \"If claimant is found by the jury to be equally at fault.\"   The change in tone was apparently felt by the Maine court as well.  It observed, \"This paragraph was not found in the original draft of the Bill considered by the Legislature and is quite obviously the result of a political compromise.\"   Striking \"at fault,\" and substituting \"responsible for the damage sustained,\" the court proceeded to interpret the paragraph as saying,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>If in the apportionment process such claimant is found by the jury to be equally responsible for the damage sustained or more responsible for the damage sustained than the defendant, the claimant shall not recover.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2285585\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Wing,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2285585/wing-v-morse/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the uncontradicted evidence that plaintiff's failure to wear a helmet was responsible for essentially all the damage sustained, this reading of the statute is fatal to his case.  The Wing decision itself is distinguishable, but its language is an answer to all plaintiffs' claims, writ at large;  the helmet evidence was admissible on liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Strictly, Rodgers is now incompetent and plaintiffs are his guardians.  They are joined by his wife, individually.  We will speak in terms, however, of Rodgers as plaintiff</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
