Tamuleviz, Assistant  United States Attorneys, on brief\r                                \r\nfor appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.   Petitioner Vincent  J. Piccirilli  appeals\r                           \r\n\nthe  district court  denial of  his  motion to  vacate and/or\r\n\ncorrect judgment, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   2255.  We affirm.\r\n\n     Petitioner  contends first  that  his fine  for cost  of\r\n\nincarceration,  pursuant to  U.S.S.G.     5K1.2(i),  and  the\r\n\ninterest assessed on that fine should be modified because the\r\n\nfine  imposed exceeds the actual cost of his confinement.  In\r\n\nfact, a fine imposed pursuant  to section 5K1.2(i) is  \"meant\r\n\nto penalize . . . criminal  actions, not to pay the bills [of\r\n\nthe  prisoner].\"   United  States v. Price,  65 F.3d 903, 908\r                                                      \r\n\nn.7 (11th Cir.  1995).  While based on a  general estimate of\r\n\nthe costs  of confining a  prisoner, the fine  serves several\r\n\npurposes  beyond   the  recoupment   of  expenses,   such  as\r\n\ncompensating victims of crime,  providing for just punishment\r\n\nproportional to the seriousness  of the offense and deterring\r\n\nothers from similar conduct.

However, since  his offense was  committed between\r\n\nDecember 31, 1984  and November 1,  1987, the district  court\r\n\nwas correct  in assessing  interest pursuant to  the Criminal\r\n\nEnforcement  Act of  1984, 18  U.S.C.    3565(b)(1) (repealed\r\n\n1987).  See United States v. Chapdelaine, 23 F.3d 11, 13 (1st\r                                                    \r\n\nCir. 1994);  United States v.
