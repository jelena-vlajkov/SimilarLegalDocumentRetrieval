On March 20, 1992,\n\nthe  parties  entered into  an  equipment purchase  agreement\n\nunder which  Elmendorf agreed  to purchase computer  hardware\n\nand  software at a price of $120,000.  Elmendorf paid $84,000\n\nin  advance, leaving a balance due of $36,000.  The equipment\n\nfailed  to  perform  to  its   satisfaction,  and  Elmendorf,\n\nclaiming ongoing damage to  its business as a result  of this\n\nfailure, refused to pay.\n\n          A.   The Illinois Action\r                      A.   The Illinois Action\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          On  November  25, 1992,  Screen sued  Elmendorf for\n\n$36,000 in the Circuit  Court of Cook County, Illinois.   The\n\nsummons and complaint in that case were served on Elmendorf's\n\npresident  on  December  3,  1992.    Instead  of  answering,\n\nElmendorf filed a  limited appearance.  On  February 2, 1993,\n\nElmendorf moved to dismiss  for want of personal jurisdiction\n\nand,  after briefing  and argument,  the Cook  County Circuit\n\nCourt  allowed  Elmendorf's  motion  on  May  17,  1993,  and\n\ndismissed Screen's action for want of  personal jurisdiction.\n\nWhile  the  court modified  its order  on  June 8,  1993, the\n\ndismissal  remained.     Screen  appealed  to   the  Illinois\n\nAppellate Court,  seeking to overturn the  dismissal, on July\n\n8, 1993.\n\n          The parties  thereupon engaged in a  war of motions\n\nin the appellate forum.  On October 14, 1993, Screen  filed a\n\nmotion for  stay of  proceedings to  amend record on  appeal,\n\nwhich included  a  request for  additional time  to file  its\n\nbrief.   The appellate court  denied that motion  in February\n\n1994.   Elmendorf, having  strongly opposed Screen's  motion,\n\nfiled  its own motion for  leave to supplement  the record on\n\nMarch 24, 1994, requesting additional time to file its brief.\n\nAfter  the  appellate  court's  disposition of  this  motion,\n\nElmendorf  moved for  clarification on  May 11,  1994.   That\n\nmotion  was allowed  on  August 10,  1994,  with yet  another\n\nextension  of time  for  Elmendorf to  file  its brief.    On\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nSeptember  16,  1994, Elmendorf  filed  a  third request  for\n\nadditional  time to file  its brief because  its attorney was\n\npreparing for  another trial and  lacked the time  to prepare\n\nits brief.  Insofar as we are aware, the appeal has yet to be\n\ndecided.\n\n          B.   The Puerto Rico Action\r                      B.   The Puerto Rico Action\n\n          On January  15, 1993, two months  after Screen sued\n\nElmendorf in Illinois, and a few weeks before Elmendorf moved\n\nto dismiss that action, Elmendorf sued Screen in the Superior\n\nCourt of Puerto  Rico, San Juan  Part, alleging, inter  alia,\r                                                                        \n\nbreach of  contract, false  advertising,  and fraud  stemming\n\nfrom  the same  equipment  purchase agreement  which was  the\n\nsubject of  the Illinois  litigation.  Elmendorf  requested a\n\ndeclaration that the agreement was  null and void, damages in\n\nthe amount  of $684,700  plus interest, and  reimbursement of\n\nthe  $84,000 advance payment.  Screen was not served with the\n\nsummons  and complaint in  the Puerto Rico  action until June\n\n14, 1993,  one week  after the  Cook  County Circuit  Court's\n\namended dismissal of the Illinois action for want of personal\n\njurisdiction.\n\n          On   July   13,   1993,   alleging   diversity   of\n\ncitizenship,  Screen removed  the Puerto  Rico action  to the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.\n\nOn September 8, 1993, Screen moved to dismiss and/or stay the\n\nPuerto Rico federal proceedings citing principles established\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nby  the Supreme  Court in  Colorado River  Water Conservation\r                                                                         \n\nDistrict v. United States, 424 U.S. 800 (1976) and subsequent\r                                     \n\ncases.   This motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who,\n\non October 12, 1993, and in the absence of any  opposition by\n\nElmendorf,  recommended  a  stay of  proceedings  pending the\n\noutcome  of the  Illinois  litigation.   Elmendorf filed  its\n\nopposition on  October 15, 1993, apparently  before receiving\n\nword of the magistrate judge's  decision, and on October  21,\n\n1993, also filed objections  to the magistrate judge's report\n\nand recommendations, along with  an explanation for the delay\n\nin  filing its opposition.   The district  court referred the\n\nmatter to  the magistrate judge for  reconsideration in light\n\nof Elmendorf's objections.\n\n          On  April 8,  1994, the  magistrate judge  issued a\n\nsecond report,  again recommending  a stay.   Elmendorf filed\n\nobjections to this  second report on April 25, 1994.1  On May\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Screen states in its brief  that \"it is unclear  whether\"\nElmendorf's  objections  to  the  April  8,  1994  magistrate\njudge's report,  filed on April  25, 1994, were  filed within\nthe  10-day  period  required  by 28  U.S.C.     636(b)(1)(C)\n(1988).    This  seems   to  suggest  that  we   should  deem\nElmendorf's appeal waived.  See, e.g., Henley Drilling Co. v.\r                                                                      \nMcGee, 36 F.3d 143, 150-51 (1st Cir. 1994) (failure to object\r                 \nwithin     636(b)(1)(C)'s  ten-day period  waives  claim  for\npurposes of appellate review); Fed.  R. Civ. P. 72(b) (same).\nHowever, it  appears that Elmendorf's objections  were timely\nfiled.  See Fed. R.  Civ. P. 72(b) (allowing service  by mail\r                       \nof  magistrate's report);  Fed.  R.  Civ.

A judge of  the court\n          shall make  a  de novo  determination  of\n          those portions of the report or specified\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nThe district court's order of May 5, 1994 states, \"The Court,\n\nhaving reviewed the conclusions of the U.S. Magistrate in the\n\ntwo Report and Recommendations filed in this case, finds that\n\nhis decisions  are warranted  in  law and  fact.\"   Elmendorf\n\nargues  that  this statement  is  inconsistent  with    636's\n\nrequirement.\n\n          Elmendorf has called no  authority to our attention\n\nholding that, in order to demonstrate compliance with   636's\n\nde  novo  review  requirement,  a district  court  must  make\r                    \n\nfindings and rulings of its own rather than adopting those of\n\nthe magistrate  judge.   The statute authorizes  the district\n\ncourt  to adopt  in  whole as  well as  in part  the proposed\n\nfindings or recommendations of  the magistrate judge.  Where,\n\nas  here,  the  magistrate  judge decided  on  an  undisputed\n\nfactual record, the district court was certainly not required\n\nto  rehash the magistrate judge's reasoning.  The role of the\n\nmagistrate judge is \"to  relieve courts of unnecessary work.\"\n\nHenley  Drilling Co.  v.

Another\n\nfactor,  mentioned but not applied in Moses H.

The  Court  spoke of  the \"virtually  unflagging\n\nobligation of the federal courts to exercise the jurisdiction\n\ngiven  them,\" 424 U.S. at 817, and cautioned that \"[o]nly the\n\nclearest  of justifications will  warrant dismissal,\"  id. at\r                                                                      \n\n819.   The weight a  court should give  any single factor may\n\nvary greatly depending on  the case, and \"[n]o one  factor is\n\nnecessarily  determinative;  a carefully  considered judgment\n\ntaking  into   account  both   the  obligation   to  exercise\n\njurisdiction  and  the  combination  of  factors  counselling\n\nagainst  that exercise  is  required,\" id.  at  818-19.

Ct.  1674 (1992).  In  a discussion which\n\nconcluded that it made no  difference in this context whether\n\nthe  district court  ordered a stay  or dismissal,  the Court\n\nemphasized the limits of this discretion, saying:\n\n          When a district  court decides to dismiss\n          or   stay   under   Colorado  River,   it\r                                                         \n          presumably  concludes  that the  parallel\n          state-court   litigation   will   be   an\n          adequate  vehicle  for  the complete  and\n          prompt resolution of  the issues  between\n          the parties.  If there is any substantial\n          doubt as  to this, it would  be a serious\n          abuse of discretion to grant the stay  or\n          dismissal at all.\n\nMoses H. Cone, 460 U.S at 28.\r                         \n\n          B.   The Magistrate Judge's Recommendation\r                      B.   The Magistrate Judge's Recommendation\n\n          The   magistrate   judge's   second    report   and\n\nrecommendation considered Colorado River, reiterating rightly\r                                                    \n\nthat the balance  in any  decision to stay  or dismiss  under\n\nthat doctrine  should be  \"heavily weighted  in favor  of the\n\nexercise of jurisdiction.\"   The magistrate judge nonetheless\n\nfelt that a stay was appropriate here:\n\n          In this case, plaintiff is not seeking to\n          obtain possession of a res.  The evidence\n          and witnesses are split  between Illinois\n          and Puerto  Rico.   No one forum  is more\n          convenient  for both parties  at the same\n          time.     If  this  court  exercises  its\n          jurisdiction,  the  two parties  would be\n          litigating  very  similar  issues in  two\n          separate  forums.  The Illinois court was\n          the first to  assume jurisdiction.  Since\n          the  purchase  agreement entered  into by\n          the parties provides for  the application\n          of  Illinois   law,  it  would   be  more\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          appropriate  for  the  Illinois court  to\n          interpret it.   In  sum, the totality  of\n          the circumstances favors the stay pending\n          resolution of the Illinois litigation.\n\nId.  at 3.   As the district court  adopted this analysis, we\r               \n\nfocus on the magistrate judge's reasoning.\n\n                             IV.\r                                         IV.\n\n          In the  first three sentences  of the  above-quoted\n\nreasoning, the magistrate judge concluded that the factors he\n\nwas considering favored neither party.  We have no difficulty\n\nwith the magistrate judge's assessment of those three items.\n\n          The magistrate judge went  on to conclude, however,\n\nthat the next three  factors weighed in favor of  staying the\n\nfederal action so that Screen  could go forward in  Illinois.\n\nWe disagree.  In  our view, the magistrate judge did not give\n\nappropriate attention to the fact that, at the time the issue\n\nof a stay  was before  the district court  (indeed, up  until\n\nnow), the Illinois action consisted of no more than a pending\n\nappeal  from the  order  of  the  Cook County  Circuit  Court\n\ndismissing  the  action for  lack  of  personal jurisdiction.\n\nThis  was  not a  case where  the  parallel state  action was\n\nstrongly underway, making it perhaps reasonable, depending on\n\nthe  facts, to  await the  outcome in  the state  case before\n\nproceeding in the federal  court.  Here, if the  Cook Country\n\nCircuit Court's  dismissal for lack of  personal jurisdiction\n\nshould  be affirmed  by the  Illinois Appellate  Court, there\n\nwill  be left in existence no state action whatever; while if\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nthe lower court's dismissal should be reversed on appeal, the\n\nparties  will merely  be back  at the  very beginning  of the\n\nprocess of litigating the merits of their controversy.  Under\n\nsuch  circumstances, the  federal diversity action  in Puerto\n\nRico,   which   was   not   encumbered   by   any   threshold\n\njurisdictional question,  was the more  immediately available\n\nvehicle for litigating the dispute.\n\n          The  magistrate  judge said  that  if  the district\n\ncourt action  were allowed to proceed, \"the two parties would\n\nbe litigating  very similar  issues in two  separate forums.\"\n\nBut this description suggests a parallelism that did not then\n\nexist, given  that the  Illinois case  had been  dismissed on\n\njurisdictional  grounds,  leaving  only an  appeal  from  the\n\ndismissal.  Only if  plaintiffs were to win the  appeal would\n\nthe Illinois  proceedings become  truly parallel to  those in\n\nthe federal  district court.   By then,  were it not  for the\n\nstay,  the district court in  Puerto Rico might  be well into\n\nthe merits of the controversy.  To be sure, calling a halt to\n\nthe federal case would permit the parties to devote all their\n\nenergies  to the  battle  over jurisdiction  in the  Illinois\n\nappellate  court,  and,  depending on  the  outcome,  perhaps\n\neventually to litigate their  dispute in the Illinois circuit\n\ncourt.  But forcing the plaintiff in the federal  case to sit\n\non its hands for so long is not consonant with Colorado River\r                                                                         \n\nand  its  progeny, which  describe  the  balance as  \"heavily\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nweighted  in  favor  of   the  exercise  of  [federal  court]\n\njurisdiction.  Moses H. Cone,  460 U. S. at 16.   Those cases\r                                        \n\nrequire   an  affirmative   showing   of  \"the   clearest  of\n\njustifications,\"  Colorado River,  424 U.S.  at 819,  or some\r                                            \n\n\"exceptional basis,\" before a  federal court properly  defers\n\nto a state court proceeding.

Watler, 931 F.2d 140,\r                                                          \n\n146 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          Here, given the problem with  the state proceedings\n\nwe  have mentioned,  we cannot  discern an  exceptional basis\n\nclearly favoring  federal court deference.   Screen's primary\n\nargument  to the district court  was that to  proceed in both\n\ncourts would entail a duplication of \"the costs and delays of\n\nlitigation.\"    Duplication,  standing alone,  is  rarely  an\n\nexceptional basis  that warrants a  stay or dismissal  of the\n\nfederal action.   Rojas-Hernandez v. Puerto  Rico Elec. Power\r                                                                         \n\nAuth., 925 F.2d  492, 496 (1st Cir. 1991).  But even assuming\r                 \n\nduplication were  an important concern, the  cure is scarcely\n\nto  abandon a viable federal forum in favor of a questionable\n\nstate one.\n\n          Nor are  we impressed with Screen's  argument that,\n\nif  forced to proceed in  the federal action  in Puerto Rico,\n\nits  state claim will be  subject to dismissal  because of an\n\nIllinois procedural rule providing for dismissal \"where there\n\nis another  action pending between  the same parties  for the\n\nsame cause.\"   Whatever the  force of this  argument in  some\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\ndifferent  factual  context,  we see  no  good  reason for  a\n\nfederal  court to  defer  to a  problematic state  proceeding\n\nmerely because the existence of the federal case may give the\n\nstate courts some further reason to dismiss the state action.\n\nIndeed,  if Screen's  argument  is  correctly  premised,  the\n\nduplication of  proceedings which worries Screen  will cease.\n\nAnd,  of course, Screen  is free to  assert its claim  to the\n\nbalance  due  under the  equipment  purchase  agreement as  a\n\ncounterclaim in the federal action, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 13.  \r                                                   \n\n          We further  disagree that deference  should be paid\n\nto the Illinois court simply because that court was the first\n\n\"to assume jurisdiction.\"   It is true the Illinois  case was\n\nfiled first.   But soon after the Illinois case was filed, it\n\nwas dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, and that was\n\nthe posture of events when the federal court decided the stay\n\nmotion.   In such circumstances, it is hard to understand why\n\nthe mere fact of priority in filing would be a point in favor\n\nof a stay.  To be sure, if jurisdiction were found on appeal,\n\nthe Illinois case could eventually go  forward on the merits.\n\nBut in Moses  H. Cone  the Supreme Court  indicated that  the\r                                 \n\norder in  which jurisdiction  was taken  is not  a mechanical\n\nconcept automatically favoring the party who files first, but\n\nrather  a concept  that  favors the  case  that is  the  more\n\nadvanced at  the time the  Colorado River balancing  is being\r                                                     \n\ndone.  Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 21.   Courts are instructed\r                                \n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nby  the Supreme Court to measure  which action    the suit in\n\nthe federal court or that  in the state court    is  the more\n\nadvanced in a \"pragmatic, flexible manner, with a view to the\n\nrealities of the case at hand.\"  Id.  Here  the dismissal for\r                                                \n\nlack of personal  jurisdiction in the Illinois  case made the\n\nfederal action  the front-runner.   Hence, having  regard for\n\n\"the  realities of the case at hand,\" the Illinois action did\n\nnot enjoy priority  in time  over the federal  case, and  the\n\nmagistrate  judge erred in citing this factor as a reason for\n\nthe stay.  \n\n          The  magistrate judge  was also impressed  with the\n\nfact  that Illinois  law  is likely  to  be involved  in  the\n\npresent contract  dispute.  We will concede  the expertise of\n\nan Illinois court in its own law, and that federal law is not\n\nin  issue here,  but we do  not believe  that this  factor is\n\nentitled  to  much  weight  for present  purposes.    Nothing\n\nsuggests that the parties' claims present particularly novel,\n\nunusual  or  difficult  questions  of  legal  interpretation.\n\nFederal courts are used to researching  and analyzing the law\n\nof different  jurisdictions.   The federal district  court in\n\nPuerto  Rico will be able to apply Illinois law to the extent\n\nrequired.   See Gonzalez  v. Cruz,  926 F.2d  1, 5  (1st Cir.\r                                             \n\n1991)  (\"The  mere  fact that  the  outcome  of  the case  is\n\ngoverned by state law  does not warrant dismissal     to hold\n\notherwise would  undermine the  purpose and reach  of federal\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\ndiversity jurisdiction.\"); Rojas-Hernandez,  925 F.2d at  496\r                                                      \n\n(reversing  a  stay  where the  issues  of  state  law to  be\n\nconsidered by  the federal court were  \"neither unsettled nor\n\ncomplex\").    \n\n          A further  factor, which  the magistrate judge  did\n\nnot mention, and which strongly counsels against a stay here,\n\nis  whether  the  state  forum  can  adequately  protect  the\n\nparties' rights.   Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 26.3  Given the\r                                            \n\nfact that when the district court was considering the request\n\nfor a stay,  it was entirely  uncertain whether the  Illinois\n\ncourts had jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, the\n\nprotection available  to the parties' rights  in Illinois was\n\nnecessarily  problematic.    The  Illinois  court  would,  of\n\ncourse, be  as well able as  the federal court to  dispose of\n\nthe case if  it had  jurisdiction, but unless  and until  the\n\npersonal   jurisdictional  question   was  resolved   by  the\n\nappellate  court  in  favor  of  plaintiff,  the  utility  of\n\nIllinois as a forum remained in grave doubt.4 \n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  As we have  previously mentioned, the  Court in Moses  H.\r                                                                         \nCone also spoke of the need to find \"that the parallel state-\r                \ncourt litigation will be an adequate vehicle for the complete\nand  prompt resolution  of the  issues between  the parties.\"\n460 U.S. at 28.  Should there be doubt of this,  it would be,\nthe  Court said, \"a serious  abuse of discretion\"  to grant a\nstay.  Id.\r                      \n\n4.  We also note Screen's  contention that the federal action\nis vexatious and reactive.  See Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 17\r                                                         \nn.20; Fuller, 782  F.2d at 308-310.  We do  not find merit in\r                        \nthis argument.  Elmendorf's action was filed two months after\nScreen's, but  Elmendorf waited to serve  process upon Screen\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\n          We  hold,  therefore,  that  the   balance  of  the\n\nColorado   River  factors  favored   denying  the  stay,  and\r                            \n\ncertainly did  not favor granting  it, having regard  for the\n\nuncertain status of the Illinois litigation.

America (East), Inc.'s motion to stay a pending federal diversity action until similar litigation in the state courts of Illinois is concluded.  The United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico accepted the recommendation of the magistrate judge that a stay was justified under principles declared in Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976).  We vacate the stay and remand for proceedings in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case arises out of a dispute between Elmendorf Grafica, Inc., a Puerto Rico corporation with its principal place of business in Puerto Nuevo, Puerto Rico, and D.S. America (East), Inc., d/b/a Screen (East) (hereinafter \"Screen\"), an Illinois corporation with its principal place of business in Rolling Meadows, Illinois.  On March 20, 1992, the parties entered into an equipment purchase agreement under which Elmendorf agreed to purchase computer hardware and software at a price of $120,000.  Elmendorf paid $84,000 in advance, leaving a balance due of $36,000.  The equipment failed to perform to its satisfaction, and Elmendorf, claiming ongoing damage to its business as a result of this failure, refused to pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Illinois Action</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 25, 1992, Screen sued Elmendorf for $36,000 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois.  The summons and complaint in that case were served on Elmendorf's president on December 3, 1992.  Instead of answering, Elmendorf filed a limited appearance.  On February 2, 1993, Elmendorf moved to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction and, after briefing and argument, the Cook County Circuit Court allowed Elmendorf's motion on May 17, 1993, and dismissed Screen's action for want of personal jurisdiction.  While the court modified its order on June 8, 1993, the dismissal remained.  Screen appealed to the Illinois Appellate Court, seeking to overturn the dismissal, on July 8, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties thereupon engaged in a war of motions in the appellate forum.  On October 14, 1993, Screen filed a motion for stay of proceedings to amend record on appeal, which included a request for additional time to file its brief.  The appellate court denied that motion in February 1994.  Elmendorf, having strongly opposed Screen's motion, filed its own motion for leave to supplement the record on March 24, 1994, requesting additional time to file its brief.  After the appellate court's disposition of this motion, Elmendorf moved for clarification on May 11, 1994.  That motion was allowed on August 10, 1994, with yet another extension of time for Elmendorf to file its brief.  On September 16, 1994, Elmendorf filed a third request for additional time to file its brief because its attorney was preparing for another trial and lacked the time to prepare its brief.  Insofar as we are aware, the appeal has yet to be decided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Puerto Rico Action</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 15, 1993, two months after Screen sued Elmendorf in Illinois, and a few weeks before Elmendorf moved to dismiss that action, Elmendorf sued Screen in the Superior Court of Puerto Rico, San Juan Part, alleging, inter alia, breach of contract, false advertising, and fraud stemming from the same equipment purchase agreement which was the subject of the Illinois litigation. Elmendorf requested a declaration that the agreement was null and void, damages in the amount of $684,700 plus interest, and reimbursement of the $84,000 advance payment.  Screen was not served with the summons and complaint in the Puerto Rico action until June 14, 1993, one week after the Cook County Circuit Court's amended dismissal of the Illinois action for want of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 13, 1993, alleging diversity of citizenship, Screen removed the Puerto Rico action to the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.  On September 8, 1993, Screen moved to dismiss and/or stay the Puerto Rico federal proceedings citing principles established by the Supreme Court in Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976) and subsequent cases.  This motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who, on October 12, 1993, and in the absence of any opposition by Elmendorf, recommended a stay of proceedings pending the outcome of the Illinois litigation.  Elmendorf filed its opposition on October 15, 1993, apparently before receiving word of the magistrate judge's decision, and on October 21, 1993, also filed objections to the magistrate judge's report and recommendations, along with an explanation for the delay in filing its opposition.  The district court referred the matter to the magistrate judge for reconsideration in light of Elmendorf's objections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 8, 1994, the magistrate judge issued a second report, again recommending a stay.  Elmendorf filed objections to this second report on April 25, 1994.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  On May 5, 1994, the district court issued an order adopting the magistrate judge's conclusions and ordering a stay of the proceedings.  Elmendorf appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. A Preliminary Matter</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Elmendorf argues that the district court failed to perform a de novo review of the magistrate judge's proposed findings, as required by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(1)(C) (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The district court's order of May 5, 1994 states, \"The Court, having reviewed the conclusions of the U.S. Magistrate in the two Report and Recommendations filed in this case, finds that his decisions are warranted in law and fact.\"   Elmendorf argues that this statement is inconsistent with Sec. 636's requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Elmendorf has called no authority to our attention holding that, in order to demonstrate compliance with Sec. 636's de novo review requirement, a district court must make findings and rulings of its own rather than adopting those of the magistrate judge.  The statute authorizes the district court to adopt in whole as well as in part the proposed findings or recommendations of the magistrate judge.  Where, as here, the magistrate judge decided on an undisputed factual record, the district court was certainly not required to rehash the magistrate judge's reasoning.  The role of the magistrate judge is \"to relieve courts of unnecessary work.\"  Henley Drilling Co. v. McGee, 36 F.3d 143, 151 (1st Cir.1994), quoting Park Motor Mart, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 616 F.2d 603, 605 (1st Cir.1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Colorado River Doctrine</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court in Colorado River established a narrow basis for district courts to stay or dismiss federal lawsuits in deference to parallel state proceedings.  The Court held that, in \"exceptional\" circumstances, 424 U.S. at 818, 96 S.Ct. at 1246-47, a federal court could decline jurisdiction based on \" 'considerations of \"[w]ise judicial administration, giving regard to conservation of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of litigation,\" ' \" Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 15, 103 S.Ct. 927, 936, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983) (quoting Colorado River, 424 U.S. at 817, 96 S.Ct. at 1246 (quoting Kerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O-Two Fire Equip.  Co., 342 U.S. 180, 183, 72 S.Ct. 219, 221, 96 L.Ed. 200 (1952))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court in Colorado River mentioned four illustrative factors for determining whether \"exceptional circumstances\" exist:  (1) whether either court has assumed jurisdiction over a res;  (2) the inconvenience of the federal forum;  (3) the desirability of avoiding piecemeal litigation, and (4) the order in which the forums obtained jurisdiction.  In Moses H. Cone, the Court added two additional factors:  (5) whether state or federal law controls, and (6) the adequacy of the state forum to protect the parties' rights.  Another factor, mentioned but not applied in Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 17 n. 20, 103 S.Ct. at 937 n. 20, and counted by some courts, is the vexatious or reactive nature of the federal lawsuit, see, e.g., Fuller Co. v. Ramon I. Gil, Inc., 782 F.2d 306, 308-10 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Colorado River, the Supreme Court emphasized that the stay or dismissal authorized there should be used sparingly.  The Court spoke of the \"virtually unflagging obligation of the federal courts to exercise the jurisdiction given them,\" 424 U.S. at 817, 96 S.Ct. at 1246, and cautioned that \"[o]nly the clearest of justifications will warrant dismissal,\" id. at 819, 96 S.Ct. at 1247.   The weight a court should give any single factor may vary greatly depending on the case, and \"[n]o one factor is necessarily determinative;  a carefully considered judgment taking into account both the obligation to exercise jurisdiction and the combination of factors counselling against that exercise is required,\" id. at 818-19, 96 S.Ct. at 1246-47.   The district court must weigh the important factors \"with the balance heavily weighted in favor of the exercise of jurisdiction,\" Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 16, 103 S.Ct. at 937.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision whether to surrender jurisdiction is \"necessarily left to the discretion of the district court in the first instance,\" id. at 19, 103 S.Ct. at 938, and the district court's decision may be reversed only for an abuse of that discretion.  Such discretion must be exercised, however, within the constraints of the \"exceptional-circumstances test.\"  Id.;  see also Villa Marina Yacht Sales, Inc. v. Hatteras Yachts, 947 F.2d 529 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 986, 112 S.Ct. 1674, 118 L.Ed.2d 393 (1992).  In a discussion which concluded that it made no difference in this context whether the district court ordered a stay or dismissal, the Court emphasized the limits of this discretion, saying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>When a district court decides to dismiss or stay under Colorado River, it presumably concludes that the parallel state-court litigation will be an adequate vehicle for the complete and prompt resolution of the issues between the parties.  If there is any substantial doubt as to this, it would be a serious abuse of discretion to grant the stay or dismissal at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 28, 103 S.Ct. at 943.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Magistrate Judge's Recommendation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge's second report and recommendation considered Colorado River, reiterating rightly that the balance in any decision to stay or dismiss under that doctrine should be \"heavily weighted in favor of the exercise of jurisdiction.\"   The magistrate judge nonetheless felt that a stay was appropriate here:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>In this case, plaintiff is not seeking to obtain possession of a res.  The evidence and witnesses are split between Illinois and Puerto Rico.  No one forum is more convenient for both parties at the same time.  If this court exercises its jurisdiction, the two parties would be litigating very similar issues in two separate forums.  The Illinois court was the first to assume jurisdiction.  Since the purchase agreement entered into by the parties provides for the application of Illinois law, it would be more appropriate for the Illinois court to interpret it.  In sum, the totality of the circumstances favors the stay pending resolution of the Illinois litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 3, 103 S.Ct. at 930.   As the district court adopted this analysis, we focus on the magistrate judge's reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first three sentences of the above-quoted reasoning, the magistrate judge concluded that the factors he was considering favored neither party.  We have no difficulty with the magistrate judge's assessment of those three items.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge went on to conclude, however, that the next three factors weighed in favor of staying the federal action so that Screen could go forward in Illinois.  We disagree.  In our view, the magistrate judge did not give appropriate attention to the fact that, at the time the issue of a stay was before the district court (indeed, up until now), the Illinois action consisted of no more than a pending appeal from the order of the Cook County Circuit Court dismissing the action for lack of personal jurisdiction.  This was not a case where the parallel state action was strongly underway, making it perhaps reasonable, depending on the facts, to await the outcome in the state case before proceeding in the federal court.  Here, if the Cook Country Circuit Court's dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction should be affirmed by the Illinois Appellate Court, there will be left in existence no state action whatever;  while if the lower court's dismissal should be reversed on appeal, the parties will merely be back at the very beginning of the process of litigating the merits of their controversy.  Under such circumstances, the federal diversity action in Puerto Rico, which was not encumbered by any threshold jurisdictional question, was the more immediately available vehicle for litigating the dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge said that if the district court action were allowed to proceed, \"the two parties would be litigating very similar issues in two separate forums.\"   But this description suggests a parallelism that did not then exist, given that the Illinois case had been dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, leaving only an appeal from the dismissal.  Only if plaintiffs were to win the appeal would the Illinois proceedings become truly parallel to those in the federal district court.  By then, were it not for the stay, the district court in Puerto Rico might be well into the merits of the controversy.  To be sure, calling a halt to the federal case would permit the parties to devote all their energies to the battle over jurisdiction in the Illinois appellate court, and, depending on the outcome, perhaps eventually to litigate their dispute in the Illinois circuit court.  But forcing the plaintiff in the federal case to sit on its hands for so long is not consonant with Colorado River and its progeny, which describe the balance as \"heavily weighted in favor of the exercise of [federal court] jurisdiction.  Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 16, 103 S.Ct. at 937.   Those cases require an affirmative showing of \"the clearest of justifications,\" Colorado River, 424 U.S. at 819, 96 S.Ct. at 1247, or some \"exceptional basis,\" before a federal court properly defers to a state court proceeding. Burns v. Watler, 931 F.2d 140, 146 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, given the problem with the state proceedings we have mentioned, we cannot discern an exceptional basis clearly favoring federal court deference.  Screen's primary argument to the district court was that to proceed in both courts would entail a duplication of \"the costs and delays of litigation.\"   Duplication, standing alone, is rarely an exceptional basis that warrants a stay or dismissal of the federal action.  Rojas-Hernandez v. Puerto Rico Elec. Power Auth., 925 F.2d 492, 496 (1st Cir.1991).  But even assuming duplication were an important concern, the cure is scarcely to abandon a viable federal forum in favor of a questionable state one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor are we impressed with Screen's argument that, if forced to proceed in the federal action in Puerto Rico, its state claim will be subject to dismissal because of an Illinois procedural rule providing for dismissal \"where there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause.\"   Whatever the force of this argument in some different factual context, we see no good reason for a federal court to defer to a problematic state proceeding merely because the existence of the federal case may give the state courts some further reason to dismiss the state action.  Indeed, if Screen's argument is correctly premised, the duplication of proceedings which worries Screen will cease.  And, of course, Screen is free to assert its claim to the balance due under the equipment purchase agreement as a counterclaim in the federal action, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We further disagree that deference should be paid to the Illinois court simply because that court was the first \"to assume jurisdiction.\"   It is true the Illinois case was filed first.  But soon after the Illinois case was filed, it was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, and that was the posture of events when the federal court decided the stay motion.  In such circumstances, it is hard to understand why the mere fact of priority in filing would be a point in favor of a stay.  To be sure, if jurisdiction were found on appeal, the Illinois case could eventually go forward on the merits.  But in Moses H. Cone the Supreme Court indicated that the order in which jurisdiction was taken is not a mechanical concept automatically favoring the party who files first, but rather a concept that favors the case that is the more advanced at the time the Colorado River balancing is being done.  Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 21, 103 S.Ct. at 939-40.   Courts are instructed by the Supreme Court to measure which action--the suit in the federal court or that in the state court--is the more advanced in a \"pragmatic, flexible manner, with a view to the realities of the case at hand.\"  Id.  Here the dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction in the Illinois case made the federal action the front-runner.  Hence, having regard for \"the realities of the case at hand,\" the Illinois action did not enjoy priority in time over the federal case, and the magistrate judge erred in citing this factor as a reason for the stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge was also impressed with the fact that Illinois law is likely to be involved in the present contract dispute.  We will concede the expertise of an Illinois court in its own law, and that federal law is not in issue here, but we do not believe that this factor is entitled to much weight for present purposes.  Nothing suggests that the parties' claims present particularly novel, unusual or difficult questions of legal interpretation.  Federal courts are used to researching and analyzing the law of different jurisdictions.  The federal district court in Puerto Rico will be able to apply Illinois law to the extent required.  See Gonzalez v. Cruz, 926 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1991) (\"The mere fact that the outcome of the case is governed by state law does not warrant dismissal--to hold otherwise would undermine the purpose and reach of federal diversity jurisdiction.\");  Rojas-Hernandez, 925 F.2d at 496 (reversing a stay where the issues of state law to be considered by the federal court were \"neither unsettled nor complex\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A further factor, which the magistrate judge did not mention, and which strongly counsels against a stay here, is whether the state forum can adequately protect the parties' rights.  Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 26, 103 S.Ct. at 942.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Given the fact that when the district court was considering the request for a stay, it was entirely uncertain whether the Illinois courts had jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, the protection available to the parties' rights in Illinois was necessarily problematic.  The Illinois court would, of course, be as well able as the federal court to dispose of the case if it had jurisdiction, but unless and until the personal jurisdictional question was resolved by the appellate court in favor of plaintiff, the utility of Illinois as a forum remained in grave doubt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that the balance of the Colorado River factors favored denying the stay, and certainly did not favor granting it, having regard for the uncertain status of the Illinois litigation.  The exceptional circumstances that Colorado River calls for in order to stay or dismiss an action brought in a federal court, in favor of proceedings in a state tribunal, were not present.  The district court should expeditiously proceed with the action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stay vacated and case remanded to the district court for continued proceedings consistent herewith.

America (East), Inc., d/b/a Screen (East) (hereinafter \"Screen\"), an Illinois corporation with its principal place of business in Rolling Meadows, Illinois.  On March 20, 1992, the parties entered into an equipment purchase agreement under which Elmendorf agreed to purchase computer hardware and software at a price of $120,000.  Elmendorf paid $84,000 in advance, leaving a balance due of $36,000.  The equipment failed to perform to its satisfaction, and Elmendorf, claiming ongoing damage to its business as a result of this failure, refused to pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Illinois Action</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 25, 1992, Screen sued Elmendorf for $36,000 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois.  The summons and complaint in that case were served on Elmendorf's president on December 3, 1992.  Instead of answering, Elmendorf filed a limited appearance.  On February 2, 1993, Elmendorf moved to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction and, after briefing and argument, the Cook County Circuit Court allowed Elmendorf's motion on May 17, 1993, and dismissed Screen's action for want of personal jurisdiction.  While the court modified its order on June 8, 1993, the dismissal remained.  Screen appealed to the Illinois Appellate Court, seeking to overturn the dismissal, on July 8, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties thereupon engaged in a war of motions in the appellate forum.  On October 14, 1993, Screen filed a motion for stay of proceedings to amend record on appeal, which included a request for additional time to file its brief.  The appellate court denied that motion in February 1994.  Elmendorf, having strongly opposed Screen's motion, filed its own motion for leave to supplement the record on March 24, 1994, requesting additional time to file its brief.  After the appellate court's disposition of this motion, Elmendorf moved for clarification on May 11, 1994.  That motion was allowed on August 10, 1994, with yet another extension of time for Elmendorf to file its brief.  On September 16, 1994, Elmendorf filed a third request for additional time to file its brief because its attorney was preparing for another trial and lacked the time to prepare its brief.  Insofar as we are aware, the appeal has yet to be decided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Puerto Rico Action</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 15, 1993, two months after Screen sued Elmendorf in Illinois, and a few weeks before Elmendorf moved to dismiss that action, Elmendorf sued Screen in the Superior Court of Puerto Rico, San Juan Part, alleging, inter alia, breach of contract, false advertising, and fraud stemming from the same equipment purchase agreement which was the subject of the Illinois litigation. Elmendorf requested a declaration that the agreement was null and void, damages in the amount of $684,700 plus interest, and reimbursement of the $84,000 advance payment.  Screen was not served with the summons and complaint in the Puerto Rico action until June 14, 1993, one week after the Cook County Circuit Court's amended dismissal of the Illinois action for want of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 13, 1993, alleging diversity of citizenship, Screen removed the Puerto Rico action to the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.

This motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who, on October 12, 1993, and in the absence of any opposition by Elmendorf, recommended a stay of proceedings pending the outcome of the Illinois litigation.  Elmendorf filed its opposition on October 15, 1993, apparently before receiving word of the magistrate judge's decision, and on October 21, 1993, also filed objections to the magistrate judge's report and recommendations, along with an explanation for the delay in filing its opposition.  The district court referred the matter to the magistrate judge for reconsideration in light of Elmendorf's objections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 8, 1994, the magistrate judge issued a second report, again recommending a stay.  Elmendorf filed objections to this second report on April 25, 1994.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  On May 5, 1994, the district court issued an order adopting the magistrate judge's conclusions and ordering a stay of the proceedings.

A Preliminary Matter</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Elmendorf argues that the district court failed to perform a de novo review of the magistrate judge's proposed findings, as required by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(1)(C) (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The district court's order of May 5, 1994 states, \"The Court, having reviewed the conclusions of the U.S. Magistrate in the two Report and Recommendations filed in this case, finds that his decisions are warranted in law and fact.\"   Elmendorf argues that this statement is inconsistent with Sec. 636's requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Elmendorf has called no authority to our attention holding that, in order to demonstrate compliance with Sec. 636's de novo review requirement, a district court must make findings and rulings of its own rather than adopting those of the magistrate judge.  The statute authorizes the district court to adopt in whole as well as in part the proposed findings or recommendations of the magistrate judge.  Where, as here, the magistrate judge decided on an undisputed factual record, the district court was certainly not required to rehash the magistrate judge's reasoning.  The role of the magistrate judge is \"to relieve courts of unnecessary work.\"  Henley Drilling Co. v.

The evidence and witnesses are split between Illinois and Puerto Rico.  No one forum is more convenient for both parties at the same time.  If this court exercises its jurisdiction, the two parties would be litigating very similar issues in two separate forums.  The Illinois court was the first to assume jurisdiction.  Since the purchase agreement entered into by the parties provides for the application of Illinois law, it would be more appropriate for the Illinois court to interpret it.  In sum, the totality of the circumstances favors the stay pending resolution of the Illinois litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110873\"><a href=\"/opinion/110873/moses-h-cone-memorial-hospital-v-mercury-constr-corp/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 3, </a></span>103 S.Ct. at 930.   As the district court adopted this analysis, we focus on the magistrate judge's reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first three sentences of the above-quoted reasoning, the magistrate judge concluded that the factors he was considering favored neither party.  We have no difficulty with the magistrate judge's assessment of those three items.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge went on to conclude, however, that the next three factors weighed in favor of staying the federal action so that Screen could go forward in Illinois.  We disagree.  In our view, the magistrate judge did not give appropriate attention to the fact that, at the time the issue of a stay was before the district court (indeed, up until now), the Illinois action consisted of no more than a pending appeal from the order of the Cook County Circuit Court dismissing the action for lack of personal jurisdiction.  This was not a case where the parallel state action was strongly underway, making it perhaps reasonable, depending on the facts, to await the outcome in the state case before proceeding in the federal court.  Here, if the Cook Country Circuit Court's dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction should be affirmed by the Illinois Appellate Court, there will be left in existence no state action whatever;  while if the lower court's dismissal should be reversed on appeal, the parties will merely be back at the very beginning of the process of litigating the merits of their controversy.  Under such circumstances, the federal diversity action in Puerto Rico, which was not encumbered by any threshold jurisdictional question, was the more immediately available vehicle for litigating the dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge said that if the district court action were allowed to proceed, \"the two parties would be litigating very similar issues in two separate forums.\"   But this description suggests a parallelism that did not then exist, given that the Illinois case had been dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, leaving only an appeal from the dismissal.  Only if plaintiffs were to win the appeal would the Illinois proceedings become truly parallel to those in the federal district court.  By then, were it not for the stay, the district court in Puerto Rico might be well into the merits of the controversy.  To be sure, calling a halt to the federal case would permit the parties to devote all their energies to the battle over jurisdiction in the Illinois appellate court, and, depending on the outcome, perhaps eventually to litigate their dispute in the Illinois circuit court.  But forcing the plaintiff in the federal case to sit on its hands for so long is not consonant with Colorado River and its progeny, which describe the balance as \"heavily weighted in favor of the exercise of [federal court] jurisdiction.

Screen's primary argument to the district court was that to proceed in both courts would entail a duplication of \"the costs and delays of litigation.\"   Duplication, standing alone, is rarely an exceptional basis that warrants a stay or dismissal of the federal action.  Rojas-Hernandez v. Puerto Rico Elec. Power Auth., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555762\"><a href=\"/opinion/555762/heibert-rojas-hernandez-v-puerto-rico-electric-power-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 496 (1st Cir.1991).  But even assuming duplication were an important concern, the cure is scarcely to abandon a viable federal forum in favor of a questionable state one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor are we impressed with Screen's argument that, if forced to proceed in the federal action in Puerto Rico, its state claim will be subject to dismissal because of an Illinois procedural rule providing for dismissal \"where there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause.\"   Whatever the force of this argument in some different factual context, we see no good reason for a federal court to defer to a problematic state proceeding merely because the existence of the federal case may give the state courts some further reason to dismiss the state action.  Indeed, if Screen's argument is correctly premised, the duplication of proceedings which worries Screen will cease.  And, of course, Screen is free to assert its claim to the balance due under the equipment purchase agreement as a counterclaim in the federal action, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We further disagree that deference should be paid to the Illinois court simply because that court was the first \"to assume jurisdiction.\"   It is true the Illinois case was filed first.  But soon after the Illinois case was filed, it was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, and that was the posture of events when the federal court decided the stay motion.  In such circumstances, it is hard to understand why the mere fact of priority in filing would be a point in favor of a stay.  To be sure, if jurisdiction were found on appeal, the Illinois case could eventually go forward on the merits.  But in Moses H. Cone the Supreme Court indicated that the order in which jurisdiction was taken is not a mechanical concept automatically favoring the party who files first, but rather a concept that favors the case that is the more advanced at the time the Colorado River balancing is being done.  Moses H. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110873\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Cone,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/110873/moses-h-cone-memorial-hospital-v-mercury-constr-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 103 S.Ct. at 939-40.   Courts are instructed by the Supreme Court to measure which action--the suit in the federal court or that in the state court--is the more advanced in a \"pragmatic, flexible manner, with a view to the realities of the case at hand.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110873\"><a href=\"/opinion/110873/moses-h-cone-memorial-hospital-v-mercury-constr-corp/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  Here the </a></span>dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction in the Illinois case made the federal action the front-runner.  Hence, having regard for \"the realities of the case at hand,\" the Illinois action did not enjoy priority in time over the federal case, and the magistrate judge erred in citing this factor as a reason for the stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge was also impressed with the fact that Illinois law is likely to be involved in the present contract dispute.  We will concede the expertise of an Illinois court in its own law, and that federal law is not in issue here, but we do not believe that this factor is entitled to much weight for present purposes.  Nothing suggests that the parties' claims present particularly novel, unusual or difficult questions of legal interpretation.  Federal courts are used to researching and analyzing the law of different jurisdictions.  The federal district court in Puerto Rico will be able to apply Illinois law to the extent required.

Moses H. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110873\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Cone,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/110873/moses-h-cone-memorial-hospital-v-mercury-constr-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 103 S.Ct. at 942.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Given the fact that when the district court was considering the request for a stay, it was entirely uncertain whether the Illinois courts had jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, the protection available to the parties' rights in Illinois was necessarily problematic.  The Illinois court would, of course, be as well able as the federal court to dispose of the case if it had jurisdiction, but unless and until the personal jurisdictional question was resolved by the appellate court in favor of plaintiff, the utility of Illinois as a forum remained in grave doubt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that the balance of the Colorado River factors favored denying the stay, and certainly did not favor granting it, having regard for the uncertain status of the Illinois litigation.  The exceptional circumstances that Colorado River calls for in order to stay or dismiss an action brought in a federal court, in favor of proceedings in a state tribunal, were not present.  The district court should expeditiously proceed with the action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stay vacated and case remanded to the district court for continued proceedings consistent herewith.

Sec. 636(b)(1)(C) (1988).  This seems to suggest that we should deem Elmendorf's appeal waived.  See, e.g., Henley Drilling Co. v.

However, it appears that Elmendorf's objections were timely filed.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b) (allowing service by mail of magistrate's report);  Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a) and (e) (describing method of computing time period under federal rules, and stating that, where period allowed is less than 11 days, intervening Saturdays, Sundays and holidays shall not be counted, and, where service upon a party is to be made by mail, adding three days to the period is allowed)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> 28 U.S.C.

We do not find merit in this argument.  Elmendorf's action was filed two months after Screen's, but Elmendorf waited to serve process upon Screen until after the circuit court's dismissal of the state action for want of personal jurisdiction over Elmendorf.  In these circumstances, Elmendorf's decisions to fight jurisdiction in Illinois and sue in its home court in Puerto Rico were not improper tactics such as to weigh in favor of a stay</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
