He  bases  his  motion  on  appellate\n\nproceedings  in which  he  successfully persuaded  this court  to\n\nvacate   an  order   of  deportation   and  remand   for  further\n\nconsideration.  See Davila-Bardales  v. INS, 27 F.3d 1  (1st Cir.\r                                                     \n\n1994).   Because we find  that the government's  position in this\n\ncourt was substantially justified, we deny the motion.  \n\n                                I\r                                          I\n\n          We  offer  a  succinct  summary of  prior  proceedings,\n\nreferring the reader  who hungers  for a meatier  account to  our\n\nearlier opinion.  \n\n          In  1989,  the Immigration  and  Naturalization Service\n\n(INS)  issued an order  to show cause  why Davila-Bardales should\n\nnot be deported on the ground that he was a Peruvian national who\n\nhad  unlawfully entered  the  United  States without  inspection.\n\nApplicable  INS  regulations prohibit  an immigration  judge (IJ)\n\nfrom   accepting   an   admission   of   deportability  from   an\n\nunrepresented  party  under the  age of  16  unless the  minor is\n\naccompanied by an  adult guardian,  relative, or friend.   See  8\r                                                                        \n\nC.F.R.     242.16(b) (1994).    Nevertheless,  at the  show-cause\n\nhearing  the  IJ asked  petitioner,  then  age  15,  whether  the\n\nallegations in the rule to show cause were true.  The  petitioner\n\nanswered affirmatively.\n\n          The  IJ   also   reviewed  Form   I-213,   a   document\n\nconstituting  a  record  of   an  INS  officer's  interview  with\n\n                                3\r\r\n\npetitioner shortly  after petitioner's  alleged entry.   The form\n\nattributed to petitioner  admissions similar to those  he made in\n\nthe later show-cause  hearing.   The IJ asked  petitioner if  the\n\nstatements  reported in  the  form were  correct, and  petitioner\n\nacknowledged  that they were.   His comments  regarding the form,\n\nand  Form  I-213  itself,  arguably  escaped  the  grasp  of  the\n\naforementioned  regulation,  8  C.F.R.    242.16(b),  because the\n\nstatements were not made as part  of the hearing, but, rather, in\n\ncustodial interrogation outside the IJ's presence.\n\n          The IJ  found petitioner  deportable, and the  Board of\n\nImmigration  Appeals (BIA) affirmed  despite an apparent conflict\n\nwith two unpublished  BIA decisions.  See In  re Garcia, NO. A70-\r                                                                 \n\n006-067,  slip op.

Although  these\n\ndecisions  lacked  precedential  force,  see 8  C.F.R.     3.1(g)\r                                                      \n\n(1994),  they  suggested that  the evidence  related to  the form\n\nshould have been excluded.  See Davila-Bardales, 27 F.3d at 4.\r                                                         \n\n          Petitioner sought  judicial  review.   We  vacated  the\n\norder of deportation because the BIA had not adequately explained\n\nthe apparent inconsistency  between its unpublished  decisions in\n\nGarcia  and Hernandez-Jimenez, on the one  hand, and its decision\r                                       \n\nin  petitioner's  case, on  the  other  hand.

See id.  Shortly thereafter, petitioner\r                                           \n\n                                4\r\r\n\nfiled the instant motion.\n\n                                II\r                                          II\n\n          The  EAJA  permits   a  prevailing  party  to   recover\n\nreasonable counsel fees and expenses incurred in civil litigation\n\nwith  the  government, but  only if  the  government has  taken a\n\nposition  that is  not \"substantially  justified\" and  no special\n\ncircumstance  renders  a fee  award unjust.    See De  Allende v.\r                                                                        \n\nBaker, 891 F.2d 7, 8 (1st Cir. 1989); Sierra Club v. Secretary of\r                                                                           \n\nthe Army, 820 F.2d 513, 516-17 (1st Cir. 1987).\r                  \n\n          The threshold requirement  for access to EAJA  benefits\n\nis  that a  party  prevail in  his  litigation with  the  federal\n\nsovereign.    It is  unclear  whether  petitioner satisfies  this\n\nbenchmark:  it is problematic whether one is a \"prevailing party\"\n\nwithin the meaning of the EAJA merely because he secures a remand\n\nfor  further agency action.   Several cases have  held or implied\n\nthat prevailing party status  is only conferred upon a  party who\n\nwins at  least part of  the ultimate relief  sought.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \n\nHanrahan  v.

Here,  petitioner  has not  yet  obtained any  ultimate\r                                                                           \n\nrelief as the issue of his deportability remains unsettled.\n\n          We are  hesitant to  decide the matter  on this  basis,\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nhowever, as the status  of these cases  has been drawn into  some\n\nquestion by  the Court's recent  opinion in Shalala  v. Schaefer,\r                                                                          \n\n113 S. Ct. 2625, 2631-32 (1993), which held that procurement of a\n\n\"sentence  four\"  remand  in   the  context  of  social  security\n\nlitigation   qualifies  the   putative  benefit-recipient   as  a\n\nprevailing  party.     And,  moreover,  the   record  reveals  an\n\nindependent basis on which the motion can be decided.  Because we\n\nfind  the   government's  position   in  the  present   case  was\n\nsubstantially  justified, see  infra,  we  skirt the  challenging\r                                              \n\nlegal  question  of  whether  petitioner  can  at  this  stage be\n\nconsidered a prevailing party.\n\n          The   question   of   what   constitutes   \"substantial\n\njustification\" has proven to be a vexing one, best addressed on a\n\ncase by case basis.  In Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552 (1988),\r                                                     \n\nthe  Court   noted  that   substantial  justification   does  not\n\nnecessarily  mean  justified  to  a  high  degree,  but,  rather,\n\nrequires  only  that  the  government's  stance  must  have  been\n\n\"justified to a  degree that could satisfy  a reasonable person.\"\n\nId. at  565.  Accordingly, the test  of substantial justification\r             \n\nturns  on whether  the government's  position was  \"reasonable in\n\nboth law  and fact.\"  United  States v. Yoffe, 775  F.2d 447, 449\r                                                       \n\n(1st Cir. 1985).   What is  more, an  unfavorable outcome in  the\n\nunderlying litigation,  by itself, does not  create a presumption\n\nthat the government's  position was not substantially  justified.\n\nSee De Allende, 891 F.2d at 12; Sierra Club, 820 F.2d at 517.\r                                                     \n\n          Frequently,  the issue of  substantial justification is\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nbifurcated so that  an inquiring court  may consider, first,  the\n\nreasonableness of the government's  agency position, and, second,\n\nthe reasonableness of its litigation position.  See, e.g., United\r                                                                           \n\nStates v.  One Parcel of  Real Property, 960  F.2d 200, 209  (1st\r                                                 \n\nCir. 1992).  We eschew such  a bifurcated approach in the instant\n\ncase.   In the first place,  the Supreme Court has  held that the\n\nEAJA does not apply  to civil deportation proceedings  before the\n\nINS,  see Ardestani  v.  INS, 112  S. Ct.  515,  521 (1991),  and\r                                      \n\npetitioner, mindful of  this impediment, has not  sought fees for\n\nproceedings prior to  those conducted  in this court.   Thus  our\n\nanalysis of substantial justification must focus primarily on the\n\nINS's litigation position in this venue as opposed to its conduct\n\nin bringing  the deportation  proceedings and in  considering the\n\npetitioner's admissions during custodial interrogation.   Second,\n\nand relatedly, we have  held that adjudicators, even though  part\n\nof  the Executive Branch, are  exempt from the  provisions of the\n\nEAJA.   See In  re Perry, 882  F.2d 534, 539-41  (1st Cir. 1989).\r                                  \n\nConsequently, our analysis of substantial justification must look\n\nprimarily  from the perspective of  the INS rather  than from the\n\nperspective of the BIA.\n\n                               III\r                                         III\n\n          Applying the  standard we have described,  we find that\n\nthe  government has met its  burden of showing  that its position\n\nwas  substantially justified.  The law concerning the status of a\n\nminor's  admissions  during  interrogation  at  the   border  was\n\ntenebrous  before our decision  in the instant  case, and remains\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nsomewhat murky.  There  was no precedent in this  court regarding\n\nadmissions  of   deportability  by  minors,  and   the  only  BIA\n\ndiscussions of the issue were in unpublished opinions, which have\n\nno  precedential value.  This lack of clarity in the law strongly\n\nsuggests substantial justification for the government's position.\n\nSee De  Allende, 891 F.2d  at 12-13; Mattson  v. Bowen,  824 F.2d\r                                                                \n\n655, 657  (8th Cir. 1987); Martinez v. Secretary of HHS, 815 F.2d\r                                                                 \n\n1381,  1383 (10th  Cir.  1987).    Put  another  way,  since  the\n\npetitioner's statements  seemingly fell outside the  reach of the\n\nonly  applicable  regulation, there  was  a  significant lack  of\n\nguidance  in  the  law,  and  the  government  was  substantially\n\njustified  in adhering to  its position that  the IJ and  the BIA\n\nproperly relied upon the disputed statements.\n\n          This  was especially  true  in the  situation at  hand.\n\nAfter   all,  the  INS  had  good  reason  to  believe  that  the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the  petitioner's statements  supported\n\nthe veracity and reliablilty of the admissions; the transcript of\n\nthe hearings reveals  that petitioner was able  to understand and\n\narticulate answers to the  relatively simple factual questions he\n\nwas asked.  Although  the BIA displayed regrettable inconsistency\n\nin  its   decisions,  the  INS  could   realistically  hope  that\n\npetitioner's statements  would prove admissible in  the end, even\n\nif the statements became subject  to a consistent rule  governing\n\nunaccompanied admissions made during custodial interrogation.\n\n          We  think,  too, that  the posture  of the  case argues\n\ncogently in favor of a finding of substantial justification.  The\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nINS prevailed initially, both  before the IJ and before  the BIA.\n\nIt did  not seek judicial  review, but  came to this  court as  a\n\nrespondent.     While  we  are  not  prepared  to  say  that  the\n\ngovernment,  qua respondent,  may never  be held  responsible for\r                          \n\nfees  under the EAJA if the petitioner prevails, cf. Sierra Club,\r                                                                          \n\n820 F.2d at 519-20 (affirming EAJA award of reasonable attorneys'\n\nfees  in  non-administrative  adjudication, despite  \"evanescent\"\n\ngovernment   victory  in   the   district   court,  because   the\n\ngovernment's legal position was so obviously contrary to existing\n\nlaw), we are very reluctant to criticize the INS for opposing the\n\npetition for review in this court, given that the BIA already had\n\ndecided the case in its favor.

Sec.  2412 (1988).  He bases his motion on appellate proceedings in which he successfully persuaded this court to vacate an order of deportation and remand for further consideration.  See Davila-Bardales v. INS, 27 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1994).  Because we find that the government's position in this court was substantially justified, we deny the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* We offer a succinct summary of prior proceedings, referring the reader who hungers for a meatier account to our earlier opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1989, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) issued an order to show cause why Davila- Bardales should not be deported on the ground that he was a Peruvian national who had unlawfully entered the United States without inspection.  Applicable INS regulations prohibit an immigration judge (IJ) from accepting an admission of deportability from an unrepresented party under the age of 16 unless the minor is accompanied by an adult guardian, relative, or friend.  See 8 C.F.R. Sec. 242.16(b) (1994).  Nevertheless, at the show-cause hearing the IJ asked petitioner, then age 15, whether the allegations in the rule to show cause were true.  The petitioner answered affirmatively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ also reviewed Form I-213, a document constituting a record of an INS officer's interview with petitioner shortly after petitioner's alleged entry.  The form attributed to petitioner admissions similar to those he made in the later show-cause hearing.  The IJ asked petitioner if the statements reported in the form were correct, and petitioner acknowledged that they were.  His comments regarding the form, and Form I-213 itself, arguably escaped the grasp of the aforementioned regulation, 8 C.F.R. Sec. 242.16(b), because the statements were not made as part of the hearing, but, rather, in custodial interrogation outside the IJ's presence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ found petitioner deportable, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed despite an apparent conflict with two unpublished BIA decisions.  See In re Garcia, NO. A70- 006-067, slip op.  (BIA Aug. 17, 1993);  In re Hernandez-Jimenez, No. Anl-gxg-bbw, slip op.  (BIA Nov. 8, 1991).  Although these decisions lacked precedential force, see 8 C.F.R. Sec. 3.1(g) (1994), they suggested that the evidence related to the form should have been excluded.  See Davila-Bardales, 27 F.3d at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner sought judicial review.  We vacated the order of deportation because the BIA had not adequately explained the apparent inconsistency between its unpublished decisions in Garcia and Hernandez-Jimenez, on the one hand, and its decision in petitioner's case, on the other hand.  See id. at 5-6.  Withal, we left open the possibility that the BIA might develop a consistent and principled rule which would sometimes allow the introduction of an unaccompanied minor's statements made during custodial interrogation.  See id.  Shortly thereafter, petitioner filed the instant motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EAJA permits a prevailing party to recover reasonable counsel fees and expenses incurred in civil litigation with the government, but only if the government has taken a position that is not \"substantially justified\" and no special circumstance renders a fee award unjust.  See De Allende v. Baker, 891 F.2d 7, 8 (1st Cir. 1989);  Sierra Club v. Secretary of the Army, 820 F.2d 513, 516-17 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The threshold requirement for access to EAJA benefits is that a party prevail in his litigation with the federal sovereign.  It is unclear whether petitioner satisfies this benchmark:  it is problematic whether one is a \"prevailing party\" within the meaning of the EAJA merely because he secures a remand for further agency action.  Several cases have held or implied that prevailing party status is only conferred upon a party who wins at least part of the ultimate relief sought.  See, e.g., Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U.S. 754, 758-59 (1980) (rejecting prevailing party status under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988 for one who merely obtains vacation of a directed verdict on appeal);  Escobar Ruiz v. INS, 787 F.2d 1294, 1297 (9th Cir. 1986), aff'd, 838 F.2d 1020, 1029 (9th Cir. 1988) (en banc);  see also Texas State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep.  Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 791-92 (1989).  Here, petitioner has not yet obtained any ultimate relief as the issue of his deportability remains unsettled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are hesitant to decide the matter on this basis, however, as the status of these cases has been drawn into some question by the Court's recent opinion in Shalala v. Schaefer, 113 S. Ct. 2625, 2631-32 (1993), which held that procurement of a \"sentence four\" remand in the context of social security litigation qualifies the putative benefit-recipient as a prevailing party.  And, moreover, the record reveals an independent basis on which the motion can be decided.  Because we find the government's position in the present case was substantially justified, see infra, we skirt the challenging legal question of whether petitioner can at this stage be considered a prevailing party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of what constitutes \"substantial justification\" has proven to be a vexing one, best addressed on a case by case basis.  In Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552 (1988), the Court noted that substantial justification does not necessarily mean justified to a high degree, but, rather, requires only that the government's stance must have been \"justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.\"  Id. at 565.  Accordingly, the test of substantial justification turns on whether the government's position was \"reasonable in both law and fact.\"  United States v. Yoffe, 775 F.2d 447, 449 (1st Cir. 1985).  What is more, an unfavorable outcome in the underlying litigation, by itself, does not create a presumption that the government's position was not substantially justified.  See De Allende, 891 F.2d at 12;  Sierra Club, 820 F.2d at 517.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frequently, the issue of substantial justification is bifurcated so that an inquiring court may consider, first, the reasonableness of the government's agency position, and, second, the reasonableness of its litigation position.  See, e.g., United States v. One Parcel of Real Property, 960 F.2d 200, 209 (1st Cir. 1992).  We eschew such a bifurcated approach in the instant case.  In the first place, the Supreme Court has held that the EAJA does not apply to civil deportation proceedings before the INS, see Ardestani v. INS, 112 S. Ct. 515, 521 (1991), and petitioner, mindful of this impediment, has not sought fees for proceedings prior to those conducted in this court.  Thus our analysis of substantial justification must focus primarily on the INS's litigation position in this venue as opposed to its conduct in bringing the deportation proceedings and in considering the petitioner's admissions during custodial interrogation.  Second, and relatedly, we have held that adjudicators, even though part of the Executive Branch, are exempt from the provisions of the EAJA.  See In re Perry, 882 F.2d 534, 539-41 (1st Cir. 1989).  Consequently, our analysis of substantial justification must look primarily from the perspective of the INS rather than from the perspective of the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the standard we have described, we find that the government has met its burden of showing that its position was substantially justified.  The law concerning the status of a minor's admissions during interrogation at the border was tenebrous before our decision in the instant case, and remains somewhat murky.  There was no precedent in this court regarding admissions of deportability by minors, and the only BIA discussions of the issue were in unpublished opinions, which have no precedential value.  This lack of clarity in the law strongly suggests substantial justification for the government's position.  See De Allende, 891 F.2d at 12-13;  Mattson v. Bowen, 824 F.2d 655, 657 (8th Cir. 1987);  Martinez v. Secretary of HHS, 815 F.2d 1381, 1383 (10th Cir. 1987).  Put another way, since the petitioner's statements seemingly fell outside the reach of the only applicable regulation, there was a significant lack of guidance in the law, and the government was substantially justified in adhering to its position that the IJ and the BIA properly relied upon the disputed statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was especially true in the situation at hand.  After all, the INS had good reason to believe that the circumstances surrounding the petitioner's statements supported the veracity and reliablility of the admissions;  the transcript of the hearings reveals that petitioner was able to understand and articulate answers to the relatively simple factual questions he was asked.  Although the BIA displayed regrettable inconsistency in its decisions, the INS could realistically hope that petitioner's statements would prove admissible in the end, even if the statements became subject to a consistent rule governing unaccompanied admissions made during custodial interrogation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think, too, that the posture of the case argues cogently in favor of a finding of substantial justification.  The INS prevailed initially, both before the IJ and before the BIA.  It did not seek judicial review, but came to this court as a respondent.  While we are not prepared to say that the government, qua respondent, may never be held responsible for fees under the EAJA if the petitioner prevails, cf.  Sierra Club, 820 F.2d at 519-20 (affirming EAJA award of reasonable attorneys' fees in non-administrative adjudication, despite \"evanescent\" government victory in the district court, because the government's legal position was so obviously contrary to existing law), we are very reluctant to criticize the INS for opposing the petition for review in this court, given that the BIA already had decided the case in its favor.  Thus, we conclude that the INS's position, though ultimately unsuccessful, was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

Second, and relatedly, we have held that adjudicators, even though part of the Executive Branch, are exempt from the provisions of the EAJA.  See In re Perry, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527778\"><a href=\"/opinion/527778/in-re-stephen-c-perry/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span>, 539-41 (1st Cir. 1989).  Consequently, our analysis of substantial justification must look primarily from the perspective of the INS rather than from the perspective of the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the standard we have described, we find that the government has met its burden of showing that its position was substantially justified.  The law concerning the status of a minor's admissions during interrogation at the border was tenebrous before our decision in the instant case, and remains somewhat murky.  There was no precedent in this court regarding admissions of deportability by minors, and the only BIA discussions of the issue were in unpublished opinions, which have no precedential value.  This lack of clarity in the law strongly suggests substantial justification for the government's position.  See De <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532999\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Allende,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/532999/hortensia-de-allende-v-james-baker-secretary-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>-13;  Mattson v. Bowen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491732\"><a href=\"/opinion/491732/18-socsecrepser-506-unemplinsrep-cch-17473-floyd-mattson/\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span>, 657 (8th Cir. 1987);  Martinez v. Secretary of HHS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"486476\"><a href=\"/opinion/486476/unemplinsrep-cch-16961-jose-f-martinez-v-secretary-of-health-human/\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1381</span></a></span>, 1383 (10th Cir. 1987).  Put another way, since the petitioner's statements seemingly fell outside the reach of the only applicable regulation, there was a significant lack of guidance in the law, and the government was substantially justified in adhering to its position that the IJ and the BIA properly relied upon the disputed statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was especially true in the situation at hand.  After all, the INS had good reason to believe that the circumstances surrounding the petitioner's statements supported the veracity and reliablility of the admissions;  the transcript of the hearings reveals that petitioner was able to understand and articulate answers to the relatively simple factual questions he was asked.  Although the BIA displayed regrettable inconsistency in its decisions, the INS could realistically hope that petitioner's statements would prove admissible in the end, even if the statements became subject to a consistent rule governing unaccompanied admissions made during custodial interrogation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think, too, that the posture of the case argues cogently in favor of a finding of substantial justification.  The INS prevailed initially, both before the IJ and before the BIA.  It did not seek judicial review, but came to this court as a respondent.  While we are not prepared to say that the government, qua respondent, may never be held responsible for fees under the EAJA if the petitioner prevails, cf.  Sierra <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489491\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Club,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/489491/sierra-club-v-secretary-of-the-army-sierra-club-v-secretary-of-the-army/\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">519-20</span> </a></span>(affirming EAJA award of reasonable attorneys' fees in non-administrative adjudication, despite \"evanescent\" government victory in the district court, because the government's legal position was so obviously contrary to existing law), we are very reluctant to criticize the INS for opposing the petition for review in this court, given that the BIA already had decided the case in its favor.  Thus, we conclude that the INS's position, though ultimately unsuccessful, was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Because the government's position was substantially justified within the meaning of the EAJA, petitioner's motion for attorneys' fees is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
