For this\n     reason, we do not refer to the rule in the body of this\n     opinion.   But we note that, in all events, the clerk's\n     refusal to accept the noncompliant motion for filing in\n     this case was backed by the judge's specific order, see\n                                                            \n     Chronology,  supra, at  No.  4, leaving  the record  in\n                       \n     essentially the  same posture as though  the motion had\n     been  received  and  then  stricken.

(Precision)\n\nto  compel arbitration of a  grievance initiated by  the union on\n\nbehalf  of  certain probationary  employees  (all  pilots).   The\n\ndistrict  court  ordered  Precision  to  arbitrate  the  dispute.\n\nPrecision now seeks to test the substance of the district court's\n\norder.   We  do  not  reach that  destination:    the absence  of\n\nappellate jurisdiction defeats the main thrust of the appeal, and\n\nwhat remains does not require us to extend our flight much beyond\n\ntakeoff.\n\n                                I.\n                                  \n\n                           A Chronology\n                                       \n\n          This appeal is enveloped in  a jurisdictional fog.   We\n\nattempt to clear the air by chronicling the events that frame the\n\njurisdictional issue.\n\n               1.August 17, 1993:  The  district court,\n                                \n          acting  on a  motion  for  summary  judgment,\n          entered  a final judgment  in ALPA's favor on\n          count 1 of its complaint.  At  the same time,\n          the court dismissed count 2 of the  complaint\n          for want of subject matter jurisdiction.  The\n          second  part   of   the  court's   order   is\n          immaterial to this appeal.\n\n               2.August 30, 1993:   Precision attempted\n                                \n          to  move for  reconsideration, but  failed to\n          comply  with  an   applicable  local   rule.1\n\n                    \n\n     1District courts are empowered  to make local rules for  the\nadministration of the court docket.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 83.  The\n                                        \nDistrict of New Hampshire  has promulgated a set of  local rules.\nOne  such rule provides that, with regard to most motions, \"[t]he\nmoving party shall certify to  the court that he has made  a good\nfaith  attempt  to  obtain  concurrence in  the  relief  sought.\"\n\n                                3\n\n          Consequently, the clerk  of court refused  to\n          accept the defective pleading (which we shall\n          refer  to  as  the  noncompliant  motion) for\n          filing.\n\n               3.August 31, 1993.  The  district court,\n                                \n          acting  at ALPA's request, entered an amended\n          judgment  clarifying  the original  judgment.\n          On the same date, Precision filed a notice of\n          appeal.\n\n               4.September 1, 1993:  The district court\n                                  \n          entered  an \"Order  of Refusal  of Pleading,\"\n          endorsing  the clerk's  refusal to  place the\n          noncompliant motion on record.\n\n               5.September 9, 1993:  Precision served a\n                                  \n          new motion for reconsideration of  the August\n          17  judgment.    This  motion  satisfied  the\n          requirements of the local rules.\n\n               6.September 10, 1993:   Precision  filed\n                                   \n          the September 9 motion in the clerk's office.\n          It also requested a  stay of judgment pending\n          appeal.  On the same date, Precision withdrew\n          its first notice of appeal.\n\n               7.September  22,  1993:    The  district\n                                     \n          court   entered   an   order   declining   to\n          reconsider  the  final  judgment and  denying\n          Precision's request  for a  stay.   The court\n          stated  that  a  motion  for  reconsideration\n          should have been  served on or before  August\n          27,  and  that   Precision's  efforts   were,\n          therefore,  untimely.    The court  erred  in\n          identifying the end date; taking into account\n          the  special directives  of the  Civil Rules,\n          see   Fed.  R.   Civ.  P.   6(a)  (explaining\n             \n          principles  governing computation  of periods\n          of 10  days or  less), the 10-day  period for\n          filing  a   motion  to  alter  or  amend  the\n          judgment, Fed.  R.  Civ. P.  59(e),  did  not\n          expire until August 31.\n\n                    \n\nD.N.H.  Loc. R.  11(b).   This rule  applies foursquare  to post-\njudgment  motions (such  as  are at  issue in  this  case).   See\n                                                                 \nClausen  v. Sea-3, Inc.,      F.3d    ,      (1st Cir. 1994) [No.\n                       \n93-1106, slip  op.  at  42]  (explaining that  Local  Rule  11(b)\napplies  to all motions other than those filed during trial); see\n                                                                 \nalso D.N.H.

In this motion, Precision pointed\n          out  the  court's  computational   error  and\n          contended  that  the noncompliant  motion met\n          the applicable time constraints.\n\n               9.October    12,    1993:       Although\n                                       \n          acknowledging  its  computational error,  the\n          district    court    nevertheless    remained\n          steadfast  and  denied Precision's  October 7\n          motion.      The   court   noted   that   the\n          noncompliant motion did  not conform to Local\n          Rule 11(b)  and  was, therefore,  a  nullity.\n          The September 9 motion also lacked force,  as\n          that  motion  was  neither served  nor  filed\n          within the requisite 10-day period.\n\n               10.October 13, 1993:   The court entered\n                                  \n          a further judgment commemorating  the October\n          12 order, as required by Fed.  R. Civ. P. 58.\n          See Fiore  v. Washington County  Comm. Mental\n                                                       \n          Health  Ctr., 960  F.2d  229,  233 (1st  Cir.\n                      \n          1992) (en banc).\n\n               11.November  5,  1993:   Precision filed\n                                    \n          its  notice of  appeal, seeking  to challenge\n          (a) the August 17 judgment, (b) the September\n          22 order, and (c) the October 13 judgment.\n\n                               II.\n                                  \n\n                             Analysis\n                                     \n\n                                A.\n                                  \n\n          In  civil cases  in which  the United  States is  not a\n\nparty,  a notice  of  appeal must  be  filed within  thirty  days\n\nfollowing  the entry  of final  judgment.   See Fed.  R. App.  P.\n                                               \n\n4(a)(1).   The  requirement for  punctual filing  of a  notice of\n\nappeal is obligatory and jurisdictional.  See Browder v. Illinois\n                                                                 \n\nDep't  of Correction,  434  U.S. 257,  264  (1978); Feinstein  v.\n                                                             \n\nMoses, 951  F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir.  1991).  Precision filed notice\n     \n\nof the instant appeal on November 5, 1993   far  more than thirty\n\n                                5\n\ndays  after the  entry of  the  August 17  judgment.2   Thus, the\n\nthreshold issue is whether some idiosyncratic feature of the case\n\nbreathed life into the (apparently tardy) notice of appeal.\n\n          Appellant  offers a variety  of possible scenarios, all\n\nof which implicate Fed. R.  Civ. P. 59(e).  In terms, a motion to\n\nalter or amend a  judgment, made under that rule,  interrupts the\n\nrunning  of the appeal period as long  as it is \"served not later\n\nthan 10 days after entry of  the judgment.\"  Thereafter, an order\n\ndisposing  of  the  motion  restarts  the  appeal  period.    See\n                                                                 \n\nFeinstein, 951 F.2d at 18; see also Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4).  The\n                                   \n\nrule's  10-day  window is  mandatory  and  jurisdictional.3   See\n                                                                 \n\nVargas v. Gonzalez, 975 F.2d 916, 917 (1st Cir. 1992); Barrett v.\n                                                              \n\nUnited States, 965 F.2d  1184, 1187 (1st Cir.  1992).  Thus,  the\n             \n\nperiod  set  for  prosecuting a  Rule  59(e)  motion  may not  be\n\nextended.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b) (explaining that the district\n              \n\n                    \n\n     2The parties agree that final judgment entered on August 17,\n1993.  Though the  district court entered an amended  judgment on\nAugust 31, 1993, see  Chronology, supra, at No. 3,  the amendment\n                                       \nserved strictly as a means of clarification and did not alter the\nparties' substantive rights under  the preexisting judgment.  The\nsettled rule is that the non-substantive revision of a previously\nentered judgment  does not restart or otherwise affect the period\nwithin  which  appellate  review must  be  sought.    See FTC  v.\n                                                             \nMinneapolis-Honeywell Co., 344  U.S. 206, 211-12  (1952).  It  is\n                         \nonly when the judgment-issuing  court alters matters of substance\nor resolves some genuine  ambiguity that the entry of  an amended\njudgment winds the appeals clock anew.  See id.; see also Charles\n                                                                 \nv.  Daley, 799  F.2d 343,  348 (7th  Cir. 1986).   In  this case,\n         \nPrecision never has contended that entry of  the amended judgment\nsignalled the commencement of a new appeal period.\n\n     3The  timeliness of a Rule 59(e) motion is determined by the\ndate  of service, not  the date  of filing.   See  Perez-Perez v.\n                                                              \nPopular  Leasing Rental, Inc., 993 F.2d 281, 283 (1st Cir. 1993);\n                             \nRoque-Rodriguez  v.

See Jusino v. Zayas, 875\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  986,  989-90 &amp;  n.3  (1st Cir.  1989)  (discussing district\n\ncourt's inherent  power to  correct errors  in its  own decrees).\n\nMoreover,  if  such  a motion  is  denied,  the  movant may  seek\n\nappellate review of  the denial.

We caution,\n                    \n\nhowever,  that a timely appeal from an order denying a motion for\n\nreconsideration brought other than  in conformity with Rule 59(e)\n\ndoes not  \"resurrect [the  appellant's] expired right  to contest\n\nthe merits  of the  underlying judgment,  nor bring  the judgment\n\nitself before [the court of appeals] for review.\"  Id.\n                                                      \n\n                                B.\n                                  \n\n          It is against this tightly woven backdrop that  we turn\n\nto appellant's  asseverational array.  Appellant's  central claim\n\nis  that,   whatever  its  deficiencies  might   have  been,  the\n\nnoncompliant  motion was  a timely-filed  Rule 59(e)  motion and,\n\ntherefore, tolled the appeal  period in respect to the  August 17\n\njudgment.  We do not agree.\n\n                                7\n\n          This  initiative depends  on  the  significance of  the\n\nadmitted  defect in  the  motion    the  motion plainly  did  not\n\nsatisfy  the   requirements  of  the   local  rules      and  the\n\nsupportability of the  lower court's response  to it.   Appellant\n\nattempts to shrug off the matter of noncompliance, contending, in\n\neffect, that Local  Rule 11(b)  is somewhat silly,  and that  the\n\ndistrict  court's slavish  adherence to  it sanctifies  \"an empty\n\nformality.\"\n\n          We  think  appellant  presumes  too  much.    Rules  of\n\nprocedure  are vitally  important  in judges'  efforts to  manage\n\nburgeoning caseloads  with some semblance of  efficiency.  Within\n\nwide  limits, it  is for  courts, not  litigants, to  decide what\n\nrules  are desirable  and how  rigorously to  enforce them.

District courts  enjoy broad\n\nlatitude  in administering  local  rules.   See United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nRoberts, 978  F.2d 17,  20 (1st  Cir. 1992); Diaz-Villafane,  874\n                                                           \n\nF.2d at 46.  In the  exercise of that discretion, district courts\n\nare entitled  to demand adherence to  specific mandates contained\n\nin  the rules.  See, e.g., Clausen  v.

Loc. R. 11(a)(1).   This provision, aposematic  in and of\n\nitself,  is  reinforced  by  a  further  provision  that  clearly\n\ncontemplates the striking of  noncompliant pleadings.  See D.N.H.\n                                                          \n\nLoc.

We perceive  no inconsistency.   While Local  Rule\n2(f) instructs that  \"[d]ocuments which fail  to comply with  the\nprovisions of these rules shall be filed by the clerk, subject to\nbeing stricken by the court,\" Local Rule  11(a)(1) instructs that\n\"[t]he  Clerk shall not accept any motions not in compliance with\nprocedures outlined in these Rules.\"  The latter rule is narrowly\ntailored and relates specifically to  motions.  Hence, it governs\nin  cases  involving nonconforming  motions.    See generally  2B\n                                                             \nNorman J.

Indeed,  it is\n\ndifficult to imagine  how a judge could  be found to  have abused\n\nhis  discretion in  following the  very course  of action  openly\n\nadvocated by the court's rules.\n\n                                C.\n                                  \n\n          Appellant's   next   argument    is   ingenious,    but\n\nunpersuasive.   Although  phrased in  various ways,  the argument\n\namounts to a claim  that the September 9 motion,  see Chronology,\n                                                     \n\nsupra  at  No.  5,  somehow  related  back  to  the date  of  the\n     \n\nnoncompliant motion or  served to reinstate that  motion nunc pro\n                                                                 \n\ntunc.\n    \n\n          The short, dispositive answer to this claim is that the\n\nlocal  rules do  not accord  a noncompliant  motion any  force or\n\neffect.   To the contrary,  the rules rather conspicuously convey\n\nthe court's intention to treat  noncompliant motions as null  and\n\nvoid.  See  D.N.H. Loc.  R. 11(a)(1) (stating  that the clerk  of\n          \n\ncourt shall  refuse to  accept noncompliant motions  for filing);\n\nsee  also  D.N.H.  Loc.  R. 2(f)  (explaining  that  noncompliant\n         \n\n                                10\n\ndocuments are subject to being stricken).\n\n          If there is any  lingering doubt as to this  reading of\n\nthe local rules   and we see no room for any such dubiety   it is\n\ndispelled by  the instruction  contained in the  district court's\n\norder of  refusal,  Chronology, supra,  at No.  4, which  stated:\n                                     \n\n\"When/if   resubmitted,    the   [motion]   should    contain   a\n\nrecertification  of service  on opposing  counsel/parties.\"   The\n\norder of refusal also discussed the possibility that resubmission\n\nof the motion might \"bring the filing outside of a  specific date\n\nas set by court rule.\"  In other words, the court made plain that\n\nthe  old motion  was dead  and that  a new  motion, having  a new\n\nfiling  date,  would  be  required.    Since  a district  court's\n\nplausible  construction  of its  own  local rule  is  entitled to\n\nconsiderable  deference, see,  e.g.,  City of  Waltham v.  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates Postal Serv., 11  F.3d 235, 243 (1st Cir.  1993); see also\n                                                                 \n\n12  Wright  &amp; Miller,  supra,    3153  (1973), this  viewpoint is\n                            \n\ntelling.\n\n          To sum up, the  noncompliant motion was a nullity.   It\n\nfollows  inexorably that  the September 9  motion did  not relate\n\nback to the earlier motion or supplant it nunc pro tunc.  Rather,\n                                                       \n\nthe new motion had to  be evaluated on its  own merit, not as  an\n\nextension of the noncompliant motion.  So viewed, the September 9\n\nmotion cannot serve as a vehicle for restarting the appeal period\n\nbecause  it was filed beyond the 10-day period stipulated in Rule\n\n59(e).\n\n                                D.\n                                  \n\n                                11\n\n          Appellant's  next  attempt  to   reach  the  August  17\n\njudgment smacks of trying to cram a square peg into a round hole.\n\nPrecision  posits  that  an  appellate court  may  grant  special\n\ndispensation from the temporal requirement for docketing a notice\n\nof  appeal \"where  an appellant  has filed  a belated  motion for\n\nreconsideration and relied on the district court's statement that\n\nthe motion  was timely in forgoing the timeous filing of a notice\n\nof appeal.\"  Feinstein, 951 F.2d at 19; see also Thompson v. INS,\n                                                                \n\n375 U.S. 384, 386-87 (1964) (per  curiam).  It then hints that it\n\nis  deserving of sanctuary under  this principle.   We agree with\n\nappellant's premise   a limited  exception does exist for \"unique\n\ncircumstances\"    but we disagree  with its conclusion  that this\n\nappeal is  eligible  for  such special  swaddling.    We  explain\n\nbriefly.\n\n          There are two preconditions  to the availability of the\n\n\"unique circumstances\" exception.   First, the exception \"applies\n\nonly where a party has performed an act which,  if properly done,\n\nwould  postpone  the  deadline  for filing  his  appeal  and  has\n\nreceived specific  assurance by a judicial officer  that this act\n\nhas been properly done.\"  Osterneck v. Ernst &amp; Whinney,  489 U.S.\n                                                      \n\n169,  179 (1989).  Second,  the court's action  or statement must\n\nhave occurred at a point when, had the party not been led astray,\n\nit would have  been able to file a timeous notice of appeal.  See\n                                                                 \n\nFeinstein,  951 F.2d  at  20.    Here,  neither  precondition  is\n         \n\nsatisfied, for the district  court did nothing to  lull appellant\n\ninto inactivity.\n\n                                12\n\n          Appellant's contrary claim has two prongs.  One centers\n\naround the  district court's  initial denial  of the  September 9\n\nmotion.  See  Chronology, supra, at No. 7.   This prong is easily\n                               \n\nblunted.    After all,  the  court ruled  unequivocally  that the\n\nmotion  was untimely vis-a-vis the final judgment.  The fact that\n\nthe  court  made  an  erroneous  calculation  in  the  course  of\n\nannouncing  its ruling was unfortunate   but, given the denial of\n\nthe motion, the bevue could not  in any way have lulled appellant\n\ninto a false sense of security regarding filing deadlines.\n\n          The  remaining  prong of  appellant's claim  focuses on\n\nPrecision's  ostensible  belief  that,  when  the district  court\n\nrejected the noncompliant motion, it (Precision) could refile the\n\nmotion nunc pro tunc after paying belated obeisance to Local Rule\n                    \n\n11(b).  But  if appellant  harbored this belief,  it was  wishful\n\nthinking   not premised  on anything that the district  court did\n\nor said.  Indeed, the order  of refusal expressly stated that \"if\n\nthe resubmission of  said pleading will bring the  filing outside\n\nof a specific date as  set by court rule or court order, a motion\n\nfor extension must accompany the refiling.\"\n\n          That effectively ends the matter.  Where a party claims\n\nto have relied to its detriment  on a trial judge's statement  or\n\naction,  it  can   derive  no  benefit  unless  its  reliance  is\n\nobjectively reasonable.  See Feinstein, 951 F.2d at 20; Pinion v.\n                                                              \n\nDow Chemical, 928 F.2d  1522, 1532 (11th Cir.), cert  denied, 112\n                                                            \n\nS.  Ct. 438 (1991).   Here,  especially in  light of  the court's\n\nspecific admonition,  Precision could not  reasonably have relied\n\n                                13\n\non  the refusal  of the  noncompliant motion  as evidence  that a\n\nresubmission would be accepted nunc pro tunc.\n                                            \n\n          Appellant's remaining attempts  to reach the underlying\n\njudgment  are meritless and do  not require discussion.   We lack\n\njurisdiction to review the August 17 judgment.\n\n                                E.\n                                  \n\n          Appellant also  contends that the district  court erred\n\nin  denying  its two  later  motions  for reconsideration.

Although the notice of appeal\n                 \n\nis timely as to these  rulings,6 it does not serve to  reopen the\n\nexpired  appeal period  vis-a-vis the  underlying judgment.   See\n                                                                 \n\nRodriguez-Antuna, 871 F.2d at 2; Appeal of Sun Pipe Line Co., 831\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  22,  24-25 (1st  Cir. 1987),  cert.  denied, 486  U.S. 1055\n                                                 \n\n(1988).     In   the  circumstances   of  this   case,  appellate\n\njurisdiction  is  restricted to  the September  22 order  and the\n\nOctober 13 judgment.\n\n          As  a practical  matter, the  October 13  judgment adds\n\nvery  little to the mix.  That judgment memorializes the district\n\ncourt's denial of the  October 6 motion for reconsideration.   To\n\n                    \n\n     6The district court  denied the September 9 motion  by order\nentered September 22, 1993.  See Chronology, supra, at No. 7.  We\n                                                  \nassume arguendo, favorably to  appellant, that the ensuing motion\n               \nfor  reconsideration, filed  on  October 6,  see  id. at  No.  8,\n                                                     \nsuspended  the running  of the  appeal period  with respect  to a\npossible appeal of  the September 22 order.  See  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n                                                \n59(e); Fed. R.  App. P. 4(a)(1).  On this  assumption, the appeal\nperiod began to run afresh on October 13, following the denial of\nappellant's October 6  motion.   The notice of  appeal was  filed\nwithin thirty days of  this date.  See Chronology,  supra, at No.\n                                                         \n11.\n\n                                14\n\nthe extent that  the motion successfully  sought correction of  a\n\nmisstatement  made by  the  district court  in  the September  22\n\norder, see Chronology, supra, at No. 7, appellant  prevailed, and\n                            \n\ncannot  appeal.    To  the  extent  that  the  October  6  motion\n\nunsuccessfully sought a change  in the bottom-line disposition of\n\nthe case,  the court's rejection of  it stands on a  par with the\n\ncourt's rejection of the  September 9 motion for reconsideration,\n\nmemorialized  in the September 22 order.  Accordingly, we discuss\n\nonly the September motion and order   but we do so on the express\n\nunderstanding that our comments  apply with undiminished force to\n\nwhat transpired in October.\n\n          The September  9 motion sought  reconsideration of  the\n\nunderlying judgment.  Under  First Circuit precedent, an untimely\n\nRule  59(e) motion may be dismissed summarily by the trial court.\n\nSee, e.g., Rodriguez-Antuna, 871  F.2d at 2-3; Silk v.  Sandoval,\n                                                                \n\n435 F.2d 1266,  1267 (1st Cir.  1971).  But  the court, if it  so\n\nelects, may use even a belated Rule 59(e) motion as a vehicle for\n\nrethinking  its  original ruling,  so  long  as the  court  still\n\nretains  jurisdiction over the case.  See, e.g., United States v.\n                                                              \n\n789 Cases  of Latex  Surgeon  Gloves, 13  F.3d 12,  14 (1st  Cir.\n                                    \n\n1993); Jusino, 875 F.2d at 989-90;  see also 11 Wright &amp;  Miller,\n                                            \n\nsupra,   2858 &amp; n.22 (1973 &amp; Supp. 1994).\n     \n\n          In  this instance,  the  lower court  chose the  former\n\noption.  Even had the court chosen the latter option, however, an\n\nequally unhappy fate would have awaited the movant.   In the last\n\nanalysis, the court  of appeals will overturn a  district court's\n\n                                15\n\ndenial of a motion for reconsideration only if the record evinces\n\na clear abuse of discretion.  See Fragoso v. Lopez, 991 F.2d 878,\n                                                  \n\n888 (1st Cir. 1993); Weinberger v. Great Northern  Nekoosa Corp.,\n                                                                \n\n915 F.2d 518, 528-29 (1st Cir. 1991); Sun Pipe Line,  831 F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n25.   This is a steep  climb   and appellant  lacks the necessary\n\nhorsepower to attain such altitudes.\n\n          In its motion, Precision asked that the order to compel\n\narbitration  be reexamined for  two reasons.   First, it asserted\n\nthat  the  court reached  an  erroneous  legal result,  pure  and\n\nsimple.  Insofar as the motion was predicated on this ground, the\n\ncourt  appropriately   rejected  it:    a   trial  court,  having\n\nconsidered  the parties' arguments and ruled on them, is under no\n\nobligation  to repastinate  well-ploughed soil simply  because an\n\nunsuccessful  litigant balks at taking  \"no\" for an  answer.  See\n                                                                 \n\nNational  Metal  Finishing  Co. v.  BarclaysAmerican  Commercial,\n                                                                 \n\nInc., 899  F.2d 119, 123  (1st Cir.  1990); Van Skiver  v. United\n                                                                 \n\nStates, 952 F.2d 1241,  1243 (10th Cir. 1991), cert.  denied, 113\n                                                            \n\nS. Ct. 89 (1992).\n\n          Appellant also requested reconsideration in light of  a\n\nruling  handed down  by  the National  Mediation  Board (NMB)  on\n\nAugust 11,  1993, while ALPA's  motion for  summary judgment  was\n\npending in the district court.  This constituted new matter.  The\n\nissue  before  the NMB  concerned  the  representation of  pilots\n\nemployed  by Precision  and by  an affiliated  airline.   The NMB\n\ndetermined   that   the   two   airlines   comprised  a   \"single\n\ntransportation  system\" for collective  bargaining purposes under\n\n                                16\n\nthe Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.    151-188 (1988), and ordered a\n\nrepresentation   election.      Seizing   on   this  development,\n\nappellant's  motion   posited  that  arbitrating   the  grievance\n\nunderlying this case with a representation election in the offing\n\nwould infringe upon the jurisdiction of the NMB.\n\n          This  contention   comprises  more  bleat   than  wool.\n\nPrecision neglects  to mention that the  NMB's order specifically\n\nprovides  that  \"[p]ending  resolution  of   this  representation\n\ndispute,  ALPA's  certification  [as  the  collective  bargaining\n\nrepresentative for Precision's pilots] remains in effect.\"  Given\n\nthe  untimeliness  of  appellant's  motion and  the  NMB's  clear\n\nstatement  anent ALPA's  representational  authority, we  find no\n\nhint of abused  discretion in the district court's order refusing\n\nreconsideration.\n\n                               III.\n                                   \n\n                            Conclusion\n                                      \n\n          We  need go  no further.7    When Precision  elected to\n\n                    \n\n     7    The current  version of Fed. R. Civ.  P. 5(e) provides,\n          inter  alia,  that \"[t]he  clerk  shall  not refuse  to\n                     \n          accept for filing any  paper presented for that purpose\n          solely because it  is not presented  in proper form  as\n          required  by   these  rules  or  any   local  rules  or\n          practices.\"   Appellant  neither cited  this  rule  nor\n          relied  on it in any way and has, therefore, waived any\n          potential benefit which might accrue from it.  For this\n          reason, we do not refer to the rule in the body of this\n          opinion.   But we note that, in all events, the clerk's\n          refusal to accept the noncompliant motion for filing in\n          this case was backed by the judge's specific order, see\n                                                                 \n          Chronology,  supra, at  No.  4, leaving  the record  in\n                            \n          essentially the  same posture as though  the motion had\n          been  received  and  then  stricken.

In the aftermath of this  pilot error, we lack appellate\n\njurisdiction  to review  the underlying  judgment on  the merits.\n\nSubstantively, then, our  scrutiny must be confined to the denial\n\nof  two  post-judgment motions.    On  that circumscribed  basis,\n\nPrecision's appeal stalls.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                18\n",

We\n\nattempt to clear the air by chronicling the events that frame the\n\njurisdictional issue.\n\n               1.August 17, 1993:  The  district court,\n                                \n          acting  on a  motion  for  summary  judgment,\n          entered  a final judgment  in ALPA's favor on\n          count 1 of its complaint.

See Fed. R. Civ. P. 83.  The\n                                        \nDistrict of New Hampshire  has promulgated a set of  local rules.\nOne  such rule provides that, with regard to most motions, \"[t]he\nmoving party shall certify to  the court that he has made  a good\nfaith  attempt  to  obtain  concurrence in  the  relief  sought.\"\n\n                                3\n\n          Consequently, the clerk  of court refused  to\n          accept the defective pleading (which we shall\n          refer  to  as  the  noncompliant  motion) for\n          filing.\n\n               3.August 31, 1993.  The  district court,\n                                \n          acting  at ALPA's request, entered an amended\n          judgment  clarifying  the original  judgment.\n          On the same date, Precision filed a notice of\n          appeal.\n\n               4.September 1, 1993:  The district court\n                                  \n          entered  an \"Order  of Refusal  of Pleading,\"\n          endorsing  the clerk's  refusal to  place the\n          noncompliant motion on record.\n\n               5.September 9, 1993:  Precision served a\n                                  \n          new motion for reconsideration of  the August\n          17  judgment.    This  motion  satisfied  the\n          requirements of the local rules.\n\n               6.September 10, 1993:   Precision  filed\n                                   \n          the September 9 motion in the clerk's office.\n          It also requested a  stay of judgment pending\n          appeal.  On the same date, Precision withdrew\n          its first notice of appeal.\n\n               7.September  22,  1993:    The  district\n                                     \n          court   entered   an   order   declining   to\n          reconsider  the  final  judgment and  denying\n          Precision's request  for a  stay.   The court\n          stated  that  a  motion  for  reconsideration\n          should have been  served on or before  August\n          27,  and  that   Precision's  efforts   were,\n          therefore,  untimely.    The court  erred  in\n          identifying the end date; taking into account\n          the  special directives  of the  Civil Rules,\n          see   Fed.  R.   Civ.

Second,  the court's action  or statement must\n\nhave occurred at a point when, had the party not been led astray,\n\nit would have  been able to file a timeous notice of appeal.  See\n                                                                 \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573153\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Feinstein,</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/573153/frederick-feinstein-v-morris-and-joyce-moses-dba-sun-cal-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  at  <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.    Here,  neither  precondition  is\n         \n\nsatisfied, for the district  court did nothing to  lull appellant\n\ninto inactivity.\n\n                                12\n\n          Appellant's contrary claim has two prongs.  One centers\n\naround the  district court's  initial denial  of the  September 9\n\nmotion.  See  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Chronology,</span> supra</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at No. 7.   This prong is easily\n                               \n\nblunted.    After all,  the  court ruled  unequivocally  that the\n\nmotion  was untimely vis-a-vis the final judgment.  The fact that\n\nthe  court  made  an  erroneous  calculation  in  the  course  of\n\nannouncing  its ruling was unfortunate   but, given the denial of\n\nthe motion, the bevue could not  in any way have lulled appellant\n\ninto a false sense of security regarding filing deadlines.\n\n          The  remaining  prong of  appellant's claim  focuses on\n\nPrecision's  ostensible  belief  that,  when  the district  court\n\nrejected the noncompliant motion, it (Precision) could refile the\n\nmotion nunc pro tunc after paying belated obeisance to Local Rule\n                    \n\n11(b).  But  if appellant  harbored this belief,  it was  wishful\n\nthinking   not premised  on anything that the district  court did\n\nor said.  Indeed, the order  of refusal expressly stated that \"if\n\nthe resubmission of  said pleading will bring the  filing outside\n\nof a specific date as  set by court rule or court order, a motion\n\nfor extension must accompany the refiling.\"\n\n          That effectively ends the matter.  Where a party claims\n\nto have relied to its detriment  on a trial judge's statement  or\n\naction,  it  can   derive  no  benefit  unless  its  reliance  is\n\nobjectively reasonable.

This is a steep  climb   and appellant  lacks the necessary\n\nhorsepower to attain such altitudes.\n\n          In its motion, Precision asked that the order to compel\n\narbitration  be reexamined for  two reasons.   First, it asserted\n\nthat  the  court reached  an  erroneous  legal result,  pure  and\n\nsimple.  Insofar as the motion was predicated on this ground, the\n\ncourt  appropriately   rejected  it:    a   trial  court,  having\n\nconsidered  the parties' arguments and ruled on them, is under no\n\nobligation  to repastinate  well-ploughed soil simply  because an\n\nunsuccessful  litigant balks at taking  \"no\" for an  answer.

This constituted new matter.  The\n\nissue  before  the NMB  concerned  the  representation of  pilots\n\nemployed  by Precision  and by  an affiliated  airline.   The NMB\n\ndetermined   that   the   two   airlines   comprised  a   \"single\n\ntransportation  system\" for collective  bargaining purposes under\n\n                                16\n\nthe Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.    151-188 (1988), and ordered a\n\nrepresentation   election.      Seizing   on   this  development,\n\nappellant's  motion   posited  that  arbitrating   the  grievance\n\nunderlying this case with a representation election in the offing\n\nwould infringe upon the jurisdiction of the NMB.\n\n          This  contention   comprises  more  bleat   than  wool.\n\nPrecision neglects  to mention that the  NMB's order specifically\n\nprovides  that  \"[p]ending  resolution  of   this  representation\n\ndispute,  ALPA's  certification  [as  the  collective  bargaining\n\nrepresentative for Precision's pilots] remains in effect.\"  Given\n\nthe  untimeliness  of  appellant's  motion and  the  NMB's  clear\n\nstatement  anent ALPA's  representational  authority, we  find no\n\nhint of abused  discretion in the district court's order refusing\n\nreconsideration.\n\n                               III.\n                                   \n\n                            Conclusion\n                                      \n\n          We  need go  no further.7    When Precision  elected to\n\n                    \n\n     7    The current  version of Fed. R. Civ.  P. 5(e) provides,\n          inter  alia,  that \"[t]he  clerk  shall  not refuse  to\n                     \n          accept for filing any  paper presented for that purpose\n          solely because it  is not presented  in proper form  as\n          required  by   these  rules  or  any   local  rules  or\n          practices.\"   Appellant  neither cited  this  rule  nor\n          relied  on it in any way and has, therefore, waived any\n          potential benefit which might accrue from it.  For this\n          reason, we do not refer to the rule in the body of this\n          opinion.   But we note that, in all events, the clerk's\n          refusal to accept the noncompliant motion for filing in\n          this case was backed by the judge's specific order, see\n                                                                 \n          </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Chronology,</span>  supra</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at  No.  4, leaving  the record  in\n                            \n          essentially the  same posture as though  the motion had\n          been  received  and  then  stricken.   Any  error  was,\n          therefore, harmless.\n\n                                17\n\ndisregard  Local Rule  11(b),  it flew  headlong into  unfriendly\n\nskies.   In the aftermath of this  pilot error, we lack appellate\n\njurisdiction  to review  the underlying  judgment on  the merits.\n\nSubstantively, then, our  scrutiny must be confined to the denial\n\nof  two  post-judgment motions.    On  that circumscribed  basis,\n\nPrecision's appeal stalls.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                18\n</pre>",
