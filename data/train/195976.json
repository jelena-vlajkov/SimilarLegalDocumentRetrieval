See  18 U.S.C.     924\r                                                        \n\n(c)(1).  Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n          On  June  4,  1993,  the  Providence  Police Department\n\nexecuted a search warrant  at the Crass apartment and  discovered\n\nmarijuana  and  cocaine  throughout.1   On  a  closet shelf,  the\n\npolice  found  seventeen  baggies  of cocaine  and  two  pistols.\n\nAlthough  the  hand grip  on one  firearm  was broken,  both were\n\nloaded  and operable.    The  putative  owner testified  for  the\n\ndefense  that he  had left  one unloaded  firearm with  Crass for\n\nrepair six months prior  to the search,  and the other for  safe-\n\nkeeping a week before the search. \n\n          Crass first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence,\n\nwhich  we  review in  the light  most  favorable to  the verdict.\n\nUnited States  v. Cotto-Aponte, 30  F.3d 4,  5  (1st  Cir. 1994).\r                                        \n\nNotwithstanding  their proximity  to the  baggies of  cocaine, he\n\ncontends on appeal, as he  did below, that the firearms  were not\n\nused  during and in relation  to a drug  trafficking crime within\n\nthe meaning  of 18 U.S.C.   924(c)(1).   He principally relies on\n\nUnited States v. Bruce, 939 F.2d  1053 (D.C. Cir. 1991), for  the\r                                \n\nclaim  that there  was insufficient  evidence of  a \"facilitative\n\nnexus,\" see United States  v. Paulino, 13  F.3d 20, 26 (1st  Cir.\r                                               \n\n                    \r                              \n\n     1Crass pled guilty to  three drug trafficking offenses based\non the evidence seized from his apartment.\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n1994), between the firearms  and the drugs found in  the closet.2\n\n          Under  our  \"facilitative nexus\"  test, a  section 924-\n\n(c)(1) conviction may lie even though the evidence establishes no\n\nmore than that  a firearm served a passive purpose  during and in\r                                                    \n\nrelation to  the commission of  a drug crime,  as by  affording a\n\nmeans  of safeguarding  drugs  possessed for  distribution.   The\n\nclose  proximity  between the  firearms  and  the cocaine  seized\n\ninside  the same closet enabled the jury reasonably to infer that\n\nCrass  kept  the firearms  for  the purpose  of  safeguarding the\n\ncocaine,  see United States v.  Bergodere, 40 F.3d  512, 519 (1st\r                                                   \n\nCir.  1994),  clearly  establishing the  necessary  \"facilitative\n\nnexus.\"  See Smith v. United States, 113 S. Ct. 2050 (1993).\r                                             \n\n          Second, Crass claims surprise and prejudice from police\n\ntestimony concerning  the street value  of the cocaine  seized in\n\nthe search.  At a pretrial  hearing on his request for disclosure\n\nof expert testimony to  be presented by the government,  see Fed.\r                                                                      \n\nR. Crim.  P. 16(a)(1)(E), Crass  sought to ascertain  whether the\n\ngovernment  intended  to  have  \"police officers  com[e]  in  and\n\ntestify[] about giving  opinions about  the use of  the guns  and\r                                                                      \n\nbeing  consistent with their experience and  that kind of thing.\"\n\n(emphasis added).  The government disavowed any such intention. \n\n                    \r                              \n\n     2Neither party noted that Bruce had been overruled in United\r                                                                           \nStates v. Bailey,  36 F.3d 106,  115 (D.C. Cir.  1994) (en  banc)\r                          \n(Ginsburg, J.), cert. denied, 63 U.S.L.W. 3642 (U.S. 1995), which\r                                      \nexplicitly adopted our \"facilitative nexus\" test.  \n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          At trial,  the government  presented a  narcotics offi-\n\ncer's testimony on  the current  street value of  the seized  co-\n\ncaine,  for the purpose of establishing  that Crass possessed the\n\nfirearms as a means of safeguarding the valuable cocaine stash he\n\nkept in the  apartment.  Crass later urged the  district court to\n\nexclude  the  testimony  because it  had  not  been  disclosed in\n\nresponse to  the Rule 16 motion.   The court declined.   It ruled\n\nthat the  testimony did  not come within  the pretrial  discovery\n\nrequest, that it was on the cusp of fact and expert testimony and\n\nthat  defense counsel  would be  allowed to  \"cross-examine about\n\n[the  expert witness's] experience in this area and what he knows\n\nabout street prices of drugs.\"          The   duty  to   disclose\n\nunder Rule 16 is triggered by a proper request.  United States v.\r                                                                        \n\nCarrasquillo-Plaza,  873 F.2d 10, 12  (1st Cir. 1989).   The dis-\r                            \n\ntrict  court  supportably  ruled,  inter alia,  that  the  police\r                                                       \n\ntestimony proffered by  the government  did not  come within  the\n\npretrial  motion submitted  by the  defense, because  it directly\n\nrelated to  the street value of  the seized drugs  and only indi-\n\nrectly to  the purpose for which  Crass kept the guns.   Yet more\n\nimportantly, the  defense  neither  requested  a  continuance  to\n\nobtain its own evidence on street drug prices, nor does it allege\r                                                                           \n\nprejudice.  Even on appeal Crass makes  no claim that the \"street\n\nprice\" for cocaine in Providence was different than the narcotics\n\nofficer  stated.  See United  States v. Sepulveda,  15 F.3d 1161,\r                                                           \n\n1178 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"The lack  of demonstrable prejudice sounds\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nthe death knell  for a  'delayed discovery' claim.\").   Thus,  we\n\nfind neither error nor prejudice.  \n\n          Third, Crass claims that he was entitled to a two-point\n\ndownward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility  pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G.   3E1.1.  The defendant  bears the burden of proof under\n\nsection 3E1.1 and we review the sentencing court ruling for clear\n\nerror.   United  States v.  Morillo, 8  F.3d  864, 871  (1st Cir.\r                                             \n\n1993).         Although  Crass  acknowledges that  the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines generally  preclude a  downward adjustment  for accep-\n\ntance of responsibility where  the defendant \"puts the government\n\nto its burden of proof at trial  by denying the essential factual\n\nelements of guilt, is  convicted, and only then admits  guilt and\n\nexpresses  remorse,\" U.S.S.G.    3E1.1 (n.2),  he argues  that he\n\nfits within an exception to the general rule.\n\n          In  rare situations  a defendant  may clearly\n          demonstrate  an acceptance  of responsibility\n          for his criminal conduct even though he exer-\n          cises  his constitutional  right to  a trial.\n          This may occur,  for example, where a  defen-\n          dant  goes to  trial to  assert  and preserve\n          issues  that do not  relate to  factual guilt\n          (e.g. to make a constitutional challenge to a\n          statute or a  challenge to the  applicability\n          of a statute to his conduct.)\n\nId.  Crass contends  that he qualified for a  downward adjustment\r             \n\nfor  acceptance of responsibility  notwithstanding the  fact that\n\nthe defense  represented, both at  trial and at  sentencing, that\n\nthe firearms were in  no respect related to the  drug trafficking\n\noffenses to which he had pled guilty.\n\n          The district  court correctly instructed the  jury that\n\nCrass could be convicted  only if he possessed the  firearms with\r                                                                           \n\n                                5\r\r\n\nintent to  facilitate drug trafficking.  United  States v. Reyes-\r                                                                           \n\nMercado, 22 F.3d 363, 367 (1st Cir. 1994) (defendant must possess\r                 \n\nfirearm with intent that it be \"available for possible use during\n\nor immediately following the  transaction, or [to facilitate] the\n\ntransaction by lending courage to the possessor.\").  In an effort\n\nto  blunt  the  government's case  on  the  essential  element of\n\nintent, the defense  called the putative  owner of the  firearms,\n\nwho testified that he had delivered  them to Crass for repair and\n\nsafekeeping.   Further, defense  counsel urged  the jury  to find\n\nthat the firearms were not possessed with intent to safeguard the\r                                                          \n\ndrugs.\n\n          Thus,  as was  his right,  Crass contested  the central\n\nfactual  element of intent both at trial  and at sentencing.  But\r                                    \n\nthe jury could  not have  convicted Crass on  the firearm  charge\n\nwithout  first  rejecting the  claim that  he  did not  intend to\n\npossess the firearms for  the purpose of safeguarding  the drugs.\n\nSee  id.  Except in extraordinary circumstances not present here,\r                 \n\nsee  U.S.S.G.   3E1.1  (n.2),  intent, like  any other  essential\r                                               \n\nelement of the crime charged, may  not be contested by the defen-\n\ndant without jeopardizing  a downward adjustment  for \"acceptance\n\nof responsibility\" in the event the sentencing court  rejects, as\n\ndid  the jury,  the  defendant's interpretation  of the  relevant\n\nevidence.  See United  States v. Bennett,  37 F.3d 687, 697  (1st\r                                                  \n\nCir.  1994).

The district court supportably ruled, inter alia, that the police testimony proffered by the government did not come within the pretrial motion submitted by the defense, because it directly related to the street value of the seized drugs and only indirectly to the purpose for which Crass kept the guns.  Yet more importantly, the defense neither requested a continuance to obtain its own evidence on street drug prices, nor does it allege prejudice.  Even on appeal Crass makes no claim that the \"street price\" for cocaine in Providence was different than the narcotics officer stated.  See United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1178 (1st Cir.1993) (\"The lack of demonstrable prejudice sounds the death knell for a 'delayed discovery' claim.\").  Thus, we find neither error nor prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Crass claims that he was entitled to a two-point downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1.  The defendant bears the burden of proof under section 3E1.1 and we review the sentencing court ruling for clear error.  United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 871 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Crass acknowledges that the Sentencing Guidelines generally preclude a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility where the defendant \"puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse,\" U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1 (n.2), he argues that he fits within an exception to the general rule.In rare situations a defendant may clearly demonstrate an acceptance of responsibility for his criminal conduct even though he exercises his constitutional right to a trial.  This may occur, for example, where a defendant goes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt (e.g. to make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to his conduct.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.  Crass contends that he qualified for a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility notwithstanding the fact that the defense represented, both at trial and at sentencing, that the firearms were in no respect related to the drug trafficking offenses to which he had pled guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly instructed the jury that Crass could be convicted only if he possessed the firearms with intent to facilitate drug trafficking.  United States v. Reyes-Mercado, 22 F.3d 363, 367 (1st Cir.1994) (defendant must possess firearm with intent that it be \"available for possible use during or immediately following the transaction, or [to facilitate] the transaction by lending courage to the possessor.\").  In an effort to blunt the government's case on the essential element of intent, the defense called the putative owner of the firearms, who testified that he had delivered them to Crass for repair and safekeeping.  Further, defense counsel urged the jury to find that the firearms were not possessed with intent to safeguard the drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, as was his right, Crass contested the central factual element of intent both at trial and at sentencing.  But the jury could not have convicted Crass on the firearm charge without first rejecting the claim that he did not intend to possess the firearms for the purpose of safeguarding the drugs.  See id.   Except in extraordinary circumstances not present here, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1 (n.2), intent, like any other essential element of the crime charged, may not be contested by the defendant without jeopardizing a downward adjustment for \"acceptance of responsibility\" in the event the sentencing court rejects, as did the jury, the defendant's interpretation of the relevant evidence.  See United States v. Bennett, 37 F.3d 687, 697 (1st Cir.1994).  The district court ruling was consistent with the law and the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Crass pled guilty to three drug trafficking offenses based on the evidence seized from his apartment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Neither party noted that Bruce had been overruled in United States v.

Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 4, 1993, the Providence Police Department executed a search warrant at the Crass apartment and discovered marijuana and cocaine throughout.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  On a closet shelf, the police found seventeen baggies of cocaine and two pistols.  Although the hand grip on one firearm was broken, both were loaded and operable.  The putative owner testified for the defense that he had left one unloaded firearm with Crass for repair six months prior to the search, and the other for safekeeping a week before the search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crass first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, which we review in the light most favorable to the verdict.

Cotto-Aponte, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195504\"><a href=\"/opinion/195504/united-states-v-cotto-aponte/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1994).  Notwithstanding their proximity to the baggies of cocaine, he contends on appeal, as he did below, that the firearms were not used during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1).  He principally relies on United States v. Bruce, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"565150\"><a href=\"/opinion/565150/united-states-v-bernardo-bruce/\"><span class=\"volume\">939</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1053</span> </a></span>(D.C.Cir.1991), for the claim that there was insufficient evidence of a \"facilitative nexus,\" see United States v. Paulino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195130\"><a href=\"/opinion/195130/united-states-v-paulino/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1994), between the firearms and the drugs found in the closet.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under our \"facilitative nexus\" test, a section 924(c)(1) conviction may lie even though the evidence establishes no more than that a firearm served a passive purpose during and in relation to the commission of a drug crime, as by affording a means of safeguarding drugs possessed for distribution.  The close proximity between the firearms and the cocaine seized inside the same closet enabled the jury reasonably to infer that Crass kept the firearms for the purpose of safeguarding the cocaine, see United States v. Bergodere, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195758\"><a href=\"/opinion/195758/united-states-v-bergodere/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></a></span>, 519 (1st Cir.1994), clearly establishing the necessary \"facilitative nexus.\"   See Smith v.

At a pretrial hearing on his request for disclosure of expert testimony to be presented by the government, see Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(E), Crass sought to ascertain whether the government intended to have \"police officers com[e] in and testify[ ] about giving opinions about the use of the guns and being consistent with their experience and that kind of thing.\"  (emphasis added).  The government disavowed any such intention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government presented a narcotics officer's testimony on the current street value of the seized cocaine, for the purpose of establishing that Crass possessed the firearms as a means of safeguarding the valuable cocaine stash he kept in the apartment.  Crass later urged the district court to exclude the testimony because it had not been disclosed in response to the Rule 16 motion.  The court declined.  It ruled that the testimony did not come within the pretrial discovery request, that it was on the cusp of fact and expert testimony and that defense counsel would be allowed to \"cross-examine about [the expert witness's] experience in this area and what he knows about street prices of drugs.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The duty to disclose under Rule 16 is triggered by a proper request.
