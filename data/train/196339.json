We have reviewed the parties' briefs\r                                \r\n\nand the  record on  appeal.   We affirm  the judgment  of the\r\n\ndistrict  court essentially  for  the reasons  stated in  its\r\n\nmemorandum  and  order dated  March  21, 1995.    Two points,\r\n\nhowever, call for additional comment.\r\n\n          First,  the plaintiff  offers  no  support for  his\r\n\nargument that the defendants  should have considered his four\r\n\nseparate requests for  free postage as a  single bulk request\r\n\nfor purposes of determining whether he was indigent.  103 CMR\r\n\n  481.06 makes it  clear that indigence is determined  at the\r\n\ntime of the particular request.  The  plaintiff has submitted\r\n\nno evidence suggesting  that he  was indigent on  any of  the\r\n\nfour days in question.\r\n\n          Second,  we  reject,  for  failure  of  proof,  the\r\n\nplaintiff's  challenge   to  the  constitutionality   of  the\r\n\nindigence threshold set by the inmate mail regulations.   The\r\n\nplaintiff argues that the district court should have inquired\r\n\ninto the \"cost of living\" in his prison facility and the need\r\n\nto  adjust  the  indigence  formula  for  inflation.    These\r\n\nomissions (if omissions at all)  are gaps in the  plaintiff's\r\n\nown case.  The record shows that the plaintiff spent the bulk\r\n\nof  his discretionary  income on  tobacco, snacks,  and soda,\r\n\nleaving approximately  20% for stamps  and writing  supplies.\r\r\n\nWe cannot say  on this  record that  the indigence  threshold\r\n\nundercuts the plaintiff's right of access to the courts.\r\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\r                                                                     \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
