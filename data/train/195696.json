Appellant, Michael Donegan,  appeals\n                    \n\nhis conviction  and sentence and the  district court's denial\n\nof his motion to reduce  and/or correct his sentence pursuant\n\nto  28 U.S.C.   2255.  In an order dated August 5, 1994, this\n\ncourt  consolidated these  two  appeals for  the purposes  of\n\nargument and the filing of pleadings.\n\n     Appellant   contends   that  the   sentence  enhancement\n\nprovision contained in 8 U.S.C.    1326(b)(2) does not  apply\n\nto him.  We reject that argument as  foreclosed by our recent\n\ndecision in United  States v.  Rodriquez, 26 F.3d  4, 6  (1st\n                                        \n\nCir. 1994),  and for  the reasons contained  in the  district\n\ncourt's  Memorandum  and  Order  dated  September  23,  1993.\n\nAppellant's  second ground  for appeal  is that  the district\n\ncourt  erred  in  failing  to reduce  his  offense-level  for\n\nacceptance of  responsibility pursuant  to Section   3E1.1 of\n\nthe United States Sentencing Guidelines.  For essentially the\n\nreasons stated  in the district court's  Memorandum and Order\n\ndated May 2, 1994, we conclude that denial of a reduction for\n\nacceptance of responsibility was not clear error.  \n\n     Accordingly,  we summarily  affirm pursuant  to Loc.  R.\n\n27.1 appellant's  conviction and  sentence and the  denial of\n\nhis   2255 motion.\n",
