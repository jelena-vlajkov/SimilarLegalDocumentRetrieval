The Fair Credit Reporting Act\n\nimposes   certain   obligations     on    entities    that   furnish   credit\n\ninformation to consumer credit reporting agencies (CRAs).              See 15\n\nU.S.C. § 1681s-2.         One such obligation is to investigate any\n\ndisputes over the completeness or accuracy of the information\n\nfurnished and then notify the CRA of any corrections -- but only if\n\nthe CRA, acting as a gatekeeper, has previously notified the\n\nfurnisher of the consumer's dispute.          Id.     § 1681s-2(b)(1).     By\n\ncontrast, \"[a] notice of disputed information provided directly by\n\nthe consumer to a furnisher does not trigger a furnisher's duties\n\nunder § 1681s-2(b).\" Chiang v. Verizon New England, Inc., 595 F.3d\n\n26, 35 n.8 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n           The   appeal    before   us    centers    on   this   distinction.\n\nPlaintiff Wen Chiang brought suit against FIA Card Services, N.A.\n\n(formerly known as MBNA America Bank, N.A.), after it allegedly\n\nreported delinquent payments on his credit card.1            Chiang disputes\n\nthe alleged delinquency report and claims that FIA, as a furnisher\n\nof credit information, violated § 1681s-2(b)(1) by failing to\n\nfollow up on that dispute with a further investigation.                   The\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment to FIA after finding no\n\nevidence that a CRA, rather than just Chiang himself, had ever\n\ncontacted FIA concerning Chiang's objections.             Chiang v. MBNA, 634\n\n\n\n     1\n      It is not clear from the record whether Chiang's account was\never actually reported as delinquent.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fF. Supp. 2d 164 (D. Mass. 2009).           Discerning exactly the same fatal\n\nhole in Chiang's case as the district court found, we affirm.2\n\n           Because the district court resolved the case on summary\n\njudgment, we review its decision de novo.                 Harrington v. City of\n\nNashua, 610 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2010).                We will affirm the entry\n\nof   summary    judgment    if,    after    we    have    drawn    all    reasonable\n\ninferences in the non-moving party's favor, the record reveals no\n\ngenuine issue of material fact that would prevent judgment for the\n\nmoving party as a matter of law.            Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2).\n\n           Deposed    representatives            from    the    three    major   CRAs\n\ntestified that they had never sent a dispute notification to FIA.\n\nConsistent with that testimony, an FIA vice president stated in an\n\naffidavit that FIA had never received one.                \"Once the moving party\n\navers an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's\n\ncase, the non-moving party must offer definite, competent evidence\n\nto rebut the motion.\"       Meuser v. Fed. Express Corp., 564 F.3d 507,\n\n515 (1st Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).                           The\n\nevidence Chiang offers, however, is a parade of irrelevancies.\n\n           He    first     seeks   to   discredit         the    CRAs'    deposition\n\ntestimony.     He argues that the agencies did not adequately account\n\n\n      2\n      This is not the first unsuccessful consumer challenge that\nthis plaintiff and his counsel have brought within this circuit.\nSee Chiang v. Verizon New England, Inc., 595 F.3d 26; Chiang v.\nBank of Am., No. 07-cv-11733-RWZ (D. Mass. Mar. 12, 2010); see also\nChiang v. Chase Bank USA, N.A., No. 07-cv-11931-NG (D. Mass. June\n12, 2008) (dismissal of claims and counterclaims after alternative\ndispute resolution settlement).\n\n                                        -3-\n\ffor the fact that, during the relevant time frame, FIA and its\n\ninstitutional predecessors MBNA and Bank of America were in the\n\nmidst of organizational changes that could have created confusion\n\nabout which entity actually provided the account.                 As proof, he\n\npoints to portions of the testimony where the CRA representatives\n\nappeared unfamiliar with the exact relationship between Bank of\n\nAmerica,      MBNA,   and   FIA.    According       to    Chiang,      a     dispute\n\nnotification could therefore have been sent to any of the three,\n\nwhile the agencies searched their records only for notifications\n\nsent to FIA.     Yet the agencies explained in their affidavits that\n\nsearches were conducted according to the consumer's account number,\n\nnot according to the recipient.3          Any search would therefore have\n\nturned   up    documents    addressed    to   any   of   the   three       entities.\n\nMoreover, FIA's affidavit explicitly confirmed that the \"records\n\nwould have contained all of the documents relating to the Account,\n\nirrespective of whether the documents were addressed to FIA, MBNA,\n\nor Bank of America.\"\n\n\n\n     3\n      The district court allowed FIA to supplement the record with\nthese affidavits after depositions had already been taken. Because\nthe CRA representatives had referred only to FIA in their sworn\ntestimony, the court requested additional discovery to clarify\nwhether the representatives had also searched for notice sent to\nFIA's affiliates MBNA and Bank of America. Chiang claims that the\ncourt erred in considering these supplementary affidavits, but he\nis mistaken.   \"A subsequent affidavit that merely explains, or\namplifies upon, opaque testimony given in a previous deposition is\nentitled to consideration in opposition to a motion for summary\njudgment.\" Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., Inc., 283 F.3d 11, 26\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                        -4-\n\f           Chiang generates much sound and fury arguing that these\n\naffidavits    conflict     with    the    CRA    representatives'        deposition\n\ntestimony, creating a triable issue of material fact. But all that\n\nthe purportedly contradictory testimony shows is that the deponents\n\nwere not as thoroughly knowledgeable about the relationship between\n\nBank of America, MBNA, and FIA as perhaps they ideally might be.\n\nEven construing that fact in Chiang's favor, it would have nothing\n\nto do with whether a search according to account number would turn\n\nup documents sent to any of them.              The result would have been the\n\nsame whether the agencies' representatives thought that the three\n\nentities were affiliates or unrelated competitors.                    There was no\n\nnotice   in   any     of   the    agencies'       records,    and     the    account\n\nnumber–based search would have found any that existed.                      The only\n\nreasonable inference is that no notice was ever sent.\n\n           Chiang's own documentary evidence is similarly beside the\n\npoint.   He points to complaints that he sent to CRAs, but these do\n\nnot   establish     that   the    agencies      ever   took   the    next   step   of\n\ncommunicating those complaints to the furnisher.                    As the district\n\ncourt aptly explained,\n\n           In their deposition testimony, two CRA\n           representatives explained that the receipt of\n           a consumer dispute does not automatically\n           trigger   notification   to   the   furnisher.\n           Rather, a consumer complaint initiates a\n           multi-step process which may or may not result\n           in contact with a particular furnisher. For\n           example, upon receipt of a consumer complaint\n           letter, the credit reporting agency will\n           perform an initial review to specifically\n\n                                         -5-\n\f                 identify the dispute; if the consumer's\n                 initial complaint is difficult to decipher,\n                 the agency will often contact the consumer\n                 asking for additional information before\n                 proceeding further.    An agency will often\n                 first check its records to ensure that the\n                 consumer's understanding of their account is\n                 accurate (i.e., whether an account which the\n                 consumer claims has been reported delinquent\n                 is indeed reporting as delinquent).    If the\n                 consumer's belief does not match what the\n                 agency sees on its review of the consumer's\n                 file, then the agency may seek to resolve the\n                 discrepancy on its own without contacting a\n                 furnisher (i.e., the agency may contact the\n                 consumer to let him or her know that their\n                 account is not listed as delinquent).\n\nChiang, 634 F. Supp. 2d at 171 (internal record citations omitted).\n\n                 He next offers a faxed communication he received from\n\nBank        of   America   regarding   his   account.   This   document's\n\nsignificance, according to Chiang, lies not in the typed content of\n\nthe fax itself but in Chiang's own handwritten note, allegedly\n\njotted down during a phone conversation with a Bank of America\n\ncustomer service representative, Sherry Wyman:          \"Ms. Sherry said\n\nall [corrections]4 has [sic] been sent to credit bureau and allow\n\n90–120 days to showing [sic] the credit report.          this is include\n\n[sic] all disputed, wrong reports that she has on file.          She also\n\ntold [sic] my account is open and not have any past due history\n\ntoo.\"       Here, too, there is no suggestion that a CRA had contacted\n\nFIA concerning the disputed information. Moreover, Wyman stated in\n\n\n        4\n      Chiang appears to have written a different word here, but he\nmaintains that he meant \"corrections.\" The choice of words does\nnot alter the analysis.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fher affidavit that, at the time of the alleged phone call, she was\n\nnot working in the credit bureau dispute department and would not\n\nhave handled a credit bureau dispute from Chiang or anyone else.\n\n           Chiang's final piece of evidence is a pair of letters\n\nthat Equifax, one of the CRAs, sent to him.                These letters\n\nacknowledge completion of Chiang's requested investigation of his\n\ncredit file and explain that Equifax had \"contacted each source\n\ndirectly.\" Chiang insists that a reasonable juror could infer from\n\nthese letters that Equifax had indeed contacted FIA.          But even if\n\nEquifax had contacted FIA in some capacity, other language in the\n\nletters makes it unreasonable to infer that Equifax had sent notice\n\nabout the particular dispute at issue here. The letters proceed to\n\nexplain that the credit card account was \"reporting as OPEN\" and\n\n\"paid as agreed, with no late payments,\" rather than delinquent;\n\nbecause the predicate for Chiang's complaint was nowhere to be\n\nfound, it is rather unlikely that Equifax would have identified the\n\ndispute as requiring formal communication to FIA.            Indeed, the\n\nletters also mention two disputes with Verizon, noting that \"[t]his\n\ncreditor has verified to Equifax that the balance is being reported\n\ncorrectly\" -- a sentence conspicuously absent from the paragraph\n\ndealing with the FIA account.         That Equifax memorialized this\n\nverification only when discussing the Verizon disputes and not the\n\nFIA   dispute   suggests   that   Equifax   actually    communicated   the\n\nrelevant dispute to Verizon but not to FIA.            Hence, by negative\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fimplication, these letters actually cut against the proposition\n\nthat Chiang believes them to support.5\n\n\n\nAffirmed.   Costs to appellees.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      Chiang also highlights the letters' use of the word\n\"reinvestigate,\" which appears to suggest that Equifax had in fact\nconducted some prior investigation of the dispute.              But\n\"reinvestigation\" is a term of art in the Fair Credit Reporting Act\nand refers only to a CRA's reevaluation of a consumer's credit\nreport in light of a consumer's dispute, not a second\ninvestigation.    See 15 U.S.C. § 1681i(a)(1)(A) (\"[I]f the\ncompleteness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a\nconsumer's file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the\nconsumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or\nindirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, the agency shall,\nfree of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine\nwhether the disputed information is inaccurate . . . .\").\n\n                                  -8-\n\f",

One such obligation is to investigate any disputes over the completeness or accuracy of the information furnished and then notify the CRA of any correctionsbut only if the CRA, acting as a gatekeeper, has previously notified the furnisher of the consumer's dispute. <i>Id.</i> § 1681s-2(b)(1). By contrast, \"[a] notice of disputed information provided directly by the consumer to a furnisher does not trigger a furnisher's duties under § 1681s-2(b).\" <i>Chiang v. Verizon New England, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">595</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></span>, 35 n. 8 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>The appeal before us centers on this distinction. Plaintiff Wen Chiang brought suit against FIA Card Services, N.A. (formerly known as MBNA America Bank, N.A.), after it allegedly reported delinquent payments on his credit card.<sup>[1]</sup> Chiang disputes the alleged delinquency report and claims that FIA, as a furnisher of credit information, violated § 1681s-2(b)(1) by failing to follow up on that dispute with a further investigation. The district court granted summary judgment to FIA after finding no evidence that a CRA, rather than just Chiang himself, had ever contacted FIA concerning Chiang's objections. <i>Chiang v. MBNA</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1885713\"><a href=\"/opinion/1885713/chiang-v-mbna/\"><span class=\"volume\">634</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span> </a></span>(D.Mass.2009). Discerning exactly the same fatal hole in Chiang's case as the district court found, we affirm.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> Because the district court resolved the case on summary judgment, we review its decision de novo. <i>Harrington v. City of Nashua,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"149678\"><a href=\"/opinion/149678/harrington-v-city-of-nashua/\"><span class=\"volume\">610</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.2010). We will affirm the entry of summary judgment if, after we have drawn all reasonable inferences in the non-moving party's favor, the record reveals no genuine issue of material fact that would prevent judgment for the moving party as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(2).</p>\n<p>Deposed representatives from the three major CRAs testified that they had never sent a dispute notification to FIA. Consistent with that testimony, an FIA vice president stated in an affidavit that FIA had never received one. \"Once the moving party avers an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case, the non-moving party must offer definite, competent evidence to rebut the motion.\" <i>Meuser v. Fed. Express Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203801\"><a href=\"/opinion/203801/meuser-v-federal-express-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 515 (1st Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). The evidence Chiang offers, however, is a parade of irrelevancies.</p>\n<p>He first seeks to discredit the CRAs' deposition testimony. He argues that the agencies did not adequately account for the fact that, during the relevant time frame, FIA and its institutional predecessors MBNA and Bank of America were in the midst of organizational changes that could have created confusion about which entity actually provided the account. As proof, he points to portions of the testimony where the CRA representatives appeared unfamiliar with the exact relationship between Bank of America, MBNA, and FIA. According to Chiang, a dispute notification could therefore have been sent to any of the three, while the agencies searched their records only for notifications sent to FIA. Yet the agencies explained in their affidavits that searches were conducted according to the consumer's account number, not according to the recipient.<sup>[3]</sup> Any search would therefore have turned up documents addressed to any of the three entities. Moreover, FIA's affidavit explicitly confirmed that the \"records would have contained all of the documents relating to the Account, irrespective of whether the documents were addressed to FIA, MBNA, or Bank of America.\"</p>\n<p>Chiang generates much sound and fury arguing that these affidavits conflict with the CRA representatives' deposition testimony, creating a triable issue of material fact. But all that the purportedly contradictory testimony shows is that the deponents were not as thoroughly knowledgeable about the relationship between Bank of America, MBNA, and FIA as perhaps they ideally might be. Even construing that fact in Chiang's favor, it would have nothing to do with whether a search according to account number would turn up documents sent to any of them. The result would have been the same whether the agencies' representatives thought that the three entities were affiliates or unrelated competitors. There was no notice in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> any of the agencies' records, and the account number-based search would have found any that existed. The only reasonable inference is that no notice was ever sent.</p>\n<p>Chiang's own documentary evidence is similarly beside the point. He points to complaints that he sent to CRAs, but these do not establish that the agencies ever took the next step of communicating those complaints to the furnisher. As the district court aptly explained,</p>\n<blockquote>In their deposition testimony, two CRA representatives explained that the receipt of a consumer dispute does not automatically trigger notification to the furnisher. Rather, a consumer complaint initiates a multi-step process which may or may not result in contact with a particular furnisher. For example, upon receipt of a consumer complaint letter, the credit reporting agency will perform an initial review to specifically identify the dispute; if the consumer's initial complaint is difficult to decipher, the agency will often contact the consumer asking for additional information before proceeding further. An agency will often first check its records to ensure that the consumer's understanding of their account is accurate (i.e., whether an account which the consumer claims has been reported delinquent is indeed reporting as delinquent). If the consumer's belief does not match what the agency sees on its review of the consumer's file, then the agency may seek to resolve the discrepancy on its own without contacting a furnisher (i.e., the agency may contact the consumer to let him or her know that their account is not listed as delinquent).</blockquote>\n<p><i>Chiang,</i> 634 F.Supp.2d at 171 (internal record citations omitted).</p>\n<p>He next offers a faxed communication he received from Bank of America regarding his account. This document's significance, according to Chiang, lies not in the typed content of the fax itself but in Chiang's own handwritten note, allegedly jotted down during a phone conversation with a Bank of America customer service representative, Sherry Wyman: \"Ms. Sherry said all [corrections]<sup>[4]</sup> has [sic] been sent to credit bureau and allow 90-120 days to showing [sic] the credit report, this is include [sic] all disputed, wrong reports that she has on file. She also told [sic] my account is open and not have any past due history too.\" Here, too, there is no suggestion that a CRA had contacted FIA concerning the disputed information. Moreover, Wyman stated in her affidavit that, at the time of the alleged phone call, she was not working in the credit bureau dispute department and would not have handled a credit bureau dispute from Chiang or anyone else.</p>\n<p>Chiang's final piece of evidence is a pair of letters that Equifax, one of the CRAs, sent to him. These letters acknowledge completion of Chiang's requested investigation of his credit file and explain that Equifax had \"contacted each source directly.\" Chiang insists that a reasonable juror could infer from these letters that Equifax had indeed contacted FIA. But even if Equifax had contacted FIA in some capacity, other language in the letters makes it unreasonable to infer that Equifax had sent notice about the particular dispute at issue here. The letters proceed to explain that the credit card account was \"reporting as OPEN\" and \"paid as agreed, with no late payments,\" rather than delinquent; because the predicate for Chiang's complaint was nowhere to be found, it is rather unlikely that Equifax would have identified <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> the dispute as requiring formal communication to FIA. Indeed, the letters also mention two disputes with Verizon, noting that \"[t]his creditor has verified to Equifax that the balance is being reported correctly\"a sentence conspicuously absent from the paragraph dealing with the FIA account. That Equifax memorialized this verification only when discussing the Verizon disputes and not the FIA dispute suggests that Equifax actually communicated the relevant dispute to Verizon but not to FIA. Hence, by negative implication, these letters actually cut against the proposition that Chiang believes them to support.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i> Costs to appellees.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  It is not clear from the record whether Chiang's account was ever actually reported as delinquent.</p>\n<p>[2]  This is not the first unsuccessful consumer challenge that this plaintiff and his counsel have brought within this circuit. <i>See </i><i>Chiang v. Verizon New England, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">595</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></span>; <i>Chiang v.

June 12, 2008) (dismissal of claims and counterclaims after alternative dispute resolution settlement).</p>\n<p>[3]  The district court allowed FIA to supplement the record with these affidavits after depositions had already been taken. Because the CRA representatives had referred only to FIA in their sworn testimony, the court requested additional discovery to clarify whether the representatives had also searched for notice sent to FIA's affiliates MBNA and Bank of America. Chiang claims that the court erred in considering these supplementary affidavits, but he is mistaken. \"A subsequent affidavit that merely explains, or amplifies upon, opaque testimony given in a previous deposition is entitled to consideration in opposition to a motion for summary judgment.\" <i>Gillen v.
