In  this legal  malpractice action,  the\r                    Per  Curiam.\r                               \n\ndistrict  court   granted  summary  judgment  in   favor  of  the\n\ndefendants (a lawyer and his law firm), citing  two independently\n\nsufficient reasons.  See  Best v. Rome, 858 F.  Supp. 271, 274-78\r                                                \n\n(D.  Mass.  1994).    Having carefully  considered  the  parties'\n\nbriefs, perused  the record, and  studied the applicable  law, we\n\nshare the district  court's conclusion, id.  at 277-78, that  the\r                                                     \n\nrecord  reveals no genuine issue of material fact on the question\n\nof malpractice.  Thus, regardless of how the other issues  in the\n\ncase  might be resolved   a matter on which we take no view   the\n\njudgment below must be upheld.\n\n          We  need go no further.   As we  have indicated before,\n\nwhen  a  district court  produces  a  well-reasoned opinion  that\n\nreaches  the correct result in a given case, a reviewing tribunal\n\nshould not rush  to write at length merely to  put matters in its\n\nown words.

Because\r                \n\nwe  agree with  the court below  that, in this  case, the summary\n\njudgment  record contains  no  evidence sufficient  to support  a\n\ncolorable claim of  professional negligence, we  summarily affirm\n\nthe judgment below, for  substantially the reasons articulated in\n\nthe district court's alternative holding.  See Best, 858 F. Supp.\r                                                             \n\nat 277-78.   We add only that, despite  our summary affirmance of\n\nthe judgment below,  we do  not regard the  appeal as so  utterly\n\nlacking  in  merit  as  to  warrant  the  imposition  of  special\n\npenalties.  We, therefore, deny\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n the  defendants' request  for  sanctions,  but award  defendants\n\ntheir ordinary costs.\n\nAffirmed.  See  1st Cir. R. 27.1.
