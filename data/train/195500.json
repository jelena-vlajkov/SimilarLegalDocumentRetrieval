We con-\n\nclude that the plea acceptance procedure adopted by  the district\n\ncourt  met neither  the letter  nor the  spirit of  Rule 11.   As\n\nappellant's  guilty plea was  invalid, we remand  to the district\n\ncourt for further proceedings.   \n\n                                I\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          The Rule 11 hearing  transcript discloses the following\n\ncolloquy: \n\n          THE  COURT: .  . .

The dis-\n\ntrict court record discloses no other information relevant to the\n\ncontent and sufficiency of  the Rule 11 colloquy.   Medina inter-\n\nposed no objection to  the district court procedure.   See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Parra-Ibanez, 936 F.2d 588, 593 (1st Cir. 1991) (appel-\n                      \n\nlate court  must determine Rule  11 compliance without  regard to\n\nwhether the issue was raised below). \n\n          Appellant contends  that  the district  court's  simple\n\nincorporation  of the Petition to  Enter a Plea  of Guilty denied\n\nhim the procedural safeguards  prescribed by Rule 11.   He argues\n\nthat the failure to conduct a full and direct examination in open\n\ncourt  compromised \"core\"  Rule  11 concerns  and undermined  the\n\nvalidity of the  guilty plea.  See  United States v. Allard,  926\n                                                           \n\nF.2d 1237,  1244-45  (1st Cir.  1991) (identifying  core Rule  11\n\nconcerns:  absence  of coercion,  understanding  of  charges, and\n\nknowledge  of  consequences of  guilty  plea).   Further,  Medina\n\nclaims  that comments he made  during the Rule  11 hearing demon-\n\n                                3\n\nstrate that his guilty plea was  not \"voluntary and intelligent.\"\n\nSee, e.g., Parra-Ibanez, 936 F.2d at 590 (noting that the \"stric-\n                       \n\ntures  of Rule 11 [were]  calculated to insure  the voluntary and\n\nintelligent character of the plea\").  \n\n          The government  responds that  the Petition to  Enter a\n\nPlea of Guilty was completed by appellant, with the assistance of\n\ncounsel, only moments before the Rule 11 hearing.  The government\n\ntherefore claims  that  any error  was harmless  and affected  no\n\nsubstantial  rights.  See Fed.  R. Crim. P.  11(h) (\"Any variance\n                         \n\nfrom the procedures required  by this rule which does  not affect\n\nsubstantial rights shall be disregarded.\").

Similarly, the Supreme Court has left no  room to doubt\n\nthe central  importance of  direct interrogation by  the district\n\njudge  in determining  whether to  accept the  defendant's guilty\n\nplea:\n\n          To the  extent that the  district judge  thus\n          exposes the defendant's state  of mind on the\n          record through personal interrogation, he not\n          only  facilitates his own  determination of a\n          guilty  plea's  voluntariness,  but  he  also\n          facilitates that determination in  any subse-\n          quent post-conviction proceeding based upon a\n          claim that the plea was involuntary.  Both of\n          these goals  are undermined in  proportion to\n          the  degree  the  district  judge  resorts to\n          \"assumptions\" not based upon recorded respon-\n                                                       \n          ses to his inquiries.  \n                              \n\nMcCarthy v.

It is still true, as the Supreme\n\n                                6\n\nCourt  pointed  out  in  McCarthy, that  thoughtful  and  careful\n                                 \n\ncompliance with  Rule 11 best serves the  cause of fair and effi-\n\ncient administration of criminal  justice . . . .\")  (emphasis in\n\noriginal).   The present case is directly  in point.  But for the\n\ndistrict court's failure to  follow the explicit requirements set\n\nout in Rule 11, in all likelihood no post-conviction challenge to\n\nthe validity of appellant's guilty plea would ever have occurred.\n\nThus,  it is  \"not too  much to  require that,  before sentencing\n\ndefendants to years of imprisonment, district judges take the few\n\nminutes necessary to inform them of their rights and to determine\n\nwhether they understand  the action they are taking.\"   McCarthy,\n                                                                \n\n394 U.S. at 472.         We  well  understand  the heavy  burdens\n\nimposed on the district courts.  Yet no matter how repetitive the\n\nrequired Rule 11 praxis  may become for busy district  judges, it\n\nmay  not  be presumed  so for  the  defendant; and  however time-\n\nconsuming for the court, it is surely less so than the  virtually\n\ncertain  prospect of remand  for further  Rule 11  proceedings or\n\ntrial.  There is no \"talismanic test,\" Allard,  926 F.2d at 1245,\n                                             \n\nand we have never held the district courts to a formula of \"magic\n\nwords\" in meeting the requirements of  Rule 11.  It is abundantly\n\nclear,  however,  that the  procedure  employed  below cannot  be\n\nconsidered in  substantial compliance with Rule  11.1 \"[A] viola-\n\n                    \n\n     1\"By entering a guilty plea, a  defendant, in effect, waives\na number  of constitutional rights.

The district court record discloses no other information relevant to the content and sufficiency of the Rule 11 colloquy.  Medina interposed no objection to the district court procedure.  See United States v. Parra-Ibanez, 936 F.2d 588, 593 (1st Cir.1991) (appellate court must determine Rule 11 compliance without regard to whether the issue was raised below).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that the district court's simple incorporation of the Petition to Enter a Plea of Guilty denied him the procedural safeguards prescribed by Rule 11.  He argues that the failure to conduct a full and direct examination in open court compromised \"core\" Rule 11 concerns and undermined the validity of the guilty plea.  See United States v. Allard, 926 F.2d 1237, 1244-45 (1st Cir.1991) (identifying core Rule 11 concerns:  absence of coercion, understanding of charges, and knowledge of consequences of guilty plea).  Further, Medina claims that comments he made during the Rule 11 hearing demonstrate that his guilty plea was not \"voluntary and intelligent.\"   See, e.g., Parra-Ibanez, 936 F.2d at 590 (noting that the \"strictures of Rule 11 [were] calculated to insure the voluntary and intelligent character of the plea\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responds that the Petition to Enter a Plea of Guilty was completed by appellant, with the assistance of counsel, only moments before the Rule 11 hearing.  The government therefore claims that any error was harmless and affected no substantial rights.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(h) (\"Any variance from the procedures required by this rule which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\").

The court shall not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere without first, by addressing the defendant personally in open court, determining that the plea is voluntary and not the result of force or threats or of promises apart from a plea agreement.   The court shall also inquire as to whether the defendant's willingness to plead guilty or nolo contendere results from prior discussions between the attorney for the government and the defendant or the defendant's attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c), (d) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court procedure adopted in this case cannot be harmonized with the plain language of Rule 11(c), (d).  At a Rule 11 plea hearing, \"the court must address the defendant personally in open court and inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands,\" the matters enumerated in Rule 11.  Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 advisory committee's notes accompanying 1966 amendment (explaining that the rule was amended to make express the requirement that the district judge personally address the defendant to ascertain that the plea is \"voluntary and intelligent\").  The authorities are in agreement that reliance on \"a written document is not a sufficient substitute for personal examination [by the court.]\"  James W. Moore, 8 Moore's Federal Practice p 11.05 (1994);  Charles A. Wright, 1 Federal Practice &amp; Procedure Sec. 172 (1982) (\"Since 1966 the rule has required the court to address the defendant personally.\");   see also United States v. Del Prete, 567 F.2d 928, 930 (9th Cir.1978) (\"[a] written document is emphatically not a substitute for the clear dictate of the rule, which requires that the trial judge address the defendant in open court\").  Similarly, the Supreme Court has left no room to doubt the central importance of direct interrogation by the district judge in determining whether to accept the defendant's guilty plea:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>To the extent that the district judge thus exposes the defendant's state of mind on the record through personal interrogation, he not only facilitates his own determination of a guilty plea's voluntariness, but he also facilitates that determination in any subsequent post-conviction proceeding based upon a claim that the plea was involuntary.  Both of these goals are undermined in proportion to the degree the district judge resorts to \"assumptions\" not based upon recorded responses to his inquiries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 467, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 1171, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969) (emphasis added);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 advisory committee's notes accompanying 1983 amendment (\"[S]ubdivision (h) should not be read as an invitation to trial judges to take a more casual approach to Rule 11 procedures.  It is still true, as the Supreme Court pointed out in McCarthy, that thoughtful and careful compliance with Rule 11 best serves the cause of fair and efficient administration of criminal justice....\") (emphasis in original).  The present case is directly in point.  But for the district court's failure to follow the explicit requirements set out in Rule 11, in all likelihood no post-conviction challenge to the validity of appellant's guilty plea would ever have occurred.  Thus, it is \"not too much to require that, before sentencing defendants to years of imprisonment, district judges take the few minutes necessary to inform them of their rights and to determine whether they understand the action they are taking.\"  McCarthy, 394 U.S. at 472, 89 S.Ct. at 1174.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We well understand the heavy burdens imposed on the district courts.  Yet no matter how repetitive the required Rule 11 praxis may become for busy district judges, it may not be presumed so for the defendant;  and however time-consuming for the court, it is surely less so than the virtually certain prospect of remand for further Rule 11 proceedings or trial.  There is no \"talismanic test,\" Allard, 926 F.2d at 1245, and we have never held the district courts to a formula of \"magic words\" in meeting the requirements of Rule 11.

The district court record discloses no other information relevant to the content and sufficiency of the Rule 11 colloquy.  Medina interposed no objection to the district court procedure.  See United States v. Parra-Ibanez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563642\"><a href=\"/opinion/563642/united-states-v-francisco-j-parra-ibanez/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span>, 593 (1st Cir.1991) (appellate court must determine Rule 11 compliance without regard to whether the issue was raised below).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that the district court's simple incorporation of the Petition to Enter a Plea of Guilty denied him the procedural safeguards prescribed by Rule 11.  He argues that the failure to conduct a full and direct examination in open court compromised \"core\" Rule 11 concerns and undermined the validity of the guilty plea.  See United States v. Allard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556604\"><a href=\"/opinion/556604/united-states-v-raymond-p-allard/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1237</span></a></span>, 1244-45 (1st Cir.1991) (identifying core Rule 11 concerns:  absence of coercion, understanding of charges, and knowledge of consequences of guilty plea).  Further, Medina claims that comments he made during the Rule 11 hearing demonstrate that his guilty plea was not \"voluntary and intelligent.\"   See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563642\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Parra-Ibanez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/563642/united-states-v-francisco-j-parra-ibanez/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">590</span> </a></span>(noting that the \"strictures of Rule 11 [were] calculated to insure the voluntary and intelligent character of the plea\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responds that the Petition to Enter a Plea of Guilty was completed by appellant, with the assistance of counsel, only moments before the Rule 11 hearing.  The government therefore claims that any error was harmless and affected no substantial rights.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(h) (\"Any variance from the procedures required by this rule which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\").

The court shall not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere without first, by addressing the defendant personally in open court, determining that the plea is voluntary and not the result of force or threats or of promises apart from a plea agreement.   The court shall also inquire as to whether the defendant's willingness to plead guilty or nolo contendere results from prior discussions between the attorney for the government and the defendant or the defendant's attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c), (d) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court procedure adopted in this case cannot be harmonized with the plain language of Rule 11(c), (d).  At a Rule 11 plea hearing, \"the court must address the defendant personally in open court and inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands,\" the matters enumerated in Rule 11.  Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 advisory committee's notes accompanying 1966 amendment (explaining that the rule was amended to make express the requirement that the district judge personally address the defendant to ascertain that the plea is \"voluntary and intelligent\").  The authorities are in agreement that reliance on \"a written document is not a sufficient substitute for personal examination [by the court.]\"  James W. Moore, 8 Moore's Federal Practice p 11.05 (1994);  Charles A. Wright, 1 Federal Practice &amp; Procedure Sec. 172 (1982) (\"Since 1966 the rule has required the court to address the defendant personally.\");   see also United States v.

Similarly, the Supreme Court has left no room to doubt the central importance of direct interrogation by the district judge in determining whether to accept the defendant's guilty plea:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>To the extent that the district judge thus exposes the defendant's state of mind on the record through personal interrogation, he not only facilitates his own determination of a guilty plea's voluntariness, but he also facilitates that determination in any subsequent post-conviction proceeding based upon a claim that the plea was involuntary.  Both of these goals are undermined in proportion to the degree the district judge resorts to \"assumptions\" not based upon recorded responses to his inquiries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCarthy v.

The present case is directly in point.  But for the district court's failure to follow the explicit requirements set out in Rule 11, in all likelihood no post-conviction challenge to the validity of appellant's guilty plea would ever have occurred.  Thus, it is \"not too much to require that, before sentencing defendants to years of imprisonment, district judges take the few minutes necessary to inform them of their rights and to determine whether they understand the action they are taking.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107892\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">McCarthy,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/107892/mccarthy-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span>, 89 S.Ct. at 1174.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We well understand the heavy burdens imposed on the district courts.
