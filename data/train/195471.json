Gearreald and Engel, Gearreald  &amp; Gardner, P.A. on  brief\n                                                        \nfor appellees.\n\n                                         \n\n                         July 8, 1994\n                                         \n\n          Per Curiam.    In  1993,  Alfred  F.  Cote,  a  New\n                    \n\nHampshire inmate,  filed this action  under 42 U.S.C.    1983\n\nclaiming  that Vetter,  a  county  sheriff,  and  two  deputy\n\nsheriffs,    Janvrine    and     Powers,    had    manifested\n\nunconstitutional   conduct   when    they   executed   Cote's\n\nextradition to Illinois on July 22, 1987.  The district court\n\ndismissed the suit as untimely.  We affirm.\n\n          The parties do  not dispute that New  Hampshire law\n\napplies to this case.   Although Cote has attempted to invoke\n\nother statutory  limitations periods, New  Hampshire's three-\n\nyear  personal injury statute of limitations, N.H. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn.  (RSA) 508:4,  governs this    1983  action.   Wilson v.\n                                                          \n\nGarcia, 471  U.S. 261,  276-80 (1985)  (state law  limitation\n      \n\nperiod, tolling  and revival  provisions apply).   As  Cote's\n\nclaim arose  out of  the events  surrounding his  extradition\n\nfrom  New  Hampshire  to  Illinois  on  July  22,  1987,  the\n\nlimitations period  under RSA 508:4 expired on July 22, 1991.\n\nThus,  this action,  filed on  January  26, 1993  in the  New\n\nHampshire federal district  court, is barred unless  Cote can\n\ntake advantage of New Hampshire's saving statute, RSA 508:10.\n\nThe statute, entitled \"Second Suit\", provides:\n\n               If judgment is rendered against\n               the  plaintiff  in   an  action\n               brought within the time limited\n               therefor,  or  upon a  writ  of\n               error thereon, and the right of\n               action  is  not barred  by  the\n               judgment, a  new action  may be\n               brought  thereon  in  one  year\n\n                             -2-\n\n               after the judgment.\n\nWhile the  statute is \"designed  to insure a  diligent suitor\n\nthe right to a hearing  in court until he reaches a  judgment\n\non the  merits,\" Adams  v. Sullivan, 110  N.H. 101,  105, 261\n                                   \n\nA.2d  273, 276  (1970),  \"[o]nly where  the cause  has become\n\nbarred by the general limitation [RSA 510:4] does a plaintiff\n\nhave occasion  to rely upon  RSA 508:10.\"  Hughes  v. Hebert,\n                                                            \n\n106 N.H. 176,  178, 207 A.2d 432,  433 (1965).  Thus,  when a\n\ntimely action is later dismissed \"for reasons not barring the\n\nright of action  or determining it on its merits,\" id., a new\n                                                      \n\naction,  arising out of  the same transaction  or occurrence,\n\nmay be brought  within a year of the  judgment, providing the\n\ngeneral limitation period will or has run.\n\n          According to  Cote, this complaint was  first filed\n\nagainst  these defendants,  and others,  in federal  district\n\ncourt in the  Northern District of Illinois on  June 1, 1988.\n\nOn February  8, 1989, the court granted defendants' motion to\n\ndismiss  concluding,  inter  alia,  that  it  lacked personal\n                                 \n\njurisdiction  over Vetter,  Powers and Janvrine  because they\n\nhad not  performed any acts in Illinois.   Cote v. Kontos, et\n                                                             \n\nal., No. 88-C-4751,  Memorandum Opinion and Order  (N.D. Ill.\n   \n\nFeb.  7,  1989).    Cote's  appeal  from  that  judgment  was\n\nvoluntarily  dismissed under Fed. R. App.  P. 42(b) on August\n\n21, 1990.\n\n          Clearly,  when  judgment  entered in  the  Illinois\n\n                             -3-\n\nfederal  district court on  February 7, 1989,  the three-year\n\nlimitation period had  not yet expired, precluding  operation\n\nof the saving statute.  Even if  we were to consider the date\n\nof the voluntary dismissal of the appeal, August 21, 1990, as\n\nthe  operative \"judgment\" under  RSA 508:10, Cote  would have\n\nonly derived an additional year  to revive his suit, that is,\n\nuntil August 21, 1991.1  Thus, under  either scenario, Cote's\n\naction is untimely and was properly dismissed.\n\n          Cote attempts to avoid this result by pointing to a\n\nthird and intervening   1983 action which he filed in the New\n\nHampshire district court in April 1990, within the three-year\n\nlimitation period.   Cote v. Rockingham  County, et al.,  No.\n                                                       \n\n90-CV-152.   Vetter, Powers, and Janvrine were not originally\n\nnamed defendants in that action.  Cote was allowed to file an\n\namended  complaint naming  them.   However,  on September  2,\n\n1992, that amended  complaint was dismissed by  a magistrate-\n\njudge and the case proceeded against the original defendants.\n\nCote  has represented  in this  complaint,  and argues  here,\n\nthat, in recommending  dismissal of the amended  complaint in\n\nNo.  90-CV-152,  the  district court  had  \"ordered\"  Cote to\n\nremove   and  refile   a  separate   complaint  against   the\n\ndefendants.   However,  no  such \"order\"  ever  issued.   The\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  defendants-appellees  argue  that the  dismissal  in\nIllinois for lack  of personal jurisdiction  would not, as  a\nmatter of law, implicate RSA 508:10.  However, we see no need\nto reach that issue.\n\n                             -4-\n\ndistrict  court's  November  4,  1992  clarification  of  its\n\nSeptember 2, 1992 recommendation states in part:\n\n               The  relevant  issues  in  this\n               case do  not include,  and will\n               not  include,  any  issues that\n               have  been  finally  determined\n               during   proceedings   in   the\n               United  States  District  Court\n               for  the  Northern  District of\n               Illinois.  Plaintiff is free to\n               file any other  actions in this\n               court  as  he  wishes; however,\n               each    will   be    separately\n               screened and each will be dealt\n               with without  reference to  the\n               others.     The  court   cannot\n               estimate the time  it will take\n               to   deal   with    newly-filed\n               actions.  Such  a determination\n               will depend on many intervening\n               factors.\n\nJudgment entered on  May 16, 1994, and while  Cote may appeal\n\nthe dismissal of these defendants  in that case, the time for\n                                          \n\nsuing  them in this complaint  had clearly expired on January\n                   \n\n26, 1993.   We have no occasion to decide  whether RSA 508:10\n\nor any other tolling provision  would apply to stop the clock\n\nand  defeat a  potential statute  of  limitations defense  in\n\nCote's intervening action.\n\n          We have considered  appellant's remaining arguments\n\nand find them without merit.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -5-\n",

As Cote's claim arose out of the events surrounding his extradition from New Hampshire to Illinois on July 22, 1987, the limitations period under RSA 508:4 expired on July 22, 1991.

Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2175252\"><a href=\"/opinion/2175252/adams-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 105, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></span>, 276 (1970), \"[o]nly where the cause has become barred by the general limitation [RSA 510:4] does a plaintiff have occasion to rely upon RSA 508:10.\"   Hughes v. Hebert, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2402588\"><a href=\"/opinion/2402588/hughes-v-hebert/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span>, 178, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></span>, 433 (1965).  Thus, when a timely action is later dismissed \"for reasons not barring the right of action or determining it on its merits,\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> a new </span>action, arising out of the same transaction or occurrence, may be brought within a year of the judgment, providing the general limitation period will or has run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Cote, this complaint was first filed against these defendants, and others, in federal district court in the Northern District of Illinois on June 1, 1988.  On February 8, 1989, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss concluding, inter alia, that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Vetter, Powers and Janvrine because they had not performed any acts in Illinois.  Cote v. Kontos, et al., No. 88-C-4751, Memorandum Opinion and Order (N.D. Ill.  Feb. 7, 1989).  Cote's appeal from that judgment was voluntarily dismissed under Fed.  R. App.  P. 42(b) on August 21, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clearly, when judgment entered in the Illinois federal district court on February 7, 1989, the three-year limitation period had not yet expired, precluding operation of the saving statute.  Even if we were to consider the date of the voluntary dismissal of the appeal, August 21, 1990, as the operative \"judgment\" under RSA 508:10, Cote would have only derived an additional year to revive his suit, that is, until August 21, 1991.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Thus, under either scenario, Cote's action is untimely and was properly dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cote attempts to avoid this result by pointing to a third and intervening Sec. 1983 action which he filed in the New Hampshire district court in April 1990, within the three-year limitation period.  Cote v. Rockingham County, et al., No. 90-CV-152.  Vetter, Powers, and Janvrine were not originally named defendants in that action.  Cote was allowed to file an amended complaint naming them.  However, on September 2, 1992, that amended complaint was dismissed by a magistrate- judge and the case proceeded against the original defendants.  Cote has represented in this complaint, and argues here, that, in recommending dismissal of the amended complaint in No. 90-CV-152, the district court had \"ordered\" Cote to remove and refile a separate complaint against the defendants.  However, no such \"order\" ever issued.  The district court's November 4, 1992 clarification of its September 2, 1992 recommendation states in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant issues in this case do not include, and will not include, any issues that have been finally determined during proceedings in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  Plaintiff is free to file any other actions in this court as he wishes;  however, each will be separately screened and each will be dealt with without reference to the others.  The court cannot estimate the time it will take to deal with newly-filed actions.  Such a determination will depend on many intervening factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment entered on May 16, 1994, and while Cote may appeal the dismissal of these defendants in that case, the time for suing them in this complaint had clearly expired on January 26, 1993.  We have no occasion to decide whether RSA 508:10 or any other tolling provision would apply to stop the clock and defeat a potential statute of limitations defense in Cote's intervening action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered appellant's remaining arguments and find them without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The defendants-appellees argue that the dismissal in Illinois for lack of personal jurisdiction would not, as a matter of law, implicate RSA 508:10.  However, we see no need to reach that issue</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
