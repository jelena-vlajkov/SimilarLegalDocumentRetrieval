Plaintiff Peter Georgacarakos filed an\n                    \n\naction  against state  prison officials  and a  deputy United\n\nStates Marshal.  He premised  his claims on 42 U.S.C.    1983\n\nand  the Fifth  Amendment.   Upon  the  recommendations of  a\n\nmagistrate judge,  the district court granted  the motions to\n\ndismiss of two of  the defendants and the motion  for summary\n\njudgment of the remaining defendants.\n\n          We  have  carefully  reviewed the  record  and  the\n\nbriefs of the parties and affirm the judgment of the district\n\ncourt for  essentially the  reasons stated in  the magistrate\n\njudge's  Recommended  Dispositions  of  the  two  motions  to\n\ndismiss, Docket #27 and  #53, and the Recommended Disposition\n\nof the  motion for  summary judgment,  docket #54,  which the\n\ndistrict court judge adopted.
