After\n\nthe  visa expired, he remained in the United States and, over\n\nthe  next  five  years,  was  convicted  of  several  crimes,\n\nincluding robbery.   During  this period, Abrams,  who speaks\n\nand reads English, briefly attended college.  In 1986, Abrams\n\nfiled  for an adjustment of status seeking to become a lawful\n\npermanent resident.   By decision dated January  7, 1987, the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization  Service (INS) denied Abrams's\n\npetition, but permitted him to leave the country voluntarily,\n\nthus avoiding deportation proceedings.  \n\n          Notwithstanding this concession,  Abrams chose  not\n\nto  leave.  In July 1987, Abrams  and Andrea Gardner, whom he\n\nnever married,  had a son who is a United States citizen.  In\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  In pertinent part,   1326 provides that any alien who has\nbeen  arrested and  deported  and later  reenters the  United\nStates without the Attorney  General's consent shall be fined\nor imprisoned, or both.  8  U.S.C.   1326(a).  An alien whose\ndeportation \"was subsequent to a conviction for commission of\nthree  or more misdemeanors  involving drugs,  crimes against\nthe  person, or both, or  a felony (other  than an aggravated\nfelony),\"  shall be  fined or  imprisoned  not more  than ten\nyears, or both.  8 U.S.C.   1326(b)(1).\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nOctober 1988, a  New York state  court convicted Abrams2  for\n\ncriminal  possession  of  a  weapon,  criminal possession  of\n\nstolen property,  and bail jumping.   In October  1989, while\n\nincarcerated in New York  state prison, Abrams married Angela\n\nMorgan, a United States citizen, with whom he had been living\n\nprior  to  the 1988  conviction.   On  March 13,  1990, while\n\nAbrams was  still in  prison, the INS  instituted deportation\n\nproceedings against him.3 \n\n          Two   deportation  hearings,   both  held   at  the\n\nDownstate   Correctional  Facility  in  Fishkill,  New  York,\n\nfollowed.  Because  the events at these hearings  are central\n\nto this appeal, we recount them in some detail.  At the first\n\nhearing, held  May 22, 1990 (\"May  hearing\"), the immigration\n\njudge advised Abrams as follows:\n\n          All   right,   Mr.   Abrams,    at   this\n          proceeding,  you  have  the  right  to be\n          represented  by an  attorney at  your own\n          expense.   If you cannot afford  a lawyer\n          or obtain a lawyer, you should have been,\n          ah, presented  with a list of  free legal\n          services, as well as your appeal rights.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  The state  indictment named the defendant  as Perry Gaul,\nan alias used by Abrams.\n\n3.  The Order to Show Cause and Notice of Hearing charged two\ngrounds for  deportation: (1) remaining in  the United States\nfor  a longer  time than  permitted following admission  as a\nnon-immigrant  in violation of what now appears at 8 U.S.C.  \n1251(a)(1)(B), and  (2)  conviction of  two crimes  involving\n\"moral turpitude  not  arising  out  of a  single  scheme  of\ncriminal   misconduct\"   in   violation   of   8   U.S.C.    \n1251(a)(2)(4)(ii).\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          At some point during  the hearing, Abrams was given\n\nthe  notice of  his appeal  rights.4   Abrams  then indicated\n\nthat  he wished  to retain  counsel.   The immigration  judge\n\ncontinued:\n\n          The list  I gave you  sir, if you  have a\n          problem getting a lawyer, you can try and\n          get someone on that list to represent you\n          and  it has your  appeal rights included,\n          just   in  case  you  have  to  represent\n          yourself.\n\n          The immigration  judge advised Abrams of the nature\n\nof  the charges  against him,  and Abrams  indicated that  he\n\nunderstood.   The  judge  then asked  Abrams  whether he  was\n\nmarried, to which Abrams answered in the affirmative.  Abrams\n\nalso told the judge  that he had  a three-year-old son.   The\n\njudge then stated:\n\n          [T]here may be some relief that you might\n          be able to apply for, but I would suggest\n          you  have your lawyer  here, or otherwise\n          we may  be  compelled to  go ahead,  even\n          though you're unrepresented.\n\n          The  hearing  was  continued until  July  10,  1990\n\n(\"July  continuance\").   Unable  to  retain  private counsel,\n\nAbrams  obtained --  on the  date of  the continuance  -- the\n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  Abrams  later  testified that  he  received  a form  that\nappeared to  be similar to INS  form I-618.  Form  I-618 is a\none-page  document explaining  procedures to  appeal from  an\nimmigration judge's decision.  The notice is captioned: \n\n               WRITTEN NOTICE OF APPEAL RIGHTS\n                      Your Appeal Rights\n                  Read This Notice Carefully\r                                                        \n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nservices of Attorney Lindsey  Collins, whose name appeared on\n\nthe free legal services list.  Abrams and Collins met for ten\n\nto fifteen minutes prior  to the hearing.  After  the hearing\n\ncommenced,  Abrams acknowledged that Collins was representing\n\nhim.   During a colloquy between Abrams and the judge, Abrams\n\nadmitted  that:   (1)  he was  a citizen  of Guyana;  (2) had\n\nentered  the country  on a  six-month tourist  visa;  (3) had\n\nremained in the United States  without permission of the  INS\n\nafter the  agency permitted him to leave voluntarily; and (4)\n\na  New York  state  court had  convicted  him on  charges  of\n\ncriminal  possession of  a  weapon and  possession of  stolen\n\nproperty.\n\n          The immigration judge then said to Abrams:\n\n          [D]o  you understand,  based on  what you\n          have told me, based on what your attorney\n          has  told  me  and  based on  the  record\n          presented,  it  appears   that  you   are\n          deportable from the United States for the\n          reasons that I have  indicated.  And, ah,\n          since you are not seeking any application\n          for relief, I would have no choice but to\n          enter   an   order  ordering   you  [sic]\n          deportation from the  United States  back\n          to Guyana.  Do you understand that sir?\n\nAbrams responded,  \"yes.\"   The immigration  judge addressing\n\nAttorney  Collins  asked, \"Mr.  Collins,  on  behalf of  your\n\nclient, are you willing to accept  such a decision as a final\n\ndecision?\"  Collins responded, \"I do, I do your  Honor.\"  The\n\ndeportation  order issued on July  10, 1990.   Abrams did not\n\nappeal the order, nor did he request an adjustment in status.\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          On  April 3,  1992,  Abrams was  deported from  the\n\nUnited States.  Subsequently,  he reentered the United States\n\nwithout permission.  On  August 31, 1993, he was  arrested by\n\nEast Providence,  Rhode Island,  police  for obstruction  and\n\nfiling a false report, crimes for which he was convicted.  \n\n          The indictment  in this case  then issued.   On the\n\nday of jury impanelment, Abrams filed a motion to dismiss the\n\nindictment  on  the  basis  that   the  original  deportation\n\nproceeding was  fundamentally unfair because he  did not know\n\nhe  had a right of appeal or alternative relief.  On February\n\n1,  1994, the district  court held an  evidentiary hearing on\n\nthe motion  at which  Abrams testified.   Abrams acknowledged\n\nthe receipt  of a form dealing  with appeal rights.   He also\n\nacknowledged that,  at the time he  had the form, he  knew it\n\ndealt with  his appeal rights.  He  testified that he had the\n\nform in his possession for several hours, but he said that he\n\nlost  it  during  his  transport from  Fishkill  back  to the\n\nClinton  Correctional  Facility  where  he  was  serving  his\n\nsentence.  He  further testified  that he made  no effort  to\n\nobtain  a  new  copy.    Abrams  also  acknowledged  that  he\n\nunderstood  what the  immigration judge  meant when  he asked\n\nwhether Abrams  accepted the  decision as final  and Attorney\n\nCollins answered that he did.  The day following the hearing,\n\nthe  district  court  determined  that  Abrams  \"was   fairly\n\napprised  of  his  right  to  appeal .  .  .  [and]  that  he\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nunderstood that he had the right to appeal.\"   On that basis,\n\nthe  district   court  denied  his  motion   to  dismiss  the\n\nindictment.  \n\n          On March 3, 1994, Abrams entered into a conditional\n\nplea agreement  with the  government, reserving his  right to\n\nappeal the district court's denial of his motion  to dismiss.\n\nEntry of plea and sentencing followed.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \n\n          In a prosecution brought under 8 U.S.C.   1326, the\n\ngovernment must  prove  that  the  defendant  was  previously\n\ndeported.   See 8 U.S.C.    1326(a)(1).  In  United States v.\r                                                                      \n\nMendoza-Lopez, 481  U.S. 828  (1987), the Supreme  Court made\r                         \n\nclear  that due  process requires  that before  a deportation\n\norder  may be used in a  subsequent criminal proceeding, that\n\norder   must   have   been   subject   to  judicial   review.\n\nSpecifically, the Court stated that \"where the  defects in an\n\nadministrative proceeding  foreclose judicial review  of that\n\nproceeding, an alternative means of obtaining judicial review\n\nmust be made available before the administrative order may be\n\nused  to establish  conclusively an  element of  the criminal\n\noffense.\"  Id. at 839.  In Mendoza-Lopez, the aliens were, in\r                                                    \n\neffect,  denied  a  direct  appeal because  they  were  given\n\ninadequate notice  of the right  to appeal.   The  government\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nasked the Court to  \"assume that the respondents' deportation\n\nhearing was fundamentally unfair.\"  Id.  \r                                                   \n\n          We  conclude Abrams's  collateral attack  must fail\n\nbecause  he  cannot  show that  there  were  \"defects  . .  .\n\nforeclos[ing] judicial review,\" that  is, there was no denial\n\nof his right  to appeal.5    Abrams's  principal argument  is\n\nthat  he  was  not  advised  of  his  right  to  appeal  and,\n\nconsequently, there could be no  \"considered and intelligent\"\n\nwaiver  that right.6  We  do not agree.   Abrams acknowledges\n\nreceiving the written notice of appeal  rights during the May\n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.  We   note  that   our  sister  circuits   have  uniformly\ninterpreted Mendoza-Lopez to require a showing that defendant\r                                     \nwas both denied his right to appeal the deportation order and\nthat he was actually  prejudiced by fundamental unfairness in\nthe  underlying  proceeding.   See,  e.g.,  United States  v.\r                                                                     \nEspinoza-Farlo, 34 F.3d 469,  471 (7th Cir. 1994) (collecting\r                          \ncases).  See also United States v. Fares, 978 F.2d 52, 57 (2d\r                                                    \nCir. 1992)  (\"If we find  no fundamental  unfairness, and  we\ntherefore  conclude that  a  fully informed  exercise of  the\nright of direct appeal would have yielded the alien no relief\nfrom  deportation,  the  deportation  order may  be  used  to\nestablish conclusively  an element  of a  criminal offense.\")\n(citing cases).  Because  Abrams fails on the first  step, we\nneed not consider prejudice.\n\n6.  To help put  this case in  perspective, we reiterate  two\nimportant  points.   First, deportation  proceedings  are not\ncriminal  actions.  United States  v. Bodre, 948  F.2d 28, 31\r                                                       \n(1st  Cir. 1991),  cert.  denied, 503  U.S.  941 (1992).    A\r                                            \ndeportation proceeding is a  purely civil action to determine\neligibility to  remain  in this  country, and  not to  punish\nunlawful entry.   INS v. Lopez-Mendoza,  468 U.S. 1032,  1038\r                                                  \n(1984).    Accordingly, many  of  the  procedural protections\nrequired in criminal proceedings simply  do not apply in this\ncontext.    See,  e.g., id.  at  1038-39.    Second, as  with\r                                       \ncriminal proceedings,  see, e.g.,  Jones v. Barnes,  463 U.S.\r                                                              \n745, 751 (1983),  there is no constitutional right  to appeal\nan adverse deportation order.  The right is purely statutory.\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nhearing and, as required  by applicable INS regulations,7 the\n\nimmigration  judge  ascertained  that  Abrams  had, in  fact,\n\nreceived the notice.8   Abrams, an English  speaker with some\n\ncollege education, further acknowledges having the notice for\n\nseveral hours before misplacing it.  \n\n          Abrams,  however, focuses  on the  tail end  of the\n\ncolloquy between  the immigration judge and  Attorney Collins\n\nduring the July continuance at  which point the judge  asked:\n\n\"[O]n behalf of your client, are you willing to accept such a\n\n[deportation order] as a final decision?\"  Collins responded:\n\n\"I do, I do your Honor.\"  Abrams contrasts that exchange with\n\nthe facts in United States v. Fares, 978 F.2d 52, 56 (2d Cir.\r                                               \n\n1992).  In Fares, the immigration judge asked the  defendant:\r                            \n\n\"And  you're accepting  orders of  deportation to  Lebanon as\n\nfinal in your  case with no appeal?\"   Id. at 57.   The Fares\r                                                                         \n\ncourt concluded that, although it was a \"close question,\" the\n\nquoted statement  alone was an insufficient  basis upon which\n\nto  conclude  that  the defendant  had  waived  his  right to\n\nappeal.  Id.  at 56-57.   Importantly however, unlike  Fares,\r                        \n\nAbrams received written notice of the right to appeal.   \n\n                    \r                                \n\n7.  8 C.F.R.   242.16 requires, in part, that the immigration\njudge \"shall . .  . advise respondent of the  availability of\nfree legal services . . . [and] ascertain that the respondent\nhas received a list of  such programs, and a copy of  Form I-\n618, Written Notice of Appeal Rights.\"\n\n8.  In  fact, at the May hearing, the immigration judge twice\nmentioned that the appeal form contained his \"appeal rights.\"\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          Several other facts  undermine Abrams's  contention\n\nthat he had no notice of his  right to appeal.  First, at the\n\nMay  hearing,  the  immigration  judge  specifically  advised\n\nAbrams that \"there may be some relief that you might  be able\n\nto  apply for.\"  Second,  at the July  continuance, the judge\n\nstated that since Abrams was \"not seeking any application for\n\nrelief,\" the only  option was to issue the deportation order.\n\nThird,  as Abrams  later testified,  he fully  understood the\n\nimplication  of Collins's response  regarding the finality of\n\nthe decision.   Thus, in  addition to the  written notice  of\n\nappeal, the immigration  judge made at least three  direct or\n\nindirect references  to the  right to appeal  the deportation\n\norder or to seek alternative relief.9  \n\n          Abrams waived his  rights when he failed  to file a\n\ntimely appeal.  On the basis of the record, we  conclude that\n\nAbrams made  his waiver after receiving  sufficient notice of\n\nhis rights.    Accordingly, we  conclude  that there  was  no\n\ndenial of Abrams's  rights and, consequently,  his collateral\n\nattack on the July 10, 1990, deportation order fails.10\n\n                    \r                                \n\n9.  We also note  that having sought an adjustment  in status\nin 1986, Abrams had some familiarity with INS procedures.\n\n10.  Abrams also  argues  that he  was not  notified that  he\ncould contact the Guyanese consulate as required by 8  C.F.R.\n  242.2(g) (\"Every detained  alien shall be notified that  he\nmay communicate  with the consular or  diplomatic officers of\nthe country of his nationality in the United States.\").  This\nis  an issue properly addressed on direct appeal.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \nWaldron v.

Sec.  1326(b)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Abrams, a citizen of Guyana, entered the United States in February 1981 on a six-month tourist visa.  After the visa expired, he remained in the United States and, over the next five years, was convicted of several crimes, including robbery.  During this period, Abrams, who speaks and reads English, briefly attended college.  In 1986, Abrams filed for an adjustment of status seeking to become a lawful permanent resident.  By decision dated January 7, 1987, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) denied Abrams's petition, but permitted him to leave the country voluntarily, thus avoiding deportation proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding this concession, Abrams chose not to leave.  In July 1987, Abrams and Andrea Gardner, whom he never married, had a son who is a United States citizen.  In October 1988, a New York state court convicted Abrams<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> for criminal possession of a weapon, criminal possession of stolen property, and bail jumping.  In October 1989, while incarcerated in New York state prison, Abrams married Angela Morgan, a United States citizen, with whom he had been living prior to the 1988 conviction.  On March 13, 1990, while Abrams was still in prison, the INS instituted deportation proceedings against him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two deportation hearings, both held at the Downstate Correctional Facility in Fishkill, New York, followed.  Because the events at these hearings are central to this appeal, we recount them in some detail.  At the first hearing, held May 22, 1990 (\"May hearing\"), the immigration judge advised Abrams as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>All right, Mr. Abrams, at this proceeding, you have the right to be represented by an attorney at your own expense.  If you cannot afford a lawyer or obtain a lawyer, you should have been, ah, presented with a list of free legal services, as well as your appeal rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point during the hearing, Abrams was given the notice of his appeal rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Abrams then indicated that he wished to retain counsel.  The immigration judge continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>The list I gave you sir, if you have a problem getting a lawyer, you can try and get someone on that list to represent you and it has your appeal rights included, just in case you have to represent yourself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The immigration judge advised Abrams of the nature of the charges against him, and Abrams indicated that he understood.  The judge then asked Abrams whether he was married, to which Abrams answered in the affirmative.  Abrams also told the judge that he had a three-year-old son.  The judge then stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>[T]here may be some relief that you might be able to apply for, but I would suggest you have your lawyer here, or otherwise we may be compelled to go ahead, even though you're unrepresented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hearing was continued until July 10, 1990 (\"July continuance\").  Unable to retain private counsel, Abrams obtained-on the date of the continuance-the services of Attorney Lindsey Collins, whose name appeared on the free legal services list.  Abrams and Collins met for ten to fifteen minutes prior to the hearing.  After the hearing commenced, Abrams acknowledged that Collins was representing him.  During a colloquy between Abrams and the judge, Abrams admitted that:  (1) he was a citizen of Guyana;  (2) had entered the country on a six-month tourist visa;  (3) had remained in the United States without permission of the INS after the agency permitted him to leave voluntarily;  and (4) a New York state court had convicted him on charges of criminal possession of a weapon and possession of stolen property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The immigration judge then said to Abrams:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>[D]o you understand, based on what you have told me, based on what your attorney has told me and based on the record presented, it appears that you are deportable from the United States for the reasons that I have indicated.  And, ah, since you are not seeking any application for relief, I would have no choice but to enter an order ordering you [sic] deportation from the United States back to Guyana.  Do you understand that sir?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Abrams responded, \"yes.\"  The immigration judge addressing Attorney Collins asked, \"Mr. Collins, on behalf of your client, are you willing to accept such a decision as a final decision?\"  Collins responded, \"I do, I do your Honor.\"  The deportation order issued on July 10, 1990.  Abrams did not appeal the order, nor did he request an adjustment in status.  On April 3, 1992, Abrams was deported from the United States.  Subsequently, he reentered the United States without permission.  On August 31, 1993, he was arrested by East Providence, Rhode Island, police for obstruction and filing a false report, crimes for which he was convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment in this case then issued.  On the day of jury impanelment, Abrams filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the basis that the original deportation proceeding was fundamentally unfair because he did not know he had a right of appeal or alternative relief.  On February 1, 1994, the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion at which Abrams testified.  Abrams acknowledged the receipt of a form dealing with appeal rights.  He also acknowledged that, at the time he had the form, he knew it dealt with his appeal rights.  He testified that he had the form in his possession for several hours, but he said that he lost it during his transport from Fishkill back to the Clinton Correctional Facility where he was serving his sentence.  He further testified that he made no effort to obtain a new copy.  Abrams also acknowledged that he understood what the immigration judge meant when he asked whether Abrams accepted the decision as final and Attorney Collins answered that he did.  The day following the hearing, the district court determined that Abrams \"was fairly apprised of his right to appeal ... [and] that he understood that he had the right to appeal.\"  On that basis, the district court denied his motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 3, 1994, Abrams entered into a conditional plea agreement with the government, reserving his right to appeal the district court's denial of his motion to dismiss.  Entry of plea and sentencing followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a prosecution brought under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326, the government must prove that the defendant was previously deported.  See 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(a)(1).  In United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S. 828 (1987), the Supreme Court made clear that due process requires that before a deportation order may be used in a subsequent criminal proceeding, that order must have been subject to judicial review.  Specifically, the Court stated that \"where the defects in an administrative proceeding foreclose judicial review of that proceeding, an alternative means of obtaining judicial review must be made available before the administrative order may be used to establish conclusively an element of the criminal offense.\"  Id. at 839.  In Mendoza-Lopez, the aliens were, in effect, denied a direct appeal because they were given inadequate notice of the right to appeal.  The government asked the Court to \"assume that the respondents' deportation hearing was fundamentally unfair.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude Abrams's collateral attack must fail because he cannot show that there were \"defects ... foreclos[ing] judicial review,\" that is, there was no denial of his right to appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Abrams's principal argument is that he was not advised of his right to appeal and, consequently, there could be no \"considered and intelligent\" waiver that right.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  We do not agree.  Abrams acknowledges receiving the written notice of appeal rights during the May hearing and, as required by applicable INS regulations,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> the immigration judge ascertained that Abrams had, in fact, received the notice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Abrams, an English speaker with some college education, further acknowledges having the notice for several hours before misplacing it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Abrams, however, focuses on the tail end of the colloquy between the immigration judge and Attorney Collins during the July continuance at which point the judge asked:  \"[O]n behalf of your client, are you willing to accept such a [deportation order] as a final decision?\"  Collins responded:  \"I do, I do your Honor.\"  Abrams contrasts that exchange with the facts in United States v. Fares, 978 F.2d 52, 56 (2d Cir. 1992).  In Fares, the immigration judge asked the defendant:  \"And you're accepting orders of deportation to Lebanon as final in your case with no appeal?\"  Id. at 57.  The Fares court concluded that, although it was a \"close question,\" the quoted statement alone was an insufficient basis upon which to conclude that the defendant had waived his right to appeal.  Id. at 56-57.  Importantly however, unlike Fares, Abrams received written notice of the right to appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several other facts undermine Abrams's contention that he had no notice of his right to appeal.  First, at the May hearing, the immigration judge specifically advised Abrams that \"there may be some relief that you might be able to apply for.\"  Second, at the July continuance, the judge stated that since Abrams was \"not seeking any application for relief,\" the only option was to issue the deportation order.  Third, as Abrams later testified, he fully understood the implication of Collins's response regarding the finality of the decision.  Thus, in addition to the written notice of appeal, the immigration judge made at least three direct or indirect references to the right to appeal the deportation order or to seek alternative relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Abrams waived his rights when he failed to file a timely appeal.  On the basis of the record, we conclude that Abrams made his waiver after receiving sufficient notice of his rights.  Accordingly, we conclude that there was no denial of Abrams's rights and, consequently, his collateral attack on the July 10, 1990, deportation order fails.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In pertinent part, Sec. 1326 provides that any alien who has been arrested and deported and later reenters the United States without the Attorney General's consent shall be fined or imprisoned, or both.  8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(a).  An alien whose deportation \"was subsequent to a conviction for commission of three or more misdemeanors involving drugs, crimes against the person, or both, or a felony (other than an aggravated felony),\" shall be fined or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.  8 U.S.C.

Sec. 1251(a)(1)(B), and (2) conviction of two crimes involving \"moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct\" in violation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1251(a)(2)(4)(ii)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Abrams later testified that he received a form that appeared to be similar to INS form I-618.  Form I-618 is a one- page document explaining procedures to appeal from an immigration judge's decision.  The notice is captioned:</p>\n        <p>WRITTEN NOTICE OF APPEAL RIGHTS</p>\n        <p>Your Appeal Rights</p>\n        <p>Read This Notice Carefully</p>\n        <p>(emphasis in original).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We note that our sister circuits have uniformly interpreted Mendoza-Lopez to require a showing that defendant was both denied his right to appeal the deportation order and that he was actually prejudiced by fundamental unfairness in the underlying proceeding.  See, e.g., United States v. Espinoza- Farlo, 34 F.3d 469, 471 (7th Cir. 1994) (collecting cases).  See also United States v. Fares, 978 F.2d 52, 57 (2d Cir. 1992) (\"If we find no fundamental unfairness, and we therefore conclude that a fully informed exercise of the right of direct appeal would have yielded the alien no relief from deportation, the deportation order may be used to establish conclusively an element of a criminal offense.\")  (citing cases).  Because Abrams fails on the first step, we need not consider prejudice</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> To help put this case in perspective, we reiterate two important points.  First, deportation proceedings are not criminal actions.  United States v. Bodre, 948 F.2d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 941 (1992).  A deportation proceeding is a purely civil action to determine eligibility to remain in this country, and not to punish unlawful entry.  INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1038 (1984).  Accordingly, many of the procedural protections required in criminal proceedings simply do not apply in this context.  See, e.g., id. at 1038-39.  Second, as with criminal proceedings, see, e.g., Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 751 (1983), there is no constitutional right to appeal an adverse deportation order.

Sec.  1326(b)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Abrams, a citizen of Guyana, entered the United States in February 1981 on a six-month tourist visa.  After the visa expired, he remained in the United States and, over the next five years, was convicted of several crimes, including robbery.  During this period, Abrams, who speaks and reads English, briefly attended college.  In 1986, Abrams filed for an adjustment of status seeking to become a lawful permanent resident.  By decision dated January 7, 1987, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) denied Abrams's petition, but permitted him to leave the country voluntarily, thus avoiding deportation proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding this concession, Abrams chose not to leave.  In July 1987, Abrams and Andrea Gardner, whom he never married, had a son who is a United States citizen.  In October 1988, a New York state court convicted Abrams<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> for criminal possession of a weapon, criminal possession of stolen property, and bail jumping.  In October 1989, while incarcerated in New York state prison, Abrams married Angela Morgan, a United States citizen, with whom he had been living prior to the 1988 conviction.  On March 13, 1990, while Abrams was still in prison, the INS instituted deportation proceedings against him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two deportation hearings, both held at the Downstate Correctional Facility in Fishkill, New York, followed.  Because the events at these hearings are central to this appeal, we recount them in some detail.  At the first hearing, held May 22, 1990 (\"May hearing\"), the immigration judge advised Abrams as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>All right, Mr. Abrams, at this proceeding, you have the right to be represented by an attorney at your own expense.  If you cannot afford a lawyer or obtain a lawyer, you should have been, ah, presented with a list of free legal services, as well as your appeal rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point during the hearing, Abrams was given the notice of his appeal rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Abrams then indicated that he wished to retain counsel.  The immigration judge continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>The list I gave you sir, if you have a problem getting a lawyer, you can try and get someone on that list to represent you and it has your appeal rights included, just in case you have to represent yourself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The immigration judge advised Abrams of the nature of the charges against him, and Abrams indicated that he understood.  The judge then asked Abrams whether he was married, to which Abrams answered in the affirmative.  Abrams also told the judge that he had a three-year-old son.  The judge then stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>[T]here may be some relief that you might be able to apply for, but I would suggest you have your lawyer here, or otherwise we may be compelled to go ahead, even though you're unrepresented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hearing was continued until July 10, 1990 (\"July continuance\").  Unable to retain private counsel, Abrams obtained-on the date of the continuance-the services of Attorney Lindsey Collins, whose name appeared on the free legal services list.  Abrams and Collins met for ten to fifteen minutes prior to the hearing.  After the hearing commenced, Abrams acknowledged that Collins was representing him.  During a colloquy between Abrams and the judge, Abrams admitted that:  (1) he was a citizen of Guyana;  (2) had entered the country on a six-month tourist visa;  (3) had remained in the United States without permission of the INS after the agency permitted him to leave voluntarily;  and (4) a New York state court had convicted him on charges of criminal possession of a weapon and possession of stolen property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The immigration judge then said to Abrams:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>[D]o you understand, based on what you have told me, based on what your attorney has told me and based on the record presented, it appears that you are deportable from the United States for the reasons that I have indicated.  And, ah, since you are not seeking any application for relief, I would have no choice but to enter an order ordering you [sic] deportation from the United States back to Guyana.  Do you understand that sir?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Abrams responded, \"yes.\"  The immigration judge addressing Attorney Collins asked, \"Mr. Collins, on behalf of your client, are you willing to accept such a decision as a final decision?\"  Collins responded, \"I do, I do your Honor.\"  The deportation order issued on July 10, 1990.  Abrams did not appeal the order, nor did he request an adjustment in status.  On April 3, 1992, Abrams was deported from the United States.  Subsequently, he reentered the United States without permission.  On August 31, 1993, he was arrested by East Providence, Rhode Island, police for obstruction and filing a false report, crimes for which he was convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment in this case then issued.  On the day of jury impanelment, Abrams filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the basis that the original deportation proceeding was fundamentally unfair because he did not know he had a right of appeal or alternative relief.  On February 1, 1994, the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion at which Abrams testified.  Abrams acknowledged the receipt of a form dealing with appeal rights.  He also acknowledged that, at the time he had the form, he knew it dealt with his appeal rights.  He testified that he had the form in his possession for several hours, but he said that he lost it during his transport from Fishkill back to the Clinton Correctional Facility where he was serving his sentence.  He further testified that he made no effort to obtain a new copy.  Abrams also acknowledged that he understood what the immigration judge meant when he asked whether Abrams accepted the decision as final and Attorney Collins answered that he did.  The day following the hearing, the district court determined that Abrams \"was fairly apprised of his right to appeal ... [and] that he understood that he had the right to appeal.\"  On that basis, the district court denied his motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 3, 1994, Abrams entered into a conditional plea agreement with the government, reserving his right to appeal the district court's denial of his motion to dismiss.  Entry of plea and sentencing followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a prosecution brought under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326, the government must prove that the defendant was previously deported.  See 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(a)(1).  In United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111894\"><a href=\"/opinion/111894/united-states-v-mendoza-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span> </a></span>(1987), the Supreme Court made clear that due process requires that before a deportation order may be used in a subsequent criminal proceeding, that order must have been subject to judicial review.  Specifically, the Court stated that \"where the defects in an administrative proceeding foreclose judicial review of that proceeding, an alternative means of obtaining judicial review must be made available before the administrative order may be used to establish conclusively an element of the criminal offense.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111894\"><a href=\"/opinion/111894/united-states-v-mendoza-lopez/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 839. </a></span> In Mendoza-Lopez, the aliens were, in effect, denied a direct appeal because they were given inadequate notice of the right to appeal.  The government asked the Court to \"assume that the respondents' deportation hearing was fundamentally unfair.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude Abrams's collateral attack must fail because he cannot show that there were \"defects ... foreclos[ing] judicial review,\" that is, there was no denial of his right to appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Abrams's principal argument is that he was not advised of his right to appeal and, consequently, there could be no \"considered and intelligent\" waiver that right.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  We do not agree.  Abrams acknowledges receiving the written notice of appeal rights during the May hearing and, as required by applicable INS regulations,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> the immigration judge ascertained that Abrams had, in fact, received the notice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Abrams, an English speaker with some college education, further acknowledges having the notice for several hours before misplacing it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Abrams, however, focuses on the tail end of the colloquy between the immigration judge and Attorney Collins during the July continuance at which point the judge asked:  \"[O]n behalf of your client, are you willing to accept such a [deportation order] as a final decision?\"  Collins responded:  \"I do, I do your Honor.\"  Abrams contrasts that exchange with the facts in United States v. Fares, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593298\"><a href=\"/opinion/593298/united-states-v-yassem-fares-also-known-as-yasser-fares/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 56 (2d Cir. 1992).  In Fares, the immigration judge asked the defendant:  \"And you're accepting orders of deportation to Lebanon as final in your case with no appeal?\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593298\"><a href=\"/opinion/593298/united-states-v-yassem-fares-also-known-as-yasser-fares/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 57. </a></span> The Fares court concluded that, although it was a \"close question,\" the quoted statement alone was an insufficient basis upon which to conclude that the defendant had waived his right to appeal.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593298\"><a href=\"/opinion/593298/united-states-v-yassem-fares-also-known-as-yasser-fares/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 56-57. </a></span> Importantly however, unlike Fares, Abrams received written notice of the right to appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several other facts undermine Abrams's contention that he had no notice of his right to appeal.  First, at the May hearing, the immigration judge specifically advised Abrams that \"there may be some relief that you might be able to apply for.\"  Second, at the July continuance, the judge stated that since Abrams was \"not seeking any application for relief,\" the only option was to issue the deportation order.  Third, as Abrams later testified, he fully understood the implication of Collins's response regarding the finality of the decision.  Thus, in addition to the written notice of appeal, the immigration judge made at least three direct or indirect references to the right to appeal the deportation order or to seek alternative relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Abrams waived his rights when he failed to file a timely appeal.  On the basis of the record, we conclude that Abrams made his waiver after receiving sufficient notice of his rights.  Accordingly, we conclude that there was no denial of Abrams's rights and, consequently, his collateral attack on the July 10, 1990, deportation order fails.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In pertinent part, Sec. 1326 provides that any alien who has been arrested and deported and later reenters the United States without the Attorney General's consent shall be fined or imprisoned, or both.  8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(a).  An alien whose deportation \"was subsequent to a conviction for commission of three or more misdemeanors involving drugs, crimes against the person, or both, or a felony (other than an aggravated felony),\" shall be fined or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.  8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(1)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The state indictment named the defendant as Perry Gaul, an alias used by Abrams</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Order to Show Cause and Notice of Hearing charged two grounds for deportation:  (1) remaining in the United States for a longer time than permitted following admission as a non- immigrant in violation of what now appears at 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1251(a)(1)(B), and (2) conviction of two crimes involving \"moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct\" in violation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1251(a)(2)(4)(ii)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Abrams later testified that he received a form that appeared to be similar to INS form I-618.  Form I-618 is a one- page document explaining procedures to appeal from an immigration judge's decision.  The notice is captioned:</p>\n        <p>WRITTEN NOTICE OF APPEAL RIGHTS</p>\n        <p>Your Appeal Rights</p>\n        <p>Read This Notice Carefully</p>\n        <p>(emphasis in original).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We note that our sister circuits have uniformly interpreted Mendoza-Lopez to require a showing that defendant was both denied his right to appeal the deportation order and that he was actually prejudiced by fundamental unfairness in the underlying proceeding.  See, e.g., United States v. Espinoza- Farlo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677376\"><a href=\"/opinion/677376/united-states-v-agripino-espinoza-farlo/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span>, 471 (7th Cir. 1994) (collecting cases).  See also United States v. Fares, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593298\"><a href=\"/opinion/593298/united-states-v-yassem-fares-also-known-as-yasser-fares/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 57 (2d Cir. 1992) (\"If we find no fundamental unfairness, and we therefore conclude that a fully informed exercise of the right of direct appeal would have yielded the alien no relief from deportation, the deportation order may be used to establish conclusively an element of a criminal offense.\")  (citing cases).  Because Abrams fails on the first step, we need not consider prejudice</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> To help put this case in perspective, we reiterate two important points.  First, deportation proceedings are not criminal actions.  United States v. Bodre, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571254\"><a href=\"/opinion/571254/united-states-v-ingrid-josefina-bodre/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">941</span> </span>(1992).  A deportation proceeding is a purely civil action to determine eligibility to remain in this country, and not to punish unlawful entry.  INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111265\"><a href=\"/opinion/111265/ins-v-lopez-mendoza/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1032</span></a></span>, 1038 (1984).  Accordingly, many of the procedural protections required in criminal proceedings simply do not apply in this context.  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111265\"><a href=\"/opinion/111265/ins-v-lopez-mendoza/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1038-39. </a></span> Second, as with criminal proceedings, see, e.g., Jones v. Barnes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111012\"><a href=\"/opinion/111012/jones-v-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></a></span>, 751 (1983), there is no constitutional right to appeal an adverse deportation order.  The right is purely statutory</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> 8 C.F.R. Sec. 242.16 requires, in part, that the immigration judge \"shall ... advise respondent of the availability of free legal services ... [and] ascertain that the respondent has received a list of such programs, and a copy of Form I-618, Written Notice of Appeal Rights.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In fact, at the May hearing, the immigration judge twice mentioned that the appeal form contained his \"appeal rights.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We also note that having sought an adjustment in status in 1986, Abrams had some familiarity with INS procedures</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Abrams also argues that he was not notified that he could contact the Guyanese consulate as required by 8 C.F.R. Sec. 242.2(g) (\"Every detained alien shall be notified that he may communicate with the consular or diplomatic officers of the country of his nationality in the United States.\").  This is an issue properly addressed on direct appeal.  See, e.g., Waldron v. INS, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></span>, 515 (2d Cir. 1993), cert. denied <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span> </span>(1994).  Since we hold that there was no denial of a direct appeal, Abrams waived consideration of this issue</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
