Milagros  Sosa  (claimant)  appeals from  a\r                            \n\ndistrict  court  judgment  affirming  the  decision  of  the\n\nSecretary  of   Health  and  Human  Services   to  deny  her\n\napplication  for  disability  benefits.    For  the  reasons\n\noutlined below  (and enumerated  at  greater length  in  the\n\nmagistrate-judge's report), we  find substantial evidence in\n\nsupport of the Secretary's decision and therefore affirm. \n\n  Claimant is a married, 38-year-old  mother of two who  was\n\nemployed as  a bank  teller and  loan  clerk until  December\n\n1987.   She alleges that  she has  been disabled since  that\n\ndate due to  the following series of ailments:  (1) vascular\n\ninsufficiency and thrombophlebitis of the legs;  (2) painful\n\nfibromyositis and arthritis  of the back;  (3) vertigo;  and\n\n(4)  nervous   depression.     Following   a  hearing,   the\n\nadministrative  law judge  (ALJ) found  that  claimant's leg\n\ncondition,  while  restricting  her  ability  to  stand  for\n\nextended  periods and thus  precluding a return  to her past\n\njob, did not prevent her from performing sedentary work.  In\n\nturn, the ALJ determined that claimant's  remaining ailments\n\nimposed only minimal functional restrictions, such that  her\n\nability to perform  the full range of sedentary work was not\n\nsignificantly  compromised.    Applying Rule  201.29  of the\n\nGrid,  see 20 C.F.R.  Part 404, Subpart  P, App. 2,  the ALJ\r                         \n\nreached a finding of not disabled.  Claimant now argues that\n\nsuch findings were unsupported by  substantial evidence and,\r\r\n\nmore  specifically, that  it was  error not  to hear  from a\n\nvocational expert.  We disagree.\n\n  Abundant record evidence supports  the conclusion that the\n\nexertional  restrictions imposed by claimant's leg condition\n\ndid not  preclude performance of sedentary  work.1  Claimant\n\nhas had two episodes of thrombophlebitis2: in February  1987\n\n(three  weeks after the birth of  her first child) and again\n\nin  September 1988 (in  the midst of  her second pregnancy).\n\nBoth  episodes were  successfully treated  over a  period of\n\ndays.    Otherwise, she  has  suffered  from chronic  venous\n\ninsufficiency with  recurrent  edema3 and  pain  (consistent\n\nwith  a post-phlebitic  syndrome)--for which  medication and\n\nthe  use  of  elastic  socks  have  been  prescribed.    The\n\nphysician who treated claimant between January and July 1988\n\n(Dr. Munoz) specifically  reported that she  was capable  of\n\nsedentary  activity,   identifying   her   only   functional\n\nlimitation  as an inability  to stand  or walk  for extended\n\nperiods.  Much of the other evidence was to the same effect.\n\nFor example, a  neurologist (Dr. Scarano  Garcia) in  August\n\n1988 described claimant's  ability to walk on heels  or toes\n\n                 \r                                \n\n1.  Sedentary work  involves lifting no more  than ten pounds\nat a time and \"occasional\" walking and standing.  20 C.F.R.  \n404.1567(a).\n\n2.  Thrombophlebitis is the inflammation of a vein associated\nwith blood clot formation.\n\n3.  Venous insufficiency involves  the inadequate drainage of\nvenous blood.   Edema is the accumulation of  excessive fluid\nin cells or tissues.\n\n                          -3-\r\r\n\nas  being  within normal  limits.   In December  1988, three\n\nmonths after  claimant's second bout of  thrombophlebitis, a\n\nnon-examining  physician (Dr.  Arzola) completed  a residual\n\nfunctional capacity assessment noting only minor limitations\n\nin this  regard.  And  in October  1989, a vascular  surgeon\n\n(Dr. Ramirez Ferrer) found some swelling in claimant's  legs\n\nbut  no other  complications.  Notwithstanding  the contrary\n\nindications  in the  record,4 such  evidence  provides ample\n\nsupport for the ALJ's conclusion.\n\n  In turn, we  think the ALJ was  warranted in finding  that\n\nthe functional restrictions imposed by  claimant's remaining\n\nailments  were minimal.  As to  her complaints of back pain,\n\nthe  ALJ  found  that  claimant  suffered  from  impairments\n\ncapable of producing  pain, but then  proceeded to  discount\n\nthe  severity of those complaints.   The record reveals that\n\nclaimant experienced a  back sprain in  1982, for which  she\n\nreceived  physical therapy  and was  awarded a  five percent\n\nstate disability.   More recently, claimant  was treated for\n\npain in the right shoulder in February 1988.  Raising of the\n\narm was found to cause suppression of the subclavian artery,\n\nbut  neurological testing was otherwise normal; the treating\n\n                 \r                                \n\n4.  Most  notable  among  these  was the  evaluation  of  one\ntreating physician (Dr. Quinones  Soto), who in December 1987\nrecommended  bed rest  for  six months  and,  in April  1988,\nreported  that claimant  was  totally disabled.   He  stopped\ntreating claimant  in December  1987, however, giving  way to\nDr.  Munoz.  As mentioned, the latter described a more benign\ncondition.  \n\n                          -4-\r\r\n\nphysical  therapist (Dr.  Oms)  reported  an  impression  of\n\nfibromyositis.   Similarly,  in August  1988, a  neurologist\n\n(Dr. Rodriguez Del  Valle) diagnosed a  painful syndrome  in\n\nthe cervical and dorsal region, of unknown origin, when  the\n\nright  arm  was  raised.    Nonetheless,   muscle  strength,\n\nreflexes  and sensibility  were  all within  normal  limits.\n\nThat  same month,  another neurologist (Dr.  Scarano Garcia)\n\nreported normal range  of motion in  the cervical,  thoracic\n\nand  lumbar regions,  along with  normal muscle tone  in all\n\nextremities.   On  the basis  of such  evidence, and  on the\n\nbasis of  his questioning  of  claimant in  accordance  with\n\nAvery v. Secretary of HHS, 797 F.2d 19 (1st Cir. 1986),  the\r                                        \n\nALJ  justifiably  concluded  that  most  of  her  pain   was\n\neffectively  controlled through therapy and medication.  And\n\nany residual  limitation on claimant's ability  to raise her\n\nright arm  over her head  would have  little bearing on  her\n\ncapacity to perform sedentary work.\n\n  Claimant first complained of vertigo in July 1988,  during\n\nthe  middle  of her  second  pregnancy.   Following  a brief\n\nhospitalization  therefor (as well  as for pregnancy-related\n\nvomiting),  she  was  treated  over  the  next  month  by  a\n\nneurologist  (Dr.  Scarano  Garcia).   Results  of extensive\n\nneurological  testing, including  a brain  scan and  an EEG,\n\nwere  normal except  for a  mild head  tremor; no  cause was\n\nfound  for her vertigo.  More  important, there is no record\n\nof any further treatment for this condition  after August 9,\n\n                          -5-\r\r\n\n1988.  Indeed, there is no evidence that claimant thereafter\n\nmade any  further  complaints  in  this  regard  to  medical\n\npersonnel--apart from  allegations voiced to  a psychiatrist\n\nin January 1990.   The ALJ thus  was warranted in  regarding\n\nclaimant's vertigo as a short-lived affliction. \n\n  Finally,   substantial   evidence   supports   the   ALJ's\n\nconclusion that claimant's  mental condition was  of minimal\n\nseverity.  Claimant alleges that she has suffered  therefrom\n\nsince the age  of thirteen.  Yet she received no psychiatric\n\ntreatment from at least 1980 onwards, and made no mention of\n\nsuch  a condition  to  any of  her treating  physicians.   A\n\npsychiatrist (Dr.  Toro)  who examined  claimant in  January\n\n1989,  shortly  before  she  delivered  her  second   child,\n\ndiagnosed only a  \"mild\" generalized anxiety  disorder.   In\n\nparticular,  he reported  that claimant  cared for  her son,\n\nperformed some  housework with the help  of others, attended\n\nto  her  own personal  needs  without  supervision, and  was\n\ncapable  of  normal  interpersonal  relationships.   It  was\n\nwithin the  ALJ's prerogative to credit  Dr. Toro's findings\n\nover those reached  one year later by a  second psychiatrist\n\n(Dr.  Bocanegra).  And even the  latter, we note, recorded a\n\ndiagnosis of only \"moderate\" dysthymia.  \n\n  We therefore find substantial  evidentiary support for the\n\nALJ's  conclusions.    We  likewise  conclude  that  it  was\n\nunnecessary to hear vocational evidence.  As explained,  the\n\nALJ  was warranted in  finding that claimant's nonexertional\n\n                          -6-\r\r\n\nimpairments  had  only a  minimal impact  on her  ability to\n\nperform  the  full range  of  sedentary  work.   Under  such\n\ncircumstances, reliance on the Grid to yield a finding as to\n\ndisability  was  appropriate.     See,  e.g.,  Heggarty   v.\r                                                                      \n\nSullivan, 947 F.2d 990, 995-96 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam);\r                       \n\nOrtiz v.

For the reasons outlined below (and enumerated at greater length in the magistrate-judge's report), we find substantial evidence in support of the Secretary's decision and therefore affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant is a married, 38-year-old mother of two who was employed as a bank teller and loan clerk until December 1987.  She alleges that she has been disabled since that date due to the following series of ailments:  (1) vascular insufficiency and thrombophlebitis of the legs;  (2) painful fibromyositis and arthritis of the back;  (3) vertigo;  and (4) nervous depression.  Following a hearing, the administrative law judge (ALJ) found that claimant's leg condition, while restricting her ability to stand for extended periods and thus precluding a return to her past job, did not prevent her from performing sedentary work.  In turn, the ALJ determined that claimant's remaining ailments imposed only minimal functional restrictions, such that her ability to perform the full range of sedentary work was not significantly compromised.  Applying Rule 201.29 of the Grid, see 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, App. 2, the ALJ reached a finding of not disabled.  Claimant now argues that such findings were unsupported by substantial evidence and, more specifically, that it was error not to hear from a vocational expert.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Abundant record evidence supports the conclusion that the exertional restrictions imposed by claimant's leg condition did not preclude performance of sedentary work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Claimant has had two episodes of thrombophlebitis<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>:  in February 1987 (three weeks after the birth of her first child) and again in September 1988 (in the midst of her second pregnancy).  Both episodes were successfully treated over a period of days.  Otherwise, she has suffered from chronic venous insufficiency with recurrent edema<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and pain (consistent with a post- phlebitic syndrome)-for which medication and the use of elastic socks have been prescribed.  The physician who treated claimant between January and July 1988 (Dr. Munoz) specifically reported that she was capable of sedentary activity, identifying her only functional limitation as an inability to stand or walk for extended periods.  Much of the other evidence was to the same effect.  For example, a neurologist (Dr. Scarano Garcia) in August 1988 described claimant's ability to walk on heels or toes as being within normal limits.  In December 1988, three months after claimant's second bout of thrombophlebitis, a non-examining physician (Dr. Arzola) completed a residual functional capacity assessment noting only minor limitations in this regard.  And in October 1989, a vascular surgeon (Dr. Ramirez Ferrer) found some swelling in claimant's legs but no other complications.  Notwithstanding the contrary indications in the record,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> such evidence provides ample support for the ALJ's conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In turn, we think the ALJ was warranted in finding that the functional restrictions imposed by claimant's remaining ailments were minimal.  As to her complaints of back pain, the ALJ found that claimant suffered from impairments capable of producing pain, but then proceeded to discount the severity of those complaints.  The record reveals that claimant experienced a back sprain in 1982, for which she received physical therapy and was awarded a five percent state disability.  More recently, claimant was treated for pain in the right shoulder in February 1988.  Raising of the arm was found to cause suppression of the subclavian artery, but neurological testing was otherwise normal;  the treating physical therapist (Dr. Oms) reported an impression of fibromyositis.  Similarly, in August 1988, a neurologist (Dr. Rodriguez Del Valle) diagnosed a painful syndrome in the cervical and dorsal region, of unknown origin, when the right arm was raised.  Nonetheless, muscle strength, reflexes and sensibility were all within normal limits.  That same month, another neurologist (Dr. Scarano Garcia) reported normal range of motion in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions, along with normal muscle tone in all extremities.  On the basis of such evidence, and on the basis of his questioning of claimant in accordance with Avery v. Secretary of HHS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474185\"><a href=\"/opinion/474185/14-socsecrepser-301-unemplinsrep-cch-16883-ernest-s-avery-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1986), the ALJ justifiably concluded that most of her pain was effectively controlled through therapy and medication.  And any residual limitation on claimant's ability to raise her right arm over her head would have little bearing on her capacity to perform sedentary work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant first complained of vertigo in July 1988, during the middle of her second pregnancy.  Following a brief hospitalization therefor (as well as for pregnancy-related vomiting), she was treated over the next month by a neurologist (Dr. Scarano Garcia).  Results of extensive neurological testing, including a brain scan and an EEG, were normal except for a mild head tremor;  no cause was found for her vertigo.  More important, there is no record of any further treatment for this condition after August 9, 1988.  Indeed, there is no evidence that claimant thereafter made any further complaints in this regard to medical personnel-apart from allegations voiced to a psychiatrist in January 1990.  The ALJ thus was warranted in regarding claimant's vertigo as a short-lived affliction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the ALJ's conclusion that claimant's mental condition was of minimal severity.  Claimant alleges that she has suffered therefrom since the age of thirteen.  Yet she received no psychiatric treatment from at least 1980 onwards, and made no mention of such a condition to any of her treating physicians.  A psychiatrist (Dr. Toro) who examined claimant in January 1989, shortly before she delivered her second child, diagnosed only a \"mild\" generalized anxiety disorder.  In particular, he reported that claimant cared for her son, performed some housework with the help of others, attended to her own personal needs without supervision, and was capable of normal interpersonal relationships.  It was within the ALJ's prerogative to credit Dr. Toro's findings over those reached one year later by a second psychiatrist (Dr. Bocanegra).  And even the latter, we note, recorded a diagnosis of only \"moderate\" dysthymia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore find substantial evidentiary support for the ALJ's conclusions.  We likewise conclude that it was unnecessary to hear vocational evidence.  As explained, the ALJ was warranted in finding that claimant's nonexertional impairments had only a minimal impact on her ability to perform the full range of sedentary work.  Under such circumstances, reliance on the Grid to yield a finding as to disability was appropriate.  See, e.g., Heggarty v.
