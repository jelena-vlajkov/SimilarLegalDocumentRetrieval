The  Alzanki family  prevented Gedara\r\n\nfrom  leaving  their residence,  by  retaining  her passport  and\r\n\nwarning  her that  she would  be subject  to arrest  and physical\r\n\nabuse by the Kuwaiti  police should she venture outside.   Gedara\r\n\nwas informed that she soon would  be sent to the United States to\r\n\nwork  for appellant  Talal  Alzanki and  his  wife, Abair,  at  a\r\n\nmonthly  salary of  $250, which  was reduced  to $120  before she\r\n\ndeparted Kuwait. \r\n\n          Immediately upon her  arrival at appellant's  apartment\r\n\nin Quincy,  Massachusetts, on August 28,  1992, Gedara's passport\r\n\nwas confiscated by  appellant, who told her  that she was  not to\r\n\nleave the apartment  alone.   She was  not permitted  to use  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The  facts are related in  the light most  favorable to the\r\nverdicts.   See United States v.  Tejeda, 974 F.2d 210,  212 (1st\r                                                  \r\nCir. 1992).\r\r\n\ntelephone or the mails,  speak with anyone other than  the Alzan-\r\n\nkis, nor  even to venture onto the balcony or look out the apart-\r\n\nment windows.  Appellant told Gedara that the American police, as\r\n\nwell  as  the  neighbors,  would shoot  undocumented  aliens  who\r\n\nventured out alone.\r\n\n          During the  four months she remained  in the apartment,\r\n\nGedara was assaulted twice.   On one occasion, when  Gedara asked\r\n\nthat the  volume be turned down  on the television while  she was\r\n\ntrying to sleep,  appellant grabbed and threw  her bodily against\r\n\nthe  wall.  On another occasion, Abair Alzanki slapped Gedara and\r\n\nspat in her face when she failed to turn off a monitor.  \r\n\n          The  Alzankis deliberately  risked  Gedara's health  by\r\n\ncompelling  her to work fifteen  hours a day  at hard, repetitive\r\n\ntasks.   She was  required to clean  the apartment  on a constant\r\n\nbasis with  caustic and noxious chemicals, without the benefit of\r\n\nrespiratory protection,  and her requests for  rubber gloves were\r\n\nrefused.   Later, after the noxious fumes caused Gedara to faint,\r\n\nfall, and injure  her ribs, the Alzankis  withheld medical treat-\r\n\nment.  They also refused to  let Gedara have dental treatment for\r\n\nan abscessed tooth.  \r\n\n          Finally,  though affluent,  the Alzankis  denied Gedara\r\n\nadequate food, which resulted  in serious symptoms of malnourish-\r\n\nment, including  enlarged abdomen, massive hair  loss, and cessa-\r\n\ntion of menstrual cycles.   She was provided with only two house-\r\n\ncoats to wear  and allowed to  sleep and sit  only on the  floor.\r\n\n                                3\r                                          3\r\r\n\nOnce, after Gedara accidentally  broke a humidifier, the Alzankis\r\n\nthreatened to withhold all her wages.  \r\n\n          In addition  to the physical abuse  and inhumane treat-\r\n\nment,  Gedara was threatened     on almost a  daily basis    with\r\n\ndeportation, death or serious harm should she  disobey the Alzan-\r\n\nkis' orders.  On  numerous occasions, the Alzankis threatened  to\r\n\ndeport  her to Kuwait, and not allow  her to return to Sri Lanka.\r\n\nAppellant threatened to  kill her if the Alzankis'  newborn child\r\n\n   suffering from spina bifida    were to die while appellant was\r\n\naway  in New York.  The climate  of fear was enhanced by Gedara's\r\n\nwitnessing one incident involving Talal Alzanki's  physical abuse\r\n\nof  Abair, and by  learning from Abair  that he had  struck Abair\r\n\nagain  shortly thereafter.   On  another occasion,  Abair Alzanki\r\n\nthreatened to sew up Gedara's mouth with a needle and thread, and\r\n\nthrow her into the ocean.  \r\n\n          On  December 17,  1992, after  confiding her  plight to\r\n\nnurses  who came to the apartment  to care for the Alzankis' sick\r\n\nchild, Gedara fled the  apartment and reported her ordeal  to the\r\n\nlocal police.   Appellant  later  complained to  the police  that\r\n\nGedara  should be returned, because she \"belonged to him\" and \"he\r\n\nhad a contract for her.\"  \r\n\n          A federal  grand jury returned a  two-count indictment,\r\n\ncharging  the  Alzankis with  conspiring  to  hold, and  holding,\r\n\nGedara in involuntary servitude, in violation of 18 U.S.C.    371\r\n\nand 1584.  At trial, the Alzankis testified  in their own behalf;\r\n\nGedara  testified for the prosecution.  Due to a medical emergen-\r\n\n                                4\r                                          4\r\r\n\ncy,  a mistrial was  declared as to  Abair Alzanki, prior  to her\r\n\ncross-examination.   The government nonetheless agreed  to permit\r\n\nher  direct testimony to remain  in evidence.   The jury returned\r\n\nguilty verdicts  against  Talal  Alzanki on  both  counts.    The\r\n\ndistrict  court  sentenced him  to one  year  and one  day, which\r\n\nrepresented a  downward departure from the  18-to-24 month guide-\r\n\nline sentencing range, and to a modest restitutionary sentence.  \r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          Appellant  challenges  certain  jury instructions;  the\r\n\nsufficiency of the evidence  supporting both convictions; various\r\n\nevidentiary rulings;  the government's closing argument;  and the\r\n\n$13,403.00 restitutionary sentence imposed by the district court.\r\n\nA.  The Scope of the Involuntary Servitude Statute\r          A.  The Scope of the Involuntary Servitude Statute\r                                                            \r\n\n          Section 1584 proscribes involuntary servitude.2  It  is\r\n\nnot  to be  read  so narrowly  as  to pose  Thirteenth  Amendment\r\n\nproblems.  United States  v. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931,  945 (1988)\r                                                \r\n\n(\"Congress'  use  of the  constitutional  language  in a  statute\r\n\nenacted pursuant  to its constitutional authority  to enforce the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2At the time of the offense, the statute provided: \r\n\n          Whoever  knowingly  and  willfully  holds  to\r\n          involuntary servitude or sells into  any con-\r\n          dition  of  involuntary servitude,  any other\r\n          person  for  any term,  or brings  within the\r\n          United States  any person  so held, shall  be\r\n          fined not more than $5,000 or  imprisoned not\r\n          more than five years, or both.  \r\n\n18 U.S.C.   1584 (1992).  \r\n\n                                5\r                                          5\r\r\n\nThirteenth Amendment guarantee makes the conclusion that Congress\r\n\nintended  the  phrase to  have the  same  meaning in  both places\r\n\nlogical,  if  not inevitable.   In  the  absence of  any contrary\r\n\nindications, we therefore give  effect to congressional intent by\r\n\nconstruing 'involuntary  servitude' in a way  consistent with the\r\n\nunderstanding of  the Thirteenth Amendment that  prevailed at the\r\n\ntime  of   1584's enactment.\"); see also United States v. Booker,\r                                                                          \r\n\n655  F.2d 562, 564-65 (4th Cir. 1981); United States v.

In sum,  the requisite  compulsion\r               \r\n\nunder section 1584 obtains when  an individual, through an actual\r\n\nor threatened  use of  physical or legal  coercion, intentionally\r                                            \r\n\ncauses  the oppressed  person  reasonably to  believe, given  her\r\n\n\"special  vulnerabilities,\" that  she has  no alternative  but to\r\n\nremain in involuntary  service for  a time.   See Kozminski,  487\r                                                                     \r\n\nU.S. at 952-53; United  States v.

The Instruction on Involuntary Servitude\r                                                            \r\n\n          Appellant asserts three challenges to the jury instruc-\r\n\ntion defining  the substantive offense  of involuntary servitude.\r\n\nFirst,  he argues that the  court misled the  jury into believing\r\n\nthat psychological pressure alone  could establish the  requisite\r\n\nelement of compulsion, by defining \"physical force\" as encompass-\r\n\ning \"the notion  of compulsion, coercion, power,  violence.\"  The\r\n\ndistrict court's instruction stated:\r\n\n          [T]he government has to prove that the defen-\r\n          dant held Ms. Gedara in involuntary servitude\r\n          by  using or  threatening physical  force, or\r\n          using or threatening legal coercion.\r\n\n          Physical  force includes  restraint, physical\r\n          restraint,  locking somebody  up, or  in some\r\n          other way  restraining  the person.   It  in-\r\n          cludes  physically injuring  the person.   It\r\n          includes the notion of  compulsion, coercion,\r\n          power, violence.   And the government  has to\r                         \r\n          prove that the defendant held or participated\r\n          in  holding  Ms.  Gedara  by  using  physical\r\n          force,  or by  threatening  to  use  physical\r\n          force.\r\n\n(Emphasis  added.)   Appellant theorizes that  the jury  may have\r\n\nmisinterpreted the term \"power,\" in light of the expert testimony\r\n\nproffered by the government, see infra Section II.D.1, that \"[a]n\r                                                \r\n\nunequal  power relationship is where there is a subordinate and a\r\n\ndominant  person.    It  is generally  defined  by  the authority\r\n\nperson, and  it is unequal because of that authority relationship\r\n\nthat exists between the two parties.\"    \r\n\n                                9\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          The argument is without merit.  The challenged instruc-\r\n\ntion,  viewed against  the  backdrop of  the  entire charge,  see\r                                                                           \r\n\nTutiven,  40 F.3d at 8, left no doubt whatever that psychological\r                 \r\n\npressure alone would not satisfy the \"force or threat\" element of\r\n\nthe involuntary servitude offense.5\r\n\n          Second, appellant claims that the district court failed\r\n\nto instruct the jury that  any fear engendered in Gedara  must be\r\n\nshown to  have been \"reasonable.\"   But,  in fact, the  court in-\r\n\nstructed the  jury to  decide \"whether  the service  was involun-\r\n\ntary[] [and] whether Ms. Gedara reasonably believed that she  had\r                                                             \r\n\nno choice  except to remain in the service of the Alzankis.\"  The\r\n\ndistrict court's references to subjective considerations, such as\r\n\n\"whether [Gedara]  was personally  in fear  of physical or  other\r\n\nmeans of coercion,\" occurred  in the course of its  discussion of\r\n\nthe  types of evidence the  jury could weigh  in deciding whether\r                                \r\n\nGedara's belief     that she had  no other choice     was reason-\r                                                                           \r\n\nable.  See also infra note 6.   The trial judge assuredly did not\r                               \r\n\nsuggest that a mere finding that Gedara harbored fears    however\r\n\nunreasonably    was enough  to establish compulsion under section\r\n\n1584.  It  was entirely proper  to instruct the jury  to consider\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5In  the final  jury charge,  the  trial judge  provided un-\r\nmistakably  clear guidance  against  any  such  misunderstanding:\r\n\"But [Talal Alzanki] cannot be convicted if you find he used only\r                                                  \r\npsychological means to compel  her, if he played mind  games with\r\nher.  That's not enough.  The government does have  to prove that\r                                 \r\nhe used . . . or threatened physical or legal coercion.\"\r\n     Moreover,  the  preliminary  jury   instructions  explained:\r\n\"Now,  involuntary servitude . . . means a condition of servitude\r\nin which  the victim is forced  to work for the  defendant by the\r\nuse  or threat of physical restraint or physical injury or by the\r                                                                           \r\nuse or threat of coercion through law or legal process.\"  \r                                                                \r\n\n                                10\r                                          10\r\r\n\nGedara's background and experience in assessing whether her fears\r\n\nwere reasonable.6  \r\n\n          The final instructional challenge relates  to an uncer-\r\n\ntified transcript  of the  jury charge     containing a  clerical\r\n\nerror     made available  to the  jury during  its deliberations.\r\n\nThe transcript  mistakenly stated:  \"The government does not have\r                                                                      \r\n\nto  prove that  [Alzanki] used, .  . . or  threatened physical or\r\n\nlegal coercion.\"   Thus, there can be no question  that the tran-\r\n\nscript misstated an essential element of the crime charged. \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Similarly,  appellant suggests  that  the jury  instruction\r\ninvited the  impression that  \"extremely poor  working conditions\r\nand/or  special vulnerabilities of the  servant\" might serve as a\r\nproxy for actual  or threatened  use of physical  force or  legal\r\ncoercion.  However, the trial judge correctly instructed the jury\r\nthat\r\n\n          [the charged offense, involuntary servitude,]\r\n          encompasses  situations  in which  one person\r\n          holds  another in  servitude by  placing that\r\n          person in fear of such  physical restraint or\r                                  \r\n          injury or legal coercion.  It may be shown by\r                                                                 \r\n          evidence of extremely poor working conditions\r                            \r\n          and/or  special  vulnerabilities of  the ser-\r\n          vant.  \r\nIn addition, the jury  received proper instructions on the  roles\r\nof \"legal coercion\" and \"physical coercion\":  \r\n\n          [Legal coercion]  simply means the use of the\r\n          law, the legal process, or legal institutions\r\n          to compel  service.   The question  here that\r\n          you will need to determine  is:  Did the gov-\r\n          ernment prove beyond a reasonable  doubt that\r\n          the  defendant used or threatened physical or\r\n          legal coercion to compel Ms. Gedara's service\r\n          in the household?  \r\n\nOf course, the  jury is  presumed to have  followed the  instruc-\r\ntions.

Apparently  unclear on this point, the  jury later\r\n\nrequested further instructions:  \"[I]s there a conspiracy  if the\r\n\nsecond  person [the wife] .  . . joined  the agreement not volun-\r\n\ntarily but in fear?\"  The trial judge instructed: \r\n\n          The answer is yes.  If she agreed with him to\r\n          do an  act that  is unlawful, the  first ele-\r\n          ment, an  agreement, is satisfied.  You must,\r\n          however,  then go on  and consider the second\r\n          element, and determine whether  [the husband,\r\n          Talal  Alzanki], the  only  person who  is  a\r\n          defendant before you, joined into that agree-\r\n          ment  knowingly and  willfully as I  have de-\r\n          fined it to you.  \r\n\n          Appellant  correctly asserts  that a  viable conspiracy\r\n\ncharge under 18 U.S.C.   371 requires at least  two conspirators,\r\n\neach  possessed of  the requisite  criminal intent.    See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nUnited States v.

He argues that his  wife could not have  been the indis-\r\n\npensable  second  willing  party,  because he  coerced  her  into\r                          \r\n\nparticipating.   For the  latter proposition, he  relies on cases\r\n\nwhich hold  that a conspiracy charge will not lie if the putative\r\n\ncoconspirator  turned out  to  be an  undercover law  enforcement\r\n\nagent.

Indeed, nothing  in the  trial\r\n\nrecord intimates  a causal  link between Talal  Alzanki's abusive\r\n\nbehavior and Abair's participation in the conspiracy.  Cf.

We find no error. \r\n\n          The central fallacy in appellant's claim is its implic-\r\n\nit assumption  that no one other than  an \"involuntary servitude\"\r\n\nvictimologist could have qualified as an expert under Rule 702 in\r\n\nthe  present case.   This  thesis obviously  focuses only  on the\r                                                                   \r\n\n\"specialized knowledge\" requirement under  Rule 702, to the total\r\n\nexclusion of the ultimate standard  for admission    whether  the\r                                   \r\n\n\"specialized knowledge\" possessed by the witness \"will assist the\r                                                                       \r\n\ntrier of fact  to understand the evidence or to  determine a fact\r\n\nin issue .  . .  .\"   Fed.

It is quite another  to suggest that it is not \"reasonably\r\n\nlikely,\" see Echeverri,  982 F.2d  at 677, that  a somewhat  less\r                                \r\n\nspecialized victimologist might \"assist\" a  generalist factfinder\r\n\nin assessing  evidence of the exceedingly  uncommon phenomenon of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nannounced that  an objection  by either defendant  would preserve\r\nthe  claim for  both.

While the more\r\n\ngeneralized  nature of  the  proffered testimony  may temper  its\r\n\nprobative value to the factfinder, we do not think it can be said\r\n\nthat its relevance is negated entirely.12\r\n\n          The  record  reflects that  the  trial judge  carefully\r\n\nevaluated Ms. Burgess's  professional qualifications following  a\r\n\nlengthy voir dire.  Burgess testified that her principal training\r\n\nand experience related to  victims of sexual abuse, but  that she\r\n\nhad researched comparable clinical behavior manifested by victims\r\n\nof physical  abuse of a  non-sexual nature in  so-called \"unequal\r\n\npower\"  relationships  (e.g.,  battered  spouses  and  children).\r                                      \r\n\nBased  on her general research  and her personal interaction with\r\n\nhundreds  of  victims of  sexual  abuse,  Burgess testified  that\r\n\nGedara's behavioral response to the non-sexual abuse administered\r\n\nby the Alzankis was consistent with the behavior of abuse victims\r                                                                           \r\n\ngenerally.  It seems to us that expert testimony  on this subject\r                   \r\n\n    which the defense was  free to contradict     was \"reasonably\r\n\nlikely\"  to assist  the jury in  understanding and  assessing the\r\n\nevidence,  in  that the  matter  at  issue was  highly  material,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12The  rationale for the  trial judge's ruling  was much the\r\nsame: \r\n\n          It seems . . . that one doesn't have to be so\r\n          specialized as  to be  an expert on  the res-\r\n          ponse of a slavery victim to the master rath-\r\n          er than a  victim of other kinds of  abuse of\r\n          power in unequal relationships.\r\n\n                                22\r                                          22\r\r\n\nsomewhat technical,  and beyond  the realm of  acquired knowledge\r\n\nnormally possessed by lay jurors.\r\n\n          Finally, appellant  cites no  federal case law  for the\r\n\ncontention that allowing  an expert to  testify to her  empirical\r\n\nfindings on  the behavioral reactions of  abuse victims impermis-\r\n\nsibly suggests to the jury that the putative victim's allegations\r\n\nof abuse should be believed.  The overwhelming weight of authori-\r\n\nty suggests otherwise.   See, e.g., United States v.  Hadley, 918\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  848, 852  (9th Cir.  1990) (upholding  admission of  expert\r\n\ntestimony by  child psychiatrist as to  \"general behavior charac-\r\n\nteristics that may be exhibited in children who have been sexual-\r\n\nly abused\"),  cert. dismissed, 113  S.Ct. 486  (1992); Server  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nMizell,  902  F.2d 611,  615 (7th  Cir.  1990); United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nPierre,  812 F.2d 417,  419 (8th Cir. 1987).   Moreover, the able\r                \r\n\ntrial  judge left  no room  for doubting  that the  jury remained\r\n\nperfectly free to reject Burgess's expert opinion, as well as its\r\n\npredicate assumption.13 \r\n\n     2. \"Other Acts\" Evidence (Rule 404(b)) \r               2. \"Other Acts\" Evidence (Rule 404(b))\r                                                     \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     13The  judge firmly  cautioned the  jury immediately  before\r\nBurgess testified: \r\n\n          The witness  who is about to  testify is what\r\n          we call an expert witness.

We disagree.  \r\n\n          The Rule 404(b) bar is not  implicated unless the chal-\r\n\nlenged \"other crimes, wrongs, or acts are relevant exclusively to\r                                                                        \r\n\ninstigate  an inference that the defendant is more likely to have\r\n\nacted in similar fashion  by committing the offense for  which he\r\n\nis  on  trial.\"   Tutiven, 40  F.3d at  5  (emphasis added).

Gedara likewise would have been especially vulnerable\r\n\nto the coercive force of  appellant's frequent threats to  punish\r\n\nher disobedience by returning  her to Kuwait, rather than  to her\r                                                      \r\n\nnative home in Sri Lanka.   Moreover, appellant's own familiarity\r\n\nwith Kuwaiti customs could generate the reasonable inference that\r\n\n                                26\r                                          26\r\r\n\nappellant  played  on  Gedara's  isolation  and  vulnerabilities,\r\n\nmaking it more probable that he acted with the requisite specific\r                                                                           \r\n\nintent  to subject her to involuntary  servitude.  Indeed, appel-\r                \r\n\nlant sought to capitalize on the very same evidence by arguing to\r\n\nthe  jury that he should  not be convicted  since his experiences\r\n\ngrowing up  in Kuwait had never  put him on fair  notice that his\r\n\ntreatment of Gedara  might be considered  criminal in other  cul-\r\n\ntures. \r\n\n     4.   Hearsay Testimony\r               4.   Hearsay Testimony\r                                     \r\n\n          Appellant next challenges, as inadmissible hearsay, the\r\n\ntestimony given  by several  nurses and a  respiratory specialist\r\n\nwho  came to  the Alzankis'  apartment to  care for  their ailing\r\n\nchild, and by a police officer who interviewed Gedara immediately\r\n\nafter  she fled the  apartment.  These  witnesses related various\r\n\ncontemporaneous  statements Gedara  made to  them concerning  the\r\n\nharsh conditions  and inhumane  treatment she experienced  at the\r\n\nhands  of the Alzankis.   The government  offered their testimony\r\n\nunder  Rule 801(d)(1)(B) (prior  consistent statements offered to\r\n\nrebut charge of recent fabrication).  The district court admitted\r\n\ntheir  testimony  under Rule  803(3)  (statements of  declarant's\r\n\nthen-existing state of mind).  We review for abuse of discretion.\r\n\nUnited States v. Paulino, 13 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1994).  \r                                  \r\n\n          Some of the challenged testimony clearly was admissible\r\n\nunder Rule 803(3), such as Gedara's contemporaneous statements as\r\n\nto her state of mind     that she was afraid, hungry,  exhausted.\r\n\nOn the  other hand, Rule 803(3)  has been held not  to allow more\r\n\n                                27\r                                          27\r\r\n\nexpansive statements elaborating upon  the underlying reasons for\r\n\nthe  declarant's  state of  mind.

In any event, we may affirm the district court ruling on\r\n\nany  ground apparent from the appellate record.

See Tome v. United States,  115 S. Ct. 696 (1995); United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

See United States v. Montague,  958 F.2d 1094,\r                                                          \r\n\n1095 (D.C. Cir. 1992).  \r\n\nE.  The Restitutionary Sentence\r          E.

See  United States v.  Dietz, 950 F.2d  50, 55 (1st  Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1991).15    Appellant's  utter  failure to  object  disabled  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     15Indeed, as concerns the first contention, appellant flatly\r\nstated  at sentencing that he \"would leave  it up to the Court to\r                                                                           \r\ndetermine what is an appropriate restitution figure.\" Nor  did he\r                                                             \r\ncite to  the two statutes upon  which he now relies.   Rather, he\r\nleft  the  district court  with  the clear  impression  that some\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                29\r                                          29\r\r\n\nsentencing court from making a reasoned assessment of the present\r\n\nclaims  in the  first  instance, and  from  making the  predicate\r\n\nfactual findings upon which  the claims depend.  For  example, as\r\n\nconcerns  appellant's second claim,  the government responds that\r\n\nthe  restitutionary sentence  did  not include  reimbursement  to\r                                                \r\n\noffset  leave time Gedara took to help the government prepare its\r\n\ncase,  but merely to reimburse  her for lost  wages occasioned by\r\n\nhaving  to leave her new  employment to obtain  treatment for the\r\n\ndebilitating stress she experienced during her four-month ordeal.\r\n\nThe government concedes  that reimbursement  for Gedara's  assis-\r\n\ntance in preparing for trial would be  problematic as a matter of\r\n\nlaw, but appellant's failure  to alert the district court  to the\r\n\nclaim,  raised for the first  time on appeal,  prevented the sen-\r\n\ntencing  court from clarifying  the factual basis  for its resti-\r                                                     \r\n\ntutionary sentence.  Lastly, appellant's only attempt at address-\r\n\ning the government's waiver argument    that he promptly appealed\r\n\nthe restitutionary sentence    is  no answer at all.  Nor  did he\r\n\nrequest reconsideration of the restitutionary sentence.  See Fed.\r                                                                      \r\n\nR. Crim. P.  35(c); cf.

The Alzanki family prevented Gedara from leaving their residence, by retaining her passport and warning her that she would be subject to arrest and physical abuse by the Kuwaiti police should she venture outside.  Gedara was informed that she soon would be sent to the United States to work for appellant Talal Alzanki and his wife, Abair, at a monthly salary of $250, which was reduced to $120 before she departed Kuwait.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately upon her arrival at appellant's apartment in Quincy, Massachusetts, on August 28, 1992, Gedara's passport was confiscated by appellant, who told her that she was not to leave the apartment alone.  She was not permitted to use the telephone or the mails, speak with anyone other than the Alzankis, nor even to venture onto the balcony or look out the apartment windows.  Appellant told Gedara that the American police, as well as the neighbors, would shoot undocumented aliens who ventured out alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the four months she remained in the apartment, Gedara was assaulted twice.  On one occasion, when Gedara asked that the volume be turned down on the television while she was trying to sleep, appellant grabbed and threw her bodily against the wall.  On another occasion, Abair Alzanki slapped Gedara and spat in her face when she failed to turn off a monitor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Alzankis deliberately risked Gedara's health by compelling her to work fifteen hours a day at hard, repetitive tasks.  She was required to clean the apartment on a constant basis with caustic and noxious chemicals, without the benefit of respiratory protection, and her requests for rubber gloves were refused.  Later, after the noxious fumes caused Gedara to faint, fall, and injure her ribs, the Alzankis withheld medical treatment.  They also refused to let Gedara have dental treatment for an abscessed tooth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, though affluent, the Alzankis denied Gedara adequate food, which resulted in serious symptoms of malnourishment, including enlarged abdomen, massive hair loss, and cessation of menstrual cycles.  She was provided with only two housecoats to wear and allowed to sleep and sit only on the floor.  Once, after Gedara accidentally broke a humidifier, the Alzankis threatened to withhold all her wages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the physical abuse and inhumane treatment, Gedara was threatened--on almost a daily basis--with deportation, death or serious harm should she disobey the Alzankis' orders.  On numerous occasions, the Alzankis threatened to deport her to Kuwait, and not allow her to return to Sri Lanka.  Appellant threatened to kill her if the Alzankis' newborn child--suffering from spina bifida--were to die while appellant was away in New York.  The climate of fear was enhanced by Gedara's witnessing one incident involving Talal Alzanki's physical abuse of Abair, and by learning from Abair that he had struck Abair again shortly thereafter.  On another occasion, Abair Alzanki threatened to sew up Gedara's mouth with a needle and thread, and throw her into the ocean.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 17, 1992, after confiding her plight to nurses who came to the apartment to care for the Alzankis' sick child, Gedara fled the apartment and reported her ordeal to the local police.  Appellant later complained to the police that Gedara should be returned, because she \"belonged to him\" and \"he had a contract for her.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment, charging the Alzankis with conspiring to hold, and holding, Gedara in involuntary servitude, in violation of 18 U.S.C.

Due to a medical emergency, a mistrial was declared as to Abair Alzanki, prior to her cross-examination.  The government nonetheless agreed to permit her direct testimony to remain in evidence.  The jury returned guilty verdicts against Talal Alzanki on both counts.  The district court sentenced him to one year and one day, which represented a downward departure from the 18-to-24 month guideline sentencing range, and to a modest restitutionary sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant challenges certain jury instructions;  the sufficiency of the evidence supporting both convictions;  various evidentiary rulings;  the government's closing argument;  and the $13,403.00 restitutionary sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>A.

Kuhn, 316 F.Supp. 271, 281 (S.D.N.Y.1970), aff'd, 443 F.2d 264 (2d Cir.1971), aff'd, 407 U.S. 258, 92 S.Ct. 2099, 32 L.Ed.2d 728 (1972).  In sum, the requisite compulsion under section 1584 obtains when an individual, through an actual or threatened use of physical or legal coercion, intentionally causes the oppressed person reasonably to believe, given her \"special vulnerabilities,\" that she has no alternative but to remain in involuntary service for a time.  See Kozminski, 487 U.S. at 952-53, 108 S.Ct. at 2764-65;  United States v. Mussry, 726 F.2d 1448, 1451-52 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, Singman v.

Kozminski, 487 U.S. at 952, 108 S.Ct. at 2765 (\"This definition encompasses those cases in which the defendant holds the victim in servitude by placing the victim in fear of such physical restraint or injury or legal coercion.\")  (emphasis added).  Moreover, in assessing whether the government has succeeded in establishing the requisite compulsion, the jury is to consider the victim's \"special vulnerabilities,\" with a view to \"whether the physical or legal coercion or threats thereof could plausibly have compelled the victim to serve [against her will].\"  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  In other words, conviction under section 1584 is precluded absent proof, inter alia, that the victim was intentionally held in service against her will (i) by actual physical restraint or physical force or (ii) by legal coercion or (iii) by plausible threats of physical harm or legal coercion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the challenged jury instructions against the backdrop of the entire charge, see United States v. Tutiven, 40 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1994) (citing United States v. Serino, 835 F.2d 924, 930 (1st Cir.1987)), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1391, 131 L.Ed.2d 243 (1995), focusing our inquiry on whether the instructions adequately explained the law or \" 'whether they tended to confuse or mislead the jury on the controlling issues.' \"  Brown v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 891 F.2d 337, 353 (1st Cir.1989) (citation omitted), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 937, 110 S.Ct. 3217, 110 L.Ed.2d 664 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Instruction on Involuntary Servitude</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant asserts three challenges to the jury instruction defining the substantive offense of involuntary servitude.  First, he argues that the court misled the jury into believing that psychological pressure alone could establish the requisite element of compulsion, by defining \"physical force\" as encompassing \"the notion of compulsion, coercion, power, violence.\"   The district court's instruction stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>[T]he government has to prove that the defendant held Ms. Gedara in involuntary servitude by using or threatening physical force, or using or threatening legal coercion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Physical force includes restraint, physical restraint, locking somebody up, or in some other way restraining the person.  It includes physically injuring the person.  It includes the notion of compulsion, coercion, power, violence.  And the government has to prove that the defendant held or participated in holding Ms. Gedara by using physical force, or by threatening to use physical force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)   Appellant theorizes that the jury may have misinterpreted the term \"power,\" in light of the expert testimony proffered by the government, see infra Section II.D.1, that \"[a]n unequal power relationship is where there is a subordinate and a dominant person.  It is generally defined by the authority person, and it is unequal because of that authority relationship that exists between the two parties.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument is without merit.  The challenged instruction, viewed against the backdrop of the entire charge, see Tutiven, 40 F.3d at 8, left no doubt whatever that psychological pressure alone would not satisfy the \"force or threat\" element of the involuntary servitude offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, appellant claims that the district court failed to instruct the jury that any fear engendered in Gedara must be shown to have been \"reasonable.\"   But, in fact, the court instructed the jury to decide \"whether the service was involuntary[ ] [and] whether Ms. Gedara reasonably believed that she had no choice except to remain in the service of the Alzankis.\"   The district court's references to subjective considerations, such as \"whether [Gedara] was personally in fear of physical or other means of coercion,\" occurred in the course of its discussion of the types of evidence the jury could weigh in deciding whether Gedara's belief --that she had no other choice--was reasonable.  See also infra note 6.  The trial judge assuredly did not suggest that a mere finding that Gedara harbored fears--however unreasonably--was enough to establish compulsion under section 1584.  It was entirely proper to instruct the jury to consider Gedara's background and experience in assessing whether her fears were reasonable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final instructional challenge relates to an uncertified transcript of the jury charge--containing a clerical error--made available to the jury during its deliberations.  The transcript mistakenly stated:  \"The government does not have to prove that [Alzanki] used, ... or threatened physical or legal coercion.\"   Thus, there can be no question that the transcript misstated an essential element of the crime charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury had been deliberating for seven hours by the time it requested the transcript for the explicit purpose of reviewing witness testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Thus, there is but a remote possibility that the jury even consulted the portion of the transcript containing the typographical error.   Furthermore, even assuming the jury consulted the relevant portion of the transcript, it is virtually inconceivable that it would have credited this lone typographical error over four correctly transcribed statements, and the five correct oral statements it had been given in the courtroom earlier, especially since the transcript itself alerted the jury with the imprint:  \"Rough Draft-Not Certified.\"   Cf. United States v. DeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1317-1318 (1st Cir.1994) (\"Our review of the instructions reveals that the district court referred to the 'beyond a reasonable doubt' standard no less than twelve times in the nine pages of jury instructions preceding the isolated section challenged here.  This overwhelming number of correct references negated any chance that the contested statements were misconstrued by the jury as somehow reducing the government's burden of proof\"), cert. denied, Bonasia v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 947, 130 L.Ed.2d 890 (1995);  United States v. Glenn, 828 F.2d 855, 861 (1st Cir.1987) (\"This [challenged] phrase [in the jury instructions] ... 'may not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.' \")  (quoting United States v. DeVincent, 632 F.2d 147, 152 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 986, 101 S.Ct. 405, 66 L.Ed.2d 249 (1980)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the fact that the trial judge correctly and repeatedly explained this element to the jury earlier in the courtroom, and absent any indication that the jury even noted, let alone credited, the isolated misstatement in the transcript, we find no prejudice.  Cf. United States v. Griley, 814 F.2d 967, 975 (4th Cir.1987) (where deliberating jury received tape recording of jury instructions at defendant's criminal trial, as well as instructions given in unrelated civil case, conviction upheld on grounds that appellant failed to demonstrate prejudice and trial court gave proper curative instruction);  United States v. North, 746 F.2d 627, 631-32 (9th Cir.)  (affirming conviction even though a search warrant affidavit, excluded from evidence, was sent to jury room by mistake;  finding \"no reasonable possibility that [the warrant] could have affected the verdict\"), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1058, 105 S.Ct. 1773, 84 L.Ed.2d 832 (1985), overruled on other grounds, Jacobson v. United States, 503 U.S. 540, 112 S.Ct. 1535, 118 L.Ed.2d 174 (1992).  There was no reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Conspiracy Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant claims that the district court incorrectly instructed the jury on an essential element of the conspiracy charge, by stating that he could be found guilty even if his only alleged coconspirator, Abair Alzanki, involuntarily cooperated under duress.  Apparently unclear on this point, the jury later requested further instructions:  \"[I]s there a conspiracy if the second person [the wife] ... joined the agreement not voluntarily but in fear?\"   The trial judge instructed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>The answer is yes.  If she agreed with him to do an act that is unlawful, the first element, an agreement, is satisfied.  You must, however, then go on and consider the second element, and determine whether [the husband, Talal Alzanki], the only person who is a defendant before you, joined into that agreement knowingly and willfully as I have defined it to you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant correctly asserts that a viable conspiracy charge under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371 requires at least two conspirators, each possessed of the requisite criminal intent.  See, e.g., United States v. Penagaricano-Soler, 911 F.2d 833, 841 (1st Cir.1990).  He argues that his wife could not have been the indispensable second willing party, because he coerced her into participating.  For the latter proposition, he relies on cases which hold that a conspiracy charge will not lie if the putative coconspirator turned out to be an undercover law enforcement agent.  See, e.g., United States v. Nason, 9 F.3d 155, 161 &amp; n. 2 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1331, 127 L.Ed.2d 678 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the present claim is raised for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error.  DeMasi, 40 F.3d at 1318;  United States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 100 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 844, 108 S.Ct. 137, 98 L.Ed.2d 94 (1987).  The burden therefore rests with appellant to establish that the error was \"clear,\" in the sense that it was \"obvious,\" that it affected \"substantial rights,\" and that failure to vacate the conspiracy conviction would result in a \"miscarriage of justice.\"  United States v. Olano, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-79, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note at the outset that a \"generalized fear\" of harm would not have afforded Abair Alzanki a viable defense to the conspiracy charge.  See, e.g., United States v. Stevens, 985 F.2d 1175, 1182 (2d Cir.1993) (district court properly rejected request to instruct jury that generalized fear of harm, without more, would compel acquittal).  Moreover, neither defendant contended at trial that Abair Alzanki conformed her will or behavior in response to duress.  Indeed, nothing in the trial record intimates a causal link between Talal Alzanki's abusive behavior and Abair's participation in the conspiracy.  Cf. Slater v. United States, 562 F.2d 58, 62 (1st Cir.1976) (defendant convicted of Kickback Act violation, an essential element of which is the intimidation of others, was properly convicted as well of conspiring with those whom he intimidated).  Thus, the district court correctly advised the jury that the appropriate inquiry was whether Talal Alzanki \"joined ... that agreement knowingly and willfully.\"   As the evidence plainly supported such a finding, there was no error, let alone plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant next contends that the evidence was insufficient to convict on the substantive \"involuntary servitude\" charge.  We review \"the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, in order to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  All reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the verdict and any credibility determination must be compatible with the judgment of conviction.\"  United States v. Tuesta-Toro, 29 F.3d 771, 776 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting United States v. Tejeda, 974 F.2d 210, 212 (1st Cir.1992)), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 947, 130 L.Ed.2d 890 (1995).  There was ample evidence to enable a rational jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, each essential element of the substantive offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the record discloses only a few isolated instances in which any physical force whatever was used against Gedara.  These incidents, he argues, did not approach, either in frequency or severity, but see supra p. 3, the level of physical abuse present in the typical involuntary servitude case.  Furthermore, he says, conditions in the Alzanki apartment were neither squalid nor jail-like;  whereas in the typical involuntary servitude case, the victim is exposed to severe physical abuse, as well as confinement in extremely uncomfortable quarters.  See, e.g., United States v. Kozminski, 821 F.2d 1186, 1188-89 (6th Cir.1987) (squalid lodgings, without plumbing;  rotten food;  numerous instances of slapping, choking, kicking), aff'd, 487 U.S. 931, 108 S.Ct. 2751, 101 L.Ed.2d 788 (1988);  United States v. Harris, 701 F.2d 1095, 1098 (4th Cir.1983) (beatings with a rubber hose and confinement to quarters (\"the jail\") in retaliation for attempted escape), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1214, 103 S.Ct. 3554, 77 L.Ed.2d 1400 (1983);  Booker, 655 F.2d at 565-66 (numerous retaliatory beatings following escape attempts);  Bibbs, 564 F.2d at 1167 (holding victims at gunpoint;  beating and threatening to kill any who attempted escape).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gedara testified that during her four-month ordeal in their apartment she was physically assaulted by the Alzankis on two occasions and contemporaneously informed that their purpose was to keep her \"in her place.\"   The physical violence appellant directed at Gedara was by no means trifling in degree.  The evidence revealed that appellant punished Gedara--merely for asking him to turn down the television--by throwing her bodily against the wall.  Moreover, she was kept in a serious state of malnutrition, deprived of medical care, and subjected to threats of deportation, physical harm and even death.  Given her experience as a domestic servant in Kuwait, see supra p. 2,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and in the Alzanki apartment in Quincy, the jury was entitled to infer that Gedara reasonably believed these threats.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant correctly asserts that the requisite \"compulsion\" is not established in circumstances where an available alternative to continued service is merely \"exceedingly bad.\"   See Kozminski, 487 U.S. at 938, 108 S.Ct. at 2757 (quoting Shackney, 333 F.2d at 486).   Instead, the evidence must establish that the victim reasonably believed she was left with no alternative to continued servitude that was not the equivalent of \"imprisonment or worse.\"  Shackney, 333 F.2d at 486.   See, e.g., Steirer v. Bethlehem Area Sch. Dist., 987 F.2d 989, 1000 (3d Cir.)  (community service requirement for high school graduation not a form of involuntary servitude, as student has choice of foregoing graduation) (citing Shackney, 333 F.2d at 486), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 85, 126 L.Ed.2d 53 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence that Gedara herself was well aware of the severely restrictive conditions encountered by household servants in Kuwait would enable the jury rationally to conclude that Gedara--threatened with deportation to Kuwait and no prospect of returning to Sri Lanka and her family--confronted an alternative to continued involuntary service which she reasonably considered at least as severe as imprisonment, particularly when viewed in light of her \"special vulnerabilities.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Moreover, the reasonableness of her fear of deportation was substantiated by the undisputed evidence that she would become deportable immediately upon loss of her \"B-1\" visa status, which allowed her lawfully to remain in the United States only while in the employ of the Alzankis.  See 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1184(a)(1) (\"[U]pon failure to maintain the status under which [s]he was admitted, ... such alien will depart from the United States.\");  22 C.F.R. Sec. 41.31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the defense presented contrary testimony, the jury fairly could infer that the most efficacious threats are those the victim reasonably believes can be carried out.  Shackney, 333 F.2d at 486-87.   Cf. Booker, 655 F.2d 562 (threats, substantiated by severe beatings and assaults with firearms, coerced abductees into remaining at labor camp).  The jury was entitled to make its own credibility determinations, Tuesta-Toro, 29 F.3d at 776, and to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Gedara believed appellant's deportation threats to be plausible and that the alternative to continued involuntary servitude was at least as severe as imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Evidentiary Rulings</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The \"victimologist\" testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant filed an unsuccessful motion in limine to preclude the government from calling Ann Burgess, a \"victimologist,\" as an expert witness.  At trial, the government used Burgess to refute the Alzankis' principal \"defense\";  viz., that Gedara often ventured outside their unlocked apartment during her alleged involuntary servitude, and given the normal human instinct for self-preservation, one would expect an unrestrained person faced with actual or threatened physical abuse to flee from her abuser at the first opportunity.  Burgess countered this evidence with testimony that abuse victims often harbor the opposite impulse--overwhelmed by fear they remain with their abusers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that Burgess's expert qualifications related only to sexual abuse victimology, not the behavioral responses of domestic workers subjected to involuntary servitude.  Thus, appellant argues, the expert testimony presented by Burgess was irrelevant and unhelpful to the jury, see Fed.R.Evid. 104(a), 702 (permitting use of expert testimony \"[i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact\") or, at the very least, its minimal probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, see Fed.R.Evid. 403.  Finally, appellant argues that the jury was swayed by Burgess's professional credentials, and her testimony amounted to impermissible \"bolstering\" of the allegations of abuse made by Gedara.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review challenges to expert-witness qualification only for manifest abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1183 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2714, 129 L.Ed.2d 840 (1994);  United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The \"gatekeeping function\" contemplated by Rule 702 essentially requires the trial judge to assess whether it is \"reasonably likely that the expert possesses specialized knowledge which will assist the trier better to understand a fact in issue.\"  Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1183 (citing Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993)) (emphasis added);  Apostol v. United States, 838 F.2d 595, 599 (1st Cir.1988) (noting that Rule 702 rulings invite a \"case-specific inquiry\").  We find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The central fallacy in appellant's claim is its implicit assumption that no one other than an \"involuntary servitude\" victimologist could have qualified as an expert under Rule 702 in the present case.  This thesis obviously focuses only on the \"specialized knowledge\" requirement under Rule 702, to the total exclusion of the ultimate standard for admission--whether the \"specialized knowledge\" possessed by the witness \"will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue....\"  Fed.R.Evid. 702.  It is one matter to acknowledge that a witness steeped in the behavioral reactions of Sri Lankan domestic servants abused by Kuwaiti nationals in the United States could be instructive (if not inordinately so) to a jury.  It is quite another to suggest that it is not \"reasonably likely,\" see Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 677, that a somewhat less specialized victimologist might \"assist\" a generalist factfinder in assessing evidence of the exceedingly uncommon phenomenon of domestic servant abuse in the present-day United States.  Id. at 783 (Rule 702 demands \"common sense inquiry\").  While the more generalized nature of the proffered testimony may temper its probative value to the factfinder, we do not think it can be said that its relevance is negated entirely.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reflects that the trial judge carefully evaluated Ms. Burgess's professional qualifications following a lengthy voir dire.  Burgess testified that her principal training and experience related to victims of sexual abuse, but that she had researched comparable clinical behavior manifested by victims of physical abuse of a non-sexual nature in so-called \"unequal power\" relationships (e.g., battered spouses and children).  Based on her general research and her personal interaction with hundreds of victims of sexual abuse, Burgess testified that Gedara's behavioral response to the non-sexual abuse administered by the Alzankis was consistent with the behavior of abuse victims generally.   It seems to us that expert testimony on this subject--which the defense was free to contradict--was \"reasonably likely\" to assist the jury in understanding and assessing the evidence, in that the matter at issue was highly material, somewhat technical, and beyond the realm of acquired knowledge normally possessed by lay jurors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant cites no federal case law for the contention that allowing an expert to testify to her empirical findings on the behavioral reactions of abuse victims impermissibly suggests to the jury that the putative victim's allegations of abuse should be believed.  The overwhelming weight of authority suggests otherwise.  See, e.g., United States v.

By contrast, the evidence admitted below bore special relevance to a pivotal element of the alleged offense quite apart from appellant's propensity to commit wrongful acts;  viz., the \"reasonableness\" of Gedara's stated fear that she would be a target of appellant's physical violence should she disobey him.  See United States v. Oreto, 37 F.3d 739, 749 (1st Cir.1994) (evidence of victim's awareness of defendant's prior bad acts against third parties is especially relevant to an element of the offense, i.e., the reasonableness of the stated basis for the victim's fear) (citing United States v.

See United States v. Figueroa, 976 F.2d 1446, 1455 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1346, 122 L.Ed.2d 728 (1993) (finding claim of ethnic bias waived, and no plain error).  We will reverse \"only if the error 'seriously affect[ed] the fundamental fairness and basic integrity of the proceedings.' \"  Tuesta-Toro, 29 F.3d at 775 (citing United States v. Carty, 993 F.2d 1005, 1012 n. 9 (1st Cir.1993)).  We find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government itself cautioned the jury during closing argument that appellant's mere status as a foreign national should play no part in their deliberations.  Further, at no point during the trial did the government make any inflammatory remark relating to the Alzankis' ethnic background or national origin.  See United States v. Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d 212, 221-22 (1st Cir.1994) (finding remarks not inflammatory because, inter alia, they \"serve [a] purpose other than to inflame\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1322, 131 L.Ed.2d 202 (1995).  Finally, unlike cases in which evidence of this type has been found marginally relevant at best, see, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez Cortes, 949 F.2d 532, 541-42 (1st Cir.1991) (finding that admission of defendant's Colombian identification card impermissibly invited jury to conclude that \"a person ... born in Colombia ... must be involved in drug trafficking\");  see also United States v. Doe, 903 F.2d 16, 18 (D.C.Cir.1990) (noting that prosecutor frequently referred to defendants as \"Jamaicans\" and stressed expert testimony to the effect that \"Jamaicans\" were known to be deeply involved in drug trafficking), prevailing Kuwaiti customs were highly probative on at least three issues material to the section 1584 prosecution.  See, e.g., Figueroa, 976 F.2d at 1455 (no plain error where evidence related to true source of large bank deposits in defendant's name, corroborated certain admissions by defendant, and bolstered credibility of important government witness whose credibility was challenged by defense).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it could be inferred that Gedara--as a former domestic servant in Kuwait--developed a \"special vulnerability\" to the Alzankis' threats, even though an American domestic worker might not have been placed \"reasonably\" in fear thereby.  See Kozminski, 487 U.S. at 952, 108 S.Ct. at 2765.   For example, the evidence relating to Kuwaiti customs and practices clearly tended to buttress the reasonableness of Gedara's stated belief in appellant's warnings that the American police, like their Kuwaiti counterparts, were under orders to shoot undocumented domestic workers who ventured out alone.  Gedara likewise would have been especially vulnerable to the coercive force of appellant's frequent threats to punish her disobedience by returning her to Kuwait, rather than to her native home in Sri Lanka.  Moreover, appellant's own familiarity with Kuwaiti customs could generate the reasonable inference that appellant played on Gedara's isolation and vulnerabilities, making it more probable that he acted with the requisite specific intent to subject her to involuntary servitude.  Indeed, appellant sought to capitalize on the very same evidence by arguing to the jury that he should not be convicted since his experiences growing up in Kuwait had never put him on fair notice that his treatment of Gedara might be considered criminal in other cultures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Hearsay Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant next challenges, as inadmissible hearsay, the testimony given by several nurses and a respiratory specialist who came to the Alzankis' apartment to care for their ailing child, and by a police officer who interviewed Gedara immediately after she fled the apartment.  These witnesses related various contemporaneous statements Gedara made to them concerning the harsh conditions and inhumane treatment she experienced at the hands of the Alzankis.  The government offered their testimony under Rule 801(d)(1)(B) (prior consistent statements offered to rebut charge of recent fabrication).  The district court admitted their testimony under Rule 803(3) (statements of declarant's then-existing state of mind).  We review for abuse of discretion.  United States v. Paulino, 13 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some of the challenged testimony clearly was admissible under Rule 803(3), such as Gedara's contemporaneous statements as to her state of mind--that she was afraid, hungry, exhausted.  On the other hand, Rule 803(3) has been held not to allow more expansive statements elaborating upon the underlying reasons for the declarant's state of mind.  See, e.g., United States v. Fontenot, 14 F.3d 1364, 1371 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 431, 130 L.Ed.2d 343 (1994);  United States v. Cohen, 631 F.2d 1223, 1225 (5th Cir.1980).  In any event, we may affirm the district court ruling on any ground apparent from the appellate record.  United States v. Norton, 26 F.3d 240, 244 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government was entitled to introduce the challenged testimony to establish the truth of the matter asserted, if (1) the declarant (viz., Gedara) testified at trial and was subject to cross-examination;  (2) the challenged statements and her trial testimony were consistent;  and (3) the challenged statements were offered to rebut an express or implied charge that the declarant recently fabricated her story, or became subject to some improper influence or motive to falsify after making the challenged statement.  See Tome v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 696, 130 L.Ed.2d 574 (1995);  United States v. Arias-Santana, 964 F.2d 1262, 1264 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Piva, 870 F.2d 753, 758 (1st Cir.1989).  All three criteria for admission under Rule 801(d)(1)(B) were met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Gedara testified consistently with her previous statements to the nurses, therapist, and police officer.  By suggesting, on cross-examination, that Gedara recently had met with a Hollywood producer interested in purchasing the film rights to her \"story,\" that she was engaged in a Hollywood bidding war, and that she had been interviewed by Boston newspapers to drum up publicity for her \"story,\" defense counsel plainly impugned Gedara's motives and just as clearly invited the government to respond--as it did--with corroborative evidence that Gedara had made statements consistent with her trial testimony long before the motivations attributed to her by the defense had ever arisen.  See United States v. Montague, 958 F.2d 1094, 1095 (D.C.Cir.1992).E. The Restitutionary Sentence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant contends that the restitutionary sentence imposed pursuant to the Victim and Witness Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3663(b)(2)(A), constituted error because it reimbursed Gedara for (1) lost overtime wages to which she was not entitled under the applicable law, see Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 213;  Massachusetts Wage and Hour Act, Mass.Gen.L.Ann. ch. 151;  (2) lost wages for time she took off from her job to assist the government in prosecuting its case against the Alzankis, but see Ratliff v. United States, 999 F.2d 1023, 1026 (6th Cir.1993);  and (3) psychological counseling for chronic stress symptoms attributable to her abusive treatment, but cf. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3663(b)(2)(A) (restitution only for \"bodily injury\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline to address appellant's challenges to the restitutionary sentence since these claims were never raised below.  See United States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 55 (1st Cir.1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Appellant's utter failure to object disabled the sentencing court from making a reasoned assessment of the present claims in the first instance, and from making the predicate factual findings upon which the claims depend.  For example, as concerns appellant's second claim, the government responds that the restitutionary sentence did not include reimbursement to offset leave time Gedara took to help the government prepare its case, but merely to reimburse her for lost wages occasioned by having to leave her new employment to obtain treatment for the debilitating stress she experienced during her four-month ordeal.  The government concedes that reimbursement for Gedara's assistance in preparing for trial would be problematic as a matter of law, but appellant's failure to alert the district court to the claim, raised for the first time on appeal, prevented the sentencing court from clarifying the factual basis for its restitutionary sentence.  Lastly, appellant's only attempt at addressing the government's waiver argument--that he promptly appealed the restitutionary sentence--is no answer at all.  Nor did he request reconsideration of the restitutionary sentence.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c);  cf. United States v. Heilprin, 910 F.2d 471, 474 n. 5 (7th Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The facts are related in the light most favorable to the verdicts.

That's not enough.   The government does have to prove that he used ... or threatened physical or legal coercion.\"</p>\n        <p>Moreover, the preliminary jury instructions explained:  \"Now, involuntary servitude ... means a condition of servitude in which the victim is forced to work for the defendant by the use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury or by the use or threat of coercion through law or legal process.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Similarly, appellant suggests that the jury instruction invited the impression that \"extremely poor working conditions and/or special vulnerabilities of the servant\" might serve as a proxy for actual or threatened use of physical force or legal coercion.  However, the trial judge correctly instructed the jury that</p>\n        <p>[the charged offense, involuntary servitude,] encompasses situations in which one person holds another in servitude by placing that person in fear of such physical restraint or injury or legal coercion.  It may be shown by evidence of extremely poor working conditions and/or special vulnerabilities of the servant.</p>\n        <p>In addition, the jury received proper instructions on the roles of \"legal coercion\" and \"physical coercion\":</p>\n        <p>[Legal coercion] simply means the use of the law, the legal process, or legal institutions to compel service.  The question here that you will need to determine is:  Did the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used or threatened physical or legal coercion to compel Ms. Gedara's service in the household?</p>\n        <p>Of course, the jury is presumed to have followed the instructions.

See Kozminski, 487 U.S. at 948, 956, 108 S.Ct. at 2762, 2766.   To a foreign worker familiar with Kuwaiti customs and practices (for example, at trial there was evidence that Kuwaiti soldiers manned checkpoints to enforce restrictions on noncitizen movement, especially household servants), a threat of deportation in these circumstances plausibly may equate with imprisonment.

The Alzanki family prevented Gedara from leaving their residence, by retaining her passport and warning her that she would be subject to arrest and physical abuse by the Kuwaiti police should she venture outside.

On one occasion, when Gedara asked that the volume be turned down on the television while she was trying to sleep, appellant grabbed and threw her bodily against the wall.  On another occasion, Abair Alzanki slapped Gedara and spat in her face when she failed to turn off a monitor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Alzankis deliberately risked Gedara's health by compelling her to work fifteen hours a day at hard, repetitive tasks.  She was required to clean the apartment on a constant basis with caustic and noxious chemicals, without the benefit of respiratory protection, and her requests for rubber gloves were refused.  Later, after the noxious fumes caused Gedara to faint, fall, and injure her ribs, the Alzankis withheld medical treatment.  They also refused to let Gedara have dental treatment for an abscessed tooth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, though affluent, the Alzankis denied Gedara adequate food, which resulted in serious symptoms of malnourishment, including enlarged abdomen, massive hair loss, and cessation of menstrual cycles.  She was provided with only two housecoats to wear and allowed to sleep and sit only on the floor.  Once, after Gedara accidentally broke a humidifier, the Alzankis threatened to withhold all her wages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the physical abuse and inhumane treatment, Gedara was threatened--on almost a daily basis--with deportation, death or serious harm should she disobey the Alzankis' orders.  On numerous occasions, the Alzankis threatened to deport her to Kuwait, and not allow her to return to Sri Lanka.  Appellant threatened to kill her if the Alzankis' newborn child--suffering from spina bifida--were to die while appellant was away in New York.  The climate of fear was enhanced by Gedara's witnessing one incident involving Talal Alzanki's physical abuse of Abair, and by learning from Abair that he had struck Abair again shortly thereafter.  On another occasion, Abair Alzanki threatened to sew up Gedara's mouth with a needle and thread, and throw her into the ocean.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 17, 1992, after confiding her plight to nurses who came to the apartment to care for the Alzankis' sick child, Gedara fled the apartment and reported her ordeal to the local police.  Appellant later complained to the police that Gedara should be returned, because she \"belonged to him\" and \"he had a contract for her.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment, charging the Alzankis with conspiring to hold, and holding, Gedara in involuntary servitude, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Secs. 371 and 1584.  At trial, the Alzankis testified in their own behalf;  Gedara testified for the prosecution.  Due to a medical emergency, a mistrial was declared as to Abair Alzanki, prior to her cross-examination.  The government nonetheless agreed to permit her direct testimony to remain in evidence.  The jury returned guilty verdicts against Talal Alzanki on both counts.  The district court sentenced him to one year and one day, which represented a downward departure from the 18-to-24 month guideline sentencing range, and to a modest restitutionary sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant challenges certain jury instructions;  the sufficiency of the evidence supporting both convictions;  various evidentiary rulings;  the government's closing argument;  and the $13,403.00 restitutionary sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>A.

The Instruction on Involuntary Servitude</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant asserts three challenges to the jury instruction defining the substantive offense of involuntary servitude.  First, he argues that the court misled the jury into believing that psychological pressure alone could establish the requisite element of compulsion, by defining \"physical force\" as encompassing \"the notion of compulsion, coercion, power, violence.\"   The district court's instruction stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>[T]he government has to prove that the defendant held Ms. Gedara in involuntary servitude by using or threatening physical force, or using or threatening legal coercion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Physical force includes restraint, physical restraint, locking somebody up, or in some other way restraining the person.  It includes physically injuring the person.  It includes the notion of compulsion, coercion, power, violence.  And the government has to prove that the defendant held or participated in holding Ms. Gedara by using physical force, or by threatening to use physical force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)   Appellant theorizes that the jury may have misinterpreted the term \"power,\" in light of the expert testimony proffered by the government, see infra Section II.D.1, that \"[a]n unequal power relationship is where there is a subordinate and a dominant person.  It is generally defined by the authority person, and it is unequal because of that authority relationship that exists between the two parties.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument is without merit.

See also infra note 6.  The trial judge assuredly did not suggest that a mere finding that Gedara harbored fears--however unreasonably--was enough to establish compulsion under section 1584.  It was entirely proper to instruct the jury to consider Gedara's background and experience in assessing whether her fears were reasonable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final instructional challenge relates to an uncertified transcript of the jury charge--containing a clerical error--made available to the jury during its deliberations.  The transcript mistakenly stated:  \"The government does not have to prove that [Alzanki] used, ... or threatened physical or legal coercion.\"   Thus, there can be no question that the transcript misstated an essential element of the crime charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury had been deliberating for seven hours by the time it requested the transcript for the explicit purpose of reviewing witness testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Thus, there is but a remote possibility that the jury even consulted the portion of the transcript containing the typographical error.   Furthermore, even assuming the jury consulted the relevant portion of the transcript, it is virtually inconceivable that it would have credited this lone typographical error over four correctly transcribed statements, and the five correct oral statements it had been given in the courtroom earlier, especially since the transcript itself alerted the jury with the imprint:  \"Rough Draft-Not Certified.\"   Cf.

Apparently unclear on this point, the jury later requested further instructions:  \"[I]s there a conspiracy if the second person [the wife] ... joined the agreement not voluntarily but in fear?\"   The trial judge instructed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>The answer is yes.  If she agreed with him to do an act that is unlawful, the first element, an agreement, is satisfied.  You must, however, then go on and consider the second element, and determine whether [the husband, Talal Alzanki], the only person who is a defendant before you, joined into that agreement knowingly and willfully as I have defined it to you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant correctly asserts that a viable conspiracy charge under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371 requires at least two conspirators, each possessed of the requisite criminal intent.  See, e.g., United States v. Penagaricano-Soler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546889\"><a href=\"/opinion/546889/united-states-v-raul-enrique-penagaricano-soler/\"><span class=\"volume\">911</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span>, 841 (1st Cir.1990).  He argues that his wife could not have been the indispensable second willing party, because he coerced her into participating.  For the latter proposition, he relies on cases which hold that a conspiracy charge will not lie if the putative coconspirator turned out to be an undercover law enforcement agent.

Moreover, neither defendant contended at trial that Abair Alzanki conformed her will or behavior in response to duress.  Indeed, nothing in the trial record intimates a causal link between Talal Alzanki's abusive behavior and Abair's participation in the conspiracy.  Cf. Slater v.

Furthermore, he says, conditions in the Alzanki apartment were neither squalid nor jail-like;  whereas in the typical involuntary servitude case, the victim is exposed to severe physical abuse, as well as confinement in extremely uncomfortable quarters.

At trial, the government used Burgess to refute the Alzankis' principal \"defense\";  viz., that Gedara often ventured outside their unlocked apartment during her alleged involuntary servitude, and given the normal human instinct for self-preservation, one would expect an unrestrained person faced with actual or threatened physical abuse to flee from her abuser at the first opportunity.

It is one matter to acknowledge that a witness steeped in the behavioral reactions of Sri Lankan domestic servants abused by Kuwaiti nationals in the United States could be instructive (if not inordinately so) to a jury.

Burgess testified that her principal training and experience related to victims of sexual abuse, but that she had researched comparable clinical behavior manifested by victims of physical abuse of a non-sexual nature in so-called \"unequal power\" relationships (e.g., battered spouses and children).  Based on her general research and her personal interaction with hundreds of victims of sexual abuse, Burgess testified that Gedara's behavioral response to the non-sexual abuse administered by the Alzankis was consistent with the behavior of abuse victims generally.   It seems to us that expert testimony on this subject--which the defense was free to contradict--was \"reasonably likely\" to assist the jury in understanding and assessing the evidence, in that the matter at issue was highly material, somewhat technical, and beyond the realm of acquired knowledge normally possessed by lay jurors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant cites no federal case law for the contention that allowing an expert to testify to her empirical findings on the behavioral reactions of abuse victims impermissibly suggests to the jury that the putative victim's allegations of abuse should be believed.

See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112144\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Kozminski,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112144/united-states-v-kozminski/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">952</span></a></span>, 108 S.Ct. at 2765.   For example, the evidence relating to Kuwaiti customs and practices clearly tended to buttress the reasonableness of Gedara's stated belief in appellant's warnings that the American police, like their Kuwaiti counterparts, were under orders to shoot undocumented domestic workers who ventured out alone.  Gedara likewise would have been especially vulnerable to the coercive force of appellant's frequent threats to punish her disobedience by returning her to Kuwait, rather than to her native home in Sri Lanka.  Moreover, appellant's own familiarity with Kuwaiti customs could generate the reasonable inference that appellant played on Gedara's isolation and vulnerabilities, making it more probable that he acted with the requisite specific intent to subject her to involuntary servitude.  Indeed, appellant sought to capitalize on the very same evidence by arguing to the jury that he should not be convicted since his experiences growing up in Kuwait had never put him on fair notice that his treatment of Gedara might be considered criminal in other cultures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Hearsay Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant next challenges, as inadmissible hearsay, the testimony given by several nurses and a respiratory specialist who came to the Alzankis' apartment to care for their ailing child, and by a police officer who interviewed Gedara immediately after she fled the apartment.  These witnesses related various contemporaneous statements Gedara made to them concerning the harsh conditions and inhumane treatment she experienced at the hands of the Alzankis.  The government offered their testimony under Rule 801(d)(1)(B) (prior consistent statements offered to rebut charge of recent fabrication).  The district court admitted their testimony under Rule 803(3) (statements of declarant's then-existing state of mind).  We review for abuse of discretion.  United States v.

For example, as concerns appellant's second claim, the government responds that the restitutionary sentence did not include reimbursement to offset leave time Gedara took to help the government prepare its case, but merely to reimburse her for lost wages occasioned by having to leave her new employment to obtain treatment for the debilitating stress she experienced during her four-month ordeal.  The government concedes that reimbursement for Gedara's assistance in preparing for trial would be problematic as a matter of law, but appellant's failure to alert the district court to the claim, raised for the first time on appeal, prevented the sentencing court from clarifying the factual basis for its restitutionary sentence.  Lastly, appellant's only attempt at addressing the government's waiver argument--that he promptly appealed the restitutionary sentence--is no answer at all.  Nor did he request reconsideration of the restitutionary sentence.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c);  cf. United States v.

That's not enough.   The government does have to prove that he used ... or threatened physical or legal coercion.\"</p>\n        <p>Moreover, the preliminary jury instructions explained:  \"Now, involuntary servitude ... means a condition of servitude in which the victim is forced to work for the defendant by the use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury or by the use or threat of coercion through law or legal process.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Similarly, appellant suggests that the jury instruction invited the impression that \"extremely poor working conditions and/or special vulnerabilities of the servant\" might serve as a proxy for actual or threatened use of physical force or legal coercion.  However, the trial judge correctly instructed the jury that</p>\n        <p>[the charged offense, involuntary servitude,] encompasses situations in which one person holds another in servitude by placing that person in fear of such physical restraint or injury or legal coercion.  It may be shown by evidence of extremely poor working conditions and/or special vulnerabilities of the servant.</p>\n        <p>In addition, the jury received proper instructions on the roles of \"legal coercion\" and \"physical coercion\":</p>\n        <p>[Legal coercion] simply means the use of the law, the legal process, or legal institutions to compel service.  The question here that you will need to determine is:  Did the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used or threatened physical or legal coercion to compel Ms. Gedara's service in the household?</p>\n        <p>Of course, the jury is presumed to have followed the instructions.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195725\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Tutiven,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195725/united-states-v-tutiven/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">7</span> </a></span>(citing Yates v.

To a foreign worker familiar with Kuwaiti customs and practices (for example, at trial there was evidence that Kuwaiti soldiers manned checkpoints to enforce restrictions on noncitizen movement, especially household servants), a threat of deportation in these circumstances plausibly may equate with imprisonment.
