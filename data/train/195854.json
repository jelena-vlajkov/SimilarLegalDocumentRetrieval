Plaintiff Roberta Randall asserts that\r                      Per Curiam.\r                                \n\nthe   district  court   erroneously  ruled   that  statements\n\ncontained in two affidavits were inadmissible hearsay and, as\n\na  consequence  of that  ruling,  improperly granted  summary\n\njudgment for  defendants Scott  Paper Co. and  its subsidiary\n\nS.D. Warren  Co.1 on Randall's retaliation  claim under Title\n\nVII of  the  Civil Rights  Act  of 1964,  42  U.S.C.    2000-\n\ne(3)(a).   Because we conclude that even if the statements in\n\nquestion  were admissible  there  would still  be no  genuine\n\nissue of material fact, we affirm.\n\n          From   1980   to  1991,   Randall   worked  as   an\n\nenvironmental technician at Scott's mill in Westbrook, Maine.\n\nAfter she was laid off, either due to a mill-wide downsizing,\n\nas Scott claimed, or due to gender discrimination, as Randall\n\nclaimed,  Randall  filed a  complaint  with  the Maine  Human\n\nRights  Commission  (MHRC)  and  with  the  Equal  Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) in September 1991.   Meanwhile,\n\nRandall obtained  other employment,  working  first for  Betz\n\nIndustrial from  February 1991 until December  1991, when she\n\nwas  fired for  performance reasons,  and then  for Northeast\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Because it  is  not always  clear from  the record  which\nfacilities or  actions relevant to this  litigation are owned\nby  or  attributable  to  which defendant,  and  because  the\nparties treat  any such distinctions as  unimportant, we will\nhenceforth  refer  to either  or  both  defendants simply  as\n\"Scott,\" even if actual ownership of a particular facility or\nresponsibility for a particular  action in reality rests with\nS.D. Warren or with both defendants.\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nTest  Consultants  (NTC)  beginning  in August  1992.    Both\n\ncompanies provide environmental testing services to  Scott as\n\nwell as to other companies.  Randall's work for Betz included\n\nconsiderable time  spent at Scott's mill  in Hinckley, Maine.\n\nAlthough 15% of  NTC's business derived from  Scott, NTC sent\n\nRandall  to perform work at  Scott facilities on  only one or\n\ntwo occasions.  After both the MHRC and the EEOC declined  to\n\ntake action against Scott, Randall filed a sex discrimination\n\nlawsuit  against  Scott and  S.D. Warren  in  June 1993.   In\n\nJanuary 1994, one  day after  she was  deposed in  connection\n\nwith  her lawsuit, NTC laid  Randall off and  has not rehired\n\nher.\n\n          Randall's  allegation  relevant to  this  appeal is\n\nthat  Scott  retaliated  against  her for  pursuing  her  sex\n\ndiscrimination  claim,  thus  violating  42  U.S.C.     2000-\n\ne(3)(a),2  by  ordering NTC  to  keep  her  away  from  Scott\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  Section 2000-e(3)(a) provides in pertinent part:\n\n                    It  shall  be an  unlawful\n               employment   practice  for   an\n               employer     to    discriminate\n               against any of his employees or\n               applicants for employment . . .\n               because  he   has  opposed  any\n               practice   made   an   unlawful\n               employment  practice   by  this\n               subchapter,  or because  he has\n               made   a   charge,   testified,\n               assisted,  or  participated  in\n               any manner in an investigation,\n               proceeding,  or  hearing  under\n               this subchapter.\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nfacilities and, ultimately, to  dismiss her.3  The defendants\n\nmoved for summary judgment, asserting, inter alia, that there\r                                                             \n\nis  no genuine  issue of  material fact  because there  is no\n\nevidence linking Scott to  NTC's decision to dismiss Randall.\n\nIn  response to  the defendants'  motion, Randall  points to:\n\n(1)  the   temporal  proximity  of  her   dismissal  and  her\n\ndeposition  testimony;  (2)  the  importance of  Scott  as  a\n\ncustomer to  NTC, accounting  for approximately 15%  of NTC's\n\nbusiness;  (3) the fact that she was sent to Scott facilities\n\nonly  once or twice during  her sixteen months  at NTC; (4) a\n\ncontract between  NTC and Scott (the  \"Service Agreement\") in\n\nwhich Scott  retains the  right to  reject any  NTC employees\n\nsent to  perform work at Scott facilities;  (5) her favorable\n\nperformance evaluation  at NTC  relative to  another laid-off\n\nemployee  who  was subsequently  rehired; and  (6) statements\n\nallegedly   made  by  Randall's   supervisor  at  NTC,  James\n\nGuzelian, which Randall claims strongly support the inference\n\nthat Scott was behind her dismissal.\n\n          We  review a  grant  of summary  judgment de  novo,\r                                                                        \n\ndrawing all reasonable inferences  in favor of the nonmovant.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  Thus, Randall essentially claims that Scott \"blacklisted\"\nher  with NTC's  cooperation.   Scott does  not argue  that a\nblacklisting  claim  against   a  former   employer  is   not\nactionable  under  42  U.S.C.      2000e-3(a).    See,  e.g.,\r                                                                        \nRutherford v. American Bank of Commerce, 565 F.2d 1162, 1163-\r                                                   \n65 (10th Cir. 1977)  (holding that former employer's negative\nreference because of Title VII lawsuit constituted actionable\nretaliation under   2000e-3(a)).\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nLeBlanc v.  Great Am. Ins.  Co., 6  F.3d 836,  841 (1st  Cir.\r                                           \n\n1993), cert.  denied,  114  S.  Ct.  1398  (1994).    Summary\r                                \n\njudgment   is  appropriate   only   when  the   moving  party\n\ndemonstrates  that there  is  \"no  genuine  issue as  to  any\n\nmaterial  fact and  that the  moving party  is entitled  to a\n\njudgment as a matter of  law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P.  56(c).  When\n\nthe  nonmovant  bears  the  burden of  persuasion  at  trial,\n\nhowever, she can avoid summary  judgment against her only  if\n\nshe makes  a showing sufficient to establish the existence of\n\neach  essential  element  to  her  case.   Celotex  Corp.  v.\r                                                                     \n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986).  Thus, to get to trial,\r                   \n\nthe  burden-bearing nonmovant  must  adduce enough  competent\n\nevidence to  enable a reasonable jury to find for her on each\n\nelement essential to her claim.  See LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 842.\r                                                        \n\n          The  alleged Guzelian  statements are  contained in\n\ntwo  affidavits:  Randall's and that of Ann Peoples, a former\n\nScott  employee.  Randall states in her affidavit:  (1) About\n\na  month after she started working for NTC, Guzelian told her\n\nthat he had  heard about  her complaint  against Scott,  that\n\n\"someone\" in  Scott's purchasing department had  mentioned it\n\nto him but had told him that it should not be a problem.  (2)\n\nWhen Randall asked Guzelian when she  was going to be sent to\n\ndo  work at S.D. Warren  facilities, \"[h]e told  me that Rick\n\nLaCouture  (another NTC  employee)  had heard  that I  wasn't\n\nwelcome at  S.D. Warren, so he was  going to . .  . see if he\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\ncould find  out anything about  what Rick had said.\"   (3) On\n\nanother  occasion, Guzelian  told Randall  that \"he  had been\n\ntold\"  by  a  safety  supervisor at  a  Scott  facility  that\n\n\"someone  had  noticed\"  Randall's  name  and  that  \"someone\n\nthought that it  was o.k.\" for her  to work at  certain Scott\n\nfacilities  but  not  at  others  located  too  near  to  the\n\nWestbrook facility  where Randall had once  worked.  Guzelian\n\nalso asked Randall during  this conversation if she \"wouldn't\n\n. . . be better off just dropping\" her lawsuit against Scott.\n\n          In her affidavit, Peoples claims that in the course\n\nof a conversation with  Guzelian concerning her own prospects\n\nfor  employment at NTC, Guzelian told her that Randall \"had a\n\nproblem\" with  Scott \"because `we really can't  send her over\n\nthere' or words to that effect.\"\n\n          The  district  court  ruled  all   of  the  alleged\n\nGuzelian  statements4  inadmissible  hearsay.    Randall  now\n\nappeals, arguing that NTC was an agent of Scott, at least for\n\nthe   limited  purpose   of   retaliating  against   Randall.\n\nGuzelian's  statements  are  therefore   admissible,  Randall\n\nargues, under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D), which provides that\n\n\"a statement  by the  party's agent  or servant  concerning a\n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  In his  deposition, Guzelian denies that  anyone at Scott\nor S.D.  Warren ever exerted pressure to prevent Randall from\nworking  at its  facilities or  to force  NTC to  dismiss her\nentirely.    NTC  president  Steven  Broadhead  made  similar\ndenials  in his deposition.  In fact, Broadhead stated in his\ndeposition that Scott  had never invoked its right  under the\r                                            \nService Agreement to reject any NTC employees.\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nmatter within the scope  of the agency or employment\"  is not\n\nhearsay.  Proof of this principal-agent relationship, Randall\n\nasserts, is contained in a clause in the contract between NTC\n\nand  Scott that  grants Scott veto  power over  employees NTC\n\nwishes  to  send to  Scott  facilities,  and in  the  alleged\n\nGuzelian statements themselves.\n\n          We  need  not  resolve   the  question  of  whether\n\nRandall's agency  argument  propels the  Guzelian  statements\n\nover the  apparent hearsay and double-hearsay  hurdles.  Even\n\nif  the  Guzelian   statements  were  admissible,   Randall's\n\nproffered  assemblage of evidence would not get her to trial.\n\nA  rational factfinder  simply  could not  conclude from  the\n\nsummary  judgment  record  that  Randall  had  satisfied  her\n\nultimate burden of proving  that Scott retaliated against her\n\nbecause  of  her  lawsuit.5    Randall's  proffered  evidence\n\nimplicates Scott only by virtue of an inferential giant step.\n\nWhile Randall  perhaps has mustered  some evidence suggesting\n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.  We assume arguendo that Randall satisfied her prima facie\r                                  \nburden.  See Petitti v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 909 F.2d\r                                                               \n28,  33  (1st Cir.  1990).   Scott  has \"adopted\"  NTC's non-\ndiscriminatory   justifications   for  the   alleged  adverse\nemployment  actions -- that is,  the need to  send Randall to\nnon-Scott facilities  for training and the  unavailability of\nwork resulting  in her ultimate  layoff.  Once  the defendant\nhas  met  his  burden   of  production,  the  presumption  of\nretaliation  raised  by  the  plaintiff's  prima  facie  case\ndissolves, and  we simply look to the entire summary judgment\nrecord to assess  whether the plaintiff has  met her ultimate\nburden of proving that the defendant's  proffered reason is a\npretext  for retaliation.  See Mesnick  v. General Elec. Co.,\r                                                                        \n950 F.2d 816, 823  (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied,  112 S. Ct.\r                                                            \n2965 (1992).\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nthat NTC took action against her because she persisted in her\n\nlawsuit against Scott, an important NTC customer, she has not\n\noffered sufficient  evidence to enable  a rational factfinder\n\nto conclude that Scott  instructed NTC to keep her  away from\n\nits facilities or to lay her off because of her lawsuit.\n\n          Rather than  implicating Scott, the  first Guzelian\n\nstatement  contained  in Randall's  deposition  actually cuts\n\nagainst  her argument, since  it suggests  that Scott  had no\r                   \n\nproblem with her work for NTC.  The second and third Guzelian\n\nstatements  in  Randall's   affidavit  might  indicate   that\n\n\"someone\"  at Scott thought  that Randall should  not work at\n\ncertain Scott facilities for  unspecified reasons, but  there\n\nis  no   indication,  or  even  an   allegation,  that  these\r                                                           \n\nstatements came from anyone with the authority to bind Scott.\n\nSee Smith v. Stratus Computer, Inc., 40 F.3d 11, 18 (1st Cir.\r                                               \n\n1994)  (holding that plaintiff's  failure to  adduce evidence\n\nthat maker of statement made or influenced personnel decision\n\nrendered  comment  irrelevant   to  issue  of  discriminatory\n\nanimus).     The  inferential   leap  from  these   anonymous\n\nstatements to  the conclusion that someone  with authority at\n\nScott must have  ordered NTC  to keep her  away from  certain\n\nScott  facilities  and ultimately  fire  her --  or  that the\n\nmotivation   behind   these   \"orders\"   was   Randall's  sex\n\ndiscrimination lawsuit -- is far too great for any reasonable\n\nfactfinder to undertake.  The Guzelian statement contained in\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nPeoples'  affidavit  provides  Randall's  complaint  with  no\n\nadditional  sustenance; it, too, fails to link Scott to NTC's\n\ndecision to  lay her off,  suggesting only that  Guzelian was\r                                                                     \n\nuncomfortable sending Randall to Scott facilities.\n\n          Nor do any of the other factors that Randall points\n\nto  --  e.g., Scott's  importance to  NTC  as a  customer and\n\nScott's veto power under the Service Agreement -- bolster her\n\ncase sufficiently to get her to trial.  None of these factors\n\ncould possibly  support  a reasonable  inference  that  Scott\n\nretaliated against Randall and caused the adverse  employment\n\nactions she suffered  at NTC.   Thus, Randall  has failed  to\n\nadduce sufficient evidence  to meet her burden  at trial, and\n\nthe defendants are therefore entitled to judgment as a matter\n\nof law.\n\n          Affirmed.

Warren Co.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  on Randall's retaliation claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000-e(3)(a).  Because we conclude that even if the statements in question were admissible there would still be no genuine issue of material fact, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1980 to 1991, Randall worked as an environmental technician at Scott's mill in Westbrook, Maine.  After she was laid off, either due to a mill-wide downsizing, as Scott claimed, or due to gender discrimination, as Randall claimed, Randall filed a complaint with the Maine Human Rights Commission (MHRC) and with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in September 1991.  Meanwhile, Randall obtained other employment, working first for Betz Industrial from February 1991 until December 1991, when she was fired for performance reasons, and then for Northeast Test Consultants (NTC) beginning in August 1992.  Both companies provide environmental testing services to Scott as well as to other companies.  Randall's work for Betz included considerable time spent at Scott's mill in Hinckley, Maine.  Although 15% of NTC's business derived from Scott, NTC sent Randall to perform work at Scott facilities on only one or two occasions.  After both the MHRC and the EEOC declined to take action against Scott, Randall filed a sex discrimination lawsuit against Scott and S.D. Warren in June 1993.  In January 1994, one day after she was deposed in connection with her lawsuit, NTC laid Randall off and has not rehired her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Randall's allegation relevant to this appeal is that Scott retaliated against her for pursuing her sex discrimination claim, thus violating 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000-e(3)(a),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> by ordering NTC to keep her away from Scott facilities and, ultimately, to dismiss her.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The defendants moved for summary judgment, asserting, inter alia, that there is no genuine issue of material fact because there is no evidence linking Scott to NTC's decision to dismiss Randall.  In response to the defendants' motion, Randall points to:  (1) the temporal proximity of her dismissal and her deposition testimony;  (2) the importance of Scott as a customer to NTC, accounting for approximately 15% of NTC's business;  (3) the fact that she was sent to Scott facilities only once or twice during her sixteen months at NTC;  (4) a contract between NTC and Scott (the \"Service Agreement\") in which Scott retains the right to reject any NTC employees sent to perform work at Scott facilities; (5) her favorable performance evaluation at NTC relative to another laid-off employee who was subsequently rehired;  and (6) statements allegedly made by Randall's supervisor at NTC, James Guzelian, which Randall claims strongly support the inference that Scott was behind her dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant.  LeBlanc v. Great Am.  Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 841 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1398 (1994).  Summary judgment is appropriate only when the moving party demonstrates that there is \"no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  When the nonmovant bears the burden of persuasion at trial, however, she can avoid summary judgment against her only if she makes a showing sufficient to establish the existence of each essential element to her case.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986).  Thus, to get to trial, the burden-bearing nonmovant must adduce enough competent evidence to enable a reasonable jury to find for her on each element essential to her claim.  See LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 842.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The alleged Guzelian statements are contained in two affidavits:  Randall's and that of Ann Peoples, a former Scott employee.  Randall states in her affidavit:  (1) About a month after she started working for NTC, Guzelian told her that he had heard about her complaint against Scott, that \"someone\" in Scott's purchasing department had mentioned it to him but had told him that it should not be a problem.  (2) When Randall asked Guzelian when she was going to be sent to do work at S.D. Warren facilities, \"[h]e told me that Rick LaCouture (another NTC employee) had heard that I wasn't welcome at S.D. Warren, so he was going to ... see if he could find out anything about what Rick had said.\"  (3) On another occasion, Guzelian told Randall that \"he had been told\" by a safety supervisor at a Scott facility that \"someone had noticed\" Randall's name and that \"someone thought that it was o.k.\" for her to work at certain Scott facilities but not at others located too near to the Westbrook facility where Randall had once worked.  Guzelian also asked Randall during this conversation if she \"wouldn't ... be better off just dropping\" her lawsuit against Scott.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her affidavit, Peoples claims that in the course of a conversation with Guzelian concerning her own prospects for employment at NTC, Guzelian told her that Randall \"had a problem\" with Scott \"because 'we really can't send her over there' or words to that effect.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled all of the alleged Guzelian statements<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> inadmissible hearsay.  Randall now appeals, arguing that NTC was an agent of Scott, at least for the limited purpose of retaliating against Randall.  Guzelian's statements are therefore admissible, Randall argues, under Fed.  R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D), which provides that \"a statement by the party's agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment\" is not hearsay.  Proof of this principal- agent relationship, Randall asserts, is contained in a clause in the contract between NTC and Scott that grants Scott veto power over employees NTC wishes to send to Scott facilities, and in the alleged Guzelian statements themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve the question of whether Randall's agency argument propels the Guzelian statements over the apparent hearsay and double-hearsay hurdles.  Even if the Guzelian statements were admissible, Randall's proffered assemblage of evidence would not get her to trial.  A rational factfinder simply could not conclude from the summary judgment record that Randall had satisfied her ultimate burden of proving that Scott retaliated against her because of her lawsuit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Randall's proffered evidence implicates Scott only by virtue of an inferential giant step.  While Randall perhaps has mustered some evidence suggesting that NTC took action against her because she persisted in her lawsuit against Scott, an important NTC customer, she has not offered sufficient evidence to enable a rational factfinder to conclude that Scott instructed NTC to keep her away from its facilities or to lay her off because of her lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than implicating Scott, the first Guzelian statement contained in Randall's deposition actually cuts against her argument, since it suggests that Scott had no problem with her work for NTC. The second and third Guzelian statements in Randall's affidavit might indicate that \"someone\" at Scott thought that Randall should not work at certain Scott facilities for unspecified reasons, but there is no indication, or even an allegation, that these statements came from anyone with the authority to bind Scott.  See Smith v. Stratus Computer, Inc., 40 F.3d 11, 18 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that plaintiff's failure to adduce evidence that maker of statement made or influenced personnel decision rendered comment irrelevant to issue of discriminatory animus).  The inferential leap from these anonymous statements to the conclusion that someone with authority at Scott must have ordered NTC to keep her away from certain Scott facilities and ultimately fire her-or that the motivation behind these \"orders\" was Randall's sex discrimination lawsuit-is far too great for any reasonable factfinder to undertake.  The Guzelian statement contained in Peoples' affidavit provides Randall's complaint with no additional sustenance;  it, too, fails to link Scott to NTC's decision to lay her off, suggesting only that Guzelian was uncomfortable sending Randall to Scott facilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do any of the other factors that Randall points to-e.g., Scott's importance to NTC as a customer and Scott's veto power under the Service Agreement-bolster her case sufficiently to get her to trial.  None of these factors could possibly support a reasonable inference that Scott retaliated against Randall and caused the adverse employment actions she suffered at NTC. Thus, Randall has failed to adduce sufficient evidence to meet her burden at trial, and the defendants are therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

Warren or with both defendants</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Section 2000-e(3)(a) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment ... because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Thus, Randall essentially claims that Scott \"blacklisted\" her with NTC's cooperation.  Scott does not argue that a blacklisting claim against a former employer is not actionable under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-3(a).  See, e.g., Rutherford v. American Bank of Commerce, 565 F.2d 1162, 1163-65 (10th Cir. 1977) (holding that former employer's negative reference because of Title VII lawsuit constituted actionable retaliation under Sec. 2000e-3(a))</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In his deposition, Guzelian denies that anyone at Scott or S.D. Warren ever exerted pressure to prevent Randall from working at its facilities or to force NTC to dismiss her entirely.  NTC president Steven Broadhead made similar denials in his deposition.  In fact, Broadhead stated in his deposition that Scott had never invoked its right under the Service Agreement to reject any NTC employees</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We assume arguendo that Randall satisfied her prima facie burden.  See Petitti v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 909 F.2d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 1990).  Scott has \"adopted\" NTC's non- discriminatory justifications for the alleged adverse employment actions-that is, the need to send Randall to non-Scott facilities for training and the unavailability of work resulting in her ultimate layoff.  Once the defendant has met his burden of production, the presumption of retaliation raised by the plaintiff's prima facie case dissolves, and we simply look to the entire summary judgment record to assess whether the plaintiff has met her ultimate burden of proving that the defendant's proffered reason is a pretext for retaliation.  See Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 823 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 2965 (1992)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Warren or with both defendants</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Section 2000-e(3)(a) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment ... because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Thus, Randall essentially claims that Scott \"blacklisted\" her with NTC's cooperation.  Scott does not argue that a blacklisting claim against a former employer is not actionable under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-3(a).  See, e.g., Rutherford v. American Bank of Commerce, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"350736\"><a href=\"/opinion/350736/16-fair-emplpraccas-26-15-empl-prac-dec-p-7945-bertha-m-rutherford/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1162</span></a></span>, 1163-65 (10th Cir. 1977) (holding that former employer's negative reference because of Title VII lawsuit constituted actionable retaliation under Sec. 2000e-3(a))</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In his deposition, Guzelian denies that anyone at Scott or S.D. Warren ever exerted pressure to prevent Randall from working at its facilities or to force NTC to dismiss her entirely.  NTC president Steven Broadhead made similar denials in his deposition.  In fact, Broadhead stated in his deposition that Scott had never invoked its right under the Service Agreement to reject any NTC employees</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We assume arguendo that Randall satisfied her prima facie burden.  See Petitti v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545207\"><a href=\"/opinion/545207/54-fair-emplpraccas-142-54-empl-prac-dec-p-40108-robert-p-petitti/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir. 1990).  Scott has \"adopted\" NTC's non- discriminatory justifications for the alleged adverse employment actions-that is, the need to send Randall to non-Scott facilities for training and the unavailability of work resulting in her ultimate layoff.  Once the defendant has met his burden of production, the presumption of retaliation raised by the plaintiff's prima facie case dissolves, and we simply look to the entire summary judgment record to assess whether the plaintiff has met her ultimate burden of proving that the defendant's proffered reason is a pretext for retaliation.

Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 823 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
