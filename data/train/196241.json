Tompkins,  304 U.S.  64\r                                                          \r\n\n(1938), we decline  to do so and affirm the  grant of summary\r\n\njudgment issued in favor of Hawker  Dayton Corporation by the\r\n\ndistrict court. \r\n\n                            FACTS\r                                             \r\n\n          In  September  1991, the  appellant,  Randy Jordan,\r\n\nbadly injured  his hand at  work while attempting to  unjam a\r\n\ndoweling machine.  Jordan underwent medical and psychological\r\n\ntreatment,  and filed this  products liability action  in the\r\n\nUnited States District Court for Maine against \"Hawker Dayton\r\n\nManufacturing Company.\"\r\n\n          The doweling  machine was manufactured  in 1973  by\r\n\nHawker  Manufacturing  Company  (\"Hawker  Manufacturing\"),  a\r\n\ndivision of East Dayton Tool &amp; Die Co. (\"East Dayton\").  East\r\n\nDayton  also  manufactured  automobile  components and  other\r\n\nproducts.   Around  the time  that the  doweling machine  was\r\n\nmanufactured, Dorothy Darrow,  the sole  shareholder of  East\r\n\nDayton, sold  some of her  stock to family friends,  and East\r\n\nDayton  redeemed  her   remaining  stock  for  cash   and  an\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\ninstallment note.   The  company continued  its manufacturing\r\n\noperations and even added additional product lines.\r\n\n          In  August 1973, East Dayton sold to Harmon Darrow,\r\n\nthe  president of Hawker Manufacturing, an option to purchase\r\n\nthe  assets of Hawker Manufacturing at  their net book value.\r\n\nIn  March 1974, Mr.  Darrow formed Hawker  Dayton Corporation\r\n\n(\"Hawker Dayton\"), conveyed  his option to that  company, and\r\n\nin   July  1974,  Hawker  Dayton  exercised  the  option  and\r\n\npurchased the Hawker  Manufacturing assets for  approximately\r\n\n$150,000.  Hawker  Dayton continued the operations  of Hawker\r\n\nManufacturing and  continued to use  the Hawker Manufacturing\r\n\ntrade name.  East Dayton continued to manufacture woodworking\r\n\nmachines (including  doweling machines at  first), automobile\r\n\ndies and other specialized machinery for about two years.\r\n\n          In  1976, East Dayton defaulted  on its note to Ms.\r\n\nDarrow.  It then sold the  rest of its equipment for $925,000\r\n\nand its real property  for $650,000 to entities not  involved\r\n\nin this lawsuit, and made  payments out to Ms. Darrow  on the\r\n\ninstallment note for the next ten years.\r\n\n                      PROCEEDINGS BELOW\r                                                   \r\n\n          On  June  14, 1993,  Jordan  filed this  suit.   In\r\n\nAugust, the district court issued a scheduling order giving a\r\n\ndeadline   of  September  15,  1993,  for  amendment  of  the\r\n\npleadings.   The judge  later amended  the scheduling  order,\r\n\nextending the deadline for amending pleadings by fifteen days\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nand extending the  discovery deadline by two months.   During\r\n\ndiscovery, Jordan learned,  inter alia, that East  Dayton was\r                                                  \r\n\nthe manufacturer of  the doweling machine.   On February  10,\r\n\n1994, five  days before discovery  was to be  completed under\r\n\nthe scheduling order,  Jordan moved to correct  the corporate\r\n\nname  of the  defendant  from  \"Hawker  Dayton  Manufacturing\r\n\nCorporation\"  to \"Hawker  Dayton  Corporation,\"  to add  East\r\n\nDayton as a defendant  and to include additional theories  of\r\n\nliability  against Hawker Dayton.  The district court granted\r\n\nthe motion to correct the corporate name of the defendant and\r\n\nto add East  Dayton, but denied the motion  to add additional\r\n\ntheories of liability.\r\n\n          Jordan filed a  motion for summary judgment  on the\r\n\nissue  of whether  Hawker  Dayton was  liable as  a successor\r\n\ncorporation for  the debts  and liabilities  of East  Dayton.\r\n\nHawker  Dayton objected,  and  in  its  response  asked  that\r\n\nsummary  judgment  be  entered in  its  favor  instead.   The\r\n\nMagistrate Judge recommended that Jordan's motion be  denied,\r\n\nand the district  court adopted the recommendation.   Neither\r\n\nruled  on the  issue of  whether summary  judgment should  be\r\n\nentered   on  behalf  of   Hawker  Dayton.     Hawker  Dayton\r\n\nsubsequently  moved for  summary judgment,  and the  district\r\n\ncourt granted the motion.\r\n\n          Judgment  by  default  was   entered  against  East\r\n\nDayton, after a hearing on damages, for $2,230,088.21.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          Jordan  appeals the  grant of  summary judgment  in\r\n\nfavor of Hawker Dayton on the issue of successor liability.\r\n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          Four  years ago, albeit in a different context than\r\n\na tort suit, the Supreme Judicial  Court of Maine held, as to\r\n\ncorporate  successor   liability:     \"[A]bsent  a   contrary\r\n\nagreement  by the parties, or an explicit statutory provision\r\n\nin  derogation  of   the  established  common  law   rule,  a\r\n\ncorporation that purchases the assets  of another corporation\r\n\nin  a bona fide,  arm's-length transaction is  not liable for\r                           \r\n\nthe  debts or  liabilities  of the  transferor  corporation.\"\r\n\nDirector  of Bureau  of Labor  Standards  v. Diamond  Brands,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc., 588 A.2d 734, 736  (Me. 1991).  Diamond Brands involved\r                                                                \r\n\ninterpretation  of the  term \"employer\"  in  a severance  pay\r\n\nstatute.  Conceding  that there is  no contrary agreement  by\r\n\nthe  asset purchase  parties and  no  statutory exception  to\r\n\ncommon  law here,  Jordan tries  to avoid the  Diamond Brands\r                                                                         \r\n\nholding by arguing the  opinion does not foreshadow  what the\r\n\nMaine Court would do in a tort action. \r\n\n           There  are two  responses.   First,  the rule,  as\r\n\nstated above, that  a mere asset purchase will  not give rise\r\n\nto  successor liability  is  articulated  by Maine's  highest\r\n\ncourt as being \"the established common law rule.\"  That alone\r\n\ndefeats  Jordan's  claim, as  he  has argued  that  Maine law\r\n\napplies.   This common law  rule is reinforced by  the social\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\npolicy judgment made by the Maine legislature, in the statute\r\n\nat  issue in Diamond Brands.  Maine  there decided that it is\r                                       \r\n\nbenefited  by not discouraging  purchases of assets  of Maine\r\n\nbusinesses  through  imposition  of  successor  liability  on\r\n\npurchasing corporations, thus keeping businesses going  which\r\n\nwould otherwise  fail, and  so continuing  to have  employees\r\n\nbenefit  from their continued  employment.   Id. at  737 n.7.\r                                                            \r\n\nJordan  points  to  no  legal  developments  in  the  law  of\r\n\nsuccessor liability  in Maine  or in  any other  jurisdiction\r\n\nsince Diamond  Brands to  suggest that  the Supreme  Judicial\r                                 \r\n\nCourt would change this law.   See Bernhardt v. Polygraph Co.\r                                                                         \r\n\nof America, 350 U.S. 198,  205 (1956) (\"[T]here appears to be\r                      \r\n\nno confusion in the [Maine]  decisions, no developing line of\r\n\nauthorities that casts a shadow over the established ones, no\r\n\ndicta,  doubts  or  ambiguities in  the  opinions  of [Maine]\r\n\njudges  on  the  question,  no legislative  development  that\r\n\npromises  to undermine the  judicial rule.\").   Thus, Diamond\r                                                                         \r\n\nBrands is  the law of Maine,  and this Court  must apply that\r                  \r\n\nlaw.\r\n\n          Secondly, plaintiff  chose a federal, rather than a\r\n\nstate forum,  presumably cognizant of this  court's statement\r\n\nthat \"litigants  who reject a  state forum in order  to bring\r\n\nsuit  in  federal court  under diversity  jurisdiction cannot\r\n\nexpect  that new  trails  will  be blazed.\"    Ryan v.  Royal\r                                                                         \r\n\nInsurance  Company of America,  916 F.2d  731, 744  (1st Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n1990).   Jordan  did not  file  a motion  that  the issue  be\r\n\ncertified to  the state court.   Here Jordan has  suffered an\r\n\ninjury and East Dayton appears  to no longer have assets with\r\n\nwhich to satisfy his claim.  But the complex policy arguments\r\n\nas  to whether  the common  law should  strive to  assure him\r\n\nrecompense are left  to the state, not the  federal court, to\r\n\ndecide.   Here  Maine has  made that  calculus and  given the\r\n\ngreater weight  to the protection  of jobs through  limits on\r\n\nsuccessor  liability.   It is  not  the role  of the  federal\r\n\ncourts to \"question the policy choices of states whose law we\r\n\napply.\"   Krauss v. Manhattan  Life Insurance Company  of New\r                                                                         \r\n\nYork, 643 F.2d 98, 102 (2d Cir. 1981).\r                \r\n\n          Jordan  argues  that  the  Supreme  Judicial  Court\r\n\nrecently adopted a \"majority rule\" in another aspect  of tort\r\n\nlaw  and so  will adopt  the  majority rule  as to  successor\r\n\nliability.     Jordan  relies  on  Oceanside  at  Pine  Point\r                                                                         \r\n\nCondominium Owners Association v. Peachtree Doors,  Inc., 659\r                                                                    \r\n\nA.2d 267, 270 (Me. 1995), which held that a plaintiff did not\r\n\nstate a  claim in  tort for a  defective product's  damage to\r\n\nitself,  thus  having  Maine  join that  rule  adopted  by  a\r\n\nmajority  of jurisdictions.   Even were  we incorrect  in our\r\n\nunderstanding  that the law  of Maine on  successor liability\r\n\nhas been determined  by its highest authority,  this argument\r\n\nwould  not assist Jordan.   The Peachtree Doors decision does\r                                                           \r\n\nnot  expand plaintiffs' remedies, but reflects a rejection of\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nsuch an  expansion.   More tellingly, even  if Maine  were to\r\n\nadopt a  \"majority rule\"  as to  successor liability,  Jordan\r\n\nwould still  not prevail.   Assuming the majority rule  to be\r\n\nthat a corporation which purchases assets from another is not\r\n\nliable in tort  for the actions of the  transferor unless one\r\n\nof  four exceptions  is met,  see,  e.g., 1  American Law  of\r                                                                         \r\n\nProducts  Liability   7:1  at  10-11  (3d  ed.  1990),  those\r                               \r\n\nexceptions avail  Jordan naught.

There  was no\r\n\nagreement by Hawker Dayton, express or implied, to assume the\r\n\nliabilities of East Dayton Tool  and Die Co., and Jordan does\r\n\nnot claim  that the  asset sale was  fraudulent, not  made in\r\n\ngood  faith, or made without sufficient consideration.  There\r\n\nwas  no  de facto  merger  nor  a  mere continuation  of  the\r\n\npredecessor  here  where  the  transferor  corporation,  East\r\n\nDayton,  neither  dissolved nor  liquidated  after the  asset\r\n\nsale.   See,  e.g.,  1 American  Law  of Products  Liability,\r                                                                        \r\n\nsupra,      7:10,   7:12,  7:14  &amp;   7:15  (both  merger   or\r                 \r\n\nconsolidation and  mere continuation exceptions  require that\r\n\nthere be only one corporation at the end of the transaction).\r\n\nIndeed East Dayton sold less than 10% of its assets to Hawker\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nDayton, continued to  do business thereafter and paid  out on\r\n\nan installment note for twelve years after the asset sale.\r\n\n          Jordan's argument ultimately  is that the  \"product\r\n\nline\"  doctrine of  successor  liability should  be  adopted.\r\n\nUnder the product line doctrine, a corporation that purchases\r\n\nall  or   substantially  all   of  the   assets  of   another\r\n\ncorporation, continues the manufacturing operations and sells\r\n\nthe  same product  line may  be strictly liable  for injuries\r\n\ncaused  by defective  products in  that line.   See,  e.g., 1\r                                                                      \r\n\nAmerican Law of Products Liability,  supra,   7:25 at 42; see\r                                                                         \r\n\nalso Ray, 19 Cal.3d 22, 560 P.2d 3; Ramirez, 86 N.J. 332, 431\r                                                       \r\n\nA.2d 811 (1981); Dawejko v.

It is\r                        \r\n\nfar from clear the product line doctrine would assist Jordan.\r\n\nSee, e.g.,  Ray, 19 Cal.3d at 31; 560  P.2d at 9; Ramirez, 86\r                                                                     \r\n\nN.J.  at 358,  431 A.2d  at 825  (the product  line exception\r\n\nrequires  that the  asset  purchase destroy  the  plaintiff's\r\n\nremedy,  for example, because all of the assets are purchased\r\n\nor because the purchase agreement requires the predecessor to\r\n\nliquidate).  This  doctrine is at most a  minority rule which\r\n\nhas plainly not been adopted by Maine.\r\n\n          Finally, Jordan  makes a  procedural argument  that\r\n\nthe  court was precluded  from entering summary  judgment for\r\n\nHawker Dayton because  it failed to do so  when Hawker Dayton\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nhad  countered his  motion in  part  by saying  that it,  not\r\n\nJordan,  was  entitled  to  entry of  judgment.    The  court\r\n\noriginally  denied  Jordan's  motion and  took  no  action on\r\n\nHawker  Dayton's counter request.   When Hawker  Dayton later\r\n\nfiled a formal motion for  summary judgment in its favor, the\r\n\ncourt granted it, saying it  had not considered the merits of\r\n\nHawker  Dayton's  request  when it  denied  Jordan's  motion.\r\n\nThere was no error in this procedure and would have been none\r\n\neven  if  the court  had considered  the counter  request the\r\n\nfirst time around.   See Burns v. Massachusetts  Institute of\r                                                                         \r\n\nTechnology, 394 F.2d 416, 418 (1st Cir. 1968).  Nor was there\r                      \r\n\nan abuse of  discretion in denying  Jordan's motion to  amend\r\n\nhis complaint filed more than  four months after the deadline\r\n\nset  in the  scheduling  order  and only  a  few days  before\r\n\ndiscovery was to be completed.\r\n\n          The decision of the district court granting summary\r\n\njudgment to Hawker Dayton is affirmed.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n",

Jordan underwent medical and psychological\r\n\ntreatment,  and filed this  products liability action  in the\r\n\nUnited States District Court for Maine against \"Hawker Dayton\r\n\nManufacturing Company.\"\r\n\n          The doweling  machine was manufactured  in 1973  by\r\n\nHawker  Manufacturing  Company  (\"Hawker  Manufacturing\"),  a\r\n\ndivision of East Dayton Tool &amp; Die Co. (\"East Dayton\").  East\r\n\nDayton  also  manufactured  automobile  components and  other\r\n\nproducts.   Around  the time  that the  doweling machine  was\r\n\nmanufactured, Dorothy Darrow,  the sole  shareholder of  East\r\n\nDayton, sold  some of her  stock to family friends,  and East\r\n\nDayton  redeemed  her   remaining  stock  for  cash   and  an\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\ninstallment note.   The  company continued  its manufacturing\r\n\noperations and even added additional product lines.\r\n\n          In  August 1973, East Dayton sold to Harmon Darrow,\r\n\nthe  president of Hawker Manufacturing, an option to purchase\r\n\nthe  assets of Hawker Manufacturing at  their net book value.\r\n\nIn  March 1974, Mr.  Darrow formed Hawker  Dayton Corporation\r\n\n(\"Hawker Dayton\"), conveyed  his option to that  company, and\r\n\nin   July  1974,  Hawker  Dayton  exercised  the  option  and\r\n\npurchased the Hawker  Manufacturing assets for  approximately\r\n\n$150,000.  Hawker  Dayton continued the operations  of Hawker\r\n\nManufacturing and  continued to use  the Hawker Manufacturing\r\n\ntrade name.  East Dayton continued to manufacture woodworking\r\n\nmachines (including  doweling machines at  first), automobile\r\n\ndies and other specialized machinery for about two years.\r\n\n          In  1976, East Dayton defaulted  on its note to Ms.\r\n\nDarrow.  It then sold the  rest of its equipment for $925,000\r\n\nand its real property  for $650,000 to entities not  involved\r\n\nin this lawsuit, and made  payments out to Ms. Darrow  on the\r\n\ninstallment note for the next ten years.\r\n\n                      PROCEEDINGS BELOW\r                                                   \r\n\n          On  June  14, 1993,  Jordan  filed this  suit.   In\r\n\nAugust, the district court issued a scheduling order giving a\r\n\ndeadline   of  September  15,  1993,  for  amendment  of  the\r\n\npleadings.   The judge  later amended  the scheduling  order,\r\n\nextending the deadline for amending pleadings by fifteen days\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nand extending the  discovery deadline by two months.   During\r\n\ndiscovery, Jordan learned,  inter alia, that East  Dayton was\r                                                  \r\n\nthe manufacturer of  the doweling machine.   On February  10,\r\n\n1994, five  days before discovery  was to be  completed under\r\n\nthe scheduling order,  Jordan moved to correct  the corporate\r\n\nname  of the  defendant  from  \"Hawker  Dayton  Manufacturing\r\n\nCorporation\"  to \"Hawker  Dayton  Corporation,\"  to add  East\r\n\nDayton as a defendant  and to include additional theories  of\r\n\nliability  against Hawker Dayton.  The district court granted\r\n\nthe motion to correct the corporate name of the defendant and\r\n\nto add East  Dayton, but denied the motion  to add additional\r\n\ntheories of liability.\r\n\n          Jordan filed a  motion for summary judgment  on the\r\n\nissue  of whether  Hawker  Dayton was  liable as  a successor\r\n\ncorporation for  the debts  and liabilities  of East  Dayton.\r\n\nHawker  Dayton objected,  and  in  its  response  asked  that\r\n\nsummary  judgment  be  entered in  its  favor  instead.   The\r\n\nMagistrate Judge recommended that Jordan's motion be  denied,\r\n\nand the district  court adopted the recommendation.   Neither\r\n\nruled  on the  issue of  whether summary  judgment should  be\r\n\nentered   on  behalf  of   Hawker  Dayton.     Hawker  Dayton\r\n\nsubsequently  moved for  summary judgment,  and the  district\r\n\ncourt granted the motion.\r\n\n          Judgment  by  default  was   entered  against  East\r\n\nDayton, after a hearing on damages, for $2,230,088.21.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          Jordan  appeals the  grant of  summary judgment  in\r\n\nfavor of Hawker Dayton on the issue of successor liability.\r\n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          Four  years ago, albeit in a different context than\r\n\na tort suit, the Supreme Judicial  Court of Maine held, as to\r\n\ncorporate  successor   liability:     \"[A]bsent  a   contrary\r\n\nagreement  by the parties, or an explicit statutory provision\r\n\nin  derogation  of   the  established  common  law   rule,  a\r\n\ncorporation that purchases the assets  of another corporation\r\n\nin  a bona fide,  arm's-length transaction is  not liable for\r                           \r\n\nthe  debts or  liabilities  of the  transferor  corporation.\"\r\n\nDirector  of Bureau  of Labor  Standards  v.

Diamond Brands involved\r                                                                \r\n\ninterpretation  of the  term \"employer\"  in  a severance  pay\r\n\nstatute.  Conceding  that there is  no contrary agreement  by\r\n\nthe  asset purchase  parties and  no  statutory exception  to\r\n\ncommon  law here,  Jordan tries  to avoid the  Diamond Brands\r                                                                         \r\n\nholding by arguing the  opinion does not foreshadow  what the\r\n\nMaine Court would do in a tort action. \r\n\n           There  are two  responses.   First,  the rule,  as\r\n\nstated above, that  a mere asset purchase will  not give rise\r\n\nto  successor liability  is  articulated  by Maine's  highest\r\n\ncourt as being \"the established common law rule.\"  That alone\r\n\ndefeats  Jordan's  claim, as  he  has argued  that  Maine law\r\n\napplies.   This common law  rule is reinforced by  the social\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\npolicy judgment made by the Maine legislature, in the statute\r\n\nat  issue in Diamond Brands.  Maine  there decided that it is\r                                       \r\n\nbenefited  by not discouraging  purchases of assets  of Maine\r\n\nbusinesses  through  imposition  of  successor  liability  on\r\n\npurchasing corporations, thus keeping businesses going  which\r\n\nwould otherwise  fail, and  so continuing  to have  employees\r\n\nbenefit  from their continued  employment.   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at  737 </span><pre class=\"inline\">n.7.\r                                                            \r\n\nJordan  points  to  no  legal  developments  in  the  law  of\r\n\nsuccessor liability  in Maine  or in  any other  jurisdiction\r\n\nsince Diamond  Brands to  suggest that  the Supreme  Judicial\r                                 \r\n\nCourt would change this law.

Even were  we incorrect  in our\r\n\nunderstanding  that the law  of Maine on  successor liability\r\n\nhas been determined  by its highest authority,  this argument\r\n\nwould  not assist Jordan.   The Peachtree Doors decision does\r                                                           \r\n\nnot  expand plaintiffs' remedies, but reflects a rejection of\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nsuch an  expansion.   More tellingly, even  if Maine  were to\r\n\nadopt a  \"majority rule\"  as to  successor liability,  Jordan\r\n\nwould still  not prevail.
