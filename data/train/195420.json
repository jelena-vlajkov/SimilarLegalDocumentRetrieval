Following  execution   of  a  settlement\n                \n\nagreement in this Title  VII suit, plaintiff Edward Gallagher\n\nsought  to disavow the agreement on the ground that his trial\n\nattorney had  lacked authorization to settle the  suit on the\n\nagreed terms.  After  conducting a status conference attended\n\nby plaintiff  and counsel,  the district court  rejected this\n\nclaim,  finding that  plaintiff's  attorney  \"had the  proper\n\nauthority  to  settle  his  case.\"   Plaintiff  now  seeks to\n\nchallenge this determination.   He voices no complaint as  to\n\nthe format of the conference and,  indeed, it readily appears\n\nthat  he was afforded \"a  fair opportunity to  have his say.\"\n\nMichaud v. Michaud, 932 F.2d 77, 81 (1st Cir. 1991).  Rather,\n                  \n\nhis cursory argument on appeal appears to be that the court's\n\nfinding was clearly erroneous.\n\n     We are unable meaningfully to evaluate this claim on the\n\nbasis  of the record presented.  If the status conference was\n\nrecorded, plaintiff was obligated under Fed. R. App. P. 10(b)\n\n&amp; 11(a) to order  a transcript.  See, e.g.,  Valedon Martinez\n                                                             \n\nv.

Alternatively, if the  conference was\n\nnot recorded,  plaintiff could have prepared  a \"statement of\n\nthe evidence\" under Fed. R. App. P. 10(c) for approval by the\n\n                             -2-\n\ndistrict  court.   See, e.g.,  Barilaro v.
