After thoroughly  reviewing the record on appeal,  we\n\naffirm the district court's order allowing the fees and expenses.\naffirm\n\n                                I.\n\n                            Background\n                                      \n\n          We  briefly  outline   the  dispositive   facts.     DN\n\nAssociates,  a limited partnership  organized in Maine, purchased\n\nthe Atlantic Motor Inn immediately before the severe real-estate-\n\nvalue plunge in  New England,  and ended up  filing a Chapter  11\n\nbankruptcy petition on April 19, 1991.  DN Associates' attempt at\n\nChapter  11   reorganization  came   on  the  heels   of  Casco's\n\ncommencement  of an  action in  state court  to foreclose  on its\n\nmortgage of  the  Atlantic Motor  Inn  property.   DN  Associates\n\nwanted to  reorganize itself and  avoid losing the  investment of\n\nits limited partners by turning its investment into a  profitable\n\nventure under the protection of  the bankruptcy laws.  Throughout\n\nthe ensuing bankruptcy proceedings, DN Associates was represented\n\nby James D. Poliquin, of the law firm of Norman,  Hanson &amp; DeTroy\n\n(\"debtor's counsel\" or \"DN's counsel\").  \n\n          On  August  19,  1991,  DN  Associates,  as  debtor  in\n\npossession, filed its first proposed reorganization  plan; Casco,\n\na  secured creditor and lender of last resort, objected and moved\n\n                               -2-\n                                2\n\nfor an appointment of  a trustee or,  in the alternative, to  end\n\ndebtor's period of exclusivity for proposing a resolution.  Casco\n\nindicated  it would present a plan that provided for 100% payment\n\nto unsecured creditors.   On September  13, 1991, the  bankruptcy\n\ncourt terminated  DN Associates' exclusivity  under the rationale\n\nthat the  plans offered by  DN Associates and  by Casco  would be\n\nbest considered  simultaneously.   DN Associates filed  its first\n\namended plan on  October 5,  1991, and Casco  filed its  proposed\n\nfinancial  plan on November 25,  1991.  Both  plans provided 100%\n\npayment to unsecured creditors, but DN Associates' proposal would\n\nhave retained  the interests  of the  limited partners  through a\n\nrecapitalization proposal.  Casco's plan differed in that  it did\n\nnot  retain the  interests of  the limited  partners and  did not\n\nattempt to salvage DN  Associates' business operation.  Following\n\nCasco's filing, DN Associates  proceeded to offer three different\n\namended plans as alternatives to Casco's proposed financial plan.\n\n          On April  17, 1992,  the bankruptcy court  confirmed an\n\namended version of the plan  proposed by Casco, thereby rejecting\n\nDN  Associates'  various   reorganization  alternatives.     Soon\n\nthereafter,  DN's  counsel filed  an  additional fee  application\n\nseeking approval  of $62,898.65 in  fees of  attorneys and  other\n\nprofessionals incurred  between September  3, 1991 and  April 17,\n\n1992.1  In  the bankruptcy court, Casco objected  to both the fee\n\naward  and  the  subsequent application  and  sought  not  only a\n\n                    \n\n     1Debtor's counsel  had already been  compensated for $35,000\nin fees and expenses incurred before September 3, 1991.\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\ndisallowance of the final  fee award, but  also a return of  fees\n\npreviously awarded.  The  rationale behind Casco's opposition was\n\nits  understanding  that  the  debtor's continued  opposition  to\n\nCasco's  perfectly-reasonable plan and  the repeated proposing of\n\nalternative plans by debtor's counsel to save the interest of the\n\nlimited  partners was adverse to the  estate.  On the other hand,\n\ndebtor's counsel insisted that his efforts were beneficial to the\n\nestate  and expected  to be  compensated for  his efforts  by the\n\nbankruptcy  court.    The  record indicates  that  at  least  one\n\npartially-secured creditor, GIAC, represented by Attorney Fred W.\n\nBopp, agreed  in the bankruptcy proceedings  that the persistence\n\nof  DN's  counsel  in   offering  alternatives  to  Casco's  plan\n\npositively affected the final resolution of the dispute.\n\n          On  August  20,  1992, the  bankruptcy  court overruled\n\nCasco's objections and awarded  the requested amount of fees  and\n\nexpenses  to DN's counsel and  to the other  professionals.  Five\n\ndays later, Casco appealed the bankruptcy court's decision to the\n\ndistrict  court, arguing that  DN's counsel represented interests\n\nadverse to the estate,  and that such rendered services  were not\n\nnecessary  and did not benefit the estate as required by statute.\n\nOn March  10, 1993, the  district court  affirmed the  bankruptcy\n\ncourt,  finding  that the  bankruptcy  judge had  not  abused his\n\ndiscretion or erred in applying the law.  \n\n          Casco  now appeals  the district  court's order  on the\n\nfollowing  four issues:   First, whether as  a matter  of law the\n\ndistrict  court erred in its  choice of the  relevant standard of\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\nreview;  second,  whether as  a matter  of  law the  lower courts\n\napplied the  wrong standard in ascertaining  whether DN's counsel\n\nand  other professionals  performed \"actual,  necessary services\"\n\nresulting in benefit to  the bankruptcy estate under 11  U.S.C.  \n\n330(a); third, whether as a matter  of law the lower courts erred\n\nby  applying  the  incorrect  standard for  determining  if  DN's\n\ncounsel represented an interest adverse to the estate with regard\n\nto the prohibitions detailed  at 11 U.S.C.   328(c);  and fourth,\n\nin  the  alternative,  whether  the  district  court  abused  its\n\ndiscretion   in   determining  that   DN's   counsel   and  other\n\nprofessionals performed \"actual, necessary services\" resulting in\n\nbenefit to the estate as required by 11 U.S.C.   330(a).\n\n                               II.\n\n               Relevant Bankruptcy Code Provisions\n                                                  \n\n          Section 323  (a) of the  Bankruptcy Code states  that a\n\ntrustee  is the  fiduciary  of a  bankrupt  estate, 11  U.S.C.   \n\n323(a),  and  11  U.S.C.    1107(a)  provides  that  a debtor  in\n\npossession  has   similar  rights   and  powers  as   a  trustee.\n\nBankruptcy  courts  are  given  the  discretionary  authority  to\n\ncompensate professionals  employed under  11 U.S.C.    327  by an\n\nestate  trustee or  debtor in  possession for  \"actual, necessary\n\nservices\"  from   estate  assets   and  to   similarly  reimburse\n\nprofessionals  for \"actual,  necessary  expenses.\"   11 U.S.C.   \n\n330(a)(1) - (2); see  also 11 U.S.C.   331  (interim compensation\n                          \n\nby application of professional).

However,  courts may grant attorney's  fees even if a\n\nconflict of interest is demonstrated, as long as such an award is\n\nsensible  in  light of  the circumstances.

After  all, it  is\n                           \n\nsettled  that  an  appellate  court, confronted  by  a  difficult\n\njurisdictional  or quasi-jurisdictional  question, may  forgo its\n\nresolution   if  the  merits   of  the   appeal  are,   as  here,\n\nstraightforward and  easily resolved  in favor  of  the party  or\n\nparties  to whose  benefit  the objection  to jurisdiction  would\n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\nredound.

We find  this\n\nargument  to  be  without merit.    A  district  court reviews  a\n\nbankruptcy court's judgment in the same manner in which we review\n\nlower court  proceedings.  \"Findings of  fact . . .  shall not be\n\nset  aside unless clearly  erroneous .  . . .  \"  Fed.

Casco also argues\n\nthat the  bankruptcy  court erred  in its  finding that  debtor's\n\ncounsel's work actually benefitted the estate.\n\n          The thrust of Casco's argument is that the perseverance\n\nof  DN's  counsel  in  submitting  revised  reorganization plans,\n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\nfollowing  the proposal  of Casco's plan,  created no  benefit to\n\ncreditors   and   demonstrated   that  DN's   counsel   was   not\n\ndisinterested, since it  sought to preserve investors'  interests\n\nat  the expense of the estate.   The district court held that the\n\nbankruptcy court's August 20, 1992 decision adequately  explained\n\nthe reasoning for full payment of fees to DN's  counsel and other\n\nprofessionals.    We  agree  with  both the  bankruptcy  and  the\n\ndistrict  court's assessment on this issue.  DN's counsel's plans\n\nprovided 100%  payment to  unsecured creditors just  like Casco's\n\nproposal; thus, the fact  that DN's counsel's proposals attempted\n\nto maintain the  viability of investments made  by DN Associates'\n\nlimited  partners and also the integrity  of the overall business\n\noperation does  not signify  that DN's  counsel failed to  remain\n\ndisinterested or held  an adverse  interest to the  estate.   The\n\nbankruptcy  court concluded  in its  factual findings  that \"DN's\n\ncourse was consistent  with its  fiduciary duties to  all of  the\n\nestate's  constituencies.\"   In re  DN Associates,  No. 91-20417,\n                                                 \n\nslip op.  at 10 (Bankr.D.Me. Aug.  20, 1992).  We  agree with the\n\nbankruptcy court that \n\n          [i]t would be unfortunate if  courts, looking\n          only at plan provisions removed from context,\n          concluded as a matter  of law that a conflict\n          of interest existed whenever a debtor and its\n          counsel,  in the face of creditor opposition,\n          pursued a reorganization strategy that, while\n          providing   for   creditors   in  a   fashion\n          consistent with Chapter 11 priorities, sought\n          to  adjust   the  rights  and   relations  of\n          parties-in-interest so that the  interests of\n          equity interest holders could be preserved.\n\n                               -10-\n                                10\n\nId.   at  12-13  (cited  in  Casco  Northern  Bank,  N.A.  v.

The  bankruptcy  court was  in the  best\n\nposition  to  observe  and  analyze DN's  counsel's  actions  and\n\nproposals, and that court found that \"DN's plan sought to achieve\n\nnone  of  [its]  results by  denying  creditors  their  due.   DN\n\nproposed that  unsecured creditors be paid in  full shortly after\n\nconfirmation; that  Casco retain its  collateral and be  paid its\n\nsecured claim; and that administrative claims be fully paid.\"  In\n                                                                 \n\nre  DN Associates, No. 91-20417, slip op. at 10 (Bankr.D.Me.

We find nothing in  the record that would lead us to\n\nconclude that the bankruptcy court erred or abused its discretion\n\nin  arriving at its legal determination that DN's counsel was not\n\nacting  adversely to the estate.   As a matter of law, therefore,\n\nwe affirm what both  the bankruptcy court and the  district court\n\ndecided, that DN's counsel was a disinterested person and held no\n\nadverse interest to the estate.\n\n          Both  before  the  district  court  and  the  court  of\n\nappeals,  Casco has  argued that  the bankruptcy  court  erred in\n\nfinding that DN's counsel's actions, following Casco's submission\n\nof a viable plan, constituted a  benefit to the estate.  We, like\n\nthe  district  court,  have  interpreted  the bankruptcy  court's\n\nlengthy  discussion of  interest  and disinterest  to address  --\n\n                               -11-\n                                11\n\nimplicitly  if  not  explicitly  --  the  benefit  issue.     The\n\nbankruptcy  court  enumerated  several  arguably  intangible, but\n\nnevertheless  real, benefits  to the  estate from  DN's counsel's\n\nproposals:    The  plans  attempted  to  protect  all  interested\n\nparties, including creditors and debtor's investors, see In re DN\n                                                                 \n\nAssociates, No. 91-20417, slip op. at 10-13 (Bankr.D.Me. Aug. 20,\n          \n\n1992);  DN's counsel's  \"persistent\" actions  \"spurred\"  Casco to\n\ndevelop its own plan -- the reorganization eventually approved by\n\nthe bankruptcy court, see  id. at 20; and the  resulting zealous,\n                              \n\nbut reasonable, competition between  plans and their drafters was\n\nconstructive.   See id.   Moreover, as already  advanced, counsel\n                       \n\nfor one of the  partially-secured creditors, GIAC, testified that\n\nthe  efforts of  DN's  counsel prompted  a  benefit in  that  the\n\npressure  of DN  Associates' proposals  created an  atmosphere of\n\nconstructive  competition  up  until  the  \"eleventh  hour\"  that\n\nimproved Casco's final  amended plan.     The bankruptcy  court's\n\ndeterminations regarding benefit were highly  fact-intensive, and\n\nthere  is no  evidence in the  record that such  findings of fact\n\nwere clearly erroneous.   We cannot  disturb both the  bankruptcy\n\nand  district courts' decisions finding  as a matter  of fact and\n\nlaw  that the work performed by DN's counsel between September 3,\n\n1991 and April 17, 1992 provided a benefit to the estate.\n\n                                V.\n\n                           Conclusion  \n                           Conclusion\n                                     \n\n          The relevant findings of fact with  respect to both the\n\nissue  of  adverse interest  and benefit  to  the estate  are not\n\n                               -12-\n                                12\n\nclearly erroneous.

After thoroughly reviewing the record on appeal, we affirm the district court's order allowing the fees and expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly outline the dispositive facts.  DN Associates, a limited partnership organized in Maine, purchased the Atlantic Motor Inn immediately before the severe real-estate-value plunge in New England, and ended up filing a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on April 19, 1991.  DN Associates' attempt at Chapter 11 reorganization came on the heels of Casco's commencement of an action in state court to foreclose on its mortgage of the Atlantic Motor Inn property.  DN Associates wanted to reorganize itself and avoid losing the investment of its limited partners by turning its investment into a profitable venture under the protection of the bankruptcy laws.  Throughout the ensuing bankruptcy proceedings, DN Associates was represented by James D. Poliquin, of the law firm of Norman, Hanson &amp; DeTroy (\"debtor's counsel\" or \"DN's counsel\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 19, 1991, DN Associates, as debtor in possession, filed its first proposed reorganization plan;  Casco, a secured creditor and lender of last resort, objected and moved for an appointment of a trustee or, in the alternative, to end debtor's period of exclusivity for proposing a resolution.  Casco indicated it would present a plan that provided for 100% payment to unsecured creditors.  On September 13, 1991, the bankruptcy court terminated DN Associates' exclusivity under the rationale that the plans offered by DN Associates and by Casco would be best considered simultaneously.  DN Associates filed its first amended plan on October 5, 1991, and Casco filed its proposed financial plan on November 25, 1991.  Both plans provided 100% payment to unsecured creditors, but DN Associates' proposal would have retained the interests of the limited partners through a recapitalization proposal.  Casco's plan differed in that it did not retain the interests of the limited partners and did not attempt to salvage DN Associates' business operation.  Following Casco's filing, DN Associates proceeded to offer three different amended plans as alternatives to Casco's proposed financial plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 17, 1992, the bankruptcy court confirmed an amended version of the plan proposed by Casco, thereby rejecting DN Associates' various reorganization alternatives.  Soon thereafter, DN's counsel filed an additional fee application seeking approval of $62,898.65 in fees of attorneys and other professionals incurred between September 3, 1991 and April 17, 1992.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In the bankruptcy court, Casco objected to both the fee award and the subsequent application and sought not only a disallowance of the final fee award, but also a return of fees previously awarded.  The rationale behind Casco's opposition was its understanding that the debtor's continued opposition to Casco's perfectly-reasonable plan and the repeated proposing of alternative plans by debtor's counsel to save the interest of the limited partners was adverse to the estate.  On the other hand, debtor's counsel insisted that his efforts were beneficial to the estate and expected to be compensated for his efforts by the bankruptcy court.  The record indicates that at least one partially-secured creditor, GIAC, represented by Attorney Fred W. Bopp, agreed in the bankruptcy proceedings that the persistence of DN's counsel in offering alternatives to Casco's plan positively affected the final resolution of the dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 20, 1992, the bankruptcy court overruled Casco's objections and awarded the requested amount of fees and expenses to DN's counsel and to the other professionals.  Five days later, Casco appealed the bankruptcy court's decision to the district court, arguing that DN's counsel represented interests adverse to the estate, and that such rendered services were not necessary and did not benefit the estate as required by statute.  On March 10, 1993, the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court, finding that the bankruptcy judge had not abused his discretion or erred in applying the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casco now appeals the district court's order on the following four issues:  First, whether as a matter of law the district court erred in its choice of the relevant standard of review;  second, whether as a matter of law the lower courts applied the wrong standard in ascertaining whether DN's counsel and other professionals performed \"actual, necessary services\" resulting in benefit to the bankruptcy estate under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 330(a);  third, whether as a matter of law the lower courts erred by applying the incorrect standard for determining if DN's counsel represented an interest adverse to the estate with regard to the prohibitions detailed at 11 U.S.C. Sec. 328(c);  and fourth, in the alternative, whether the district court abused its discretion in determining that DN's counsel and other professionals performed \"actual, necessary services\" resulting in benefit to the estate as required by 11 U.S.C. Sec. 330(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Relevant Bankruptcy Code Provisions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 323(a) of the Bankruptcy Code states that a trustee is the fiduciary of a bankrupt estate, 11 U.S.C. Sec. 323(a), and 11 U.S.C. Sec. 1107(a) provides that a debtor in possession has similar rights and powers as a trustee.  Bankruptcy courts are given the discretionary authority to compensate professionals employed under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 327 by an estate trustee or debtor in possession for \"actual, necessary services\" from estate assets and to similarly reimburse professionals for \"actual, necessary expenses.\"  11 U.S.C. Sec. 330(a)(1)-(2);  see also 11 U.S.C. Sec. 331 (interim compensation by application of professional).  By the same token, bankruptcy courts must limit or deny such remuneration if the professionals at issue are found not to be \"disinterested\" persons<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> or if their work does not \"benefit\" the estate or creditors.  11 U.S.C. Sec. 328(c).  However, courts may grant attorney's fees even if a conflict of interest is demonstrated, as long as such an award is sensible in light of the circumstances.

We do not reach the question of Casco's appellate standing raised sua sponte by this court.  After all, it is settled that an appellate court, confronted by a difficult jurisdictional or quasi-jurisdictional question, may forgo its resolution if the merits of the appeal are, as here, straightforward and easily resolved in favor of the party or parties to whose benefit the objection to jurisdiction would redound.  SeeNorton v. Mathews, 427 U.S. 524, 532, 96 S.Ct. 2771, 2775, 49 L.Ed.2d 672 (1976);  Secretary of the Navy v. Avrech, 418 U.S. 676, 677-78, 94 S.Ct. 3039, 3039-40, 41 L.Ed.2d 1033 (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. General Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, appellant contends as a general matter that the district court applied incorrect standards of review in analyzing the instant bankruptcy court decision.  We find this argument to be without merit.  A district court reviews a bankruptcy court's judgment in the same manner in which we review lower court proceedings.  \"Findings of fact ... shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous....\"  Fed.R.Bankr. 8013;  seeNorth Atl.  Fishing, Inc. v. Geremia, 153 B.R. 607, 610 (D.R.I.1993).  Applications of law are reviewed de novo and are set aside only when they are made in error or constitute an \"abuse of discretion.\"  In re Gonic Realty Trust, 909 F.2d 624, 626-27 (1st Cir.1990);  In re Carter, 100 B.R. 123, 125 (D.Me.1989).  These standards were correctly applied by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>B. Legal Standard Applied to the Award of Fees</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant-creditor Casco also objects to the legal standard employed by the district court in reviewing the bankruptcy court's determination that debtor's counsel and other professionals were disinterested persons under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 328(c) and performed \"actual, necessary services\" resulting in a benefit to the estate pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Sec. 330(a).  Casco also argues that the bankruptcy court erred in its finding that debtor's counsel's work actually benefitted the estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The thrust of Casco's argument is that the perseverance of DN's counsel in submitting revised reorganization plans, following the proposal of Casco's plan, created no benefit to creditors and demonstrated that DN's counsel was not disinterested, since it sought to preserve investors' interests at the expense of the estate.  The district court held that the bankruptcy court's August 20, 1992 decision adequately explained the reasoning for full payment of fees to DN's counsel and other professionals.  We agree with both the bankruptcy and the district court's assessment on this issue.  DN's counsel's plans provided 100% payment to unsecured creditors just like Casco's proposal;  thus, the fact that DN's counsel's proposals attempted to maintain the viability of investments made by DN Associates' limited partners and also the integrity of the overall business operation does not signify that DN's counsel failed to remain disinterested or held an adverse interest to the estate.  The bankruptcy court concluded in its factual findings that \"DN's course was consistent with its fiduciary duties to all of the estate's constituencies.\"  In re DN Associates, 144 B.R. 195, 199 (Bankr.D.Me.1992).  We agree with the bankruptcy court that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>[i]t would be unfortunate if courts, looking only at plan provisions removed from context, concluded as a matter of law that a conflict of interest existed whenever a debtor and its counsel, in the face of creditor opposition, pursued a reorganization strategy that, while providing for creditors in a fashion consistent with Chapter 11 priorities, sought to adjust the rights and relations of parties-in-interest so that the interests of equity interest holders could be preserved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 200 (cited in Casco Northern Bank, N.A. v. DN Associates, 160 B.R. 20, 23 (D.Me.1993)).  In addition, regarding determinations of a \"materially adverse interest\" pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Sec. 327(a), we have rejected an \"inflexible\", \"per se\" standard.  SeeIn re Martin, 817 F.2d 175, 183 (1st Cir.1987).  The bankruptcy court was in the best position to observe and analyze DN's counsel's actions and proposals, and that court found that \"DN's plan sought to achieve none of [its] results by denying creditors their due.  DN proposed that unsecured creditors be paid in full shortly after confirmation;  that Casco retain its collateral and be paid its secured claim;  and that administrative claims be fully paid.\"  In re DN Associates, 144 B.R. 195, 199-200 (Bankr.D.Me.1992).  We find nothing in the record that would lead us to conclude that the bankruptcy court erred or abused its discretion in arriving at its legal determination that DN's counsel was not acting adversely to the estate.  As a matter of law, therefore, we affirm what both the bankruptcy court and the district court decided, that DN's counsel was a disinterested person and held no adverse interest to the estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both before the district court and the court of appeals, Casco has argued that the bankruptcy court erred in finding that DN's counsel's actions, following Casco's submission of a viable plan, constituted a benefit to the estate.  We, like the district court, have interpreted the bankruptcy court's lengthy discussion of interest and disinterest to address--implicitly if not explicitly--the benefit issue.  The bankruptcy court enumerated several arguably intangible, but nevertheless real, benefits to the estate from DN's counsel's proposals:  The plans attempted to protect all interested parties, including creditors and debtor's investors, seeIn re DN Associates, 144 B.R. 195, 199-201 (Bankr.D.Me.1992);  DN's counsel's \"persistent\" actions \"spurred\" Casco to develop its own plan--the reorganization eventually approved by the bankruptcy court, seeid. at 20;  and the resulting zealous, but reasonable, competition between plans and their drafters was constructive.  Seeid.   Moreover, as already advanced, counsel for one of the partially-secured creditors, GIAC, testified that the efforts of DN's counsel prompted a benefit in that the pressure of DN Associates' proposals created an atmosphere of constructive competition up until the \"eleventh hour\" that improved Casco's final amended plan.  The bankruptcy court's determinations regarding benefit were highly fact-intensive, and there is no evidence in the record that such findings of fact were clearly erroneous.  We cannot disturb both the bankruptcy and district courts' decisions finding as a matter of fact and law that the work performed by DN's counsel between September 3, 1991 and April 17, 1992 provided a benefit to the estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant findings of fact with respect to both the issue of adverse interest and benefit to the estate are not clearly erroneous.

After thoroughly reviewing the record on appeal, we affirm the district court's order allowing the fees and expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly outline the dispositive facts.  DN Associates, a limited partnership organized in Maine, purchased the Atlantic Motor Inn immediately before the severe real-estate-value plunge in New England, and ended up filing a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on April 19, 1991.  DN Associates' attempt at Chapter 11 reorganization came on the heels of Casco's commencement of an action in state court to foreclose on its mortgage of the Atlantic Motor Inn property.  DN Associates wanted to reorganize itself and avoid losing the investment of its limited partners by turning its investment into a profitable venture under the protection of the bankruptcy laws.  Throughout the ensuing bankruptcy proceedings, DN Associates was represented by James D. Poliquin, of the law firm of Norman, Hanson &amp; DeTroy (\"debtor's counsel\" or \"DN's counsel\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 19, 1991, DN Associates, as debtor in possession, filed its first proposed reorganization plan;  Casco, a secured creditor and lender of last resort, objected and moved for an appointment of a trustee or, in the alternative, to end debtor's period of exclusivity for proposing a resolution.  Casco indicated it would present a plan that provided for 100% payment to unsecured creditors.  On September 13, 1991, the bankruptcy court terminated DN Associates' exclusivity under the rationale that the plans offered by DN Associates and by Casco would be best considered simultaneously.  DN Associates filed its first amended plan on October 5, 1991, and Casco filed its proposed financial plan on November 25, 1991.  Both plans provided 100% payment to unsecured creditors, but DN Associates' proposal would have retained the interests of the limited partners through a recapitalization proposal.  Casco's plan differed in that it did not retain the interests of the limited partners and did not attempt to salvage DN Associates' business operation.  Following Casco's filing, DN Associates proceeded to offer three different amended plans as alternatives to Casco's proposed financial plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 17, 1992, the bankruptcy court confirmed an amended version of the plan proposed by Casco, thereby rejecting DN Associates' various reorganization alternatives.  Soon thereafter, DN's counsel filed an additional fee application seeking approval of $62,898.65 in fees of attorneys and other professionals incurred between September 3, 1991 and April 17, 1992.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In the bankruptcy court, Casco objected to both the fee award and the subsequent application and sought not only a disallowance of the final fee award, but also a return of fees previously awarded.  The rationale behind Casco's opposition was its understanding that the debtor's continued opposition to Casco's perfectly-reasonable plan and the repeated proposing of alternative plans by debtor's counsel to save the interest of the limited partners was adverse to the estate.  On the other hand, debtor's counsel insisted that his efforts were beneficial to the estate and expected to be compensated for his efforts by the bankruptcy court.  The record indicates that at least one partially-secured creditor, GIAC, represented by Attorney Fred W. Bopp, agreed in the bankruptcy proceedings that the persistence of DN's counsel in offering alternatives to Casco's plan positively affected the final resolution of the dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 20, 1992, the bankruptcy court overruled Casco's objections and awarded the requested amount of fees and expenses to DN's counsel and to the other professionals.  Five days later, Casco appealed the bankruptcy court's decision to the district court, arguing that DN's counsel represented interests adverse to the estate, and that such rendered services were not necessary and did not benefit the estate as required by statute.  On March 10, 1993, the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court, finding that the bankruptcy judge had not abused his discretion or erred in applying the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casco now appeals the district court's order on the following four issues:  First, whether as a matter of law the district court erred in its choice of the relevant standard of review;  second, whether as a matter of law the lower courts applied the wrong standard in ascertaining whether DN's counsel and other professionals performed \"actual, necessary services\" resulting in benefit to the bankruptcy estate under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 330(a);  third, whether as a matter of law the lower courts erred by applying the incorrect standard for determining if DN's counsel represented an interest adverse to the estate with regard to the prohibitions detailed at 11 U.S.C. Sec. 328(c);  and fourth, in the alternative, whether the district court abused its discretion in determining that DN's counsel and other professionals performed \"actual, necessary services\" resulting in benefit to the estate as required by 11 U.S.C. Sec. 330(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Relevant Bankruptcy Code Provisions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 323(a) of the Bankruptcy Code states that a trustee is the fiduciary of a bankrupt estate, 11 U.S.C. Sec. 323(a), and 11 U.S.C. Sec. 1107(a) provides that a debtor in possession has similar rights and powers as a trustee.  Bankruptcy courts are given the discretionary authority to compensate professionals employed under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 327 by an estate trustee or debtor in possession for \"actual, necessary services\" from estate assets and to similarly reimburse professionals for \"actual, necessary expenses.\"  11 U.S.C. Sec. 330(a)(1)-(2);  see also 11 U.S.C. Sec. 331 (interim compensation by application of professional).  By the same token, bankruptcy courts must limit or deny such remuneration if the professionals at issue are found not to be \"disinterested\" persons<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> or if their work does not \"benefit\" the estate or creditors.  11 U.S.C. Sec. 328(c).  However, courts may grant attorney's fees even if a conflict of interest is demonstrated, as long as such an award is sensible in light of the circumstances.

General Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, appellant contends as a general matter that the district court applied incorrect standards of review in analyzing the instant bankruptcy court decision.  We find this argument to be without merit.  A district court reviews a bankruptcy court's judgment in the same manner in which we review lower court proceedings.  \"Findings of fact ... shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous....\"  Fed.R.Bankr. 8013;  seeNorth Atl.

Legal Standard Applied to the Award of Fees</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant-creditor Casco also objects to the legal standard employed by the district court in reviewing the bankruptcy court's determination that debtor's counsel and other professionals were disinterested persons under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 328(c) and performed \"actual, necessary services\" resulting in a benefit to the estate pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Sec. 330(a).  Casco also argues that the bankruptcy court erred in its finding that debtor's counsel's work actually benefitted the estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The thrust of Casco's argument is that the perseverance of DN's counsel in submitting revised reorganization plans, following the proposal of Casco's plan, created no benefit to creditors and demonstrated that DN's counsel was not disinterested, since it sought to preserve investors' interests at the expense of the estate.  The district court held that the bankruptcy court's August 20, 1992 decision adequately explained the reasoning for full payment of fees to DN's counsel and other professionals.  We agree with both the bankruptcy and the district court's assessment on this issue.  DN's counsel's plans provided 100% payment to unsecured creditors just like Casco's proposal;  thus, the fact that DN's counsel's proposals attempted to maintain the viability of investments made by DN Associates' limited partners and also the integrity of the overall business operation does not signify that DN's counsel failed to remain disinterested or held an adverse interest to the estate.  The bankruptcy court concluded in its factual findings that \"DN's course was consistent with its fiduciary duties to all of the estate's constituencies.\"  In re DN Associates, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2028828\"><a href=\"/opinion/2028828/in-re-dn-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span>, 199 (Bankr.D.Me.1992).

In addition, regarding determinations of a \"materially adverse interest\" pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Sec. 327(a), we have rejected an \"inflexible\", \"per se\" standard.

The bankruptcy court was in the best position to observe and analyze DN's counsel's actions and proposals, and that court found that \"DN's plan sought to achieve none of [its] results by denying creditors their due.  DN proposed that unsecured creditors be paid in full shortly after confirmation;  that Casco retain its collateral and be paid its secured claim;  and that administrative claims be fully paid.\"  In re DN Associates, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2028828\"><a href=\"/opinion/2028828/in-re-dn-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span>, 199-200 (Bankr.D.Me.1992).  We find nothing in the record that would lead us to conclude that the bankruptcy court erred or abused its discretion in arriving at its legal determination that DN's counsel was not acting adversely to the estate.  As a matter of law, therefore, we affirm what both the bankruptcy court and the district court decided, that DN's counsel was a disinterested person and held no adverse interest to the estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both before the district court and the court of appeals, Casco has argued that the bankruptcy court erred in finding that DN's counsel's actions, following Casco's submission of a viable plan, constituted a benefit to the estate.  We, like the district court, have interpreted the bankruptcy court's lengthy discussion of interest and disinterest to address--implicitly if not explicitly--the benefit issue.  The bankruptcy court enumerated several arguably intangible, but nevertheless real, benefits to the estate from DN's counsel's proposals:  The plans attempted to protect all interested parties, including creditors and debtor's investors, seeIn re DN Associates, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2028828\"><a href=\"/opinion/2028828/in-re-dn-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span>, 199-201 (Bankr.D.Me.1992);  DN's counsel's \"persistent\" actions \"spurred\" Casco to develop its own plan--the reorganization eventually approved by the bankruptcy court, seeid. at 20;  and the resulting zealous, but reasonable, competition between plans and their drafters was constructive.  Seeid.   Moreover, as already advanced, counsel for one of the partially-secured creditors, GIAC, testified that the efforts of DN's counsel prompted a benefit in that the pressure of DN Associates' proposals created an atmosphere of constructive competition up until the \"eleventh hour\" that improved Casco's final amended plan.  The bankruptcy court's determinations regarding benefit were highly fact-intensive, and there is no evidence in the record that such findings of fact were clearly erroneous.  We cannot disturb both the bankruptcy and district courts' decisions finding as a matter of fact and law that the work performed by DN's counsel between September 3, 1991 and April 17, 1992 provided a benefit to the estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant findings of fact with respect to both the issue of adverse interest and benefit to the estate are not clearly erroneous.  The application of law to the facts is well within the range of discretion that we afford bankruptcy courts.  We, therefore, affirm the decision of the court below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Debtor's counsel had already been compensated for $35,000 in fees and expenses incurred before September 3, 1991</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This category of professionals encompasses both \"disinterested\" persons as well as persons lacking an \"adverse interest.\"   SeeIn re Hub Business Forms, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1530095\"><a href=\"/opinion/1530095/in-re-hub-business-forms-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 318 (Bankr.D.Mass.1992) (quoting In re Martin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"487410\"><a href=\"/opinion/487410/in-re-larry-t-cynthia-j-martin-dba-a-w-drive-in-restaurant/\"><span class=\"volume\">817</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span>, 180 (1st Cir.1987))</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
