Finally, our review is confined to\r\n\nthe denial  of the  Rule 60(b)  motion; we do  not treat  the\r\n\nmerits of the  underlying judgment.  Ojeda-Toro,  853 F.2d at\r                                                           \r\n\n28.\r\n\n          Rule  60(b)(3)  allows  relief  from  judgment  for\r\n\n\"fraud   (whether   heretofore   denominated   intrinsic   or\r\n\nextrinsic),  misrepresentation,  or  other misconduct  of  an\r\n\nadverse  party.\"    Appellant  alleges  that  appellee  First\r\n\nNational   Bank  of   Boston  (the   \"Bank\")  made   numerous\r\n\nmisrepresentations of fact in its motion for summary judgment\r\n\non appellant's  claim that  her  employment at  the Bank  was\r\n\nterminated   based  on  her   national  origin  (Iranian)  in\r\n\nviolation of  Title VII of the  Civil Rights Act  of 1964, 42\r\n\nU.S.C.    2000e  et seq.   To  prevail on  her Rule  60(b)(3)\r                                    \r\r\n\nmotion,    appellant   must    show   that    these   alleged\r\n\nmisrepresentations  prevented  her  from  \"fully  and fairly\"\r\n\npresenting her defense  to the summary judgment  motion.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nIn  re M/V Peacock, 809  F.2d 1403, 1404-05  (9th Cir. 1987).\r                              \r\n\nMisrepresentations can have this effect only when a party did\r\n\nnot  have knowledge of the alleged  inaccuracies or access to\r\n\ninformation which  could have  resulted in this  knowledge at\r\n\nthe  time of the alleged misconduct.  Ojeda-Toro, 853 F.2d at\r                                                            \r\n\n29.\r\n\n          In  support  of  her   claim  that  the  Bank  made\r\n\nmisrepresentations  of  fact   in  the  motion   for  summary\r\n\njudgment, appellant points to  the documents submitted by the\r\n\nBank in support of the motion and the documents she submitted\r\n\nin opposition to the  motion.  Indeed, appellant specifically\r\n\nstates  in her brief on  appeal that she  brought the alleged\r\n\nmisrepresentations to  the  attention of  the district  court\r\n\nprior to its grant of summary judgment.\r                    \r\n\n          \"Even  where misrepresentations  are made  during a\r\n\nlitigation, it is not  an abuse of discretion to  deny relief\r\n\nto  the losing party under Rule 60(b)(3), where the party had\r\n\naccess  to accurate  information.\"   7 J.  Moore &amp;  J. Lucas,\r\n\nMoore's Federal  Practice    60.24[5],  at 90  (2d ed.  Supp.\r                                     \r\n\n1994-95)  (footnote omitted).   Because appellant already had\r\n\npresented  her position to the district  court, we cannot say\r\n\nthat  the  Bank's supposed  misrepresentations  prevented her\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nfrom  fully presenting her case.   See In re M/V Peacock, 809\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at 1405.  Thus,  the court did not abuse  its discretion\r\n\nin determining  that appellant could  not rely on  the Bank's\r\n\nalleged fraud as a reason for relief from judgment under Rule\r\n\n60(b)(3).  We  therefore need not reach  the question whether\r\n\nappellant's  Rule   60(b)(3)  motion   was  filed   within  a\r\n\nreasonable time.\r\n\n          The judgment of the  district court is affirmed and\r                                                                     \r\n\nappellant's request for oral argument is denied.\r                                                           \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
