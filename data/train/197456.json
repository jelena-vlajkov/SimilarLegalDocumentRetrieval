Castro Lang with whom  F. Castro Amy was  on brief for\r\nappellants.\r\nSylvia Roger Stefani, Assistant  Solicitor General, Department of\r\nJustice, \r                with \r                    whom \r                         Carlos\r                               Lugo Fiol, Solicitor General, and Edda Serrano\r\nBlasini, Deputy Solicitor General, were on brief for appellees.\r\n\n                                        \r\n\n                        July 9, 1997\r\n                                        \r\r\n\n     BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.   Plaintiffs in this action,  all\r\n\nmembers of  the Puerto Rico  National Guard,  were called  to\r\n\nactive \r                  duty \r                       in the Persian Gulf War.  Prior to active duty and\r\n\nbriefly upon their return, they were employed full-time in  a\r\n\nNational Guard program  to assist in drug interdiction.   Not\r\n\nlong after their return,  the plaintiffs' assignment to  this\r\n\nprogram \r                   was \r                      terminated \r                                 by the Puerto Rico National Guard.  When\r\n\nthe \r               plaintiffs sued, the district court ruled that they had no\r\n\nstatutory \r                     right to reemployment in such a program.  We affirm.\r\n\n     The  basic facts are  not in dispute.   The Puerto  Rico\r\n\nNational Guard, like the National Guards in all 50 states, is\r\n\na hybrid organization.  National Guards are ordinarily  under\r\n\nthe  control  of state  (or,  in  the case  of  Puerto  Rico,\r\n\nCommonwealth)\r                         officials, but are organized pursuant to federal\r\n\nstatute, \r                    and \r                        in war time or other emergencies, Guard units may\r\n\nbe brought under federal  control.  See U.S. Const., art.  I,\r\n\nsec. 8, cl. 16; 32 U.S.C. S 101, et seq.\r\n\n     In \r                   1989, \r                        Congress \r                                 authorized federal funding to permit the\r\n\nlocal National Guards to support drug interdiction and  other\r\n\ncounter-drug activities.    32 U.S.C.  S  112.   Section  112\r\n\nprovided \r                    that each state desiring to participate would draw up\r\n\nits own plan subject to approval by the Secretary of Defense.\r\n\nDespite this and other authority over the program granted  to\r\n\nthe Secretary  of  Defense,  the statute  required  that  the\r\n\nNational \r                    Guard personnel involved in these operations be under\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nlocal \r                 control and \"not in Federal service,\" id. S 112(c)(1), a\r\n\nrequirement  apparently  designed  to  mesh  with  the  Posse\r\n\nComitatus Act, 18 U.S.C. S 1385, limiting the use of  federal\r\n\ntroops for domestic law enforcement purposes.\r\n\n     Most National Guard  members ordinarily serve only  part\r\n\ntime, but there are exceptions.  Section 112 itself  provided\r\n\nthat  subject to  Secretary  of  Defense  regulations,  local\r\n\nNational Guard members  could, pursuant to a state plan,  \"be\r\n\nordered \r                   to \r                      perform full-time National Guard duty under section\r\n\n502(f)  of this title  for the purpose  of carrying out  drug\r\n\ninterdiction \r                        and counter-drug activities.\"  32 U.S.C. S 502(f)\r\n\nallows  National Guard  personnel to  be assigned  additional\r\n\nduties, apart from ordinary drills and field exercises,  with\r\n\nthe provision appropriate for \"pay and allowances.\"\r\n\n     Beginning \r                          in \r                             1989, \r                                  the \r                                      Puerto Rico National Guard used the\r\n\nfederal funds  provided under section  112 for  a variety  of\r\n\ncounter-drug projects.   In one of the projects, Puerto  Rico\r\n\nNational Guard personnel assisted the U.S. Customs Service in\r\n\ninspecting cargo containers arriving and leaving Puerto  Rico\r\n\nports and airports.  Each of the plaintiffs in this case is a\r\n\nPuerto Rico National  Guard member who  was assigned to  work\r\n\nfull-time in 1989 to  1990 in this phase of the  counter-drug\r\n\nprogram.  Minor variations aside, each plaintiff worked under\r\n\norders couched in the following terms:\r\n\n          You are  ordered to  Active Duty  special\r\n          work (ADSW) for the period indicated plus\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n          allowable \r                               travel time.  Upon completion of\r\n          the period of ADSW unless sooner relieved\r\n          or extended by proper authority you  will\r\n          return \r                            to \r                               the place where you entered ADSW\r\n          and are relieved from such duty.\r\n\n     According to the memorandum of understanding between the\r\n\nPuerto Rico National Guard and the Customs Service, \"National\r\n\nGuard personnel employed in support of [the Customs  Service]\r\n\nfor counter-drug operations will be under the command of, and\r\n\ndirectly \r                    responsible to their military chain of command.\"  The\r\n\nmemorandum also  said  that \"all  missions will  be  executed\r\n\nthrough \r                   the \r                      military \r                               chain of command; i.e., tactical direction\r\n\nof the troops . . . will be left solely to the National Guard\r\n\nOfficers in Charge/Noncommissioned Officer in Charge.\"\r\n\n     Thus, the plaintiffs  working in  the drug  interdiction\r\n\nprogram \r                   were \r                       ultimately \r                                  commanded and controlled by Puerto Rico\r\n\nNational Guard officers, and they were paid for their work by\r\n\nthe Puerto  Rico National Guard  from funds  provided by  the\r\n\nfederal government.  However, much of the plaintiffs' day-to-\r\n\nday work was directed by Customs Service officials.  The work\r\n\nitself \r                  did \r                      not \r                         entail \r                                the use of any specialized military skill\r\n\nbut  consisted  mainly  of  unloading  and  reloading   cargo\r\n\ncontainers or inspecting their contents.\r\n\n     The \r                    plaintiffs' pay and allowances for full-time National\r\n\nGuard duty in  the program were substantial (e.g., $1,400  to\r\n\n$2,000  per  month).   Each  plaintiff  worked  under  orders\r\n\nassigning \r                     him such duty for a relatively brief period, ranging\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nfrom \r                2 \r                  days \r                       to 61 days, but the orders were regularly renewed.\r\n\nAt \r              trial \r                    the \r                       plaintiffs \r                                  testified that they believed that these\r\n\norders \r                  would \r                        be \r                          renewed \r                                  indefinitely so long as funding for the\r\n\ndrug interdiction program continued.  They said that they had\r\n\nbeen given assurances that they would not be dismissed unless\r\n\nthey failed to perform their work satisfactorily.\r\n\n     In January 1991, all of the plaintiffs were called  into\r\n\nactive service  on account of the  Persian Gulf War and  left\r\n\ntheir  positions  in the  drug  interdiction  program.    The\r\n\nplaintiffs completed their  active federal  military duty  in\r\n\nearly \r                 July \r                      1991 \r                          and \r                              were \r                                   reassigned by the Puerto Rico National\r\n\nGuard \r                 to \r                    the \r                        drug interdiction program for the period July 11,\r\n\n1991 \r                to \r                   September \r                            30, \r                                1991.  On October 1, 1991, the plaintiffs\r\n\nwere released from  full-time duty in the program, and  their\r\n\npositions taken by other Guard personnel.\r\n\n     In \r                   September \r                             1992, the plaintiffs brought suit in federal\r\n\ndistrict court in Puerto Rico seeking reinstatement and  back\r\n\npay.   The principal claim  brought against  the Puerto  Rico\r\n\nNational Guard \"and/or the United States of America\" was that\r\n\ndefendants  had violated  the  plaintiffs' rights  under  the\r\n\nVeterans' Reemployment Rights Act (\"the Veterans' Act\"), then\r\n\ncodified \r                    at \r                       38 U.S.C. S 2021 et seq., by not retaining them in\r\n\ntheir full-time  drug-interdiction positions following  their\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nreturn  from the  Gulf  War.   The  United States  was  later\r\n\ndismissed as a defendant.1  \r\n\n     The Puerto  Rico  National Guard  moved to  dismiss  the\r\n\ncomplaint on  several grounds, including  failure to state  a\r\n\nclaim, non-justiciability, Eleventh Amendment immunity,  non-\r\n\nexhaustion of administrative remedies, and untimeliness.  The\r\n\ndistrict \r                    court deemed most of these defenses lacking in merit;\r\n\nand it  said that  the merits could  not be resolved  without\r\n\ndeveloping \r                      a \r                       factual \r                               record.  Accordingly, after discovery, the\r\n\ndistrict \r                    court \r                         conducted \r                                   a bench trial in August 1995 and heard\r\n\ntestimony from both sides.  \r\n\n     In \r                   a \r                     written \r                            decision \r                                     issued August 16, 1996, the district\r\n\ncourt dismissed the complaint.  It ruled that the  plaintiffs\r\n\ndid not  have  reemployment rights  under the  Veterans'  Act\r\n\nbecause their drug  interdiction positions were \"military  in\r\n\nnature\" and therefore beyond the statute's intended coverage;\r\n\nthe \r               court \r                     did not reach or resolve the defendants' alternative\r\n\nstatutory \r                     defense \r                            that \r                                 the plaintiffs be excluded from coverage\r\n\nbecause \r                   their \r                         posts \r                              were \r                                   \"temporary.\"  See 38 U.S.C. S 2021(a).\r\n\nThe district court entered  judgment for the defendants,  and\r\n\nthis appeal followed. \r\n\n     1The complaint also alleged that two individual Guard\r\nofficers had violated 42 U.S.C. S 1983 by refusing to retain\r\nthe plaintiffs in the program; but this claim was contingent\r\non a showing of violation of the Veterans' Act and requires\r\nno further discussion.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n     In our view, the district court was clearly right in its\r\n\nconstruction of the  federal statute, and  we affirm on  that\r\n\nground without addressing other  defenses.  Where the  result\r\n\nwould \r                 be \r                    the \r                        same, this court has often rejected claims on the\r\n\nmerits without resolving possible jurisdictional  objections.\r\n\nHachikian\r                     \r                     v. \r                        FDIC\r                           , \r                             96 \r                                F.3d 502, 506 n.4 (1st Cir. 1996).  Here,\r\n\nthe case ought to be  decided promptly, in view of the  delay\r\n\nalready \r                   suffered by the plaintiffs, and the legal issue is one\r\n\nthat can be decided definitively only by a federal court.  \r\n\n     We begin  with the  terms of  the Veterans'  Act.   This\r\n\nstatute, enacted  in 1978,  carried forward  the policy  that\r\n\nCongress \r                    first \r                         adopted \r                                 in 1940 to provide employment protection\r\n\nfor veterans  returning  from military  service.   Monroe  v.\r\n\nStandard Oil Co., 452 U.S. 549, 554-55 (1981).  Although  the\r\n\nVeterans' Act has itself been superseded by a new enactment--\r\n\nthe \r               Uniform \r                      Services \r                               Employment and Reemployment Act, 38 U.S.C.\r\n\nS 4301 et seq.--the new statute applies only to reemployments\r\n\ninitiated on or after October 13, 1994.  110 Stat. 3336.\r\n\n     The Veterans'  Act  main section  granting  reemployment\r\n\nrights is  38 U.S.C. S  2021, which  provides protection  for\r\n\nanyone \"inducted into the Armed Forces of the United  States\"\r\n\nunder the selective service statute.  A companion section, 28\r\n\nU.S.C. S 2024, extends similar protection, by cross-reference\r\n\nback to  section 2021, to  several other  classes of  persons\r\n\nincluding reservists and others called to \"active duty (other\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nthan \r                for \r                    the \r                        purpose of determining physical fitness and other\r\n\nthan for training) . . . .\"  Concededly, the plaintiffs  were\r\n\ncalled to active duty in 1991.\r\n\n     Section 2021(a) provides that an inductee (or by  cross-\r\n\nreference a reservist  called to active  duty) \"who leaves  a\r\n\nposition \r                    (other \r                           than \r                               a \r                                 temporary position) in the employ of any\r\n\nemployer\" \r                     is \r                        entitled to reemployment if sought within 90 days\r\n\nafter  release  from  the  military.    The  conditions   and\r\n\nobligations  vary somewhat  depending  on whether  the  prior\r\n\nemployer was governmental or private, but it is common ground\r\n\nthat the  statute protects  prior employment  by the  federal\r\n\ngovernment, the states, and the Commonwealth of Puerto  Rico.\r\n\nSee  38  U.S.C.

S  101(20)  (defining  the\r\n\nCommonwealth as a state for this purpose).\r\n\n     Although \r                         the \r                             Veterans' Act covers \"a position (other than\r\n\na temporary  position) in the  employ of  any employer,\"  the\r\n\ndefendants argue that  the statute was  not meant to  protect\r\n\nprior employment in a military position.  We consider at  the\r\n\noutset whether the statute,  which contains no such  limiting\r\n\nterm, \r                 should \r                        be \r                          so \r                             construed; and, finding that it should be so\r\n\nread, we then return to the question whether the  plaintiffs'\r\n\nformer positions in the  drug interdiction program should  be\r\n\nregarded as unprotected military  positions.  Both are  legal\r\n\nquestions, but of slightly different character.  \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\n     As we have noted,  no express term in the Veterans'  Act\r\n\nlimits a  protectible  former  \"position\" to  a  position  in\r\n\ncivilian  employment  or   excludes  from  the  category   of\r\n\nprotectible \r                       positions a military assignment.  Nevertheless, it\r\n\nis \r              apparent \r                       to \r                         us \r                            that \r                                 the statute must be thus construed.  The\r\n\nevidence for this conclusion is provided by the structure and\r\n\npurpose of the statute, by extrinsic policy safeguarding  the\r\n\nautonomy  of  military organizations,  and  by  the  lack  of\r\n\nprecedent  extending  reemployment  protection  to   military\r\n\npositions.\r\n\n     First, the very design of the Veterans' Act makes  clear\r\n\nits  central aim was  to protect those  who were inducted  or\r\n\notherwise drawn  into military life  and thereby required  to\r\n\nsurrender \r                     their \r                          civilian \r                                   jobs.  The Supreme Court, for example,\r\n\nhas  spoken of  the Veterans'  Act as  relating to  \"military\r\n\nservice after which a member of the Armed Forces retains  the\r\n\nright to civilian employment.\"  King v. St. Vincent's  Hosp.,\r\n\n502 \r               U.S. \r                    215, \r                        216 \r                            (1991).  Congress probably did not insert the\r\n\nword \"civilian\" before  \"position\" simply  because it  seemed\r\n\nunnecessary to add a term made almost redundant by context.  \r\n\n     Each of the provisions providing reemployment protection\r\n\nis \r              directed \r                       at \r                         persons \r                                 who cross the barrier from civilian into\r\n\nmilitary life:   the  inductee (section  2021), the  enlistee\r\n\n(section 2024(a)), the  reservist entering  upon active  duty\r\n\n(other than  for physical  fitness testing  or for  training)\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n(section 2024(b)), and certain persons who enter upon  active\r\n\nduty for training or inactive duty training (subsections  (c)\r\n\nand \r               (d)). \r                      \r                      It \r                        is \r                           persons \r                                   who leave \"a position\" to perform such\r\n\nduties and thereafter seek to \"be restored to such  position\"\r\n\nwho are protected.  38 U.S.C. S 2021(a).\r\n\n     There is simply no  hint in all this that when  Congress\r\n\nsought to  protect prior employment,  it intended to  protect\r\n\nprior  employment in a  military capacity.   It is true  that\r\n\ncivilian \r                    employees of state and federal military organizations\r\n\nare \r               themselves \r                         protected \r                                   if called to active duty.  See Panigua\r\n\nv. Department  of  the Air  Force,  13 M.S.P.R.  306,  307-09\r\n\n(M.S.P.B. 1982).  But such civilian employees of the military\r\n\nare akin  to civilian employees  of any  other department  of\r\n\ngovernment.  Military employees are a different matter.\r\n\n     This brings us  to a further, reenforcing reason why  we\r\n\ndecline to  read the  Veterans' Act  to protect  reemployment\r\n\nrights \r                  in \r                    former \r                           military positions.  The courts have long been\r\n\nreluctant to interfere with internal military decisionmaking,\r\n\nincluding \r                     personnel decisions.  With only rare exceptions, the\r\n\ncourts \r                  have \r                       taken \r                            the \r                                view that assignments within the military\r\n\nstructure \r                     are matters to be decided by the military and not by\r\n\nthe  courts.  See  Orloff v. Willoughby,  345 U.S. 83,  93-94\r\n\n(1953).  The reasons are too obvious to need elaboration.\r\n\n     In some situations, this view is expressed by deeming  a\r\n\ncontroversy to be nonjusticiable, Wright v. Park, 5 F.3d 586,\r\n\n                            -10-\r                                        -10-\r\r\n\n589-91 \r                  (1st \r                       Cir. 1993); in others, it takes the form of giving\r\n\ngreat deference to  the military's judgment on the matter  at\r\n\nhand.  Richenberg v. Perry, 97 F.3d 256, 261 (8th Cir. 1996).\r\n\nBut  the  underlying  notion  is  that  matters  of  military\r\n\norganization,\r                         personnel and operations are extremely sensitive\r\n\nand that courts will do more harm than good by  interfering. \r\n\nCongress \r                    can \r                        provide otherwise by statute, but rarely does so.\r\n\n     Thus, we conclude that Veterans' Act protections do  not\r\n\nextend to affording anyone reemployment rights in a  military\r\n\nposition.    However generously  the  Veterans'  Act  may  be\r\n\nconstrued  to protect  prior civilian  employment, Tilton  v.\r\n\nMissouri P.R.R., 376  U.S. 169, 181 (1964), Congress did  not\r\n\nintend \r                  that \r                      anyone \r                             should have a preemptive claim to his former\r\n\nposition  as an air  force pilot or  an army tank  commander.\r\n\nWhether the plaintiffs' positions in the Puerto Rico National\r\n\nGuard \r                 drug \r                      interdiction program should be viewed as sharing in\r\n\nthis \r                \"military\" character is a different issue to which we now\r\n\nturn.\r\n\n     It \r                   is \r                      clear \r                            from section 112 and the orders issued to the\r\n\nplaintiffs that their participation in the drug  interdiction\r\n\nprogram \r                   was \r                      the \r                          performance of \"full-time National Guard duty.\"\r\n\nThe \r               drug \r                   interdiction \r                                statute, 32 U.S.C. S 112(b), provides for\r\n\nGuard personnel  to perform such  National Guard duty  \"under\r\n\nsection 502(f)\" to carry  out drug interdiction; and  section\r\n\n502(f) \r                  allows Guard members to be ordered to perform \"training\r\n\n                            -11-\r                                        -11-\r\r\n\nor  other  duty\"  in addition  to  assembly  for  drills  and\r\n\nencampment. \r                        \r                        The \r                           orders \r                                  issued to the plaintiffs made reference\r\n\nto section 502(f) and, in certain cases, section 503 which is\r\n\na companion provision involving joint exercises with the army\r\n\nor the air force.\r\n\n     In addition, the evidence shows that the plaintiffs were\r\n\nparticipating in the  drug interdiction  program pursuant  to\r\n\nmilitary \r                    orders and were subject to the command and control of\r\n\nGuard \r                 officers. \r                            \r                           Indeed, \r                                   it appears likely that the plaintiffs'\r\n\nfull-time \r                     positions \r                              in \r                                 the drug interdiction program might have\r\n\nallowed \r                   them \r                        to claim reemployment rights in any civilian jobs\r\n\nthey \r                held \r                     at \r                       the \r                           time \r                                they entered upon full-time duty.  See 38\r\n\nU.S.C. S 2024(c)(d); id. S 101(22)(C).  In all events,  full-\r\n\ntime National  Guard duty by  a Guard  member under  military\r\n\norders appears to us quintessentially military in character. \r\n\n     It \r                   is \r                      quite \r                            true that the physical tasks performed by the\r\n\nplaintiffs could have been,  and commonly were, performed  by\r\n\ncustoms \r                   officers \r                           who \r                               were not in military service.  But this is\r\n\ncommon:  one can be a cook or a pilot or a  radio operator in\r\n\neither military  or civilian  life.   National Guard  members\r\n\ncalled to duty to  build up the dikes  in a flooded area  are\r\n\nstill part  of the military even  though they are engaged  in\r\n\nconstruction work.  Given  Congress' intent to protect  prior\r\n\ncivilian jobs  for those serving in  the military, it is  the\r\n\nnature \r                  of \r                     the employment--not its functions--that is decisive.\r\n\n                            -12-\r                                        -12-\r\r\n\n     The same result follows from extrinsic policy.  It would\r\n\ndirectly offend the tradition of non-interference in military\r\n\nassignments  for a  court to  direct that  the plaintiffs  be\r\n\nrestored to performing  specific functions as National  Guard\r\n\nmembers assigned to full-time  duty in the drug  interdiction\r\n\nprogram.  The Puerto Rico National Guard cited as reasons for\r\n\nits reshuffling of personnel  \"unity of command\" and  \"rank.\"\r\n\nThe \r               plaintiffs \r                          say \r                             that \r                                  these objectives could have been met by\r\n\na \r             different \r                      reorganization that retained their jobs; but making\r\n\nthese evaluations is just what courts are reluctant to do.\r\n\n     It remains  to refer  briefly to  cases involving  Guard\r\n\nemployees governed by the  National Guard Technicians Act  of\r\n\n1968,  32 U.S.C.  S 709.   These  technicians are  \"full-time\r\n\ncivilian \r                    employees \r                             of \r                                the National Guard\" who are also, in most\r\n\ncases, required to hold \"concurrent National Guard membership\r\n\nas a condition for their civilian employment.\"  H.R. Rep. No.\r\n\n90-1823, at 2 (1968).  E.g., Wright, 5 F.3d at 587 (full-time\r\n\naircraft maintenance specialist).\r\n\n     In \r                   a \r                     number \r                            of \r                              cases, \r                                     a \r                                       National Guard technician has been\r\n\ncalled to active service and forced to surrender his civilian\r\n\ntechnician duties with  the Guard.   The question has  arisen\r\n\nwhether  this technician  position  is  protected  under  the\r\n\nVeterans' \r                     Act \r                        after \r                              active duty ends.  One district court ruled\r\n\nin \r              favor \r                    of \r                       coverage, although it assumed rather than analyzed\r\n\nthe statutory-coverage issue,  and several other courts  have\r\n\n                            -13-\r                                        -13-\r\r\n\nbeen willing to assume such coverage          in denying  th\r\n\ntechnician's reemployment protection on other grounds.2\r\n\n     H\r                                                 arguendo               e\r                  ow \r                    this \r                         court \r                              would \r                                    decide such a case is unclear.  There\r\n\nis  language  in  Wright v.  Park  that  would  lean  against\r\n\nprotection, although the rights claimed by the technician  in\r\n\nthat \r                case \r                     were not under the Veterans' Act but under the Civil\r\n\nRights \r                  Act, \r                       42 U.S.C. SS 1983, 1985, and the federal and state\r\n\nwhistle-blower  statutes.   On  the  other  hand,  a  passing\r\n\nreference in the new reemployment statute that has supplanted\r\n\nthe Veterans'  Act may give  some support  to National  Guard\r\n\ntechnicians who claim reemployment protection.  See 38 U.S.C.\r\n\nS 4304(4)(B);  see also H.R. Rep.  No. 103-65, at 21  (1994).\r\n\nHowever such cases  might be decided, we think that  National\r\n\nGuard  technicians  are  clearly  distinguishable  from   the\r\n\nplaintiffs in this case. \r\n\n     National Guard technicians are employed full-time by the\r\n\nGuard in  a civilian  capacity.   In this  respect, they  are\r\n\narguably protected  under the  Veterans' Act  like any  other\r\n\ncivilian \r                    employees \r                              of \r                                a \r                                  federal or state military organization.\r\n\nThe difficulty,  where such  civilian positions  are tied  to\r\n\nmembership in the National Guard, is that reinstatement would\r\n\nrequire either that the  military tie-in be waived or that  a\r\n\n     2See Witter v.

The issue  was\r\n\navoided in Witter  because plaintiff in  that case no  longer\r\n\nsought reemployment but merely monetary compensation.  462 F.\r\n\nSupp. at 306.\r\n\n     In \r                   any \r                       event, the plaintiffs in the present case were not\r\n\nemployed \r                    as \r                       technicians with the curious dual capacity of that\r\n\nposition:   full-time  civilian  employment with  an  adjunct\r\n\nmilitary role.  The plaintiffs' only status was as \"full-time\r\n\nNational Guard\" members assigned, under a state plan approved\r\n\nby the Secretary of Defense, to work under military orders in\r\n\nthe drug interdiction program.  Even assuming that this court\r\n\nmight \r                 follow \r                        Witter\r                              \r                              and \r                                  extend protection to technicians--which\r\n\nis far from clear--this would not affect our decision in  the\r\n\npresent case  that the plaintiffs  are not  protected by  the\r\n\nVeterans' Act.\r\n\n      To \r                    this \r                         point, we have said little about the new federal\r\n\nstatute \r                   which, as of October 1994, supplants the Veterans' Act\r\n\nand provides  a  new  framework for  reemployment  rights  of\r\n\nveterans. \r                      \r                      This new statute does not apply to the present case\r\n\nand is not direct evidence of the intent of the Congress that\r\n\nenacted the Veterans' Act.  But the new statute is in certain\r\n\nrespects \r                    a \r                     reenactment \r                                 of the Veterans' Act in somewhat clearer\r\n\nlanguage, \r                     and \r                         it \r                           would \r                                 certainly be deserving of mention if the\r\n\nnew \r               version \r                      were \r                           strongly favorable either to the plaintiffs or\r\n\nthe defendants.\r\n\n                            -15-\r                                        -15-\r\r\n\n     The \r                    fact \r                         is \r                            that the new statute carries forward the same\r\n\nambiguity \r                     in \r                        literal language that afflicts the Veterans' Act.\r\n\nIt protects, subject to certain conditions, \"any person whose\r\n\nabsence \r                   from \r                        a \r                         position \r                                  of employment is necessitated by reason\r\n\nof service in the uniformed services . . . .\"  About the most\r\n\nto be said is  that the new statute provides that  \"full-time\r\n\nNational \r                    Guard duty\" is included in the definition of \"service\r\n\nin the uniformed services,\" 38 U.S.C.

Plaintiffs in this action,  all\r\n\nmembers of  the Puerto Rico  National Guard,  were called  to\r\n\nactive \r                  duty \r                       in the Persian Gulf War.  Prior to active duty and\r\n\nbriefly upon their return, they were employed full-time in  a\r\n\nNational Guard program  to assist in drug interdiction.   Not\r\n\nlong after their return,  the plaintiffs' assignment to  this\r\n\nprogram \r                   was \r                      terminated \r                                 by the Puerto Rico National Guard.  When\r\n\nthe \r               plaintiffs sued, the district court ruled that they had no\r\n\nstatutory \r                     right to reemployment in such a program.  We affirm.\r\n\n     The  basic facts are  not in dispute.   The Puerto  Rico\r\n\nNational Guard, like the National Guards in all 50 states, is\r\n\na hybrid organization.  National Guards are ordinarily  under\r\n\nthe  control  of state  (or,  in  the case  of  Puerto  Rico,\r\n\nCommonwealth)\r                         officials, but are organized pursuant to federal\r\n\nstatute, \r                    and \r                        in war time or other emergencies, Guard units may\r\n\nbe brought under federal  control.  See U.S. Const., art.  I,\r\n\nsec. 8, cl. 16; 32 U.S.C. S 101, et seq.\r\n\n     In \r                   1989, \r                        Congress \r                                 authorized federal funding to permit the\r\n\nlocal National Guards to support drug interdiction and  other\r\n\ncounter-drug activities.    32 U.S.C.  S  112.   Section  112\r\n\nprovided \r                    that each state desiring to participate would draw up\r\n\nits own plan subject to approval by the Secretary of Defense.\r\n\nDespite this and other authority over the program granted  to\r\n\nthe Secretary  of  Defense,  the statute  required  that  the\r\n\nNational \r                    Guard personnel involved in these operations be under\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nlocal \r                 control and \"not in Federal service,\" </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> S 112(c)(1), </span><pre class=\"inline\">a\r\n\nrequirement  apparently  designed  to  mesh  with  the  Posse\r\n\nComitatus Act, 18 U.S.C. S 1385, limiting the use of  federal\r\n\ntroops for domestic law enforcement purposes.\r\n\n     Most National Guard  members ordinarily serve only  part\r\n\ntime, but there are exceptions.  Section 112 itself  provided\r\n\nthat  subject to  Secretary  of  Defense  regulations,  local\r\n\nNational Guard members  could, pursuant to a state plan,  \"be\r\n\nordered \r                   to \r                      perform full-time National Guard duty under section\r\n\n502(f)  of this title  for the purpose  of carrying out  drug\r\n\ninterdiction \r                        and counter-drug activities.\"  32 U.S.C. S 502(f)\r\n\nallows  National Guard  personnel to  be assigned  additional\r\n\nduties, apart from ordinary drills and field exercises,  with\r\n\nthe provision appropriate for \"pay and allowances.\"\r\n\n     Beginning \r                          in \r                             1989, \r                                  the \r                                      Puerto Rico National Guard used the\r\n\nfederal funds  provided under section  112 for  a variety  of\r\n\ncounter-drug projects.   In one of the projects, Puerto  Rico\r\n\nNational Guard personnel assisted the U.S. Customs Service in\r\n\ninspecting cargo containers arriving and leaving Puerto  Rico\r\n\nports and airports.  Each of the plaintiffs in this case is a\r\n\nPuerto Rico National  Guard member who  was assigned to  work\r\n\nfull-time in 1989 to  1990 in this phase of the  counter-drug\r\n\nprogram.  Minor variations aside, each plaintiff worked under\r\n\norders couched in the following terms:\r\n\n          You are  ordered to  Active Duty  special\r\n          work (ADSW) for the period indicated plus\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n          allowable \r                               travel time.  Upon completion of\r\n          the period of ADSW unless sooner relieved\r\n          or extended by proper authority you  will\r\n          return \r                            to \r                               the place where you entered ADSW\r\n          and are relieved from such duty.\r\n\n     According to the memorandum of understanding between the\r\n\nPuerto Rico National Guard and the Customs Service, \"National\r\n\nGuard personnel employed in support of [the Customs  Service]\r\n\nfor counter-drug operations will be under the command of, and\r\n\ndirectly \r                    responsible to their military chain of command.\"  The\r\n\nmemorandum also  said  that \"all  missions will  be  executed\r\n\nthrough \r                   the \r                      military \r                               chain of command; i.e., tactical direction\r\n\nof the troops . . . will be left solely to the National Guard\r\n\nOfficers in Charge/Noncommissioned Officer in Charge.\"\r\n\n     Thus, the plaintiffs  working in  the drug  interdiction\r\n\nprogram \r                   were \r                       ultimately \r                                  commanded and controlled by Puerto Rico\r\n\nNational Guard officers, and they were paid for their work by\r\n\nthe Puerto  Rico National Guard  from funds  provided by  the\r\n\nfederal government.  However, much of the plaintiffs' day-to-\r\n\nday work was directed by Customs Service officials.  The work\r\n\nitself \r                  did \r                      not \r                         entail \r                                the use of any specialized military skill\r\n\nbut  consisted  mainly  of  unloading  and  reloading   cargo\r\n\ncontainers or inspecting their contents.\r\n\n     The \r                    plaintiffs' pay and allowances for full-time National\r\n\nGuard duty in  the program were substantial (e.g., $1,400  to\r\n\n$2,000  per  month).   Each  plaintiff  worked  under  orders\r\n\nassigning \r                     him such duty for a relatively brief period, ranging\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nfrom \r                2 \r                  days \r                       to 61 days, but the orders were regularly renewed.\r\n\nAt \r              trial \r                    the \r                       plaintiffs \r                                  testified that they believed that these\r\n\norders \r                  would \r                        be \r                          renewed \r                                  indefinitely so long as funding for the\r\n\ndrug interdiction program continued.  They said that they had\r\n\nbeen given assurances that they would not be dismissed unless\r\n\nthey failed to perform their work satisfactorily.\r\n\n     In January 1991, all of the plaintiffs were called  into\r\n\nactive service  on account of the  Persian Gulf War and  left\r\n\ntheir  positions  in the  drug  interdiction  program.    The\r\n\nplaintiffs completed their  active federal  military duty  in\r\n\nearly \r                 July \r                      1991 \r                          and \r                              were \r                                   reassigned by the Puerto Rico National\r\n\nGuard \r                 to \r                    the \r                        drug interdiction program for the period July 11,\r\n\n1991 \r                to \r                   September \r                            30, \r                                1991.  On October 1, 1991, the plaintiffs\r\n\nwere released from  full-time duty in the program, and  their\r\n\npositions taken by other Guard personnel.\r\n\n     In \r                   September \r                             1992, the plaintiffs brought suit in federal\r\n\ndistrict court in Puerto Rico seeking reinstatement and  back\r\n\npay.   The principal claim  brought against  the Puerto  Rico\r\n\nNational Guard \"and/or the United States of America\" was that\r\n\ndefendants  had violated  the  plaintiffs' rights  under  the\r\n\nVeterans' Reemployment Rights Act (\"the Veterans' Act\"), then\r\n\ncodified \r                    at \r                       38 U.S.C. S 2021 et seq., by not retaining them in\r\n\ntheir full-time  drug-interdiction positions following  their\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nreturn  from the  Gulf  War.   The  United States  was  later\r\n\ndismissed as a defendant.1  \r\n\n     The Puerto  Rico  National Guard  moved to  dismiss  the\r\n\ncomplaint on  several grounds, including  failure to state  a\r\n\nclaim, non-justiciability, Eleventh Amendment immunity,  non-\r\n\nexhaustion of administrative remedies, and untimeliness.  The\r\n\ndistrict \r                    court deemed most of these defenses lacking in merit;\r\n\nand it  said that  the merits could  not be resolved  without\r\n\ndeveloping \r                      a \r                       factual \r                               record.  Accordingly, after discovery, the\r\n\ndistrict \r                    court \r                         conducted \r                                   a bench trial in August 1995 and heard\r\n\ntestimony from both sides.  \r\n\n     In \r                   a \r                     written \r                            decision \r                                     issued August 16, 1996, the district\r\n\ncourt dismissed the complaint.  It ruled that the  plaintiffs\r\n\ndid not  have  reemployment rights  under the  Veterans'  Act\r\n\nbecause their drug  interdiction positions were \"military  in\r\n\nnature\" and therefore beyond the statute's intended coverage;\r\n\nthe \r               court \r                     did not reach or resolve the defendants' alternative\r\n\nstatutory \r                     defense \r                            that \r                                 the plaintiffs be excluded from coverage\r\n\nbecause \r                   their \r                         posts \r                              were \r                                   \"temporary.\"  See 38 U.S.C. S 2021(a).\r\n\nThe district court entered  judgment for the defendants,  and\r\n\nthis appeal followed. \r\n\n     1The complaint also alleged that two individual Guard\r\nofficers had violated 42 U.S.C.

The\r\n\nevidence for this conclusion is provided by the structure and\r\n\npurpose of the statute, by extrinsic policy safeguarding  the\r\n\nautonomy  of  military organizations,  and  by  the  lack  of\r\n\nprecedent  extending  reemployment  protection  to   military\r\n\npositions.\r\n\n     First, the very design of the Veterans' Act makes  clear\r\n\nits  central aim was  to protect those  who were inducted  or\r\n\notherwise drawn  into military life  and thereby required  to\r\n\nsurrender \r                     their \r                          civilian \r                                   jobs.

It is true  that\r\n\ncivilian \r                    employees of state and federal military organizations\r\n\nare \r               themselves \r                         protected \r                                   if called to active duty.

But such civilian employees of the military\r\n\nare akin  to civilian employees  of any  other department  of\r\n\ngovernment.  Military employees are a different matter.\r\n\n     This brings us  to a further, reenforcing reason why  we\r\n\ndecline to  read the  Veterans' Act  to protect  reemployment\r\n\nrights \r                  in \r                    former \r                           military positions.

The question has  arisen\r\n\nwhether  this technician  position  is  protected  under  the\r\n\nVeterans' \r                     Act \r                        after \r                              active duty ends.  One district court ruled\r\n\nin \r              favor \r                    of \r                       coverage, although it assumed rather than analyzed\r\n\nthe statutory-coverage issue,  and several other courts  have\r\n\n                            -13-\r                                        -13-\r\r\n\nbeen willing to assume such coverage          in denying  th\r\n\ntechnician's reemployment protection on other grounds.2\r\n\n     H\r                                                 arguendo               e\r                  ow \r                    this \r                         court \r                              would \r                                    decide such a case is unclear.  There\r\n\nis  language  in  Wright v.

On  the  other  hand,  a  passing\r\n\nreference in the new reemployment statute that has supplanted\r\n\nthe Veterans'  Act may give  some support  to National  Guard\r\n\ntechnicians who claim reemployment protection.  See 38 U.S.C.\r\n\nS 4304(4)(B);  see also H.R. Rep.

In this  respect, they  are\r\n\narguably protected  under the  Veterans' Act  like any  other\r\n\ncivilian \r                    employees \r                              of \r                                a \r                                  federal or state military organization.\r\n\nThe difficulty,  where such  civilian positions  are tied  to\r\n\nmembership in the National Guard, is that reinstatement would\r\n\nrequire either that the  military tie-in be waived or that  a\r\n\n     2See Witter v.

The plaintiffs' only status was as \"full-time\r\n\nNational Guard\" members assigned, under a state plan approved\r\n\nby the Secretary of Defense, to work under military orders in\r\n\nthe drug interdiction program.  Even assuming that this court\r\n\nmight \r                 follow \r                        Witter\r                              \r                              and \r                                  extend protection to technicians--which\r\n\nis far from clear--this would not affect our decision in  the\r\n\npresent case  that the plaintiffs  are not  protected by  the\r\n\nVeterans' Act.\r\n\n      To \r                    this \r                         point, we have said little about the new federal\r\n\nstatute \r                   which, as of October 1994, supplants the Veterans' Act\r\n\nand provides  a  new  framework for  reemployment  rights  of\r\n\nveterans. \r                      \r                      This new statute does not apply to the present case\r\n\nand is not direct evidence of the intent of the Congress that\r\n\nenacted the Veterans' Act.  But the new statute is in certain\r\n\nrespects \r                    a \r                     reenactment \r                                 of the Veterans' Act in somewhat clearer\r\n\nlanguage, \r                     and \r                         it \r                           would \r                                 certainly be deserving of mention if the\r\n\nnew \r               version \r                      were \r                           strongly favorable either to the plaintiffs or\r\n\nthe defendants.\r\n\n                            -15-\r                                        -15-\r\r\n\n     The \r                    fact \r                         is \r                            that the new statute carries forward the same\r\n\nambiguity \r                     in \r                        literal language that afflicts the Veterans' Act.\r\n\nIt protects, subject to certain conditions, \"any person whose\r\n\nabsence \r                   from \r                        a \r                         position \r                                  of employment is necessitated by reason\r\n\nof service in the uniformed services . . . .\"  About the most\r\n\nto be said is  that the new statute provides that  \"full-time\r\n\nNational \r                    Guard duty\" is included in the definition of \"service\r\n\nin the uniformed services,\" 38 U.S.C.
