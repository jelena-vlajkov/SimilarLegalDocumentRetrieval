We  have carefully reviewed the record\n                    \n\nand  conclude   that   substantial  evidence   supports   the\n\nSecretary's determination that  claimant Felicita Ferrer Cruz\n\nretained the ability to perform a particular past job and was\n\nnot entitled to social security disability benefits.  We have\n\nconsidered  all of  claimant's  arguments  and, finding  them\n\nwithout  merit, affirm  the  judgment of  the district  court\n\nessentially  on  the basis  of the  magistrate-judge's report\n\nadopted by the district court.  We add only these comments.\n\n          While we agree with  claimant that the \"B\" criteria\n\nof  the Appeals  Council's psychiatric review  technique form\n\nshow a severe mental impairment,  the claimant failed to meet\n\nher relatively minimal initial burden to show both the mental\n\ndemands of her  former work  and how those  work duties  were\n\ncompromised by  her mental condition.   Santiago v. Secretary\n                                                             \n\nof Health &amp; Human Services. 944  F.2d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir.  1991)\n                          \n\n(\"[T]he  kind  of  foundation  that  the  claimant  must  lay\n\nrequires no more than putting into issue functional loss that\n\nprecludes  performance of pertinent prior work activities.\").\n\nBased  upon claimant's  description of  her previous  work as\n\nsecretary/receptionist at  a photo studio, it  is not obvious\n\nhow  her  mental condition,  a generalized  anxiety disorder,\n\nprecluded her prior work.  In addition, we note that although\n\nclaimant  filed an  application  alleging disability  due to,\n\ninter alia, \"nerves\",  there is no evidence that claimant was\n          \n\never  treated  or  followed   for  any  mental  or  emotional\n\ncondition.  Even  if we  were to conclude  that claimant  had\n\nsufficiently raised the issue of her inability to perform the\n\nactual mental  demands of her former job,  where no treatment\n\nwhatsoever was obtained, the ALJ  was entitled to decide that\n\nclaimant's  relatively mild  mental condition  only minimally\n\naffected  her  ability  to perform  her  self-described  work\n\nduties.   See, e.g., Irlanda  Ortiz v.
