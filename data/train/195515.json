Ronald  E.  Tilley,  a  pro  se  federal\n                                                    \n\nprisoner, appeals the district court's  denial of his Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 60(b)(6)  motion for relief  from the district  court\n\norder dismissing his  28 U.S.C.   2255 motion  to vacate, set\n\naside, or correct  his sentence.1  We review  denials of Rule\n\n60(b)  motions for abuse of discretion.  See Rodriguez-Antuna\n                                                             \n\nv. Chase Manhattan Bank Corp., 871 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1989).\n                            \n\nWe affirm the district court order. \n\n     \"It is settled  law in this circuit that  a motion which\n\nasks the  court to modify  its earlier disposition of  a case\n\nsolely because  of an  ostensibly erroneous  legal result  is\n\nbrought under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).  Such a motion,  without\n\nmore,  does not invoke  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 60(b). .  . . Absent\n\nfraud,  newly-discovered   evidence,  a   party's  pardonable\n\nomission,  or the  like --  none of  which  were meaningfully\n\nalleged --  [such a] motion must  be measured by the  Rule 59\n\nyardstick.\"    Rodriguez-Antuna   871  F.2d  at  2 (citations\n                               \n\nomitted).  Tilley alleges no grounds  which would entitle him\n\nto relief  under Rule 60(b).   His  sole basis for  relief is\n\nthat  the  district court  erred,  as  a  matter of  law,  in\n\nrefusing to give  retroactive effect to  a 1992 amendment  to\n\nU.S.S.G.   4A1.3,  p.s.   Consequently, the  motion should be\n\nviewed as a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment.\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  Federal Rules  of Civil  Procedure apply  to    2255\nproceedings.  Barrett v. United  States, 965 F.2d  1184, 1187\n                                       \nn.4 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n                             -2-\n\nSee Echevarria-Gonzalez  v. Gonzalez-Chapel, 849 F.2d  24, 26\n                                           \n\n(1st  Cir. 1988) (\"'nomenclature  should not be  exalted over\n\nsubstance.'\")  (quoting Lyell Theatre  Corp. v.  Loews Corp.,\n                                                            \n\n682 F.2d 37, 41 (2d Cir. 1982)). \n\n      Viewed  under  Rule  59(e),  Tilley's  motion  must  be\n\ndismissed as untimely filed.  Rule 59(e) requires a motion to\n\nalter  or amend  a judgment to  be \"served not  later than 10\n\ndays after  the entry of  the judgment.\"  The  district court\n\njudgment  denying Tilley's     2255  motion  was  entered  on\n\nDecember 22, 1993.  There is no indication in the record that\n\nthe so-called Rule  60(b) motion was ever  served.  Moreover,\n\nit was not filed with the court until January 18, 1994,  more\n\nthan  10 days,  after entry  of the  judgment.   The district\n\ncourt  therefore appropriately denied the motion. See  Vargas\n                                                             \n\nv. Gonzalez, 975 F.2d 916,  918 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that\n           \n\ndistrict court lacked  jurisdiction to grant untimely  motion\n\nthat sought relief that  could only be properly sought  under\n\nRule 59(e)); Barrett  v. United States,  965 F.2d 1184,  1187\n                                      \n\n(1st   Cir.  1992)   (affirming  dismissal  of   motions  for\n\nreconsideration of  dismissal of    2255  petition on  ground\n\nthat motions, viewed  as Rule 59(e) motions,  were untimely).\n\nSince the  Rule 59(e) motion  was untimely filed, it  did not\n\ntoll  the  time  for  filing  a notice  of  appeal  from  the\n\nunderlying  order dismissing  Tilley's    2255  motion.   See\n                                                             \n\nVargaz v. Gonzalez, 975 F.2d at 918.   \n                  \n\n                             -3-\n\n     Finally,  given that  the district  court  was under  no\n\nobligation to alter or amend  the judgment, its denial of the\n\nmotion  to  reconsider   did  not  constitute  an   abuse  of\n\ndiscretion.  The  district court order dismissing  the motion\n\nfor relief from judgment is therefore affirmed.\n                                              \n\n                             -4-\n",
