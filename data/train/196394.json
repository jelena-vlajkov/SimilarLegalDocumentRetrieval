Following a jury verdict finding the defendant, Jay A.\r\n\nPritzker,  liable to  his  erstwhile partner,  plaintiff Paul  S.\r\n\nDopp,  in the sum of  $2,000,000, the district  court disposed of\r\n\nseveral post-trial motions.  See Dopp  v. HTP Corp., 755 F. Supp.\r                                                             \r\n\n491  (D.P.R. 1991) (Dopp I).   On appeal, we upheld the liability\r                                    \r\n\nverdict  but vacated both the  jury's damage award  and the trial\r\n\ncourt's rulings in connection with equitable relief.  See Dopp v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nHTP Corp., 947 F.2d 506 (1st  Cir. 1991) (Dopp II).  The district\r                                                           \r\n\ncourt  then   conducted  a  second  trial   to  determine  Dopp's\r\n\nentitlement to various  forms of  redress.  The  jury returned  a\r\n\nseries  of special  findings  and the  district  court entered  a\r\n\nrevised  judgment.   See  Dopp v.  HTP  Corp., 831  F.  Supp. 939\r                                                       \r\n\n(D.P.R. 1993) (Dopp III).\r                                 \r\n\n          Both sides expressed dismay  with the revised judgment.\r\n\nAfter  hearing  a gaggle  of  appeals, we  affirmed  the district\r\n\ncourt's  denial of a resultory remedy; upheld the jury's award of\r\n\nfull damages  (originally,  $17,000,000) on  condition  that  the\r\n\nplaintiff remit  the excess  over $14,171,962; ordered  a limited\r\n\nnew trial absent a  remittitur; and set aside the  sanctions that\r\n\nthe  district court had imposed  pursuant to P.R.  Laws Ann. tit.\r\n\n32, app. III, R.44.1(d) &amp; 44.3(b) (1984 &amp; Supp. 1989).   See Dopp\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  Pritzker, 38  F.3d 1239  (1st  Cir. 1994)  (Dopp IV).   These\r                                                                 \r\n\nrulings necessitated a remand.\r\n\n          Our  warning that  this  seemingly  endless  litigation\r\n\nshowed signs of having \"taken on a life of its own,\" id. at 1255,\r                                                                  \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nproved prophetic.   When  the  parties returned  to the  district\r\n\ncourt, the wrangling continued.  Judge Pieras issued a battery of\r\n\norders in an  effort to close  the case.   Dopp now appeals.   He\r\n\nstrikes  six  separate  chords.   We  write  somewhat  sparingly,\r\n\nconfident that the reader  who hungers for more detail  will find\r\n\nno shortage of it in earlier opinions.\r\n\n          First:  On remand, Dopp beseeched the district court to\r                    First:\r                         \r\n\nadd  prejudgment interest to the damage award.  The court refused\r\n\nto do so.  Dopp assigns error.  We see none.\r\n\n          This is \"a diversity case in which the substantive  law\r\n\nof Puerto Rico supplies the basis of decision.\"  Dopp IV, 38 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\nat 1252.  Thus, a federal  court must give effect to Rule 44.3(b)\r\n\nof the Puerto Rico Rules of Civil Procedure.  Under that rule, if\r\n\na  plaintiff  recovers  money  damages and  the  court  finds the\r\n\ndefendant to have been  guilty of obstinacy, the court  must then\r\n\nadd prejudgment  interest to the verdict.   See id.; see  also De\r                                                                           \r\n\nLeon Lopez v. Corporacion  Insular de Seguros, 931 F.2d  116, 126\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1991); Fernandez v. San Juan Cement Co., 118 P.R. Dec.\r                                                            \r\n\n713 (1987).\r\n\n          Here,  however, there  is  no basis  for  a finding  of\r\n\nobstinacy.  See Dopp IV, 38  F.3d at 1253-55.  Accordingly,  when\r                                 \r\n\nDopp, in the  aftermath of  our latest opinion,  asked the  lower\r\n\ncourt  to add prejudgment interest, the court demurred.  It ruled\r\n\nthat,  absent  obstinacy,  Puerto  Rico law  furnished  no  other\r\n\nvehicle  by  which a  court     as opposed  to  a  jury or  other\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nfactfinder    could impose prejudgment interest in a case of this\r\n\ngenre.1   We  agree:   where  prejudgment  interest is  available\r\n\nunder  Puerto Rico  law,  the Civil  Code expressly  so provides.\r\n\nSee, e.g., P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,    3025, 3514;  P.R.R. Civ. P.\r                   \r\n\n44.3(b).   Here, Dopp points  to no  provision in the  Civil Code\r\n\nauthorizing the  add-on that he  seeks.  The absence  of any such\r\n\nprovision is, as the  district court recognized, fatal  to Dopp's\r\n\nclaim.\r\n\n          Second:   In  a related  vein, Dopp  contends that  the\r                    Second:\r                          \r\n\ndistrict court should  have acted  ex cathedra, as  it were,  and\r                                                        \r\n\nincreased  the dollar amount of  the verdict to  reflect delay in\r\n\npayment.  This contention is triply flawed.\r\n\n          In the  first place, Dopp rests  his argument primarily\r\n\non a  statute that he  did not  mention below.2   Yet, \"[i]f  any\r\n\nprinciple is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most\r\n\nextraordinary circumstances, legal  theories not raised  squarely\r\n\nin  the lower  court  cannot be  broached for  the first  time on\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1At  the  time  of  the  second  trial,  the  jury  was  not\r\ninstructed to consider  the time value of money as  an element of\r\nDopp's damages, and  Dopp did  not preserve an  objection to  the\r\nomission of such  an instruction.  He  has, therefore, foreclosed\r\nthat avenue.  See Toscano v. Chandris, S.A., 934 F.2d 383, 384-85\r                                                     \r\n(1st Cir. 1991).\r\n\n     2The  statute,  P.R. Laws  Ann. tit.  31,    7,  provides in\r\npertinent part:\r\n\n               When there is  no statute applicable  to\r\n          the case at issue,  the court shall decide in\r\n          accordance  with  equity,  which  means  that\r\n          natural justice, as  embodied in the  general\r\n          principles of jurisprudence  and in  accepted\r\n          and established usages and customs,  shall be\r\n          taken into consideration.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nappeal.\"   Teamsters, Chauffeurs,  Warehousemen &amp;  Helpers Union,\r                                                                           \r\n\nLocal No.  59 v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.\r                                                \r\n\n1992).  The  circumstances here are not out of  the ordinary.  To\r\n\nseal the  bargain, Dopp  offered no  argumentation based on  this\r\n\nstatute in his opening appellate brief.   It is hornbook law that\r\n\nan argument omitted from  an appellant's opening brief is  deemed\r\n\nwaived, notwithstanding its belated emergence in the reply brief.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Sandstrom v. Chemlawn Corp., 904 F.2d 83, 87 (1st Cir.\r                                                \r\n\n1990).\r\n\n          In the second place, this argument is barred by the so-\r\n\ncalled mandate  rule.  In  attempting to sustain  the $17,000,000\r\n\ndamage award, Dopp asserted a variety of theories that he claimed\r\n\njustified the higher award.  See Dopp IV, 38 F.3d at 1248-51.  We\r                                                  \r\n\nrejected his  asseverations.   Under  the  mandate rule     which\r\n\nprovides in substance that \"[a] decision of an appellate tribunal\r\n\non a particular issue,  unless vacated or set aside,  governs the\r\n\nissue  during all  subsequent stages  of  litigation in  the nisi\r\n\nprius court, and thereafter on any further appeal,\" United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

The bar  erected by  the mandate rule  remains firm\r\n\ndespite the fact that a party, the second time around, drapes his\r\n\ncontention in  slightly  different garb.

The first, Rojas v.\r                                                                        \r\nMaldonado, 68 P.R. 757 (1948), is a wrongful death action dealing\r                   \r\nwith  the  measurement and  translation  of  a bereaved  parent's\r\nsuffering into money  damages.   The case has  no application  to\r\ncontract  damages (which,  under  Puerto  Rico  law,  are  to  be\r\nmeasured as of the date of the actionable breach).  Dopp's second\r\noffering,  Suro v. E.L.A.,  111 P.R. Dec.  564 (1981),  is also a\r                                   \r\nwrongful death action.  It deals with how a court  should measure\r\na  decedent's lost future earnings.   See id.  at 569-70, 574-75.\r                                                       \r\nThe Suro opinion has no relevance to the issue at hand.\r                  \r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nanother trial or he could accept the remittitur and have judgment\r\n\nentered in  the reduced amount.   The district  court supportably\r\n\nfound  that  Dopp elected  the latter  course.   This  finding is\r\n\nreviewable  only for abuse of discretion.  See De Leon Lopez, 931\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at  120 n.3.   Given Dopp's  serial filings in  the district\r\n\ncourt, we discern no hint of  abuse either in the finding that he\r\n\nelected the remittitur or in the timing of his election.\r\n\n          Fourth:    Money  judgments in  federal  civil  actions\r                    Fourth:\r                          \r\n\nordinarily carry postjudgment interest  until paid, see 28 U.S.C.\r                                                                 \r\n\n  1961(a),4  and the parties    who agree on little  else   agree\r\n\nthat  this   case  comes  within   the  statute's  sweep.     Not\r\n\nsurprisingly,  there is a rub:   Dopp seeks postjudgment interest\r\n\non the first  $2,000,000 in  damages not from  December 13,  1993\r\n\n(the date on  which the  district court entered  judgment on  the\r\n\nmore  recent jury verdict) but  from March 23,  1990 (the date on\r\n\nwhich the district  court entered  judgment on  the initial  jury\r\n\nverdict).  He has no such entitlement.\r\n\n          The relevant  facts are  as follows.   The  first trial\r\n\nresulted  in a jury verdict of $2,000,000, and the district court\r\n\nentered judgment in that amount.  We vacated the judgment  in all\r\n\n\"its relief-related  aspects.\"   Dopp II, 947  F.2d at 520.

Dopp theorizes\r\n\nthat postjudgment interest should  accrue on the first $2,000,000\r\n\nin damages from the date of the vacated judgment rather than from\r\n\nthe  date of the larger  judgment that was  entered following the\r\n\nsecond  jury verdict.    For his  part,  Pritzker maintains  that\r\n\npostjudgment interest should run only from the latter date.\r\n\n          The premier authority  on this point is Kaiser  Alum. &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nChem.  Corp.  v.  Bonjorno, 494  U.S.  827  (1990).   In  Kaiser,\r                                                                          \r\n\nfollowing a jury  verdict for the  plaintiff, the district  court\r\n\ngranted the defendant's  motion for  a new trial  limited to  the\r\n\nissue of damages on the ground that the evidence did not  support\r\n\nthe  award.   The  second trial  produced  a larger  verdict that\r\n\nproved impervious to appellate review.  Interpreting  28 U.S.C.  \r\n\n1961(a),  see supra  note  4, the  Supreme  Court concluded  that\r                             \r\n\npostjudgment interest  on the  entire award should  be calculated\r\n\nfrom the entry of the second judgment.  The  Court reasoned that,\r\n\nwhen  a damage  award  is \"not  supported  by the  evidence,  the\r\n\ndamages have not been ascertained in any meaningful way.\"  Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n836.  In such circumstances,  \"[i]t would be counterintuitive, to\r\n\nsay  the least,  to believe  that Congress  intended postjudgment\r\n\ninterest to be calculated from such a judgment.\"  Id.\r                                                               \r\n\n          Kaiser  controls  here.    The first  trial  yielded  a\r                          \r\n\nverdict  from which we found it \"[i]mpossible  . . . to determine\r\n\nwhat sort of damages the jurors thought they were awarding or how\r\n\nthey arrived at the  stated figure of $2,000,000.\"   Dopp II, 947\r                                                                      \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nF.2d at  513.   In other words,  the judgment,  like the  current\r\n\ncrush of  tabloid stories recounting Elvis  sightings, lacked any\r\n\nvisible means  of support.   These indicia are  characteristic of\r\n\ncases in  which postjudgment  interest can  only accrue from  the\r\n\ndate of the second judgment.  See Cordero v. De Jesus-Mendez, 922\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  11, 16  (1st Cir.  1990) (explaining  that, when  the first\r\n\njudgment is not  \"basically sound\" and  \"lacks an evidentiary  or\r\n\nlegal basis,\" postjudgment interest should run only from the date\r\n\nof the second judgment).\r\n\n          We  need  not  beat  this  drum  incessantly.    As  we\r\n\nindicated at the  time, the  first judgment was  so riddled  with\r\n\nuncertainty  that we  could  not \"decipher  the character  of the\r\n\ndamage  award.\"   Dopp II,  947 F.2d  at 514.   We  confessed our\r                                   \r\n\ninability  to  divine  whether  the  sum  awarded   by  the  jury\r\n\nrepresented full or accessory damages; what election of remedies,\r\n\nif  any, the  plaintiff had  made; and  the extent  to which  the\r\n\nverdict represented inconsistent or duplicative remediation.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid.  at 515-16.    The  lack of  clarity  that marked  the  first\r             \r\n\njudgment,   coupled  with   our   determination  that   all   the\r\n\nparticipants had  a hand in producing the  chaos, see id. at 516,\r                                                                   \r\n\nsuggests that  the damages were  not ascertained in  a meaningful\r\n\nway in March  of 1990.   One simply cannot  say on this  scumbled\r\n\nrecord either that the evidence supported the initial judgment on\r\n\ndamages  or that the second  judgment was a  mere modification of\r\n\nthe first.\r\n\n          Dopp seeks to avoid this result by reliance upon Bailey\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nv.

Later,  with the  benefit of hindsight  informed by  a\r\n\nretrial, a  second appeal,  and countless legal  maneuverings, we\r\n\ncould  attempt to peel off the layers of litigation and return to\r\n\nthe starting place with some better inkling of what that long-ago\r\n\nverdict  might have  meant.   But reasoning  backward is  not our\r\n\nproper  function.    The hallmarks  of  the  first judgment  were\r\n\nambiguity  and  uncertainty,  and   Dopp  has  not  produced  any\r\n\ndependable means  of dispelling  the mist.   Because  the damages\r\n\nwere not ascertained  in any  meaningful way by  the first  jury,\r\n\npostjudgment  interest runs  only  from the  date  of the  second\r\n\njudgment.\r\n\n          Fifth:     Dopp's  next  point  implicates  his  former\r                    Fifth:\r                         \r\n\ncounsel, the law firm of  Ledesma, Palou &amp; Miranda (LP&amp;M).

Under the Agreement, LP&amp;M was to receive\r\n\n25%  of \"all amounts recovered\" in the litigation.  Following the\r\n\nsecond jury  verdict, the district court indicated  that, if Dopp\r\n\nelected  full damages as his  anodyne of choice,  the court might\r\n\n\"enter a  Judgment which will  include the payment  of attorneys'\r\n\nfees to [LP&amp;M].\"   Dopp III, 831  F.

Although this suggestion  slipped from  sight\r             \r\n\nduring the ensuing appeal,  it proved to be a harbinger of things\r\n\nto come.\r\n\n          We issued our opinion  in Dopp IV on October  28, 1994.\r                                                     \r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nA petition  for rehearing  consumed  some additional  time.   Our\r\n\nmandate then issued.   On February 10, 1995, Dopp,  through LP&amp;M,\r\n\nfiled a motion in the district court.  In it, he acknowledged the\r\n\nlid that  this court  had placed  on full damages  ($14,171,962),\r\n\ncalculated the portion of the award that Pritzker was entitled to\r\n\nextinguish by  reason of  certain litigated credits,6  and prayed\r\n\nthat the district court order immediate payment of the net amount\r\n\nremaining.    The  motion  included,  as  part  of  an  intricate\r\n\nexplanation  concerning  how  best  to  calculate  the  litigated\r\n\ncredits, a line  item in the amount  of $3,542,990.50    a figure\r\n\nequal to 25%  of the  reduced award  of full  damages    labelled\r\n\n\"Ledesma,  Palou &amp;  Miranda.\"   On March  10, 1995,  the district\r\n\ncourt  entered  a  final  judgment  which,  among  other  things,\r\n\npurported  to deduct  $3,542,990.50 from  Dopp's recovery  and to\r\n\nredirect that amount to LP&amp;M.\r\n\n          In the meantime, trouble erupted in paradise.  On March\r\n\n14, LP&amp;M, despite  having done  yeoman work for  Dopp, moved  for\r\n\nleave  to  withdraw  as  his  counsel.    Dopp,  acting  pro  se,\r\n\nsimultaneously  filed a  pleading signifying  his desire  to drop\r\n\nseveral pending  motions  (including  the  motion  for  immediate\r\n\npayment).  The district court granted LP&amp;M's motion  to withdraw,\r\n\nbut  denied Dopp's  omnibus pleading  as moot,  stating  that the\r\n\nMarch 10 judgment \"addressed all pending issues.\"\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6We  discussed  the  complicated  questions  surrounding the\r\nlitigated credit issue  at some  length in Pritzker  v.

It  would  serve no  useful  purpose to  rehearse  that\r\ndiscussion here.\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\n          Dopp assigns error to the portion of the final judgment\r\n\nthat earmarks funds  for LP&amp;M.   In his  view, the direction  for\r\n\npayment  is unconstitutional because LP&amp;M  is not a  party to the\r\n\naction, and any  judgment purportably rendered  for or against  a\r\n\nnon-party is void.\r\n\n          We  need not  probe this  point too  deeply.   The fees\r\n\nclaimed  by LP&amp;M are hotly disputed (earlier this year, LP&amp;M sued\r\n\nDopp for payment  in a  separate suit that  is currently  pending\r\n\nbefore  a different judge of the district court), the court below\r\n\nmade no  findings to  underbrace  the direction  for payment  (we\r\n\ncannot tell, for example, what the court knew of the fee dispute,\r\n\nor the basis on which it resolved any controversy), and the court\r\n\noffered  no rationale  for its  order.7   Moreover, LP&amp;M  has not\r\n\nintervened  in  this  action  and  the  district  court  has  not\r\n\nappropriately asserted in personam jurisdiction over it.\r                                            \r\n\n          These  omissions cast  a pall  over the  court's order.\r\n\nThe tenet is that remand is required when a district court offers\r\n\nno explanation  of a ruling, makes no findings, and the basis for\r\n\nthe ruling cannot confidently be discerned on appeal.

Fair, 859 F.2d  1059, 1066 (1st  Cir. 1988)\r                                    \r\n\n(warning  that,  without  any  explication  of  a  trial  judge's\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7It  is possible,  of course,  that Dopp lured  the district\r\ncourt  into following this course  by inserting the  line item in\r\nhis motion for payment.  See supra p. 12.   Even if this were so,\r                                            \r\nhowever, we would  not find  an estoppel because  the motion  for\r\npayment was  crafted  by the  beneficiary  of the  direction  for\r\npayment, LP&amp;M, then acting as Dopp's counsel.\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nreasoning, the court of appeals is \"sometimes forced to remand in\r\n\norder to apprehend  the basis  for decision below\").   Here at  a\r\n\nbare  minimum,   several  things   must  happen  before   we  can\r\n\nintelligently review the propriety  of the direction for payment.\r\n\nFirst, the law  firm must  intervene in the  action or  otherwise\r\n\nassert a  claim of right  to a portion  of the judgment  (say, by\r\n\ngarnishment  or impressment  of a  lien).   Second, Dopp  must be\r\n\ngiven notice  and  an  opportunity  to  contest  the  law  firm's\r\n\nclaim.8  If, after  these two things have been  accomplished, the\r\n\ncourt concludes that a  direction for payment is proper,  it must\r\n\nset forth  specific findings  and elucidate its  ratio decidendi.\r                                                                          \r\n\nSince none of these essential ingredients have yet been prepared,\r\n\nwe  vacate the direction for  payment and remand  to the district\r\n\ncourt for further proceedings limited to that issue.9\r\n\n          Sixth:  Last and  least, Dopp asks us to  pass upon the\r                    Sixth:\r                         \r\n\nbill of costs he submitted below.   Because the district court to\r\n\nour  knowledge  has not  yet  addressed  that submission,  Dopp's\r\n\nrequest  to this  court is premature.   See Mason  v. Belieu, 543\r                                                                      \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8We take no position on the  merits of the fee dispute or on\r\nthe degree to which that dispute may or may not be susceptible to\r\nresolution within the four corners of the instant case.\r\n\n     9Although the size of LP&amp;M's fee arguably affects the amount\r\nof at  least one  litigated credit  and, thus, could  conceivably\r\nhave  an impact on Pritzker's  net payment to  Dopp, Pritzker did\r\nnot  cross-appeal either from  the trial court's  allocation of a\r\nsum  certain to  LP&amp;M or  from its  computation of  the litigated\r\ncredits.    Before  us,  Pritzker maintains  the  same  hands-off\r\nattitude, stating  that he \"takes  no position in  th[e] dispute\"\r\nover the propriety of including LP&amp;M  within the judgment proper.\r\nAppellee's Brief at 15 n.8.  Thus, on remand, the  district court\r\nneed not  consider Pritzker's interests in  its further treatment\r\nof this issue.\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nF.2d 215, 222 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 852 (1976).\r                                                 \r\n\n          We need go no  further.  The district court did not err\r\n\nin  determining  that the  award of  full  damages, as  capped on\r\n\nappeal, should not  be augmented by  the addition of  prejudgment\r\n\ninterest or  enhanced to reflect the  delay in payment.   Nor did\r\n\nthe court err in determining that the plaintiff made  a valid and\r\n\nbinding  election to  accept the  remedy of  full damages  and to\r\n\nremit the excess of  the award over $14,171,962.   We, therefore,\r\n\naffirm the court's rulings in these respects.  At the  same time,\r\n\nwe direct that postjudgment interest on the reduced award  should\r\n\naccrue, at the federal  statutory rate, see 28 U.S.C.    1961(a),\r                                                     \r\n\nfrom  December 13, 1993.  Finally, we vacate the judgment insofar\r\n\nas  it  calls  for Pritzker  to  pay  a portion  of  the proceeds\r\n\ndirectly to LP&amp;M, and we remand for further proceedings solely in\r\n\nregard to  that aspect of the  matter.  Costs on  appeal shall be\r\n\ntaxed in favor of the appellee.\r\n\nIt is so ordered.\r          It is so ordered.\r                          \r\n\n                                16\r\r\n",

Accordingly,  when\r                                 \r\n\nDopp, in the  aftermath of  our latest opinion,  asked the  lower\r\n\ncourt  to add prejudgment interest, the court demurred.  It ruled\r\n\nthat,  absent  obstinacy,  Puerto  Rico law  furnished  no  other\r\n\nvehicle  by  which a  court     as opposed  to  a  jury or  other\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nfactfinder    could impose prejudgment interest in a case of this\r\n\ngenre.1   We  agree:   where  prejudgment  interest is  available\r\n\nunder  Puerto Rico  law,  the Civil  Code expressly  so provides.\r\n\nSee, e.g., P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,    3025, 3514;  P.R.R. Civ. P.\r                   \r\n\n44.3(b).   Here, Dopp points  to no  provision in the  Civil Code\r\n\nauthorizing the  add-on that he  seeks.  The absence  of any such\r\n\nprovision is, as the  district court recognized, fatal  to Dopp's\r\n\nclaim.\r\n\n          Second:   In  a related  vein, Dopp  contends that  the\r                    Second:\r                          \r\n\ndistrict court should  have acted  ex cathedra, as  it were,  and\r                                                        \r\n\nincreased  the dollar amount of  the verdict to  reflect delay in\r\n\npayment.  This contention is triply flawed.\r\n\n          In the  first place, Dopp rests  his argument primarily\r\n\non a  statute that he  did not  mention below.2   Yet, \"[i]f  any\r\n\nprinciple is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most\r\n\nextraordinary circumstances, legal  theories not raised  squarely\r\n\nin  the lower  court  cannot be  broached for  the first  time on\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1At  the  time  of  the  second  trial,  the  jury  was  not\r\ninstructed to consider  the time value of money as  an element of\r\nDopp's damages, and  Dopp did  not preserve an  objection to  the\r\nomission of such  an instruction.

But reasoning  backward is  not our\r\n\nproper  function.    The hallmarks  of  the  first judgment  were\r\n\nambiguity  and  uncertainty,  and   Dopp  has  not  produced  any\r\n\ndependable means  of dispelling  the mist.

Although this suggestion  slipped from  sight\r             \r\n\nduring the ensuing appeal,  it proved to be a harbinger of things\r\n\nto come.\r\n\n          We issued our opinion  in Dopp IV on October  28, 1994.\r                                                     \r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nA petition  for rehearing  consumed  some additional  time.   Our\r\n\nmandate then issued.   On February 10, 1995, Dopp,  through LP&amp;M,\r\n\nfiled a motion in the district court.  In it, he acknowledged the\r\n\nlid that  this court  had placed  on full damages  ($14,171,962),\r\n\ncalculated the portion of the award that Pritzker was entitled to\r\n\nextinguish by  reason of  certain litigated credits,6  and prayed\r\n\nthat the district court order immediate payment of the net amount\r\n\nremaining.    The  motion  included,  as  part  of  an  intricate\r\n\nexplanation  concerning  how  best  to  calculate  the  litigated\r\n\ncredits, a line  item in the amount  of $3,542,990.50    a figure\r\n\nequal to 25%  of the  reduced award  of full  damages    labelled\r\n\n\"Ledesma,  Palou &amp;  Miranda.\"   On March  10, 1995,  the district\r\n\ncourt  entered  a  final  judgment  which,  among  other  things,\r\n\npurported  to deduct  $3,542,990.50 from  Dopp's recovery  and to\r\n\nredirect that amount to LP&amp;M.\r\n\n          In the meantime, trouble erupted in paradise.  On March\r\n\n14, LP&amp;M, despite  having done  yeoman work for  Dopp, moved  for\r\n\nleave  to  withdraw  as  his  counsel.    Dopp,  acting  pro  se,\r\n\nsimultaneously  filed a  pleading signifying  his desire  to drop\r\n\nseveral pending  motions  (including  the  motion  for  immediate\r\n\npayment).  The district court granted LP&amp;M's motion  to withdraw,\r\n\nbut  denied Dopp's  omnibus pleading  as moot,  stating  that the\r\n\nMarch 10 judgment \"addressed all pending issues.\"\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6We  discussed  the  complicated  questions  surrounding the\r\nlitigated credit issue  at some  length in Pritzker  v.

It  would  serve no  useful  purpose to  rehearse  that\r\ndiscussion here.\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\n          Dopp assigns error to the portion of the final judgment\r\n\nthat earmarks funds  for LP&amp;M.   In his  view, the direction  for\r\n\npayment  is unconstitutional because LP&amp;M  is not a  party to the\r\n\naction, and any  judgment purportably rendered  for or against  a\r\n\nnon-party is void.\r\n\n          We  need not  probe this  point too  deeply.   The fees\r\n\nclaimed  by LP&amp;M are hotly disputed (earlier this year, LP&amp;M sued\r\n\nDopp for payment  in a  separate suit that  is currently  pending\r\n\nbefore  a different judge of the district court), the court below\r\n\nmade no  findings to  underbrace  the direction  for payment  (we\r\n\ncannot tell, for example, what the court knew of the fee dispute,\r\n\nor the basis on which it resolved any controversy), and the court\r\n\noffered  no rationale  for its  order.7   Moreover, LP&amp;M  has not\r\n\nintervened  in  this  action  and  the  district  court  has  not\r\n\nappropriately asserted in personam jurisdiction over it.\r                                            \r\n\n          These  omissions cast  a pall  over the  court's order.\r\n\nThe tenet is that remand is required when a district court offers\r\n\nno explanation  of a ruling, makes no findings, and the basis for\r\n\nthe ruling cannot confidently be discerned on appeal.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nPearson v.

See supra p. 12.   Even if this were so,\r                                            \r\nhowever, we would  not find  an estoppel because  the motion  for\r\npayment was  crafted  by the  beneficiary  of the  direction  for\r\npayment, LP&amp;M, then acting as Dopp's counsel.\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nreasoning, the court of appeals is \"sometimes forced to remand in\r\n\norder to apprehend  the basis  for decision below\").   Here at  a\r\n\nbare  minimum,   several  things   must  happen  before   we  can\r\n\nintelligently review the propriety  of the direction for payment.\r\n\nFirst, the law  firm must  intervene in the  action or  otherwise\r\n\nassert a  claim of right  to a portion  of the judgment  (say, by\r\n\ngarnishment  or impressment  of a  lien).   Second, Dopp  must be\r\n\ngiven notice  and  an  opportunity  to  contest  the  law  firm's\r\n\nclaim.8  If, after  these two things have been  accomplished, the\r\n\ncourt concludes that a  direction for payment is proper,  it must\r\n\nset forth  specific findings  and elucidate its  ratio decidendi.\r                                                                          \r\n\nSince none of these essential ingredients have yet been prepared,\r\n\nwe  vacate the direction for  payment and remand  to the district\r\n\ncourt for further proceedings limited to that issue.9\r\n\n          Sixth:  Last and  least, Dopp asks us to  pass upon the\r                    Sixth:\r                         \r\n\nbill of costs he submitted below.   Because the district court to\r\n\nour  knowledge  has not  yet  addressed  that submission,  Dopp's\r\n\nrequest  to this  court is premature.   See Mason  v. Belieu, 543\r                                                                      \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8We take no position on the  merits of the fee dispute or on\r\nthe degree to which that dispute may or may not be susceptible to\r\nresolution within the four corners of the instant case.\r\n\n     9Although the size of LP&amp;M's fee arguably affects the amount\r\nof at  least one  litigated credit  and, thus, could  conceivably\r\nhave  an impact on Pritzker's  net payment to  Dopp, Pritzker did\r\nnot  cross-appeal either from  the trial court's  allocation of a\r\nsum  certain to  LP&amp;M or  from its  computation of  the litigated\r\ncredits.    Before  us,  Pritzker maintains  the  same  hands-off\r\nattitude, stating  that he \"takes  no position in  th[e] dispute\"\r\nover the propriety of including LP&amp;M  within the judgment proper.\r\nAppellee's Brief at 15 n.8.  Thus, on remand, the  district court\r\nneed not  consider Pritzker's interests in  its further treatment\r\nof this issue.\r\n\n                                </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span>\r\r\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 222 (D.C.

The district court did not err\r\n\nin  determining  that the  award of  full  damages, as  capped on\r\n\nappeal, should not  be augmented by  the addition of  prejudgment\r\n\ninterest or  enhanced to reflect the  delay in payment.   Nor did\r\n\nthe court err in determining that the plaintiff made  a valid and\r\n\nbinding  election to  accept the  remedy of  full damages  and to\r\n\nremit the excess of  the award over $14,171,962.   We, therefore,\r\n\naffirm the court's rulings in these respects.  At the  same time,\r\n\nwe direct that postjudgment interest on the reduced award  should\r\n\naccrue, at the federal  statutory rate, see 28 U.S.C.    1961(a),\r                                                     \r\n\nfrom  December 13, 1993.  Finally, we vacate the judgment insofar\r\n\nas  it  calls  for Pritzker  to  pay  a portion  of  the proceeds\r\n\ndirectly to LP&amp;M, and we remand for further proceedings solely in\r\n\nregard to  that aspect of the  matter.  Costs on  appeal shall be\r\n\ntaxed in favor of the appellee.\r\n\nIt is so ordered.\r          It is so ordered.\r                          \r\n\n                                16\r\r\n</pre>",
