Murphy, Jr. on brief pro se.\r                                  \nDarwin Molino on brief pro se.\r                         \n\n                                         \n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per Curiam.   Darwin Molino rented  a cabin from  a\r                                \n\ntrust of  which William J. Murphy,  Jr. is trustee.   After a\n\ndispute  about  Molino's  non-payment  of  rent,  the Bristol\n\nhousing  court  at  Murphy's  behest  issued  a  summons  and\n\ncomplaint  on December  20,  1993.   An attempted  settlement\n\nbroke down, and in May 1994, Molino sought  unsuccessfully to\n\ntransfer  the  pending  case  to  the  Massachusetts  Supreme\n\nJudicial Court.\n\n          When this  effort failed,  Molino on June  3, 1994,\n\nfiled a petition to remove the case to federal district court\n\nrelying  on federal  question jurisdiction,  see 28  U.S.C.  \r                                                            \n\n1441(c), and on a provision allowing removal by defendant who\n\nis denied or cannot  enforce in state court his  \"equal civil\n\nrights.\"   28 U.S.C.    1443(1).   Removal was improper.   No\n\nfederal  question  arises  on  the  face  of  the  complaint,\n\nOklahoma  Tax Commis. v. Graham, 489 U.S. 838 (1989); and the\r                                           \n\nequal rights provision relates to racial equality, Johnson v.\r                                                                      \n\nMississippi, 421  U.S.  213,  219  (1975),  whereas  Molino's\r                       \n\nconcern  is  with  a  supposed  violation of  his  \"right  to\n\nconfidentiality\" during a mediation proceeding.\n\n          On  July 29,  1994,  the  district court  dismissed\n\nMolino's removed  action for lack of  jurisdiction.  Judgment\n\nwas  entered on  August 1,  1994, and  Molino filed  a timely\n\nappeal.   Apparently after the dismissal  the Bristol housing\n\ncourt ordered the sheriff to take possession of the cabin and\r\r\n\nto  collect past rent, interest  and costs.   Molino sought a\n\ntemporary restraining order from the district  court, seeking\n\nto  prevent the  eviction.   The  district  court denied  the\n\nmotion.   On this appeal, Molino continues to insist that the\n\ndistrict court did  have jurisdiction over the  case and asks\n\nthat the housing court's writ to the sheriff be vacated.\n\n          Molino's  brief on  appeal is  a two-page  document\n\nthat  is mainly  a cross-reference  to appended  statutes and\n\nother  papers.  Despite  Molino's conclusory assertion, there\n\nis no basis for  believing that federal question jurisdiction\n\nexists in  the district court or that this is a case in which\n\nequal rights removal is justified.  If Molino were asking for\n\na remand rather than dismissal, he would arguably be entitled\n\nto that relief, see 28 U.S.C.    1447(c); Ronan v. Stone, 396\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d 502,  503 (1st Cir.  1968), but  apparently the  housing\n\ncourt is the last place he wants to be, and we have no reason\n\nto consider relief that Molino himself does not seek.\n\n          Molino's  more  interesting  argument is  that  the\n\nhousing court should not  have proceeded with the  case after\n\ndismissal by  the  district court  since  the case  had  been\n\nremoved, never remanded, and  apparently never refiled in the\n\nhousing  court.  If the  state court had  proceeded while the\n\ncase  was pending  in  federal district  court,  it would  be\n\nacting  contrary to  the  district court's  plenary authority\n\nover the removed  action, and the district court would indeed\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nhave  had  authority to  protect its  own jurisdiction.   See\r                                                                         \n\ngenerally  Hyde Park Partners, L.P. v. Connolly, 839 F.2d 842\r                                                           \n\n(1st Cir. 1988).  But here the housing court apparently acted\n\nonly  after  the federal  court  had dismissed  the  case and\n\nrelinquished authority over it.\n\n          Whether the housing court  should have required the\n\npapers to be refiled by  Murphy is a matter of state law.  If\n\nthere was any error  in the manner in  which the state  court\n\nreassumed authority  over the case,  Molino was free  to seek\n\nreview  in the  state system.   This  court, however,  is not\n\nentitled  to engage collaterally  in review of  a state court\n\njudgment where  federal jurisdiction  has not been  infringed\n\nupon.  Rooker v. Fidelity Trust, 263 U.S. 413 (1923).\r                                           \n\n          We  affirm  the  judgment of  the  district  court.\r                                \n\nMolino's motion to expedite this appeal is dismissed as moot.\r                                                                \n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n",
