Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n                                                          \n\n                                             \n\n                              Before\n\n            Torruella, Selya, and Cyr, Circuit Judges.\n                                                     \n\n                                             \n\n     Daniel  S.

Weld, Assistant  United States Attorney,  with whom\n                  \nPaul M. Gagnon,  United States  Attorney, was on  brief, for  the\n              \nUnited States.\n\n                                             \n\n                                             \n\n          Per Curiam.   We have carefully reviewed  the record on\n          Per Curiam.\n                    \n\nappeal  and discern  no  breach by  the  government of  the  plea\n\nagreement between it and the defendant.  We likewise find no hint\n\nthat  the district court violated  the representations it made to\n\nthe defendant at the change-of-plea hearing.  Consequently, there\n\nis  no cognizable  basis  for  defendant's  request  that  he  be\n\npermitted to withdraw his guilty plea.\n\n          Defendant's  remaining assignments of  error pertain to\n\nthe imposition of  sentence.   The situation in  this respect  is\n\nclouded by two recent developments.  For one thing, the Probation\n\nOffice's  policy in  connection  with a  matter  material to  the\n\ncomputation of  drug quantity for purposes  of imposing mandatory\n\nminimum sentences has changed  significantly.  For another thing,\n\nthe Second Circuit decided United States v. Darmand, 3 F.3d 1578,\n                                                   \n\n1581  (2d Cir.  1993)  (holding that  \"[u]nlike the  [Sentencing]\n\nGuidelines, which require a  sentencing court to consider similar\n\nconduct in  setting a  sentence, the statutory  mandatory minimum\n\nsentences  of 21  U.S.C.    841(b)(1) apply  only to  the conduct\n\nwhich actually  result[s] in  a conviction under  that statute\").\n\nIf this case correctly states the law   a matter on which we take\n\nno view   it  may have substantial implications for  the duration\n\nof defendant's sentence.   Under these unusual circumstances, the\n\nparties  agreed at  oral argument  that these  developments merit\n\nfurther consideration; and that, in the interests of justice, the\n\nsentence  previously  imposed  should  be  expunged,  and  a  new\n\nsentencing  hearing convened.   We agree.   We, therefore, vacate\n\n                                2\n\nthe defendant's sentence and remand for resentencing.1\n\n          The   defendant's   conviction   is   affirmed.
