Petitioner, Vojtech  Kubec, a  native\n                    \n\nand citizen  of Czechoslovakia,  has filed this  petition for\n\nreview of  the decision of  the Board of  Immigration Appeals\n\n(BIA) denying his  application for political  asylum.  See  8\n                                                          \n\nU.S.C.   1158(a).  Petitioner also claims that the BIA abused\n\nits  discretion in  accepting  certain findings  made by  the\n\nimmigration  judge  concerning  the  present  nature  of  the\n\ngovernment in Czechoslovakia.\n\n                              I.\n                               \n\n          Petitioner   was   born    in   1961   in    Plzen,\n\nCzechoslovakia.  He attended school there and, at the time he\n\nleft Czechoslovakia in 1989, was working as a technician at a\n\nrecording  studio.   He  is  married  to another  citizen  of\n\nCzechoslovakia and  has one  child.   His mother,  father and\n\nsister still live in Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic).\n\n          Petitioner  entered  the United  States,  in August\n\n1989,  as  a  nonimmigrant   visitor  for  pleasure;  he  was\n\npermitted  to  remain here  until  February  1990.   However,\n\npetitioner  never  left  this  country.   As  a  result,  the\n\nImmigration  and Naturalization  Service issued  an order  to\n\nshow  cause  why  petitioner  should not  be  deported.    In\n\nresponse,  petitioner filed applications for political asylum\n\nand withholding of deportation.\n\n          A  deportation hearing  was  held on  May 6,  1991.\n\nPetitioner admitted  the facts  in the  show cause order  and\n\n                             -2-\n\nconceded deportability.   At  the conclusion of  the hearing,\n\nthe immigration  judge rendered  an oral decision;  he denied\n\nthe  applications for  political  asylum and  withholding  of\n\ndeportation.  The judge determined that petitioner had failed\n\nto demonstrate that  he would  be persecuted or  had a  well-\n\nfounded fear  of persecution  if returned  to Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe  immigration judge  did  grant  petitioner's request  for\n\nvoluntary departure in lieu  of deportation.  See 8  U.S.C.  \n                                                 \n\n1254(e)(1).   The BIA, in a short order, affirmed the judge's\n\ndecision.\n\n                             II.\n                               \n\n          The   administrative  consideration   of  political\n\nasylum   claims  involves   a  two-step   process:     (1)  a\n\ndetermination   of   statutory   eligibility;   and   (2)   a\n\ndiscretionary  decision  whether   to  grant  asylum.     See\n                                                             \n\nGebremichael  v. INS,  10 F.3d  28, 35  (1st Cir. 1993).   In\n                    \n\nrelation  to the first  step, petitioner bears  the burden of\n\nestablishing  that he  is a  \"refugee\" within the  meaning of\n\nSection 101(a)(42)  of the Immigration and Naturalization Act\n\n(the  Act).  See  8 C.F.R.    242.17(c)(4)(iii); Ravindran v.\n                                                          \n\nINS, 976  F.2d 754,  758 (1st  Cir. 1992);  Alvarez-Flores v.\n                                                          \n\nINS, 909 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1990).\n   \n\n          \"Refugee\" is defined,  in relevant  part,\n          as any  alien who is unwilling  or unable\n          to  return  to  his country  \"because  of\n          persecution  or  a  well-founded fear  of\n          persecution on account of race, religion,\n\n                             -3-\n\n          nationality,  membership in  a particular\n          social group, or political opinion.\"\n\nRavindran,   976   F.2d   at   758  (quoting   8   U.S.C.    \n         \n1101(a)(42)(A)).\n\n          To show  that he is a refugee,  petitioner can rely\n\non  past persecution  or  on a  well-founded  fear of  future\n\npersecution  on  the  basis  of  one  of  the   five  grounds\n\nenumerated in   1101(a)(42)(A).  See Gebremichael, 10 F.3d at\n                                                 \n\n3;   Ravindran,  976  F.2d  at  758.    The  fear  of  future\n              \n\npersecution standard  has both a subjective  and an objective\n\ncomponent.   Ravindran, 976 F.2d at  758; Alvarez-Flores, 909\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at  5.  That is, the fear must be genuine and petitioner\n\nmust  show  \"`credible,  direct, and  specific  evidence'\" of\n\nfacts that  would establish  the reasonableness of  his fear.\n\nRavindran, 976 F.2d at 758 (citation omitted).  We review the\n         \n\ndetermination  that petitioner  was not  a refugee  under the\n\nsubstantial evidence standard.  See Alvarez-Flores,  909 F.2d\n                                                  \n\nat 3.  Thus, we will affirm  the BIA's decision if \"supported\n\nby reasonable,  substantial, and  probative  evidence on  the\n\nrecord  considered  as a  whole. .  .  . \"    See 8  U.S.C.  \n                                                 \n\n1105a(a)(4).\n\n          Petitioner claims that  he has presented sufficient\n\nevidence, based  on the nature of his  political opinions, to\n\nestablish  a well-founded  fear  of persecution.   First,  he\n\nstates  that his  grandfather's mill  was confiscated  by the\n\ncommunist governmental  authorities in  1953  and that  these\n\n                             -4-\n\nauthorities imprisoned his grandfather  for four years.  This\n\npersecution,   petitioner   alleges,   resulted  in   limited\n\neducational  and  vocational  opportunities for  petitioner's\n\nmother, as  well as  for  the entire  family.   Specifically,\n\npetitioner refers to an  incident that occurred in 1987.   At\n\nthis  time,   petitioner  and  his  brother   approached  the\n\ngovernment about  starting their own business.   According to\n\npetitioner,  they  were  informed  that   membership  in  the\n\nCommunist Party  would  \"greatly\" improve  their  chances  of\n\nsuccess.\n\n          In determining that petitioner did not have a well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution,  the immigration judge relied on\n\nthe  change in  the  government in  Czechoslovakia since  the\n\noccurrence of the above events.\n\n               I   take    judicial   notice   that\n          Czechoslovakia, at the present time, is a\n          free  and  independent country.    I take\n          judicial notice that the Russian Army has\n          left the territory of  Czechoslovakia and\n          that  democratic  institutions have  been\n          instituted  in  Czechoslovakia  and  that\n          Czechoslovakia    has   an    independent\n          democratic  government  with   democratic\n          institutions  in  place since  the Soviet\n          Forces have left Czechoslovakia, and that\n          there  have been elections, and that free\n          elections   have   resulted  in   a  free\n          democratic government  being installed in\n          Czechoslovakia.\n\n          Petitioner objects to the \"judicial notice\"  by the\n\nimmigration judge of these  facts.  He argues that  the judge\n\nwent beyond  what is  \"commonly  acknowledged\" and,  instead,\n\n                             -5-\n\nexpressed  his  own, personal  opinion.   Further, petitioner\n\nclaims  that he  was not  given  a sufficient  opportunity to\n\nrebut this information.   However, petitioner failed to raise\n\nthese arguments in his brief in support of his appeal  to the\n\nBIA.  \"Issues not raised before  the [BIA] may not be  raised\n\nfor the  first  time  upon  judicial review  of  the  [BIA's]\n\ndecisions.\"  Ravindran,  976 F.2d at  761.  Thus,  petitioner\n                      \n\nhas  failed to  exhaust his  administrative remedies  and has\n\nwaived review of these issues.  See id.\n                                       \n\n          The basis  for the immigration  judge's findings is\n\nthe Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1990 of the\n                                                      \n\nDepartment of  State, admitted, without objection, as exhibit\n\n5 at the  hearing.  In  addition to the  facts stated by  the\n\njudge,   the   Country   Reports   provides   the   following\n                                \n\ninformation.   After the  elections in 1990,  legislation was\n\nenacted  which  provided for  the  rights  of assembly,  free\n\nspeech and  association.  All known  political prisoners were\n\nfreed and, in 1990, there were no reports of torture or other\n\ncruel,  or degrading,  punishments.   The Soviet  Ministry of\n\nInterior,  which had been  used as \"an  instrument to control\n\nthe  population,\"  was  abolished.   Limitations  on  private\n\nenterprises  were  removed  and  efforts are  being  made  to\n\nestablish a  market economy.   Individuals are  permitted to,\n\nand, in fact, do, express their political opinions and engage\n\nin criticism  of the  present government.   Finally, citizens\n\n                             -6-\n\nwho had left the country during the communist regime are free\n\nto return to Czechoslovakia.\n\n          In an effort to rebut this information,  petitioner\n\nopines   that   these    changes   are   only    superficial.\n\nSpecifically, he asserts that it  is likely that the previous\n\ncommunist officials still control the government, the economy\n\nand the local  bureaucracies.  Thus, he asserts, the \"day-to-\n\nday\" operation of governmental agencies is the same as it was\n\nunder the  Soviet regime.  Petitioner concludes that he still\n\nwould  be  prevented from  securing any  economic gain  if he\n\nreturned  and  that because  of  his anti-communist  beliefs,\n\nstill would be at a high risk of persecution.\n\n          He  also argues  that two letters  -- one  from his\n\nmother  and the other from a friend -- provide specific facts\n\nthat  should be credited over the  general conclusions of the\n\nCountry  Reports.  These letters,  admitted as exhibits 3 and\n                \n\n4, recite  that disorder prevails in  Czechoslovakia and that\n\nthe government  has not  changed.  Also,  petitioner's mother\n\nwrites  that incompetent  people  run  the  government,  that\n\ncriticism  is not  tolerated and  that if  individuals return\n\nfrom  the West,  they are  seen as  criminals and  become the\n\ntargets of witchhunts and vindictive acts.\n\n                             III.\n                                \n\n          Based  on the  above,  we cannot  say that  the BIA\n\nlacked a substantial basis  for its finding that petitioner's\n\n                             -7-\n\nfears  were  not well-founded.   Without  determining whether\n\npetitioner's allegations  even  amount to  \"persecution,\"  we\n\nnote that the  only evidence of specific acts on  the part of\n                                        \n\nthe government  occurred before  the change in  government in\n\n1990.      Petitioner's   family   continues   to   live   in\n\nCzechoslovakia  without  having  suffered  any  instances  of\n\npersecution.  Petitioner has  been allowed by the authorities\n\nto travel to  this country;  he also took  trips to  Hungary,\n\nGermany and  Yugoslavia.   While petitioner remained  in this\n\ncountry, his wife was freely permitted  to travel between the\n\nUnited   States   and   Czechoslovakia   with    no   adverse\n\nconsequences.\n\n          Petitioner's  testimony and the two letters contain\n\nonly  conclusory  statements  that  circumstances   have  not\n\nchanged.   The  general  references to  disorder  and to  the\n\nstatus of refugees returning  to Czechoslovakia from the West\n\nare not supported by particular incidents or names, dates and\n\nadditional relevant information.   This court and others have\n\nupheld the BIA's denial  of asylum claims in cases  where the\n\nevidence has been far more compelling.  See, e.g., Ravindran,\n                                                            \n\n976 F.2d at 759 (imprisonment of petitioner by government for\n\nthree  days,  search  of   family  home,  the  witnessing  by\n\npetitioner of random acts of  violence by the majority ethnic\n\ngroup and persecution of petitioner's uncle were insufficient\n\nto establish refugee status); Alvarez-Flores, 909 F.2d at 5-6\n                                            \n\n                             -8-\n\n(the detention of  petitioner, once by  the guerrillas in  El\n\nSalvador and  once by  the military, insufficient  to show  a\n\nwell-founded  fear  of  persecution).

In relation to the first step, petitioner bears the burden of establishing that he is a \"refugee\" within the meaning of Section 101(a)(42) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (the Act).

Ravindran, 976 F.2d at 758;   Alvarez-Flores, 909 F.2d at 5.  That is, the fear must be genuine and petitioner must show \" 'credible, direct, and specific evidence' \" of facts that would establish the reasonableness of his fear.   Ravindran, 976 F.2d at 758 (citation omitted).  We review the determination that petitioner was not a refugee under the substantial evidence standard.   See Alvarez-Flores, 909 F.2d at 3.  Thus, we will affirm the BIA's decision if \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole....  \" See 8 U.S.C.

First, he states that his grandfather's mill was confiscated by the communist governmental authorities in 1953 and that these authorities imprisoned his grandfather for four years.  This persecution, petitioner alleges, resulted in limited educational and vocational opportunities for petitioner's mother, as well as for the entire family.  Specifically, petitioner refers to an incident that occurred in 1987.  At this time, petitioner and his brother approached the government about starting their own business.  According to petitioner, they were informed that membership in the Communist Party would \"greatly\" improve their chances of success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining that petitioner did not have a well- founded fear of persecution, the immigration judge relied on the change in the government in Czechoslovakia since the occurrence of the above events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I take judicial notice that Czechoslovakia, at the present time, is a free and independent country.  I take judicial notice that the Russian Army has left the territory of Czechoslovakia and that democratic institutions have been instituted in Czechoslovakia and that Czechoslovakia has an independent democratic government with democratic institutions in place since the Soviet Forces have left Czechoslovakia, and that there have been elections, and that free elections have resulted in a free democratic government being installed in Czechoslovakia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner objects to the \"judicial notice\" by the immigration judge of these facts.  He argues that the judge went beyond what is \"commonly acknowledged\" and, instead, expressed his own, personal opinion.  Further, petitioner claims that he was not given a sufficient opportunity to rebut this information.  However, petitioner failed to raise these arguments in his brief in support of his appeal to the BIA. \"Issues not raised before the [BIA] may not be raised for the first time upon judicial review of the [BIA's] decisions.\"   Ravindran, 976 F.2d at 761.  Thus, petitioner has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and has waived review of these issues.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basis for the immigration judge's findings is the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1990 of the Department of State, admitted, without objection, as exhibit 5 at the hearing.  In addition to the facts stated by the judge, the Country Reports provides the following information.  After the elections in 1990, legislation was enacted which provided for the rights of assembly, free speech and association.  All known political prisoners were freed and, in 1990, there were no reports of torture or other cruel, or degrading, punishments.  The Soviet Ministry of Interior, which had been used as \"an instrument to control the population,\" was abolished.  Limitations on private enterprises were removed and efforts are being made to establish a market economy.  Individuals are permitted to, and, in fact, do, express their political opinions and engage in criticism of the present government.  Finally, citizens who had left the country during the communist regime are free to return to Czechoslovakia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to rebut this information, petitioner opines that these changes are only superficial.  Specifically, he asserts that it is likely that the previous communist officials still control the government, the economy and the local bureaucracies.  Thus, he asserts, the \"day-to-day\" operation of governmental agencies is the same as it was under the Soviet regime.  Petitioner concludes that he still would be prevented from securing any economic gain if he returned and that because of his anti-communist beliefs, still would be at a high risk of persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He also argues that two letters-one from his mother and the other from a friend-provide specific facts that should be credited over the general conclusions of the Country Reports.  These letters, admitted as exhibits 3 and 4, recite that disorder prevails in Czechoslovakia and that the government has not changed.  Also, petitioner's mother writes that incompetent people run the government, that criticism is not tolerated and that if individuals return from the West, they are seen as criminals and become the targets of witchhunts and vindictive acts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the above, we cannot say that the BIA lacked a substantial basis for its finding that petitioner's fears were not well-founded.  Without determining whether petitioner's allegations even amount to \"persecution,\" we note that the only evidence of specific acts on the part of the government occurred before the change in government in 1990.  Petitioner's family continues to live in Czechoslovakia without having suffered any instances of persecution.  Petitioner has been allowed by the authorities to travel to this country;  he also took trips to Hungary, Germany and Yugoslavia.  While petitioner remained in this country, his wife was freely permitted to travel between the United States and Czechoslovakia with no adverse consequences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's testimony and the two letters contain only conclusory statements that circumstances have not changed.  The general references to disorder and to the status of refugees returning to Czechoslovakia from the West are not supported by particular incidents or names, dates and additional relevant information.  This court and others have upheld the BIA's denial of asylum claims in cases where the evidence has been far more compelling.   See, e.g., Ravindran, 976 F.2d at 759 (imprisonment of petitioner by government for three days, search of family home, the witnessing by petitioner of random acts of violence by the majority ethnic group and persecution of petitioner's uncle were insufficient to establish refugee status);   Alvarez-Flores, 909 F.2d at 5-6 (the detention of petitioner, once by the guerrillas in El Salvador and once by the military, insufficient to show a well-founded fear of persecution).   See also Arriaga-Barrientos v. United States INS, 937 F.2d 411, 414 (9th Cir. 1991) (violence against family insufficient to establish persecution unless evidence shows a pattern closely associated with the petitioner);  Zalega v. INS, 916 F.2d 1257, 1260 (7th Cir. 1990) (persecution is not demonstrated despite repeated detentions and interrogations of petitioner where no formal charges were filed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, petitioner has failed to present any \"compelling\" evidence such that \"no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\"   See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 112 S. Ct. 812, 817 (1992).  As a result, he does not qualify for political asylum under Section 208(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C.
