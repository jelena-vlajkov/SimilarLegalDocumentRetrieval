Nieves-Burgos asserts,\r\n\nfirst, that the  jury's general verdict of guilty  on the firearm\r\n\ncharge is ambiguous and must be set  aside, as it was returned on\r\n\na single charge containing three alleged violations, two of which\r\n\nwere not  supported by  the evidence at  trial.   Second, Nieves-\r\n\nBurgos  asserts  that  the only  alleged  violation  supported by\r\n\nevidence   at  trial  was  itself  not  supported  by  sufficient\r\n\nevidence.  We conclude that the jury verdict is not ambiguous and\r\n\nis adequately supported by the evidence, and we affirm.\r\n\n                          I.

Ct. 193 (1994), an appeal taken  by Nieves-\r                      \r\n\nBurgos'  co-defendants.  We therefore recount the relevant facts,\r\n\nwhich  for the most part are not  disputed, only briefly, and, as\r\n\nis appropriate,  we  do so  in the  light most  favorable to  the\r\n\nverdict.  See  United States v. Torres-Maldonado, 14  F.3d 95, 98\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 193 (1994).\r                                  \r\n\n          In  February  1991,  Nieves-Burgos and  several  others\r\n\nrented rooms  310, 311, and  327 of the  Carib Inn Hotel  in Isla\r\n\nVerde, Puerto Rico.  Nieves-Burgos  rented room 311 using a false\r\n\nname.  The group occupied the rooms for several weeks.   On March\r\n\n6, 1991, hotel  security personnel notified police  of suspicious\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n conduct in  the three rooms.  There had been frequent traffic to,\r\n\nfrom, and between the rooms; the  three rooms received 90% of the\r\n\nhotel's  incoming telephone calls; the  rooms often were paid for\r\n\ntogether,  in cash; and,  a hotel  floor supervisor  observed two\r\n\nhandguns on a bureau in room 327.\r\n\n          Agents of the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\r\n\nand Firearms  (ATF) began surveillance  of the hotel on  March 6.\r\n\nAt approximately 11:00  p.m. that evening, they  observed Nieves-\r\n\nBurgos,  H ctor  Santiago-Alicea, Teddy  Le n-Ayala,  Oscar D az-\r\n\nCruz, and  an unidentified man  in the  hotel lobby.   The agents\r\n\nobserved Santiago-Alicea wearing a bullet-proof jacket, which was\r\n\nbulging from something concealed underneath.  The group proceeded\r\n\noutside the  hotel to a  parking lot, where the  unidentified man\r\n\nproduced a bag and handed it to Santiago-Alicea.\r\n\n          Later  that  same  evening,  another  unidentified  man\r\n\narrived at the hotel, and was met by Nieves-Burgos and Pedro Luis\r\n\nRam rez-Rivera  (Ram rez-Rivera).   After  a brief  conversation,\r\n\nNieves-Burgos and Ram rez-Rivera left the unidentified man.  They\r\n\nreturned  a short while later with Santiago-Alicea, who exchanged\r\n\npackages with the unidentified man.\r\n\n          On March 7,  1991, ATF agents executed a search warrant\r\n\nat the three hotel rooms.  In room 311, they found  five persons:\r\n\nNieves-Burgos,  Marilyn  Gotay-Col n,  Catalino Torres-Maldonado,\r\n\nRam rez-Rivera, and Santiago-Alicea.  Nieves-Burgos was on one of\r\n\nthe room's two beds, clad in his underwear.  A search of the room\r\n\nrevealed  quantities of cocaine, several bundles of cash, various\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n instruments  and supplies typically used for packaging cocaine, a\r\n\nbullet-proof jacket, and a loaded Beretta semi-automatic handgun.\r\n\nThe gun was found with  a bundle of cash in  a zippered bag on  a\r\n\nsofa on which Gotay-Col n was seated.   The bag was located  less\r\n\nthan two feet from Nieves-Burgos.\r\n\n          Rooms 310 and 327 were  also searched, as were two cars\r\n\nthat  were  in  the  hotel's  parking  lot.    More  cocaine  and\r\n\nparaphernalia  were found in  the two rooms.   Guns were found in\r\n\nthe two cars.   In a green  Ford LTD, agents found  a loaded .357\r\n\nrevolver;  also  found were  a  picture  of Nieves-Burgos  and  a\r\n\nparking ticket  on which was  Nieves-Burgos' fingerprint.   In  a\r\n\ngrey  Buick, a  nine-millimeter pistol  was found.    The Buick's\r\n\nregistration certificate was found in Santiago-Alicea's wallet.\r\n\n          Nieves-Burgos  and others were indicted.  In counts one\r\n\nand two of the indictment, Nieves-Burgos  and others were charged\r\n\nwith  possessing with the intent to distribute, and conspiring to\r\n\npossess  with the  intent to  distribute, cocaine.

As to Nieves-Burgos, the jury\r\n\nreturned general verdicts of guilty on counts one, two, and four.\r\n\n          Nieves-Burgos took no appeal from the guilty verdict or\r\n\nhis sentence.  Upon his imprisonment, he filed a motion to vacate\r\n\nhis  sentence  under  28  U.S.C.     2255,  claiming  ineffective\r\n\nassistance  of counsel.    His  motion was  granted,  and he  was\r\n\nafforded new  counsel for  resentencing.  On  count four,  he was\r\n\nsentenced  to sixty months'  imprisonment, to run  consecutive to\r\n\nhis sentences on the other two counts.\r\n\n          Nieves-Burgos now  appeals the guilty verdict  on count\r\n\nfour.  He asserts that the evidence was not sufficient to support\r\n\nhis  conviction as  to any  of the  three firearms.    The United\r\n\nStates argues in response that  the evidence of the firearm found\r\n\nin  room 311  was  sufficient  to support  the  conviction.   The\r\n\ngovernment expressly declines  to argue that  evidence concerning\r\n\neither  of  the  two  firearms  found  in   the  automobiles  was\r                              \r                              \r\n\nsufficient  to support  the conviction.3    During argument,  the\r                      violence  or drug  trafficking crime,  be\r\n            sentenced to imprisonment  for five years\r\n            . . . .\r\n\n3  In its brief, the government states:  \"The government does not\r\nargue that Nieves-Burgos' conviction  under Section 924(c)(1)  is\r\nsupported by [evidence of] the two guns found during the searches\r\nof the cars.\"  Government's Brief at 7 n.5.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n parties were asked  to submit supplemental briefs  concerning the\r\n\nissue whether the general verdict of guilty should stand where it\r\n\nwas returned on  a count containing  three alleged violations  of\r\n\nthe firearms statute, two of which concededly were unsupported by\r\n\nevidence at  trial.   The parties'  arguments  were received  and\r\n\nconsidered.  We address the issues.\r\n\n                          II.  ANALYSIS\r                                    II.  ANALYSIS\r\n\nA.  The General Verdict\r          A.  The General Verdict\r                                 \r\n\n          Nieves-Burgos initially argues that  his conviction for\r\n\nviolation of  18 U.S.C.    924(c)(1) cannot  stand as  the jury's\r\n\ngeneral verdict of  guilty was ambiguous in that  it was returned\r\n\non a charge that alleged  the use of three firearms  in violation\r\n\nof  18 U.S.C.    924(c)(1),  and the  evidence at  trial was  not\r\n\nsufficient to  support a  conviction as to  two of  the firearms.\r\n\nThe  government  concedes  that the  evidence  at  trial did  not\r\n\nsupport a conviction  as to two of  the three firearms listed  in\r\n\ncount  four, but argues  that the verdict  should stand as  it is\r\n\nsupported by sufficient evidence as to the remaining firearm.\r\n\n          This issue  was  effectively determined  in Griffin  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nUnited States, 502 U.S. 46 (1991).  In Griffin, the appellant had\r                                                        \r\n\nbeen convicted by jury of  an unlawful conspiracy in violation of\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   371.   See Griffin v. United States,  502 U.S. 46, 47\r                                                         \r\n\n(1991).   A  single  count  in the  indictment  charged that  the\r\n\nconspiracy had two  unlawful objects:   impeding  efforts of  the\r\n\nInternal  Revenue Service to ascertain income taxes; and impeding\r\n\nefforts  of  the  Drug  Enforcement  Administration to  ascertain\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n forfeitable income.   See  id.  The  evidence presented  at trial\r                                       \r\n\nfailed to  establish the appellant's  guilt with  respect to  the\r\n\nsecond object.  See id. at 47-48.

The  evidence supports  the  existence  of  the\r\n\nfollowing  facts:  Nieves-Burgos rented and occupied room 311; he\r\n\nwas a direct participant in the drug distribution scheme; the gun\r\n\nwas found in a zippered bag, also containing $2,000 in cash, on a\r\n\ncouch in room 311; Nieves-Burgos was less than  two feet from the\r\n\ngun.  Nieves-Burgos concedes in his brief that he \"clearly was in\r\n\ncontrol of Room  311.\"  A jury reasonably could  infer from these\r\n\nfacts that  the cash found in the bag  that contained the gun was\r\n\ndrug trafficking proceeds, and that Nieves-Burgos, a principal in\r\n\nthe drug trafficking scheme who  concededly was in control of the\r\n\nroom, had  knowledge of what was in the  bag, and, because of his\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n proximity to  the gun,  had the power  and intention  to exercise\r\n\ndominion over it.\r\n\n          Clearly,  there is evidence  in the record  that weighs\r\n\nagainst this conclusion:   no witness could  link the gun  or the\r\n\nbag  directly to  Nieves-Burgos; the  bag concealing the  gun was\r\n\nzippered;    several  co-defendants  were  found  sitting  within\r\n\nseveral  feet of the gun, and Gotay-Col n,  who was seated on the\r\n\ncouch, may  have been closer  to the gun than  was Nieves-Burgos.\r\n\nNonetheless, our role is not to weigh the evidence; we are merely\r\n\nto ensure that  some evidence exists to  support sufficiently the\r\n\njury's  determination.  See United States  v. Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d\r                                                                   \r\n\nat 1031.  Again, the evidence supports the inference that Nieves-\r\n\nBurgos was  in constructive possession  of the gun:   He concedes\r\n\nthat he \"clearly  was in control of Room 311\"; he was a principal\r\n\nwith respect to the underlying offense  of possession with intent\r\n\nto distribute; and, he was found near -- less than two  feet from\r\n\n-- the gun.\r\n\n          This  result  is consistent  with  Torres-Maldonado, in\r                                                                       \r\n\nwhich we concluded that the evidence at trial was insufficient to\r\n\nestablish that  appellants Torres-Maldonado and  Gotay-Col n were\r\n\nin constructive  possession of the  gun found  in room 311.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited  States  v.  Torres-Maldonado,  14  F.3d  at 102-03.

Nieves-Burgos asserts,\r\n\nfirst, that the  jury's general verdict of guilty  on the firearm\r\n\ncharge is ambiguous and must be set  aside, as it was returned on\r\n\na single charge containing three alleged violations, two of which\r\n\nwere not  supported by  the evidence at  trial.

Nieves-Burgos  rented room 311 using a false\r\n\nname.  The group occupied the rooms for several weeks.   On March\r\n\n6, 1991, hotel  security personnel notified police  of suspicious\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n conduct in  the three rooms.  There had been frequent traffic to,\r\n\nfrom, and between the rooms; the  three rooms received 90% of the\r\n\nhotel's  incoming telephone calls; the  rooms often were paid for\r\n\ntogether,  in cash; and,  a hotel  floor supervisor  observed two\r\n\nhandguns on a bureau in room 327.\r\n\n          Agents of the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\r\n\nand Firearms  (ATF) began surveillance  of the hotel on  March 6.\r\n\nAt approximately 11:00  p.m. that evening, they  observed Nieves-\r\n\nBurgos,  H ctor  Santiago-Alicea, Teddy  Le n-Ayala,  Oscar D az-\r\n\nCruz, and  an unidentified man  in the  hotel lobby.   The agents\r\n\nobserved Santiago-Alicea wearing a bullet-proof jacket, which was\r\n\nbulging from something concealed underneath.  The group proceeded\r\n\noutside the  hotel to a  parking lot, where the  unidentified man\r\n\nproduced a bag and handed it to Santiago-Alicea.\r\n\n          Later  that  same  evening,  another  unidentified  man\r\n\narrived at the hotel, and was met by Nieves-Burgos and Pedro Luis\r\n\nRam rez-Rivera  (Ram rez-Rivera).   After  a brief  conversation,\r\n\nNieves-Burgos and Ram rez-Rivera left the unidentified man.  They\r\n\nreturned  a short while later with Santiago-Alicea, who exchanged\r\n\npackages with the unidentified man.\r\n\n          On March 7,  1991, ATF agents executed a search warrant\r\n\nat the three hotel rooms.  In room 311, they found  five persons:\r\n\nNieves-Burgos,  Marilyn  Gotay-Col n,  Catalino Torres-Maldonado,\r\n\nRam rez-Rivera, and Santiago-Alicea.  Nieves-Burgos was on one of\r\n\nthe room's two beds, clad in his underwear.  A search of the room\r\n\nrevealed  quantities of cocaine, several bundles of cash, various\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n instruments  and supplies typically used for packaging cocaine, a\r\n\nbullet-proof jacket, and a loaded Beretta semi-automatic handgun.\r\n\nThe gun was found with  a bundle of cash in  a zippered bag on  a\r\n\nsofa on which Gotay-Col n was seated.   The bag was located  less\r\n\nthan two feet from Nieves-Burgos.\r\n\n          Rooms 310 and 327 were  also searched, as were two cars\r\n\nthat  were  in  the  hotel's  parking  lot.    More  cocaine  and\r\n\nparaphernalia  were found in  the two rooms.   Guns were found in\r\n\nthe two cars.   In a green  Ford LTD, agents found  a loaded .357\r\n\nrevolver;  also  found were  a  picture  of Nieves-Burgos  and  a\r\n\nparking ticket  on which was  Nieves-Burgos' fingerprint.   In  a\r\n\ngrey  Buick, a  nine-millimeter pistol  was found.    The Buick's\r\n\nregistration certificate was found in Santiago-Alicea's wallet.\r\n\n          Nieves-Burgos  and others were indicted.  In counts one\r\n\nand two of the indictment, Nieves-Burgos  and others were charged\r\n\nwith  possessing with the intent to distribute, and conspiring to\r\n\npossess  with the  intent to  distribute, cocaine.

As to Nieves-Burgos, the jury\r\n\nreturned general verdicts of guilty on counts one, two, and four.\r\n\n          Nieves-Burgos took no appeal from the guilty verdict or\r\n\nhis sentence.  Upon his imprisonment, he filed a motion to vacate\r\n\nhis  sentence  under  28  U.S.C.     2255,  claiming  ineffective\r\n\nassistance  of counsel.    His  motion was  granted,  and he  was\r\n\nafforded new  counsel for  resentencing.  On  count four,  he was\r\n\nsentenced  to sixty months'  imprisonment, to run  consecutive to\r\n\nhis sentences on the other two counts.\r\n\n          Nieves-Burgos now  appeals the guilty verdict  on count\r\n\nfour.  He asserts that the evidence was not sufficient to support\r\n\nhis  conviction as  to any  of the  three firearms.    The United\r\n\nStates argues in response that  the evidence of the firearm found\r\n\nin  room 311  was  sufficient  to support  the  conviction.   The\r\n\ngovernment expressly declines  to argue that  evidence concerning\r\n\neither  of  the  two  firearms  found  in   the  automobiles  was\r                              \r                              \r\n\nsufficient  to support  the conviction.3    During argument,  the\r                      violence  or drug  trafficking crime,  be\r\n            sentenced to imprisonment  for five years\r\n            . . . .\r\n\n3  In its brief, the government states:  \"The government does not\r\nargue that Nieves-Burgos' conviction  under Section 924(c)(1)  is\r\nsupported by [evidence of] the two guns found during the searches\r\nof the cars.\"  Government's Brief at 7 n.5.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n parties were asked  to submit supplemental briefs  concerning the\r\n\nissue whether the general verdict of guilty should stand where it\r\n\nwas returned on  a count containing  three alleged violations  of\r\n\nthe firearms statute, two of which concededly were unsupported by\r\n\nevidence at  trial.

The General Verdict\r                                 \r\n\n          Nieves-Burgos initially argues that  his conviction for\r\n\nviolation of  18 U.S.C.    924(c)(1) cannot  stand as  the jury's\r\n\ngeneral verdict of  guilty was ambiguous in that  it was returned\r\n\non a charge that alleged  the use of three firearms  in violation\r\n\nof  18 U.S.C.    924(c)(1),  and the  evidence at  trial was  not\r\n\nsufficient to  support a  conviction as to  two of  the firearms.\r\n\nThe  government  concedes  that the  evidence  at  trial did  not\r\n\nsupport a conviction  as to two of  the three firearms listed  in\r\n\ncount  four, but argues  that the verdict  should stand as  it is\r\n\nsupported by sufficient evidence as to the remaining firearm.\r\n\n          This issue  was  effectively determined  in Griffin  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112659\"><a href=\"/opinion/112659/griffin-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1991).

The  evidence supports  the  existence  of  the\r\n\nfollowing  facts:  Nieves-Burgos rented and occupied room 311; he\r\n\nwas a direct participant in the drug distribution scheme; the gun\r\n\nwas found in a zippered bag, also containing $2,000 in cash, on a\r\n\ncouch in room 311; Nieves-Burgos was less than  two feet from the\r\n\ngun.  Nieves-Burgos concedes in his brief that he \"clearly was in\r\n\ncontrol of Room  311.\"  A jury reasonably could  infer from these\r\n\nfacts that  the cash found in the bag  that contained the gun was\r\n\ndrug trafficking proceeds, and that Nieves-Burgos, a principal in\r\n\nthe drug trafficking scheme who  concededly was in control of the\r\n\nroom, had  knowledge of what was in the  bag, and, because of his\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n proximity to  the gun,  had the power  and intention  to exercise\r\n\ndominion over it.\r\n\n          Clearly,  there is evidence  in the record  that weighs\r\n\nagainst this conclusion:   no witness could  link the gun  or the\r\n\nbag  directly to  Nieves-Burgos; the  bag concealing the  gun was\r\n\nzippered;    several  co-defendants  were  found  sitting  within\r\n\nseveral  feet of the gun, and Gotay-Col n,  who was seated on the\r\n\ncouch, may  have been closer  to the gun than  was Nieves-Burgos.\r\n\nNonetheless, our role is not to weigh the evidence; we are merely\r\n\nto ensure that  some evidence exists to  support sufficiently the\r\n\njury's  determination.

Again, the evidence supports the inference that Nieves-\r\n\nBurgos was  in constructive possession  of the gun:   He concedes\r\n\nthat he \"clearly  was in control of Room 311\"; he was a principal\r\n\nwith respect to the underlying offense  of possession with intent\r\n\nto distribute; and, he was found near -- less than two  feet from\r\n\n-- the gun.\r\n\n          This  result  is consistent  with  Torres-Maldonado, in\r                                                                       \r\n\nwhich we concluded that the evidence at trial was insufficient to\r\n\nestablish that  appellants Torres-Maldonado and  Gotay-Col n were\r\n\nin constructive  possession of the  gun found  in room 311.
