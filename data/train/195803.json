(\"the\n\nCompany\").   Following a four-day  trial, a  jury returned  a\n\nspecial verdict in favor of the Company, specifically finding\n\nthat the  saw  was not  defectively designed.   The  district\n\ncourt  entered  judgment  for  the  Company and  subsequently\n\ndenied   the   Espeaignnettes'  post-trial   motions.     The\n\nEspeaignnettes now appeal, assigning  error to several of the\n\ndistrict court's  evidentiary rulings.  Because  we hold that\n\nthe  district  court  abused   its  discretion  in  excluding\n\nevidence pertaining  to subsequent modifications made  to the\n\nsaw by Espeaignnette's1 employer,  we vacate the judgment and\n\nremand for new trial.\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \n\n                          Background\r                                      Background\r                                                \n\n          In  1990,  Espeaignnette's  employer, the  Isaacson\n\nLumber Company  (\"Isaacson\"), purchased  a Bottom  Arbor Gang\n\nSaw, or  \"edger,\" designed  and manufactured by  the Company.\n\nIsaacson employs the edger to \"square\" or \"edge\" slabs of raw\n\nlumber.   The edger operates in the following manner:  First,\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  All references  in the opinion  to \"Espeaignnette\"  refer\nsolely to William Espeaignnette.\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nthe operator feeds slabs of raw lumber into the edger along a\n\nroller table,  passing  the slabs  through anti-kick  fingers\n\nthat prevent the slabs from kicking back towards the operator\n\nas  they contact the saw  blades.  After  passing through the\n\nanti-kick fingers, powered infeed  rollers grab the slabs and\n\npull them into the saw blades.  As designed and manufactured,\n\nthe  area surrounding  the anti-kick  fingers and  the infeed\n\nrollers is open and not guarded by any physical covering.\n\n          The operator  controls  the edger  from  a  station\n\nlocated  at one end of the machine.  During normal operation,\n\nthere is no need for the  operator to approach the open space\n\nnear the anti-kick fingers and  the infeed rollers, except to\n\ninspect   or  listen   for  strips   of  \"edged\"   wood  that\n\noccasionally \"hang  up\" in the  saw-blade area.   When strips\n\nbecome stuck in this area, the operator must stop the machine\n\nand clear the work surface or risk damaging the saw blades.\n\n          Following    installation     of    the    machine,\n\nEspeaignnette  was   trained  to   operate   the  edger   and\n\nsubsequently ran it without  incident for a period of  two to\n\nthree  weeks.  According  to his trial  testimony, on October\n\n11, 1990, at approximately  10:30 p.m., Espeaignnette heard a\n\nnoise that he  thought indicated  that a sliver  of wood  had\n\nbecome stuck in the saw-blade section of the edger.   At this\n\npoint, Espeaignnette had been working for sixteen hours, with\n\nonly a  half-hour lunch break.   Espeaignnette testified that\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nhe walked to the side of the edger, crouched down, and peered\n\ninto the  blades  to investigate.   Espeaignnette  maintained\n\nthat  he did not stop the edger while investigating the noise\n\nbecause  to  do   so  would  needlessly   increase  downtime,\n\nexplaining that the edger  often emitted similar sounds that,\n\nupon investigation, did not require a shutdown.\n\n          Espeaignnette  testified that while he was crouched\n\nbeside the  edger, he saw a sliver of wood work free from the\n\nsaw-blade area.  He then attempted to stand up but, as he did\n\nso,  lost his  balance and  stumbled towards  the edger.   He\n\nfurther testified that,  as he stumbled, he reached  out with\n\nhis right hand to balance himself and inadvertently stuck his\n\nhand into the area  of the infeed rollers, causing  his right\n\nglove to become caught on a roller.  As a result, his arm was\n\ncrushed,  pulled into  the saw-blade  area, and  then severed\n\nbelow the right elbow.2\n\n          Following  the accident, Isaacson  continued to use\n\nthe  edger  to cut  raw  lumber.    In the  summer  of  1993,\n\napproximately six months before  trial, an Isaacson  employee\n\nmodified  the edger  by  welding to  it  a steel  plate  that\n\ncovered the open area by the infeed rollers and the anti-kick\n\nfingers. \n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  The Company maintains that the accident  occurred because\nEspeaignnette  purposely, and  not  inadvertently, stuck  his\nhand into the area of  the infeed rollers to free a  piece of\nwood.\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          Espeaignnette tried this action against the Company\n\nsolely on  a theory  of strict liability,  alleging that  the\n\nedger  was defectively  designed  and unreasonably  dangerous\n\nbecause of  the lack of physical guards  covering the infeed-\n\nroller  area.    As co-plaintiff,  Rita  Espeaignnette sought\n\ncompensation  for  loss  of   consortium  stemming  from  the\n\ninjuries to her husband.\n\n          Prior  to trial,  the  Company moved  in limine  to\r                                                                     \n\nexclude all evidence pertaining to Isaacson's modification of\n\nthe edger, and the  Espeaignnettes similarly moved to exclude\n\nevidence  about the absence of comparable accidents involving\n\nedgers  designed   by  the  Company.     The  district  court\n\nprovisionally granted  the Company's motion and  excluded the\n\nmodification  evidence pursuant  to Fed.  R. Evid.  407 as  a\n\nsubsequent  remedial   measure,  subject,  however,   to  the\n\ncondition  that  the  Company  not controvert  at  trial  the\n\nfeasibility   of   such   a   modification.3      The   court\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  Fed. R. Evid. 407 provides:\n\n          When,  after an event, measures are taken\n          which,  if  taken previously,  would have\n          made  the  event  less  likely  to occur,\n          evidence  of  the subsequent  measures is\n          not  admissible  to  prove negligence  or\n          culpable conduct in  connection with  the\n          event.   This  rule does not  require the\n          exclusion   of  evidence   of  subsequent\n          measures   when   offered   for   another\n          purpose,   such  as   proving  ownership,\n          control, or  feasibility of precautionary\n          measures,     if     controverted,     or\n          impeachment.\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nprovisionally  denied  the Espeaignnettes'  motion  and, over\n\nobjection, permitted the owner  of the Company, Gene Tierney,\n\nto testify  about the absence  of reports of  other accidents\n\ninvolving similar edgers designed by the Company.  \n\n          During  trial, the  Espeaignnettes raised  at least\n\ntwice the issue of the subsequent-modification evidence.  The\n\ndistrict  court  declined  to  admit  the  evidence  on  each\n\noccurrence.   Although eventually  finding that the  issue of\n\nfeasibility  had  been  clearly  raised,  the district  court\n\nnonetheless excluded  the evidence pursuant to  Fed. R. Evid.\n\n403 because the prejudicial impact of the evidence outweighed\n\nits probative  value.4  The  Espeaignnettes made an  offer of\n\nproof  stating,  inter alia,  that  they sought  to  call the\r                                       \n\ncurrent operator of the edger to testify that he had operated\n\nthe edger  both before and  after its  1993 modification  and\n\nthat  the modification had in  no way inhibited the operation\n\nof the machine.\n\n          During  trial, the  district court also  denied the\n\nEspeaignnettes' objections  to the qualification of a witness\n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  Fed. R. Evid. 403 provides:\n\n          Although   relevant,   evidence  may   be\n          excluded  if  its   probative  value   is\n          substantially outweighed by the danger of\n          unfair   prejudice,   confusion  of   the\n          issues,  or  misleading the  jury,  or by\n          considerations of undue  delay, waste  of\n          time,   or   needless   presentation   of\n          cumulative evidence.\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nfor the Company  as an expert  in \"industrial human  factors\"\n\nand  to that  witness's testimony  concerning whether  it was\n\npossible for Espeaignnette  to have fallen into  the edger as\n\nhe alleged.\n\n          Following  closing  arguments,  the district  court\n\nsubmitted the case to the jury  as a series of questions on a\n\nspecial-verdict  form.   The first  question was  whether the\n\nedger  was  \"in   a  defective  condition  and   unreasonably\n\ndangerous.\"   The jury answered this question in the negative\n\nand,  in accordance with the instructions on the form and the\n\ndistrict court's  oral  instructions, proceeded  no  further.\n\nThe jury did not answer the subsequent questions on proximate\n\ncause  and assumption  of risk.   Subsequently,  the district\n\ncourt  entered  judgment  for  the  Company  and  denied  the\n\nEspeaignnettes' motions for judgment as a matter of law and a\n\nnew trial.  This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \n\n          The   Espeaignnettes   assign   error    to   three\n\nevidentiary rulings.   They  contend that the  district court\n\nerred  in (1)  excluding under  Rule 403  evidence concerning\n\nIsaacson's  installation  of the  fixed  metal  guard on  the\n\nedger, (2) admitting evidence concerning the absence of other\n\naccidents involving  similar edgers designed  by the Company,\n\nand (3) qualifying a witness for  the Company as an expert in\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n\"industrial  human  factors\" and  permitting  the  witness to\n\ntestify on that subject.  We discuss each argument in turn.\n\nA.  Subsequent Modification of the Edger\r                                                    \n\n          We  begin  by  noting  that a  district  court  has\n\nconsiderable  latitude  in  determining whether  to  admit or\n\nexclude evidence  under Rule 403.   See, e.g.,  Newell Puerto\r                                                                         \n\nRico,  Ltd. v.

The  Espeaignnettes argue\n\nthat the evidence was vital to establishing their prima facie\n\ncase  of  strict  liability  under  Maine  law and  that  the\n\ndistrict court  vastly  overestimated the  danger  of  unfair\n\nprejudice.  After a careful review of both the applicable law\n\nand  the facts  and circumstances  surrounding this  case, we\n\nagree.5\n\n          The  Espeaignnettes tried  their claim  against the\n\nCompany  pursuant   solely   to  Maine's   strict   liability\n\nstatute.6   Under the Maine  statute, a plaintiff  must prove\n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.  Because the district court excluded the evidence at trial\npursuant  to Rule  403,  its pre-trial  ruling excluding  the\nevidence under Rule 407 as  a subsequent remedial measure  is\nnot  at issue.

Moreover,  this evidence  bears\n\ndirectly on whether the edger  was defectively designed.   It\n\nallows the jury to compare the utility and  risk of the edger\n\nas actually designed (without the guard) with the utility and\n\nrisk  of the alternate  design (with the  guard).  Therefore,\n\nbecause the evidence was crucial to the Espeaignnettes' case,\n\nunless   the   danger  of   unfair   prejudice  substantially\n\noutweighed its probative value,  the evidence should not have\n\nbeen excluded.

In his opening  remarks, the Company's\ncounsel stated:\n\n               One of the  reasons, you will learn,\n          that there  is an  opening  in this  very\n          area  is  it is  mandatory that  there be\r                                                               \n          access    to    do    just   what    [the\r                            \n          Espeaignnettes'  counsel] indicated,  and\n          that is unjam, unplug  what can happen in\n          there.   There is a necessity  to look in\n          that  area and  to, once  the machine  is\n          turned off, reach in and unplug it.\n\n(Emphasis  supplied).

Evid. 403 advisory committee's note.\n\n          In  its final  trial  ruling,  the  district  court\n\nexcluded the evidence, reasoning only that: \n\n          the prejudicial impact  of that  evidence\n          as it relates  to Isaacson correcting the\n          machine or having the  machine corrected,\n          the prejudicial impact  of that  evidence\n          outweighs  the  probative  value   of  it\n          because the jury may very well infer from\n          that activity  that that was  -- they may\n          take   that   evidence  as   evidence  of\n          negligence  or  product liability  on the\n          part   of   the  defendant   rather  than\n          evidence  for  which   it  is   intended;\n          namely, the feasibility of   putting that\n          or making that repair on the machine.\n\n          The  district   court   viewed  the   evidence   as\n\nadmissible  (if at  all)  only to  show feasibility  under an\n\nexception  to   Rule  407.     Therefore,  in   weighing  the\n\nprejudicial  impact  of  the  evidence,  the  court  examined\n\nwhether  it  would  tend to  show  something  more  than just\n\nfeasibility  (e.g. negligence  or  product  liability).    As\n\nnoted, however, because  a third party, and not  the Company,\n\nmodified the edger, the evidence  of the modification was not\n\nsubject  to  exclusion under  Rule 407.    See supra  note 5.\r                                                                \n\nTherefore,  the  fact  that  the   Espeaignnettes'  proffered\n\nevidence  may  have tended  to  show  \"negligence or  product\n\nliability\" rather  than just feasibility did  not, by itself,\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nconstitute an improper  use of the  evidence and warrant  its\n\nexclusion as unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403.  \n\n          Moreover,  once the  analysis is  conducted outside\n\nthe Rule 407 framework,  we do not believe that  the excluded\n\nevidence posed any significant risk of unfair prejudice.  The\n\nIsaacson modification  was not a subsequent  design developed\n\nwell after the  edger was  manufactured.  Hence,  it was  not\n\n(arguably) misleading or unfairly prejudicial on the issue of\n\nwhether the edger was  unreasonably dangerous at the time  of\n\nmanufacture.    See,  e.g.,  Grenada Steel  Indus.,  Inc.  v.\r                                                                     \n\nAlabama Oxygen Co., 695 F.2d 883, 889 (5th Cir. 1983) (design\r                              \n\nchanges  developed after  the manufacture  of the  product in\r                              \n\nquestion are  irrelevant to the reasonableness  of the design\n\nat  the time of manufacture).  True, Isaacson did not install\n\na  guard on  the edger until  more than  two years  after the\n\naccident.   The  Company, however,  does not  contend  that a\n\nguard  could  not  have  been   installed  at  the  time   of\n\nmanufacture or even that the installation was not considered.\n\nTherefore, the Espeaignnettes'  proffered evidence would  not\n\nhave introduced design  choices not known or feasible  at the\n\ntime of manufacture.\n\n          Furthermore, the Company's failure in  its brief to\n\nillustrate how  the  excluded evidence  would  be  \"unfairly\"\n\nprejudicial to its case confirms our conclusion.

Though this is a difference, we cannot say\n\nthat it is particularly confusing or unfairly prejudicial.\n\n          In sum, the proffered evidence posed no significant\n\nrisk of unfair prejudice.9\n\n          Nevertheless, we remain mindful of  the substantial\n\ndeference  that is  properly accorded  to a  district court's\n\njudgment in \"`steadying the  Rule 403 seesaw.'\"   Kassel, 875\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d at 952 (quoting Onujiogu, 817  F.2d at 6).  The question\r                                         \n\nis not whether we would strike the balance differently in the\n\nfirst instance, but whether the balance actually struck is so\n\negregiously  one-sided  that  it   requires  reversal.    Our\n\ndecision in Swajian v. General Motors Corp., 916 F.2d 31 (1st\r                                                       \n\nCir. 1990), in  which we reversed a district court's decision\n\n                    \r                                \n\n9.  We also note that in its provisional ruling before trial,\nthe  district court excluded the evidence under Rule 407, but\nadded, \"I am more concerned, frankly, with prejudicial impact\nthat  that  kind   of  evidence  would  have   on  the  jury;\nspecifically, that  portion of  the evidence  which indicates\nthat  the  same  machine, at  the  same  place,  in the  same\nfactory,  was in  fact  remedied  to  prevent  this  kind  of\naccident.\"    The  district  court  did  not  reiterate  this\nreasoning when it excluded  the evidence under Rule 403.   In\nany event, we are unconvinced that the fact that the evidence\nconcerned the specific edger  involved in the accident evokes\nany special degree of unfair prejudice in this case.\r                                        \n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nin a  products liability action to  exclude evidence pursuant\n\nto Rule 403, informs our analysis on this issue.10  \n\n          In Swajian, the plaintiff's  wife was killed when a\r                                \n\ntruck she  had been driving rolled over  in an accident.  The\n\nplaintiff contended that the  truck's rear axle was defective\n\nand had caused the accident.  General Motors argued, however,\n\nthat driver error was the cause.  The district court excluded\n\nevidence  that the decedent  had been  drinking prior  to the\n\naccident, finding that the evidence was \"unduly inflammatory\"\n\nand  that  its  prejudicial  impact would  far  outweigh  its\n\nprobative value.  Id. at 34.  \r                                 \n\n          On  appeal, we  reversed, criticizing  the district\n\ncourt for its  failure in  striking the Rule  403 balance  to\n\ndistinguish between evidence that is prejudicial and evidence\n\nthat  is  unfairly prejudicial.   Id.  at  35.   Moreover, we\r                                                 \n\nstressed that  the evidence  was highly probative  because it\n\nbore directly on the issue of causation.  Id.\r                                                         \n\n          As  in  Swajian, the  evidence  excluded here  bore\r                                     \n\ndirectly  on an  essential element  of the  plaintiff's prima\n\n                    \r                                \n\n10.  Even though  Swajian suggests that, there,  the district\r                                     \ncourt  erred as  a  matter of  law by  not making  a specific\nfinding   of  \"unfair   prejudice,\"  the   opinion  is   best\ninterpreted  as holding  that the  district court  abused its\ndiscretion  in  conducting   the  balancing  that  Rule   403\nrequires.   This  can  be deduced  from  the Swajian  panel's\r                                                                \nreview of  the district court's balancing  of probative value\nagainst prejudicial  impact, Swajian, 916 F.2d  at 34, which,\r                                                \nin turn, supports a conclusion that the district court abused\nits discretion in striking the balance in this case.\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nfacie case.  Furthermore, as compared to the circumstances of\n\nthis  case, we  think that  the risk  of unfair  prejudice in\n\nSwajian was  decidedly more pronounced.   In Swajian,  a real\r                                                                \n\ndanger undoubtedly existed that the jury would have taken the\n\nevidence of the  decedent's drinking as showing  that she was\n\nat  fault and  not  entitled to  compensation, regardless  of\n\nwhether  or not  the axle  failure caused  the accident.   In\n\ncontrast, as  we have explained above,  the evidence excluded\n\nin this case posed little, if any, risk of unfair prejudice.\r                                                             \n\n          In sum, we are convinced that the excluded evidence\n\nwas  highly probative on an essential disputed element in the\n\ncase and  that the danger  of unfair prejudice  was extremely\n\nremote.  Accordingly, we hold that the district court  abused\n\nits discretion in excluding the proffered evidence.11\n\n          Our  determination that  the district  court abused\n\nits discretion  in striking  the Rule  403 balance does  not,\n\nhowever, end our analysis.  As with most trial errors, we are\n\nnot  empowered   to  notice  error  in   a  district  court's\n\nevidentiary ruling  \"unless a substantial right  of the party\n\n                    \r                                \n\n11.  We  further note  that the  cases on  which  the Company\nrelies  to   support  excluding  the   evidence  are  clearly\ndistinguishable.  See Harrison v.  Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,  981\r                                                                   \nF.2d 25,  31-32 (1st  Cir.  1992) (negligence  and breach  of\nwarranty action, evidence offered to  impeach only); Raymond,\r                                                                        \n938  F.2d  at  1523-24  (feasibility  stipulated  and  design\nmodification developed after manufacture of product); Grenada\r                                                                         \nSteel, 695 F.2d at  888-89 (feasibility clearly not contested\r                 \nand  design  changes  developed  years  after  manufacture of\nproduct).\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nis affected.\"  Fed.

In  determining whether  an  error affected  a  party's\n\nsubstantial right,  \"[t]he central question  is whether  this\n\ncourt can say with fair assurance . . . that the judgment was\n\nnot substantially swayed  by the error.\"   Lubanski v. Coleco\r                                                                         \n\nIndus.,  Inc., 929  F.2d  42, 46  (1st  Cir. 1991)  (internal\r                         \n\nquotations omitted). \n\n          The exclusion of the proffered  testimony cannot be\n\nconsidered  harmless.    As  noted,  the   evidence  directly\n\npertains to  whether the edger was  unreasonably dangerous at\n\nthe time of manufacture.   Therefore, we cannot say  that its\n\nabsence did  not substantially affect the  jury's decision on\n\nthis point.\n\n          Furthermore, the only issue the jury considered was\n\nwhether the edger was unreasonably dangerous.  In accord with\n\nthe court's instructions, the  jury returned a single finding\n\nthat  the  edger  was  not  \"in  a  defective  condition  and\n\nunreasonably  dangerous.\"    The  jury  did  not  answer  the\n\nsubsequent questions on  the special-verdict form  concerning\n\nproximate cause and assumption of risk.  As a result, because\n\nthe  exclusion of  the  evidence undermined  the jury's  sole\n\nfinding that the edger  was not in a defective  condition, it\n\ntherefore affected a substantial right of the Espeaignnettes.\n\nB.  Absence of other accidents\r                                          \n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\n          The  Espeaignnettes contend that the district court\n\nerred in  admitting evidence  concerning the lack  of similar\n\naccidents  involving edgers  designed  by the  Company.   The\n\nEspeaignnettes argue  that this  evidence is irrelevant  in a\n\nstrict  liability action  and, in  the alternative,  that the\n\nCompany  failed  to establish  a  proper  foundation for  the\n\nevidence.  The Espeaignnettes fail on both grounds.\n\n          As  an initial  matter, we  note that  both parties\n\nargued this  issue before  the district  court  and in  their\n\nbriefs  as though it were  controlled by state  law.  Neither\n\nside  discussed the  applicability  of the  Federal Rules  of\n\nEvidence.  Nevertheless, it  is axiomatic that in determining\n\nwhether evidence  is relevant, and therefore  admissible in a\r                                         \n\ndiversity action,  the Federal  Rules of Evidence  supply the\n\nappropriate rules of decision.  See, e.g., McInnis v. A.M.F.,\r                                                                         \n\nInc., 765 F.2d  240, 245-46  (1st Cir. 1985);  Fed. R.  Evid.\r                \n\n1101.   Normally,  the Espeaignnettes'  failure to  argue the\n\ncorrect  applicable standard  would  effect a  waiver of  the\n\nissue.    Because we  are  remanding the  issue  for retrial,\n\nhowever,  we will proceed to  discuss the issue  as it arises\n\nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence.  \n\n          Subject  to  certain limitations,  all  evidence is\n\nadmissible if it is relevant -- i.e., if it tends to make the\n\nexistence or  nonexistence of a disputed  fact \"more probable\n\nthan it would  be without the evidence.\"  Fed.  R. Evid. 401,\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\n402.   As  we have  discussed earlier,  a district  court may\n\nnonetheless exclude relevant evidence if the  probative value\n\nof the evidence is \"substantially outweighed by the danger of\n\nunfair prejudice, confusion of  the issues, or misleading the\n\njury,  or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or\n\nneedless presentation of cumulative evidence.\"  Fed. R. Evid.\n\n403.\n\n          In general, courts have recognized that the absence\n\nof prior accidents may be admissible to show:\n\n          (1)   absence  of  the  defect  or  other\n          condition alleged,\n          (2) the  lack  of a  causal  relationship\n          between  the injury  and  the  defect  or\n          condition charged, [and]\n          (3)   the   nonexistence  of   an  unduly\n          dangerous situation.\n\nStrong, 1 McCormick on  Evidence   200 at 850-51.   Moreover,\r                                            \n\nwe  recently rejected the argument that  evidence of the lack\n\nof prior accidents is irrelevant on the issue of causation in\n\na  products liability  case brought  on a  negligence theory.\n\nHarrison v. Sears,  Roebuck &amp; Co., 981 F.2d  25, 30 (1st Cir.\r                                             \n\n1992).  See also  Keller v.

The  Espeaignnettes argue,  however,  that  even if  the\nabsence  of prior accidents would be relevant in a negligence\ncase,  the  district court  should  still  have excluded  the\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\n          The evidence  of the absence of  prior accidents is\n\nclearly  relevant to  several disputed  issues in  this case.\n\nThe  fact that the Company had received no reports of similar\n\naccidents tends to  disprove causation.   That there were  no\n\nsimilar reports  of injuries due to  inadvertent contact with\n\nthe infeed rollers tends  to support the Company's contention\n\nthat  it was not possible  for Espeaignnette to have stumbled\n\naccidentally into the open  area of the edger as  he alleged.\n\nAdditionally, the absence of prior accidents is probative and\n\nrelevant to  whether the  edger as designed  was unreasonably\n\ndangerous.\n\n          The Espeaignnettes alternatively  contend that  the\n\nCompany  failed to  establish  the  necessary foundation  for\n\nadmission  of the evidence.   A review of  the cases reveals,\n\nfor  the most  part, that  evidence of  the absence  of prior\n\naccidents may not be admitted unless the offering party first\n\nestablishes that  the  \"lack of  accidents was  in regard  to\n\nproducts that are substantially identical to the one at issue\n\nand used in settings  and circumstances sufficiently  similar\n\nto   those  surrounding  the  machine  at  the  time  of  the\n\n                    \r                                \n\nevidence because the issue here turns solely on principles of\nstrict liability.   This  argument is not  persuasive because\nthe  Maine  Supreme   Judicial  Court  has  recognized   that\nnegligence and  strict liability causes of  action both share\nthe same elements  of causation  and defective  design.

Evid. 104(a).\r                  \n\n          Prior  to  testifying  about  the  lack of  similar\n\naccidents, Tierney  testified that, since  1976, his  company\n\nhad sold eighty-seven edgers  using essentially the same open\n\ninfeed-roller design.  He also testified that as president of\n\nthe Company any  claims or notices of accidents  involving an\n\nedger  designed and  manufactured by  the Company  would have\n\ncome to his  attention.  While  in different circumstances  a\n\ndistrict   court  might  require   more  to  show  sufficient\n\nsimilarity,  we think  that  Tierney's testimony  established\n\nthat  the  evidence of  the  absence of  other  accidents was\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nadmissible  in  this case.    Furthermore, we  note  that the\n\nEspeaignnettes'  counsel  soundly  attacked   this  testimony\n\nduring cross-examination,  bringing out that  Tierney did not\n\nknow whether any of the machines had been modified or if they\n\nhad been  situated so as  to prevent accidental  contact with\n\nthe infeed rollers. \n\nC.  Expert testimony\r                                \n\n          The Espeaignnettes'  final  complaint is  that  the\n\ndistrict  court  improperly  permitted the  Company's  expert\n\nwitness to testify  that it was  not physically possible  for\n\nEspeaignnette  to  stumble and  fall  into  the  edger as  he\n\ncontended.  Specifically, the Espeaignnettes contend that the\n\nCompany's  expert lacked sufficient qualifications to testify\n\nas an  \"industrial human  factors\" expert in  machine design.\n\nThey further argue that  the subject of the testimony  -- how\n\none  reacts during a stumble  -- was an  improper subject for\n\nexpert testimony because it was  within the knowledge of  the\n\naverage juror.

(\"the\n\nCompany\").   Following a four-day  trial, a  jury returned  a\n\nspecial verdict in favor of the Company, specifically finding\n\nthat the  saw  was not  defectively designed.   The  district\n\ncourt  entered  judgment  for  the  Company and  subsequently\n\ndenied   the   Espeaignnettes'  post-trial   motions.     The\n\nEspeaignnettes now appeal, assigning  error to several of the\n\ndistrict court's  evidentiary rulings.  Because  we hold that\n\nthe  district  court  abused   its  discretion  in  excluding\n\nevidence pertaining  to subsequent modifications made  to the\n\nsaw by Espeaignnette's1 employer,  we vacate the judgment and\n\nremand for new trial.\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \n\n                          Background\r                                      Background\r                                                \n\n          In  1990,  Espeaignnette's  employer, the  Isaacson\n\nLumber Company  (\"Isaacson\"), purchased  a Bottom  Arbor Gang\n\nSaw, or  \"edger,\" designed  and manufactured by  the Company.\n\nIsaacson employs the edger to \"square\" or \"edge\" slabs of raw\n\nlumber.   The edger operates in the following manner:  First,\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  All references  in the opinion  to \"Espeaignnette\"  refer\nsolely to William Espeaignnette.\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nthe operator feeds slabs of raw lumber into the edger along a\n\nroller table,  passing  the slabs  through anti-kick  fingers\n\nthat prevent the slabs from kicking back towards the operator\n\nas  they contact the saw  blades.  After  passing through the\n\nanti-kick fingers, powered infeed  rollers grab the slabs and\n\npull them into the saw blades.  As designed and manufactured,\n\nthe  area surrounding  the anti-kick  fingers and  the infeed\n\nrollers is open and not guarded by any physical covering.\n\n          The operator  controls  the edger  from  a  station\n\nlocated  at one end of the machine.  During normal operation,\n\nthere is no need for the  operator to approach the open space\n\nnear the anti-kick fingers and  the infeed rollers, except to\n\ninspect   or  listen   for  strips   of  \"edged\"   wood  that\n\noccasionally \"hang  up\" in the  saw-blade area.   When strips\n\nbecome stuck in this area, the operator must stop the machine\n\nand clear the work surface or risk damaging the saw blades.\n\n          Following    installation     of    the    machine,\n\nEspeaignnette  was   trained  to   operate   the  edger   and\n\nsubsequently ran it without  incident for a period of  two to\n\nthree  weeks.  According  to his trial  testimony, on October\n\n11, 1990, at approximately  10:30 p.m., Espeaignnette heard a\n\nnoise that he  thought indicated  that a sliver  of wood  had\n\nbecome stuck in the saw-blade section of the edger.   At this\n\npoint, Espeaignnette had been working for sixteen hours, with\n\nonly a  half-hour lunch break.   Espeaignnette testified that\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nhe walked to the side of the edger, crouched down, and peered\n\ninto the  blades  to investigate.   Espeaignnette  maintained\n\nthat  he did not stop the edger while investigating the noise\n\nbecause  to  do   so  would  needlessly   increase  downtime,\n\nexplaining that the edger  often emitted similar sounds that,\n\nupon investigation, did not require a shutdown.\n\n          Espeaignnette  testified that while he was crouched\n\nbeside the  edger, he saw a sliver of wood work free from the\n\nsaw-blade area.  He then attempted to stand up but, as he did\n\nso,  lost his  balance and  stumbled towards  the edger.   He\n\nfurther testified that,  as he stumbled, he reached  out with\n\nhis right hand to balance himself and inadvertently stuck his\n\nhand into the area  of the infeed rollers, causing  his right\n\nglove to become caught on a roller.  As a result, his arm was\n\ncrushed,  pulled into  the saw-blade  area, and  then severed\n\nbelow the right elbow.2\n\n          Following  the accident, Isaacson  continued to use\n\nthe  edger  to cut  raw  lumber.    In the  summer  of  1993,\n\napproximately six months before  trial, an Isaacson  employee\n\nmodified  the edger  by  welding to  it  a steel  plate  that\n\ncovered the open area by the infeed rollers and the anti-kick\n\nfingers. \n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  The Company maintains that the accident  occurred because\nEspeaignnette  purposely, and  not  inadvertently, stuck  his\nhand into the area of  the infeed rollers to free a  piece of\nwood.\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          Espeaignnette tried this action against the Company\n\nsolely on  a theory  of strict liability,  alleging that  the\n\nedger  was defectively  designed  and unreasonably  dangerous\n\nbecause of  the lack of physical guards  covering the infeed-\n\nroller  area.    As co-plaintiff,  Rita  Espeaignnette sought\n\ncompensation  for  loss  of   consortium  stemming  from  the\n\ninjuries to her husband.\n\n          Prior  to trial,  the  Company moved  in limine  to\r                                                                     \n\nexclude all evidence pertaining to Isaacson's modification of\n\nthe edger, and the  Espeaignnettes similarly moved to exclude\n\nevidence  about the absence of comparable accidents involving\n\nedgers  designed   by  the  Company.     The  district  court\n\nprovisionally granted  the Company's motion and  excluded the\n\nmodification  evidence pursuant  to Fed.  R. Evid.  407 as  a\n\nsubsequent  remedial   measure,  subject,  however,   to  the\n\ncondition  that  the  Company  not controvert  at  trial  the\n\nfeasibility   of   such   a   modification.3      The   court\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  Fed. R. Evid. 407 provides:\n\n          When,  after an event, measures are taken\n          which,  if  taken previously,  would have\n          made  the  event  less  likely  to occur,\n          evidence  of  the subsequent  measures is\n          not  admissible  to  prove negligence  or\n          culpable conduct in  connection with  the\n          event.   This  rule does not  require the\n          exclusion   of  evidence   of  subsequent\n          measures   when   offered   for   another\n          purpose,   such  as   proving  ownership,\n          control, or  feasibility of precautionary\n          measures,     if     controverted,     or\n          impeachment.\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nprovisionally  denied  the Espeaignnettes'  motion  and, over\n\nobjection, permitted the owner  of the Company, Gene Tierney,\n\nto testify  about the absence  of reports of  other accidents\n\ninvolving similar edgers designed by the Company.  \n\n          During  trial, the  Espeaignnettes raised  at least\n\ntwice the issue of the subsequent-modification evidence.  The\n\ndistrict  court  declined  to  admit  the  evidence  on  each\n\noccurrence.   Although eventually  finding that the  issue of\n\nfeasibility  had  been  clearly  raised,  the district  court\n\nnonetheless excluded  the evidence pursuant to  Fed. R. Evid.\n\n403 because the prejudicial impact of the evidence outweighed\n\nits probative  value.4  The  Espeaignnettes made an  offer of\n\nproof  stating,  inter alia,  that  they sought  to  call the\r                                       \n\ncurrent operator of the edger to testify that he had operated\n\nthe edger  both before and  after its  1993 modification  and\n\nthat  the modification had in  no way inhibited the operation\n\nof the machine.\n\n          During  trial, the  district court also  denied the\n\nEspeaignnettes' objections  to the qualification of a witness\n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  Fed. R. Evid. 403 provides:\n\n          Although   relevant,   evidence  may   be\n          excluded  if  its   probative  value   is\n          substantially outweighed by the danger of\n          unfair   prejudice,   confusion  of   the\n          issues,  or  misleading the  jury,  or by\n          considerations of undue  delay, waste  of\n          time,   or   needless   presentation   of\n          cumulative evidence.\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nfor the Company  as an expert  in \"industrial human  factors\"\n\nand  to that  witness's testimony  concerning whether  it was\n\npossible for Espeaignnette  to have fallen into  the edger as\n\nhe alleged.\n\n          Following  closing  arguments,  the district  court\n\nsubmitted the case to the jury  as a series of questions on a\n\nspecial-verdict  form.   The first  question was  whether the\n\nedger  was  \"in   a  defective  condition  and   unreasonably\n\ndangerous.\"   The jury answered this question in the negative\n\nand,  in accordance with the instructions on the form and the\n\ndistrict court's  oral  instructions, proceeded  no  further.\n\nThe jury did not answer the subsequent questions on proximate\n\ncause  and assumption  of risk.   Subsequently,  the district\n\ncourt  entered  judgment  for  the  Company  and  denied  the\n\nEspeaignnettes' motions for judgment as a matter of law and a\n\nnew trial.  This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \n\n          The   Espeaignnettes   assign   error    to   three\n\nevidentiary rulings.   They  contend that the  district court\n\nerred  in (1)  excluding under  Rule 403  evidence concerning\n\nIsaacson's  installation  of the  fixed  metal  guard on  the\n\nedger, (2) admitting evidence concerning the absence of other\n\naccidents involving  similar edgers designed  by the Company,\n\nand (3) qualifying a witness for  the Company as an expert in\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n\"industrial  human  factors\" and  permitting  the  witness to\n\ntestify on that subject.  We discuss each argument in turn.\n\nA.

Evid. 403 advisory committee's note.\n\n          In  its final  trial  ruling,  the  district  court\n\nexcluded the evidence, reasoning only that: \n\n          the prejudicial impact  of that  evidence\n          as it relates  to Isaacson correcting the\n          machine or having the  machine corrected,\n          the prejudicial impact  of that  evidence\n          outweighs  the  probative  value   of  it\n          because the jury may very well infer from\n          that activity  that that was  -- they may\n          take   that   evidence  as   evidence  of\n          negligence  or  product liability  on the\n          part   of   the  defendant   rather  than\n          evidence  for  which   it  is   intended;\n          namely, the feasibility of   putting that\n          or making that repair on the machine.\n\n          The  district   court   viewed  the   evidence   as\n\nadmissible  (if at  all)  only to  show feasibility  under an\n\nexception  to   Rule  407.     Therefore,  in   weighing  the\n\nprejudicial  impact  of  the  evidence,  the  court  examined\n\nwhether  it  would  tend to  show  something  more  than just\n\nfeasibility  (e.g. negligence  or  product  liability).    As\n\nnoted, however, because  a third party, and not  the Company,\n\nmodified the edger, the evidence  of the modification was not\n\nsubject  to  exclusion under  Rule 407.    See supra  note 5.\r                                                                \n\nTherefore,  the  fact  that  the   Espeaignnettes'  proffered\n\nevidence  may  have tended  to  show  \"negligence or  product\n\nliability\" rather  than just feasibility did  not, by itself,\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nconstitute an improper  use of the  evidence and warrant  its\n\nexclusion as unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403.  \n\n          Moreover,  once the  analysis is  conducted outside\n\nthe Rule 407 framework,  we do not believe that  the excluded\n\nevidence posed any significant risk of unfair prejudice.  The\n\nIsaacson modification  was not a subsequent  design developed\n\nwell after the  edger was  manufactured.  Hence,  it was  not\n\n(arguably) misleading or unfairly prejudicial on the issue of\n\nwhether the edger was  unreasonably dangerous at the time  of\n\nmanufacture.

True, Isaacson did not install\n\na  guard on  the edger until  more than  two years  after the\n\naccident.   The  Company, however,  does not  contend  that a\n\nguard  could  not  have  been   installed  at  the  time   of\n\nmanufacture or even that the installation was not considered.\n\nTherefore, the Espeaignnettes'  proffered evidence would  not\n\nhave introduced design  choices not known or feasible  at the\n\ntime of manufacture.\n\n          Furthermore, the Company's failure in  its brief to\n\nillustrate how  the  excluded evidence  would  be  \"unfairly\"\n\nprejudicial to its case confirms our conclusion.

Furthermore, as compared to the circumstances of\n\nthis  case, we  think that  the risk  of unfair  prejudice in\n\nSwajian was  decidedly more pronounced.

In\n\ncontrast, as  we have explained above,  the evidence excluded\n\nin this case posed little, if any, risk of unfair prejudice.\r                                                             \n\n          In sum, we are convinced that the excluded evidence\n\nwas  highly probative on an essential disputed element in the\n\ncase and  that the danger  of unfair prejudice  was extremely\n\nremote.  Accordingly, we hold that the district court  abused\n\nits discretion in excluding the proffered evidence.11\n\n          Our  determination that  the district  court abused\n\nits discretion  in striking  the Rule  403 balance does  not,\n\nhowever, end our analysis.  As with most trial errors, we are\n\nnot  empowered   to  notice  error  in   a  district  court's\n\nevidentiary ruling  \"unless a substantial right  of the party\n\n                    \r                                \n\n11.

As  noted,  the   evidence  directly\n\npertains to  whether the edger was  unreasonably dangerous at\n\nthe time of manufacture.   Therefore, we cannot say  that its\n\nabsence did  not substantially affect the  jury's decision on\n\nthis point.\n\n          Furthermore, the only issue the jury considered was\n\nwhether the edger was unreasonably dangerous.  In accord with\n\nthe court's instructions, the  jury returned a single finding\n\nthat  the  edger  was  not  \"in  a  defective  condition  and\n\nunreasonably  dangerous.\"    The  jury  did  not  answer  the\n\nsubsequent questions on  the special-verdict form  concerning\n\nproximate cause and assumption of risk.  As a result, because\n\nthe  exclusion of  the  evidence undermined  the jury's  sole\n\nfinding that the edger  was not in a defective  condition, it\n\ntherefore affected a substantial right of the Espeaignnettes.\n\nB.

The\n\nEspeaignnettes argue  that this  evidence is irrelevant  in a\n\nstrict  liability action  and, in  the alternative,  that the\n\nCompany  failed  to establish  a  proper  foundation for  the\n\nevidence.

Moreover,\r                                            \n\nwe  recently rejected the argument that  evidence of the lack\n\nof prior accidents is irrelevant on the issue of causation in\n\na  products liability  case brought  on a  negligence theory.\n\nHarrison v.

Oct. 19,  1994) (noting evidence of\n\nthe absence of other accidents as supporting district court's\n\nfailure  to find  design  defect or  causation in  negligence\n\ncase).12 \n\n                    \r                                \n\n12.  The  Espeaignnettes argue,  however,  that  even if  the\nabsence  of prior accidents would be relevant in a negligence\ncase,  the  district court  should  still  have excluded  the\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\n          The evidence  of the absence of  prior accidents is\n\nclearly  relevant to  several disputed  issues in  this case.\n\nThe  fact that the Company had received no reports of similar\n\naccidents tends to  disprove causation.   That there were  no\n\nsimilar reports  of injuries due to  inadvertent contact with\n\nthe infeed rollers tends  to support the Company's contention\n\nthat  it was not possible  for Espeaignnette to have stumbled\n\naccidentally into the open  area of the edger as  he alleged.\n\nAdditionally, the absence of prior accidents is probative and\n\nrelevant to  whether the  edger as designed  was unreasonably\n\ndangerous.\n\n          The Espeaignnettes alternatively  contend that  the\n\nCompany  failed to  establish  the  necessary foundation  for\n\nadmission  of the evidence.   A review of  the cases reveals,\n\nfor  the most  part, that  evidence of  the absence  of prior\n\naccidents may not be admitted unless the offering party first\n\nestablishes that  the  \"lack of  accidents was  in regard  to\n\nproducts that are substantially identical to the one at issue\n\nand used in settings  and circumstances sufficiently  similar\n\nto   those  surrounding  the  machine  at  the  time  of  the\n\n                    \r                                \n\nevidence because the issue here turns solely on principles of\nstrict liability.

Evid. 104(a).\r                  \n\n          Prior  to  testifying  about  the  lack of  similar\n\naccidents, Tierney  testified that, since  1976, his  company\n\nhad sold eighty-seven edgers  using essentially the same open\n\ninfeed-roller design.  He also testified that as president of\n\nthe Company any  claims or notices of accidents  involving an\n\nedger  designed and  manufactured by  the Company  would have\n\ncome to his  attention.  While  in different circumstances  a\n\ndistrict   court  might  require   more  to  show  sufficient\n\nsimilarity,  we think  that  Tierney's testimony  established\n\nthat  the  evidence of  the  absence of  other  accidents was\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nadmissible  in  this case.    Furthermore, we  note  that the\n\nEspeaignnettes'  counsel  soundly  attacked   this  testimony\n\nduring cross-examination,  bringing out that  Tierney did not\n\nknow whether any of the machines had been modified or if they\n\nhad been  situated so as  to prevent accidental  contact with\n\nthe infeed rollers. \n\nC.  Expert testimony\r                                \n\n          The Espeaignnettes'  final  complaint is  that  the\n\ndistrict  court  improperly  permitted the  Company's  expert\n\nwitness to testify  that it was  not physically possible  for\n\nEspeaignnette  to  stumble and  fall  into  the  edger as  he\n\ncontended.  Specifically, the Espeaignnettes contend that the\n\nCompany's  expert lacked sufficient qualifications to testify\n\nas an  \"industrial human  factors\" expert in  machine design.\n\nThey further argue that  the subject of the testimony  -- how\n\none  reacts during a stumble  -- was an  improper subject for\n\nexpert testimony because it was  within the knowledge of  the\n\naverage juror.  We do not agree.\n\n          Determinations of whether a witness is sufficiently\n\nqualified  to testify  as an  expert on  a given  subject and\n\nwhether such expert  testimony would be helpful  to the trier\n\nof  fact are committed to  the sound discretion  of the trial\n\ncourt.
