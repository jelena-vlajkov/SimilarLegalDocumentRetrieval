When  the  North   Adams\r                      LYNCH,  Circuit  Judge.\r                                            \r\r\n\nRegional Hospital was required by an  arbitrator, as a matter\r\n\nof  contract  interpretation, to  hire  an  individual as  an\r\n\nEmergency  Room  nurse whom  the  Hospital  considered to  be\r\n\nunqualified, the Hospital  challenged the arbitrator's  award\r\n\nin  federal court.   The  reviewing court  found against  the\r\n\nHospital on  the merits, but  also found the  Hospital's suit\r\n\nwas not \"frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation,\" nor\r\n\nwas  the suit \"simply  a delaying tactic.\"   Accordingly, the\r\n\ncourt  denied the  motion  for attorneys'  fees  made by  the\r\n\nMassachusetts Nurses Association.  MNA has appealed, claiming\r\n\nthe  decision not to award  fees was an  abuse of discretion.\r\n\nAs it clearly was not, we reject the appeal and affirm.\r\n\n          To state  the facts briefly:  In  1993 the Hospital\r\n\nattempted to hire for a core Emergency Room nurse position an\r\n\nexternal candidate who was better qualified than any internal\r\n\ncandidate.   MNA grieved and the arbitrator held that where a\r\n\n\"qualified\"  internal candidate  was available,  the internal\r\n\ncandidate  must   be   hired   regardless   of   the   better\r\n\nqualifications of the external candidate.  The crux, for this\r\n\nappeal,  was in  the arbitrator's  finding that  the internal\r\n\ncandidate  was at  least \"minimally  qualified\" although  the\r\n\ncandidate  lacked  certification  in  Advanced  Cardiac  Life\r\n\nSupport (\"ACLS\"),  a  skill the  Hospital, not  unreasonably,\r\n\ndesired.  The arbitrator appeared to base this finding on the\r\n\ntestimony  of one witness, whom  the Hospital argued had said\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nno such thing.  The parties have represented to us that there\r\n\nwas no transcript of the arbitration proceedings.\r\n\n          The Hospital filed suit  in the U.S. District Court\r\n\nchallenging the  award.  Its essential argument  was that the\r\n\naward  was  based on  a \"non-fact\"  and  was in  violation of\r\n\npublic policy.  But  for the gross factual error made  by the\r\n\narbitrator  as   to  whether   the  internal   candidate  was\r\n\nqualified,  said the  Hospital, the  outcome would  have been\r\n\ndifferent.   The  Hospital  argued that  while  lack of  ACLS\r\n\nqualifications might  be tolerable among  non-core staff,  it\r\n\nwas unacceptable for a  core-staff nurse -- who would  be for\r\n\nsome  periods the  person  with  primary  responsibility  for\r\n\nEmergency  Room trauma and other cases -- not to be qualified\r\n\nin advanced  cardiac life  support techniques.   The Hospital\r\n\nargued  that the increased risk  to the health  and safety of\r\n\nEmergency Room  patients should  lead to invalidation  of the\r\n\narbitrator's award on public policy grounds.   Faced with the\r\n\ndeference given by  law to arbitral awards and  the lack of a\r\n\ntranscript, the district court  rejected the challenge on the\r\n\nmerits.  The Hospital has not appealed.\r\n\n          Nevertheless, MNA  has appealed, claiming  that the\r\n\ndistrict  court  was plainly  wrong  in not  awarding  it its\r\n\nattorneys'  fees  and costs  arising  out  of the  Hospital's\r\n\nchallenge to the award.  MNA argues that  United Paperworkers\r                                                                         \r\n\nInt'l Union v.

The  Hospital's challenge to  a \"non-fact\" was  a\r\n\nrecognized ground to attack an arbitral award.\r\n\n          MNA's argument  that in any event  the Hospital was\r\n\nforeclosed from mounting a public policy argument under Misco\r                                                                         \r\n\nis also without  merit.  Because the Hospital did not cite to\r\n\na  specific statute  or  case to  support its  precise public\r\n\npolicy argument,  the argument must be  deemed frivolous, the\r\n\nMNA says.  There are three responses.\r\n\n          First,  while Misco  did  discourage public  policy\r                                         \r\n\nchallenges  to  an  arbitrator's  award  based  on  \"'general\r\n\nconsiderations of supposed public interests,'\" 484 U.S. at 43\r\n\n(quoting  W.R. Grace &amp; Co.  v. Rubber Workers,  461 U.S. 757,\r                                                         \r\n\n766  (1983)), it  reaffirmed that such  a challenge  could be\r\n\nmounted  by  \"ascertaining\"  a  \"well-defined  and  dominant\"\r\n\npolicy  \"'by reference  to the  laws and  legal precedents.'\"\r\n\n484 U.S. at 43 (quoting W.R. Grace, 461 U.S. at 766). Whether\r                                              \r\n\nsuch a policy  may be  ascertained by reference  to laws  and\r\n\nlegal  precedents is  ultimately an  issue for the  courts to\r                                                                      \r\n\ndecide  on a challenge to an arbitral  award.  See Misco, 484\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S.  at  43.   Other courts  have  recognized that  a public\r\n\npolicy challenge may be based not directly on a specific rule\r\n\nor regulation, but on the stated purpose behind such  statute\r\n\nor  regulation.   See Exxon  Shipping Co.  v. Exxon  Seamen's\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnion, 993  F.2d 357, 364  (3d Cir. 1993).   It was  at least\r                 \r\n\narguable that there  is a public  policy in Massachusetts  to\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nprotect  patients  by requiring  nurses  to  be qualified,  a\r\n\npolicy established by the Massachusetts  regulations defining\r\n\nthe  general responsibilities  of  a registered  nurse.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nBrigham &amp; Women's Hosp. v. Massachusetts Nurses Ass'n, 684 F.\r                                                                 \r\n\nSupp.  1120, 1125 (D.  Mass. 1988).   We need not  and do not\r\n\ndecide  whether such a policy exists,  but recognize that the\r\n\nexistence  of  the  argument supports  the  district  court's\r\n\nfinding  that the making of  the argument did  not justify an\r\n\naward of attorneys' fees.  \r\n\n          Second, MNA's  argument, whether meant  as such  or\r\n\nnot, comes  perilously close  to  inappropriately asking  the\r\n\ncourt to evaluate  the competency of the  presentation of the\r\n\nargument, rather than the merits of the argument itself,  for\r\n\nthe  purposes   of  imposition  of  attorneys'   fees.    Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\nChristiansburg  Garment Co.  v. Equal  Employment Opportunity\r                                                                         \r\n\nComm'n, 434 U.S.  412, 422 (1978) (attorneys' fees should not\r                  \r\n\nbe awarded  simply because,  in hindsight, the  claim appears\r                                                     \r\n\nunreasonable).   The interests served by  the attorneys' fees\r\n\naward rules are vastly different from those served by the law\r\n\ngoverning attorney competence, in its various manifestations.\r\n\nCf. id.  (in deciding whether successful  Title VII defendant\r                   \r\n\ncan recover attorneys' fees,  court considers interests to be\r\n\nserved by doctrine).   Further, while it is true  that claims\r\n\nmay be dismissed, and the consequences visited on  the client\r\n\nfor the conduct of counsel, see  Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., 370\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nU.S.  626,  633  (1962), the  loss  of  one's  own claims  is\r\n\ndifferent  in kind  from being  penalized for  bringing those\r\n\nclaims in the first place.    \r\n\n          Third, MNA's argument  does not serve  the purposes\r\n\nof the award of attorneys' fees doctrine, which carves out an\r\n\nexception to the usual  \"American Rule\".  Cf. Christiansburg,\r                                                                        \r\n\n434  U.S.  at  422   (under  the  \"American  Rule\"  litigants\r\n\ngenerally pay their own costs).  If a public policy challenge\r\n\nto  an  arbitral  award proves  ultimately  to  be  weak, the\r\n\nchallenge  will lose on the merits.  That the challenge fails\r\n\nis not  by itself a reason  to penalize the party  making the\r\n\nchallenge.   Such a rule would subvert the public interest in\r\n\nallowing public policy challenges at all to arbitral awards. \r\n\n          The  evaluation   of  whether  such  a   claim  was\r\n\nfrivolous  at the  outset,  or when  continued, is  initially\r\n\ncommitted to the  district court.  Our review is for abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion  and MNA has not  come close to  showing an abuse.\r\n\nCf.  Local 285,  Service  Employees Int'l  Union v.

The  reviewing court  found against  the\r\n\nHospital on  the merits, but  also found the  Hospital's suit\r\n\nwas not \"frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation,\" nor\r\n\nwas  the suit \"simply  a delaying tactic.\"   Accordingly, the\r\n\ncourt  denied the  motion  for attorneys'  fees  made by  the\r\n\nMassachusetts Nurses Association.  MNA has appealed, claiming\r\n\nthe  decision not to award  fees was an  abuse of discretion.\r\n\nAs it clearly was not, we reject the appeal and affirm.\r\n\n          To state  the facts briefly:  In  1993 the Hospital\r\n\nattempted to hire for a core Emergency Room nurse position an\r\n\nexternal candidate who was better qualified than any internal\r\n\ncandidate.   MNA grieved and the arbitrator held that where a\r\n\n\"qualified\"  internal candidate  was available,  the internal\r\n\ncandidate  must   be   hired   regardless   of   the   better\r\n\nqualifications of the external candidate.  The crux, for this\r\n\nappeal,  was in  the arbitrator's  finding that  the internal\r\n\ncandidate  was at  least \"minimally  qualified\" although  the\r\n\ncandidate  lacked  certification  in  Advanced  Cardiac  Life\r\n\nSupport (\"ACLS\"),  a  skill the  Hospital, not  unreasonably,\r\n\ndesired.  The arbitrator appeared to base this finding on the\r\n\ntestimony  of one witness, whom  the Hospital argued had said\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nno such thing.  The parties have represented to us that there\r\n\nwas no transcript of the arbitration proceedings.\r\n\n          The Hospital filed suit  in the U.S. District Court\r\n\nchallenging the  award.  Its essential argument  was that the\r\n\naward  was  based on  a \"non-fact\"  and  was in  violation of\r\n\npublic policy.  But  for the gross factual error made  by the\r\n\narbitrator  as   to  whether   the  internal   candidate  was\r\n\nqualified,  said the  Hospital, the  outcome would  have been\r\n\ndifferent.   The  Hospital  argued that  while  lack of  ACLS\r\n\nqualifications might  be tolerable among  non-core staff,  it\r\n\nwas unacceptable for a  core-staff nurse -- who would  be for\r\n\nsome  periods the  person  with  primary  responsibility  for\r\n\nEmergency  Room trauma and other cases -- not to be qualified\r\n\nin advanced  cardiac life  support techniques.   The Hospital\r\n\nargued  that the increased risk  to the health  and safety of\r\n\nEmergency Room  patients should  lead to invalidation  of the\r\n\narbitrator's award on public policy grounds.   Faced with the\r\n\ndeference given by  law to arbitral awards and  the lack of a\r\n\ntranscript, the district court  rejected the challenge on the\r\n\nmerits.  The Hospital has not appealed.\r\n\n          Nevertheless, MNA  has appealed, claiming  that the\r\n\ndistrict  court  was plainly  wrong  in not  awarding  it its\r\n\nattorneys'  fees  and costs  arising  out  of the  Hospital's\r\n\nchallenge to the award.  MNA argues that  United Paperworkers\r                                                                         \r\n\nInt'l Union v.
