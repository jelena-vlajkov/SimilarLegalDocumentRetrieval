We have reviewed  the parties' briefs  and\r                           \n\nthe record on appeal.   Appellant's retroactivity argument is\n\nclearly  foreclosed  by  our  decision in  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \n\nHavener, 905  F.2d 3 (1st Cir. 1990)  (holding that Amendment\r                   \n\n266 was not  retroactive).  His complaint  regarding the Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 32(a)(1) colloquy does not appear cognizable in a\n\n   2255 motion.   See  Hill  v. United  States, 368  U.S. 424\r                                                          \n\n(1962)  (holding   that  a  failure  to   follow  the  formal\n\nrequirements  of  Rule  32(a)  is  not  of  itself  an  error\n\ncognizable pursuant to    2255).  In any event,  that precise\n\nargument  also has  been considered previously  and rejected.\n\nUnited States v.  Manrique, 959 F.2d 1155,  1157-58 (1st Cir.\r                                      \n\n1992) (rejecting  claim that  district court  must personally\n\nask  defendant whether (a) he had the opportunity to read the\n\nPSR, (b) he  had discussed  report with counsel,  and (c)  he\n\nwished  to challenge the report).  The district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in  giving the government an enlargement\n\nof time in which to respond to the   2255 motion.\n\n     The   remainder  of   appellant's  claims   concern  the\n\napplication of  the sentencing guidelines.   Neither of these\n\nclaims  appears  to  implicate \"a  fundamental  defect  which\n\ninherently results in a  complete miscarriage of justice,\" so\n\nas to permit review  on collateral attack.
