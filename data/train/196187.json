Acquired  Immune Deficiency\r\n\nSyndrome.\"  Doctor Thoumes explicitly informed Revere that it was\r\n\n\"medically necessary\"  that Striesfield receive \"a  minimum of 12\r\n\nhours daily [nursing] care at his home,\" in administering medica-\r\n\ntions and  safeguarding him from  injury which might  result from\r\n\nhis unsteady gait and poor balance. \r\n\n          Nightingale  provided  the prescribed  nursing services\r\n\nafter obtaining  a valid assignment of  Striesfield's Revere Plan\r\n\nbenefits and after requesting Revere to verify the substance of a\r\n\ntelephone conversation in which, according to Nightingale, Revere\r\n\nhad \r\n\n          confirmed and authorized the  following bene-\r\n          fits, coverage and payment to [Nightingale] .\r\n          . . for Herbert Striesfield's nursing care:\r\n\n               (1)  Unlimited skilled nursing care.\r\n\n               (2)  Payment to  [Nightingale] for nurs-\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n                    ing care provided  upon receipt  of\r\n                    our  invoice will  be paid  at 100%\r\n                    for fees incurred.\r\n\n          [Nightingale]  understand[s]  that [its]  in-\r\n          voice must  be  attached to  a  physician[']s\r\n          Letter  of  Medical  Necessity  ordering  the\r\n          nursing care required and  nursing documenta-\r\n          tion.\r\n\nThe record contains no response from Revere.\r\n\n          Later,  Nightingale asked  Revere  to  confirm  another\r\n\ntelephone  conversation in  which,  according  to Nightingale,  a\r\n\nresponsible Revere  employee had \"stated that  [Revere] would pay\r\n\nfor  C.N.A.s [i.e.,  certified nurses  aides].\"   Nightingale re-\r\n\nquested a response within  five days in the event there  were any\r\n\ndiscrepancies between its letter and Revere's understanding as to\r\n\nthe substance of the putative telephone conversation.  The record\r\n\ncontains no response from Revere.\r\n\n          Under the  heading \"What We  Do Not Pay,\"  the relevant\r\n\nPlan language provided: \r\n\n          16.  Any  service,  supply or  treatment con-\r\n          nected with  custodial care.   We do  not pay\r\n          for these services or supplies no  matter who\r\n          provides, prescribes,  recommends or performs\r\n          them.   Custodial care means service designed\r\n          to  help family  members  meet  the needs  of\r\n          daily living  whether  they are  disabled  or\r\n          not.  These services include help in:\r\n\n               a.   walking  or getting  in and  out of\r\n                    bed;\r\n\n               b.   personal  care   such  as  bathing,\r\n                    dressing, eating  or preparing spe-\r\n                    cial diets; or\r\n\n               c.   taking medications which the family\r\n                    member  would  normally be  able to\r\n                    take without help.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nThe summary  judgment record discloses that  the nursing services\r\n\nprovided by Nightingale included:   feeding Striesfield, monitor-\r\n\ning  his diet, making him comfortable,  moving his extremities to\r\n\nimprove muscle tone, massage,  and assisting him to and  from the\r\n\nbathroom.\r\n\n          Early on, Revere  disbursed $3,250.00 in  Plan benefits\r\n\nto Nightingale.  Thereafter, however, in  reliance on the \"custo-\r\n\ndial  care\" exclusion, supra at  p. 3, Revere  denied all further\r                                      \r\n\nclaims based on Nightingale's nursing services to Striesfield. \r\n\n          Nightingale  eventually  brought  suit  in  the  United\r\n\nStates District Court  for the District of  Massachusetts.  After\r\n\nthe case  was referred  to a magistrate  judge, see  28 U.S.C.   \r                                                             \r\n\n636(b)(1)(B) (1995),  Revere moved for summary  judgment based on\r\n\nthe  \"custodial care\"  exclusion.   Nightingale filed  its cross-\r\n\nmotion for summary judgment and an opposition to Revere's summary\r\n\njudgment motion,  asserting that  the \"custodial  care\" exclusion\r\n\nwas \"vague and ambiguous\"  and that Revere's oral representations\r\n\nto Nightingale estopped Revere from denying coverage.  \r\n\n          The magistrate judge  recommended summary judgment  for\r\n\nRevere on the grounds that coverage was plainly foreclosed by the\r\n\n\"custodial care\"  exclusion and that Nightingale's estoppel claim\r\n\nwas  not cognizable  because the  alleged oral  representation or\r\n\ninformal writing upon which it relied could not be used to modify\r\n\nthe unambiguous  terms of  the Plan.    Nightingale filed  timely\r\n\nobjection  to the  magistrate-judge's report  and recommendation.\r\n\nIn due course, the  district court adopted the report  and recom-\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nmendation and Nightingale appealed.\r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\nA.

It  was accompanied  by evidence  purporting to\r\n\nshow that the nursing services provided to Striesfield \"included\"\r\n\nservices which  a reasonable  factfinder could  consider \"private\r\n\nduty nursing.\"   As a general  rule, parties are not  entitled to\r\n\nplenary review  of arguments  never raised before  the magistrate\r\n\njudge  designated  to  hear  and report  on  dispositive  motions\r\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C.   636(b)(1)(B).

The affidavit does not specify the types of nursing\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nservices  provided by  Nightingale,  nor  otherwise reveal  which\r\n\nnursing services, if any,  might constitute covered \"private duty\r\n\nnursing.\"  The burden  of producing competent evidence sufficient\r\n\nto  demonstrate a trialworthy issue  as to whether the particular\r\n\nservices rendered were covered  within the \"private duty nursing\"\r\n\nprovision  lay  with  Nightingale.

R. Evid. 801(c)  advisory commit-\r\n\ntee's note.  \r\n\n          At  no time  has  Nightingale suggested  that the  Plan\r\n\ndocument admitted  in evidence  is not  the document  executed by\r                                                \r\n\nStriesfield's  employer and  Revere.   Instead,  Nightingale  has\r\n\nfocused on  the lack  of personal  knowledge on  the part of  the\r\n\naffiant  who attested that  a copy of  the Plan  document was at-\r\n\ntached  to the affidavit.  Insofar as this represented an attempt\r\n\nto assert that the  Plan document was not duly  authenticated, it\r\n\nfails to assert  a basis for questioning the  affiant's statement\r\n\nthat the attached document is a copy of the Plan.  \r\n\n          Nightingale likewise objects to the Nightingale medical\r                                                                   \r\n\nrecords  Revere introduced  to  support its  contention that  the\r\n\nnursing  services  provided  by  Nightingale  were  custodial  in\r                                                                       \r\n\nnature.  As  a practical matter, of  course, this is an  argument\r\n\nNightingale cannot afford to win.   If Nightingale's own  nursing\r\n\nservices records were inadmissible,  there would appear to be  no\r\n\nneed  for Revere  to  justify its  disallowance of  Nightingale's\r\n\nclaims  under  the Plan.

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.\"  Doctor Thoumes explicitly informed Revere that it was \"medically necessary\" that Striesfield receive \"a minimum of 12 hours daily [nursing] care at his home,\" in administering medications and safeguarding him from injury which might result from his unsteady gait and poor balance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nightingale provided the prescribed nursing services after obtaining a valid assignment of Striesfield's Revere Plan benefits and after requesting Revere to verify the substance of a telephone conversation in which, according to Nightingale, Revere had</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>confirmed and authorized the following benefits, coverage and payment to [Nightingale] ... for Herbert Striesfield's nursing care:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>(1) Unlimited skilled nursing care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>(2) Payment to [Nightingale] for nursing care provided upon receipt of our invoice will be paid at 100% for fees incurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>[Nightingale] understand[s] that [its] invoice must be attached to a physician[']s Letter of Medical Necessity ordering the nursing care required and nursing documentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record contains no response from Revere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, Nightingale asked Revere to confirm another telephone conversation in which, according to Nightingale, a responsible Revere employee had \"stated that [Revere] would pay for C.N.A.s [i.e., certified nurses aides].\"  Nightingale requested a response within five days in the event there were any discrepancies between its letter and Revere's understanding as to the substance of the putative telephone conversation.

Thereafter, however, in reliance on the \"custodial care\" exclusion, supra at p. 3, Revere denied all further claims based on Nightingale's nursing services to Striesfield.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nightingale eventually brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  After the case was referred to a magistrate judge, see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(1)(B) (1995), Revere moved for summary judgment based on the \"custodial care\" exclusion.  Nightingale filed its cross-motion for summary judgment and an opposition to Revere's summary judgment motion, asserting that the \"custodial care\" exclusion was \"vague and ambiguous\" and that Revere's oral representations to Nightingale estopped Revere from denying coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge recommended summary judgment for Revere on the grounds that coverage was plainly foreclosed by the \"custodial care\" exclusion and that Nightingale's estoppel claim was not cognizable because the alleged oral representation or informal writing upon which it relied could not be used to modify the unambiguous terms of the Plan.  Nightingale filed timely objection to the magistrate-judge's report and recommendation.  In due course, the district court adopted the report and recommendation and Nightingale appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A.

Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 115 (1989).  As the Revere Plan vests no such discretion in the Plan administrator or fiduciary, we conduct plenary review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. \"Private Duty Nursing \"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plan provides that \"reasonable and customary charges\" shall be covered for \"[m]edically necessary private duty nursing ordered by the attending doctor to be provided by a licensed registered or licensed practical nurse.\"  Although the Plan does not define the term, Nightingale argues on appeal that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the services provided Striesfield constituted \"private duty nursing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument was asserted for the first time in Nightingale's objection to the magistrate-judge's report and recommendation.  It was accompanied by evidence purporting to show that the nursing services provided to Striesfield \"included\" services which a reasonable factfinder could consider \"private duty nursing.\"  As a general rule, parties are not entitled to plenary review of arguments never raised before the magistrate judge designated to hear and report on dispositive motions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(1)(B).  Paterson-Leitch Co., Inc. v. Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 990-91 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"We hold categorically that an unsuccessful party is not entitled as of right to de novo review by the judge of an argument never seasonably raised before the magistrate.\").  Although the district court did not explicitly rule upon the belated argument relating to the meaning of the term \"private duty nursing,\" we find no abuse of discretion.  See id. at 991 (finding no abuse of discretion in district court's decision to deny \"another nibble at this particular apple\" where party failed to present its claim to magistrate judge in first instance).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, however, the sole evidentiary underpinning for the unpreserved argument advanced on appeal is an affidavit reviewing the patient file Nightingale maintained on Striesfield.  The affidavit does not specify the types of nursing services provided by Nightingale, nor otherwise reveal which nursing services, if any, might constitute covered \"private duty nursing.\"  The burden of producing competent evidence sufficient to demonstrate a trialworthy issue as to whether the particular services rendered were covered within the \"private duty nursing\" provision lay with Nightingale.  See McCarthy v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., No. 94-2282, slip op. at 2 (1st Cir.  May 31, 1995) (party resisting summary judgment on issue as to which it bears ultimate burden of proof \"must affirmatively point to specific facts that demonstrate the existence of an authentic dispute.\");  Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1990) (same).  As the Nightingale affidavit failed its mission even assuming timeliness, there is no reason to suppose further indulgence would bear fruit.  See Paterson-Leitch, 840 F.2d at 991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. \"Custodial Care\" Exclusion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Plan defines \"custodial care\" as:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>service designed to help family members meet the needs of daily living whether they are disabled or not[, including:]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. walking or getting in and out of bed;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. personal care such as bathing, dressing, eating or preparing special diets;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. taking medication which the family member would normally be able to take without help.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence presented before the magistrate judge established that the nursing services provided by Nightingale came squarely within the \"custodial care\" exclusion:  preparation of special diet, feeding, performing foot massages, \"active and passive Range of Motion exercises,\" and assisting the patient to and from the bathroom.

See Fed.  R. Evid. 802.  We need not address Revere's response that the Plan document comes within the \"business records exception\" to the hearsay rule, see Fed.  R. Evid. 803(6), since the Plan document itself is not hearsay.  See Kepner-Tregoe, Inc. v. Leadership Software, Inc., 12 F.3d 527, 540 (5th Cir.)  (\"Signed instruments such as wills, contracts, and promissory notes are writings that have independent legal significance, and are nonhearsay.\")  (quoting Thomas A. Mauet, Fundamentals of Trial Techniques 180 (1988)), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 82 (1994).  Rather, the Plan constitutes a form of verbal act by Revere and Striesfield's employer.  Mueller v. Abdnor, 972 F.2d 931, 937 (8th Cir. 1992);  see also Kepner-Tregoe, 12 F.3d at 540;  2 John W. Strong et al., McCormick on Evidence Sec. 249, at 101 (4th ed. 1992).  The Federal Rules of Evidence explicitly \"exclude from hearsay the entire category of 'verbal acts' and 'verbal parts of an act,' in which the statement itself affects the legal rights of the parties or is a circumstance bearing on conduct affecting their rights.\"  Fed. R. Evid. 801(c) advisory committee's note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At no time has Nightingale suggested that the Plan document admitted in evidence is not the document executed by Striesfield's employer and Revere.  Instead, Nightingale has focused on the lack of personal knowledge on the part of the affiant who attested that a copy of the Plan document was attached to the affidavit.  Insofar as this represented an attempt to assert that the Plan document was not duly authenticated, it fails to assert a basis for questioning the affiant's statement that the attached document is a copy of the Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nightingale likewise objects to the Nightingale medical records Revere introduced to support its contention that the nursing services provided by Nightingale were custodial in nature.  As a practical matter, of course, this is an argument Nightingale cannot afford to win.  If Nightingale's own nursing services records were inadmissible, there would appear to be no need for Revere to justify its disallowance of Nightingale's claims under the Plan.  In all events, however, the nursing records Nightingale submitted to Revere constituted admissions of a party opponent, not hearsay, see Fed.  R. Evid. 801(d)(2);  see also United States v. Paulino, 13 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1994) (finding money order receipt an adoptive admission tending to prove appellant financed apartment used for drug distribution, where receipt was found in appellant's possession, bearing appellant's name and address, and labeled \"May rent\").  There was no abuse of discretion in denying Nightingale's motion to strike the nursing records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Nor would the untimely Nightingale affidavit have altered the \"custodial care\" exclusion ruling.

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.\"  Doctor Thoumes explicitly informed Revere that it was \"medically necessary\" that Striesfield receive \"a minimum of 12 hours daily [nursing] care at his home,\" in administering medications and safeguarding him from injury which might result from his unsteady gait and poor balance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nightingale provided the prescribed nursing services after obtaining a valid assignment of Striesfield's Revere Plan benefits and after requesting Revere to verify the substance of a telephone conversation in which, according to Nightingale, Revere had</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>confirmed and authorized the following benefits, coverage and payment to [Nightingale] ... for Herbert Striesfield's nursing care:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>(1) Unlimited skilled nursing care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>(2) Payment to [Nightingale] for nursing care provided upon receipt of our invoice will be paid at 100% for fees incurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>[Nightingale] understand[s] that [its] invoice must be attached to a physician[']s Letter of Medical Necessity ordering the nursing care required and nursing documentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record contains no response from Revere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, Nightingale asked Revere to confirm another telephone conversation in which, according to Nightingale, a responsible Revere employee had \"stated that [Revere] would pay for C.N.A.s [i.e., certified nurses aides].\"  Nightingale requested a response within five days in the event there were any discrepancies between its letter and Revere's understanding as to the substance of the putative telephone conversation.

After the case was referred to a magistrate judge, see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(1)(B) (1995), Revere moved for summary judgment based on the \"custodial care\" exclusion.  Nightingale filed its cross-motion for summary judgment and an opposition to Revere's summary judgment motion, asserting that the \"custodial care\" exclusion was \"vague and ambiguous\" and that Revere's oral representations to Nightingale estopped Revere from denying coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge recommended summary judgment for Revere on the grounds that coverage was plainly foreclosed by the \"custodial care\" exclusion and that Nightingale's estoppel claim was not cognizable because the alleged oral representation or informal writing upon which it relied could not be used to modify the unambiguous terms of the Plan.  Nightingale filed timely objection to the magistrate-judge's report and recommendation.  In due course, the district court adopted the report and recommendation and Nightingale appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A.

It was accompanied by evidence purporting to show that the nursing services provided to Striesfield \"included\" services which a reasonable factfinder could consider \"private duty nursing.\"  As a general rule, parties are not entitled to plenary review of arguments never raised before the magistrate judge designated to hear and report on dispositive motions pursuant to 28 U.S.C.

The affidavit does not specify the types of nursing services provided by Nightingale, nor otherwise reveal which nursing services, if any, might constitute covered \"private duty nursing.\"  The burden of producing competent evidence sufficient to demonstrate a trialworthy issue as to whether the particular services rendered were covered within the \"private duty nursing\" provision lay with Nightingale.  See McCarthy v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., No. 94-2282, slip op. at 2 (1st Cir.

See Fed.  R. Evid. 802.  We need not address Revere's response that the Plan document comes within the \"business records exception\" to the hearsay rule, see Fed.  R. Evid. 803(6), since the Plan document itself is not hearsay.  See Kepner-Tregoe, Inc. v. Leadership Software, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"659340\"><a href=\"/opinion/659340/kepner-tregoe-inc-v-leadership-software-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span>, 540 (5th Cir.)  (\"Signed instruments such as wills, contracts, and promissory notes are writings that have independent legal significance, and are nonhearsay.\")  (quoting Thomas A. Mauet, Fundamentals of Trial Techniques 180 (1988)), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span> </span>(1994).  Rather, the Plan constitutes a form of verbal act by Revere and Striesfield's employer.  Mueller v. Abdnor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588880\"><a href=\"/opinion/588880/marvin-mueller-v-james-abdnor-administrator-small-business/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span>, 937 (8th Cir. 1992);  see also <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"659340\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Kepner-Tregoe,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/659340/kepner-tregoe-inc-v-leadership-software-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span>;  2 John W. Strong et al., McCormick on Evidence Sec. 249, at 101 (4th ed. 1992).  The Federal Rules of Evidence explicitly \"exclude from hearsay the entire category of 'verbal acts' and 'verbal parts of an act,' in which the statement itself affects the legal rights of the parties or is a circumstance bearing on conduct affecting their rights.\"  Fed. R. Evid. 801(c) advisory committee's note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At no time has Nightingale suggested that the Plan document admitted in evidence is not the document executed by Striesfield's employer and Revere.  Instead, Nightingale has focused on the lack of personal knowledge on the part of the affiant who attested that a copy of the Plan document was attached to the affidavit.  Insofar as this represented an attempt to assert that the Plan document was not duly authenticated, it fails to assert a basis for questioning the affiant's statement that the attached document is a copy of the Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nightingale likewise objects to the Nightingale medical records Revere introduced to support its contention that the nursing services provided by Nightingale were custodial in nature.  As a practical matter, of course, this is an argument Nightingale cannot afford to win.  If Nightingale's own nursing services records were inadmissible, there would appear to be no need for Revere to justify its disallowance of Nightingale's claims under the Plan.  In all events, however, the nursing records Nightingale submitted to Revere constituted admissions of a party opponent, not hearsay, see Fed.  R. Evid. 801(d)(2);  see also United States v. Paulino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195130\"><a href=\"/opinion/195130/united-states-v-paulino/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir. 1994) (finding money order receipt an adoptive admission tending to prove appellant financed apartment used for drug distribution, where receipt was found in appellant's possession, bearing appellant's name and address, and labeled \"May rent\").  There was no abuse of discretion in denying Nightingale's motion to strike the nursing records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Nor would the untimely Nightingale affidavit have altered the \"custodial care\" exclusion ruling.  The affidavit does not state whether the listed services were among those previously reimbursed by Revere in the amount of $3,250, nor does it reflect the dollar amount claimed for the services purportedly qualifying as \"private duty nursing.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
