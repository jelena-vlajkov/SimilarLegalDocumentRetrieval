Appellants Perez and  Lopez were\n          CYR, Circuit  Judge.\n                             \n\narrested and  detained in  connection with separate  incidents on\n\nJuly 31, 1990, in Santurce, Puerto Rico, and charged with selling\n\ncocaine.  Both  were released  on bail after  being detained  for\n\nless  than twenty-four hours.  Perez was acquitted in August 1991\n\nand  the Lopez charges were  dismissed \"for lack  of evidence\" in\n\nMarch 1992.\n\n          On June 24, 1992, plaintiffs-appellants  brought virtu-\n\nally identical  civil rights actions under 42 U.S.C.   1983, with\n\npendent commonwealth  law claims,  essentially alleging  that the\n\ncocaine  charges  were  trumped  up.    Defendants-appellees  are\n\nvarious  law enforcement  officers and  officials of  the Common-\n\nwealth of Puerto Rico allegedly involved in arresting and  prose-\n\ncuting appellants.  The complaint asserts claims of false arrest,\n\nfalse  imprisonment,  and   malicious  prosecution.    Appellants\n\nfurther  claim that  the  alleged civil  rights infractions  were\n\nelements  of a  larger  conspiracy against  appellants and  other\n\nbusinessmen.1  \n\n                    \n\n     1Appellants urge that  we treat the alleged conspiracy  as a\n\"continuing violation.\"  We need not address this contention.  In\nview of our conclusion that appellants failed to plead an action-\nable claim  for malicious  prosecution, their  time-barred claims\nfor false arrest and  false imprisonment in 1990 cannot  be saved\nby any subsequent termination of their invalid malicious prosecu-\ntion claims.   See Mack v. Great American Atlantic  &amp; Pacific Tea\n                                                                 \nCo., 871 F.2d 179,  183 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"In  short, [continuing]\n   \nviolation or  no, plaintiff retained the  burden of demonstrating\nthat  some [violation]  transpired  within the  appropriate  time\n          \nframe.\").\n\n                                3\n\n          The Lopez and Perez  actions were assigned to different\n\ndistrict judges.  Defendants-appellees filed  essentially identi-\n\ncal motions to dismiss on the ground that the section 1983 claims\n\nwere time-barred  under the  applicable one-year  limitation bor-\n\nrowed from commonwealth law.   See Lafont-Rivera v. Soler-Zapata,\n                                                                \n\n984 F.2d 1,  3 (1st Cir. 1993).  After  the district court denied\n\nthe  motion to  dismiss  the Lopez  action,  the two  cases  were\n\nconsolidated  under Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 42,  and docketed  to Judge\n\nGierbolini who  eventually dismissed  the consolidated action  on\n\nthe grounds that the  false imprisonment and false  arrest claims\n\nwere  time-barred and the complaint failed to state an actionable\n\nsection  1983  claim for  malicious  prosecution,  see Torres  v.\n                                                             \n\nSuperintendent of Police, 893 F.2d 404, 409 (1st Cir. 1990) (only\n                        \n\n\"egregious\"  misconduct  implicates    1983   remedy;  \"malicious\n\nprosecution standing alone does not implicate federally protected\n\nrights\").\n\n          Appellants first  challenge the dismissal order  on the\n\nground that  the earlier district court ruling denying the motion\n\nto dismiss  in the Lopez action  became the \"law of  the case\" in\n\nthe consolidated action.

Torres, 893  F.2d at 409.   (\"[T]o state  a claim\n                      \n\nunder section 1983, the complaint must assert that the  malicious\n\nconduct was so  egregious that it violated  substantive or proce-\n\ndural due  process rights under  the Fourteenth Amendment.\")   An\n\nactionable section  1983 malicious  prosecution claim based  on a\n\n                                5\n\nsubstantive  due process  deprivation  must  allege  \"conscience-\n\nshocking\" conduct  by  the defendants.    Id. at  410  (citations\n                                             \n\nomitted).   A  procedural  due process  claim  is not  actionable\n\nunless,  inter alia,  no  adequate  \"post-deprivation remedy\"  is\n                   \n\navailable under state law.  Id.\n                               \n\n          Neither  their  appellate  brief nor  their  complaints\n\nidentify the due process theory undergirding appellants'  section\n\n1983 malicious  prosecution claim.    Nevertheless, the  district\n\ncourt's  analysis and  application  of Torres,  which stated  the\n                                             \n\ncontrolling law of this circuit at the time this  case was decid-\n\ned, seems  entirely correct.   Since then,  moreover, appellants'\n\nposition has become  even less  tenable in light  of the  Supreme\n\nCourt's  decision in Albright v.  Oliver, 114 S.  Ct. 807 (1994).\n                                        \n\nAlbright would appear virtually to foreclose reliance on substan-\n        \n\ntive  due process as the basis for a viable malicious prosecution\n\nclaim under section 1983    superseding even Torres' very limited\n                                                   \n\ntolerance  of reliance on  substantive due process  in this area.\n\nFour  Justices  concluded  that  a section  1983  claim  alleging\n\nmalicious   prosecution  cannot  be  predicated  on  \"open-ended\"\n\nconceptions  of  substantive due  process.    See  id. at  810-19\n                                                      \n\n(Opinion  of Rehnquist,  C.J.,  joined by  O'Connor, Scalia,  and\n\nGinsburg, JJ.).2   Moreover, two Justices, in  a concurring opin-\n\n                    \n\n     2The Albright  plurality summarized its position  at the end\n                  \nof footnote 4, 114 S.

(Opinion\n                                            \n\nof  Kennedy, J.,  joined by  Thomas, J.).   Justice Souter,  in a\n\nseparate concurrence, concluded that Albright had demonstrated no\n\ndistinct injury from the  alleged malicious prosecution, and that\n\nhis custody-based  claims were better addressed  under the Fourth\n\nAmendment.  See id. at 819-22 (Opinion of Souter, J.).\n                   \n\n          Lastly,  the  availability of  an  adequate remedy  for\n\nmalicious prosecution under commonwealth law, see P. R.

Sec. 1983, with pendent commonwealth law claims, essentially alleging that the cocaine charges were trumped up.  Defendants-appellees are various law enforcement officers and officials of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico allegedly involved in arresting and prosecuting appellants.  The complaint asserts claims of false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution.  Appellants further claim that the alleged civil rights infractions were elements of a larger conspiracy against appellants and other businessmen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Lopez and Perez actions were assigned to different district judges.
