Upon  review of the entire  record, we\r                                \r\n\nagree that  the complaint  was properly dismissed  and affirm\r\n\nessentially  for  the  reasons  stated  in  the  magistrate's\r\n\nDecember  19,  1994,  report  and  recommendation  which  was\r\n\nadopted by the  district court.  Cok  v. Forte, 877  F. Supp.\r                                                          \r\n\n797 (D.R.I. 1995).  We are also persuaded that the imposition\r\n\nof a  narrow, well-defined  injunction against  plaintiff Cok\r\n\nwas  justified.    The  basis  for  the  injunction  is  well\r\n\nsupported  in the record.  The filing restrictions set out in\r\n\nthe order are  grounded in a  comprehensive history of  Cok's\r\n\nten-years of litigation,  were entered after  notice, hearing\r\n\nand  the  opportunity  to   object,  and  are   unambiguously\r\n\n\"tailored to  the specific circumstances presented.\"   Cok v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nFamily  Court  of Rhode  Island, 985  F.2d  32, 34  (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1993).\r\n\n          We  add  these  additional  comments.    Plaintiffs\r\n\ncontend that they never consented to have their case heard by\r\n\na magistrate-judge, that the magistrate exceeded the scope of\r\n\nhis authority and  that the district  judge, in adopting  the\r\n\nmagistrate's recommended disposition, including  the proposed\r\n\ninjunction, failed to conduct a de novo review as mandated by\r\n\n28 U.S.C.    636(b)(1)(C).  First,  while a magistrate  lacks\r\n\nauthority to  issue a  dispositive order, including  an order\r\n\nallowing an injunction, without the consent of the parties to\r\n\na decision by  a magistrate, 28  U.S.C.   636(c)(1),  section\r\r\n\n636(b)(1)(B) permits a district  judge to refer a  motion for\r\n\ninjunctive relief to a  magistrate for a proposed disposition\r\n\nwithout the  parties' consent.   Here, the  magistrate merely\r\n\nrecommended the imposition of an injunction; he did not order\r\n\nit.    Second,  plaintiffs  filed timely  objections  to  the\r\n\nmagistrate's report.  In  accepting that report, the district\r\n\ncourt especially noted and approved the wording of the narrow\r\n\ninjunction proposed by the magistrate.  The docket shows that\r\n\nthe district  judge had, on  a number of  occasions, examined\r\n\nCok's claims before  referring them  to the  magistrate.   We\r\n\nwill not presume, in  the absence of  contrary  indicia, that\r\n\nthe district  court conducted anything other  than a complete\r\n\nreview of  the record.  See United States v. Hamell, 931 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n466, 468 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S.
