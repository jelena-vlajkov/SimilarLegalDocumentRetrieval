(Damar)\r\n\noperated  a job  shop  in Somersworth,  New  Hampshire, where  it\r\n\ncrafted  custom  components  for   high-technology  applications.\r\n\nPlaintiff-appellant Kathy Smith joined Damar in 1976 and advanced\r\n\nsteadily through  the ranks  until she  reached  the position  of\r\n\nproduction  manager  almost a  decade later.   In  that capacity,\r\n\nSmith scheduled production  runs and coordinated delivery  dates.\r\n\nIn late  1987, after an  imbroglio with Darrol  Robinson (Damar's\r\n\nowner   and  general   manager),   she  requested   and  obtained\r\n\nreassignment  to a  different post  having no  responsibility for\r\n\nproduction scheduling.\r\n\n          On December  23, 1988, defendant-appellee F.W.  Morse &amp;\r\n\nCo., Inc. (Morse), a  firm owned by Chris Bond,  acquired Damar's\r\n\nbusiness  and assets.  Damar then had fewer than forty employees,\r\n\nincluding seven managers reporting directly to Robinson:  Michael\r\n\nHickman  (production  control);  Robert  Lane  (shipping); Ronald\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nParadis (production/machining);  Marc Shevenell (production/sheet\r\n\nmetal); Gary Bickford (engineering);  Michael Seeger (sales); and\r\n\nSmith.    Though  not  titled,  Smith  testified  that   she  was\r\n\nconsidered  to  be a  de facto  manager  who, largely  because of\r\n\nHickman's  inadequacies,  performed many  of  the  duties of  the\r\n\nproduction control manager.\r\n\n          Bond promptly concluded that  Damar had too many chiefs\r\n\nand  too few  Indians.   Within  days of  the  closing, he  fired\r\n\nHickman.   Then, in concert with Maryann Guimond, the new general\r\n\nmanager  (who  had  authority   to  hire,  fire,  and  discipline\r\n\npersonnel),  he  interviewed  a  number  of employees,  including\r\n\nSmith.   In the aftermath  of this review,  the company cashiered\r\n\nLane.   To  fill  the void  created  by the  two  executive-level\r\n\ndepartures, Morse promoted Smith to the newly created position of\r\n\nmaterials manager, consolidating responsibilities for scheduling,\r\n\nproduction  control, inventory control, purchasing, shipping, and\r\n\nreceiving that had previously been spread among three managers.\r\n\n          All  told,  Morse's   initial  reorganization   efforts\r\n\nsubstituted  Guimond  for   Robinson  and  pared   second-echelon\r\n\nmanagement  from  seven to  five.   In  addition to  Guimond, the\r\n\nreconfigured  management  team  comprised   Paradis  (machining);\r\n\nShevenell  (sheet metal); Bickford (engineering); Seeger (sales);\r\n\nand  Smith  (materials).   In  recognition  of Smith's  increased\r\n\nresponsibilities, Morse  twice hiked her pay (once in January and\r\n\nagain in March),  thus increasing her  weekly stipend by  roughly\r\n\ntwenty-five percent.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          At about the time of the takeover, Smith informed  Bond\r\n\nthat  she had become pregnant  and would need  a maternity leave.\r\n\nMorse,  a tiny  company,  had no  formal maternity  leave policy.\r\n\nBond nonetheless honored Smith's request and assured her that her\r\n\nposition  was \"secure.\"  In preparation for her leave, Smith held\r\n\nseveral  meetings  with Guimond,  Shevenell,  and  Paradis.   The\r\n\ncompany temporarily distributed her managerial duties among other\r\n\nsupervisors  and  arranged  for a  newly-hired  secretary,  Kelly\r\n\nGilday,  to  perform her  clerical  functions.   Along  the  way,\r\n\nGuimond informed  Smith that  either Paradis or  Shevenell likely\r\n\nwould  be discharged,  and told  her that  she would  be promoted\r\n\nagain  upon  her  return  from  maternity  leave.   Guimond  also\r\n\nindicated that,  in all  probability, Bickford would  be demoted,\r\n\nand Smith  would  be asked  to assume  a portion  of his  duties.\r\n\nWhile   these   changes   presumably  would   warrant   increased\r\n\nremuneration, Guimond did not mention an amount.\r\n\n          On  April 7,  1989,  Smith began  her maternity  leave,\r\n\nplanning to  return to work in approximately six weeks.  She gave\r\n\nbirth two weeks later.  Meanwhile, Guimond, expecting the \"sky to\r\n\nfall,\" held  regular \"reality check\" meetings  with Shevenell and\r\n\nParadis.   To  her  surprise, the  plant  functioned very  well.1\r\n\nGuimond reported the good news to Bond.\r\n\n          Smith visited the plant on  May 1 and informed  Guimond\r\n\nthat  she  wished  to  return  to  work  one  week  earlier  than\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1During  this same  time frame,  the company  eliminated the\r\nengineering manager's position.  However, Bickford remained  with\r\nMorse in a lesser capacity.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\noriginally  anticipated.   Guimond inquired  about whether  Smith\r\n\ndesired  more children,  and  Smith replied  affirmatively.   The\r\n\nfollowing day, Guimond queried  Karen Vendasi, Smith's sister and\r\n\nco-worker,  about Smith's plans to have a larger family.  Vendasi\r\n\nrelayed this conversation to Smith and told her of nascent rumors\r\n\nto the effect that she might not return to work.  Smith contacted\r\n\nGuimond  and  demanded  an   explanation.    Guimond  denied  any\r\n\nknowledge  of the rumors, dismissed them as idle buzznacking, and\r\n\nagain  assured Smith that her  job was secure.   Guimond repeated\r\n\nthese assurances during a chance meeting on May 4.\r\n\n          A few days later,  Guimond concluded that the materials\r\n\nmanager's position  was superfluous and decided  to eliminate it.\r\n\nShe told Smith of her decision on May 11.   During this telephone\r\n\nconversation, Guimond asked Smith if  she preferred people to  be\r\n\ntold that she  had decided to stay at home  with her infant child\r\n\nrather than that  she had  been discharged.   Smith rejected  the\r\n\nsuggestion.  Nevertheless, a  Morse employee repeated this canard\r\n\nto several customers.2\r\n\n          Following Smith's  severance, Guimond gave  most of her\r\n\nduties  to Paradis  in his  new capacity  as operations  manager.\r\n\nShevenell assumed the role of manufacturing manager (in charge of\r\n\nboth  machining and sheet metal work).  Guimond also promoted two\r\n\nlower-ranking  employees, Peter  Lapanne  and  Brian Hoffman,  to\r\n\nassistant  manager  positions (though  evidence adduced  at trial\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The company  reprimanded the employee  and trial  testimony\r\ntended to establish that Morse had not authorized the comments.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\ndemonstrated that Lapanne  had been an  assistant manager as  far\r\n\nback   as  1984,   and   that  neither   man   assumed  any   new\r\n\nresponsibilities or received  any salary  increase in  connection\r\n\nwith  his new title).   Gilday continued to  perform the clerical\r\n\nfunctions  associated with  Smith's  former position.   When  the\r\n\nsecond round  of the  reorganization wound  down,  the plant  had\r\n\nthree second-echelon managers    Paradis (operations);  Shevenell\r\n\n(manufacturing); and  Seeger (sales)    in lieu  of the  original\r\n\nseven.\r\n\n                     B.  Procedural History.\r                               B.  Procedural History.\r                                                     \r\n\n          Smith  sued  Morse  in  a  New  Hampshire  state  court\r\n\nalleging,  inter   alia,  wrongful  discharge   based  on  gender\r                                 \r\n\ndiscrimination, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and\r\n\nbreach of contract.   Morse removed the case to  federal district\r\n\ncourt on the ground  that Smith's claim \"arose under\"  Title VII,\r\n\nthus prompting federal question  jurisdiction.  See 28  U.S.C.   \r                                                             \r\n\n1331,   1343(c)(3),  1441,  1446;  see  also  28  U.S.C.     1367\r                                                      \r\n\n(conferring  ancillary  jurisdiction  over   appended  nonfederal\r\n\nclaims).   Smith thereafter filed an amended  complaint that made\r\n\nher Title VII claim explicit.\r\n\n          Early  in the  proceedings,  Morse  moved  for  partial\r\n\nsummary judgment.   The  district court  (Stahl, J.) granted  the\r\n\nmotion  on  the  common  law  wrongful  discharge  and  emotional\r\n\ndistress claims.  See  Smith v. F.W. Morse  &amp; Co., No.  90-361-S,\r                                                           \r\n\nslip op. at 12 (D.N.H.

The  Title VII  case proceeded  before the\r\n\ndistrict judge.   Morse asserted  that it scrapped  the materials\r\n\nmanager's  position  and laid  off the  appellant  as part  of an\r\n\noverarching   strategy  to  streamline   a  top-heavy  managerial\r\n\nstructure, and that even if Smith had not been on maternity leave\r\n\nshe would have been flattened by the downsizing steamroller.  The\r\n\ndistrict  court agreed  and  entered judgment  accordingly.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nSmith v.  F.W. Morse  &amp; Co.,  901 F.

Since the events\r\nthat  form the basis of  the appellant's claim  occurred prior to\r\nthe effective date of  the 1991 Act, she  had no right to  a jury\r\ntrial on her  Title VII claim.

The PDA made clear that:\r\n\n          The terms  \"because of sex\" or  \"on the basis\r\n          of sex\"  include,  but are  not  limited  to,\r\n          because  of or  on  the  basis of  pregnancy,\r\n          childbirth,  or  related medical  conditions;\r\n          and women affected by  pregnancy, childbirth,\r\n          or  related  medical   conditions  shall   be\r\n          treated the same  for all  employment-related\r\n          purposes, including receipt of benefits under\r\n          fringe benefit programs, as other persons not\r\n          so affected  but similar in their  ability or\r\n          inability to work.\r\n\n42  U.S.C.   2000e(k).  Thus, at  the time Smith and Morse parted\r\n\ncompany,  Title VII's  ban on  gender  discrimination encompassed\r\n\npregnancy-based discrimination.\r\n\n          Like other  Title VII plaintiffs, an  employee claiming\r\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of pregnancy may proceed under either\r\n\na  disparate  treatment  or  a  disparate  impact  theory.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\ngenerally Furnco Constr. Corp. v.

Under  this framework,  a\r                  \r\n\nplaintiff  can   establish  a  prima  facie   case  of  pregnancy\r\n\ndiscrimination  by  showing that  (1)  she  is pregnant  (or  has\r\n\nindicated  an   intention  to  become  pregnant),   (2)  her  job\r\n\nperformance   has  been  satisfactory,   but  (3)   the  employer\r\n\nnonetheless  dismissed her from her position  (or took some other\r\n\nadverse employment  action against  her) while (4)  continuing to\r\n\nhave her duties performed by a comparably qualified person.

In  those cases, direct\r                                 \r\n\nevidence  of discriminatory  motive    say, an  admission by  the\r\n\nemployer that it explicitly  took actual or anticipated pregnancy\r\n\ninto account in reaching an employment decision   serves to shift\r\n\nthe burden of persuasion  from employee to employer.   The latter\r\n\nmust  then affirmatively prove that  it would have  made the same\r\n\ndecision even if  it had not  taken the protected  characteristic\r\n\ninto account.  See Price Waterhouse v.

We have here a good example  of such\r\n\na  prudential approach.   The  trial  court largely  bypassed any\r\n\ndifferential  direct  evidence/circumstantial evidence  tamisage,\r\n\npreferring to go directly to a  finding that, on the totality  of\r\n\nthe   evidence   presented,   Morse   had   proven  that   gender\r\n\ndiscrimination did not trigger the firing.  See Smith II, 901  F.\r                                                                  \r\n\nSupp. at 44-45.  This approach negates any need for  us to pursue\r\n\nthe question of an analytic  framework to a definite  conclusion.\r\n\nWhile we  agree with our concurring colleague that the decisional\r\n\nprocess  is  important,  there comes  a  point  at which  slavish\r\n\ninsistence upon process for its own sake serves only to exalt the\r\n\ntrappings  of justice  over its  substance.   Here, the  district\r\n\ncourt's finding on causation,  if sustainable, resolves the Title\r\n\nVII claim whether  the appellant's prima facie  case arises under\r\n\nthe  McDonnell Douglas or Price  Waterhouse paradigm.   And as we\r                                                     \r\n\nillustrate  below, see  infra  Part III(C),  that finding  passes\r                                       \r\n\nmuster.\r\n\n                         C.

The court  found that  Morse  carried the  devoir of\r\n\npersuasion on  this  pivotal issue.   It  concluded that  Morse's\r\n\ndecision was  \"motivated by business judgment  and represented an\r\n\neffort to economize  by placing the  most qualified personnel  in\r\n\nthe fewest number  of managerial positions possible, and  was not\r\n\nbased on  plaintiff's gender, pregnancy, or  her expressed desire\r\n\nto have more children.\"  Smith II, 901 F. Supp. at 44.  The court\r                                           \r\n\nalso  concluded  \"that  even  if   Guimond  is  assumed  to  have\r\n\nconsidered impermissible gender-based  factors, the same decision\r\n\nto  eliminate plaintiff's position would  still have been made at\r\n\nthe same  time\" for reasons of business necessity.

See Goldman,  985  F.2d  at  1118 n.4;\r                                                \r\n\nMaresco v.

Supp. at 268-69.\r                                              \r\n\n          Against this  backdrop,  we believe  that the  evidence\r\n\nadequately supports the trial court's findings.  When Morse  took\r\n\nover, Damar had an inordinately high ratio of managers to workers\r\n\nand the  managers' responsibilities  overlapped.5  Both  Bond and\r\n\nGuimond testified  that from  the very  start they believed  that\r\n\nDamar's  sprawling  organizational  structure  defied   rhyme  or\r\n\nreason.   Accordingly,  they  set out  to  compress some  of  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5To  cite an  example,  Damar split  the responsibility  for\r\nmanufacturing  between two  managers  (Shevenell and  Paradis), a\r\nsituation that, in appellant's own phrase, caused daily \"chaos.\"\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nsprawl.  The district court credited their intention, noting that\r\n\nthe witnesses' actions  matched their stated objective.   More to\r\n\nthe point,  Guimond testified  that she terminated  the appellant\r\n\n\"because  I had  a position that  I no  longer felt  needed to be\r\n\nfilled.\"   Bond testified in  the same vein,  indicating that he,\r\n\ntoo, had  become convinced that Smith's  position was expendable.\r\n\nThe court  accepted this evidence, concluding  that the materials\r\n\nmanager's  position would  have been  eliminated within  the same\r\n\ntime frame whether or not Smith had taken a maternity leave.\r\n\n          In our view, this determination,  while not inevitable,\r\n\nis supportable.  In the first place, the record strongly suggests\r\n\nthat, in fact, the position was expendable.  In the second place,\r\n\nany other  choice  would  have entailed  a  loss  of  engineering\r\n\nexpertise that Damar could ill afford.6  In  the third place, the\r\n\ncourt's  view is  bolstered by  the reception that  the appellant\r\n\noriginally received from  the new  ownership.   Bond and  Guimond\r\n\napprised  her   of  the  planned  downsizing   and  assigned  her\r\n\nsignificant  new   responsibilities  when  other   managers  were\r\n\ndismissed.     They   also   promoted  her   and  increased   her\r\n\ncompensation.  These actions, undertaken with full knowledge that\r\n\nthe  appellant  was  pregnant  and  would  be  taking a  six-week\r\n\nmaternity leave,  are inconsistent  with a bias  against pregnant\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Bond  testified  that he  purchased  Damar  to acquire  its\r\nengineering talents.   Paradis and Shevenell  were highly trained\r\nand experienced  engineers, while Smith had  no such credentials.\r\nWhen Morse  discovered  that  it  could function  with  one  less\r\nmanager,  the  decision  to  retain Paradis  and  Shevenell,  and\r\ndismiss Smith, seems quite plausible.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nemployees.  In the  fourth place, the district judge,  sitting as\r\n\nthe trier of fact,  had the right to credit Bond's testimony that\r\n\nthe \"maternity leave never  played a role in itself\"  because the\r\n\nsame  decision \"would have been made in a very close time frame,\"\r\n\nand Guimond's testimony  to like effect.  In a  bench trial, such\r\n\ncredibility judgments are the  judge's prerogative.  See Anthony,\r                                                                          \r\n\n952 F.2d at 606.\r\n\n          To be sure,  the record could support a  less innocuous\r\n\nconclusion.   The chronal proximity of  Guimond's questions anent\r\n\nSmith's plans to have more children and her dismissal,  Guimond's\r\n\nill-advised suggestion that customers  and employees be told that\r\n\nSmith  decided to  stay at  home  to care  for her  daughter, and\r\n\nSmith's  termination while on maternity  leave are troubling   so\r\n\nmuch so  that  we, if  free  to write  a palimpsest,  might  have\r\n\ncharacterized   the  impetus   behind   the  appellant's   ouster\r\n\ndifferently.  But  whether the  trial court could  have drawn  an\r\n\ninference  of discriminatory intent is not the test.  See Foster,\r                                                                          \r\n\n71 F.3d at 55; Keyes,  853 F.2d at 1027.   As long as a  contrary\r                              \r\n\ninference is also supportable   and  that is the situation here  \r\n\nthen it is for the trial court, not the court of appeals, to call\r\n\nthe tune.   After all, \"when there  are two permissible  views of\r\n\nthe  evidence, the  factfinder's  choice between  them cannot  be\r\n\nclearly erroneous.\"  Johnson, 63 F.3d at 1138 (citing Anderson v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nCity of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985)).\r                               \r\n\n          In  an effort to evade the force of this principle, the\r\n\nappellant hauls two further  arguments from her bag.   First, she\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nasseverates that Morse  did not in  fact eliminate her  position,\r\n\nand that the district court's contrary finding, see Smith II, 901\r                                                                      \r\n\nF. Supp. at 43,  is itself clearly erroneous.   This asseveration\r\n\nleads down a blind alley.\r\n\n          When  an employer defends  an employment discrimination\r\n\ncase on the ground of position elimination, the position may not,\r\n\nlike a Dali painting, fade from one image to another only for the\r\n\nfirst  image to reemerge  at the blink  of an eye.   See Gallo v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nPrudential Residential  Servs., Ltd.

Yet,  a  position elimination  defense is  not defeated\r\n\nmerely  because  another employee,  already  on  the payroll,  is\r\n\ndesignated  to  carry out  some or  all  of the  fired employee's\r\n\nduties  in addition  to  his own,  or  because those  duties  are\r\n\notherwise  reallocated  within  the  existing work  force.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nLeBlanc,  6  F.3d  at  846;  Barnes,  896  F.2d  at  1465.    The\r                                             \r\n\nelimination of a position signifies the employer's belief that it\r\n\ncan get by with one less helper; it does not necessarily convey a\r\n\nbelief  that the work the employee had been doing was superfluous\r\n\nand need not be performed at all.\r\n\n          Here, the undisputed evidence before the district court\r\n\nindicates that  after Guimond dismissed Smith,  the position that\r\n\nSmith  had occupied    materials  manager   fell  into desuetude.\r\n\nThere is no basis in the record for a suggestion  that Lapanne or\r\n\nHoffman  assumed  any of  the  appellant's  former duties;  those\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nduties, which Paradis, Shevenell, and Gilday had performed during\r\n\nSmith's leave, continued to  be performed by them (or,  at least,\r\n\nby Paradis  and  Gilday).   In  short, the  second round  of  the\r\n\nreorganization  (which  cost  Smith  her  job)  bore  a  striking\r\n\nresemblance to the first round (which gave Smith her promotion to\r\n\nmaterials  manager).   Given  these facts,  the district  judge's\r\n\ndetermination that Morse eliminated  the appellant's position  is\r\n\nunimpugnable.\r\n\n          The  appellant next  endeavors  to  surmount the  sharp\r\n\nescarpment of the clearly erroneous rule by casting a hook at the\r\n\nlegal  standard  applied  by   the  trial  court.    This   is  a\r\n\ntheoretically  sound  way  to  climb  the  mountain,  see,  e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nReliance Steel Prods.  Co. v.

The  appellant's  thesis is  as\r\n\nfollows.   She  says that  Title VII  prohibits an  employer from\r\n\ndismissing  an employee while she  is on maternity  leave even if\r\n\nthe  employer, in  the process of  rationalizing its  work force,\r\n\ndiscovers that  her position is  redundant and eliminates  it for\r\n\nthat reason.\r\n\n          Refined  to bare  essence, this  thesis suggests  that,\r\n\nsince Morse would not have discovered the redundancy at that time\r\n\n(if ever) but for the fact that Smith took a maternity leave, the\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nleave brought about the  firing.7  And the appellant  attempts to\r\n\ndrive this point  home by citing Bond's  testimony that \"because\"\r\n\nSmith was out on maternity leave, Morse was able to discover that\r\n\nher  position  was expendable     testimony  which the  appellant\r\n\noptimistically equates with an admission that Morse dismissed her\r\n\n\"because\" of her pregnancy.   With respect, we believe  that this\r\n\nargument, which seeks to apply a  black-letter legal principle in\r\n\na  totally   mechanical  fashion,  plays  mischievously   on  the\r\n\nmendacity of language by substituting sound for sense.\r\n\n          It  is settled under Title VII that an employer may not\r\n\ndischarge  an  employee based  on  the  categorical fact  of  her\r\n\npregnancy.  See Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC,\r                                                                          \r\n\n462 U.S. 669, 684 (1983); Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at 153.  By the same\r                                            \r\n\ntoken, since a short-term inability to work is  bound up with the\r\n\nvery  nature of  pregnancy and  childbirth, that disability  is a\r\n\npregnancy-related  condition within  the meaning  of 42  U.S.C.  \r\n\n2000e(k),  and   Title  VII  thus  prohibits   an  employer  from\r\n\ndismissing an  employee in  retaliation for taking  an authorized\r\n\nmaternity leave.  Nevertheless, under the PDA, pregnancy does not\r\n\nconfer total  immunity.8  An  employer may discharge  an employee\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7We  note  in  passing  that the  appellant's  reasoning  is\r\nhopelessly  circular.   Morse demonstrated  a firm  commitment to\r\ndownsizing and actively sought ways to streamline its operations.\r\nConsequently,  there is no  basis for surmising  that Morse would\r\nhave failed to realize that the materials manager's position  was\r\nsuperfluous whether or not Smith took a maternity leave.\r\n\n     8We stress that  this case  is brought pursuant  to, and  is\r\ngoverned  by,  Title VII.   If  the  recently enacted  Family and\r\nMedical  Leave  Act  of 1993,  P.L.  103-3,  107  Stat. 6  (1993)\r\n(codified at 29 U.S.C.    2601-2654) were applicable, a different\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\nwhile  she is  pregnant  if it  does  so for  legitimate  reasons\r\n\nunrelated  to  her pregnancy.   See,  e.g.,  Troupe v.

It follows, then,\r\n\nthat an  employer may  discharge an  employee while  she is  on a\r\n\npregnancy-induced  leave so  long as  it does  so for  legitimate\r\n\nreasons unrelated to her gravidity.\r\n\n          Harmonizing these  principles  leads to  the  following\r\n\nconclusions.  Title  VII mandates  that an employer  must put  an\r\n\nemployee's pregnancy (including her departure on maternity leave)\r\n\nto one side in making its employment decisions    but the statute\r\n\ndoes not command  that an employer bury its head  in the sand and\r\n\nstruthiously  refrain from implementing business judgments simply\r\n\nbecause they affect a  parturient employee.  See Troupe,  20 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 738  (holding that the PDA \"requires the employer to ignore an\r\n\nemployee's  pregnancy, but  . .  . not  her absence  from work\");\r\n\nCrnokrak v.

Ill.  1993)  (stating that  \"the  PDA does  not  force\r\n\nemployers to  pretend that absent employees  are present whenever\r\n\ntheir absences are caused  by pregnancy\").  At bottom,  Title VII\r\n\nrequires  a causal nexus between the employer's state of mind and\r\n\nthe  protected trait  (here,  pregnancy).   The mere  coincidence\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nset of rules would obtain.\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nbetween that trait and  the employment decision may give  rise to\r\n\nan inference of discriminatory animus, see St. Mary's, 113 S. Ct.\r                                                               \r\n\nat 2747, but it is not enough to establish a per  se violation of\r\n\nthe statute (at least when, as now, the justification advanced by\r\n\nthe employer in support of the employment decision is on its face\r\n\nlegitimate and nondiscriminatory).9\r\n\n          To sum up, an employee (pregnant or not) runs a risk of\r\n\nsuffering  the  ordinary  slings  and  arrows  that  suffuse  the\r\n\nworkplace  every day  she goes to  work and  every day  she stays\r\n\naway.  Title  VII is neither a shield against this broad spectrum\r\n\nof employer actions nor a  statutory guaranty of full employment,\r\n\ncome what  may.   Applying the PDA  as the  appellant asks  would\r\n\neliminate   an  employer's  business  necessity  defense     long\r\n\nrecognized  under Title VII    and cripple  industry's ability to\r\n\nmanage workers in  keeping with nondiscriminatory considerations.\r\n\nThat is not the law.  See Bowen v. Valley Camp of Utah, Inc., 639\r                                                                      \r\n\nF. Supp. 1199, 1204 (D.

In the  court's  estimation,  Morse discharged  the\r\n\nappellant for nondiscriminatory reasons.  The record permits that\r\n\nview  of the  facts.   That the  discharge took  place while  the\r\n\nappellant   was  on   maternity   leave  possessed   considerable\r\n\nevidentiary   significance      but  that   circumstance  neither\r\n\ntransformed the  character of the employer's  action nor rendered\r\n\nit per se unlawful under Title VII.

If the  proof,  eyed  from this\r\n\nstandpoint,  permits  a reasonable  factfinder  to  reach only  a\r\n\nconclusion favorable  to the movant,  then the court  must remove\r\n\nthe issue from the jury's consideration.

That  is to say,\r                      \r\n\nunless an  employment  relationship  explicitly  provides  for  a\r\n\ndefinite duration, it is presumed to  be at-will.  See Butler  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nWalker  Power, Inc., 629 A.2d 91, 93 (N.H. 1993) (explaining that\r                             \r\n\nthe at-will presumption \"is a gap filler for determining duration\r\n\nwhen  the parties'  contract of  employment is  silent as  to its\r\n\nexpiration\").   This  is  critically important  when an  employee\r\n\nchallenges her ouster; an employer can give an at-will employee  \r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\neven one who has been a stellar performer   her walking papers at\r\n\nany  time,  for any  reason or  no  reason, unless  a  statute, a\r\n\ncollective bargaining agreement, or  some aspect of public policy\r\n\nproscribes firing the employee on a particular basis.  See Panto,\r                                                                          \r\n\n547 A.2d at 267.\r\n\n          Of course,  an employer and  an employee may  alter the\r\n\nat-will status of the  employment relationship.  See  Butler, 629\r                                                                      \r\n\nA.2d  at  93; Panto,  547  A.2d  at  267.   Such  a  modification\r                             \r\n\nsometimes may  be accomplished  if the  employer makes  a binding\r\n\noffer that the employee can accept by remaining on the  job.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nPanto, 547 A.2d  at 265.

At best, it  involves matters of degree.   In the\r\n\nlast  analysis,  the   standard  is  reasonable   certainty,  not\r\n\nmathematical precision.   See Sawin  v.

By\r\n\ncontinuing  her  employment in  the  wake of  such  promises, her\r\n\nthesis runs, she accepted the offer.   The district court did not\r\n\nbuy  the patchwork, remarking in  its ore tenus  ruling that \"the\r                                                         \r\n\npromises   described   by  the   evidence  are   of  insufficient\r\n\ndefiniteness  to  be  enforceable,  do  not  modify  the  at-will\r\n\nemployment relationship,  [and are such] that  any calculation of\r\n\ndamages or any identification of breach would be impracticable if\r\n\nnot impossible.\"  We agree with the lower court that the terms of\r\n\nthe alleged contract are too indefinite to raise a jury question.\r\n\n          We start by attempting  to decipher the true  nature of\r\n\nthe appellant's claim.   Her lawyers tell us that  the disjointed\r\n\nstatements  made to her (e.g., \"don't worry, we will manage while\r\n\nyou are on maternity leave, your job is secure,\" \"you will assume\r\n\nmore  responsibilities on  your return,\"  you are  \"wanted back\")\r\n\ncreated  a contract to reinstate her  following the completion of\r\n\nher maternity leave.  Yet, the appellant concedes that Bond's and\r\n\nGuimond's statements  did not  alter the durational  component of\r\n\nthe at-will  employment relationship.  A contract to reinstate an\r\n\nat-will employee to  an at-will  position (from  which she  could\r\n\nimmediately be removed without cause) is no contract at all.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\nLight v.

The evidence also fails to establish\r\n\neither the  nature of  the position  Smith was  to assume or  her\r\n\nproposed  rate  of  pay.    These  gaps   seemingly  foreclose  a\r\n\nreasonably certain computation of damages.\r\n\n          Concluding,  as we  do, that  the alleged  contract for\r\n\nreinstatement is  too indefinite  to be actionable  does not  end\r\n\nthis   phase  of  our  inquiry.     In  stark   contrast  to  the\r\n\nreinstatement theory  proffered by her  counsel, the  appellant's\r\n\nown testimony  indicates that she understood  the statements made\r\n\nto  her   as  promises  of  employment   \"indefinitely,\"  and  as\r\n\nconstituting an abiding \"commitment  to a permanent position with\r\n\nF.W. Morse  that would never  end.\"   If, by this,  she means  to\r\n\nsuggest  a  contract  for  lifetime employment,  her  claim  also\r\n\nfounders.\r\n\n          Although tangentially related New  Hampshire precedents\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\nexist, the  state supreme court has not  explicitly addressed the\r\n\ncontours  of   contracts  for   lifetime  employment.     We  are\r\n\nnonetheless confident  that the court would  adopt the prevailing\r\n\nview  of such matters.   See generally Kathios  v.

Under that law, even an at-will employee cannot\r\n\nbe cashiered for a reason that offends public policy because such\r\n\nan  employment decision  \"is  not in  the  best interest  of  the\r\n\neconomic system or the pubic good and constitutes a breach of the\r\n\nemployment contract,\"  Monge v. Beebe  Rubber Co., 316  A.2d 549,\r                                                           \r\n\n551 (N.H. 1974).  The appellant urges that her severance offended\r\n\nthe state's  policy against gender-based discrimination.   In the\r\n\ncourt below,   Judge Stahl ruled that  when a statutory remedy is\r\n\navailable, New  Hampshire courts would not  entertain a complaint\r\n\nthat  an  at-will  employee  had been  wrongfully  discharged  in\r\n\nviolation of  public policy.   Therefore, the  appellant's common\r\n\nlaw   claim  for  wrongful  discharge  failed  because  pregnancy\r\n\ndiscrimination is redressable under Title VII.  See Smith I, slip\r                                                                     \r\n\nop. at 9-10.\r\n\n           In reaching  this conclusion, the district  court drew\r\n\nheavily upon the teachings of Howard v.

The appellant  strives to convince  us that a\r\n\nlater New Hampshire  case, Cloutier v.  Great Atlantic &amp;  Pacific\r                                                                           \r\n\nTea Co.,  436 A.2d 1140  (N.H. 1981), defenestrates  the district\r                 \r\n\ncourt's reading of Howard.  We are not persuaded.\r                                   \r\n\n          In  Howard,  the plaintiff  alleged  that  he had  been\r                              \r\n\ndischarged because  of  age.   The  New Hampshire  Supreme  Court\r\n\nconstrued  its seminal decision in Monge, 316 A.2d 549, \"to apply\r                                                  \r\n\nonly  to a situation where  an employee is  discharged because he\r\n\nperformed an act  that public policy would encourage,  or refused\r\n\n                                31\r\r\n\nto do that which public policy would condemn.\"  Howard, 414  A.2d\r                                                                \r\n\nat  1274.   A  discharge due  to  age fell  outside  this \"narrow\r\n\ncategory\" inasmuch  as  the  \"proper  remedy for  an  action  for\r\n\nunlawful age  discrimination is  provided for  by statute.\"   Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\n(listing state and federal statutory remedies).  In Cloutier, the\r                                                                      \r\n\ncourt synthesized  these cases, holding  that to come  within the\r\n\njudicially created public policy exception a plaintiff \"must show\r\n\nthat the  defendant  was  motivated  by  bad  faith,  malice,  or\r\n\nretaliation in  terminating [her] employment,\" 436  A.2d at 1143,\r\n\nand  must also  \"demonstrate  that [s]he  was discharged  because\r\n\n[s]he performed  an act  that public  policy would  encourage, or\r\n\nrefused to do something that public policy would condemn,\" id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n1144.   Cloutier did not answer, however, the question of whether\r                          \r\n\nsuch a  cause of action lies where, as here, the public policy at\r\n\nstake is codified  in a  statute that itself  provides a  private\r\n\nright of action to remedy transgressions.10\r\n\n          A recently decided  case makes the import of  the state\r\n\nsupreme court's earlier decisions pellucid and speaks directly to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     10In Cloutier,  the defendant  argued that  there must  be a\r                            \r\nstatutory expression of a  public policy, and that  a generalized\r\nassertion of a public policy (loosely based on a federal statute)\r\nis insufficient  as a  matter of  law to  meet the  public policy\r\nprong of a wrongful  discharge claim.  See Cloutier, 436  A.2d at\r                                                             \r\n1144-45.    The  court  disagreed, observing  that  it  had  \"not\r\nrestrict[ed  the] holding  in  Howard to  situations involving  a\r                                               \r\npublic policy enunciated in a statute.  Public policy  exceptions\r\ngiving  rise to wrongful discharge  actions may also  be based on\r\nnon-statutory  policies.\"  Id. at  1144.  This  language means no\r                                        \r\nmore than that a  plaintiff can utilize a statutory  provision to\r\nprove the  existence of a public policy;  it does not address the\r\nmore sophisticated issue  of whether  a plaintiff may  rely on  a\r\nstatute that provides a remedy for its violation.\r\n\n                                32\r\r\n\nthe question that  confronts us here.  In  Wenners v. Great State\r                                                                           \r\n\nBeverages, Inc., 663  A.2d 623 (N.H. 1995),  the plaintiff relied\r                         \r\n\non a section of the Bankruptcy Code to  establish a public policy\r\n\nagainst the termination of his employment.  See id. at  625.  The\r                                                             \r\n\ncourt held that \"[w]hile a plaintiff  may not pursue a common law\r\n\nremedy  where  the  legislature intended  to  replace  it  with a\r\n\nstatutory  cause of  action,\" a  wrongful discharge  action could\r\n\nproceed if  the relevant  statutory provision did  not provide  a\r\n\nprivate  cause  of  action  for its  violation.    Id.  (internal\r                                                                \r\n\ncitations  omitted).  We deem  this holding to  be dispositive of\r\n\nSmith's contention.11\r\n\n          Title VII  not only codifies the  public policy against\r\n\ngender-based  discrimination  (including,  but  not  limited  to,\r\n\npregnancy  discrimination) but  also creates  a private  right of\r\n\naction to remedy  violations of  that policy and  limns a  mature\r\n\nprocedure  for  pursuing  such an  action.    Under Wenners,  the\r                                                                     \r\n\nexistence  of  such a  remedy  precludes  the  appellant, in  the\r\n\ncircumstances of this case, from asserting a common law claim for\r\n\nwrongful  discharge.   It follows that  the district  court acted\r\n\nimpeccably in granting summary judgment on this claim.12\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11To  the   extent  that  either  Kopf   v.

CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We  need go  no further.   On  the factbound  Title VII\r\n\nclaim, this case presents a close question.  In the end, however,\r\n\nwe must uphold the district court's judgment because the standard\r\n\nof review is generous and there  is enough evidence in the record\r\n\nto  support the trier's findings.   On the two common law claims,\r\n\nour task is  appreciably easier; both  claims raise questions  of\r\n\nlaw, not of fact, and  the district court   albeit in  the person\r\n\nof two different district judges   correctly resolved them.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                    Concurring opinion follows  \r                              Concurring opinion follows  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nWhen  the highest court of a state  disposes of an issue of state\r\nlaw contrary to the resolution of the issue theretofore suggested\r\nby  a federal  court,  the  latter ruling  must  give  way.

The  majority applauds  the\r\n\n  district court's  failure to fully analyze  Smith's claims as\r\n\n  \"prudential.\"   I, however, am convinced  that Smith produced\r\n\n  direct evidence of  intentional discrimination  and that  the\r\n\n  district court  was  obligated to  fully analyze  plaintiff's\r\n\n  case under the framework of Price  Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490\r                                                                    \r\n\n  U.S. 228  (1989).   Additionally, I think  that the  majority\r\n\n  mischaracterizes   the   law   relevant  to   the   causation\r\n\n  requirement  under Title VII and Morse's position-elimination\r\n\n  defense.   Its  opinion  could erroneously  be  viewed as  an\r\n\n  invitation to use that defense as a cover  for discrimination\r\n\n  against women who take or plan to take maternity leave. \r\n\n  I.

My first concern\r\n\n  arises  from the  district  court's  abbreviated analysis  of\r\n\n  plaintiff's  claim.

The majority compounds this\r                   \r\n\n  analytical omission  by praising  the district court  for its\r\n\n  \"directness\"   and   for   having   \"largely   bypassed   any\r\n\n  differential    direct    evidence/circumstantial    evidence\r\n\n  tamisage.\"   A  district court's  decision to  circumvent the\r\n\n  analytical  processes  Supreme  Court  and  circuit precedent\r\n\n  require should be criticized, not praised.  \r\n\n            This is particularly true where Title VII cases are\r\n\n  concerned.   The discrimination  that  plaintiffs like  Kathy\r\n\n  Smith face in the workplace is frequently as subtle  as it is\r\n\n  invidious.   It is in recognition of this hard truth that the\r\n\n  Supreme   Court  established  an   analytical  process  which\r\n\n  district courts, in my opinion, are required to follow.  See,\r                                                                        \r\n\n  e.g.,  McDonnell   Douglas,  411  U.S.  at   801  (\"[I]n  the\r                                      \r\n\n  implementation  of [employment]  decisions, it  is abundantly\r\n\n  clear  that Title  VII  tolerates no  .  . .  discrimination,\r\n\n  subtle or  otherwise.\"); see also Price  Waterhouse, 490 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n  at 271.   The Court's jurisprudence stands for  the principle\r\n\n  that  the unlawfulness  of the  employment actions  typically\r\n\n  challenged  in  Title VII  cases  is best  exposed  through a\r\n\n  process of inquiry.  See, e.g., Burdine, 450 U.S.  at 255 n.8\r                                                   \r\n\n  (\"In a Title VII case, the  allocation of burdens and the . .\r\n\n  . prima facie case [requirement] [are] intended progressively\r\n\n                               -37-\r                                          37\r\r\n\n  to sharpen the inquiry  into the elusive factual  question of\r\n\n  intentional  discrimination.\").    Because  I  stand by  that\r\n\n  principle, I would ordinarily suggest a remand in a case such\r\n\n  as this.\r\n\n            I have come to the conclusion, however, that remand\r\n\n  would not be  meaningful in this  case.   This does not  mean\r\n\n  that  I  agree with  the  district court's  finding  that the\r\n\n  evidence produced by Smith  was not compelling.  I  concur in\r\n\n  the  result because I am  bound by Supreme  Court and circuit\r\n\n  precedent.   And in this area, that precedent, unfairly in my\r\n\n  opinion, imposes too  heavy a burden on plaintiffs  trying to\r\n\n  prove the  ultimate issue  in discrimination cases:  that the\r\n\n  employer intentionally discriminated against her on the basis\r\n\n  of a Title  VII-protected trait.   I believe  that Smith  has\r\n\n  produced  enough evidence  to meet  her initial  burden under\r\n\n  Price  Waterhouse or  McDonnell  Douglas, but  agree that  it\r                                                    \r\n\n  would have been plausible for  a factfinder to conclude  that\r\n\n  Morse   proved   its   position-elimination  defense   by   a\r\n\n  preponderance  of the  evidence or,  alternatively,  that the\r\n\n  facts   established  were   insufficient  to   show  pretext.\r\n\n  Although  it did so without adhering to the process Title VII\r\n\n  requires, the  district court  decided the ultimate  issue in\r\n\n  the case and, although I disagree with it, I  cannot say that\r\n\n  decision was clearly erroneous.  \r\n\n                               -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\n  II.

Direct Evidence Under Price Waterhouse\r                                                       \r\n\n            In  light  of  my  concurrence  in  the  majority's\r\n\n  ultimate  holding   on  Smith's  Title   VII  claim,   issues\r\n\n  pertaining to the  nature of the  evidence Smith produced  at\r\n\n  trial are, admittedly, moot.  Nevertheless, I want to explain\r\n\n  my belief that Smith produced direct evidence and  that Price\r                                                                         \r\n\n  Waterhouse controls  this case.   This  is important for  two\r                      \r\n\n  reasons.    First,   the  availability  of  direct   evidence\r\n\n  determines  whether a  case  should be  analyzed under  Price\r                                                                         \r\n\n  Waterhouse or McDonnell Douglas.  Direct evidence renders the\r                                           \r\n\n  McDonnell  Douglas framework inapposite and imposes a heavier\r                              \r\n\n  burden  of proof on the employer.

Phipps, 67 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n  1137, 1141 (4th Cir. 1995).\r\n\n            Second,  the determination of  whether the evidence\r\n\n  produced at trial is direct, though cast in procedural terms,\r\n\n  affects  the substantive  outcome in  Title VII  cases.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\n  Deborah  C.

This observation is of less import in Smith's\r\n\n  case because, at the  time the events giving rise  to Smith's\r\n\n  suit  occurred, the  law provided that  an employer  shown to\r\n\n  have unlawfully discriminated could avoid Title VII liability\r\n\n  by  demonstrating by  a  preponderance of  evidence that  the\r\n\n  adverse employment decision  would have been the same even if\r\n\n                               -39-\r                                          39\r\r\n\n  discrimination  had played no role.

Section 107 of the\r\n\n  Act provides that Title VII is violated whenever an  employer\r\n\n  takes sex  or pregnancy  into account, regardless  of whether\r\n\n  other  considerations  independently   explain  the   adverse\r\n\n  employment decision.

Prevailing mixed-motives plaintiffs, at the\r\n\n  very least,  are now  entitled to declaratory  and injunctive\r\n\n  relief and attorney's fees.  See Kerr-Selgas v. Am.

Thus,\r\n\n  what  constitutes direct  evidence  is a  critical issue  for\r\n\n  Title VII plaintiffs.\r\n\n            The majority makes  repeated references to \"smoking\r\n\n  gun\" evidence.  Using  this term only obscures the  fact that\r\n\n  this  Circuit  has yet  to  clearly  define what  constitutes\r\n\n  direct evidence of gender discrimination.  On prior occasions\r\n\n  we have held  that \"[d]irect evidence  is evidence which,  in\r\n\n  and  of itself, shows  a discriminatory animus.\"   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n  Jackson,  900 F.2d at 467.   But, this  reasoning is circular\r                   \r\n\n  and does  not further  understanding  of the  term.   Justice\r\n\n  O'Connor,  in her  concurring  opinion  in Price  Waterhouse,\r                                                                        \r\n\n  defined  the term  in  the negative,  explaining that  direct\r\n\n  evidence   \"exclude[s]  'stray  remarks  in  the  workplace,'\r\n\n  'statements   by   nondecisionmakers',   or  'statements   by\r\n\n  decisionmakers unrelated to  the decisional process itself.'\"\r\n\n  Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 277 (O'Connor concurring).  \r                            \r\n\n            I contend that the evidence Smith produced at trial\r\n\n  was direct and, therefore,  warranted full application of the\r\n\n  Price Waterhouse  framework.   The evidence shows  that Smith\r                            \r\n\n  was pregnant,  and   requested and received  unpaid maternity\r\n\n  leave.   After being on  leave several weeks,  Smith notified\r\n\n  Morse's general  manager, Guimond, that she  wanted to return\r\n\n                               -41-\r                                          41\r\r\n\n  to  work  on  May 15,  1989,  a  week  earlier than  planned.\r\n\n  Guimond  approved  the  earlier start time  and assured Smith\r\n\n  that her  job was secure.   She also asked Smith  whether she\r\n\n  intended  to have  additional children; Smith  indicated that\r\n\n  she did. \r\n\n            On  May 2,  1989, the  day after  this conversation\r\n\n  occurred,  Guimond also  questioned Vendasi,  Smith's sister,\r\n\n  about Smith's future  childbearing plans.   Smith  confronted\r\n\n  Guimond  about this behavior and the rumor that she would not\r\n\n  be returning to  work because  she had decided  to stay  home\r\n\n  with her child.  Guimond denied any knowledge about the rumor\r\n\n  and reiterated that Smith's job was secure; she repeated this\r\n\n  guarantee two days later.   Despite these assurances, Guimond\r\n\n  terminated Smith on May  11, 1989, one week after  their last\r\n\n  conversation and four days before Smith was slated  to return\r\n\n  to work.   Guimond requested permission  to tell people  that\r\n\n  Smith  failed to return to  work because she  decided to stay\r\n\n  home to care for her child, but Smith refused to give it.  \r\n\n            There  is  precedent holding  that  statements like\r\n\n  those  Guimond made  to Smith  and Vendasi  constitute direct\r\n\n  evidence.   For  example, in  the Eighth  Circuit, statements\r\n\n  made by an employer can be direct evidence of discrimination,\r\n\n  if  made during  a key  decisional process.   In  Beshears v.\r                                                                         \r\n\n  Asbill, 930 F.2d 1348,  1354 (8th Cir. 1991), the  court held\r                  \r\n\n  that  an  employer's oral  statement,  \"older employees  have\r\n\n                               -42-\r                                          42\r\r\n\n  problems adapting  to changed  and new policies,\"  was direct\r\n\n  evidence of age discrimination.  930 F.2d at 1354.

In 1994,  the  Seventh Circuit  held  that post-\r\n\n  discharge   statements  made  by  a  supervisor  were  direct\r\n\n  evidence of age bias, even though they were not reflective of\r\n\n  an  express  intent to  discriminate.

Beverage  Canners, Inc.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n  897  F.2d 1067, 1070 (11th  Cir. 1990), the  court found that\r\n\n  racially biased statements made by a supervisor to workers in\r\n\n  his plant were direct evidence of racial animus and a hostile\r\n\n  environment under Title VII.  \r\n\n            Guimond's statements to both Smith and Vendasi fall\r\n\n  well within the definition  of direct evidence established by\r\n\n  cases such  as Beshears and  Beverage Canners.   Guimond  was\r                                                         \r\n\n  solely  responsible  for Morse's  personnel  decisions.

Finally, the facts show  that the timing\r\n\n  of  the decision  to  terminate Smith  was  suspicious.   Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\n  Troupe v.

Within two  weeks of learning about Smith's  plans to\r\n\n  have more children, Guimond  decided to terminate Smith, even\r\n\n  though  she had  repeatedly assured  Smith  that her  job was\r\n\n  secure.\r\n\n            This evidence of discrimination is direct and clear\r\n\n  even if it does not reach the status of a  smoking gun.  That\r\n\n  some inferences must be drawn from what was said and  done to\r\n\n  reach   this  conclusion  does   not  make  Smith's  evidence\r\n\n  indirect.

It may\r\n\n  not in  all cases, but  it arguably  did in this  case.   The\r\n\n  majority's discussion of causation completely disregards this\r\n\n  possibility.  Its blanket  contention that pregnancy does not\r\n\n  give  plaintiffs  \"total  immunity\"  from  adverse employment\r\n\n  actions  ignores the  extent to  which maternity  leave gives\r\n\n  employers  an   opportunity  to  discharge   women  who  take\r\n\n  maternity  leave or who express  an intention to  have one or\r\n\n  more children.\r\n\n            The evidence arguably shows that the position Smith\r\n\n  held  would  have  been  eliminated even  if  Morse  had  not\r\n\n  considered her  pregnancy or intention to  become pregnant in\r\n\n  the future.    It  does not  necessarily  follow  from  this,\r\n\n  however, that  Smith  would have  been  fired had  Morse  not\r\n\n  considered  her  maternity  leave  or  desire  to  have  more\r\n\n  children.  In their conversations before Smith took maternity\r\n\n  leave,   Bond,  Morse's  president,   and  Guimond  discussed\r\n\n  eliminating the  materials manager  position, but  not Smith.\r\n\n  The record shows both that Bond initially intended to  retain\r\n\n  Smith because  of her excellent  skills and that  he admitted\r\n\n  that Smith would still be employed at Morse had she not taken\r\n\n  maternity leave.\r\n\n                               -47-\r                                          47\r\r\n\n            Had Smith  refused to  disclose or even  lied about\r\n\n  her intention to have more children, she would probably still\r\n\n  have a  job at Morse.   The facts show that  Guimond was very\r\n\n  concerned  about the  disruption Smith's absence  would cause\r\n\n  and suggest that  she would  have taken steps  to avoid  such\r\n\n  disruption in  the future.   The majority  completely ignores\r\n\n  the probability  that Smith's  expressed desire to  have more\r\n\n  children was the motivating factor in her  discharge and that\r\n\n  her temporary absence on maternity leave gave her employer an\r\n\n  opportunity to find  a reason  to discharge her.   I  contend\r\n\n  that the evidence Smith  produced was sufficient to establish\r\n\n  intent and causation.\r\n\n            The two  examples the majority gives  to illustrate\r\n\n  the need  for a causal  connection between pregnancy  and the\r\n\n  adverse employment  action challenged in  disparate treatment\r\n\n  cases  are both  inapposite and  unfair.   Footnote 9  of the\r\n\n  court's opinion analogizes Smith's dismissal during maternity\r\n\n  leave  to an  employee who  is discharged while  on religious\r\n\n  leave  because heroin is discovered in her  desk.  It is true\r\n\n  that  in  both  cases  the  employee's  absence  enabled  the\r\n\n  employer to make  the discovery resulting in  discharge.  But\r\n\n  here the analogy breaks down.  \r\n\n            The  possession of heroin  is illegal; its presence\r\n\n  in the employee's desk was  a fact that could not  be refuted\r\n\n  (although an explanation  might be made).   The employer  did\r\n\n                               -48-\r                                          48\r\r\n\n  not  have to make any determination  as to the quality of the\r\n\n  employee's  work or her capabilities.   She had  to be fired.\r\n\n  In the  case of maternity  leave, however, an  employer would\r\n\n  have  to  make  a  judgment  as  to  whether  eliminating the\r\n\n  position made  good business  sense.  Considerations  such as\r\n\n  the  employee's  prior  performance and  future  childbearing\r\n\n  plans would  be part  of the  employer's position-elimination\r\n\n  decision.   At least in part, that decision would be \"because\r\n\n  of\" pregnancy, present and future.   It could not be made  in\r\n\n  the vacuum the majority's hypothetical presupposes.\r\n\n            Similarly,  the cases the majority cites to support\r\n\n  its  view obscure  the causation  issue and  unfairly compare\r\n\n  Smith  to employees  who are placed  on probation  because of\r\n\n  poor  attitudes or  who are  discharged because  of unexcused\r\n\n  absences.  Cases such as Troupe  v. May Dep't  Stores Co., 20\r                                                                     \r\n\n  F.3d  734 (7th  Cir.  1994), Crnokrak  v.

Crnokrak involved a plaintiff  who was terminated\r                                \r\n\n  after  returning from maternity  leave later  than originally\r\n\n  expected, whereas  Johnson dealt with an  employee who lacked\r                                      \r\n\n  supervisory skills and  who was fired  after being placed  on\r\n\n                               -49-\r                                          49\r\r\n\n  probation because of a poor work attitude.  The one position-\r\n\n  elimination case  the  majority cites,  Pearlstein v.  Staten\r                                                                         \r\n\n  Island  Univ. Hosp.,  886 F.  Supp. 260  (E.D.N.Y. 1995),  is\r                               \r\n\n  similarly  inapposite; it  involved adoption,  not pregnancy,\r\n\n  and  an  employee  who gave  short  notice  of  her need  for\r\n\n  maternity  leave.  And in that case, the evidence showed that\r\n\n  the plaintiff  was accidentally  overpaid, that  her employer\r\n\n  was  experiencing  financial difficulties,  and that  she had\r\n\n  received no assurances about the security of her job.     \r\n\n            These cases  do not directly  address the causation\r\n\n  issues  presented  here.    In contrast  to  Pearlstein,  the\r                                                                   \r\n\n  evidence  in this  case  shows that  Smith received  repeated\r\n\n  assurances about her job, that the raise she received  before\r\n\n  taking  maternity leave  was  intentional,  and that  Smith's\r\n\n  termination was not due  to economic hardship.  Additionally,\r\n\n  the evidence does  not show that Smith  was fired for  a poor\r\n\n  attitude,  that she had ever  been on probation,  or that she\r\n\n  lacked  supervisory skills.    The fact  that Smith  received\r\n\n  regular promotions and  that few  people at  the Morse  plant\r\n\n  exceeded  her level  of  education or  experience belies  any\r\n\n  suggestion  that Smith's  performance and  skills were  below\r\n\n  par.  \r\n\n            Finally,     Smith  received   permission  for  her\r\n\n  maternity leave,  shortened the  duration of that  leave, and\r\n\n  was fired before  she could  return to work,  not before  she\r\n\n                               -50-\r                                          50\r\r\n\n  left.   Smith's maternity leave, thus, did not pose a problem\r\n\n  for  Morse  in  the  same  way  that  the  Troupe  employee's\r                                                             \r\n\n  unexpected illness or the Crnokrak plaintiff's extended leave\r                                              \r\n\n  did  for their employers.  The crux of Morse's defense, after\r\n\n  all,  is  that Smith  was fired  because  her absence  had no\r\n\n  effect whatsoever on Morse's operations. \r\n\n            My point  is simple:   just  as pregnancy does  not\r\n\n  fully  shield  plaintiffs  from  adverse  employment actions,\r\n\n  business judgment  or  necessity does  not  totally  immunize\r\n\n  employers  from  Title  VII's  sanctions.    The   majority's\r\n\n  discussion of causation understates  this important point.  I\r\n\n  believe  that, more  often  than not,  a correlation  between\r\n\n  pregnancy  and  position elimination  during  maternity leave\r\n\n  will exist.   It is naive to think that an employer would not\r\n\n  take an employee's pregnancy  or intention to become pregnant\r\n\n  in  the  future  into  consideration during  the  process  of\r\n\n  determining   whether  the  employee's   position  should  be\r\n\n  eliminated.14\r\n\n  IV.

That Act,  however, does not apply in  pre-1993 cases\r\n  and does  not, moreover, correct  the problems I  perceive in\r\n  the majority  opinion's analysis and  posture towards Smith's\r\n  discrimination claim.  \r\n\n                               -51-\r                                          51\r\r\n\n            The majority upholds  the district court's  finding\r\n\n  that  Morse made  out a  position-elimination defense  on two\r\n\n  grounds: that  Morse reduced its  management-level staff  and\r\n\n  that  Smith's  duties  were  shifted to  employees  who  were\r\n\n  already on the Morse payroll.  Though I concur in the holding\r\n\n  that  Morse  arguably proved  the  facts  necessary to  rebut\r\n\n  Smith's gender discrimination claim, I think the scope of the\r\n\n  position-elimination defense is considerably more narrow than\r\n\n  the majority's  interpretation of the facts suggests.  That a\r\n\n  company is  able to manage in  the absence of one  of its key\r\n\n  employees  will not  always be  proof of  a nondiscriminatory\r\n\n  purpose, contrary to what the  court's opinion implies.  Were\r\n\n  that so,  every woman who took maternity leave would do so at\r\n\n  risk of losing her job.\r\n\n            Moreover,  the conclusion  that  Morse reduced  its\r                                                                    \r\n\n  management staff is not supported by the evidence.  Morse did\r\n\n  not, as the court's exposition of the  facts suggests, reduce\r\n\n  its  management  team  from seven  to  three.    The majority\r\n\n  reached this conclusion by  eliminating Bond and Guimond from\r\n\n  its final count, even though they each donned  one of the two\r\n\n  hats formerly  worn by  Darryl Robinson, Damar's  founder and\r\n\n  chief officer.  It also erroneously included Smith in Damar's\r\n\n  original  management team,  even though  she did  not have  a\r\n\n  management title  at that time.  And it failed to include the\r\n\n  two  assistant manager  positions  in its  final count,  even\r\n\n                               -52-\r                                          52\r\r\n\n  though  the  individuals   holding  those   slots  did   have\r\n\n  management  titles.   If  the individuals  excluded from  the\r\n\n  majority's  calculations  are  added,  the  size  of  Morse's\r\n\n  management  team was  the same at  the end  as it  was in the\r\n\n  beginning -- seven.15\r\n\n            The facts demonstrate that Morse mainly reorganized\r                                                                         \r\n\n  its  management   team.     It  consolidated   positions  and\r\n\n  eliminated titles,  but  did not  decrease  the size  of  its\r\n\n  management.   Because  it would  have been plausible  for the\r\n\n  district court  to interpret this  reorganization as position\r\n\n  elimination,  I  concur in  the court's  holding.   I  do not\r\n\n  agree,  however,  that  reorganizations  of  the  sort  Morse\r\n\n  carried  out will  be enough to  rebut claims  of intentional\r\n\n  discrimination in every  case.  For me,  whether the district\r\n\n  court was clearly erroneous in its findings on this issue was\r\n\n  a very close call.\r\n\n            The court's  holding that Smith  was not  replaced,\r\n\n  that  her  duties  were  merely transferred  to  other  Morse\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  15.  Post-acquisition    of   Damar,    Morse's   upper-level\r\n  management team  included the  following seven people:   Bond\r\n  (president); Guimond (general manager);  Paradis (machining);\r\n  Shevenell  (sheet  metal);  Bickford   (engineering);  Seeger\r\n  (sales);  and Smith (materials).   I do not  include Lane and\r\n  Hickman  in  this  number  because  they  were  fired  almost\r\n  immediately after Damar's acquisition, partially due to their\r\n  poor performance.  After Smith was fired, Morse's upper-level\r\n  management  team  still  included  seven  individuals:   Bond\r\n  (president); Guimond (general manager); Paradis (operations);\r\n  Shevenell (manufacturing); Seeger (sales); Lapanne (assistant\r\n  manager); and Hoffman (assistant manager).\r\n\n                               -53-\r                                          53\r\r\n\n  employees,  is based on our  holding in LeBlanc  v. Great Am.\r                                                                         \r\n\n  Ins.

LeBlanc  holds  that  a position-elimination\r                                    \r\n\n  defense is not  defeated by  the claim that  an employee  was\r\n\n  only \"replaced\"  because  \"another employee [was] assigned to\r\n\n  perform the  plaintiff's duties in addition  to other duties,\r\n\n  or  [because]  the  work   [was]  redistributed  among  other\r\n\n  existing employees already performing  related work.\"  6 F.3d\r\n\n  at 846; see  also Barnes  v. GenCorp., Inc.,  896 F.2d  1457,\r                                                       \r\n\n  1465 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 878 (1990).  \r                                         \r\n\n            To  the extent  that Morse's defense  comports with\r\n\n  Leblanc at all,  it does so on the basis  of the first prong,\r                   \r\n\n  not the second.   In analogizing Morse's first reorganization\r\n\n  to the  reorganization which  occurred after  Smith's firing,\r\n\n  the  majority  opinion gives  the  impression  that LeBlanc's\r                                                                       \r\n\n  second   prong,  the  \"related   work\"  requirement,  can  be\r\n\n  satisfied  by demonstrating  that  a plaintiff's  duties were\r\n\n  simply transferred to someone working in the same company.  I\r\n\n  disagree.   I contend that LeBlanc's related-work requirement\r                                              \r\n\n  cannot  be met unless the employer proves that it shifted the\r\n\n  plaintiff's duties  to employees who were  already performing\r\n\n  some of the plaintiff's duties or, at least, duties that were\r\n\n  very similar.  This did not occur in this case.  \r\n\n            In the first reorganization, Smith was promoted  to\r\n\n  materials manager and  asked to officially assume some of the\r\n\n                               -54-\r                                          54\r\r\n\n  duties  she  had  already  been  performing  because  of  the\r\n\n  inadequacies of other  managers.  Smith at that  time assumed\r\n\n  duties which,  in my opinion, constituted  related work under\r\n\n  LeBlanc.   In  contrast,  the second  reorganization did  not\r                   \r\n\n  shift Smith's  responsibilities to  managers who had  already\r\n\n  been performing  her  job.    After Smith  was  fired,  those\r\n\n  managers  took  on  what  were essentially  new  duties;  the\r\n\n  majority's own contention that Paradis and Shevenell were far\r\n\n  more experienced than Smith and responsible for the technical\r\n\n  aspects  of  Morse's  business bears  this  out.   That  they\r\n\n  performed those duties for some period before Smith was fired\r\n\n  was  only   because  Smith  was  on  maternity  leave.    The\r\n\n  nonpregnancy-based    explanation   for    their   additional\r\n\n  responsibilities did not kick in until after Smith's firing.\r\n\n            If Title VII's protections  against pregnancy-based\r\n\n  discrimination are to  have any force, the relevant period of\r\n\n  inquiry for determining whether the duties formerly performed\r\n\n  by  a plaintiff  were assumed  by someone  already performing\r\n\n  related work under LeBlanc  should not be during  a maternity\r                                      \r\n\n  leave.   The relevant period  of inquiry must  be before that\r\n\n  leave  began.   Using the  time period when  the woman  is on\r\n\n  maternity leave creates a perverse  incentive to discriminate\r\n\n  against  pregnant women by firing  them when they  are not at\r\n\n  their  jobs and  when  it will  almost  always be  true  that\r\n\n  someone  else is performing their  duties.  In  this case, if\r\n\n                               -55-\r                                          55\r\r\n\n  Smith had not become pregnant and  taken maternity leave, she\r\n\n  would still be a valued Morse employee.\r\n\n  V.  Conclusion\r            V.  Conclusion\r\n\n            William James once said that an idea's \"validity is\r\n\n  the process  of its valid-ation.\"   Accordingly, I  concur in\r\n\n  the  outcome  reached in  this  case,  but  not  the  process\r\n\n  employed,  because  I disagree  with  the  view of  pregnancy\r\n\n  discrimination  cases taken by the majority.  I think it only\r\n\n  plausible that gender was not the  motivation for the adverse\r\n\n  employment action  taken against  Smith, not \"true.\"   And  I\r\n\n  agree  only that  position elimination  can be  a defense  in\r\n\n  Title VII cases, not that it will be a defense in every case.\r\n\n  For  me, the  process employed  in reaching  a result,  which\r\n\n  includes the hypotheticals drawn and examples given, matters.\r\n\n                               -56-\r                                          56\r\r\n",

P 43,884, 64 USLW 2563</p>\n    <p class=\"parties\">Kathy SMITH, Plaintiff, Appellant,<br>v.<br>F.W. MORSE &amp; CO., INC., Defendant, Appellee.</p>\n    <p class=\"docket\">No. 95-1556.</p>\n    <p class=\"court\">United States Court of Appeals,<br>First Circuit.</p>\n    <p class=\"date\">Heard Nov. 6, 1995.<br>Decided Feb. 12, 1996.</p>\n    <div class=\"prelims\">\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 23, 1988, defendant-appellee F.W. Morse &amp; Co., Inc.  (Morse), a firm owned by Chris Bond, acquired Damar's business and assets.   Damar then had fewer than forty employees, including seven managers reporting directly to Robinson:  Michael Hickman (production control);  Robert Lane (shipping);  Ronald Paradis (production/machining);  Marc Shevenell (production/sheet metal);  Gary Bickford (engineering);  Michael Seeger (sales);  and Smith.   Though not titled, Smith testified that she was considered to be a de facto manager who, largely because of Hickman's inadequacies, performed many of the duties of the production control manager.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bond promptly concluded that Damar had too many chiefs and too few Indians.   Within days of the closing, he fired Hickman.   Then, in concert with Maryann Guimond, the new general manager (who had authority to hire, fire, and discipline personnel), he interviewed a number of employees, including Smith.   In the aftermath of this review, the company cashiered Lane.   To fill the void created by the two executive-level departures, Morse promoted Smith to the newly created position of materials manager, consolidating responsibilities for scheduling, production control, inventory control, purchasing, shipping, and receiving that had previously been spread among three managers.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All told, Morse's initial reorganization efforts substituted Guimond for Robinson and pared second-echelon management from seven to five.   In addition to Guimond, the reconfigured management team comprised Paradis (machining);  Shevenell (sheet metal);  Bickford (engineering);  Seeger (sales);  and Smith (materials).   In recognition of Smith's increased responsibilities, Morse twice hiked her pay (once in January and again in March), thus increasing her weekly stipend by roughly twenty-five percent.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At about the time of the takeover, Smith informed Bond that she had become pregnant and would need a maternity leave.   Morse, a tiny company, had no formal maternity leave policy.   Bond nonetheless honored Smith's request and assured her that her position was \"secure.\"   In preparation for her leave, Smith held several meetings with Guimond, Shevenell, and Paradis.   The company temporarily distributed her managerial duties among other supervisors and arranged for a newly-hired secretary, Kelly Gilday, to perform her clerical functions.   Along the way, Guimond informed Smith that either Paradis or Shevenell likely would be discharged, and told her that she would be promoted again upon her return from maternity leave.   Guimond also indicated that, in all probability, Bickford would be demoted, and Smith would be asked to assume a portion of his duties.   While these changes presumably would warrant increased remuneration, Guimond did not mention an amount.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 7, 1989, Smith began her maternity leave, planning to return to work in approximately six weeks.   She gave birth two weeks later.   Meanwhile, Guimond, expecting the \"sky to fall,\" held regular \"reality check\" meetings with Shevenell and Paradis.   To her surprise, the plant functioned very well.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Guimond reported the good news to Bond.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith visited the plant on May 1 and informed Guimond that she wished to return to work one week earlier than originally anticipated.   Guimond inquired about whether Smith desired more children, and Smith replied affirmatively.   The following day, Guimond queried Karen Vendasi, Smith's sister and co-worker, about Smith's plans to have a larger family.   Vendasi relayed this conversation to Smith and told her of nascent rumors to the effect that she might not return to work.   Smith contacted Guimond and demanded an explanation.   Guimond denied any knowledge of the rumors, dismissed them as idle buzznacking, and again assured Smith that her job was secure.   Guimond repeated these assurances during a chance meeting on May 4.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days later, Guimond concluded that the materials manager's position was superfluous and decided to eliminate it.   She told Smith of her decision on May 11.   During this telephone conversation, Guimond asked Smith if she preferred people to be told that she had decided to stay at home with her infant child rather than that she had been discharged.   Smith rejected the suggestion.   Nevertheless, a Morse employee repeated this canard to several customers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following Smith's severance, Guimond gave most of her duties to Paradis in his new capacity as operations manager.   Shevenell assumed the role of manufacturing manager (in charge of both machining and sheet metal work).   Guimond also promoted two lower-ranking employees, Peter Lapanne and Brian Hoffman, to assistant manager positions (though evidence adduced at trial demonstrated that Lapanne had been an assistant manager as far back as 1984, and that neither man assumed any new responsibilities or received any salary increase in connection with his new title).   Gilday continued to perform the clerical functions associated with Smith's former position.   When the second round of the reorganization wound down, the plant had three second-echelon managers--Paradis (operations);  Shevenell (manufacturing);  and Seeger (sales)--in lieu of the original seven.</p>\n      <p>B. Procedural History.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith sued Morse in a New Hampshire state court alleging, inter alia, wrongful discharge based on gender discrimination, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and breach of contract.   Morse removed the case to federal district court on the ground that Smith's claim \"arose under\" Title VII, thus prompting federal question jurisdiction.   See 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1331, 1343(a)(3), 1441, 1446;  see also 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367 (conferring ancillary jurisdiction over appended nonfederal claims).   Smith thereafter filed an amended complaint that made her Title VII claim explicit.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in the proceedings, Morse moved for partial summary judgment.   The district court (Stahl, J.) granted the motion on the common law wrongful discharge and emotional distress claims.  See Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., No. 90-361-S, slip op. at 12 (D.N.H. Sept. 26, 1991) (unpublished) (Smith I ).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several years later, the parties simultaneously tried the Title VII claim to the bench (McAuliffe, J.) and the breach of contract claim to a jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  At the close of the plaintiff's case, the district court entered judgment as a matter of law in the defendant's favor on the breach of contract claim and disbanded the jury.   The Title VII case proceeded before the district judge.   Morse asserted that it scrapped the materials manager's position and laid off the appellant as part of an overarching strategy to streamline a top-heavy managerial structure, and that even if Smith had not been on maternity leave she would have been flattened by the downsizing steamroller.   The district court agreed and entered judgment accordingly.   See Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., 901 F.Supp. 40, 45 (D.N.H.1995) (Smith II ).   This appeal ensued.</p>\n      <p>II. THE TITLE VII CLAIM</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crown jewel of the appellant's asseverational array is her contention that the district court erred in finding that Morse did not discriminate against her on the basis of her sex.   Our appraisal of this contention is in three parts.</p>\n      <p>A. Standard of Review.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a bench trial, the court of appeals reviews the trier's factual determinations for clear error, see Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.1990);  Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), but affords plenary review to the trier's formulation of applicable legal rules, see Johnson v. Watts Regulator Co., 63 F.3d 1129, 1132 (1st Cir.1995).   The jurisprudence of clear error constrains us from deciding factual issues anew.   See, e.g., Jackson v. Harvard Univ., 900 F.2d 464, 466 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 848, 111 S.Ct. 137, 112 L.Ed.2d 104 (1990);  Keyes v. Secretary of the Navy, 853 F.2d 1016, 1019 (1st Cir.1988).   Indeed, we may not disturb the district court's record-rooted findings of fact unless on the whole of the evidence we reach the irresistible conclusion that a mistake has been made.   See Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at 152;  RCI Northeast Servs.  Div. v. Boston Edison Co., 822 F.2d 199, 203 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This deferential standard extends not only to factual findings simpliciter but also to inferences drawn from the underlying facts.   See Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at 152.   Similarly, findings regarding an actor's motivation fall within the shelter of Rule 52(a), and, therefore, if the trial court's reading of the record on such an issue is plausible, appellate review is at an end.   See Foster v. Dalton, 71 F.3d 52, 56-57 (1st Cir.1995);  Anthony v. Sundlun, 952 F.2d 603, 606 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n      <p>B. The Jurisprudence of Title VII.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title VII provides, inter alia, that it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discharge an individual because of her sex.   See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(a)(1).   After the Supreme Court held that this phraseology did not proscribe discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, see General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125, 145-46, 97 S.Ct. 401, 412-13, 50 L.Ed.2d 343 (1976), Congress augmented Title VII by enacting the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA), Pub.L. 95-555, &#167; 1, 92 Stat. 2076, 2076 (1978) (codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e(k)).   The PDA made clear that:</p>\n      <p>The terms \"because of sex\" or \"on the basis of sex\" include, but are not limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions;  and women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs, as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e(k).   Thus, at the time Smith and Morse parted company, Title VII's ban on gender discrimination encompassed pregnancy-based discrimination.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like other Title VII plaintiffs, an employee claiming discrimination on the basis of pregnancy may proceed under either a disparate treatment or a disparate impact theory.   See generally Furnco Constr.  Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 575, 579-80, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 2948-49, 2950-51, 57 L.Ed.2d 957 (1978) (explaining the dichotomy).   Here, the appellant alleged disparate treatment.   Consequently, she had the burden of proving that the defendant purposefully terminated her employment because of her pregnancy.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cases predating the Civil Rights Act of 1991, see supra note 3, the framework for proving intentional discrimination varies depending on the availability of direct evidence. See Fields v. Clark Univ., 966 F.2d 49, 51-52 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1052, 113 S.Ct. 976, 122 L.Ed.2d 130 (1993);  Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at 153.   Absent the evidentiary equivalent of a \"smoking gun,\" the plaintiff must attempt to prove her case by resort to a burden-shifting framework.   See Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254-56, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1094-95, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981);  McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).   Under this framework, a plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of pregnancy discrimination by showing that (1) she is pregnant (or has indicated an intention to become pregnant), (2) her job performance has been satisfactory, but (3) the employer nonetheless dismissed her from her position (or took some other adverse employment action against her) while (4) continuing to have her duties performed by a comparably qualified person.   See, e.g., Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at 153;  Lipsett v. University of P.R., 864 F.2d 881, 899 (1st Cir.1988).   Establishing the prima facie case raises a rebuttable presumption that discrimination sparked the adverse employment action, see Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at 153, and imposes upon the employer a burden to put forward a legitimate, nondiscriminatory motive for the action.   See Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254-55, 101 S.Ct. at 1094-95;  Lipsett, 864 F.2d at 899.   If the defendant clears this modest hurdle, the presumption of discrimination vaporizes, see Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 823 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 985, 112 S.Ct. 2965, 119 L.Ed.2d 586 (1992),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and the plaintiff (who retains the ultimate burden of persuasion on the issue of discriminatory motive throughout) must then prove that the employer's proffered justification is a pretext for discrimination, see St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2749, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993);  Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 823-24.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the relatively rare occasions when a smoking gun is discernible--that is, when a plaintiff produces direct evidence that the protected characteristic was a motivating factor in the employment action--the McDonnell Douglas framework is inapposite.   See Fields, 966 F.2d at 52.   In those cases, direct evidence of discriminatory motive--say, an admission by the employer that it explicitly took actual or anticipated pregnancy into account in reaching an employment decision--serves to shift the burden of persuasion from employee to employer.   The latter must then affirmatively prove that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken the protected characteristic into account.   See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 258, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 1794-95, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989) (plurality op.);  id. at 265-67, 109 S.Ct. at 1798-1800 (O'Connor, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The seeming neatness of this dichotomy is illusory in certain respects, for evidence rarely comes in tidy, geometrically precise packages.   In many cases, the line between McDonnell Douglas, on one hand, and Price Waterhouse, on the other hand, is blurred.   In those situations, classification depends on both the quantity and quality of the proof that a court deems sufficient to constitute direct evidence of discriminatory animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Discretion is sometimes the better part of valor, and courts often wisely decide to sidestep difficult theoretical questions if answers to them are not essential to the proper resolution of a given case.   We have here a good example of such a prudential approach.   The trial court largely bypassed any differential direct evidence/circumstantial evidence tamisage, preferring to go directly to a finding that, on the totality of the evidence presented, Morse had proven that gender discrimination did not trigger the firing.   See Smith II, 901 F.Supp. at 44-45.   This approach negates any need for us to pursue the question of an analytic framework to a definite conclusion.   While we agree with our concurring colleague that the decisional process is important, there comes a point at which slavish insistence upon process for its own sake serves only to exalt the trappings of justice over its substance.   Here, the district court's finding on causation, if sustainable, resolves the Title VII claim whether the appellant's prima facie case arises under the McDonnell Douglas or Price Waterhouse paradigm.   And as we illustrate below, see infra Part III(C), that finding passes muster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>C. The Merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with the district court's approach, Morse must be assumed to have had the burden of proving that it would have taken the same action--the elimination of the materials manager's position--whether or not the appellant became pregnant, took a maternity leave, or planned to bear more children.   The court found that Morse carried the devoir of persuasion on this pivotal issue.   It concluded that Morse's decision was \"motivated by business judgment and represented an effort to economize by placing the most qualified personnel in the fewest number of managerial positions possible, and was not based on plaintiff's gender, pregnancy, or her expressed desire to have more children.\"  Smith II, 901 F. Supp. at 44.   The court also concluded \"that even if Guimond is assumed to have considered impermissible gender-based factors, the same decision to eliminate plaintiff's position would still have been made at the same time\" for reasons of business necessity.  Id.  The crux of our inquiry is whether these findings are clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is little doubt that an employer, consistent with its business judgment, may eliminate positions during the course of a downsizing without violating Title VII even though those positions are held by members of protected groups (pregnant women included).   See, e.g., LeBlanc v. Great Am.  Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 844-45 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1398, 128 L.Ed.2d 72 (1994);  Goldman v. First Nat'l Bank, 985 F.2d 1113, 1118-19 (1st Cir.1993);  Montana v. First Fed.  Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 869 F.2d 100, 105, 107 (2d Cir.1989);  Dister v. Continental Group, Inc., 859 F.2d 1108, 1115 (2d Cir.1988);  Pearlstein v. Staten Island Univ.  Hosp., 886 F.Supp. 260, 268-69 (E.D.N.Y.1995).   This is merely a reflection of a central theme that permeates the relevant jurisprudence:  insofar as Title VII is concerned, an employer can hire or fire one employee instead of another for any reason, fair or unfair, provided that the employer's choice is not driven by race, gender, pregnancy, or some other protected characteristic.   See Foster, 71 F.3d at 56;  Keyes, 853 F.2d at 1026;  see also Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1341 (1st Cir.1988) (elucidating similar proposition in ADEA case).   The flip side of the coin, however, is that an employer who selectively cleans house cannot hide behind convenient euphemisms such as \"downsizing\" or \"streamlining.\"   Whether or not trimming the fat from a company's organizational chart is a prudent practice in a particular business environment, the employer's decision to eliminate specific positions must not be tainted by a discriminatory animus.   See Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1118 n. 4;  Maresco v. Evans Chemetics, 964 F.2d 106, 111 (2d Cir.1992);  Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 825;  Pearlstein, 886 F.Supp. at 268-69.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we believe that the evidence adequately supports the trial court's findings.   When Morse took over, Damar had an inordinately high ratio of managers to workers and the managers' responsibilities overlapped.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Both Bond and Guimond testified that from the very start they believed that Damar's sprawling organizational structure defied rhyme or reason.   Accordingly, they set out to compress some of the sprawl.   The district court credited their intention, noting that the witnesses' actions matched their stated objective.   More to the point, Guimond testified that she terminated the appellant \"because I had a position that I no longer felt needed to be filled.\"   Bond testified in the same vein, indicating that he, too, had become convinced that Smith's position was expendable.   The court accepted this evidence, concluding that the materials manager's position would have been eliminated within the same time frame whether or not Smith had taken a maternity leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, this determination, while not inevitable, is supportable.   In the first place, the record strongly suggests that, in fact, the position was expendable.   In the second place, any other choice would have entailed a loss of engineering expertise that Damar could ill afford.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In the third place, the court's view is bolstered by the reception that the appellant originally received from the new ownership.   Bond and Guimond apprised her of the planned downsizing and assigned her significant new responsibilities when other managers were dismissed.   They also promoted her and increased her compensation.   These actions, undertaken with full knowledge that the appellant was pregnant and would be taking a six-week maternity leave, are inconsistent with a bias against pregnant employees.   In the fourth place, the district judge, sitting as the trier of fact, had the right to credit Bond's testimony that the \"maternity leave never played a role in itself\" because the same decision \"would have been made in a very close time frame,\" and Guimond's testimony to like effect.   In a bench trial, such credibility judgments are the judge's prerogative.   See Anthony, 952 F.2d at 606.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the record could support a less innocuous conclusion.   The chronal proximity of Guimond's questions anent Smith's plans to have more children and her dismissal, Guimond's ill-advised suggestion that customers and employees be told that Smith decided to stay at home to care for her daughter, and Smith's termination while on maternity leave are troubling--so much so that we, if free to write a palimpsest, might have characterized the impetus behind the appellant's ouster differently.   But whether the trial court could have drawn an inference of discriminatory intent is not the test.   See Foster, 71 F.3d at 55;  Keyes, 853 F.2d at 1027.   As long as a contrary inference is also supportable--and that is the situation here--then it is for the trial court, not the court of appeals, to call the tune.   After all, \"when there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\"  Johnson, 63 F.3d at 1138 (citing Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to evade the force of this principle, the appellant hauls two further arguments from her bag.   First, she asseverates that Morse did not in fact eliminate her position, and that the district court's contrary finding, see Smith II, 901 F.Supp. at 43, is itself clearly erroneous.   This asseveration leads down a blind alley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When an employer defends an employment discrimination case on the ground of position elimination, the position may not, like a Dali painting, fade from one image to another only for the first image to reemerge at the blink of an eye.   See Gallo v. Prudential Residential Servs., Ltd. Partnership, 22 F.3d 1219, 1226-28 (2d Cir.1994);  LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 846;  Barnes v. GenCorp.  Inc., 896 F.2d 1457, 1465 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 878, 111 S.Ct. 211, 112 L.Ed.2d 171 (1990).   Yet, a position elimination defense is not defeated merely because another employee, already on the payroll, is designated to carry out some or all of the fired employee's duties in addition to his own, or because those duties are otherwise reallocated within the existing work force.   See LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 846;  Barnes, 896 F.2d at 1465.   The elimination of a position signifies the employer's belief that it can get by with one less helper;  it does not necessarily convey a belief that the work the employee had been doing was superfluous and need not be performed at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the undisputed evidence before the district court indicates that after Guimond dismissed Smith, the position that Smith had occupied--materials manager--fell into desuetude.   There is no basis in the record for a suggestion that Lapanne or Hoffman assumed any of the appellant's former duties;  those duties, which Paradis, Shevenell, and Gilday had performed during Smith's leave, continued to be performed by them (or, at least, by Paradis and Gilday).   In short, the second round of the reorganization (which cost Smith her job) bore a striking resemblance to the first round (which gave Smith her promotion to materials manager).   Given these facts, the district judge's determination that Morse eliminated the appellant's position is unimpugnable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant next endeavors to surmount the sharp escarpment of the clearly erroneous rule by casting a hook at the legal standard applied by the trial court.   This is a theoretically sound way to climb the mountain, see, e.g., Reliance Steel Prods.  Co. v. National Fire Ins. Co., 880 F.2d 575, 577 (1st Cir.1989) (explaining that appellate courts review questions of law de novo, even after a bench trial), but in this case the hook does not hold.   The appellant's thesis is as follows.   She says that Title VII prohibits an employer from dismissing an employee while she is on maternity leave even if the employer, in the process of rationalizing its work force, discovers that her position is redundant and eliminates it for that reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Refined to bare essence, this thesis suggests that, since Morse would not have discovered the redundancy at that time (if ever) but for the fact that Smith took a maternity leave, the leave brought about the firing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  And the appellant attempts to drive this point home by citing Bond's testimony that \"because\" Smith was out on maternity leave, Morse was able to discover that her position was expendable--testimony which the appellant optimistically equates with an admission that Morse dismissed her \"because\" of her pregnancy.   With respect, we believe that this argument, which seeks to apply a black-letter legal principle in a totally mechanical fashion, plays mischievously on the mendacity of language by substituting sound for sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled under Title VII that an employer may not discharge an employee based on the categorical fact of her pregnancy.   See Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U.S. 669, 684, 103 S.Ct. 2622, 2631-32, 77 L.Ed.2d 89 (1983);  Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at 153.   By the same token, since a short-term inability to work is bound up with the very nature of pregnancy and childbirth, that disability is a pregnancy-related condition within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e(k), and Title VII thus prohibits an employer from dismissing an employee in retaliation for taking an authorized maternity leave.   Nevertheless, under the PDA, pregnancy does not confer total immunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  An employer may discharge an employee while she is pregnant if it does so for legitimate reasons unrelated to her pregnancy.   See, e.g., Troupe v. May Dept. Stores Co., 20 F.3d 734, 738 (7th Cir.1994);  Pearlstein, 886 F.Supp. at 268-69;  see also Lipsett, 864 F.2d at 899 (holding that an employer may dismiss an employee who is in a protected class for a nondiscriminatory reason);  Johnson v. Allyn &amp; Bacon, Inc., 731 F.2d 64, 70 (1st Cir.1984) (similar).   It follows, then, that an employer may discharge an employee while she is on a pregnancy-induced leave so long as it does so for legitimate reasons unrelated to her gravidity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Harmonizing these principles leads to the following conclusions.   Title VII mandates that an employer must put an employee's pregnancy (including her departure on maternity leave) to one side in making its employment decisions--but the statute does not command that an employer bury its head in the sand and struthiously refrain from implementing business judgments simply because they affect a parturient employee.   See Troupe, 20 F.3d at 738 (holding that the PDA \"requires the employer to ignore an employee's pregnancy, but ... not her absence from work\");  Crnokrak v. Evangelical Health Systems Corp., 819 F.Supp. 737, 743 (N.D.Ill.1993) (stating that \"the PDA does not force employers to pretend that absent employees are present whenever their absences are caused by pregnancy\").   At bottom, Title VII requires a causal nexus between the employer's state of mind and the protected trait (here, pregnancy).   The mere coincidence between that trait and the employment decision may give rise to an inference of discriminatory animus, see St. Mary's, 509 U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2747, but it is not enough to establish a per se violation of the statute (at least when, as now, the justification advanced by the employer in support of the employment decision is on its face legitimate and nondiscriminatory).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, an employee (pregnant or not) runs a risk of suffering the ordinary slings and arrows that suffuse the workplace every day she goes to work and every day she stays away.   Title VII is neither a shield against this broad spectrum of employer actions nor a statutory guaranty of full employment, come what may.   Applying the PDA as the appellant asks would eliminate an employer's business necessity defense--long recognized under Title VII--and cripple industry's ability to manage workers in keeping with nondiscriminatory considerations.   That is not the law.   See Bowen v. Valley Camp of Utah, Inc., 639 F.Supp. 1199, 1204 (D.Utah 1986) (explaining that Title VII, as amended by the PDA, does not \"preclude an employer from articulating legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating a woman while she was on maternity leave\");  see generally Blackie v. Maine, 75 F.3d 716, 723 (1st Cir.1996) (suggesting, in retaliation case, that \"[a] contrary rule would mummify the status quo\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court found the requisite nexus lacking between the employer's mindset and the employee's gravidity.   In the court's estimation, Morse discharged the appellant for nondiscriminatory reasons.   The record permits that view of the facts.   That the discharge took place while the appellant was on maternity leave possessed considerable evidentiary significance--but that circumstance neither transformed the character of the employer's action nor rendered it per se unlawful under Title VII.   The district court therefore did not apply an erroneous legal standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the appellant's partially tried breach of contract claim.   At the close of her case, the trial court took this claim from the jury and directed a verdict in Morse's favor.   The appellant assigns error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>A. Standard of Review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court of appeals reviews the grant of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo, applying the same legal principles that inform the trial court's ruling.   See Rolon-Alvarado v. Municipality of San Juan, 1 F.3d 74, 77 (1st Cir.1993).   Accordingly, we \"examine the evidence and the inferences reasonably extractable therefrom in the light most hospitable to the nonmovant.\"  Fashion House, Inc. v. K mart Corp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1088 (1st Cir.1989).   If the proof, eyed from this standpoint, permits a reasonable factfinder to reach only a conclusion favorable to the movant, then the court must remove the issue from the jury's consideration.   See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this approach does not allow the court to \"consider the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the evidence,\" Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir.1987), neither does it pave the way for every case, no matter how sketchy, to reach the jury.   Thus, \"a mere scintilla of evidence is not enough to forestall a directed verdict, especially on a claim or issue as to which the burden of proof belongs to the objecting party.\"  Fashion House, 892 F.2d at 1088.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>B.

Under that law, the at-will status of an employment relationship is \"one of prima facie construction.\"  Panto v. Moore Business Forms, Inc., 130 N.H. 730, 547 A.2d 260, 267 (1988).   That is to say, unless an employment relationship explicitly provides for a definite duration, it is presumed to be at-will.   See Butler v. Walker Power, Inc., 137 N.H. 432, 629 A.2d 91, 93 (1993) (explaining that the at-will presumption \"is a gap filler for determining duration when the parties' contract of employment is silent as to its expiration\").   This is critically important when an employee challenges her ouster;  an employer can give an at-will employee--even one who has been a stellar performer--her walking papers at any time, for any reason or no reason, unless a statute, a collective bargaining agreement, or some aspect of public policy proscribes firing the employee on a particular basis.   See Panto, 547 A.2d at 267.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, an employer and an employee may alter the at-will status of the employment relationship.   See Butler, 629 A.2d at 93;  Panto, 547 A.2d at 267.   Such a modification sometimes may be accomplished if the employer makes a binding offer that the employee can accept by remaining on the job.   See Panto, 547 A.2d at 265.   Standard contract formation principles govern the creation and construction of such contracts.   See id. at 264.   Thus, the \"offer must be so definite as to its material terms or require such definite terms in the acceptance that the promises and performances to be rendered by each party are reasonably certain.\"  Chasan v. Village Dist. of Eastman, 128 N.H. 807, 523 A.2d 16, 21 (1986) (quoting Restatement of Contracts &#167; 32 (1932)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Definiteness, like beauty, is frequently in the eye of the beholder.   At best, it involves matters of degree.   In the last analysis, the standard is reasonable certainty, not mathematical precision.   See Sawin v. Carr, 114 N.H. 462, 323 A.2d 924, 926 (1974).   The provisions of a contract need only be \"sufficiently certain to allow claims of breach to be resolved readily, and to enable a reasonably certain computation of damages.\"  Panto, 547 A.2d at 264 (internal citations omitted);  accord Phillips v. Verax Corp., 138 N.H. 240, 637 A.2d 906, 910 (1994);  Sawin, 323 A.2d at 926.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the appellant takes bits and pieces of various conversations that she had with Guimond and Bond, pastes them together, and argues that a rational jury, mulling the ensuing patchwork, could conclude that Morse offered to reinstate and promote her following her maternity leave.   By continuing her employment in the wake of such promises, her thesis runs, she accepted the offer.   The district court did not buy the patchwork, remarking in its ore tenus ruling that \"the promises described by the evidence are of insufficient definiteness to be enforceable, do not modify the at-will employment relationship, [and are such] that any calculation of damages or any identification of breach would be impracticable if not impossible.\"   We agree with the lower court that the terms of the alleged contract are too indefinite to raise a jury question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by attempting to decipher the true nature of the appellant's claim.   Her lawyers tell us that the disjointed statements made to her (e.g., \"don't worry, we will manage while you are on maternity leave, your job is secure,\" \"you will assume more responsibilities on your return,\" you are \"wanted back\") created a contract to reinstate her following the completion of her maternity leave.   Yet, the appellant concedes that Bond's and Guimond's statements did not alter the durational component of the at-will employment relationship.   A contract to reinstate an at-will employee to an at-will position (from which she could immediately be removed without cause) is no contract at all.   See Light v. Centel Cellular Co., 883 S.W.2d 642, 645 n. 5 (Tex.1994) (holding that, as long as the at-will character of the employment relationship remains unchanged, any \"promise made by either employer or employee that depends on an additional period of employment is illusory because it is conditioned upon something that is exclusively within the control of the promisor\");  E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts &#167;&#167; 2.13, 2.14 (2d ed. 1990) (explaining that promises to maintain an at-will relationship are illusory);  cf. Butler, 629 A.2d at 94 (terming an analytically equivalent argument \"a thin reed\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is this the only shortcoming in the supposed contract for reinstatement.   The evidence also fails to establish either the nature of the position Smith was to assume or her proposed rate of pay.   These gaps seemingly foreclose a reasonably certain computation of damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concluding, as we do, that the alleged contract for reinstatement is too indefinite to be actionable does not end this phase of our inquiry.   In stark contrast to the reinstatement theory proffered by her counsel, the appellant's own testimony indicates that she understood the statements made to her as promises of employment \"indefinitely,\" and as constituting an abiding \"commitment to a permanent position with F.W. Morse that would never end.\"   If, by this, she means to suggest a contract for lifetime employment, her claim also founders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although tangentially related New Hampshire precedents exist, the state supreme court has not explicitly addressed the contours of contracts for lifetime employment.   We are nonetheless confident that the court would adopt the prevailing view of such matters.   See generally Kathios v. General Motors Corp., 862 F.2d 944, 949 (1st Cir.1988) (explaining that a federal court, called upon to determine state law in the absence of direct in-state precedent, may look, inter alia, to cases in other jurisdictions);  Moores v. Greenberg, 834 F.2d 1105, 1107 (1st Cir.1987) (similar).   That view regards such contracts as out of the ordinary, and insists that an offer for lifetime employment must be expressed in clear and unequivocal terms to be enforceable.   See, e.g., Williamson v. Sharvest Mgmt. Co., 187 W.Va. 30, 415 S.E.2d 271, 274 (1992);  Rowe v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., 437 Mich. 627, 473 N.W.2d 268, 273 (1991);  Vance v. Huff, 568 So.2d 745, 749 (Ala.1990);  Shebar v. Sanyo Bus.  Sys. Corp., 111 N.J. 276, 544 A.2d 377, 381-82 (1988);  Degen v. Investors Diversified Servs., Inc., 260 Minn. 424, 110 N.W.2d 863, 866 (1961).   Measured by this yardstick, the representations made by Morse do not stand sufficiently tall to confer lifetime employment.   See, e.g., Williamson, 415 S.E.2d at 275-76 (finding employer's statement that it would \"take care of\" employee insufficiently definite to alter at-will employment);  Skagerberg v. Blandin Paper Co., 197 Minn. 291, 266 N.W. 872, 874 (1936) (finding that the terms \"permanent employment,\" \"life employment,\" and \"as long as the employee chooses\" established only an at-will contract);  Aberman v. Malden Mills Indus., Inc., 414 N.W.2d 769, 771-72 (Minn.Ct.App.1987) (concluding that the statement \"we are offering you security\" only indicated an at-will employment relationship).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

We have explored the nooks and crannies of this rule in a compendium of cases, see, e.g. McCarthy v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 56 F.3d 313, 314-15 (1st Cir.1995);  National Amusements, Inc. v.

Thus, a Rule 56 motion may end the case unless the party opposing it can identify a genuine issue as to a material fact.   In this regard, \"genuine\" means that the evidence on the point is such that a reasonable jury, drawing favorable inferences, could resolve the fact in the manner urged by the nonmoving party.   See One Parcel, 960 F.2d at 204.   By like token, \"material\" means that a contested fact has the potential to alter the outcome of the suit under the governing law if the dispute over it is resolved favorably to the nonmovant.

Under that law, even an at-will employee cannot be cashiered for a reason that offends public policy because such an employment decision \"is not in the best interest of the economic system or the public good and constitutes a breach of the employment contract,\" Monge v. Beebe Rubber Co., 114 N.H. 130, 316 A.2d 549, 551 (1974).   The appellant urges that her severance offended the state's policy against gender-based discrimination.   In the court below, Judge Stahl ruled that when a statutory remedy is available, New Hampshire courts would not entertain a complaint that an at-will employee had been wrongfully discharged in violation of public policy.   Therefore, the appellant's common law claim for wrongful discharge failed because pregnancy discrimination is redressable under Title VII.   See Smith I, slip op. at 9-10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching this conclusion, the district court drew heavily upon the teachings of Howard v. Dorr Woolen Co., 120 N.H. 295, 414 A.2d 1273 (1980).   The appellant strives to convince us that a later New Hampshire case, Cloutier v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., 121 N.H. 915, 436 A.2d 1140 (1981), defenestrates the district court's reading of Howard.   We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Howard, the plaintiff alleged that he had been discharged because of age.   The New Hampshire Supreme Court construed its seminal decision in Monge, 316 A.2d 549, \"to apply only to a situation where an employee is discharged because he performed an act that public policy would encourage, or refused to do that which public policy would condemn.\"  Howard, 414 A.2d at 1274.   A discharge due to age fell outside this \"narrow category\" inasmuch as the \"proper remedy for an action for unlawful age discrimination is provided for by statute.\"  Id. (listing state and federal statutory remedies).   In Cloutier, the court synthesized these cases, holding that to come within the judicially created public policy exception a plaintiff \"must show that the defendant was motivated by bad faith, malice, or retaliation in terminating [her] employment,\" 436 A.2d at 1143, and must also \"demonstrate that [s]he was discharged because [s]he performed an act that public policy would encourage, or refused to do something that public policy would condemn,\" id. at 1144.  Cloutier did not answer, however, the question of whether such a cause of action lies where, as here, the public policy at stake is codified in a statute that itself provides a private right of action to remedy transgressions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A recently decided case makes the import of the state supreme court's earlier decisions pellucid and speaks directly to the question that confronts us here.   In Wenners v. Great State Beverages, Inc., 140 N.H. 100, 663 A.2d 623 (1995), the plaintiff relied on a section of the Bankruptcy Code to establish a public policy against the termination of his employment.   See id. at 625.   The court held that \"[w]hile a plaintiff may not pursue a common law remedy where the legislature intended to replace it with a statutory cause of action,\" a wrongful discharge action could proceed if the relevant statutory provision did not provide a private cause of action for its violation.  Id. (internal citations omitted).   We deem this holding to be dispositive of Smith's contention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title VII not only codifies the public policy against gender-based discrimination (including, but not limited to, pregnancy discrimination) but also creates a private right of action to remedy violations of that policy and limns a mature procedure for pursuing such an action.   Under Wenners, the existence of such a remedy precludes the appellant, in the circumstances of this case, from asserting a common law claim for wrongful discharge.   It follows that the district court acted impeccably in granting summary judgment on this claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.   On the factbound Title VII claim, this case presents a close question.   In the end, however, we must uphold the district court's judgment because the standard of review is generous and there is enough evidence in the record to support the trier's findings.   On the two common law claims, our task is appreciably easier;  both claims raise questions of law, not of fact, and the district court--albeit in the person of two different district judges--correctly resolved them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I am compelled by the deference due a district court's findings of fact to concur in the final result, I write separately because I am troubled by the analysis used in deciding the Title VII claim.   The majority applauds the district court's failure to fully analyze Smith's claims as \"prudential.\"   I, however, am convinced that Smith produced direct evidence of intentional discrimination and that the district court was obligated to fully analyze plaintiff's case under the framework of Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989).   Additionally, I think that the majority mischaracterizes the law relevant to the causation requirement under Title VII and Morse's position-elimination defense.   Its opinion could erroneously be viewed as an invitation to use that defense as a cover for discrimination against women who take or plan to take maternity leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. The District Court's Analytical Process</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basic facts are undisputed.   My first concern arises from the district court's abbreviated analysis of plaintiff's claim.   The Supreme Court has established two analytical frameworks that courts reviewing Title VII claims must follow.   Where the evidence produced at trial is \"direct,\" the Price Waterhouse framework applies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  See Fields v. Clark Univ., 966 F.2d 49, 51-52 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1052, 113 S.Ct. 976, 122 L.Ed.2d 130 (1993);  Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.1990);  Jackson v. Harvard Univ., 900 F.2d 464, 467 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 848, 111 S.Ct. 137, 112 L.Ed.2d 104 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the evidence of discrimination is indirect or circumstantial, the burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), governs.   See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973);  Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981);  St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993).   These basic rules have been followed, as they must, by this Circuit.   See, e.g., Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at 152;  Jackson, 900 F.2d at 467;  Chamberlin v. 101 Realty, 915 F.2d 777, 782 n. 7.  (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet, the district court found that gender discrimination played no part in the decision to terminate the plaintiff's employment without determining whether there was direct evidence under Price Waterhouse or even mentioning McDonnell Douglas.   See Jackson, 900 F.2d at 467 (holding that a finding of direct evidence renders the McDonnell Douglas framework inapplicable).   The majority compounds this analytical omission by praising the district court for its \"directness\" and for having \"largely bypassed any differential direct evidence/circumstantial evidence tamisage.\"   A district court's decision to circumvent the analytical processes Supreme Court and circuit precedent require should be criticized, not praised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is particularly true where Title VII cases are concerned.   The discrimination that plaintiffs like Kathy Smith face in the workplace is frequently as subtle as it is invidious.   It is in recognition of this hard truth that the Supreme Court established an analytical process which district courts, in my opinion, are required to follow.   See, e.g., McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 801, 93 S.Ct. at 1823-24 (\"[I]n the implementation of [employment] decisions, it is abundantly clear that Title VII tolerates no ... discrimination, subtle or otherwise.\");   see also Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 271, 109 S.Ct. at 1802.   The Court's jurisprudence stands for the principle that the unlawfulness of the employment actions typically challenged in Title VII cases is best exposed through a process of inquiry.   See, e.g., Burdine, 450 U.S. at 255 n. 8, 101 S.Ct. at 1094 n. 8 (\"In a Title VII case, the allocation of burdens and the ... prima facie case [requirement] [are] intended progressively to sharpen the inquiry into the elusive factual question of intentional discrimination.\").   Because I stand by that principle, I would ordinarily suggest a remand in a case such as this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have come to the conclusion, however, that remand would not be meaningful in this case.   This does not mean that I agree with the district court's finding that the evidence produced by Smith was not compelling.   I concur in the result because I am bound by Supreme Court and circuit precedent.   And in this area, that precedent, unfairly in my opinion, imposes too heavy a burden on plaintiffs trying to prove the ultimate issue in discrimination cases:  that the employer intentionally discriminated against her on the basis of a Title VII-protected trait.   I believe that Smith has produced enough evidence to meet her initial burden under Price Waterhouse or McDonnell Douglas, but agree that it would have been plausible for a factfinder to conclude that Morse proved its position-elimination defense by a preponderance of the evidence or, alternatively, that the facts established were insufficient to show pretext.   Although it did so without adhering to the process Title VII requires, the district court decided the ultimate issue in the case and, although I disagree with it, I cannot say that decision was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Direct Evidence Under Price Waterhouse</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of my concurrence in the majority's ultimate holding on Smith's Title VII claim, issues pertaining to the nature of the evidence Smith produced at trial are, admittedly, moot.   Nevertheless, I want to explain my belief that Smith produced direct evidence and that Price Waterhouse controls this case.   This is important for two reasons.   First, the availability of direct evidence determines whether a case should be analyzed under Price Waterhouse or McDonnell Douglas.   Direct evidence renders the McDonnell Douglas framework inapposite and imposes a heavier burden of proof on the employer.  Fuller v. Phipps, 67 F.3d 1137, 1141 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the determination of whether the evidence produced at trial is direct, though cast in procedural terms, affects the substantive outcome in Title VII cases.   See Deborah C. Malamud, The Last Minuet:  Disparate Treatment After Hicks, 93 Mich.L.Rev. 2229, 2229 (1995) (\"Title VII jurisprudence cloaks substance in the 'curious garb' of procedure.\").   This observation is of less import in Smith's case because, at the time the events giving rise to Smith's suit occurred, the law provided that an employer shown to have unlawfully discriminated could avoid Title VII liability by demonstrating by a preponderance of evidence that the adverse employment decision would have been the same even if discrimination had played no role.  Lam v. Univ. of Hawai'i, 40 F.3d 1551, 1564-65 (9th Cir.1994).   In other words, direct evidence of discrimination, without more, was not enough to impose liability on Morse.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under today's applicable law, however, a plaintiff producing direct evidence of discrimination under Price Waterhouse may have a Title VII remedy.  Id. at 1565 n. 24.   The Civil Rights Act of 1991 \"modified the Price Waterhouse scheme\" and made \"mixed-motives treatment more favorable to plaintiffs.\"  Fuller, 67 F.3d at 1142;  see Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub.L. 102-166, &#167; 107, 105 Stat. 1071, 1073 (1991) (codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2).   Section 107 of the Act provides that Title VII is violated whenever an employer takes sex or pregnancy into account, regardless of whether other considerations independently explain the adverse employment decision.   Id.;  see 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(m) (\"[A]n unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice.\").   Prevailing mixed-motives plaintiffs, at the very least, are now entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief and attorney's fees.   See Kerr-Selgas v. Am.  Airlines, 69 F.3d 1205, 1210 (1st Cir.1995) (citing 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B)) (where an employer in a mixed-motives case proves that it would have made the same decision, the prevailing plaintiff is entitled to attorney's fees, and declaratory and injunctive relief, but not damages or reinstatement).   Thus, what constitutes direct evidence is a critical issue for Title VII plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority makes repeated references to \"smoking gun\" evidence.   Using this term only obscures the fact that this Circuit has yet to clearly define what constitutes direct evidence of gender discrimination.   On prior occasions we have held that \"[d]irect evidence is evidence which, in and of itself, shows a discriminatory animus.\"   See, e.g., Jackson, 900 F.2d at 467.   But, this reasoning is circular and does not further understanding of the term.   Justice O'Connor, in her concurring opinion in Price Waterhouse, defined the term in the negative, explaining that direct evidence \"exclude[s] 'stray remarks in the workplace,' 'statements by nondecisionmakers', or 'statements by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself.' \"  Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 277, 109 S.Ct. at 1804-05 (O'Connor concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I contend that the evidence Smith produced at trial was direct and, therefore, warranted full application of the Price Waterhouse framework.   The evidence shows that Smith was pregnant, and requested and received unpaid maternity leave.   After being on leave several weeks, Smith notified Morse's general manager, Guimond, that she wanted to return to work on May 15, 1989, a week earlier than planned.   Guimond approved the earlier start time and assured Smith that her job was secure.   She also asked Smith whether she intended to have additional children;  Smith indicated that she did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 2, 1989, the day after this conversation occurred, Guimond also questioned Vendasi, Smith's sister, about Smith's future childbearing plans.   Smith confronted Guimond about this behavior and the rumor that she would not be returning to work because she had decided to stay home with her child.   Guimond denied any knowledge about the rumor and reiterated that Smith's job was secure;  she repeated this guarantee two days later.   Despite these assurances, Guimond terminated Smith on May 11, 1989, one week after their last conversation and four days before Smith was slated to return to work.   Guimond requested permission to tell people that Smith failed to return to work because she decided to stay home to care for her child, but Smith refused to give it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is precedent holding that statements like those Guimond made to Smith and Vendasi constitute direct evidence.   For example, in the Eighth Circuit, statements made by an employer can be direct evidence of discrimination, if made during a key decisional process.   In Beshears v. Asbill, 930 F.2d 1348, 1354 (8th Cir.1991), the court held that an employer's oral statement, \"older employees have problems adapting to changed and new policies,\" was direct evidence of age discrimination.  930 F.2d at 1354.   Two years later, the court expanded its Beshears holding to include written statements.  Radabaugh v. Zip Feed Mills, Inc., 997 F.2d 444, 449-50 (8th Cir.1993), held that written statements included in corporate planning documents were also direct evidence of discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other circuits have included statements made outside of the decisional process in the definition of direct evidence.   In 1994, the Seventh Circuit held that post-discharge statements made by a supervisor were direct evidence of age bias, even though they were not reflective of an express intent to discriminate.   See Robinson v. PPG Indus., Inc., 23 F.3d 1159, 1165 (7th Cir.1994).   Similarly, the Eleventh Circuit has held that statements made by an employer to third parties are direct evidence of discriminatory animus.   In EEOC v. Beverage Canners, Inc., 897 F.2d 1067, 1070 (11th Cir.1990), the court found that racially biased statements made by a supervisor to workers in his plant were direct evidence of racial animus and a hostile environment under Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guimond's statements to both Smith and Vendasi fall well within the definition of direct evidence established by cases such as Beshears and Beverage Canners.   Guimond was solely responsible for Morse's personnel decisions.   Her questions about Smith's childbearing plans were neither stray nor random and evinced a concern about future pregnancy.   Additionally, Guimond began asking questions about Smith's childbearing plans during what she admits was a key decisional period.   Finally, the facts show that the timing of the decision to terminate Smith was suspicious.   Cf. Troupe v. May Dep't Stores, 20 F.3d 734, 736 (7th Cir.1994);  Josey v. Hollingsworth Corp., 996 F.2d 632, 639 (3d Cir.1993).   Within two weeks of learning about Smith's plans to have more children, Guimond decided to terminate Smith, even though she had repeatedly assured Smith that her job was secure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence of discrimination is direct and clear even if it does not reach the status of a smoking gun.   That some inferences must be drawn from what was said and done to reach this conclusion does not make Smith's evidence indirect.   As the Seventh Circuit recognized in its 1991 decision, Visser v. Packer Eng'g Assoc., Inc., 924 F.2d 655, 659 (7th Cir.1991), \"all knowledge is inferential.\"   Because judges are not mind-readers and cannot reach into the mind of a Title VII defendant, a certain amount of inference-drawing is necessary in any case, whether the evidence is direct or indirect.   The ultimate issue in disparate treatment cases--whether the employer intended to discriminate--cannot be established by purely direct evidence.   See Charles A. Sullivan, Accounting For Price Waterhouse:  Proving Disparate Treatment Under Title VII, 56 Brook.L.Rev. 1107, 1138 (1991) (\" '[D]irect evidence' of intent cannot exist, at least in the sense of evidence which, if believed, would establish the ultimate issue of intent to discriminate.\");  Tyler v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 958 F.2d 1176, 1183-84 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 826, 113 S.Ct. 82, 121 L.Ed.2d 46 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than adhering to the colorful but meaningless requirement of a smoking gun, I think we should adopt a definition of direct evidence in Title VII cases which satisfies the minimum negative requirements Justice O'Connor set out in Price Waterhouse:  \"exclude[s] 'stray remarks in the workplace,' 'statements by nondecisionmakers', or 'statements by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself.' \"  Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 277, 109 S.Ct. at 1804-05 (O'Connor concurring).   In accord with the Civil Rights Act of 1991, this definition preserves the mixed-motives case as a viable option in Title VII suits.   Cf. Michael A. Zubrensky, Despite The Smoke, There Is No Gun:  Direct Evidence Requirements In Mixed-Motives Employment Law After Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 46 Stan.L.Rev. 959, 969 (1994).   It lowers the high hurdle of \"smoking gun\" evidence to reasonable limits so that plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases can receive all the protections Title VII was intended to give.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if my definition of Price Waterhouse direct evidence is rejected, however, it is irrefutable that Smith made out a prima facie case of discrimination under McDonnell Douglas:  that after being directly so asked, she expressed an intention to become pregnant in the future;  that her performance at work was more than satisfactory;  that she was terminated after repeated assurances that her job was \"secure;\"  and that her duties continued to be performed by comparably qualified individuals.   See Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at 153;  Lipsett v. Univ. of P.R., 864 F.2d 881, 899 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith's reiteration of these facts on appeal complied with Supreme Court and circuit precedent.   Smith proved that she was fired even though she was an excellent manager and that her duties continued to be performed by other employees.   In my view, this is all McDonnell Douglas' prima facie case burden requires.   See, e.g., Byrd v. Ronayne, 61 F.3d 1026, 1031 (1st Cir.1995) (\"[T]he required prima facie showing is not especially burdensome.\")  (citing Woodman v. Haemonetics Corp., 51 F.3d 1087, 1091 (1st Cir.1995)).   The district court should have shifted to the McDonnell Douglas framework before finding Smith's evidence deficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Causation Under Title VII</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing the question of causation in disparate treatment cases, the majority stresses that a \"coincidence\" between pregnancy leave and an employment decision does not prove intentional discrimination.   It may not in all cases, but it arguably did in this case.   The majority's discussion of causation completely disregards this possibility.   Its blanket contention that pregnancy does not give plaintiffs \"total immunity\" from adverse employment actions ignores the extent to which maternity leave gives employers an opportunity to discharge women who take maternity leave or who express an intention to have one or more children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence arguably shows that the position Smith held would have been eliminated even if Morse had not considered her pregnancy or intention to become pregnant in the future.   It does not necessarily follow from this, however, that Smith would have been fired had Morse not considered her maternity leave or desire to have more children.   In their conversations before Smith took maternity leave, Bond, Morse's president, and Guimond discussed eliminating the materials manager position, but not Smith.   The record shows both that Bond initially intended to retain Smith because of her excellent skills and that he admitted that Smith would still be employed at Morse had she not taken maternity leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had Smith refused to disclose or even lied about her intention to have more children, she would probably still have a job at Morse.   The facts show that Guimond was very concerned about the disruption Smith's absence would cause and suggest that she would have taken steps to avoid such disruption in the future.   The majority completely ignores the probability that Smith's expressed desire to have more children was the motivating factor in her discharge and that her temporary absence on maternity leave gave her employer an opportunity to find a reason to discharge her.   I contend that the evidence Smith produced was sufficient to establish intent and causation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two examples the majority gives to illustrate the need for a causal connection between pregnancy and the adverse employment action challenged in disparate treatment cases are both inapposite and unfair.   Footnote 9 of the court's opinion analogizes Smith's dismissal during maternity leave to an employee who is discharged while on religious leave because heroin is discovered in her desk.   It is true that in both cases the employee's absence enabled the employer to make the discovery resulting in discharge.   But here the analogy breaks down.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The possession of heroin is illegal;  its presence in the employee's desk was a fact that could not be refuted (although an explanation might be made).   The employer did not have to make any determination as to the quality of the employee's work or her capabilities.   She had to be fired.   In the case of maternity leave, however, an employer would have to make a judgment as to whether eliminating the position made good business sense.   Considerations such as the employee's prior performance and future childbearing plans would be part of the employer's position-elimination decision.   At least in part, that decision would be \"because of\" pregnancy, present and future.   It could not be made in the vacuum the majority's hypothetical presupposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the cases the majority cites to support its view obscure the causation issue and unfairly compare Smith to employees who are placed on probation because of poor attitudes or who are discharged because of unexcused absences.   Cases such as Troupe v. May Dep't Stores Co., 20 F.3d 734 (7th Cir.1994), Crnokrak v. Evangelical Health Systems Corp., 819 F.Supp. 737 (N.D.Ill.1993), and Johnson v. Allyn &amp; Bacon, Inc., 731 F.2d 64 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1018, 105 S.Ct. 433, 83 L.Ed.2d 359 (1984), involved discharge, not position elimination.   In Troupe, the employee's pre-maternity leave dismissal was motivated by her tardiness and frequent absences.  Crnokrak involved a plaintiff who was terminated after returning from maternity leave later than originally expected, whereas Johnson dealt with an employee who lacked supervisory skills and who was fired after being placed on probation because of a poor work attitude.   The one position-elimination case the majority cites, Pearlstein v. Staten Island Univ.  Hosp., 886 F.Supp. 260 (E.D.N.Y.1995), is similarly inapposite;  it involved adoption, not pregnancy, and an employee who gave short notice of her need for maternity leave.   And in that case, the evidence showed that the plaintiff was accidentally overpaid, that her employer was experiencing financial difficulties, and that she had received no assurances about the security of her job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These cases do not directly address the causation issues presented here.   In contrast to Pearlstein, the evidence in this case shows that Smith received repeated assurances about her job, that the raise she received before taking maternity leave was intentional, and that Smith's termination was not due to economic hardship.   Additionally, the evidence does not show that Smith was fired for a poor attitude, that she had ever been on probation, or that she lacked supervisory skills.   The fact that Smith received regular promotions and that few people at the Morse plant exceeded her level of education or experience belies any suggestion that Smith's performance and skills were below par.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Smith received permission for her maternity leave, shortened the duration of that leave, and was fired before she could return to work, not before she left.   Smith's maternity leave, thus, did not pose a problem for Morse in the same way that the Troupe employee's unexpected illness or the Crnokrak plaintiff's extended leave did for their employers.   The crux of Morse's defense, after all, is that Smith was fired because her absence had no effect whatsoever on Morse's operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My point is simple:  just as pregnancy does not fully shield plaintiffs from adverse employment actions, business judgment or necessity does not totally immunize employers from Title VII's sanctions.   The majority's discussion of causation understates this important point.   I believe that, more often than not, a correlation between pregnancy and position elimination during maternity leave will exist.   It is naive to think that an employer would not take an employee's pregnancy or intention to become pregnant in the future into consideration during the process of determining whether the employee's position should be eliminated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. The Position-Elimination Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority upholds the district court's finding that Morse made out a position-elimination defense on two grounds:  that Morse reduced its management-level staff and that Smith's duties were shifted to employees who were already on the Morse payroll.   Though I concur in the holding that Morse arguably proved the facts necessary to rebut Smith's gender discrimination claim, I think the scope of the position-elimination defense is considerably more narrow than the majority's interpretation of the facts suggests.   That a company is able to manage in the absence of one of its key employees will not always be proof of a nondiscriminatory purpose, contrary to what the court's opinion implies.   Were that so, every woman who took maternity leave would do so at risk of losing her job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the conclusion that Morse reduced its management staff is not supported by the evidence.   Morse did not, as the court's exposition of the facts suggests, reduce its management team from seven to three.   The majority reached this conclusion by eliminating Bond and Guimond from its final count, even though they each donned one of the two hats formerly worn by Darryl Robinson, Damar's founder and chief officer.   It also erroneously included Smith in Damar's original management team, even though she did not have a management title at that time.   And it failed to include the two assistant manager positions in its final count, even though the individuals holding those slots did have management titles.   If the individuals excluded from the majority's calculations are added, the size of Morse's management team was the same at the end as it was in the beginning--seven.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts demonstrate that Morse mainly reorganized its management team.   It consolidated positions and eliminated titles, but did not decrease the size of its management.   Because it would have been plausible for the district court to interpret this reorganization as position elimination, I concur in the court's holding.   I do not agree, however, that reorganizations of the sort Morse carried out will be enough to rebut claims of intentional discrimination in every case.   For me, whether the district court was clearly erroneous in its findings on this issue was a very close call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's holding that Smith was not replaced, that her duties were merely transferred to other Morse employees, is based on our holding in LeBlanc v. Great Am.  Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1398, 128 L.Ed.2d 72 (1994).  LeBlanc holds that a position-elimination defense is not defeated by the claim that an employee was only \"replaced\" because \"another employee [was] assigned to perform the plaintiff's duties in addition to other duties, or [because] the work [was] redistributed among other existing employees already performing related work.\"  6 F.3d at 846;  see also Barnes v. GenCorp., Inc., 896 F.2d 1457, 1465 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 878, 111 S.Ct. 211, 112 L.Ed.2d 171 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that Morse's defense comports with LeBlanc at all, it does so on the basis of the first prong, not the second.   In analogizing Morse's first reorganization to the reorganization which occurred after Smith's firing, the majority opinion gives the impression that LeBlanc 's second prong, the \"related work\" requirement, can be satisfied by demonstrating that a plaintiff's duties were simply transferred to someone working in the same company.   I disagree.   I contend that LeBlanc 's related-work requirement cannot be met unless the employer proves that it shifted the plaintiff's duties to employees who were already performing some of the plaintiff's duties or, at least, duties that were very similar.   This did not occur in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first reorganization, Smith was promoted to materials manager and asked to officially assume some of the duties she had already been performing because of the inadequacies of other managers.   Smith at that time assumed duties which, in my opinion, constituted related work under LeBlanc.   In contrast, the second reorganization did not shift Smith's responsibilities to managers who had already been performing her job.   After Smith was fired, those managers took on what were essentially new duties;  the majority's own contention that Paradis and Shevenell were far more experienced than Smith and responsible for the technical aspects of Morse's business bears this out.   That they performed those duties for some period before Smith was fired was only because Smith was on maternity leave.   The nonpregnancy-based explanation for their additional responsibilities did not kick in until after Smith's firing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Title VII's protections against pregnancy-based discrimination are to have any force, the relevant period of inquiry for determining whether the duties formerly performed by a plaintiff were assumed by someone already performing related work under LeBlanc should not be during a maternity leave.   The relevant period of inquiry must be before that leave began.   Using the time period when the woman is on maternity leave creates a perverse incentive to discriminate against pregnant women by firing them when they are not at their jobs and when it will almost always be true that someone else is performing their duties.   In this case, if Smith had not become pregnant and taken maternity leave, she would still be a valued Morse employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">William James once said that an idea's \"validity is the process of its valid-ation.\"   Accordingly, I concur in the outcome reached in this case, but not the process employed, because I disagree with the view of pregnancy discrimination cases taken by the majority.   I think it only plausible that gender was not the motivation for the adverse employment action taken against Smith, not \"true.\"   And I agree only that position elimination can be a defense in Title VII cases, not that it will be a defense in every case.   For me, the process employed in reaching a result, which includes the hypotheticals drawn and examples given, matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> During this same time frame, the company eliminated the engineering manager's position.

MORSE &amp; CO., INC., Defendant, Appellee.</p>\n    <p class=\"docket\">No. 95-1556.</p>\n    <p class=\"court\">United States Court of Appeals,<br>First Circuit.</p>\n    <p class=\"date\">Heard Nov. 6, 1995.<br>Decided Feb. 12, 1996.</p>\n    <div class=\"prelims\">\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 23, 1988, defendant-appellee F.W. Morse &amp; Co., Inc.  (Morse), a firm owned by Chris Bond, acquired Damar's business and assets.   Damar then had fewer than forty employees, including seven managers reporting directly to Robinson:  Michael Hickman (production control);  Robert Lane (shipping);  Ronald Paradis (production/machining);  Marc Shevenell (production/sheet metal);  Gary Bickford (engineering);  Michael Seeger (sales);  and Smith.   Though not titled, Smith testified that she was considered to be a de facto manager who, largely because of Hickman's inadequacies, performed many of the duties of the production control manager.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bond promptly concluded that Damar had too many chiefs and too few Indians.   Within days of the closing, he fired Hickman.   Then, in concert with Maryann Guimond, the new general manager (who had authority to hire, fire, and discipline personnel), he interviewed a number of employees, including Smith.   In the aftermath of this review, the company cashiered Lane.   To fill the void created by the two executive-level departures, Morse promoted Smith to the newly created position of materials manager, consolidating responsibilities for scheduling, production control, inventory control, purchasing, shipping, and receiving that had previously been spread among three managers.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All told, Morse's initial reorganization efforts substituted Guimond for Robinson and pared second-echelon management from seven to five.   In addition to Guimond, the reconfigured management team comprised Paradis (machining);  Shevenell (sheet metal);  Bickford (engineering);  Seeger (sales);  and Smith (materials).   In recognition of Smith's increased responsibilities, Morse twice hiked her pay (once in January and again in March), thus increasing her weekly stipend by roughly twenty-five percent.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At about the time of the takeover, Smith informed Bond that she had become pregnant and would need a maternity leave.   Morse, a tiny company, had no formal maternity leave policy.   Bond nonetheless honored Smith's request and assured her that her position was \"secure.\"   In preparation for her leave, Smith held several meetings with Guimond, Shevenell, and Paradis.   The company temporarily distributed her managerial duties among other supervisors and arranged for a newly-hired secretary, Kelly Gilday, to perform her clerical functions.   Along the way, Guimond informed Smith that either Paradis or Shevenell likely would be discharged, and told her that she would be promoted again upon her return from maternity leave.   Guimond also indicated that, in all probability, Bickford would be demoted, and Smith would be asked to assume a portion of his duties.   While these changes presumably would warrant increased remuneration, Guimond did not mention an amount.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 7, 1989, Smith began her maternity leave, planning to return to work in approximately six weeks.   She gave birth two weeks later.   Meanwhile, Guimond, expecting the \"sky to fall,\" held regular \"reality check\" meetings with Shevenell and Paradis.   To her surprise, the plant functioned very well.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Guimond reported the good news to Bond.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith visited the plant on May 1 and informed Guimond that she wished to return to work one week earlier than originally anticipated.   Guimond inquired about whether Smith desired more children, and Smith replied affirmatively.   The following day, Guimond queried Karen Vendasi, Smith's sister and co-worker, about Smith's plans to have a larger family.   Vendasi relayed this conversation to Smith and told her of nascent rumors to the effect that she might not return to work.   Smith contacted Guimond and demanded an explanation.   Guimond denied any knowledge of the rumors, dismissed them as idle buzznacking, and again assured Smith that her job was secure.   Guimond repeated these assurances during a chance meeting on May 4.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days later, Guimond concluded that the materials manager's position was superfluous and decided to eliminate it.   She told Smith of her decision on May 11.   During this telephone conversation, Guimond asked Smith if she preferred people to be told that she had decided to stay at home with her infant child rather than that she had been discharged.   Smith rejected the suggestion.   Nevertheless, a Morse employee repeated this canard to several customers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following Smith's severance, Guimond gave most of her duties to Paradis in his new capacity as operations manager.   Shevenell assumed the role of manufacturing manager (in charge of both machining and sheet metal work).   Guimond also promoted two lower-ranking employees, Peter Lapanne and Brian Hoffman, to assistant manager positions (though evidence adduced at trial demonstrated that Lapanne had been an assistant manager as far back as 1984, and that neither man assumed any new responsibilities or received any salary increase in connection with his new title).   Gilday continued to perform the clerical functions associated with Smith's former position.   When the second round of the reorganization wound down, the plant had three second-echelon managers--Paradis (operations);  Shevenell (manufacturing);  and Seeger (sales)--in lieu of the original seven.</p>\n      <p>B. Procedural History.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith sued Morse in a New Hampshire state court alleging, inter alia, wrongful discharge based on gender discrimination, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and breach of contract.   Morse removed the case to federal district court on the ground that Smith's claim \"arose under\" Title VII, thus prompting federal question jurisdiction.   See 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1331, 1343(a)(3), 1441, 1446;  see also 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367 (conferring ancillary jurisdiction over appended nonfederal claims).   Smith thereafter filed an amended complaint that made her Title VII claim explicit.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in the proceedings, Morse moved for partial summary judgment.   The district court (Stahl, J.) granted the motion on the common law wrongful discharge and emotional distress claims.  See Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., No. 90-361-S, slip op. at 12 (D.N.H. Sept. 26, 1991) (unpublished) (Smith I ).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several years later, the parties simultaneously tried the Title VII claim to the bench (McAuliffe, J.) and the breach of contract claim to a jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  At the close of the plaintiff's case, the district court entered judgment as a matter of law in the defendant's favor on the breach of contract claim and disbanded the jury.   The Title VII case proceeded before the district judge.   Morse asserted that it scrapped the materials manager's position and laid off the appellant as part of an overarching strategy to streamline a top-heavy managerial structure, and that even if Smith had not been on maternity leave she would have been flattened by the downsizing steamroller.   The district court agreed and entered judgment accordingly.   See Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></span>, 45 (D.N.H.1995) (Smith II ).   This appeal ensued.</p>\n      <p>II. THE TITLE VII CLAIM</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crown jewel of the appellant's asseverational array is her contention that the district court erred in finding that Morse did not discriminate against her on the basis of her sex.   Our appraisal of this contention is in three parts.</p>\n      <p>A. Standard of Review.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a bench trial, the court of appeals reviews the trier's factual determinations for clear error, see Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540783\"><a href=\"/opinion/540783/wilma-cumpiano-aka-wilma-cumpiano-sanchez-v-banco-santander-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 152 (1st Cir.1990);  Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), but affords plenary review to the trier's formulation of applicable legal rules, see Johnson v. Watts Regulator Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702493\"><a href=\"/opinion/702493/pens-plan-guide-p-23912p-james-johnson-v-watts-regulator-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1129</span></a></span>, 1132 (1st Cir.1995).   The jurisprudence of clear error constrains us from deciding factual issues anew.   See, e.g., Jackson v. Harvard Univ., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539800\"><a href=\"/opinion/539800/barbara-jackson-v-harvard-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span>, 466 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Indeed, we may not disturb the district court's record-rooted findings of fact unless on the whole of the evidence we reach the irresistible conclusion that a mistake has been made.

Similarly, findings regarding an actor's motivation fall within the shelter of Rule 52(a), and, therefore, if the trial court's reading of the record on such an issue is plausible, appellate review is at an end.   See Foster v. Dalton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709035\"><a href=\"/opinion/709035/69-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1402-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43789-sharon-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 56-57 (1st Cir.1995);  Anthony v.

The Jurisprudence of Title VII.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title VII provides, inter alia, that it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discharge an individual because of her sex.   See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(a)(1).   After the Supreme Court held that this phraseology did not proscribe discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, see General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109565\"><a href=\"/opinion/109565/general-elec-co-v-gilbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span>, 145-46, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109565\"><a href=\"/opinion/109565/general-elec-co-v-gilbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span> </a></span>(1976), Congress augmented Title VII by enacting the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA), Pub.L. 95-555, &#167; 1, 92 Stat. 2076, 2076 (1978) (codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e(k)).   The PDA made clear that:</p>\n      <p>The terms \"because of sex\" or \"on the basis of sex\" include, but are not limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions;  and women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs, as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e(k).   Thus, at the time Smith and Morse parted company, Title VII's ban on gender discrimination encompassed pregnancy-based discrimination.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like other Title VII plaintiffs, an employee claiming discrimination on the basis of pregnancy may proceed under either a disparate treatment or a disparate impact theory.   See generally Furnco Constr.  Corp. v. Waters, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109934\"><a href=\"/opinion/109934/furnco-constr-corp-v-waters/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span>, 575, 579-80, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109934\"><a href=\"/opinion/109934/furnco-constr-corp-v-waters/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span> </a></span>(1978) (explaining the dichotomy).   Here, the appellant alleged disparate treatment.   Consequently, she had the burden of proving that the defendant purposefully terminated her employment because of her pregnancy.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cases predating the Civil Rights Act of 1991, see supra note 3, the framework for proving intentional discrimination varies depending on the availability of direct evidence. See Fields v. Clark Univ., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584190\"><a href=\"/opinion/584190/rona-fields-v-clark-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 51-52 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1052</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Absent the evidentiary equivalent of a \"smoking gun,\" the plaintiff must attempt to prove her case by resort to a burden-shifting framework.   See Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110424\"><a href=\"/opinion/110424/texas-dept-of-community-affairs-v-burdine/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span>, 254-56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110424\"><a href=\"/opinion/110424/texas-dept-of-community-affairs-v-burdine/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span> </a></span>(1973).   Under this framework, a plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of pregnancy discrimination by showing that (1) she is pregnant (or has indicated an intention to become pregnant), (2) her job performance has been satisfactory, but (3) the employer nonetheless dismissed her from her position (or took some other adverse employment action against her) while (4) continuing to have her duties performed by a comparably qualified person.   See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540783\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Cumpiano,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/540783/wilma-cumpiano-aka-wilma-cumpiano-sanchez-v-banco-santander-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>;  Lipsett v.

Establishing the prima facie case raises a rebuttable presumption that discrimination sparked the adverse employment action, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540783\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Cumpiano,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/540783/wilma-cumpiano-aka-wilma-cumpiano-sanchez-v-banco-santander-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, and imposes upon the employer a burden to put forward a legitimate, nondiscriminatory motive for the action.

In those cases, direct evidence of discriminatory motive--say, an admission by the employer that it explicitly took actual or anticipated pregnancy into account in reaching an employment decision--serves to shift the burden of persuasion from employee to employer.   The latter must then affirmatively prove that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken the protected characteristic into account.   See Price Waterhouse v.

In many cases, the line between McDonnell Douglas, on one hand, and Price Waterhouse, on the other hand, is blurred.

We have here a good example of such a prudential approach.   The trial court largely bypassed any differential direct evidence/circumstantial evidence tamisage, preferring to go directly to a finding that, on the totality of the evidence presented, Morse had proven that gender discrimination did not trigger the firing.

While we agree with our concurring colleague that the decisional process is important, there comes a point at which slavish insistence upon process for its own sake serves only to exalt the trappings of justice over its substance.   Here, the district court's finding on causation, if sustainable, resolves the Title VII claim whether the appellant's prima facie case arises under the McDonnell Douglas or Price Waterhouse paradigm.

The court found that Morse carried the devoir of persuasion on this pivotal issue.   It concluded that Morse's decision was \"motivated by business judgment and represented an effort to economize by placing the most qualified personnel in the fewest number of managerial positions possible, and was not based on plaintiff's gender, pregnancy, or her expressed desire to have more children.\"  Smith <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">II,</span> <span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

This is merely a reflection of a central theme that permeates the relevant jurisprudence:  insofar as Title VII is concerned, an employer can hire or fire one employee instead of another for any reason, fair or unfair, provided that the employer's choice is not driven by race, gender, pregnancy, or some other protected characteristic.

When Morse took over, Damar had an inordinately high ratio of managers to workers and the managers' responsibilities overlapped.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Both Bond and Guimond testified that from the very start they believed that Damar's sprawling organizational structure defied rhyme or reason.   Accordingly, they set out to compress some of the sprawl.   The district court credited their intention, noting that the witnesses' actions matched their stated objective.   More to the point, Guimond testified that she terminated the appellant \"because I had a position that I no longer felt needed to be filled.\"   Bond testified in the same vein, indicating that he, too, had become convinced that Smith's position was expendable.   The court accepted this evidence, concluding that the materials manager's position would have been eliminated within the same time frame whether or not Smith had taken a maternity leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, this determination, while not inevitable, is supportable.   In the first place, the record strongly suggests that, in fact, the position was expendable.   In the second place, any other choice would have entailed a loss of engineering expertise that Damar could ill afford.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In the third place, the court's view is bolstered by the reception that the appellant originally received from the new ownership.   Bond and Guimond apprised her of the planned downsizing and assigned her significant new responsibilities when other managers were dismissed.   They also promoted her and increased her compensation.   These actions, undertaken with full knowledge that the appellant was pregnant and would be taking a six-week maternity leave, are inconsistent with a bias against pregnant employees.   In the fourth place, the district judge, sitting as the trier of fact, had the right to credit Bond's testimony that the \"maternity leave never played a role in itself\" because the same decision \"would have been made in a very close time frame,\" and Guimond's testimony to like effect.   In a bench trial, such credibility judgments are the judge's prerogative.   See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574884\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Anthony,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/574884/jane-anthony-v-bruce-g-sundlun/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">606</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the record could support a less innocuous conclusion.   The chronal proximity of Guimond's questions anent Smith's plans to have more children and her dismissal, Guimond's ill-advised suggestion that customers and employees be told that Smith decided to stay at home to care for her daughter, and Smith's termination while on maternity leave are troubling--so much so that we, if free to write a palimpsest, might have characterized the impetus behind the appellant's ouster differently.   But whether the trial court could have drawn an inference of discriminatory intent is not the test.

Yet, a position elimination defense is not defeated merely because another employee, already on the payroll, is designated to carry out some or all of the fired employee's duties in addition to his own, or because those duties are otherwise reallocated within the existing work force.   See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654585\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">LeBlanc,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/654585/theodore-l-leblanc-v-great-american-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span>;  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Barnes,</span> <span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1465</span></span>.   The elimination of a position signifies the employer's belief that it can get by with one less helper;  it does not necessarily convey a belief that the work the employee had been doing was superfluous and need not be performed at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the undisputed evidence before the district court indicates that after Guimond dismissed Smith, the position that Smith had occupied--materials manager--fell into desuetude.   There is no basis in the record for a suggestion that Lapanne or Hoffman assumed any of the appellant's former duties;  those duties, which Paradis, Shevenell, and Gilday had performed during Smith's leave, continued to be performed by them (or, at least, by Paradis and Gilday).   In short, the second round of the reorganization (which cost Smith her job) bore a striking resemblance to the first round (which gave Smith her promotion to materials manager).   Given these facts, the district judge's determination that Morse eliminated the appellant's position is unimpugnable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant next endeavors to surmount the sharp escarpment of the clearly erroneous rule by casting a hook at the legal standard applied by the trial court.   This is a theoretically sound way to climb the mountain, see, e.g., Reliance Steel Prods.  Co. v. National Fire Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526735\"><a href=\"/opinion/526735/reliance-steel-products-company-v-national-fire-insurance-company-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 577 (1st Cir.1989) (explaining that appellate courts review questions of law de novo, even after a bench trial), but in this case the hook does not hold.   The appellant's thesis is as follows.   She says that Title VII prohibits an employer from dismissing an employee while she is on maternity leave even if the employer, in the process of rationalizing its work force, discovers that her position is redundant and eliminates it for that reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Refined to bare essence, this thesis suggests that, since Morse would not have discovered the redundancy at that time (if ever) but for the fact that Smith took a maternity leave, the leave brought about the firing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  And the appellant attempts to drive this point home by citing Bond's testimony that \"because\" Smith was out on maternity leave, Morse was able to discover that her position was expendable--testimony which the appellant optimistically equates with an admission that Morse dismissed her \"because\" of her pregnancy.   With respect, we believe that this argument, which seeks to apply a black-letter legal principle in a totally mechanical fashion, plays mischievously on the mendacity of language by substituting sound for sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled under Title VII that an employer may not discharge an employee based on the categorical fact of her pregnancy.

By the same token, since a short-term inability to work is bound up with the very nature of pregnancy and childbirth, that disability is a pregnancy-related condition within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e(k), and Title VII thus prohibits an employer from dismissing an employee in retaliation for taking an authorized maternity leave.   Nevertheless, under the PDA, pregnancy does not confer total immunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  An employer may discharge an employee while she is pregnant if it does so for legitimate reasons unrelated to her pregnancy.

Title VII mandates that an employer must put an employee's pregnancy (including her departure on maternity leave) to one side in making its employment decisions--but the statute does not command that an employer bury its head in the sand and struthiously refrain from implementing business judgments simply because they affect a parturient employee.

At bottom, Title VII requires a causal nexus between the employer's state of mind and the protected trait (here, pregnancy).   The mere coincidence between that trait and the employment decision may give rise to an inference of discriminatory animus, see St. Mary's, 509 U.S. at <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">----,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Title VII is neither a shield against this broad spectrum of employer actions nor a statutory guaranty of full employment, come what may.   Applying the PDA as the appellant asks would eliminate an employer's business necessity defense--long recognized under Title VII--and cripple industry's ability to manage workers in keeping with nondiscriminatory considerations.   That is not the law.   See Bowen v.

By continuing her employment in the wake of such promises, her thesis runs, she accepted the offer.   The district court did not buy the patchwork, remarking in its ore tenus ruling that \"the promises described by the evidence are of insufficient definiteness to be enforceable, do not modify the at-will employment relationship, [and are such] that any calculation of damages or any identification of breach would be impracticable if not impossible.\"   We agree with the lower court that the terms of the alleged contract are too indefinite to raise a jury question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by attempting to decipher the true nature of the appellant's claim.   Her lawyers tell us that the disjointed statements made to her (e.g., \"don't worry, we will manage while you are on maternity leave, your job is secure,\" \"you will assume more responsibilities on your return,\" you are \"wanted back\") created a contract to reinstate her following the completion of her maternity leave.   Yet, the appellant concedes that Bond's and Guimond's statements did not alter the durational component of the at-will employment relationship.   A contract to reinstate an at-will employee to an at-will position (from which she could immediately be removed without cause) is no contract at all.   See Light v. Centel Cellular Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1525150\"><a href=\"/opinion/1525150/light-v-centel-cellular-co-of-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">883</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span>, 645 n. 5 (Tex.1994) (holding that, as long as the at-will character of the employment relationship remains unchanged, any \"promise made by either employer or employee that depends on an additional period of employment is illusory because it is conditioned upon something that is exclusively within the control of the promisor\");  E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts &#167;&#167; 2.13, 2.14 (2d ed. 1990) (explaining that promises to maintain an at-will relationship are illusory);  cf. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Butler,</span> <span class=\"volume\">629</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">94</span> </span>(terming an analytically equivalent argument \"a thin reed\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is this the only shortcoming in the supposed contract for reinstatement.   The evidence also fails to establish either the nature of the position Smith was to assume or her proposed rate of pay.

In stark contrast to the reinstatement theory proffered by her counsel, the appellant's own testimony indicates that she understood the statements made to her as promises of employment \"indefinitely,\" and as constituting an abiding \"commitment to a permanent position with F.W. Morse that would never end.\"   If, by this, she means to suggest a contract for lifetime employment, her claim also founders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although tangentially related New Hampshire precedents exist, the state supreme court has not explicitly addressed the contours of contracts for lifetime employment.

Under that law, even an at-will employee cannot be cashiered for a reason that offends public policy because such an employment decision \"is not in the best interest of the economic system or the public good and constitutes a breach of the employment contract,\" Monge v. Beebe Rubber Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2324231\"><a href=\"/opinion/2324231/monge-v-beebe-rubber-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></span>, 551 (1974).   The appellant urges that her severance offended the state's policy against gender-based discrimination.   In the court below, Judge Stahl ruled that when a statutory remedy is available, New Hampshire courts would not entertain a complaint that an at-will employee had been wrongfully discharged in violation of public policy.   Therefore, the appellant's common law claim for wrongful discharge failed because pregnancy discrimination is redressable under Title VII.

The New Hampshire Supreme Court construed its seminal decision in Monge, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></span>, \"to apply only to a situation where an employee is discharged because he performed an act that public policy would encourage, or refused to do that which public policy would condemn.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Howard,</span> <span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1274</span></span>.   A discharge due to age fell outside this \"narrow category\" inasmuch as the \"proper remedy for an action for unlawful age discrimination is provided for by statute.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (listing state </span>and federal statutory remedies).   In Cloutier, the court synthesized these cases, holding that to come within the judicially created public policy exception a plaintiff \"must show that the defendant was motivated by bad faith, malice, or retaliation in terminating [her] <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">employment,\"</span> <span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1143</span></span>, and must also \"demonstrate that [s]he was discharged because [s]he performed an act that public policy would encourage, or refused to do something that public policy would condemn,\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1144. </span> Cloutier did not answer, however, the question of whether such a cause of action lies where, as here, the public policy at stake is codified in a statute that itself provides a private right of action to remedy transgressions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A recently decided case makes the import of the state supreme court's earlier decisions pellucid and speaks directly to the question that confronts us here.   In Wenners v. Great State Beverages, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">663</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span> </span>(1995), the plaintiff relied on a section of the Bankruptcy Code to establish a public policy against the termination of his employment.   See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 625. </span>  The court held that \"[w]hile a plaintiff may not pursue a common law remedy where the legislature intended to replace it with a statutory cause of action,\" a wrongful discharge action could proceed if the relevant statutory provision did not provide a private cause of action for its violation.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (internal citations </span>omitted).   We deem this holding to be dispositive of Smith's contention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title VII not only codifies the public policy against gender-based discrimination (including, but not limited to, pregnancy discrimination) but also creates a private right of action to remedy violations of that policy and limns a mature procedure for pursuing such an action.   Under Wenners, the existence of such a remedy precludes the appellant, in the circumstances of this case, from asserting a common law claim for wrongful discharge.   It follows that the district court acted impeccably in granting summary judgment on this claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.

On the factbound Title VII claim, this case presents a close question.   In the end, however, we must uphold the district court's judgment because the standard of review is generous and there is enough evidence in the record to support the trier's findings.   On the two common law claims, our task is appreciably easier;  both claims raise questions of law, not of fact, and the district court--albeit in the person of two different district judges--correctly resolved them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I am compelled by the deference due a district court's findings of fact to concur in the final result, I write separately because I am troubled by the analysis used in deciding the Title VII claim.   The majority applauds the district court's failure to fully analyze Smith's claims as \"prudential.\"   I, however, am convinced that Smith produced direct evidence of intentional discrimination and that the district court was obligated to fully analyze plaintiff's case under the framework of Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112252\"><a href=\"/opinion/112252/price-waterhouse-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112252\"><a href=\"/opinion/112252/price-waterhouse-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Additionally, I think that the majority mischaracterizes the law relevant to the causation requirement under Title VII and Morse's position-elimination defense.   Its opinion could erroneously be viewed as an invitation to use that defense as a cover for discrimination against women who take or plan to take maternity leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.

The majority compounds this analytical omission by praising the district court for its \"directness\" and for having \"largely bypassed any differential direct evidence/circumstantial evidence tamisage.\"   A district court's decision to circumvent the analytical processes Supreme Court and circuit precedent require should be criticized, not praised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is particularly true where Title VII cases are concerned.   The discrimination that plaintiffs like Kathy Smith face in the workplace is frequently as subtle as it is invidious.   It is in recognition of this hard truth that the Supreme Court established an analytical process which district courts, in my opinion, are required to follow.   See, e.g., McDonnell <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Douglas,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">801</span></a></span>, 93 S.Ct. at 1823-24 (\"[I]n the implementation of [employment] decisions, it is abundantly clear that Title VII tolerates no ... discrimination, subtle or otherwise.\");   see also Price <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112252\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Waterhouse,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112252/price-waterhouse-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. at 1802.   The Court's jurisprudence stands for the principle that the unlawfulness of the employment actions typically challenged in Title VII cases is best exposed through a process of inquiry.   See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110424\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Burdine,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/110424/texas-dept-of-community-affairs-v-burdine/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">255</span> </a></span>n. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110424\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">8,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/110424/texas-dept-of-community-affairs-v-burdine/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This does not mean that I agree with the district court's finding that the evidence produced by Smith was not compelling.   I concur in the result because I am bound by Supreme Court and circuit precedent.   And in this area, that precedent, unfairly in my opinion, imposes too heavy a burden on plaintiffs trying to prove the ultimate issue in discrimination cases:  that the employer intentionally discriminated against her on the basis of a Title VII-protected trait.   I believe that Smith has produced enough evidence to meet her initial burden under Price Waterhouse or McDonnell Douglas, but agree that it would have been plausible for a factfinder to conclude that Morse proved its position-elimination defense by a preponderance of the evidence or, alternatively, that the facts established were insufficient to show pretext.   Although it did so without adhering to the process Title VII requires, the district court decided the ultimate issue in the case and, although I disagree with it, I cannot say that decision was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Direct Evidence Under Price Waterhouse</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of my concurrence in the majority's ultimate holding on Smith's Title VII claim, issues pertaining to the nature of the evidence Smith produced at trial are, admittedly, moot.   Nevertheless, I want to explain my belief that Smith produced direct evidence and that Price Waterhouse controls this case.   This is important for two reasons.   First, the availability of direct evidence determines whether a case should be analyzed under Price Waterhouse or McDonnell Douglas.   Direct evidence renders the McDonnell Douglas framework inapposite and imposes a heavier burden of proof on the employer.  Fuller v. Phipps, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"706000\"><a href=\"/opinion/706000/69-fair-emplpraccas-bna-111-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43751-charles-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1137</span></a></span>, 1141 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the determination of whether the evidence produced at trial is direct, though cast in procedural terms, affects the substantive outcome in Title VII cases.   See Deborah C. Malamud, The Last Minuet:  Disparate Treatment After Hicks, 93 Mich.L.Rev. 2229, 2229 (1995) (\"Title VII jurisprudence cloaks substance in the 'curious garb' of procedure.\").   This observation is of less import in Smith's case because, at the time the events giving rise to Smith's suit occurred, the law provided that an employer shown to have unlawfully discriminated could avoid Title VII liability by demonstrating by a preponderance of evidence that the adverse employment decision would have been the same even if discrimination had played no role.  Lam v. Univ. of Hawai'i, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"683150\"><a href=\"/opinion/683150/maivan-lam-v-university-of-hawaii-albert-simone-in-his-capacity-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1551</span></a></span>, 1564-65 (9th Cir.1994).   In other words, direct evidence of discrimination, without more, was not enough to impose liability on Morse.

Section 107 of the Act provides that Title VII is violated whenever an employer takes sex or pregnancy into account, regardless of whether other considerations independently explain the adverse employment decision.

Prevailing mixed-motives plaintiffs, at the very least, are now entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief and attorney's fees.   See Kerr-Selgas v. Am.  Airlines, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707599\"><a href=\"/opinion/707599/69-fair-emplpraccas-bna-944-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43780-mary-jane/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1205</span></a></span>, 1210 (1st Cir.1995) (citing 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B)) (where an employer in a mixed-motives case proves that it would have made the same decision, the prevailing plaintiff is entitled to attorney's fees, and declaratory and injunctive relief, but not damages or reinstatement).   Thus, what constitutes direct evidence is a critical issue for Title VII plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority makes repeated references to \"smoking gun\" evidence.   Using this term only obscures the fact that this Circuit has yet to clearly define what constitutes direct evidence of gender discrimination.   On prior occasions we have held that \"[d]irect evidence is evidence which, in and of itself, shows a discriminatory animus.\"   See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539800\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Jackson,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/539800/barbara-jackson-v-harvard-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>.   But, this reasoning is circular and does not further understanding of the term.   Justice O'Connor, in her concurring opinion in Price Waterhouse, defined the term in the negative, explaining that direct evidence \"exclude[s] 'stray remarks in the workplace,' 'statements by nondecisionmakers', or 'statements by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself.' \"  Price <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112252\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Waterhouse,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112252/price-waterhouse-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. at 1804-05 (O'Connor concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I contend that the evidence Smith produced at trial was direct and, therefore, warranted full application of the Price Waterhouse framework.   The evidence shows that Smith was pregnant, and requested and received unpaid maternity leave.   After being on leave several weeks, Smith notified Morse's general manager, Guimond, that she wanted to return to work on May 15, 1989, a week earlier than planned.   Guimond approved the earlier start time and assured Smith that her job was secure.   She also asked Smith whether she intended to have additional children;  Smith indicated that she did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 2, 1989, the day after this conversation occurred, Guimond also questioned Vendasi, Smith's sister, about Smith's future childbearing plans.   Smith confronted Guimond about this behavior and the rumor that she would not be returning to work because she had decided to stay home with her child.   Guimond denied any knowledge about the rumor and reiterated that Smith's job was secure;  she repeated this guarantee two days later.   Despite these assurances, Guimond terminated Smith on May 11, 1989, one week after their last conversation and four days before Smith was slated to return to work.   Guimond requested permission to tell people that Smith failed to return to work because she decided to stay home to care for her child, but Smith refused to give it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is precedent holding that statements like those Guimond made to Smith and Vendasi constitute direct evidence.   For example, in the Eighth Circuit, statements made by an employer can be direct evidence of discrimination, if made during a key decisional process.   In Beshears v. Asbill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559556\"><a href=\"/opinion/559556/kenneth-beshears-robert-johnson-v-ross-asbill-v-communications-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1348</span></a></span>, 1354 (8th Cir.1991), the court held that an employer's oral statement, \"older employees have problems adapting to changed and new policies,\" was direct evidence of age <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559556\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">discrimination.</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/559556/kenneth-beshears-robert-johnson-v-ross-asbill-v-communications-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1354</span></a></span>.   Two years later, the court expanded its Beshears holding to include written statements.  Radabaugh v. Zip Feed Mills, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610655\"><a href=\"/opinion/610655/dean-radabaugh-v-zip-feed-mills-inc-tom-batcheller-don-kjelden/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span>, 449-50 (8th Cir.1993), held that written statements included in corporate planning documents were also direct evidence of discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other circuits have included statements made outside of the decisional process in the definition of direct evidence.   In 1994, the Seventh Circuit held that post-discharge statements made by a supervisor were direct evidence of age bias, even though they were not reflective of an express intent to discriminate.   See Robinson v. PPG Indus., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669720\"><a href=\"/opinion/669720/64-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1690-64-empl-prac-dec-p-43019-ronald/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1159</span></a></span>, 1165 (7th Cir.1994).   Similarly, the Eleventh Circuit has held that statements made by an employer to third parties are direct evidence of discriminatory animus.   In EEOC v. Beverage Canners, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1067</span></span>, 1070 (11th Cir.1990), the court found that racially biased statements made by a supervisor to workers in his plant were direct evidence of racial animus and a hostile environment under Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guimond's statements to both Smith and Vendasi fall well within the definition of direct evidence established by cases such as Beshears and Beverage Canners.   Guimond was solely responsible for Morse's personnel decisions.   Her questions about Smith's childbearing plans were neither stray nor random and evinced a concern about future pregnancy.   Additionally, Guimond began asking questions about Smith's childbearing plans during what she admits was a key decisional period.   Finally, the facts show that the timing of the decision to terminate Smith was suspicious.   Cf. Troupe v. May Dep't Stores, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666886\"><a href=\"/opinion/666886/kimberly-hern-troupe-v-the-may-department-stores-company-doing-business/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span></a></span>, 736 (7th Cir.1994);  Josey v.

Within two weeks of learning about Smith's plans to have more children, Guimond decided to terminate Smith, even though she had repeatedly assured Smith that her job was secure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence of discrimination is direct and clear even if it does not reach the status of a smoking gun.   That some inferences must be drawn from what was said and done to reach this conclusion does not make Smith's evidence indirect.   As the Seventh Circuit recognized in its 1991 decision, Visser v. Packer Eng'g Assoc., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555097\"><a href=\"/opinion/555097/philip-r-visser-v-packer-engineering-associates-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span>, 659 (7th Cir.1991), \"all knowledge is inferential.\"   Because judges are not mind-readers and cannot reach into the mind of a Title VII defendant, a certain amount of inference-drawing is necessary in any case, whether the evidence is direct or indirect.   The ultimate issue in disparate treatment cases--whether the employer intended to discriminate--cannot be established by purely direct evidence.   See Charles A. Sullivan, Accounting For Price Waterhouse:  Proving Disparate Treatment Under Title VII, 56 Brook.L.Rev. 1107, 1138 (1991) (\" '[D]irect evidence' of intent cannot exist, at least in the sense of evidence which, if believed, would establish the ultimate issue of intent to discriminate.\");  Tyler v.

In accord with the Civil Rights Act of 1991, this definition preserves the mixed-motives case as a viable option in Title VII suits.   Cf. Michael A. Zubrensky, Despite The Smoke, There Is No Gun:  Direct Evidence Requirements In Mixed-Motives Employment Law After Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 46 Stan.L.Rev. 959, 969 (1994).   It lowers the high hurdle of \"smoking gun\" evidence to reasonable limits so that plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases can receive all the protections Title VII was intended to give.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if my definition of Price Waterhouse direct evidence is rejected, however, it is irrefutable that Smith made out a prima facie case of discrimination under McDonnell Douglas:  that after being directly so asked, she expressed an intention to become pregnant in the future;  that her performance at work was more than satisfactory;  that she was terminated after repeated assurances that her job was \"secure;\"  and that her duties continued to be performed by comparably qualified individuals.

Smith proved that she was fired even though she was an excellent manager and that her duties continued to be performed by other employees.   In my view, this is all McDonnell Douglas' prima facie case burden requires.   See, e.g., Byrd v. Ronayne, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196234\"><a href=\"/opinion/196234/byrd-v-ronayne/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1026</span></a></span>, 1031 (1st Cir.1995) (\"[T]he required prima facie showing is not especially burdensome.\")  (citing Woodman v.

The district court should have shifted to the McDonnell Douglas framework before finding Smith's evidence deficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Causation Under Title VII</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing the question of causation in disparate treatment cases, the majority stresses that a \"coincidence\" between pregnancy leave and an employment decision does not prove intentional discrimination.   It may not in all cases, but it arguably did in this case.   The majority's discussion of causation completely disregards this possibility.   Its blanket contention that pregnancy does not give plaintiffs \"total immunity\" from adverse employment actions ignores the extent to which maternity leave gives employers an opportunity to discharge women who take maternity leave or who express an intention to have one or more children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence arguably shows that the position Smith held would have been eliminated even if Morse had not considered her pregnancy or intention to become pregnant in the future.   It does not necessarily follow from this, however, that Smith would have been fired had Morse not considered her maternity leave or desire to have more children.   In their conversations before Smith took maternity leave, Bond, Morse's president, and Guimond discussed eliminating the materials manager position, but not Smith.   The record shows both that Bond initially intended to retain Smith because of her excellent skills and that he admitted that Smith would still be employed at Morse had she not taken maternity leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had Smith refused to disclose or even lied about her intention to have more children, she would probably still have a job at Morse.   The facts show that Guimond was very concerned about the disruption Smith's absence would cause and suggest that she would have taken steps to avoid such disruption in the future.   The majority completely ignores the probability that Smith's expressed desire to have more children was the motivating factor in her discharge and that her temporary absence on maternity leave gave her employer an opportunity to find a reason to discharge her.   I contend that the evidence Smith produced was sufficient to establish intent and causation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two examples the majority gives to illustrate the need for a causal connection between pregnancy and the adverse employment action challenged in disparate treatment cases are both inapposite and unfair.   Footnote 9 of the court's opinion analogizes Smith's dismissal during maternity leave to an employee who is discharged while on religious leave because heroin is discovered in her desk.   It is true that in both cases the employee's absence enabled the employer to make the discovery resulting in discharge.   But here the analogy breaks down.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The possession of heroin is illegal;  its presence in the employee's desk was a fact that could not be refuted (although an explanation might be made).   The employer did not have to make any determination as to the quality of the employee's work or her capabilities.   She had to be fired.   In the case of maternity leave, however, an employer would have to make a judgment as to whether eliminating the position made good business sense.   Considerations such as the employee's prior performance and future childbearing plans would be part of the employer's position-elimination decision.   At least in part, that decision would be \"because of\" pregnancy, present and future.   It could not be made in the vacuum the majority's hypothetical presupposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the cases the majority cites to support its view obscure the causation issue and unfairly compare Smith to employees who are placed on probation because of poor attitudes or who are discharged because of unexcused absences.   Cases such as Troupe v. May Dep't Stores Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666886\"><a href=\"/opinion/666886/kimberly-hern-troupe-v-the-may-department-stores-company-doing-business/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span> </a></span>(7th Cir.1994), Crnokrak v. Evangelical Health Systems Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span> </span>(N.D.Ill.1993), and Johnson v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">433</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span> </span>(1984), involved discharge, not position elimination.   In Troupe, the employee's pre-maternity leave dismissal was motivated by her tardiness and frequent absences.  Crnokrak involved a plaintiff who was terminated after returning from maternity leave later than originally expected, whereas Johnson dealt with an employee who lacked supervisory skills and who was fired after being placed on probation because of a poor work attitude.   The one position-elimination case the majority cites, Pearlstein v. Staten Island Univ.  Hosp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span> </span>(E.D.N.Y.1995), is similarly inapposite;  it involved adoption, not pregnancy, and an employee who gave short notice of her need for maternity leave.   And in that case, the evidence showed that the plaintiff was accidentally overpaid, that her employer was experiencing financial difficulties, and that she had received no assurances about the security of her job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These cases do not directly address the causation issues presented here.   In contrast to Pearlstein, the evidence in this case shows that Smith received repeated assurances about her job, that the raise she received before taking maternity leave was intentional, and that Smith's termination was not due to economic hardship.   Additionally, the evidence does not show that Smith was fired for a poor attitude, that she had ever been on probation, or that she lacked supervisory skills.   The fact that Smith received regular promotions and that few people at the Morse plant exceeded her level of education or experience belies any suggestion that Smith's performance and skills were below par.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Smith received permission for her maternity leave, shortened the duration of that leave, and was fired before she could return to work, not before she left.   Smith's maternity leave, thus, did not pose a problem for Morse in the same way that the Troupe employee's unexpected illness or the Crnokrak plaintiff's extended leave did for their employers.   The crux of Morse's defense, after all, is that Smith was fired because her absence had no effect whatsoever on Morse's operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My point is simple:  just as pregnancy does not fully shield plaintiffs from adverse employment actions, business judgment or necessity does not totally immunize employers from Title VII's sanctions.   The majority's discussion of causation understates this important point.   I believe that, more often than not, a correlation between pregnancy and position elimination during maternity leave will exist.   It is naive to think that an employer would not take an employee's pregnancy or intention to become pregnant in the future into consideration during the process of determining whether the employee's position should be eliminated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. The Position-Elimination Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority upholds the district court's finding that Morse made out a position-elimination defense on two grounds:  that Morse reduced its management-level staff and that Smith's duties were shifted to employees who were already on the Morse payroll.   Though I concur in the holding that Morse arguably proved the facts necessary to rebut Smith's gender discrimination claim, I think the scope of the position-elimination defense is considerably more narrow than the majority's interpretation of the facts suggests.   That a company is able to manage in the absence of one of its key employees will not always be proof of a nondiscriminatory purpose, contrary to what the court's opinion implies.   Were that so, every woman who took maternity leave would do so at risk of losing her job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the conclusion that Morse reduced its management staff is not supported by the evidence.   Morse did not, as the court's exposition of the facts suggests, reduce its management team from seven to three.   The majority reached this conclusion by eliminating Bond and Guimond from its final count, even though they each donned one of the two hats formerly worn by Darryl Robinson, Damar's founder and chief officer.   It also erroneously included Smith in Damar's original management team, even though she did not have a management title at that time.   And it failed to include the two assistant manager positions in its final count, even though the individuals holding those slots did have management titles.   If the individuals excluded from the majority's calculations are added, the size of Morse's management team was the same at the end as it was in the beginning--seven.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts demonstrate that Morse mainly reorganized its management team.   It consolidated positions and eliminated titles, but did not decrease the size of its management.   Because it would have been plausible for the district court to interpret this reorganization as position elimination, I concur in the court's holding.   I do not agree, however, that reorganizations of the sort Morse carried out will be enough to rebut claims of intentional discrimination in every case.   For me, whether the district court was clearly erroneous in its findings on this issue was a very close call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's holding that Smith was not replaced, that her duties were merely transferred to other Morse employees, is based on our holding in LeBlanc v. Great Am.  Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654585\"><a href=\"/opinion/654585/theodore-l-leblanc-v-great-american-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span> </span>(1994).  LeBlanc holds that a position-elimination defense is not defeated by the claim that an employee was only \"replaced\" because \"another employee [was] assigned to perform the plaintiff's duties in addition to other duties, or [because] the work [was] redistributed among other existing employees already performing related <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654585\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">work.\"</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/654585/theodore-l-leblanc-v-great-american-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span>;  see also Barnes v.

In analogizing Morse's first reorganization to the reorganization which occurred after Smith's firing, the majority opinion gives the impression that LeBlanc 's second prong, the \"related work\" requirement, can be satisfied by demonstrating that a plaintiff's duties were simply transferred to someone working in the same company.   I disagree.   I contend that LeBlanc 's related-work requirement cannot be met unless the employer proves that it shifted the plaintiff's duties to employees who were already performing some of the plaintiff's duties or, at least, duties that were very similar.   This did not occur in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first reorganization, Smith was promoted to materials manager and asked to officially assume some of the duties she had already been performing because of the inadequacies of other managers.   Smith at that time assumed duties which, in my opinion, constituted related work under LeBlanc.   In contrast, the second reorganization did not shift Smith's responsibilities to managers who had already been performing her job.   After Smith was fired, those managers took on what were essentially new duties;  the majority's own contention that Paradis and Shevenell were far more experienced than Smith and responsible for the technical aspects of Morse's business bears this out.   That they performed those duties for some period before Smith was fired was only because Smith was on maternity leave.   The nonpregnancy-based explanation for their additional responsibilities did not kick in until after Smith's firing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Title VII's protections against pregnancy-based discrimination are to have any force, the relevant period of inquiry for determining whether the duties formerly performed by a plaintiff were assumed by someone already performing related work under LeBlanc should not be during a maternity leave.   The relevant period of inquiry must be before that leave began.   Using the time period when the woman is on maternity leave creates a perverse incentive to discriminate against pregnant women by firing them when they are not at their jobs and when it will almost always be true that someone else is performing their duties.   In this case, if Smith had not become pregnant and taken maternity leave, she would still be a valued Morse employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">William James once said that an idea's \"validity is the process of its valid-ation.\"   Accordingly, I concur in the outcome reached in this case, but not the process employed, because I disagree with the view of pregnancy discrimination cases taken by the majority.   I think it only plausible that gender was not the motivation for the adverse employment action taken against Smith, not \"true.\"   And I agree only that position elimination can be a defense in Title VII cases, not that it will be a defense in every case.   For me, the process employed in reaching a result, which includes the hypotheticals drawn and examples given, matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> During this same time frame, the company eliminated the engineering manager's position.
