LENNON,\r\n\n   Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n             v.\r\n\nROBERT RUBIN, SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY,\r\n\n    Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n                        \r\n\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n[Hon. Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\r\n[Hon. William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n                        \r\n\n           Before\r\n\n   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\nGibson, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\nand Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   \r\n\nEdward L. Hoban for appellant.\r\nRayford A. Farquhar, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom\r\nDonald K. Stern, U.S. Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.    \r\n\n                        \r\n\n      February 3, 1999\r\n                         \r\n\nLYNCH, Circuit Judge.  John J. Lennon filed an action\r\nasserting that his employer, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and\r\nFirearms (\"ATF\") in the Department of the Treasury, retaliated\r\nagainst him in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment\r\nAct (\"ADEA\") and Title VII for filing age discrimination claims,\r\ndiscriminated against him in violation of Title VII on the basis\r\nof his status as a white male, and violated the Privacy Act\r\nthrough prohibited recordkeeping and disclosure of information. \r\nLennon appeals from Judge Young's dismissal of his retaliation\r\nclaims and Judge Lindsay's grant of summary judgment to the\r\ndefendant on Lennon's remaining claims.  We affirm.\r\nWe outline the most salient facts only briefly. \r\nLennon was a \"GS-1811-12, Criminal Investigator, Special Agent\"\r\nat ATF.  Prior to November 1992, he made a number of age-based\r\ndiscrimination and retaliation complaints against Terence\r\nMcArdle, the \"Special Agent in Charge\" of the Boston ATF office\r\nwho was one of Lennon's supervisors.  \"On November 10, 1992,\r\nwhile driving in an automobile with [an African-American ATF\r\nagent], as the result of a near accident, Lennon made a\r\nspontaneous remark that would be considered racially\r\nderogatory.\"  Amended Complaint  6.  After the agent\r\ncomplained, Lennon was suspended for three days.\r\nOn April 17, 1995, the ATF announced a vacancy for a\r\nGS-1811-13 Senior Operations Officer, for which Lennon applied\r\nand was placed on the \"best qualified\" list.  McArdle ultimately\r\nselected Joycelyn Christopher, an African-American woman, to\r\nfill the position.\r\nLennon filed suit on October 16, 1996.  After the\r\ndefendant moved to dismiss all of the retaliation claims, Judge\r\nYoung granted the motion, stating in a written order that the\r\nTitle VII retaliation counts failed to state a claim because\r\nLennon's underlying complaints of discrimination had been based\r\non age, not on race, color, sex or national origin.  Both\r\nparties subsequently moved for summary judgment on the remaining\r\nclaims.  In a ruling from the bench, Judge Lindsay denied\r\nLennon's motion and granted summary judgment to the defendant on\r\nthe discrimination and Privacy Act claims, remarking with\r\nrespect to the former that \"if the plaintiff could make a prima\r\nfacie case, he is unable to establish a triable issue[] that the\r\n. . . nondiscriminatory reason[] offered by the government [is]\r\npretext.\"\r\nWe review the disposition of a motion to dismiss de\r\nnovo, taking the alleged facts to be true.  See LaChapelle v.\r\nBerkshire Life Ins. Co., 142 F.3d 507, 509 (1st Cir. 1998).  We\r\nlikewise review the district court's grant of summary judgment\r\nde novo, considering the facts in the light most favorable to\r\nthe nonmoving party.  See Udo v. Tomes, 54 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.\r\n1995).  However, we review the district court's decision as to\r\n\"the evidentiary materials it will consider in deciding a motion\r\nfor summary judgment\" only for \"a clear abuse of discretion.\" \r\nEEOC v. Green, 76 F.3d 19, 24 (1st Cir. 1996); see also Schubertv. Nissan Motor Corp., 148 F.3d 25, 29-30 (1st Cir. 1998).  \r\nWe reject Lennon's challenge to the district court's\r\ndismissal of his Title VII claims for retaliation based on age\r\ndiscrimination complaints.  Lennon grounds his argument that\r\nTitle VII covers age-related retaliation complaints on the\r\nlanguage of 42 U.S.C.  2000e-16(c), which protects employees of\r\nthe federal government.  That section states:\r\nWithin 90 days of receipt of notice of final action\r\ntaken by a department, agency, or unit referred to in\r\nsubsection (a) of this section, or by the Equal\r\nEmployment Opportunity Commission upon an appeal from\r\na decision or order of such department, agency, or\r\nunit on a complaint of discrimination based on race,\r\ncolor, religion, sex or national origin, brought\r\npursuant to subsection (a) of this section, Executive\r\nOrder 11478 or any succeeding Executive orders, or\r\nafter one hundred and eighty days from the filing of\r\nthe initial charge . . . , an employee . . . , if\r\naggrieved by the final disposition of his complaint,\r\nor by the failure to take final action on his\r\ncomplaint, may file a civil action as provided in\r\nsection 2000e-5 of this title . . . .\r\n\nLennon notes that Executive Order 11478 has been amended to\r\nprohibit agencies from discrimination based on age and claims\r\nthat this prohibition is incorporated into Title VII through the\r\nreference to the Executive Order. \r\nLennon's argument founders on the plain language of\r\nthe statute.  The provision on which Lennon relies specifically\r\nstates that the complaint of discrimination must be \"based on\r\nrace, color, religion, sex or national origin.\"  Executive Order\r\n11478 is merely one example of the various prohibitions on\r\nexecutive branch discrimination that such a complaint may be\r\n\"brought pursuant to.\"  42 U.S.C.  2000e-16(c); see also id. \r\n2000e-16(a) (stating that federal employment \"shall be made free\r\nfrom any discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or\r\nnational origin\"); cf. Fears v. Catlin, 377 F. Supp. 291, 293\r\n(D. Colo. 1974) (noting that Executive Order 11478 was enacted\r\nin 1969 and that \"it appears that  2000e-16(c) was meant to\r\ncover claims that arose prior to the enactment of [Title VII's\r\nsection on federal employees]\").  The fact that the Executive\r\nOrder forbids age discrimination as well as race and sex\r\ndiscrimination does not expand the categories on which a\r\ncomplaint may be based or the reach of Title VII.\r\nFurther, Lennon's construction would render\r\nsuperfluous the ADEA's prohibition on age discrimination against\r\nfederal government employees.  See 29 U.S.C.  633a; see alsoLavery v. Marsh, 918 F.2d 1022, 1025 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[T]he\r\nADEA amendment prohibiting federal-sector age discrimination was\r\npatterned after 42 U.S.C. section 2000e-16(a), (b), the\r\namendments to Title VII extending that statute's protection to\r\nfederal employees.\").  Accordingly, since Lennon's previous\r\ncomplaints related to age rather than to a category protected\r\nunder Title VII, his retaliation claims are not cognizable under\r\nTitle VII. \r\nLennon also challenges the district court's dismissal\r\nof his claim of retaliation in violation of the ADEA.  We are\r\nhampered in our review of this dismissal by the fact that\r\nneither Lennon nor the defendant ever identifies the basis given\r\nby the court for the ruling.  Lennon, without record support,\r\nstates that the court's ruling was based on an interpretation of\r\nthe relevant statute; the government's motion to dismiss\r\nsuggests it was based on the facts alleged.  A transcript of the\r\njudge's ruling from the bench has not been provided by the\r\nparties and does not appear in the record transferred from the\r\ndistrict court (most likely because no one ordered a\r\ntranscription of the proceedings).  \"It is appellants'\r\nresponsibility to provide the court with intelligible briefs and\r\nappendices sufficient to support their points on appeal, failing\r\nwhich the court in its discretion . . . may scrutinize the\r\nmerits of the case insofar as the record permits, or may dismiss\r\nthe appeal if the absence of a [record] thwarts intelligent\r\nreview.  Accordingly, . . . wherever material uncertainties\r\nresult from an incomplete or indecipherable record and impede or\r\naffect our decision, we resolve such uncertainties against\r\nappellants.\"  Credit Francais International, S.A. v. Bio-Vita,\r\nLtd., 78 F.3d 698, 700-01 (1st Cir. 1996) (citations and\r\ninternal quotation marks omitted).  Lennon has not adequately\r\nprovided a record and his discussion of this claim is a cursory\r\none (including no analysis of the statute that apparently needs\r\nto be interpreted and consisting of an assertion that he has\r\nestablished a prima facie case and a citation to an ADEA case\r\ninvolving a federal employee that did not analyze 29 U.S.C.\r\n633a, the relevant ADEA section).  See generally United Statesv. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"It is not enough\r\nmerely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way,\r\nleaving the court to do counsel's work, create the ossature for\r\nthe argument, and put flesh on its bones.\").  We decline to\r\ndisturb the district court's ruling.\r\nWe also uphold the district court's grant of summary\r\njudgment on Lennon's Title VII race and sex discrimination\r\nclaims.  As an initial matter, we find no abuse of discretion in\r\nthe district court's denial of Lennon's motion to strike the\r\ndeclaration of Daniel M. Hartnett.  That declaration concerned\r\nwhich ATF employee had official responsibility to fill the\r\nSenior Operations Officer position that Lennon claims he was\r\nillegally denied.  The motion to strike was based on an alleged\r\nlack of personal knowledge by the declarant and on the\r\ncontention that the declaration drew a legal conclusion. \r\nHowever, the district court could reasonably have found that\r\nHartnett, former Deputy Director and Associate Director of Law\r\nEnforcement at ATF, was competent to discuss the existence and\r\neffect of various ATF orders that were issued during his tenure. \r\nIn any event, eliminating Hartnett's declaration from\r\nconsideration in connection with the summary judgment motions\r\nwould not make a difference in the outcome.  See New England\r\nAnti-Vivisection Soc'y, Inc. v. United States Surgical Corp.,\r\n889 F.2d 1198, 1204 (1st Cir. 1990).  Lennon focuses on the\r\nwrong question.  He focuses on the selecting authority, argues\r\nthat through the mechanical operation of various ATF orders\r\nthere was no delegation of selecting authority for the position\r\nat issue for a period of approximately four years, and concludes\r\nthat \"[t]he penalty for not being completely faithful to you own\r\nplan [sic] is you lose.\"  But Lennon never contests the fact\r\nthat an ATF employee named Terence McArdle actually chose an\r\nAfrican-American woman, Joycelyn Christopher, over Lennon for\r\nthe operations position, or that the ATF enforced McArdle's\r\nchoice.  Whether McArdle lost his official authorization is not\r\ndeterminative of whether the actual selection was discriminatory\r\non the basis of race or sex, and does not itself invalidate the\r\ndefendant's articulation of a \"legitimate, nondiscriminatory\r\nreason\" for the employment action.  Udo, 54 F.3d at 12 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted).\r\nDefendant did indeed articulate such a\r\nnondiscriminatory reason (we bypass whether Lennon adequately\r\nestablished a prima facie case of race and sex discrimination). \r\nDefendant presented evidence that the Senior Operations Officer\r\nposition requires, inter alia, an ability to work well with\r\nothers, to exercise discretion, tact, and diplomacy, and to\r\nresolve conflicts.  Defendant also presented evidence that,\r\nwhile Christopher (the person selected) excelled in these areas\r\nand had successfully performed some of the required functions,\r\nLennon had difficulty working with others, was not tactful, and\r\nvoiced his opinions without restraint.  Defendant documented a\r\nnumber of specific incidents to back up these assessments,\r\nincluding one in which Lennon used a racially derogatory term in\r\nfront of an African-American ATF agent with whom he was working.\r\nWe have carefully examined all of the evidence\r\npresented by Lennon, including the evidence that Lennon claims\r\nwas not considered by the district court, and we agree with the\r\ndistrict court's conclusion that Lennon did not counter the\r\ndefendant's articulated reason by \"introduc[ing] sufficient\r\nevidence . . . (1) that the employer's articulated reason for\r\n[its treatment of] the plaintiff is a pretext, and (2) that the\r\ntrue reason is discriminatory.\"  Mulero-Rodriguez v. Ponte,\r\nInc., 98 F.3d 670, 674 (1st Cir. 1996) (emphasis added); see\r\nalso Shorette v. Rite Aid of Maine, Inc., 155 F.3d 8, 12-13 (1st\r\nCir. 1998).  Taken most favorably to Lennon, some of the\r\nevidence he presented to the district court might raise a\r\nsuggestion of pretext, but a reasonable factfinder could not\r\nmake a finding of discriminatory animus.  See Fisher v. Vassar\r\nCollege, 114 F.3d 1332, 1337 (2d Cir. 1997) (en banc)\r\n(\"Individual decision-makers may intentionally dissemble in\r\norder to hide a reason that is non-discriminatory but unbecoming\r\nor small-minded, such as back-scratching, log-rolling, horse-\r\ntrading, institutional politics, envy, nepotism, spite, or\r\npersonal hostility.\"), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 851 (1998).  \r\nThe district court also correctly granted summary\r\njudgment on Lennon's claim of improper disclosure of records in\r\nviolation of the Privacy Act.  Lennon came forward with a memo\r\nfrom one M.J. Wilkins, an employee in the ATF Employee and Labor\r\nRelations Branch, stating that she was forwarding a package of\r\nmaterials relating to Lennon to the \"ATF EEO Task Force,\" a\r\ngroup that included individuals from outside the agency. \r\nHowever, Wilkins testified that she actually gave the package\r\nonly to Marjorie Kornegay, the ATF's Assistant Director for\r\nEqual Employment Opportunity Programs and a member of the Task\r\nForce, and Kornegay declared that she never gave the package to\r\nthe other Task Force members and that the Task Force never\r\nreviewed any material relating to Lennon.  See 5 U.S.C. \r\n552a(b)(1).  Lennon weakly responds that whether the file was\r\nactually reviewed by the Task Force \"is the question of fact\r\nthat the plaintiff wants decided by a fact finder, not an\r\naffidavit,\" and that the question \"cannot be decided by some\r\nsort of statement from Kornegay.\"  These arguments misapprehend\r\nLennon's burden at the summary judgment stage, where \"[b]rash\r\nconjecture, coupled with earnest hope that something concrete\r\nwill eventually materialize, is insufficient.\"  Dow v. United\r\nBhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners, 1 F.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir. 1993); see\r\nalso Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir.\r\n1991) (\"Genuine issues of material fact are not the stuff of an\r\nopposing party's dreams.  On issues where the nonmovant bears\r\nthe ultimate burden of proof, he must present definite,\r\ncompetent evidence to rebut the motion.\").  On the evidence\r\npresented, no reasonable factfinder could find that there was an\r\nimpermissible disclosure.\r\nFinally, our de novo review discloses no error in the\r\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment for the defendant on\r\nLennon's Privacy Act claim that the defendant intentionally or\r\nwillfully maintained illegal systems of records that had an\r\nadverse effect on him.  See 5 U.S.C.  552a(g)(1), (4).  We\r\npause only to note that the district court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in failing to strike Exhibits 14 and 15 to\r\ndefendant's statement of undisputed material facts, which\r\nconsisted of charts listing and describing each allegedly\r\nillegally maintained record and citing a source of authority for\r\nthe maintenance of each record.  Lennon contends that these\r\nexhibits were not authenticated and do not fall into the class\r\nof materials identified in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. \r\nHowever, since all but one of the records listed and described\r\nin the exhibits were separately reproduced elsewhere in\r\ndefendant's submission, and since the remainder of the exhibits\r\nconsists of citations to and quotations from legal authority,\r\nthe district court was entitled to consider the exhibits, which\r\nwere referenced in defendant's memoranda of law, as legal\r\nargument not subject to strictures on evidentiary submissions. \r\nWe have considered all of Lennon's properly presented\r\narguments and find them without merit.  Accordingly, the\r\njudgment of the district court is affirmed. \n",

The fact that the Executive\r\nOrder forbids age discrimination as well as race and sex\r\ndiscrimination does not expand the categories on which a\r\ncomplaint may be based or the reach of Title VII.\r\nFurther, Lennon's construction would render\r\nsuperfluous the ADEA's prohibition on age discrimination against\r\nfederal government employees.

Accordingly, since Lennon's previous\r\ncomplaints related to age rather than to a category protected\r\nunder Title VII, his retaliation claims are not cognizable under\r\nTitle VII. \r\nLennon also challenges the district court's dismissal\r\nof his claim of retaliation in violation of the ADEA.  We are\r\nhampered in our review of this dismissal by the fact that\r\nneither Lennon nor the defendant ever identifies the basis given\r\nby the court for the ruling.  Lennon, without record support,\r\nstates that the court's ruling was based on an interpretation of\r\nthe relevant statute; the government's motion to dismiss\r\nsuggests it was based on the facts alleged.  A transcript of the\r\njudge's ruling from the bench has not been provided by the\r\nparties and does not appear in the record transferred from the\r\ndistrict court (most likely because no one ordered a\r\ntranscription of the proceedings).  \"It is appellants'\r\nresponsibility to provide the court with intelligible briefs and\r\nappendices sufficient to support their points on appeal, failing\r\nwhich the court in its discretion . . . may scrutinize the\r\nmerits of the case insofar as the record permits, or may dismiss\r\nthe appeal if the absence of a [record] thwarts intelligent\r\nreview.

We decline to\r\ndisturb the district court's ruling.\r\nWe also uphold the district court's grant of summary\r\njudgment on Lennon's Title VII race and sex discrimination\r\nclaims.  As an initial matter, we find no abuse of discretion in\r\nthe district court's denial of Lennon's motion to strike the\r\ndeclaration of Daniel M. Hartnett.  That declaration concerned\r\nwhich ATF employee had official responsibility to fill the\r\nSenior Operations Officer position that Lennon claims he was\r\nillegally denied.  The motion to strike was based on an alleged\r\nlack of personal knowledge by the declarant and on the\r\ncontention that the declaration drew a legal conclusion. \r\nHowever, the district court could reasonably have found that\r\nHartnett, former Deputy Director and Associate Director of Law\r\nEnforcement at ATF, was competent to discuss the existence and\r\neffect of various ATF orders that were issued during his tenure. \r\nIn any event, eliminating Hartnett's declaration from\r\nconsideration in connection with the summary judgment motions\r\nwould not make a difference in the outcome.

Lennon focuses on the\r\nwrong question.  He focuses on the selecting authority, argues\r\nthat through the mechanical operation of various ATF orders\r\nthere was no delegation of selecting authority for the position\r\nat issue for a period of approximately four years, and concludes\r\nthat \"[t]he penalty for not being completely faithful to you own\r\nplan [sic] is you lose.\"  But Lennon never contests the fact\r\nthat an ATF employee named Terence McArdle actually chose an\r\nAfrican-American woman, Joycelyn Christopher, over Lennon for\r\nthe operations position, or that the ATF enforced McArdle's\r\nchoice.  Whether McArdle lost his official authorization is not\r\ndeterminative of whether the actual selection was discriminatory\r\non the basis of race or sex, and does not itself invalidate the\r\ndefendant's articulation of a \"legitimate, nondiscriminatory\r\nreason\" for the employment action.  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"695510\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Udo,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/695510/67-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1001-66-empl-prac-dec-p-43607-udo-u-udo/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">12</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(internal\r\nquotation marks omitted).\r\nDefendant did indeed articulate such a\r\nnondiscriminatory reason (we bypass whether Lennon adequately\r\nestablished a prima facie case of race and sex discrimination). \r\nDefendant presented evidence that the Senior Operations Officer\r\nposition requires, inter alia, an ability to work well with\r\nothers, to exercise discretion, tact, and diplomacy, and to\r\nresolve conflicts.  Defendant also presented evidence that,\r\nwhile Christopher (the person selected) excelled in these areas\r\nand had successfully performed some of the required functions,\r\nLennon had difficulty working with others, was not tactful, and\r\nvoiced his opinions without restraint.  Defendant documented a\r\nnumber of specific incidents to back up these assessments,\r\nincluding one in which Lennon used a racially derogatory term in\r\nfront of an African-American ATF agent with whom he was working.\r\nWe have carefully examined all of the evidence\r\npresented by Lennon, including the evidence that Lennon claims\r\nwas not considered by the district court, and we agree with the\r\ndistrict court's conclusion that Lennon did not counter the\r\ndefendant's articulated reason by \"introduc[ing] sufficient\r\nevidence . . .

Lennon came forward with a memo\r\nfrom one M.J. Wilkins, an employee in the ATF Employee and Labor\r\nRelations Branch, stating that she was forwarding a package of\r\nmaterials relating to Lennon to the \"ATF EEO Task Force,\" a\r\ngroup that included individuals from outside the agency. \r\nHowever, Wilkins testified that she actually gave the package\r\nonly to Marjorie Kornegay, the ATF's Assistant Director for\r\nEqual Employment Opportunity Programs and a member of the Task\r\nForce, and Kornegay declared that she never gave the package to\r\nthe other Task Force members and that the Task Force never\r\nreviewed any material relating to Lennon.  See 5 U.S.C. \r\n552a(b)(1).  Lennon weakly responds that whether the file was\r\nactually reviewed by the Task Force \"is the question of fact\r\nthat the plaintiff wants decided by a fact finder, not an\r\naffidavit,\" and that the question \"cannot be decided by some\r\nsort of statement from Kornegay.\"  These arguments misapprehend\r\nLennon's burden at the summary judgment stage, where \"[b]rash\r\nconjecture, coupled with earnest hope that something concrete\r\nwill eventually materialize, is insufficient.\"  Dow v.

On issues where the nonmovant bears\r\nthe ultimate burden of proof, he must present definite,\r\ncompetent evidence to rebut the motion.\").  On the evidence\r\npresented, no reasonable factfinder could find that there was an\r\nimpermissible disclosure.\r\nFinally, our de novo review discloses no error in the\r\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment for the defendant on\r\nLennon's Privacy Act claim that the defendant intentionally or\r\nwillfully maintained illegal systems of records that had an\r\nadverse effect on him.  See 5 U.S.C.  552a(g)(1), (4).  We\r\npause only to note that the district court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in failing to strike Exhibits 14 and 15 to\r\ndefendant's statement of undisputed material facts, which\r\nconsisted of charts listing and describing each allegedly\r\nillegally maintained record and citing a source of authority for\r\nthe maintenance of each record.  Lennon contends that these\r\nexhibits were not authenticated and do not fall into the class\r\nof materials identified in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. \r\nHowever, since all but one of the records listed and described\r\nin the exhibits were separately reproduced elsewhere in\r\ndefendant's submission, and since the remainder of the exhibits\r\nconsists of citations to and quotations from legal authority,\r\nthe district court was entitled to consider the exhibits, which\r\nwere referenced in defendant's memoranda of law, as legal\r\nargument not subject to strictures on evidentiary submissions. \r\nWe have considered all of Lennon's properly presented\r\narguments and find them without merit.  Accordingly, the\r\njudgment of the district court is affirmed. \n</pre>",
