Petitioner  Clifford H. Tivey  appeals the\r                           \n\ndecision of the Railroad Retirement Board [the Board] that he\n\nwas  entitled  only to  a  retirement  annuity beginning  six\n\nmonths before the date of his application filed November  12,\n\n1986.   See 45 U.S.C.   231d(a) (iii) (limiting the beginning\r                       \n\nof an annuity to \"the first day of the sixth month before the\n\nmonth in which the application was filed\").  We affirm.\n\n     We have reviewed carefully the  record in this case  and\n\nthe briefs of the parties.  Essentially for the reasons given\n\nin the decision of the hearing officer, dated April 13, 1992,\n\nwe  find  that  substantial  evidence  supports  the  Board's\n\ndetermination that Tivey  did not file an  application for an\n\nannuity under  the Railroad Retirement Act  prior to November\n\n12, 1986.  See  Andrews v. Railroad Retirement Bd.,  595 F.2d\r                                                             \n\n676, 681 (D.C. Cir.  1978) (findings of Board must  be upheld\n\nif supported by substantial evidence).  \n\n     Moreover, even if we assume arguendo that Tivey did file\r                                                     \n\nan application for an  annuity in 1978,  we find no abuse  of\n\ndiscretion  in   the  Board's  refusal  to   reopen  in  this\n\ninstance.1   The record indicates that  subsequent to Tivey's\n\nfiling in 1978 and  his learning that the Board  had declared\n\nhim ineligible for an annuity, Tivey waited until 1990 before\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  We also assume arguendo that we have jurisdiction  over a\r                                       \nBoard's  refusal to reopen a case.  See Clifford v. U.S. R.R.\r                                                                         \nRetirement Bd., 3 F.3d 536, 538 (1st Cir. 1993) (assuming but\r                         \nnot deciding that the court has jurisdiction over the Board's\nrefusal to reopen a case)\r\r\n\nfiling documents which  supported his  claim of  eligibility.\n\nIn  the  absence   of  due  diligence  on  Tivey's   part  in\n\nprosecuting  his claim, we find no abuse of discretion in the\n\nBoard's  failure  to  reopen his  case  back  to  1978.
