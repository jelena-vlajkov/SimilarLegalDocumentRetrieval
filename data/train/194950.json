McConnell, Attorney,  Office of Immigration\n                               \nLitigation,  Civil Division, Department of  Justice, were on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n          BREYER, Chief  Judge.   The  Board of  Immigration\n                              \n\nAppeals has a general procedural rule that says it \"may  . .\n\n. reopen or reconsider any case  in which it has rendered  a\n\ndecision.\"   8 C.F.R.   3.2  (1993).  In a  series of cases,\n\nhowever,  the  Board  has  developed an  exception  to  this\n\nprocedural rule.  The exception relates to a certain kind of\n\nBoard  decision:   whether  or not  to grant  \"discretionary\n\nrelief\" which would permit an alien, otherwise \"deportable,\"\n\nnonetheless to remain in the United States.  Immigration and\n\nNationality  Act  (INA)      212(c),  8  U.S.C.     1182(c).\n\nAccording to  the procedural  exception, once the  Board has\n\ndenied   the   alien's   initial    \"discretionary   relief\"\n\napplication (and thus the Board has finally found the  alien\n\n\"deportable\"), the alien may not ask the Board to reopen his\n                                                        \n\ndeportation  proceedings for  further  consideration of  his\n\napplication.  See,  e.g., Matter of  Cerna, Int. Dec.  3161,\n                                          \n\nslip op. at 3-4 (BIA Oct. 7, 1991).\n\n          This  appeal requires  us  to  decide whether  the\n\nBoard's \"no reopening\" exception to its ordinary \"reopening\"\n\nrule is lawful.  The Third and Fifth Circuits have held that\n\nit is  lawful.  See  Katsis v. INS,  997 F.2d 1067  (3d Cir.\n                                  \n\n1993);  Ghassan v.

INS,\n                                                           \n\n979 F.2d 212,  213 (11th Cir.  1992) (table), aff'g  without\n                                                            \n\nopinion  Matter of Cerna, Int. Dec. 3161 (BIA Oct. 7, 1991).\n                        \n\nThe Second and Ninth Circuits have held that it is not.  See\n                                                            \n\nButros  v. INS,  990 F.2d  1142 (9th  Cir. 1993)  (en banc);\n              \n\nVargas v.  INS, 938 F.2d 358  (2d Cir. 1991).   We, like the\n              \n\nlatter two circuits, do not understand the basis for the \"no\n\nreopening\" exception.    In  our view,  the  Board  has  not\n\nproperly explained why it will consider motions to reopen in\n\nmost  cases   but  not   in  the  particular   circumstances\n\nillustrated  here.  We therefore hold that the Board may not\n\ninvoke this  exception as  grounds for refusing  to consider\n\nthe  petitioner's motion  to  reopen in  this  case, and  we\n\nremand the case  to the Board  for further consideration  of\n\nthat motion.\n\n                             I\n\n                    A.  Legal Background\n                                        \n\n          To understand the issue before us, the reader must\n\nkeep in mind the following legal background.  First, the INA\n\nlists a host of  grounds for excluding or  deporting aliens,\n\nincluding  conviction of a drug-related crime.  See, e.g., 8\n                                                         \n\nU.S.C.           1182(a)(2)    (exclusion),    1251(a)(2)(B)\n\n(deportation).   The Act also  says that a  certain class of\n\nthese \"deportable\" aliens  -- those who have  lived here for\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nseven years  as  aliens  \"lawfully  admitted  for  permanent\n\nresidence\" -- can ask the Attorney General (i.e., the Board,\n\nsee 8 U.S.C.    1103(a);  8 C.F.R.     3.0, 3.1(a),  (b)(3),\n   \n\n212.3(a)(2), (e)(3) (1993)) to  exercise a kind of equitable\n\ndiscretion that would permit them to remain here even though\n\nthey  have,  for example,  committed a  drug  crime.   INA  \n\n212(c), 8 U.S.C.   1182(c) (see Appendix for text).  The Act\n\ndefines the class of those eligible for this relief as those\n\nwho, for seven years, \n\n          hav[e]   been   lawfully  accorded   the\n          privilege of residing permanently in the\n          United   States   as  an   immigrant  in\n          accordance  with  the immigration  laws,\n          such status not having changed.\n                                        \n\n8 U.S.C.     1101(20) (emphasis  added) (defining  \"lawfully\n\nadmitted for permanent residence\").\n\n          Second,  an Immigration  Judge (IJ)  normally will\n\nmake  the initial decision as  to whether a particular alien\n\nis \"deportable,\"  8  C.F.R.    242.8(a) (1993),  and if  so,\n\nwhether  he   is  eligible  to  apply   for  section  212(c)\n\n\"discretionary relief.\"   Id.    212.3(a)(2), (e).   If  the\n                            \n\nalien is eligible, the IJ will further decide whether, given\n\nthe \"equities,\" the Attorney General will grant that relief.\n\nId.;  Matter of Marin, 16 I. &amp;  N. Dec. 581, 584 (BIA 1978);\n                     \n\nsee   generally  3   Charles  Gordon   &amp;   Stanley  Mailman,\n               \n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nImmigration Law and Procedure    74.01[2][a]-[b] (1993).  If\n\ndissatisfied  with the result,  the alien may  appeal to the\n\nBoard  of  Immigration  Appeals,   8  C.F.R.      3.1(b)(3),\n\n212.3(e)(3) (1993), which may  hold a hearing, take evidence\n\nand  decide the issues  de novo.   Hazzard v. INS,  951 F.2d\n                                                 \n\n435, 440 n.4 (1st Cir. 1991); Matter of Lok, 18 I. &amp; N. Dec.\n                                           \n\n101,   106  (BIA  1981);  1   Gordon  &amp;  Mailman,  supra,   \n                                                        \n\n3.05[5][b].  If the Board  reaches a negative decision,  the\n\nregulations (while phrased negatively, see infra pp. 9 - 10)\n                                                \n\nindicate that the alien normally may ask the Board either to\n\nreconsider its decision or to reopen the proceeding in light\n\nof  \"circumstances  which  have  arisen  subsequent  to  the\n\nhearing.\"  8  C.F.R.   3.2  (1993).  The  Supreme Court  has\n\npointed out that the  regulation governing motions to reopen\n\n\"does  not affirmatively  require  the Board  to reopen  the\n\nproceedings under any particular condition.\"  INS v. Jong Ha\n                                                            \n\nWang, 450 U.S. 139,  144 n.5 (1981) (per curiam).  The issue\n    \n\nbefore  us, however,  concerns  not whether  the Board  must\n\ngrant the motion, but whether it must consider it.\n                                              \n\n          Third,  despite these  regulations, the  Board has\n\nheld  in  a series  of cases  that  an alien,  resident here\n\nlawfully for seven years but under an administratively final\n\ndeportation  order,  may  not  ask the  Board  to  reopen  a\n                                  \n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nproceeding   ordering   deportation   to    obtain   further\n\nconsideration  of  \"discretionary   relief\"  under   section\n\n212(c).   The Board has  based these holdings  on the theory\n\nthat a final Board  decision ordering deportation means that\n\nthe  alien's \"status\"  has \"changed.\"   He  is therefore  no\n\nlonger  \"lawfully admitted for  permanent residence,\"  see 8\n                                                          \n\nU.S.C.   1101(20),  and thus falls  outside the category  of\n\nthose whom  section 212(c) permits to  ask for discretionary\n\nrelief.   And  since the  alien would  now be  ineligible to\n\napply for section 212(c) relief in  the first instance, see,\n                                                           \n\ne.g., Rivera  v. INS, 810 F.2d 540, 541 (5th Cir. 1987), the\n                    \n\nBoard  reasons that  he  also  may  not  move  to  reopen  a\n                                                         \n\npreviously  decided section 212(c)  application.  See, e.g.,\n                                                           \n\nKatsis, 997  F.2d at  1069; Butros, 990  F.2d at 1143.   The\n                                  \n\nBoard  does not, however, deny  the alien the  right to move\n\nfor   reconsideration  of   the   earlier   section   212(c)\n                     \n\napplication.  Cerna, slip op. at 5.\n                   \n\n                   B.  Factual Background\n                                         \n\n          The case before us involves a resident alien, Jose\n\nManuel Goncalves, who entered the United States as a baby in\n\n1968 and  who has lived  here ever since.   He has committed\n\nserious crimes, including  drug crimes.   In late 1989,  the\n\nINS began  deportation proceedings.  Goncalves conceded that\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nhe  was  deportable.    Goncalves then  asked  the  Attorney\n\nGeneral to exercise equitable  discretion in his favor under\n\nsection 212(c).  An IJ rejected this request on May 21, 1991\n\nand ordered him deported.  On January  8, 1992, the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals, after weighing the various equities for\n\nand  against  Goncalves,  also rejected  the  \"discretionary\n\nrelief\"  request   and  affirmed  the   IJ,  thus  rendering\n\nGoncalves'  deportation order  \"final.\"   8  C.F.R.    243.1\n\n(1993).   Goncalves  then  moved to  reopen the  deportation\n\nproceeding  so   that  he  could  present   letters  and  an\n\nemployment  record  that,  in  his  view,  amounted  to  new\n\nevidence  of  his rehabilitation  sufficient  to  change the\n\noutcome of the Board's \"discretionary\" calculus.\n\n          After a  series of proceedings  not here relevant,\n\nthe Board, on October  8, 1992, denied the motion  to reopen\n\non the sole ground that Goncalves, his \"status . . .  having\n\nchanged\" by virtue of  the Board's \"final\" deportation order\n\nof  January 8, 1992,  was no  longer \"lawfully  admitted for\n\npermanent residence\" and therefore \"[could]  not establish a\n\nprima facie case for relief.\"  The Board did not address the\n\nmerits  of his request to reopen.  Goncalves now appeals the\n\nBoard's denial  of his motion to reopen.  He argues that the\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nlaw requires the Board at least  to consider it.  We believe\n\nhe is correct.\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\n                             II\n\n                          Analysis\n                                  \n\n          The  Board's  refusal  to  allow  aliens  to  make\n\ncertain \"reopening\" motions is, in essence, a detail of  its\n\nprocedure.   In deciding the lawfulness of such a detail, we\n\nrecognize that  Congress  intended the  Attorney General  to\n\nhave  considerable   leeway  in  working   out  the  precise\n\nprocedures  for  determining  contested  issues  related  to\n\ndeportation  and   \"discretionary  relief.\"    8  U.S.C.    \n\n1103(a), 1182(c).   The  Attorney General has  delegated the\n\nauthority  to  work out  such procedures  to  the Board.   8\n\nU.S.C.   1103(a); 28 C.F.R.     0.115-0.117 (1991); 8 C.F.R.\n\n   3.0, 3.1(a), 3.1(d)(3) (1993).  We therefore must respect\n\nthe Board's judgment  in such  matters.  See,  e.g., FCC  v.\n                                                        \n\nPottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U.S. 134, 143 (1940); Union\n                                                            \n\nof Concerned  Scientists v.

The Administrative  Procedure  Act provides,\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nhowever, that the Board  may not act arbitrarily  or \"abuse\"\n\nits \"discretion.\"  5  U.S.C.   706(2)(A).  And,  even though\n\nwe  give  the  Board  considerable  leeway,  we  nonetheless\n\nconclude that it has acted arbitrarily in this instance.  We\n\nreach this conclusion for the following three reasons, taken\n\ntogether.\n\n          First, one of  the Board's procedural  regulations\n\nstrongly suggests that it will  permit motions to reopen  in\n                              \n\ncases of this sort.   The regulation first makes  clear that\n\n\"[t]he Board  may . .  . reopen  or reconsider  any case  in\n                                                   \n\nwhich it has rendered a decision\" (unless the motion is made\n\nafter the alien has left the United States).  8 C.F.R.   3.2\n\n(1993)  (emphasis  added).   The  regulation  then says  the\n\nfollowing:\n\n          Reopening or reconsideration of any case\n          in which a decision has been made by the\n          Board, whether  [or not] . . . requested\n          by the  party affected by  the decision,\n          shall be only upon written motion to the\n          Board.  Motions to reopen in deportation\n          proceedings shall not be  granted unless\n          it  appears to  the Board  that evidence\n          sought to be offered is material and was\n          not  available and  could not  have been\n          discovered  or  presented at  the former\n          hearing;  nor shall any motion to reopen\n          for the  purpose of affording  the alien\n          an opportunity to apply  for any form of\n          discretionary  relief  be granted  if it\n          appears that the  alien's right to apply\n          for  such relief was  fully explained to\n          him and an opportunity to apply therefor\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\n          was afforded him  at the former  hearing\n          unless the relief is sought on the basis\n          of   circumstances  which   have  arisen\n          subsequent to the hearing.  A  motion to\n          reopen . .  . shall not be made by . . .\n          a  person   who   is  the   subject   of\n          deportation  proceedings  subsequent  to\n          his departure from the United States.\n\nId.  We recognize that the regulation is phrased in negative\n   \n\nterms, which  means that  it does not  explicitly grant  any\n\nright  to  anyone  ever  to  ask  to  reopen  a  proceeding.\n\nNonetheless, consider the words\n\n          nor  shall any motion  to reopen for the\n          purpose  of  affording   the  alien   an\n          opportunity  to apply  for  any form  of\n          discretionary  relief be  granted .  . .\n          unless the relief is sought on the basis\n                                                  \n          of   circumstances  which   have  arisen\n                                                  \n          subsequent to the hearing.\n                                   \n\nId.  (emphasis added).   Coupled  with the  Board's explicit\n   \n\nauthority to reopen  any case, what  could those words  mean\n\nbut  that the alien does have  a right to move for reopening\n                        \n\nto  ask for  \"discretionary relief  . .  .  on the  basis of\n       \n\ncircumstances   which  have   arisen   subsequent   to   the\n\nrehearing\"?

The syllogism runs  approximately\n\nas follows:  \n\n          (1) The  INA allows section  212(c) \"discretionary\n          relief\" only upon the  request of a resident alien\n          whose \"status\" has not \"changed.\"  See 8 U.S.C.   \n                                                \n          1101(20), 1182(c); supra pp. 3 - 4.\n                                  \n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\n          (2)  The  INA does  not  say just  when,  during a\n          deportation proceeding, the alien's \"status  . . .\n          change[s].\"  \n\n          (3) The  Board thus has considerable  legal leeway\n          in interpreting  the statute with  respect to  the\n          precise  time  when  \"status  .  .  .  change[s].\"\n          Chevron  U.S.A.  v.

E.g.,  Nwolise\n                                                            \n          v.

The  law permits the Board to decide\n\n(within reason) when  a \"change of status\" takes  place, but\n\nit also permits the Board  to decide that moment differently\n                                                            \n\nfor  different purposes.

In Lok  (the source of the problem),  the Board\n                   \n\nconsidered a substantive question,  namely, whether or not a\n\nperson  ordered  deported after  less  than  seven years  of\n\nlawful residence  could continue to accrue  time towards the\n\nmagic  \"seven  years\"  while  his deportation  case  was  on\n\nappeal.  Lok, 18 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 102-05.  The Board sensibly\n            \n\nheld  that the \"seven  year\" clock stopped  ticking once the\n\nBoard  ordered  deportation.   It  found  that his  \"status\"\n\n\"changed\" at that moment  for the purpose of  accruing time.\n                                                           \n\nSee  Vargas, 938  F.2d at  361  (\"Matter of  Lok, therefore,\n                                                \n\nstands only for the proposition  that an alien cannot become\n                                                            \n\neligible for discretionary relief through subsequent accrual\n\nof  time  towards  the  seven-year threshold,  once  he  has\n\nconceded  that he is deportable.\"); Lok v.

After all,  the Board\n\nitself agrees  that the  alien remains eligible  to ask  for\n\nreconsideration.   8 C.F.R.    3.2 (1993); Matter  of Cerna,\n                                                           \n\nInt.  Dec. 3161,  slip op. at  5 (BIA  Oct. 7,  1991).  Even\n\nafter entry  of the  Board's \"final\" deportation  order, the\n     \n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\nalien can call to the Board's  attention evidence already in\n\nthe record  in an effort to show  that the Board's denial of\n\ndiscretionary  relief  is  unlawful  or to  convince  it  to\n\nexercise its  \"discretion\" differently.  Cerna,  slip op. at\n                                              \n\n5-6.   Moreover, the alien remains free to appeal the denial\n\nof discretionary relief  to the  courts.  The  entry of  the\n\nBoard's final order  does not \"change\" his \"status\" for this\n\npurpose  (if it did, it  would moot the  appeal by making it\n\nimpossible for the alien  to receive \"discretionary  relief\"\n\neven if he wins).   See Butros, 990 F.2d at 1145.  In short,\n                              \n\nLok's  substantive  conclusion may  or  may  not permit  the\n                                                       \n\nprocedural exception to the Board's reopening regulations at\n\nissue here, but it certainly does not require it.\n                                             \n\n          Either the  Board understands that  step (4)  does\n\nnot compel step (5) (i.e., that Lok and  other \"substantive\"\n                                   \n\nchange  of  status  precedents  do not  legally  compel  its\n                                                       \n\npresent position  on  motions to  reopen),  or it  does  not\n\nunderstand  that.  If  it does  not, then  it has  based its\n\nprocedural exception upon a legal misunderstanding, in which\n\ncase it must reconsider the matter.   See Camp v.

That\n   \n\nsyllogism --  based upon the substantive  \"change of status\"\n\nstatute, 8  U.S.C.   1101(20)  -- is irrelevant  because the\n\nBoard  does  not need  to refer  to  the \"change  of status\"\n\nstatute to  justify its procedural \"no  reopening\" exception\n\nif  that  exception  is  reasonable, and  reference  to  the\n                                   \n\nstatute cannot help the Board justify the exception if  that\n                                                            \n\nexception  is not  reasonable.   The basic  question is  the\n                              \n\nreasonableness of  the exception, not the  intricate maze of\n\nrelationships between  it and the substantive  statute.  And\n\nthe reasonableness  of the  exception seems  doubtful, given\n\nthe fact  that its finely-spun distinctions  (e.g., allowing\n\nreconsideration  but  not   reopening)  have  virtually   no\n\nexplanation apart from  those based on the syllogism.   See,\n                                                           \n\ne.g., Cerna, slip op. at 5-7.\n           \n\n          Third, we say  \"virtually\" because the  Board does\n\noffer one practical consideration in an effort to answer the\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\nquestion  \"why is the 'no reopening' exception reasonable?.\"\n                                                          \n\nIt says  that the  exception is reasonable  because it  will\n\nprevent aliens  from \"stringing out\" their  claims, i.e., by\n\nremoving  the  possibility  of  the  alien's  asking  for  a\n\nreopening, the exception also removes the alien's temptation\n\nto  withhold  some evidence  initially  in  order to  obtain\n\nreopening  after  an adverse  decision.    Some courts  have\n\naccepted this justification.  See, e.g., Katsis, 997 F.2d at\n                                               \n\n1072,  1074.   We cannot  do so,  however, both  because the\n\nBoard seems to  rely more  upon its  logical syllogism  than\n\nupon this  practical justification,  see, e.g.,  Cerna, slip\n                                                      \n\nop. at 3-7, and because the explanation itself raises fairly\n\nobvious questions that the Board has not yet answered.\n\n          Why,  for  example,  isn't  the   Board's  printed\n\nregulation  -- limiting  reopenings to  those sought  on the\n\n\"basis of  circumstances that have arisen  subsequent to the\n\nhearing,\"  see  supra  p.  10 --  sufficient  to  remove the\n                     \n\ntemptation to withhold evidence,  thus obviating the Board's\n\npractical  concern?   Why  is  the  \"stringing out\"  problem\n\ngreater  where \"discretionary  relief\" involving  seven year\n\nresident aliens is at issue than in other deportation cases?\n\nWhy  is the  \"stringing out\" problem  greater in  such cases\n\nthan where  other \"discretionary relief\" matters,  such as a\n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\nrequest for  suspension of  deportation under INA    244(a),\n\nare  at  issue?

Why  does the\n                       \n\nBoard  absolutely  forbid motions  to reopen  section 212(c)\n                 \n\ndiscretionary  relief applications?   Does it really believe\n\nthat circumstances could never  change enough, that even the\n                              \n\nmost heroic, public  spirited, self-sacrificing action  by a\n\nseven  year resident  alien, after  the  \"final\" deportation\n\norder, could not alter the outcome of the \"equity\" calculus?\n\nWe  do  not  say  that  no  satisfactory  answers  to  these\n\nquestions exist, but  we do say that the Board  seems not to\n\nhave asked them.\n\n          We  stress,  and  we  well  understand,  that  the\n\nexigencies of  the practical world  in which the  Board must\n\nwork  require that we  do not, and  we will not,  expect the\n\nBoard   to  answer   every  potentially   relevant  question\n\nregarding its  procedures.  Here, however,  the problem goes\n\nbeyond the fact  that the Board  has left obvious  questions\n\nunanswered.   More fundamentally, the Board  has not focused\n                                                            \n\ndirectly  on  the  basic  question of  whether  or  not  the\n        \n\nparticular  procedure before  us  is desirable,  nor has  it\n\nclearly  explained its  position.   Further, it  has instead\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\nunnecessarily  relied  on a  logical  syllogism involving  a\n\ntheoretical analysis of its own cases interpreting a statute\n\nof  only  marginal relevance  to  the  problem, rather  than\n\nsquarely  facing  the  practical  question  of  whether  the\n\nprocedural  exception is good or bad.  Finally, it has acted\n\nin the face  of a  regulation that seems  rather clearly  to\n\nauthorize the very kind of \"reopening\" motion that its cases\n\nthen deny.  Taking all these circumstances together, we find\n                                                   \n\nthe practice insufficiently justified.   That is to say,  we\n\nfind no legally  adequate explanation of  why the Board  has\n\ndeparted from  the rule set forth in its own regulation.  We\n\ntherefore  conclude  that the  Board's  departure  from that\n\nregulation is \"arbitrary,\" and we set it aside.  \n\n                            III\n\n                           Relief\n                                 \n\n          Having   set  aside  the  Board's  exception  that\n\nabsolutely  forbids   motions  to  reopen,  we   remand  for\n\nconsideration of the petitioner's motion to reopen his case.\n\nWe  shall  not decide  petitioner's  further  appeal of  the\n\nBoard's basic decision to deport him until the Board decides\n\nthe motion to reopen.  \n\n          We  also have  a suggestion.   The  circuit courts\n\nhave now split three to two  about the lawfulness of the \"no\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\nreopening\" exception.  Obviously,  the Board will be tempted\n\nto  ask  for Supreme  Court review.    There is,  however, a\n\nsimpler way.  Why  does the Board not consider  amending its\n\nprocedural regulations  to reach  the procedural  result for\n\nwhich it argues here?   Cf. Butros,  990 F.2d at 1144  (\"The\n                                  \n\nBoard could, no doubt, alter this regulation . . . .\"), 1146\n\n(Fernandez, J., concurring) (\"If the INS now wishes to adopt\n\ndifferent regulations, that route is available to it.\").  If\n\nits exception makes sense,  and it explains why that  is so,\n\nall  courts would respect the result.  If the exception does\n\nnot make sense, the Board  will not adopt it, and  that will\n\nbe  the end  of  the matter.   This  suggestion  is not,  of\n\ncourse, legally binding, and there may be sound reasons  not\n\nto follow it.   Yet it seems to us to  offer a fairly simple\n\nway  out of  what has  become something  of a  legal morass,\n\ninvolving five courts of appeals threading their way through\n\nminor procedural details of a highly complex subject.\n\n          The  petition in  No.  92-2272 for  review of  the\n\nBoard of  Immigration Appeals' decision is  granted, and the\n\ncase is  remanded  for further  proceedings consistent  with\n\nthis  opinion.  We do not  reach the issues presented in No.\n\n92-1122.\n\n          So ordered.\n                     \n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n\n                          APPENDIX\n                                  \n\nINA     212(c), 8  U.S.C.A.     1182(c)  (West Supp.  1993),\n\nprovides in pertinent part:\n\n               Aliens   lawfully   admitted    for\n          permanent resident [sic] who temporarily\n          proceeded  abroad  voluntarily  and  not\n          under an order  of deportation, and  who\n          are returning to a lawful unrelinquished\n          domicile of seven consecutive years, may\n          be  admitted  in the  discretion  of the\n          Attorney General without  regard to  the\n          provisions  of  subsection  (a) of  this\n          section (other than  paragraphs (3)  and\n          (9)(C)).\n\nAlthough on its face  this section applies only  to resident\n\naliens  who have temporarily left the United States and seek\n\nreadmission,  case  law  has  extended  its  application  to\n\nresident  aliens who have not  left the United  States.

The  Board of  Immigration\n                              \n\nAppeals has a general procedural rule that says it \"may  . .\n\n. reopen or reconsider any case  in which it has rendered  a\n\ndecision.\"   8 C.F.R.   3.2  (1993).  In a  series of cases,\n\nhowever,  the  Board  has  developed an  exception  to  this\n\nprocedural rule.  The exception relates to a certain kind of\n\nBoard  decision:   whether  or not  to grant  \"discretionary\n\nrelief\" which would permit an alien, otherwise \"deportable,\"\n\nnonetheless to remain in the United States.  Immigration and\n\nNationality  Act  (INA)      212(c),  8  U.S.C.     1182(c).\n\nAccording to  the procedural  exception, once the  Board has\n\ndenied   the   alien's   initial    \"discretionary   relief\"\n\napplication (and thus the Board has finally found the  alien\n\n\"deportable\"), the alien may not ask the Board to reopen his\n                                                        \n\ndeportation  proceedings for  further  consideration of  his\n\napplication.

We, like the\n              \n\nlatter two circuits, do not understand the basis for the \"no\n\nreopening\" exception.    In  our view,  the  Board  has  not\n\nproperly explained why it will consider motions to reopen in\n\nmost  cases   but  not   in  the  particular   circumstances\n\nillustrated  here.  We therefore hold that the Board may not\n\ninvoke this  exception as  grounds for refusing  to consider\n\nthe  petitioner's motion  to  reopen in  this  case, and  we\n\nremand the case  to the Board  for further consideration  of\n\nthat motion.\n\n                             I\n\n                    A.  Legal Background\n                                        \n\n          To understand the issue before us, the reader must\n\nkeep in mind the following legal background.  First, the INA\n\nlists a host of  grounds for excluding or  deporting aliens,\n\nincluding  conviction of a drug-related crime.  See, e.g., 8\n                                                         \n\nU.S.C.           1182(a)(2)    (exclusion),    1251(a)(2)(B)\n\n(deportation).   The Act also  says that a  certain class of\n\nthese \"deportable\" aliens  -- those who have  lived here for\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nseven years  as  aliens  \"lawfully  admitted  for  permanent\n\nresidence\" -- can ask the Attorney General (i.e., the Board,\n\nsee 8 U.S.C.    1103(a);  8 C.F.R.     3.0, 3.1(a),  (b)(3),\n   \n\n212.3(a)(2), (e)(3) (1993)) to  exercise a kind of equitable\n\ndiscretion that would permit them to remain here even though\n\nthey  have,  for example,  committed a  drug  crime.   INA  \n\n212(c), 8 U.S.C.   1182(c) (see Appendix for text).  The Act\n\ndefines the class of those eligible for this relief as those\n\nwho, for seven years, \n\n          hav[e]   been   lawfully  accorded   the\n          privilege of residing permanently in the\n          United   States   as  an   immigrant  in\n          accordance  with  the immigration  laws,\n          such status not having changed.\n                                        \n\n8 U.S.C.     1101(20) (emphasis  added) (defining  \"lawfully\n\nadmitted for permanent residence\").\n\n          Second,  an Immigration  Judge (IJ)  normally will\n\nmake  the initial decision as  to whether a particular alien\n\nis \"deportable,\"  8  C.F.R.    242.8(a) (1993),  and if  so,\n\nwhether  he   is  eligible  to  apply   for  section  212(c)\n\n\"discretionary relief.\"   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564781\"><a href=\"/opinion/564781/simon-b-vargas-v-immigration-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>    212.3(a)(2), (e). </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  If  the\n                            \n\nalien is eligible, the IJ will further decide whether, given\n\nthe \"equities,\" the Attorney General will grant that relief.\n\nId.;  Matter of Marin, 16 I. &amp;  N.

The Board has  based these holdings  on the theory\n\nthat a final Board  decision ordering deportation means that\n\nthe  alien's \"status\"  has \"changed.\"   He  is therefore  no\n\nlonger  \"lawfully admitted for  permanent residence,\"  see 8\n                                                          \n\nU.S.C.   1101(20),  and thus falls  outside the category  of\n\nthose whom  section 212(c) permits to  ask for discretionary\n\nrelief.   And  since the  alien would  now be  ineligible to\n\napply for section 212(c) relief in  the first instance, see,\n                                                           \n\ne.g., Rivera  v.

Factual Background\n                                         \n\n          The case before us involves a resident alien, Jose\n\nManuel Goncalves, who entered the United States as a baby in\n\n1968 and  who has lived  here ever since.   He has committed\n\nserious crimes, including  drug crimes.   In late 1989,  the\n\nINS began  deportation proceedings.  Goncalves conceded that\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nhe  was  deportable.    Goncalves then  asked  the  Attorney\n\nGeneral to exercise equitable  discretion in his favor under\n\nsection 212(c).  An IJ rejected this request on May 21, 1991\n\nand ordered him deported.  On January  8, 1992, the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals, after weighing the various equities for\n\nand  against  Goncalves,  also rejected  the  \"discretionary\n\nrelief\"  request   and  affirmed  the   IJ,  thus  rendering\n\nGoncalves'  deportation order  \"final.\"   8  C.F.R.    243.1\n\n(1993).   Goncalves  then  moved to  reopen the  deportation\n\nproceeding  so   that  he  could  present   letters  and  an\n\nemployment  record  that,  in  his  view,  amounted  to  new\n\nevidence  of  his rehabilitation  sufficient  to  change the\n\noutcome of the Board's \"discretionary\" calculus.\n\n          After a  series of proceedings  not here relevant,\n\nthe Board, on October  8, 1992, denied the motion  to reopen\n\non the sole ground that Goncalves, his \"status . . .  having\n\nchanged\" by virtue of  the Board's \"final\" deportation order\n\nof  January 8, 1992,  was no  longer \"lawfully  admitted for\n\npermanent residence\" and therefore \"[could]  not establish a\n\nprima facie case for relief.\"  The Board did not address the\n\nmerits  of his request to reopen.  Goncalves now appeals the\n\nBoard's denial  of his motion to reopen.  He argues that the\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nlaw requires the Board at least  to consider it.  We believe\n\nhe is correct.\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\n                             II\n\n                          Analysis\n                                  \n\n          The  Board's  refusal  to  allow  aliens  to  make\n\ncertain \"reopening\" motions is, in essence, a detail of  its\n\nprocedure.   In deciding the lawfulness of such a detail, we\n\nrecognize that  Congress  intended the  Attorney General  to\n\nhave  considerable   leeway  in  working   out  the  precise\n\nprocedures  for  determining  contested  issues  related  to\n\ndeportation  and   \"discretionary  relief.\"    8  U.S.C.    \n\n1103(a), 1182(c).   The  Attorney General has  delegated the\n\nauthority  to  work out  such procedures  to  the Board.   8\n\nU.S.C.   1103(a); 28 C.F.R.     0.115-0.117 (1991); 8 C.F.R.\n\n   3.0, 3.1(a), 3.1(d)(3) (1993).

And,  even though\n\nwe  give  the  Board  considerable  leeway,  we  nonetheless\n\nconclude that it has acted arbitrarily in this instance.  We\n\nreach this conclusion for the following three reasons, taken\n\ntogether.\n\n          First, one of  the Board's procedural  regulations\n\nstrongly suggests that it will  permit motions to reopen  in\n                              \n\ncases of this sort.   The regulation first makes  clear that\n\n\"[t]he Board  may . .  . reopen  or reconsider  any case  in\n                                                   \n\nwhich it has rendered a decision\" (unless the motion is made\n\nafter the alien has left the United States).  8 C.F.R.   3.2\n\n(1993)  (emphasis  added).   The  regulation  then says  the\n\nfollowing:\n\n          Reopening or reconsideration of any case\n          in which a decision has been made by the\n          Board, whether  [or not] . . . requested\n          by the  party affected by  the decision,\n          shall be only upon written motion to the\n          Board.  Motions to reopen in deportation\n          proceedings shall not be  granted unless\n          it  appears to  the Board  that evidence\n          sought to be offered is material and was\n          not  available and  could not  have been\n          discovered  or  presented at  the former\n          hearing;  nor shall any motion to reopen\n          for the  purpose of affording  the alien\n          an opportunity to apply  for any form of\n          discretionary  relief  be granted  if it\n          appears that the  alien's right to apply\n          for  such relief was  fully explained to\n          him and an opportunity to apply therefor\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\n          was afforded him  at the former  hearing\n          unless the relief is sought on the basis\n          of   circumstances  which   have  arisen\n          subsequent to the hearing.

That\n   \n\nsyllogism --  based upon the substantive  \"change of status\"\n\nstatute, 8  U.S.C.   1101(20)  -- is irrelevant  because the\n\nBoard  does  not need  to refer  to  the \"change  of status\"\n\nstatute to  justify its procedural \"no  reopening\" exception\n\nif  that  exception  is  reasonable, and  reference  to  the\n                                   \n\nstatute cannot help the Board justify the exception if  that\n                                                            \n\nexception  is not  reasonable.

Does it really believe\n\nthat circumstances could never  change enough, that even the\n                              \n\nmost heroic, public  spirited, self-sacrificing action  by a\n\nseven  year resident  alien, after  the  \"final\" deportation\n\norder, could not alter the outcome of the \"equity\" calculus?\n\nWe  do  not  say  that  no  satisfactory  answers  to  these\n\nquestions exist, but  we do say that the Board  seems not to\n\nhave asked them.\n\n          We  stress,  and  we  well  understand,  that  the\n\nexigencies of  the practical world  in which the  Board must\n\nwork  require that we  do not, and  we will not,  expect the\n\nBoard   to  answer   every  potentially   relevant  question\n\nregarding its  procedures.  Here, however,  the problem goes\n\nbeyond the fact  that the Board  has left obvious  questions\n\nunanswered.   More fundamentally, the Board  has not focused\n                                                            \n\ndirectly  on  the  basic  question of  whether  or  not  the\n        \n\nparticular  procedure before  us  is desirable,  nor has  it\n\nclearly  explained its  position.   Further, it  has instead\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\nunnecessarily  relied  on a  logical  syllogism involving  a\n\ntheoretical analysis of its own cases interpreting a statute\n\nof  only  marginal relevance  to  the  problem, rather  than\n\nsquarely  facing  the  practical  question  of  whether  the\n\nprocedural  exception is good or bad.  Finally, it has acted\n\nin the face  of a  regulation that seems  rather clearly  to\n\nauthorize the very kind of \"reopening\" motion that its cases\n\nthen deny.  Taking all these circumstances together, we find\n                                                   \n\nthe practice insufficiently justified.   That is to say,  we\n\nfind no legally  adequate explanation of  why the Board  has\n\ndeparted from  the rule set forth in its own regulation.  We\n\ntherefore  conclude  that the  Board's  departure  from that\n\nregulation is \"arbitrary,\" and we set it aside.  \n\n                            III\n\n                           Relief\n                                 \n\n          Having   set  aside  the  Board's  exception  that\n\nabsolutely  forbids   motions  to  reopen,  we   remand  for\n\nconsideration of the petitioner's motion to reopen his case.\n\nWe  shall  not decide  petitioner's  further  appeal of  the\n\nBoard's basic decision to deport him until the Board decides\n\nthe motion to reopen.  \n\n          We  also have  a suggestion.   The  circuit courts\n\nhave now split three to two  about the lawfulness of the \"no\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\nreopening\" exception.  Obviously,  the Board will be tempted\n\nto  ask  for Supreme  Court review.    There is,  however, a\n\nsimpler way.  Why  does the Board not consider  amending its\n\nprocedural regulations  to reach  the procedural  result for\n\nwhich it argues here?
