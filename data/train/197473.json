July 22,  1997) (per curiam), we retained  jurisdiction\r\n\nand remanded for a more detailed explanation of the basis for the\r\n\nmonetary sanction.    In response,  the  district court  filed  a\r\n\nReport dated August 25, 1997.  In the  Report, the district court\r\n\nidentified  two purposes underlying  the monetary sanction:   \"to\r\n\nreimburse the taxpayers for the abuse of the judicial system\" and\r\n\n\"to  deter Mr.  Prevett from  further  abuse.\"   Prevett filed  a\r\n\nsupplemental   memorandum   challenging  the   district   court's\r\n\nreasoning and findings in various respects.\r\n\n          We do not dwell on the merits other than to say that we\r\n\ncredit the findings  contained in the Report and  conclude that a\r\n\nmonetary  sanction  is  appropriate to  deter  repetition  of the\r\n\nconduct which the  district court found to be  unacceptable.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nsupra note 1.  We turn, then, to the size of the sanction.\r               \r\n\n          Appellate review of the size  of a monetary sanction is\r\n\nfor  abuse of  discretion.   In that  regard, \"When  the district\r\n\ncourt settles upon a monetary sanction and fixes a dollar amount,\r\n\na  reviewing tribunal should  defer, within broad  limits, to the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The district court apparently imposed the sanction pursuant\r\nto Fed.  R.  Civ. P.  16(f).   The incident  giving  rise to  the\r\nsanction  occurred  when the  attorney  failed  to  appear for  a\r\nscheduled bench  trial (without  any satisfactory  excuse).   The\r\ncourt  sanctioned him  as  a condition  of  vacating the  ensuing\r\ndismissal.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\ndistrict   court's   exercise   of   its   informed   discretion.\r\n\nNevertheless, the court of appeals  must be careful not merely to\r\n\n`rubber-stamp  the decisions of  the district court.'   Appellate\r\n\nreview of the appropriateness of  a sanction cannot be allowed to\r\n\ndeteriorate  into a perfunctory ritual.\"  Navarro-Ayala v. Nunez,\r                                                                          \r\n\n968 F.2d 1421, 1426 (1st Cir. 1992) (citation omitted).\r\n\n          A monetary penalty  payable to the court is  a suitable\r\n\nsanction  for a  Rule 16(f)  violation that  interferes with  the\r\n\ncourt's  management of  its docket.   See Jones  v. Winnepesaukee\r                                                                           \r\n\nRealty, 990  F.2d 1,  5 (1st Cir.  1993).   Still, we  think that\r                \r\n\nPrevett raises a valid question as to the amount of the impost in\r\n\nthis instance.\r\n\n          In   assessing  the   reasonableness  of   a  sanction,\r\n\n\"proportionality is often a proxy for appropriateness.\"  Navarro-\r                                                                           \r\n\nAyala, 968 F.2d at 1427.  In  such purlieus, it is important that\r               \r\n\n\"the  punishment should  be  reasonably  suited  to  the  crime.\"\r\n\nAnderson  v. Beatrice  Foods Co.,  900  F.2d 388,  395 (1st  Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1990).  With  due respect for  the district court's  considerable\r\n\ndiscretion, we find the imposition of a $5,250  fine in this case\r\n\nto be  substantially disproportionate and,  therefore, excessive.\r\n\nWe explain briefly.\r\n\n          We  believe   that  we   must  evaluate  the   sanction\r\n\nprincipally from  the standpoint of  deterrence.2  It  is settled\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2While  a  district  court  may  sometimes  tie  a  monetary\r\nsanction  to  specific   non-court  costs  that  bear   a  direct\r\nrelationship  to sanctionable  misconduct,  see,  e.g.,  Eash  v.\r                                                                       \r\nRiggins  Trucking, Inc.,  757 F.2d  557, 560  (3d Cir.  1985) (en\r                                 \r\nbanc), the  district court  here used an  approach to  such costs\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nthat a \"monetary sanction aimed at deterrence is appropriate only\r\n\nwhen the  amount of the  sanction falls within the  minimum range\r\n\nreasonably required  to deter  the abusive  behavior.\"   Navarro-\r                                                                           \r\n\nAyala, 968 F.2d at 1427; accord In re Kunstler, 914 F.2d 505, 523\r                                                        \r\n\n(4th Cir. 1990).  Here, given Prevett's representations about the\r\n\nextent of his law practice, there is  no reason to believe that a\r\n\nsum somewhat smaller  than $5,250 would not be  a fully effective\r\n\ndeterrent.    As  in  Navarro-Ayala,  \"[t]he  violation  deserved\r                                             \r\n\npunishment,  but  the   sting  of  the   lash  could  have   been\r\n\ncommunicated  emphatically through a  more modest penalty.\"   968\r\n\nF.2d at 1428.\r\n\n          Where,  as here,  a  monetary  sanction,  viewed  as  a\r\n\nvehicle for  deterrence against the  backdrop of the record  as a\r\n\nwhole, is excessive  in amount, we have a choice of anodynes.  We\r\n\nmay, of course,  remand to permit the district  court to refigure\r\n\nthe amount of the sanction, but we  are not constrained to follow\r\n\nsuch a course.   See id. (citing  Coats v. Pierre, 890  F.2d 728,\r                                                           \r\n\n734 (5th Cir.  1989), and Cheek  v. Doe, 828  F.2d 395, 398  (7th\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1987) (per curiam)).  In this instance, the record on appeal\r\n\nis reasonably  complete and too  much judicial  time has  already\r\n\nbeen spent on counsel's regrettable lapse.  Accordingly, this may\r\n\nproperly be  classified as  a case in  which an  appellate court,\r\n\nrather than remanding,  ought simply to recast the  amount of the\r\n\nsanction.  Believing, as we do,  that an amount of $1,000 \"stands\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nthat  we  find problematic.    We  therefore concentrate  on  the\r\ndistrict court's alternative ground:  deterrence.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nat the  outer periphery of  permissible sanctions in  this case,\"\r\n\nNavarro-Ayala,  968 F.2d  at 1428,  we reduce  the amount  of the\r                       \r\n\nsanction from $5,250 to $1,000.\r\n\n          We need go  no further.3  We affirm the imposition of a\r\n\nmonetary sanction payable to the  court, but reduce the amount of\r\n\nthe sanction to $1,000.\r\n\n          Affirmed as modified.  No costs.\r                    Affirmed as modified.  No costs.\r                                                    \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3Prevett's   request   for  rescission   of   the  so-called\r\n\"answering  service\" sanction is moot because that requirement is\r\nno longer in effect.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n",
