BACKGROUND\r\n\n          On  April  17,  1991,  nine  law  enforcement  officers\r\n\nconverged  upon   an  apartment   located  at  82   Glenham  St.,\r\n\nProvidence, Rhode  Island, to execute a search  warrant.  Inside,\r\n\nthey  found three  individuals:   the appellant,  his grandmother\r\n\n(who  leased the  apartment),  and Rafael  Tavarez.   The  police\r\n\nimmediately  segregated the  trio  in different  chambers.   They\r\n\nplaced the appellant  in the  kitchen under the  watchful eye  of\r\n\nDetective Michael Panzarella.   The search team then started  its\r\n\ntreasure hunt.\r\n\n          In short order,  a narcotics detective, Guy  DeAngelis,\r\n\ndiscovered a  plastic bag  secreted between  the cushions  of the\r\n\nliving  room couch.  Inside  the bag were  forty-seven cut straws\r\n\nwith  the ends burned shut.  Subsequent tests confirmed that each\r\n\nstraw  contained  cocaine  base, known  colloquially  as \"crack.\"\r\n\nAnother gendarme, Robert Clements, spied two firearms under a day\r\n\nbed in the  dining room.  A third  officer, John Corley, rummaged\r\n\nthrough  the rear hall closet and found a plastic bag, containing\r\n\nan additional 101 crack-filled  straws, in the pocket of  a green\r\n\njacket.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n          Promptly   upon  the   discovery  of   the  contraband,\r\n\nPanzarella  read  the  appellant  his rights.    See  Miranda  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nArizona,  384  U.S.  436,  479  (1966).    Meanwhile, the  search\r                 \r\n\ncontinued.  DeAngelis  proceeded to examine  the contents of  the\r\n\nrear hall  closet, poring over  items of  apparel one by  one and\r\n\ndropping  each  piece  on the  floor  when  he  had finished  his\r\n\ninspection of it.  The appellant (who enjoyed a clear view of the\r\n\ncloset from  the kitchen)  harangued DeAngelis not  to throw  his\r\n\nclothing  on the  floor as  he  might want  to wear  it upon  his\r\n\nrelease.  When DeAngelis asked the appellant whether he owned the\r\n\nclothes, the  appellant responded affirmatively.   In reply  to a\r\n\nspecific inquiry, the appellant identified the crack-laden  green\r\n\njacket as belonging to  him.  Later on, DeAngelis  descended into\r\n\nthe  basement   an  area to which  all occupants  of the building\r\n\nenjoyed  common access   and came across a triple-beam scale of a\r\n\ntype commonly associated with the packaging  of illegal drugs for\r\n\nretail distribution.\r\n\n          Near the end of the  search, Corley asked the appellant\r\n\nwhere he  slept.  The  appellant pointed  toward the day  bed and\r\n\nsaid \"there.\"  To put the ribbon on the package, Sergeant Stephen\r\n\nBathgate  (the  officer  in  charge of  the  operation)  elicited\r\n\nincriminating comments from the appellant in the course of making\r\n\nthe formal arrest.\r\n\n          The  police  transported the  appellant to  the station\r\n\nhouse.   After  again receiving  Miranda warnings,  the appellant\r                                                  \r\n\nsigned a form  that signified his understanding of  those rights.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nHe then called a friend and asked her to contact his attorney.\r\n\nII.  PROCEEDINGS BELOW\r          II.  PROCEEDINGS BELOW\r\n\n            In  due course,  a federal  grand jury  handed  up an\r\n\nindictment.  The appellant  responded in part by filing  a motion\r\n\nto  suppress the statements he had  made to the police during the\r\n\nsearch.  He  advanced two  arguments.  First,  he insisted  that,\r\n\nwhile still  at Glenham St., he  had invoked his right  to remain\r\n\nsilent and  asked if he could contact  his attorney, but that the\r\n\npolice ignored his importuning and did  not permit him to do  so.\r\n\nSecond, he  contended that DeAngelis  had dumped the  clothing on\r\n\nthe  floor  in a  wily  effort  to  provoke him  into  making  an\r\n\ninculpatory  comment, and  that,  therefore,  DeAngelis's  antics\r\n\nshould be treated as an impermissible constructive interrogation.\r\n\nSee Rhode  Island  v.  Innis, 446  U.S.  291, 301  (1980).    The\r                                      \r\n\ngovernment denied that the appellant invoked  his right to remain\r\n\nsilent or that he sought counsel while at the apartment.  It also\r\n\nargued that his initial complaint  concerning the handling of his\r\n\nvestments was  a spontaneous  utterance, and that  his subsequent\r\n\nstatements amounted to a waiver of his Miranda rights.\r                                                        \r\n\n          Following  an evidentiary  hearing, the  district court\r\n\nruled that DeAngelis's rearrangement  of the appellant's wardrobe\r\n\ndid not  amount  to an  interrogation, and  that the  appellant's\r\n\noriginal  objection  to DeAngelis's  behavior  could  properly be\r\n\nadmitted into evidence as a spontaneous statement.  Sweeping more\r\n\nbroadly, the court found  as a matter of fact  that the appellant\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nhad neither invoked  his rights nor  requested an attorney  while\r\n\nthe  search was  ongoing.   Consequently, the  court ruled  that,\r\n\ngiven  the  adequate  warnings  which   proceeded  the  officers'\r\n\nquestions, the appellant's replies could be used against him.\r\n\n          At trial,  the appellant did not  seriously dispute his\r\n\npossession of  crack cocaine, but, rather,  concentrated his fire\r\n\non  the issue of distributive  intent.  Some  of the government's\r\n\nproof  on  this  point came  in  the  form  of opinion  testimony\r\n\nrendered  by  DeAngelis.    In  the  end,  the  jury  bought  the\r\n\nprosecution's wares  and convicted the appellant  on both counts.\r\n\nThe district court  sentenced him to serve  sixty-three months in\r\n\nprison on  the drug trafficking  charge, and added  a consecutive\r\n\nsixty-month  incarcerative term for the  firearms count.  After a\r\n\nfalse start, the  details of  which are not  relevant here,  this\r\n\nappeal blossomed.\r\n\nIII.  THE DRUG TRAFFICKING CONVICTION\r          III.  THE DRUG TRAFFICKING CONVICTION\r\n\n          We begin by analyzing  the assignments of error insofar\r\n\nas  they relate to the conviction for possession of crack cocaine\r\n\nwith  intent to distribute.  The appellant assigns error in three\r\n\nrespects.  We treat these claims seriatim.\r                                                   \r\n\n                  A.  Suppression of Statements.\r                            A.  Suppression of Statements.\r                                                         \r\n\n          Before us,  the appellant assails the  district court's\r\n\nrefusal to  suppress his  statements regarding the  clothing, the\r\n\nday bed, and the like.  His main thesis is that he exercised  his\r\n\nprerogative to remain silent  and demanded an attorney,  but that\r\n\nthe  police rode roughshod over his rights.  He asseverates that,\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nunder  these circumstances,  the interrogation  conducted by  the\r\n\nofficers at  the search scene  contravened the teachings  of both\r\n\nMiranda and  Edwards  v.  Arizona,  451 U.S  477,  484-85  (1981)\r                                           \r\n\n(explaining  that an accused, having voiced a desire to deal with\r\n\nthe authorities  only with the aid of a lawyer, is not subject to\r\n\nfurther  police  interrogation   until  counsel  has   been  made\r\n\navailable to him).1  We find no error.\r\n\n          In reviewing  orders  granting or  denying  suppression\r\n\nmotions,  this  court  scrutinizes  a  district  court's  factual\r\n\nfindings, including its credibility determinations, for traces of\r\n\nclear error.   See United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st\r                                                    \r\n\nCir. 1994).  By contrast, we indulge plenary review of the  lower\r\n\ncourt's  answers  to questions  of  law,  including its  ultimate\r\n\nresolution of the constitutional issue.  See id.\r                                                          \r\n\n          In this case, whether or not to suppress the challenged\r\n\nstatements  boils down  to a  credibility call.   Such  calls are\r\n\ngrist for the district court's mill.  See, e.g., United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nRutkowski,  877  F.2d 139,  144 (1st  Cir.  1989).   The district\r                   \r\n\ncourt, having seen and  heard the witnesses at first  hand, chose\r\n\nto  believe  the  mustered  testimony  of  four  law  enforcement\r\n\nofficers    Bathgate, DeAngelis,  Panzarella, and Corley  (two of\r\n\nwhom  testified  unequivocally  that the  appellant  had  neither\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Except for his  contention that he  invoked certain of  his\r\nrights  prior to  questioning, the  appellant has  not maintained\r\nthat his  responses to  police queries represented  anything less\r\nthan a knowing and intelligent waiver of his Miranda rights.  Any\r                                                              \r\nsuch argument  is,  therefore,  waived.   See  United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1,  17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,  494 U.S. 1082\r                                                           \r\n(1990).\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nexpressed  a desire to stay  silent nor requested  counsel)   and\r\n\nrejected the appellant's contradictory version of his interaction\r\n\nwith  the  police.    If  we  are  to   remain  faithful  to  the\r\n\njurisprudence of  clear error,  we cannot disturb  this finding.2\r\n\nSee id. (acknowledging that  a judge's credibility choice between\r                 \r\n\ntwo plausible accounts of the events in question cannot be deemed\r\n\nclearly erroneous);  see also  Cumpiano v. Banco  Santander P.R.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n902 F.2d 148,  152 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that  there can be\r\n\nno clear error \"unless, on the whole of the record, [the court of\r\n\nappeals] form[s]  a strong, unyielding belief that  a mistake has\r\n\nbeen made\").\r\n\n               B.  Admission of Opinion Testimony.\r                         B.  Admission of Opinion Testimony.\r                                                           \r\n\n          At trial, DeAngelis,  after chronicling his  experience\r\n\nas a  narcotics detective  and his encyclopedic  familiarity with\r\n\nthe mores of  the crack  cocaine community, testified  as to  the\r\n\napproximate \"street value\" (all told, roughly  $1,500) of the 148\r\n\nstraws of crack found during the search.  He  also explained that\r\n\nso  large a quantity of crack was consistent with distribution as\r\n\nopposed  to  personal  use.    Finally,  he  listed  the  visible\r\n\ncharacteristics of the prototypical  crack addict, and noted that\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Since  we  uphold  the   lower  court's  finding  that  the\r\nappellant  did not  assert his  rights, but,  rather, voluntarily\r\nelected to answer the officers' questions, we need not assess the\r\ncorrectness of  the court's holding that  the appellant's initial\r\nstatement comprised  a spontaneous  utterance, not a  response to\r\nconstructive interrogation.  Though the detective's special brand\r\nof   valet  service   was   heavy-handed   (both  literally   and\r\nfiguratively),  there  is no  basis  on  the  present record  for\r\nsuppression of the appellant's retort.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nthe appellant manifested none of these symptoms.3\r\n\n          The appellant labors to convince us that this testimony\r\n\nshould not have been admitted for two reasons:  first, it did not\r\n\nafford the jury appropriate assistance in determining his intent;\r\n\nand second, it comprised  an impermissible opinion concerning his\r\n\nsupposed mental state.  We are not persuaded.\r\n\n          1.    Rule 702.  Under the  Federal Rules  of Evidence,\r                    1.    Rule 702.\r                                  \r\n\nexpert testimony  is admissible  if the witness  qualifies as  an\r\n\nexpert and the proffered testimony \"will assist the trier of fact\r\n\nto  understand the  evidence or  to determine  a fact  in issue.\"\r\n\nFed.  R.  Evid. 702.    The decision  to admit  or  reject expert\r\n\ntestimony is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court\r\n\nand  the court's determinations are  reviewable only for abuse of\r\n\nthat discretion.  See  United States v. Echeverri, 982  F.2d 675,\r                                                           \r\n\n680 (1st Cir.  1993); United  States v. Hoffman,  832 F.2d  1299,\r                                                         \r\n\n1310 (1st Cir.  1987).   Typically, appellate  courts give  trial\r\n\njudges  a wide berth in  respect to these  kinds of discretionary\r\n\njudgments.  See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 680.\r                                   \r\n\n          Viewed through this lens, the district court's decision\r\n\nto admit  DeAngelis's testimony  appears to be  properly focused.\r\n\nDeAngelis's  qualifications as  an  expert  were  not  challenged\r\n\neither below or in  the appellant's brief, and we  readily accept\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3DeAngelis's  testimony assisted  the  appellant in  certain\r\nparticulars.  For example,  he admitted on cross-examination that\r\nmany of the tools of the drug trafficking trade were not found in\r\nthe apartment,  and that no direct  evidence (e.g., fingerprints)\r\nlinked  the appellant to the scale that the authorities unearthed\r\nin the basement.\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nthem  as  sufficient.4    Turning  to  the  testimony,  DeAngelis\r\n\nexplained  the amount  of crack  that users  normally carry,  the\r\n\neffects  of an  individual dose,  and the  price of  each packet.\r\n\nMatters involving dosages, prices, and other  particulars endemic\r\n\nto the ingestion and distribution of crack cocaine are beyond the\r\n\nken of  the average  juror.   Consequently,  expert testimony  on\r\n\nthese  subjects is  likely  to  help  the  jury  and,  hence,  if\r\n\nsanctioned  by the trial judge,  is admissible in  evidence.

But  as  we  have\r\nrecognized before,  street  savvy and  practical  experience  can\r\nqualify a witness as an expert as surely as \"a string of academic\r\ndegrees or multiple memberships  in learned societies.\"  Hoffman,\r                                                                          \r\n832 F.2d at 1310.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nOn this record, there is no principled way for us to second-guess\r\n\nthat ruling.    Nor will  we strain  to  do so:   we  think  that\r\n\nDeAngelis's  testimony was  likely  welcomed by  the jurors,  who\r\n\notherwise might not  have understood the  significance of such  a\r\n\nlarge number of crack-filled straws.  Seen from this perspective,\r\n\nthe  testimony  provided  a   factual  predicate  for  the  jury,\r\n\npresumably  inexperienced in  the  customs of  the crack  cocaine\r\n\ncommunity,  to draw  the inference  that the  appellant possessed\r\n\ncocaine base for the purpose of retail distribution.\r\n\n          2.

It emerged in\r\n\n1984  as  an offshoot  of  Congress's retooling  of  the insanity\r\n\ndefense.  See S. Rep.

To this end, the Senate Report stated:\r\n\n          [T]he   rationale  for   precluding  ultimate\r\n          opinion psychiatric  testimony extends beyond\r\n          the insanity defense  to any ultimate  mental\r\n          state of  the defendant  that is  relevant to\r\n          the legal  conclusion  sought to  be  proven.\r\n          The  Committee has  fashioned  its  Rule  704\r\n          provision  to  reach   all  such   \"ultimate\"\r\n          issues,  e.g.,  premeditation  in a  homicide\r                                 \r\n          case,   or   lack   of    predisposition   in\r\n          entrapment.\r\n\nId. at 3413.  Thus, both the letter of Rule 704(b) and the spirit\r             \r\n\nthat animates  it preclude  psychiatrists or other  mental health\r\n\nprofessionals  from  testifying directly  to  a  mental state  or\r\n\ncondition that constitutes an element of  the crime charged (such\r\n\nas  a  criminal  defendant's  intent).

Instead,  DeAngelis   merely  explained  that  the\r\n\nquantity  of crack found at  the search site  was consistent with\r\n\ndistribution, as opposed to personal  use.  Because this evidence\r\n\ndoes no more than supply suggested predicate facts,  allowing the\r\n\njury to draw its own conclusions as to intent from those facts if\r\n\nit chooses to credit  the testimony, it does not  transgress Rule\r\n\n704(b).

Here, these elements were\r                       \r\n\namply proven.\r\n\n          The  discovery of  sizable quantities  of crack  at the\r\n\nappellant's place of abode  and in his jacket, together  with the\r\n\nappellant's admissions to the authorities, form a sturdy platform\r\n\non which to load a  finding of guilt.  The opinion  evidence that\r\n\nwe have  recounted furnishes additional support  for the finding.\r\n\nIt is clear to  us that a rational jury, impartially assaying all\r\n\nthe evidence, could  have found  beyond a reasonable  doubt    as\r\n\nthis  jury did   that the prosecution had successfully proved the\r\n\nessential elements of the drug trafficking charge.7\r\n\nIV.

Here,  unlike  in\r                      \r\nBoissoneault,   there  is  sufficient  corroborative  evidence   \r                      \r\nincluding but  not limited to  the admissions, the  firearms, and\r\nthe  sheer quantity of drugs   to reinforce the opinion testimony\r\nand support a guilty verdict.\r\n\n     8The statute of conviction provides in pertinent part:\r\n\n          Whoever, during and in relation to any .  . .\r\n          drug trafficking crime . . . for which he may\r\n          be  prosecuted  in  a  court  of  the  United\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nconviction,  asserting  that  the  evidence  is  insufficient  to\r\n\nsustain the verdict.\r\n\n          While  this case  was  pending on  appeal, the  Supreme\r\n\nCourt  decided Bailey v. United  States, 64 U.S.L.W. 4039 (1995).\r                                                 \r\n\nThe Bailey Court concluded  that, in order to convict  an accused\r                    \r\n\nfor \"use\" of a  firearm under section 924(c)(1), \"the  Government\r\n\nmust show active employment of the firearm.\"  Id. at 4041.  Thus,\r                                                           \r\n\n\"liability  attaches only to cases  of actual use\"  of a firearm,\r\n\nid. at  4042, a standard that  \"includes brandishing, displaying,\r             \r\n\nbartering,  striking  with,   and  most   obviously,  firing   or\r\n\nattempting to fire, a firearm.\"  Id.\r                                              \r\n\n          This  construction  of  the  \"use\"  prong  of   section\r\n\n924(c)(1)  resolved a split in  the circuits, see  id. at 4040-41\r                                                                \r\n\n(citing  representative cases),  and, in  the  bargain, abrogated\r\n\nearlier decisions of this court that permitted conviction under a\r\n\nmore  inclusive definition of \"use.\"  See, e.g., United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMcFadden, 13 F.3d 463, 465 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that evidence\r                  \r\n\nof the presence of a gun under a mattress, with cash, near drugs,\r\n\nsufficed  to  show \"use\").    Consequently,  we acknowledge  that\r\n\nMcFadden and its siblings are no longer good law.\r                  \r\n\n          Bailey is  directly on point  here.  At  oral argument,\r                          \r\n\nthe  government  confessed  error, candidly  admitting  that  its\r\n\nevidence  was  insufficient  to   show  \"use\"  under  the  Bailey\r                                                                           \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n          States, uses or carries  a firearm, shall . .\r\n          . be [subjected to additional punishment].\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   924(c)(1) (1988 &amp; Supp. II 1990).\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nstandard.  Because our  assessment of the record conduces  to the\r\n\nsame conclusion,  we reverse the appellant's  conviction under 18\r\n\nU.S.C.   924(c) and  direct the district court to  enter judgment\r\n\nin Valle's favor on that count.9\r\n\nV.  CONCLUSION\r          V.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          To recapitulate,  we affirm the  appellant's conviction\r\n\non  the drug trafficking charge and reverse his conviction on the\r\n\nfirearms charge.  Since it is conceivable that our disposition of\r\n\nthe latter count  might affect the sentencing  calculus in regard\r\n\nto  the former count, we honor counsels' joint request and remand\r\n\nto  the  district  court  for  possible  reconsideration  of  the\r\n\nsentence  originally imposed on the drug  trafficking count.

We affirm the drug trafficking conviction but reverse the firearms conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 17, 1991, nine law enforcement officers converged upon an apartment located at 82 Glenham St., Providence, Rhode Island, to execute a search warrant.  Inside, they found three individuals:  the appellant, his grandmother (who leased the apartment), and Rafael Tavarez.  The police immediately segregated the trio in different chambers.  They placed the appellant in the kitchen under the watchful eye of Detective Michael Panzarella.  The search team then started its treasure hunt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short order, a narcotics detective, Guy DeAngelis, discovered a plastic bag secreted between the cushions of the living room couch.  Inside the bag were forty-seven cut straws with the ends burned shut.  Subsequent tests confirmed that each straw contained cocaine base, known colloquially as \"crack.\"   Another gendarme, Robert Clements, spied two firearms under a day bed in the dining room.  A third officer, John Corley, rummaged through the rear hall closet and found a plastic bag, containing an additional 101 crack-filled straws, in the pocket of a green jacket.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Promptly upon the discovery of the contraband, Panzarella read the appellant his rights.  See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).  Meanwhile, the search continued.  DeAngelis proceeded to examine the contents of the rear hall closet, poring over items of apparel one by one and dropping each piece on the floor when he had finished his inspection of it.  The appellant (who enjoyed a clear view of the closet from the kitchen) harangued DeAngelis not to throw his clothing on the floor as he might want to wear it upon his release.  When DeAngelis asked the appellant whether he owned the clothes, the appellant responded affirmatively.  In reply to a specific inquiry, the appellant identified the crack-laden green jacket as belonging to him.  Later on, DeAngelis descended into the basement--an area to which all occupants of the building enjoyed common access--and came across a triple-beam scale of a type commonly associated with the packaging of illegal drugs for retail distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Near the end of the search, Corley asked the appellant where he slept.  The appellant pointed toward the day bed and said \"there.\"   To put the ribbon on the package, Sergeant Stephen Bathgate (the officer in charge of the operation) elicited incriminating comments from the appellant in the course of making the formal arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police transported the appellant to the station house.  After again receiving Miranda warnings, the appellant signed a form that signified his understanding of those rights.  He then called a friend and asked her to contact his attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, a federal grand jury handed up an indictment.  The appellant responded in part by filing a motion to suppress the statements he had made to the police during the search.  He advanced two arguments.  First, he insisted that, while still at Glenham St., he had invoked his right to remain silent and asked if he could contact his attorney, but that the police ignored his importuning and did not permit him to do so.  Second, he contended that DeAngelis had dumped the clothing on the floor in a wily effort to provoke him into making an inculpatory comment, and that, therefore, DeAngelis's antics should be treated as an impermissible constructive interrogation.  See Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1690, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980).  The government denied that the appellant invoked his right to remain silent or that he sought counsel while at the apartment.  It also argued that his initial complaint concerning the handling of his vestments was a spontaneous utterance, and that his subsequent statements amounted to a waiver of his Miranda rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following an evidentiary hearing, the district court ruled that DeAngelis's rearrangement of the appellant's wardrobe did not amount to an interrogation, and that the appellant's original objection to DeAngelis's behavior could properly be admitted into evidence as a spontaneous statement.  Sweeping more broadly, the court found as a matter of fact that the appellant had neither invoked his rights nor requested an attorney while the search was ongoing.  Consequently, the court ruled that, given the adequate warnings which preceded the officers' questions, the appellant's replies could be used against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the appellant did not seriously dispute his possession of crack cocaine, but, rather, concentrated his fire on the issue of distributive intent.  Some of the government's proof on this point came in the form of opinion testimony rendered by DeAngelis.  In the end, the jury bought the prosecution's wares and convicted the appellant on both counts.  The district court sentenced him to serve sixty-three months in prison on the drug trafficking charge, and added a consecutive sixty-month incarcerative term for the firearms count.  After a false start, the details of which are not relevant here, this appeal blossomed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE DRUG TRAFFICKING CONVICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by analyzing the assignments of error insofar as they relate to the conviction for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute.  The appellant assigns error in three respects.  We treat these claims seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>A. Suppression of Statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before us, the appellant assails the district court's refusal to suppress his statements regarding the clothing, the day bed, and the like.  His main thesis is that he exercised his prerogative to remain silent and demanded an attorney, but that the police rode roughshod over his rights.  He asseverates that, under these circumstances, the interrogation conducted by the officers at the search scene contravened the teachings of both Miranda and Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477, 484-85, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 1884-85, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981) (explaining that an accused, having voiced a desire to deal with the authorities only with the aid of a lawyer, is not subject to further police interrogation until counsel has been made available to him).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing orders granting or denying suppression motions, this court scrutinizes a district court's factual findings, including its credibility determinations, for traces of clear error.  See United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir.1994).  By contrast, we indulge plenary review of the lower court's answers to questions of law, including its ultimate resolution of the constitutional issue.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, whether or not to suppress the challenged statements boils down to a credibility call.  Such calls are grist for the district court's mill.  See, e.g., United States v. Rutkowski, 877 F.2d 139, 144 (1st Cir.1989).  The district court, having seen and heard the witnesses at first hand, chose to believe the mustered testimony of four law enforcement officers--Bathgate, DeAngelis, Panzarella, and Corley (two of whom testified unequivocally that the appellant had neither expressed a desire to stay silent nor requested counsel)--and rejected the appellant's contradictory version of his interaction with the police.  If we are to remain faithful to the jurisprudence of clear error, we cannot disturb this finding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See id.  (acknowledging that a judge's credibility choice between two plausible accounts of the events in question cannot be deemed clearly erroneous);  see also Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that there can be no clear error \"unless, on the whole of the record, [the court of appeals] form[s] a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>B. Admission of Opinion Testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, DeAngelis, after chronicling his experience as a narcotics detective and his encyclopedic familiarity with the mores of the crack cocaine community, testified as to the approximate \"street value\" (all told, roughly $1,500) of the 148 straws of crack found during the search.  He also explained that so large a quantity of crack was consistent with distribution as opposed to personal use.  Finally, he listed the visible characteristics of the prototypical crack addict, and noted that the appellant manifested none of these symptoms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant labors to convince us that this testimony should not have been admitted for two reasons:  first, it did not afford the jury appropriate assistance in determining his intent;  and second, it comprised an impermissible opinion concerning his supposed mental state.  We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  Rule 702.   Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, expert testimony is admissible if the witness qualifies as an expert and the proffered testimony \"will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 702.  The decision to admit or reject expert testimony is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court and the court's determinations are reviewable only for abuse of that discretion.  See United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 680 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Hoffman, 832 F.2d 1299, 1310 (1st Cir.1987).  Typically, appellate courts give trial judges a wide berth in respect to these kinds of discretionary judgments.  See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 680.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed through this lens, the district court's decision to admit DeAngelis's testimony appears to be properly focused.  DeAngelis's qualifications as an expert were not challenged either below or in the appellant's brief, and we readily accept them as sufficient.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Turning to the testimony, DeAngelis explained the amount of crack that users normally carry, the effects of an individual dose, and the price of each packet.  Matters involving dosages, prices, and other particulars endemic to the ingestion and distribution of crack cocaine are beyond the ken of the average juror.  Consequently, expert testimony on these subjects is likely to help the jury and, hence, if sanctioned by the trial judge, is admissible in evidence.  See United States v. Ladd, 885 F.2d 954, 959, 960 (1st Cir.1989) (approving admission of testimony that the quantity and packaging of certain heroin indicated its suitability for distribution).  Other courts, apparently reaching the same conclusion, have regularly upheld the admissibility of such expert testimony based upon the trial judge's belief that it would help the jurors.  See United States v. Tapia-Ortiz, 23 F.3d 738, 741 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 206, 286, 130 L.Ed.2d 136, 201 (1994);  United States v. Brown, 7 F.3d 648, 652 (7th Cir.1993);  United States v. McDonald, 933 F.2d 1519, 1522 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 897, 112 S.Ct. 270, 116 L.Ed.2d 222 (1991);  United States v. Safari, 849 F.2d 891, 895 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 945, 109 S.Ct. 374, 102 L.Ed.2d 363 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the district court heard and overruled the appellant's objections to the proffered testimony.  On this record, there is no principled way for us to second-guess that ruling.  Nor will we strain to do so:  we think that DeAngelis's testimony was likely welcomed by the jurors, who otherwise might not have understood the significance of such a large number of crack-filled straws.  Seen from this perspective, the testimony provided a factual predicate for the jury, presumably inexperienced in the customs of the crack cocaine community, to draw the inference that the appellant possessed cocaine base for the purpose of retail distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Rule 704(b).   In a related vein, the appellant, citing Fed.R.Evid. 704(b), suggests that the trial court improvidently allowed DeAngelis to testify to the appellant's state of mind (intent to distribute).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We reject the suggestion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 704(b) is of fairly recent vintage.  It emerged in 1984 as an offshoot of Congress's retooling of the insanity defense.  See S.Rep.No. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 230 (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3412 (explaining the need to limit psychiatric testimony as to the ultimate issue of sanity under the law).  Congress recommended that the new regime be applied broadly.  To this end, the Senate Report stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>[T]he rationale for precluding ultimate opinion psychiatric testimony extends beyond the insanity defense to any ultimate mental state of the defendant that is relevant to the legal conclusion sought to be proven.  The Committee has fashioned its Rule 704 provision to reach all such \"ultimate\" issues, e.g., premeditation in a homicide case, or lack of predisposition in entrapment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 3413.  Thus, both the letter of Rule 704(b) and the spirit that animates it preclude psychiatrists or other mental health professionals from testifying directly to a mental state or condition that constitutes an element of the crime charged (such as a criminal defendant's intent).  See United States v. Childress, 58 F.3d 693, 728 (D.C.Cir.1995);  United States v. Cameron, 907 F.2d 1051, 1060 (11th Cir.1990);  United States v. Pohlot, 827 F.2d 889, 906 (3d Cir.1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1011, 108 S.Ct. 710, 98 L.Ed.2d 660 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By like token, Rule 704(b) has not been restricted to testimony offered by psychiatrists and other mental health professionals.  To the precise contrary, courts have consistently read the rule to apply to cases in which intent is an element of the offense and an expert--whether or not a psychiatrist or other mental health professional--seeks to testify to the defendant's actual intent.  See, e.g., United States v. Buchanan, 70 F.3d 818, 824 (1995) (discussing narcotics officer's opinions in respect to defendant's specific intent to possess drugs);  United States v. Thomas S. Orr, 68 F.3d 1247, 1252 (10th Cir.1995) (discussing opinion evidence of witness skilled in banking practices in respect to defendant's intent to commit bank fraud), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 747, 133 L.Ed.2d 695 (1996);  United States v. Boyd, 55 F.3d 667, 670 (D.C.Cir.1995) (discussing police officer's opinions in respect to defendant's intent to distribute cocaine);  United States v. Windfelder, 790 F.2d 576, 582 (7th Cir.1986) (discussing IRS agent's opinions in respect to defendant's intent to evade taxes).  We, too, have indicated, albeit sub silentio, that Rule 704(b) potentially could apply to opinion testimony offered by a person other than a mental health professional.  See United States v. Lamattina, 889 F.2d 1191, 1193-94 (1st Cir.1989) (discussing FBI agent's testimony in loan-sharking case).  Given the unambiguous language of the rule and the weight of authority,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> we hold that Rule 704(b) prohibits all direct expert testimony concerning a criminal defendant's intent, regardless of the witness's field of expertise, so long as intent is an element of the crime charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion does not end our inquiry.  No matter how expansively Rule 704(b) is read, it is not limitless in its reach.  Though Rule 704(b) bars experts from opining on the ultimate issue of a defendant's felonious intent, the rule does not prohibit experts from testifying to predicate facts from which a jury might infer such intent.  See, e.g., Brown, 7 F.3d at 651 (explaining that Rule 704(b) does \"not preclude [ ] [an expert] from suggesting inferences to be drawn from the facts, including inferences that embrace an ultimate issue\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at hand fits neatly within this integument.  Here, the witness offered no testimony that directly characterized the appellant's intent to distribute controlled substances.  Instead, DeAngelis merely explained that the quantity of crack found at the search site was consistent with distribution, as opposed to personal use.  Because this evidence does no more than supply suggested predicate facts, allowing the jury to draw its own conclusions as to intent from those facts if it chooses to credit the testimony, it does not transgress Rule 704(b).  See United States v. Lipscomb, 14 F.3d 1236, 1240 (7th Cir.1994) (upholding the introduction of opinion testimony suggesting that a particular amount of crack indicated intended distribution, and distinguishing such testimony from testimony that the defendant intended to distribute crack).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Discerning no error, we hold that the district court acted within the realm of its discretion in permitting the jury to hear and consider the contested opinion testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>C. Sufficiency of the Evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A convicted defendant who presses a claim of evidentiary insufficiency faces an uphill climb.  If the evidence presented, taken in the light most agreeable to the government, is adequate to permit a rational jury to find each essential element of the offense of conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, then the defendant's claim fails.  See United States v. Olbres, 61 F.3d 967, 970 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 467 (1st Cir.1994).  Phrased another way, as long as the aggregate evidence justifies a judgment of conviction, \"it need not rule out other hypotheses more congenial to a finding of innocence.\"  Gifford, 17 F.3d at 467.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a criminal defendant undertakes a sufficiency challenge, all the evidence, direct and circumstantial, must be viewed from the government's coign of vantage, and the viewer must accept all reasonable inferences from it that are consistent with the verdict.  See United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 974 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. O'Brien, 14 F.3d 703, 706 (1st Cir.1994).  In other words, \"the trial judge must resolve all evidentiary conflicts and credibility questions in the prosecution's favor;  and, moreover, as among competing inferences, two or more of which are plausible, the judge must choose the inference that best fits the prosecution's theory of guilt.\"  Olbres, 61 F.3d at 970.   Because the district court's disposition of a motion for judgment of acquittal is subject to de novo review, see id., this court, like the trial court, must \"scrutinize the evidence in the light most compatible with the verdict, resolve all credibility disputes in the verdict's favor, and then reach a judgment about whether a rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Taylor, 54 F.3d at 974.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these straightforward rules to this record makes short shrift of the appellant's claim.  The elements of the offense of conviction are knowing possession of a controlled substance (here, crack) and intent to distribute that substance.  See United States v. Marin, 7 F.3d 679, 688 (7th Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 739, 126 L.Ed.2d 702 (1994).  Here, these elements were amply proven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The discovery of sizable quantities of crack at the appellant's place of abode and in his jacket, together with the appellant's admissions to the authorities, form a sturdy platform on which to load a finding of guilt.  The opinion evidence that we have recounted furnishes additional support for the finding.  It is clear to us that a rational jury, impartially assaying all the evidence, could have found beyond a reasonable doubt--as this jury did--that the prosecution had successfully proved the essential elements of the drug trafficking charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE FIREARMS CONVICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury also convicted the appellant on a charge of violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The appellant challenges this conviction, asserting that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this case was pending on appeal, the Supreme Court decided Bailey v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995).  The Bailey Court concluded that, in order to convict an accused for \"use\" of a firearm under section 924(c)(1), \"the Government must show active employment of the firearm.\"  Id. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 506.   Thus, \"liability attaches only to cases of actual use\" of a firearm, id. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 507, a standard that \"includes brandishing, displaying, bartering, striking with, and most obviously, firing or attempting to fire, a firearm.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This construction of the \"use\" prong of section 924(c)(1) resolved a split in the circuits, see id. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 504-07 (citing representative cases), and, in the bargain, abrogated earlier decisions of this court that permitted conviction under a more inclusive definition of \"use.\"   See, e.g., United States v. McFadden, 13 F.3d 463, 465 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that evidence of the presence of a gun under a mattress, with cash, near drugs, sufficed to show \"use\").  Consequently, we acknowledge that McFadden and its siblings are no longer good law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey is directly on point here.  At oral argument, the government confessed error, candidly admitting that its evidence was insufficient to show \"use\" under the Bailey standard.  Because our assessment of the record conduces to the same conclusion, we reverse the appellant's conviction under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c) and direct the district court to enter judgment in Valle's favor on that count.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, we affirm the appellant's conviction on the drug trafficking charge and reverse his conviction on the firearms charge.  Since it is conceivable that our disposition of the latter count might affect the sentencing calculus in regard to the former count, we honor counsels' joint request and remand to the district court for possible reconsideration of the sentence originally imposed on the drug trafficking count.  See generally United States v. Pimienta-Redondo, 874 F.2d 9, 14 (1st Cir.)  (en banc) (discussing, in a pre-Guidelines case, the district court's \"authority to reshape a sentence when multiple convictions garner mixed reviews on appeal--some affirmed, some reversed\"), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 890, 110 S.Ct. 233, 107 L.Ed.2d 185 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  We intimate no view as to whether the district court should undertake to reconsider the sentence previously imposed or, if it chooses to do so, what the appropriate outcome of such reconsideration might be.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Except for his contention that he invoked certain of his rights prior to questioning, the appellant has not maintained that his responses to police queries represented anything less than a knowing and intelligent waiver of his Miranda rights.  Any such argument is, therefore, waived.  See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Since we uphold the lower court's finding that the appellant did not assert his rights, but, rather, voluntarily elected to answer the officers' questions, we need not assess the correctness of the court's holding that the appellant's initial statement comprised a spontaneous utterance, not a response to constructive interrogation.  Though the detective's special brand of valet service was heavy-handed (both literally and figuratively), there is no basis on the present record for suppression of the appellant's retort</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> DeAngelis's testimony assisted the appellant in certain particulars.

We affirm the drug trafficking conviction but reverse the firearms conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 17, 1991, nine law enforcement officers converged upon an apartment located at 82 Glenham St., Providence, Rhode Island, to execute a search warrant.  Inside, they found three individuals:  the appellant, his grandmother (who leased the apartment), and Rafael Tavarez.  The police immediately segregated the trio in different chambers.  They placed the appellant in the kitchen under the watchful eye of Detective Michael Panzarella.  The search team then started its treasure hunt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short order, a narcotics detective, Guy DeAngelis, discovered a plastic bag secreted between the cushions of the living room couch.  Inside the bag were forty-seven cut straws with the ends burned shut.  Subsequent tests confirmed that each straw contained cocaine base, known colloquially as \"crack.\"   Another gendarme, Robert Clements, spied two firearms under a day bed in the dining room.  A third officer, John Corley, rummaged through the rear hall closet and found a plastic bag, containing an additional 101 crack-filled straws, in the pocket of a green jacket.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Promptly upon the discovery of the contraband, Panzarella read the appellant his rights.  See Miranda v. Arizona, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 479, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span> </a></span>(1966).  Meanwhile, the search continued.  DeAngelis proceeded to examine the contents of the rear hall closet, poring over items of apparel one by one and dropping each piece on the floor when he had finished his inspection of it.  The appellant (who enjoyed a clear view of the closet from the kitchen) harangued DeAngelis not to throw his clothing on the floor as he might want to wear it upon his release.  When DeAngelis asked the appellant whether he owned the clothes, the appellant responded affirmatively.  In reply to a specific inquiry, the appellant identified the crack-laden green jacket as belonging to him.  Later on, DeAngelis descended into the basement--an area to which all occupants of the building enjoyed common access--and came across a triple-beam scale of a type commonly associated with the packaging of illegal drugs for retail distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Near the end of the search, Corley asked the appellant where he slept.  The appellant pointed toward the day bed and said \"there.\"   To put the ribbon on the package, Sergeant Stephen Bathgate (the officer in charge of the operation) elicited incriminating comments from the appellant in the course of making the formal arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police transported the appellant to the station house.  After again receiving Miranda warnings, the appellant signed a form that signified his understanding of those rights.  He then called a friend and asked her to contact his attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, a federal grand jury handed up an indictment.  The appellant responded in part by filing a motion to suppress the statements he had made to the police during the search.  He advanced two arguments.  First, he insisted that, while still at Glenham St., he had invoked his right to remain silent and asked if he could contact his attorney, but that the police ignored his importuning and did not permit him to do so.  Second, he contended that DeAngelis had dumped the clothing on the floor in a wily effort to provoke him into making an inculpatory comment, and that, therefore, DeAngelis's antics should be treated as an impermissible constructive interrogation.  See Rhode Island v. Innis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110254\"><a href=\"/opinion/110254/rhode-island-v-innis/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span>, 301, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110254\"><a href=\"/opinion/110254/rhode-island-v-innis/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1682</span></a></span>, 1690, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110254\"><a href=\"/opinion/110254/rhode-island-v-innis/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">297</span> </a></span>(1980).  The government denied that the appellant invoked his right to remain silent or that he sought counsel while at the apartment.  It also argued that his initial complaint concerning the handling of his vestments was a spontaneous utterance, and that his subsequent statements amounted to a waiver of his Miranda rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following an evidentiary hearing, the district court ruled that DeAngelis's rearrangement of the appellant's wardrobe did not amount to an interrogation, and that the appellant's original objection to DeAngelis's behavior could properly be admitted into evidence as a spontaneous statement.  Sweeping more broadly, the court found as a matter of fact that the appellant had neither invoked his rights nor requested an attorney while the search was ongoing.  Consequently, the court ruled that, given the adequate warnings which preceded the officers' questions, the appellant's replies could be used against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the appellant did not seriously dispute his possession of crack cocaine, but, rather, concentrated his fire on the issue of distributive intent.  Some of the government's proof on this point came in the form of opinion testimony rendered by DeAngelis.  In the end, the jury bought the prosecution's wares and convicted the appellant on both counts.  The district court sentenced him to serve sixty-three months in prison on the drug trafficking charge, and added a consecutive sixty-month incarcerative term for the firearms count.  After a false start, the details of which are not relevant here, this appeal blossomed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE DRUG TRAFFICKING CONVICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by analyzing the assignments of error insofar as they relate to the conviction for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute.  The appellant assigns error in three respects.  We treat these claims seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>A.

His main thesis is that he exercised his prerogative to remain silent and demanded an attorney, but that the police rode roughshod over his rights.  He asseverates that, under these circumstances, the interrogation conducted by the officers at the search scene contravened the teachings of both Miranda and Edwards v.

The district court, having seen and heard the witnesses at first hand, chose to believe the mustered testimony of four law enforcement officers--Bathgate, DeAngelis, Panzarella, and Corley (two of whom testified unequivocally that the appellant had neither expressed a desire to stay silent nor requested counsel)--and rejected the appellant's contradictory version of his interaction with the police.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, expert testimony is admissible if the witness qualifies as an expert and the proffered testimony \"will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 702.  The decision to admit or reject expert testimony is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court and the court's determinations are reviewable only for abuse of that discretion.  See United States v.

DeAngelis's qualifications as an expert were not challenged either below or in the appellant's brief, and we readily accept them as sufficient.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Turning to the testimony, DeAngelis explained the amount of crack that users normally carry, the effects of an individual dose, and the price of each packet.  Matters involving dosages, prices, and other particulars endemic to the ingestion and distribution of crack cocaine are beyond the ken of the average juror.  Consequently, expert testimony on these subjects is likely to help the jury and, hence, if sanctioned by the trial judge, is admissible in evidence.  See United States v. Ladd, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529712\"><a href=\"/opinion/529712/united-states-v-gary-ladd/\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></a></span>, 959, 960 (1st Cir.1989) (approving admission of testimony that the quantity and packaging of certain heroin indicated its suitability for distribution).

On this record, there is no principled way for us to second-guess that ruling.  Nor will we strain to do so:  we think that DeAngelis's testimony was likely welcomed by the jurors, who otherwise might not have understood the significance of such a large number of crack-filled straws.  Seen from this perspective, the testimony provided a factual predicate for the jury, presumably inexperienced in the customs of the crack cocaine community, to draw the inference that the appellant possessed cocaine base for the purpose of retail distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Rule 704(b).   In a related vein, the appellant, citing Fed.R.Evid. 704(b), suggests that the trial court improvidently allowed DeAngelis to testify to the appellant's state of mind (intent to distribute).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We reject the suggestion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 704(b) is of fairly recent vintage.  It emerged in 1984 as an offshoot of Congress's retooling of the insanity defense.  See S.Rep.No. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 230 (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3412 (explaining the need to limit psychiatric testimony as to the ultimate issue of sanity under the law).  Congress recommended that the new regime be applied broadly.  To this end, the Senate Report stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>[T]he rationale for precluding ultimate opinion psychiatric testimony extends beyond the insanity defense to any ultimate mental state of the defendant that is relevant to the legal conclusion sought to be proven.  The Committee has fashioned its Rule 704 provision to reach all such \"ultimate\" issues, e.g., premeditation in a homicide case, or lack of predisposition in entrapment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 3413. </span> Thus, both the letter of Rule 704(b) and the spirit that animates it preclude psychiatrists or other mental health professionals from testifying directly to a mental state or condition that constitutes an element of the crime charged (such as a criminal defendant's intent).

To the precise contrary, courts have consistently read the rule to apply to cases in which intent is an element of the offense and an expert--whether or not a psychiatrist or other mental health professional--seeks to testify to the defendant's actual intent.  See, e.g., United States v.

We, too, have indicated, albeit sub silentio, that Rule 704(b) potentially could apply to opinion testimony offered by a person other than a mental health professional.  See United States v.

Given the unambiguous language of the rule and the weight of authority,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> we hold that Rule 704(b) prohibits all direct expert testimony concerning a criminal defendant's intent, regardless of the witness's field of expertise, so long as intent is an element of the crime charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion does not end our inquiry.  No matter how expansively Rule 704(b) is read, it is not limitless in its reach.  Though Rule 704(b) bars experts from opining on the ultimate issue of a defendant's felonious intent, the rule does not prohibit experts from testifying to predicate facts from which a jury might infer such intent.  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"655337\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Brown,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/655337/united-states-v-thyrus-montez-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">651</span> </a></span>(explaining that Rule 704(b) does \"not preclude [ ] [an expert] from suggesting inferences to be drawn from the facts, including inferences that embrace an ultimate issue\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at hand fits neatly within this integument.  Here, the witness offered no testimony that directly characterized the appellant's intent to distribute controlled substances.  Instead, DeAngelis merely explained that the quantity of crack found at the search site was consistent with distribution, as opposed to personal use.  Because this evidence does no more than supply suggested predicate facts, allowing the jury to draw its own conclusions as to intent from those facts if it chooses to credit the testimony, it does not transgress Rule 704(b).  See United States v. Lipscomb, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661509\"><a href=\"/opinion/661509/united-states-v-tony-lipscomb/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1236</span></a></span>, 1240 (7th Cir.1994) (upholding the introduction of opinion testimony suggesting that a particular amount of crack indicated intended distribution, and distinguishing such testimony from testimony that the defendant intended to distribute crack).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Discerning no error, we hold that the district court acted within the realm of its discretion in permitting the jury to hear and consider the contested opinion testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>C.

Sec. 924(c)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The appellant challenges this conviction, asserting that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this case was pending on appeal, the Supreme Court decided Bailey v. United States, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span> </a></span>(1995).  The Bailey Court concluded that, in order to convict an accused for \"use\" of a firearm under section 924(c)(1), \"the Government must show active employment of the firearm.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at ----, </a></span>116 S.Ct. at 506.   Thus, \"liability attaches only to cases of actual use\" of a firearm, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at ----, </a></span>116 S.Ct. at 507, a standard that \"includes brandishing, displaying, bartering, striking with, and most obviously, firing or attempting to fire, a firearm.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This construction of the \"use\" prong of section 924(c)(1) resolved a split in the circuits, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at ----, </a></span>116 S.Ct. at 504-07 (citing representative cases), and, in the bargain, abrogated earlier decisions of this court that permitted conviction under a more inclusive definition of \"use.\"   See, e.g., United States v. McFadden, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195146\"><a href=\"/opinion/195146/united-states-v-mcfadden/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">463</span></a></span>, 465 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that evidence of the presence of a gun under a mattress, with cash, near drugs, sufficed to show \"use\").  Consequently, we acknowledge that McFadden and its siblings are no longer good law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey is directly on point here.  At oral argument, the government confessed error, candidly admitting that its evidence was insufficient to show \"use\" under the Bailey standard.  Because our assessment of the record conduces to the same conclusion, we reverse the appellant's conviction under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c) and direct the district court to enter judgment in Valle's favor on that count.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, we affirm the appellant's conviction on the drug trafficking charge and reverse his conviction on the firearms charge.  Since it is conceivable that our disposition of the latter count might affect the sentencing calculus in regard to the former count, we honor counsels' joint request and remand to the district court for possible reconsideration of the sentence originally imposed on the drug trafficking count.  See generally United States v. Pimienta-Redondo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522862\"><a href=\"/opinion/522862/united-states-v-juan-pimienta-redondo-united-states-of-america-v-alfredo/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.)

Any such argument is, therefore, waived.  See United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Though the detective's special brand of valet service was heavy-handed (both literally and figuratively), there is no basis on the present record for suppression of the appellant's retort</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> DeAngelis's testimony assisted the appellant in certain particulars.
