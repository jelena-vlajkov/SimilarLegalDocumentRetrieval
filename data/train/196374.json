These  appeals arise from a\r                      STAHL, Circuit Judge.\r                                          \r\n\nproduct   liability  and  wrongful   death  suit  brought  by\r\n\nappellant Joao  Carreiro, whose wife Teresa  was killed while\r\n\noperating a machine press at The Robbins Company (\"Robbins\").\r\n\nCarreiro sued Rhodes Gill &amp; Co., Ltd. (\"Rhodes\"), the English\r\n\nmanufacturer  of  the  machine; H.  Leach  Machinery  Company\r\n\n(\"Leach\"), the dissolved domestic distributor of the machine;\r\n\nMain  Machinery  Company  (\"Main\"),  the   alleged  successor\r\n\ncorporation to  Leach;  and Rumford  Property  and  Liability\r\n\nInsurance  Company  (\"Rumford\")1, Leach's  insurance carrier.\r\n\nRhodes failed  to answer  the complaint and  defaulted.   The\r\n\ndistrict court  granted summary  judgment for Leach,  holding\r\n\nthat  it was not amenable  to suit because  it terminated its\r\n\ncorporate existence long before the accident.  The court then\r\n\ndismissed Rumford, ruling that there can be no  direct action\r\n\nagainst  the insurer  of  a dissolved  corporation under  the\r\n\napplicable Rhode  Island statute.  The  court granted summary\r\n\njudgment for Main, finding  that it was not the  successor to\r\n\nLeach.  Carreiro appeals those rulings,  which we now affirm.\r\n\nMain impleaded  Robbins,  who had  contractually  indemnified\r\n\nLeach when it  purchased the press. The  district court found\r\n\nthat  Main was not a  successor to Leach  and granted summary\r\n\njudgment for Robbins on Main's third-party claim.  Because we\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Rumford is in receivership and is represented in this\r\naction by its receiver, Barry G.

Overview\r                        \r\n\n          In reviewing the several  rulings appealed from, we\r\n\nfirst offer this brief  factual overview.  On March  7, 1988,\r\n\nTeresa  Carreiro  was operating  a \"New  Stamp-Matic\" machine\r\n\npress  while employed  at the  Robbins Company  in Attleboro,\r\n\nMassachusetts.  During  operations, a  piece of  a die  broke\r\n\noff, penetrated a plexiglass guard and struck Ms. Carreiro in\r\n\nthe neck, inflicting a fatal injury.  \r\n\n          Rhodes  manufactured  the allegedly  defective \"New\r\n\nStamp-Matic\"  press in England.   Leach, a seller  of new and\r\n\nused  machine  tools   and  the   authorized  United   States\r\n\ndistributor for Rhodes, sold it to Robbins in 1980.  In 1980,\r\n\nseveral  members of  the Leach  family who  were shareholders\r\n\nand/or  officers of  Leach  started a  new corporation,  Main\r\n\nMachinery Co., which continued in the business of selling new\r\n\nand used  machine tools, including \"New  Stamp-Matic\" presses\r\n\nmanufactured  by  Rhodes.     Subsequently,  in  1982,  Leach\r\n\ndissolved, a full six years before the accident.\r\n\nB.  Prior Proceedings  \r                                 \r\n\n          In February  1991, Joao Carreiro,  individually and\r\n\nas administrator of  the estate of  Teresa Carreiro, filed  a\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ndiversity complaint for product liability  and wrongful death\r\n\nin the  United  States District  Court  for the  District  of\r\n\nMassachusetts against Rhodes, Leach,  Main and Rumford.  Main\r\n\nimpleaded  Robbins  as a  third-party  defendant  based on  a\r\n\npreexisting  indemnification  agreement  between   Leach  and\r\n\nRobbins.     Rhodes  failed  to  answer   the  complaint  and\r\n\ndefaulted.   Leach  moved to  dismiss under  Fed. R.  Civ. P.\r\n\n12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6) in April 1991, asserting that it lacked\r\n\nthe capacity  to be  sued because dissolution  had terminated\r\n\nits corporate existence.   The district court deferred ruling\r\n\non  Leach's motion to dismiss in order to permit discovery by\r\n\nCarreiro on  Leach's claimed dissolution.  Meanwhile, Rumford\r\n\nfiled  a Rule  12(b)(6)  motion to  dismiss contending  that,\r\n\nbecause  the  dissolved Leach  lacked  capacity  to be  sued,\r\n\nRumford could not be sued under Rhode Island's  direct action\r\n\nstatute.  In March 1992, Leach renewed its motion to dismiss,\r\n\nsubmitting as  support the Rhode Island  Secretary of State's\r\n\ncertificate averring  that Leach  had dissolved on  March 25,\r\n\n1982.   In April 1992, Rumford renewed its motion to dismiss,\r\n\nagain based on Leach's  dissolution.  In an August  31, 1992,\r\n\norder,  the district  court,  Robert E.  Keeton, J.,  granted\r\n\nLeach's and  Rumford's motions to dismiss,2  finding no basis\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The district court treated Leach's motion to dismiss as a\r\nmotion for summary judgment under Fed R. Civ. P. 56 because\r\nLeach had presented material outside the pleading.  See Fed.\r                                                                   \r\nR. Civ. P. 12(b).\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nfor  Carreiro's  request  for  further discovery  on  Leach's\r\n\ndissolution.\r\n\n          In  April 1994,  Main  moved for  summary judgment,\r\n\nclaiming that it was not liable as a successor corporation to\r\n\nLeach.  Main and Robbins also filed cross-motions for summary\r\n\njudgment  on the issue of Robbins' liability to Main based on\r\n\nRobbins' agreement  to indemnify Leach.   The district court,\r\n\nRichard G. Stearns, J., found that Main was not the successor\r\n\nto Leach  and granted summary judgment for Main on Carreiro's\r\n\nclaims.  In  the same  order, Judge  Stearns granted  summary\r\n\njudgment for Robbins on Main's third-party claim, ruling that\r\n\nMain could not benefit  from Robbins' contractual  obligation\r\n\nto indemnify  Leach because  Main was not  Leach's successor.\r\n\nThese appeals ensued.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          Joao  Carreiro raises  four principal  arguments on\r\n\nappeal:   (1) genuine factual issues exist as to whether Main\r\n\nis  liable  as  a  successor corporation  to  Leach;  (2) the\r\n\ndistrict  court erred  in not  allowing further  discovery on\r\n\nwhether Leach had been properly dissolved; (3) Rhode Island's\r\n\ntwo-year  survival  period  for  claims against  a  dissolved\r\n\ncorporation does not preclude  this tort action against Leach\r\n\neven  though  the  accident  occurred  six  years  after  its\r\n\ndissolution;   and  (4) the  Rhode  Island  statute  allowing\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\ncertain  direct actions  against  the insurer  of a  deceased\r\n\nnatural  person applies as well to the insurer of a dissolved\r\n\ncorporation.  After setting forth the applicable standards of\r\n\nreview, we discuss each issue in turn.\r\n\nA.  Standards of Review\r                                   \r\n\n          1.

Leach sold the allegedly defective machine press to\r\n\nRobbins, Carreiro's employer, in 1980.  Leach, a Rhode Island\r\n\ncorporation, was originally owned and operated by Harry Leach\r\n\nand  his  sons Oscar  and Max.    After Harry  Leach's death,\r\n\nOscar, Max,  and  Max's son  Bruce were  the stockholders  of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Local Rule 56.1 of the United States District Court for\r\nthe District of Massachusetts requires the party moving for\r\nsummary judgment to provide a concise statement of the\r\nmaterial undisputed facts with citations to affidavits,\r\ndepositions, or other documentation permitted under Fed. R.\r\nCiv. P. 56(c).  The party opposing summary judgment must\r\nprovide a concise statement of material disputed facts, also\r\nwith citations to affidavits, etc.  Properly supported facts\r\nset forth by the moving party are deemed admitted unless\r\ncontroverted by the factual statement of the opposing party. \r\nSee generally Stepansichen v.

Leach sold new, rebuilt,  and used\r\n\nmachine  tools and  various  other pieces  of production  and\r\n\nmetalworking equipment, some of which it manufactured.\r\n\n          In March  1980, Main  was incorporated under  Rhode\r\n\nIsland  law  with  Max  Leach  and  his  three   children  as\r\n\nstockholders.   At incorporation and  at the time this action\r\n\ncommenced,  Oscar  Leach  was  not  a  stockholder  of  Main,\r\n\nalthough he was a director.  Its other officers and directors\r\n\nwere Max and  Bruce Leach.   Main's primary  business at  the\r\n\ntime of the  accident was the sale of used  machine tools and\r\n\nvarious  pieces  of  production and  metalworking  equipment.\r\n\nUnlike  Leach, it  never rebuilt  or manufactured  machinery.\r\n\nMain is a  registered agent  of Rhodes and  sells the  Rhodes\r\n\n\"New  Stamp-Matic\" press,  the  same press  that injured  Ms.\r\n\nCarreiro.  Thirteen of  Main's employees are former employees\r\n\nof Leach.  Main and Leach shared  the same address from 1980,\r\n\nwhen  Main  was  incorporated,  until 1982,  when  Leach  was\r\n\ndissolved, but Main always  had its own telephone  number and\r\n\nletterhead.  After  Leach dissolved, its address was  in care\r\n\nof  Bruce Leach.    In response  to  a discovery  request  by\r\n\nRobbins, Main produced certain documents of Leach. \r\n\n          In March  1982,  Leach was  voluntarily  dissolved.\r\n\nAll of Leach's inventory and assets were sold,  discarded, or\r\n\notherwise disposed  of; none were acquired  by or transferred\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nto  Main.  Main acquired no shares  of Leach stock.  Main was\r\n\nnever a  creditor of Leach, but it may have done service work\r\n\non some machines sold by Leach.\r\n\n          2. Analysis\r                                 \r\n\n          Carreiro argues  that  genuine issues  of  material\r\n\nfact precluded  summary judgment  for Main, but  Carreiro has\r\n\npointed  to  no  disputed  facts  in  either  his  memorandum\r                                            \r\n\nopposing summary judgment or his  brief on appeal.   Instead,\r\n\nhe asserts  in his  brief that \"[e]valuative  applications of\r\n\nlegal standards to the  facts are properly questions  for the\r\n\nfact  finder,\" citing as support Springer v. Seaman, 821 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n871, 876  (1st Cir. 1987)  (holding that application  of tort\r\n\nconcepts  of  foreseeability   and  superseding  cause   were\r\n\nproperly for jury).  We need not decide, however, whether the\r\n\ndoctrine  of corporate  successor  liability is  the sort  of\r\n\n\"evaluative application of a legal standard\"  appropriate for\r\n\na jury.   United States v. Rule  Indus., Inc., 878 F.2d  535,\r                                                         \r\n\n541-42  (1st Cir.  1989).   The summary judgment  record here\r\n\ncontains  no evidence of any transfer of assets from Leach to\r\n\nMain,  which, as we explain below, is a threshold requirement\r\n\nfor  successor  liability  under  the  theories  advanced  by\r\n\nCarreiro.  Thus,  there being  no genuine issues  of fact  in\r\n\ndispute, Main was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\r\n\n          (a)  Successor Liability Generally\r                                                        \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          The corporate law doctrine of \"successor liability\"\r\n\ncomprises  a set  of exceptions  to the  general rule  that a\r\n\ncorporation purchasing  the assets  of another is  not liable\r                                                                  \r\n\nfor the debts of the seller corporation.

Carreiro  argues that  Main  is  the\r\n\nsuccessor corporation to Leach based on the second (\"de facto\r\n\nmerger\") and third (\"mere continuation\") exceptions.  \r\n\n          Main  counters persuasively  that neither  of these\r\n\nexceptions apply  because there was no sale or other transfer\r\n\nof assets from Leach to Main.  Main asserts that because  the\r\n\n\"de  facto  merger\"  and \"mere  continuation\"  doctrines  are\r\n\nexceptions to the general  rule of non-liability following an\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nasset purchase,  they necessarily presuppose a  sale or other\r\n\ntransfer  of  assets  from  one corporation  to  its  alleged\r\n\nsuccessor.   We  agree.   As discussed  below, the  cases and\r\n\nother  authority cited  by both parties  apply the  \"de facto\r\n\nmerger\" or  \"mere continuation\"  exceptions only where  there\r\n\nhas  been a  purchase or  other transfer  of assets;  we have\r\n\nneither been  directed to nor found  any authority supporting\r\n\nthe  application of these  exceptions in the  absence of some\r\n\ntransfer of assets.  \r\n\n          (b)  Rhode Island Precedent\r                                                 \r\n\n          Several Rhode  Island  decisions have  applied  the\r\n\nmere continuation exception, but  each case involved an asset\r\n\ntransfer.

These  Rhode  Island  cases  apply  the  \"mere\r\n\ncontinuation\"  doctrine  to  impose  successor  liability  in\r\n\ncertain asset transfers, an exception to the general rule set\r\n\nforth  in  Baker  that  an  asset  transfer does  not  create\r                            \r\n\nsuccessor  liability.

In  our research of  \"scholarly works,\"\r\n\nsee  Gibson, 37 F.3d at 736, we find that successor liability\r                       \r\n\nin general, and the \"mere continuation\" and \"de facto merger\"\r\n\nexceptions in particular, are  always discussed and  analyzed\r\n\nin the context of inter-corporate asset transfers.  Scholarly\r\n\ninterest and  judicial innovation  in this area  of corporate\r\n\nlaw have  been fueled by concern  with corporate transactions\r\n\nstructured  as asset purchases  to avoid successor liability,\r\n\nwhich  exists in a statutory merger but generally does not in\r\n\nan asset purchase.

See  National\r                                                                         \r\n\nAmusements, Inc. v.  Town of  Dedham, 43 F.3d  731, 749  (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir.),  cert. denied,  115  S.

Further Discovery on Leach's Dissolution\r                                                        \r\n\n          Carreiro appeals the district court's denial of his\r\n\nrequest   for  additional  discovery   (after  the  discovery\r\n\ndeadline) that might have shown  that Leach was not dissolved\r\n\nin 1982  in accordance with Rhode Island law.  To support its\r\n\nmotion for  summary judgment, Leach submitted  a certificate,\r\n\nsigned by the First Deputy Secretary of State and bearing the\r\n\nstate  seal, attesting  to Leach's  dissolution on  March 25,\r\n\n1982.  Carreiro does not  challenge that the certificate  was\r\n\nvalidly issued, but instead argues that the court should have\r\n\nallowed  Carreiro  to   conduct  further  discovery   seeking\r\n\nunspecified evidence that Leach  had somehow failed to comply\r\n\nwith  the  statutory  requirements for  dissolution.    Rhode\r\n\nIsland law provides  that a certificate  of the secretary  of\r\n\nstate \"shall be  taken and  received in all  courts . . .  as\r\n\nprima facie evidence of the existence or non-existence of the\r                       \r\n\nfacts  stated therein.\"  R.I. Gen. Laws   7-1.1-134.  Because\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nLeach submitted the  certificate, the district court  treated\r\n\nLeach's renewed  motion to  dismiss as a  motion for  summary\r\n\njudgment.   See  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  12(b).   A party  opposing\r                           \r\n\nsummary judgment may have  additional discovery under Fed. R.\r\n\nCiv.  P. 56(f)  where it  cannot present  essential facts  by\r\n\naffidavit, but  the party must \"articulate  a plausible basis\r\n\nfor the belief that  discoverable materials exist which would\r\n\nraise a trialworthy issue.\"   Price v. General Motors  Corp.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n931  F.2d 162, 164 (1st Cir. 1991).  Carreiro neither pointed\r\n\nto any evidence nor made any  specific allegations that Leach\r\n\nfailed to  comply with the requirements  for dissolution, and\r\n\naccordingly  the  district  court's denial  of  the requested\r\n\ndiscovery was well within its discretion.     \r\n\nD.  Survival of Actions Against a Dissolved Corporation\r                                                                   \r\n\n          According  to  R.I. Gen  Laws    7-1.1-98, entitled\r\n\n\"Survival of remedy  after dissolution,\" a claimant may sue a\r\n\ndissolved corporation  for \"any  right or claim  existing, or\r\n\nany liability incurred, prior to the dissolution if action or\r\n\nother proceeding  thereon is  commenced within two  (2) years\r\n\nafter the date of dissolution.\"  Leach's dissolution in March\r\n\n1982 was certified by the Rhode Island Secretary of State and\r\n\nis uncontroverted  on the summary judgment  record.  Carreiro\r\n\nargues that  his suit  can be  brought against  the dissolved\r\n\nLeach  well after  the two-year  survival period  because the\r\n\nliability  was  not  incurred  \"prior  to  dissolution,\"  and\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\ntherefore  does  not fall  within  the literal  scope  of the\r\n\nstatute.\r\n\n          Although  there   is  no  Rhode   Island  case  law\r\n\ndiscussing   the  survival  of  claims  against  a  dissolved\r\n\ncorporation  under  section  7-1.1-98, the  Supreme  Court of\r\n\nRhode Island interpreted  the analogous Massachusetts statute\r\n\nin Halliwell Assocs.,  Inc. v. C.E. Maguire Servs., Inc., 586\r                                                                    \r\n\nA.2d 530 (R.I. 1991).  The court explained that at common law\r\n\n\"a corporation's  capacity to sue  or be sued  was completely\r\n\ndestroyed upon dissolution.\"   Id. at 533.  The  court added:\r                                              \r\n\n\"Today,  all  jurisdictions  have enacted  corporate-survival\r\n\nstatutes  that abrogate  the harsh  effect of  the common-law\r\n\nrule by  allowing a  corporation's existence to  continue for\r\n\nsome  time  past  the  date  of  dissolution  to  settle  its\r\n\ncorporate  affairs  gradually,   but  not  to  continue   its\r\n\nbusiness.\"   Id.   Rhode  Island has  enacted exactly  such a\r                            \r\n\nstatute,  section 7-1.1-98,  and the  Supreme Court  of Rhode\r\n\nIsland's explanation  of the  background common law  rule and\r\n\nthe intent behind the  typical survival statute is persuasive\r\n\nauthority  as to the proper interpretation of R.I. Gen. Law  \r\n\n7-1.1-98.   See supra  section II.B.2.(c) (discussing  use of\r                                 \r\n\nother  authority in  the  absence  of  a holding  by  state's\r\n\nhighest court).\r\n\n          In  light of  the Supreme  Court of  Rhode Island's\r\n\nexplanation  of  the legislative  intent  behind the  typical\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nsurvival statute,  the language at issue  in section 7-1.1-98\r\n\n(providing  a two-year survival  period only  for liabilities\r\n\nincurred \"prior to dissolution\") logically means that actions\r\n\non liabilities  incurred after dissolution do  not survive at\r                                          \r\n\nall, not  even for the  two-year wind-up period.   Carreiro's\r\n\nargument   that  actions   on   liabilities  incurred   after\r\n\ndissolution  survive forever  is  untenable in  light of  the\r\n\ncommon  law  rule  and  the legislative  intent  to  create a\r\n\nlimited  wind-up  period.    We conclude  that  Leach,  whose\r\n\ndissolution in 1982 is uncontroverted on the summary judgment\r\n\nrecord,  is not amenable to  a suit brought  almost ten years\r\n\nafter its dissolution and eight years after the expiration of\r\n\nthe  two-year survival  period.   Accordingly, we  affirm the\r\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment for Leach.\r\n\nE.  Direct Action Against Insurer of Dissolved Corporation\r                                                                      \r\n\n          The  district court  granted  Rumford's  motion  to\r\n\ndismiss  under Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 12(b)(6),  having determined\r\n\nthat  R.I. Gen. Laws   27-7-2 does not permit a direct action\r\n\nagainst the insurer  of a  dissolved corporation.   We  agree\r\n\nwith the district court's analysis and ruling.\r\n\n          Section  27-7-2  generally  bars a  plaintiff  from\r\n\njoining  an  insurer as  a defendant  in  a suit  against the\r\n\ninsured, a so-called  \"direct action.\"  An  exception to that\r\n\nbar  applies \"where before suit has  been brought and probate\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nproceedings have  not been initiated the  insured has died.\"4\r\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws    27-7-2.  Carreiro argues that  Leach \"died\"\r\n\nwhen  it  dissolved  in  1982, and  therefore  the  foregoing\r\n\nexception applies.\r\n\n          Carreiro's suggested interpretation of  section 27-\r\n\n2-2 is unpersuasive.  Although the statute's language  is not\r\n\nwithout difficulty, the Rhode Island Supreme Court has stated\r\n\nthat section 27-7-2 is \"free  from ambiguity and expresses  a\r\n\nplain  and sensible  meaning\" and  \"the meaning  so expressed\r\n\nwill be conclusively presumed  to be the one intended  by the\r\n\nLegislature.\"   Chalou v. LaPierre, 443 A.2d 1241, 1241 (R.I.\r                                              \r\n\n1982).   The plain and  sensible meaning of  the statute does\r\n\nnot  authorize  direct  actions  against  the  insurer  of  a\r\n\ndissolved corporation for the following reasons.\r\n\n          First,  the  plain and  sensible meaning  of \"died\"\r\n\ndoes  not  embrace  the  dissolution of  a  corporation,  and\r\n\nCarreiro points to  no Rhode Island authority supporting such\r\n\nan interpretation.\r\n\n          Second,  the  legislature  surely  understood  that\r\n\ncorporations do not enter  probate proceedings; this strongly\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  The syntax of the statute is rather convoluted.  Contrary\r\nto what the statute suggests, we believe that probate\r\nproceedings in Rhode Island are never initiated before death. \r\nThe Rhode Island Supreme Court has given this provision its\r\nonly logical meaning - that \"where probate proceedings have\r\nbeen initiated before suit is brought, the plaintiff may not\r\nproceed directly against the insurer.\"  Markham v. Allstate\r                                                                       \r\nIns. Co., 352 A.2d 651, 653 (R.I. 1976).\r                    \r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nimplies that it  did not  intend to apply  this exception  to\r\n\ncorporations.   Furthermore, the  statute provides  that once\r\n\nprobate has been initiated, direct action against the insurer\r\n\nof a deceased  natural person  is no longer  available.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nMarkham  v. Allstate Ins. Co., 352 A.2d 651, 653 (R.I. 1976).\r                                         \r\n\nThus, the legislature intended  this exception to the general\r\n\nrule  barring direct  action to  apply only  during  the time\r\n\nbetween  the  death  of  the insured  and  the  initiation of\r\n\nprobate.  If we accept Carreiro's interpretation, there would\r\n\nbe  no  analogous temporal  limitation  on  the exception  as\r\n\napplied to  a dissolved  corporation since probate  cannot be\r\n\ninitiated.   Under  that  view an  insurer  would be  forever\r\n\namenable  to direct action, and there is no reason to believe\r\n\nthat the legislature intended such a result.\r\n\n          Third,  Carreiro's  proposed interpretation  of the\r\n\nstatute would increase the insurer's liability beyond that of\r\n\nthe  insured.   The  Supreme Court  of  Rhode Island  held in\r\n\nBarber  v. Canela, 570 A.2d 670 (R.I. 1990), that section 27-\r                             \r\n\n7-2 did not enlarge  the liability of the insurer  beyond the\r\n\nlimits  stated in the  policy.   It set  forth as  a \"general\r\n\nrule\"  that any rights of a plaintiff against the insurer are\r\n\n\"dependent upon the existence of liability of the insurer  to\r\n\nthe insured under  the contract  of insurance.\"   Id. at  671\r                                                                 \r\n\n(quoting George  J. Couch, et  al., 12A  Couch Cyclopedia  of\r                                                                         \r\n\nInsurance Law  2d   45:833 at  486 (1981)).  A  direct action\r                             \r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nhere,  where the  insured  cannot be  sued  because it  is  a\r\n\ndissolved corporation, would contravene  that rule.  It would\r\n\nbe  unreasonable  for  us  to reach  that  result  through  a\r\n\ntortured  interpretation of the statute and without precedent\r\n\nunder Rhode Island law.\r\n\n          In light  of the foregoing, we  find it unnecessary\r\n\nto  certify this  statutory  interpretation  question to  the\r\n\nSupreme  Court of Rhode  Island as  Carreiro urges.   Because\r\n\nsection 27-7-2 generally prohibits direct actions against the\r\n\ninsurer of a potentially liable party and because we conclude\r\n\nthat  Carreiro's  suit  does  not fit  within  the  statutory\r\n\nexceptions to  that prohibition,  we affirm the  dismissal of\r\n\nRumford. \r\n\nF.

These  appeals arise from a\r                      STAHL, Circuit Judge.\r                                          \r\n\nproduct   liability  and  wrongful   death  suit  brought  by\r\n\nappellant Joao  Carreiro, whose wife Teresa  was killed while\r\n\noperating a machine press at The Robbins Company (\"Robbins\").\r\n\nCarreiro sued Rhodes Gill &amp; Co., Ltd. (\"Rhodes\"), the English\r\n\nmanufacturer  of  the  machine; H.  Leach  Machinery  Company\r\n\n(\"Leach\"), the dissolved domestic distributor of the machine;\r\n\nMain  Machinery  Company  (\"Main\"),  the   alleged  successor\r\n\ncorporation to  Leach;  and Rumford  Property  and  Liability\r\n\nInsurance  Company  (\"Rumford\")1, Leach's  insurance carrier.\r\n\nRhodes failed  to answer  the complaint and  defaulted.   The\r\n\ndistrict court  granted summary  judgment for Leach,  holding\r\n\nthat  it was not amenable  to suit because  it terminated its\r\n\ncorporate existence long before the accident.  The court then\r\n\ndismissed Rumford, ruling that there can be no  direct action\r\n\nagainst  the insurer  of  a dissolved  corporation under  the\r\n\napplicable Rhode  Island statute.  The  court granted summary\r\n\njudgment for Main, finding  that it was not the  successor to\r\n\nLeach.  Carreiro appeals those rulings,  which we now affirm.\r\n\nMain impleaded  Robbins,  who had  contractually  indemnified\r\n\nLeach when it  purchased the press. The  district court found\r\n\nthat  Main was not a  successor to Leach  and granted summary\r\n\njudgment for Robbins on Main's third-party claim.

Overview\r                        \r\n\n          In reviewing the several  rulings appealed from, we\r\n\nfirst offer this brief  factual overview.  On March  7, 1988,\r\n\nTeresa  Carreiro  was operating  a \"New  Stamp-Matic\" machine\r\n\npress  while employed  at the  Robbins Company  in Attleboro,\r\n\nMassachusetts.  During  operations, a  piece of  a die  broke\r\n\noff, penetrated a plexiglass guard and struck Ms. Carreiro in\r\n\nthe neck, inflicting a fatal injury.  \r\n\n          Rhodes  manufactured  the allegedly  defective \"New\r\n\nStamp-Matic\"  press in England.   Leach, a seller  of new and\r\n\nused  machine  tools   and  the   authorized  United   States\r\n\ndistributor for Rhodes, sold it to Robbins in 1980.  In 1980,\r\n\nseveral  members of  the Leach  family who  were shareholders\r\n\nand/or  officers of  Leach  started a  new corporation,  Main\r\n\nMachinery Co., which continued in the business of selling new\r\n\nand used  machine tools, including \"New  Stamp-Matic\" presses\r\n\nmanufactured  by  Rhodes.     Subsequently,  in  1982,  Leach\r\n\ndissolved, a full six years before the accident.\r\n\nB.  Prior Proceedings  \r                                 \r\n\n          In February  1991, Joao Carreiro,  individually and\r\n\nas administrator of  the estate of  Teresa Carreiro, filed  a\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ndiversity complaint for product liability  and wrongful death\r\n\nin the  United  States District  Court  for the  District  of\r\n\nMassachusetts against Rhodes, Leach,  Main and Rumford.  Main\r\n\nimpleaded  Robbins  as a  third-party  defendant  based on  a\r\n\npreexisting  indemnification  agreement  between   Leach  and\r\n\nRobbins.     Rhodes  failed  to  answer   the  complaint  and\r\n\ndefaulted.   Leach  moved to  dismiss under  Fed. R.  Civ. P.\r\n\n12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6) in April 1991, asserting that it lacked\r\n\nthe capacity  to be  sued because dissolution  had terminated\r\n\nits corporate existence.   The district court deferred ruling\r\n\non  Leach's motion to dismiss in order to permit discovery by\r\n\nCarreiro on  Leach's claimed dissolution.  Meanwhile, Rumford\r\n\nfiled  a Rule  12(b)(6)  motion to  dismiss contending  that,\r\n\nbecause  the  dissolved Leach  lacked  capacity  to be  sued,\r\n\nRumford could not be sued under Rhode Island's  direct action\r\n\nstatute.  In March 1992, Leach renewed its motion to dismiss,\r\n\nsubmitting as  support the Rhode Island  Secretary of State's\r\n\ncertificate averring  that Leach  had dissolved on  March 25,\r\n\n1982.   In April 1992, Rumford renewed its motion to dismiss,\r\n\nagain based on Leach's  dissolution.  In an August  31, 1992,\r\n\norder,  the district  court,  Robert E.  Keeton, J.,  granted\r\n\nLeach's and  Rumford's motions to dismiss,2  finding no basis\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The district court treated Leach's motion to dismiss as a\r\nmotion for summary judgment under Fed R. Civ. P. 56 because\r\nLeach had presented material outside the pleading.  See Fed.\r                                                                   \r\nR. Civ. P. 12(b).\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nfor  Carreiro's  request  for  further discovery  on  Leach's\r\n\ndissolution.\r\n\n          In  April 1994,  Main  moved for  summary judgment,\r\n\nclaiming that it was not liable as a successor corporation to\r\n\nLeach.  Main and Robbins also filed cross-motions for summary\r\n\njudgment  on the issue of Robbins' liability to Main based on\r\n\nRobbins' agreement  to indemnify Leach.   The district court,\r\n\nRichard G. Stearns, J., found that Main was not the successor\r\n\nto Leach  and granted summary judgment for Main on Carreiro's\r\n\nclaims.  In  the same  order, Judge  Stearns granted  summary\r\n\njudgment for Robbins on Main's third-party claim, ruling that\r\n\nMain could not benefit  from Robbins' contractual  obligation\r\n\nto indemnify  Leach because  Main was not  Leach's successor.\r\n\nThese appeals ensued.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          Joao  Carreiro raises  four principal  arguments on\r\n\nappeal:   (1) genuine factual issues exist as to whether Main\r\n\nis  liable  as  a  successor corporation  to  Leach;  (2) the\r\n\ndistrict  court erred  in not  allowing further  discovery on\r\n\nwhether Leach had been properly dissolved; (3) Rhode Island's\r\n\ntwo-year  survival  period  for  claims against  a  dissolved\r\n\ncorporation does not preclude  this tort action against Leach\r\n\neven  though  the  accident  occurred  six  years  after  its\r\n\ndissolution;   and  (4) the  Rhode  Island  statute  allowing\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\ncertain  direct actions  against  the insurer  of a  deceased\r\n\nnatural  person applies as well to the insurer of a dissolved\r\n\ncorporation.  After setting forth the applicable standards of\r\n\nreview, we discuss each issue in turn.\r\n\nA.  Standards of Review\r                                   \r\n\n          1.

Leach sold the allegedly defective machine press to\r\n\nRobbins, Carreiro's employer, in 1980.  Leach, a Rhode Island\r\n\ncorporation, was originally owned and operated by Harry Leach\r\n\nand  his  sons Oscar  and Max.

Main asserts that because  the\r\n\n\"de  facto  merger\"  and \"mere  continuation\"  doctrines  are\r\n\nexceptions to the general  rule of non-liability following an\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nasset purchase,  they necessarily presuppose a  sale or other\r\n\ntransfer  of  assets  from  one corporation  to  its  alleged\r\n\nsuccessor.   We  agree.   As discussed  below, the  cases and\r\n\nother  authority cited  by both parties  apply the  \"de facto\r\n\nmerger\" or  \"mere continuation\"  exceptions only where  there\r\n\nhas  been a  purchase or  other transfer  of assets;  we have\r\n\nneither been  directed to nor found  any authority supporting\r\n\nthe  application of these  exceptions in the  absence of some\r\n\ntransfer of assets.  \r\n\n          (b)  Rhode Island Precedent\r                                                 \r\n\n          Several Rhode  Island  decisions have  applied  the\r\n\nmere continuation exception, but  each case involved an asset\r\n\ntransfer.

To support its\r\n\nmotion for  summary judgment, Leach submitted  a certificate,\r\n\nsigned by the First Deputy Secretary of State and bearing the\r\n\nstate  seal, attesting  to Leach's  dissolution on  March 25,\r\n\n1982.  Carreiro does not  challenge that the certificate  was\r\n\nvalidly issued, but instead argues that the court should have\r\n\nallowed  Carreiro  to   conduct  further  discovery   seeking\r\n\nunspecified evidence that Leach  had somehow failed to comply\r\n\nwith  the  statutory  requirements for  dissolution.    Rhode\r\n\nIsland law provides  that a certificate  of the secretary  of\r\n\nstate \"shall be  taken and  received in all  courts . . .  as\r\n\nprima facie evidence of the existence or non-existence of the\r                       \r\n\nfacts  stated therein.\"  R.I.

Carreiro neither pointed\r\n\nto any evidence nor made any  specific allegations that Leach\r\n\nfailed to  comply with the requirements  for dissolution, and\r\n\naccordingly  the  district  court's denial  of  the requested\r\n\ndiscovery was well within its discretion.     \r\n\nD.

Carreiro's\r\n\nargument   that  actions   on   liabilities  incurred   after\r\n\ndissolution  survive forever  is  untenable in  light of  the\r\n\ncommon  law  rule  and  the legislative  intent  to  create a\r\n\nlimited  wind-up  period.    We conclude  that  Leach,  whose\r\n\ndissolution in 1982 is uncontroverted on the summary judgment\r\n\nrecord,  is not amenable to  a suit brought  almost ten years\r\n\nafter its dissolution and eight years after the expiration of\r\n\nthe  two-year survival  period.

We  agree\r\n\nwith the district court's analysis and ruling.\r\n\n          Section  27-7-2  generally  bars a  plaintiff  from\r\n\njoining  an  insurer as  a defendant  in  a suit  against the\r\n\ninsured, a so-called  \"direct action.\"  An  exception to that\r\n\nbar  applies \"where before suit has  been brought and probate\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nproceedings have  not been initiated the  insured has died.\"4\r\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws    27-7-2.

Although the statute's language  is not\r\n\nwithout difficulty, the Rhode Island Supreme Court has stated\r\n\nthat section 27-7-2 is \"free  from ambiguity and expresses  a\r\n\nplain  and sensible  meaning\" and  \"the meaning  so expressed\r\n\nwill be conclusively presumed  to be the one intended  by the\r\n\nLegislature.\"   Chalou v.

The plain and  sensible meaning of  the statute does\r\n\nnot  authorize  direct  actions  against  the  insurer  of  a\r\n\ndissolved corporation for the following reasons.\r\n\n          First,  the  plain and  sensible meaning  of \"died\"\r\n\ndoes  not  embrace  the  dissolution of  a  corporation,  and\r\n\nCarreiro points to  no Rhode Island authority supporting such\r\n\nan interpretation.\r\n\n          Second,  the  legislature  surely  understood  that\r\n\ncorporations do not enter  probate proceedings; this strongly\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  The syntax of the statute is rather convoluted.  Contrary\r\nto what the statute suggests, we believe that probate\r\nproceedings in Rhode Island are never initiated before death. \r\nThe Rhode Island Supreme Court has given this provision its\r\nonly logical meaning - that \"where probate proceedings have\r\nbeen initiated before suit is brought, the plaintiff may not\r\nproceed directly against the insurer.\"  Markham v. Allstate\r                                                                       \r\nIns.

Furthermore, the  statute provides  that once\r\n\nprobate has been initiated, direct action against the insurer\r\n\nof a deceased  natural person  is no longer  available.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nMarkham  v. Allstate Ins.

If we accept Carreiro's interpretation, there would\r\n\nbe  no  analogous temporal  limitation  on  the exception  as\r\n\napplied to  a dissolved  corporation since probate  cannot be\r\n\ninitiated.   Under  that  view an  insurer  would be  forever\r\n\namenable  to direct action, and there is no reason to believe\r\n\nthat the legislature intended such a result.\r\n\n          Third,  Carreiro's  proposed interpretation  of the\r\n\nstatute would increase the insurer's liability beyond that of\r\n\nthe  insured.
