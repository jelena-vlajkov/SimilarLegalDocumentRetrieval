Herminio   Perez  Perez  was\r                                        \r\n\nformerly a  sergeant with the Puerto  Rico Police Department.\r\n\nIn  1989, he was charged under Puerto Rico law with attempted\r\n\nmurder and concealing evidence.  The charges stemmed from  an\r\n\nincident in which Perez allegedly shot and wounded two riders\r\n\non a motorcycle  while seeking to bring it to  a halt.  Perez\r\n\nwas  tried in Puerto Rico Superior Court and acquitted by the\r\n\njury on both counts.\r\n\n     In  1992, Perez was indicted by a federal grand jury, in\r\n\nconnection with the same  shooting incident, and charged with\r\n\ndeprivation  of rights under color of law, in violation of 18\r\n\nU.S.C.   242, and using a firearm during the  commission of a\r\n\ncrime of  violence, in violation of  18 U.S.C.    924(c).  In\r\n\n1993,  a jury  convicted Perez  on both  charges, and  he was\r\n\nsentenced  to  106 months'  imprisonment.    He now  appeals,\r\n\nraising a variety of different claims of error.  \r\n\n     1.   In the district  court, Perez moved  to dismiss the\r\n\nfederal convictions on double  jeopardy grounds.  Although he\r\n\nconceded that  successive state and federal prosecutions were\r\n\npermitted  under the  doctrine of  \"dual sovereignty,\"  Perez\r\n\nmaintained  that  Puerto  Rico  should not  be  considered  a\r\n\nsovereign distinct  from the  federal government.   The trial\r\n\njudge  denied  the  motion,  adhering to  precedent  in  this\r\n\ncircuit.  United States v. Lopez Andino, 831 F.2d 1164, 1167-\r                                                   \r\n\n68 (1st Cir. 1987).  \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\n     Successive prosecutions even  by the  same sovereign  do\r\n\nnot  violate the  double  jeopardy principles  if the  second\r\n\nprosecution involved substantively different offenses.  Under\r\n\nthe test of Blockburger  v. United States, 284 U.S.  299, 304\r                                                     \r\n\n(1932),  readopted in United States v. Dixon, 113 S. Ct. 2849\r                                                        \r\n\n(1993), offenses are \"different\" for this purpose so  long as\r\n\n\"each [offense]  requires proof  of an additional  fact which\r\n\nthe other  does not\".   Even  were we  here concerned with  a\r\n\nsingle  sovereign, Perez' claim  would fail under Blockburger\r                                                                         \r\n\nbecause the federal offenses and the  Puerto Rico offenses do\r\n\nhave different elements.\r\n\n     The  attempted murder  charge  under  Puerto  Rico  law,\r\n\nunlike the federal civil  rights offense, requires proof that\r\n\na  defendant  acted  with the  intent  to  kill  or with  the\r\n\nforeseeable  consequence of  causing death.   P.R.  Laws Ann.\r\n\ntit.  33    3062, 4001  (1991); People v. Betancourt Asencio,\r                                                                        \r\n\n110 P.R.  Dec.  510 (1980).   Conversely,  the federal  civil\r\n\nrights  charge in  this case  required proof of  elements not\r\n\nrequired by the attempted  murder charge, including a showing\r\n\nthat  the defendant acted  under color of  law.   18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n242.\r\n\n     The only  two charges  that even vaguely  resembled each\r\n\nother are  the two just  discussed.  The  remaining charges--\r\n\nconcealment  of evidence  under  local law  and the  firearms\r\n\nviolation under  federal law--are not even  arguably the same\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\ncharge as each  other or  as either the  attempted murder  or\r\n\ncivil rights  charge.   In sum, Blockburger  disposes of  the\r                                                       \r\n\ndouble jeopardy claim, so  the result would be the  same even\r\n\nif Lopez Andino had never been decided. \r                           \r\n\n     2.  As a fall-back position, Perez argues that under the\r\n\ndoctrine of collateral estoppel,  the federal prosecution was\r\n\nbarred  because it  required relitigation  of factual  issues\r\n\nresolved in Perez' favor during the Puerto Rico trial.  Perez\r\n\nsuggests that his acquittal  on murder charges was equivalent\r\n\nto  a  finding  that  he  had not  used  unreasonable  force,\r\n\nunreasonable  force being  the premise  of the  federal civil\r\n\nrights charge.  United States v. McQueeney, 674 F.2d 109, 113\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1982).\r\n\n     Although the doctrine of  collateral estoppel applies in\r\n\ncriminal cases, Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 443-44 (1970),\r                                           \r\n\nthe  party to be precluded must have  been the same as, or in\r\n\nprivity with, the party  who lost on that issue in  the prior\r\n\nlitigation.   United States v.  Bonilla Romero, 836  F.2d 39,\r                                                          \r\n\n42-44 (1st Cir. 1987).  Perez makes no effort to adduce facts\r\n\nshowing  privity in this case between federal and Puerto Rico\r\n\nprosecutors,  possibly because  he  thinks  that his  \"single\r\n\nsovereign\" argument establishes  an identity between the  two\r\n\ngovernments,  an argument this  court has previously rejected\r\n\nin Bonilla Romero itself.  Id.\r                                          \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     But all this  makes no  difference to  the outcome,  for\r\n\neven  assuming identity or  privity among  prosecutors, Perez\r\n\nhas  not shown  that any  fact previously  determined in  his\r\n\nfavor in the local trial was relitigated in the federal case.\r\n\nA defendant can be  acquitted of attempted murder even  if he\r\n\nused excessive force.  To be sure, Perez could have sought to\r\n\nshow  from  the court  records of  the  first trial  that the\r\n\nexcessive  force issue, or  some other issue  critical in the\r\n\nfederal trial, was actually  tried and necessarily decided in\r\n\nhis favor in the first case, but he has made  no such showing\r\n\nhere.   United States  v. Aquilar-Aranceta, 957  F.2d 18,  23\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).    3.  Perez says that the trial judge erred\r\n\nby  instructing the  jury, prior to  closing argument  by the\r\n\ngovernment, to \"give close attention\" to the prosecutor.  The\r\n\ntrial judge  made no similar remark  before defense counsel's\r\n\nclosing,  and Perez asserts  that this discrepancy improperly\r\n\n\"carried the weight of the judge to one side of the balance.\"\r\n\nPerez did not raise this issue in the district court when the\r\n\ndiscrepancy could  easily have  been corrected, so  we review\r\n\nonly for plain error.  United States v. Olivier-Diaz, 13 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n1, 5 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n     The  challenged  remark was  innocuous in  isolation and\r\n\ncould  not have prejudiced the jury  unless it were part of a\r\n\npattern of remarks favoring the government.  No  such pattern\r\n\nis alleged  or  apparent  from the  record.    Indeed,  while\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\ndiscussing  closing arguments generally, the judge admonished\r\n\nthe  jury to \"give  your close attention  to the [prosecution\r\n\nand defense] attorneys while they address you.\"  In the final\r\n\ncharge, the judge told the jury that he had no opinion in the\r\n\ncase  and   that  anything  suggesting  otherwise  should  be\r\n\ndisregarded.  We see no error, let  alone plain error, in the\r\n\nchallenged remark.    \r\n\n     4.   Perez next asserts that the district court erred in\r\n\nnot permitting the defense to offer the testimony of Sergeant\r\n\nNeftalie Hernandez  Santiago to impeach the  credibility of a\r\n\ngovernment witness,  officer Ricardo  Nieves  Lopez.   During\r\n\ncross-examination,   Nieves   conceded  that   fellow  police\r\n\nofficers,  including Hernandez,  had accused  him of  various\r\n\nincidents  of  misconduct.    Nieves  maintained  that  these\r\n\nallegations were baseless and had been made only to retaliate\r\n\nfor  his testimony  in Perez'  previous trial.    The defense\r\n\ncalled officer Hernandez to  elicit testimony that Nieves had\r\n\nengaged in the alleged misconduct. \r\n\n     The district  court in excluding the Hernandez testimony\r\n\nreferred to  Fed. R. Evid. 608(b),  which precludes extrinsic\r\n\nevidence of bad  acts (other than convictions)  to support or\r\n\nattack the  credibility of a witness.   The notion underlying\r\n\nthe rule  is that while certain  prior good or bad  acts of a\r\n\nwitness   may  constitute   character  evidence   bearing  on\r                                                 \r\n\nveracity, they are  not evidence of  enough force to  justify\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nthe  detour  of extrinsic  proof.   Thus, Rule  608(b) barred\r\n\nHernandez' testimony insofar  as it was offered to  show that\r\n\nNieves had a propensity to lie.\r\n\n     Of  course,  Hernandez' testimony  would  not only  have\r\n\nsuggested that  Nieves was  of bad  character but  would also\r\n\nhave contradicted  Nieves' own denials on  the witness stand.\r\n\nImpeachment  by   contradiction  is  a  recognized   mode  of\r                                           \r\n\nimpeachment  not governed by Rule  608(b), 28 C.  Wright &amp; V.\r\n\nGold, Federal Practice and  Procedure   6118, at 103  (1993),\r                                                 \r\n\nbut by  common-law principles.  United  States v. Innamorati,\r                                                                        \r\n\n996  F.2d 456, 479-80 (1st  Cir. 1993), cert.  denied, 114 S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nCt.  409  (1993).     But,  again  largely   for  reasons  of\r\n\nefficiency, extrinsic evidence to  impeach is only admissible\r\n\nfor   contradiction   where   the   prior   testimony   being\r\n\ncontradicted  was itself material to  the case at  hand.  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nHere, Nieves'  alleged misconduct was not  material to Perez'\r\n\nguilt or innocence.\r\n\n     Finally, Perez'  brief says  that  Hernandez would  also\r\n\nhave testified that Nieves' reputation for veracity was poor.\r                                                  \r\n\nReputation  evidence of  this kind  is sometimes  admissible,\r\n\nFed. R.  Evid. 608(a), although  its weight is  usually quite\r\n\nlimited--precisely     because    specific     examples    of\r\n\nuntruthfulness  cannot   be  elicited  in  support.     3  J.\r\n\nWeinstein, M.  Berger &amp; J.  McLaughlin, Weinstein's  Evidence\r                                                                         \r\n\npara. 608[3], at 608-28 (1995).  In all events, Perez did not\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nadvise  the  trial  court  of  this  facet  of  the  proposed\r\n\ntestimony,  so the argument is effectively lost.  See Fed. R.\r                                                                 \r\n\nEvid. 103(a)(2).\r\n\n     5.   Finally, Perez claims that the trial court erred in\r\n\ndeclining  to adjust  his  sentence downward  two levels  for\r\n\nacceptance of  responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G.    3E1.1.\r\n\nSince  this claim  was not  made in  the district  court, our\r\n\nreview is limited to  plain error.  Olivier-Diaz, 13  F.3d at\r                                                            \r\n\n5.  In support of his claim, Perez offers only a statement in\r\n\nthe presentence report indicating that he \"expressed  remorse\r\n\nfor his  wrongdoing and  accepted  responsibility for  same,\"\r\n\nalthough  the  probation  officer ultimately  concluded  that\r\n\nPerez was not entitled to a downward adjustment.  \r\n\n     In all events, the record  shows that Perez continued to\r\n\ndeny responsibility for his crime at sentencing, stating that\r\n\nhe  lacked  criminal intent  at the  time  of the  crimes and\r\n\ndeclaring his innocence.  Thus,  there is no indication  that\r\n\nthe trial judge committed an error, let alone plain error, in\r\n\ndenying a downward adjustment.  U.S.S.G.    3E1.1(a).  Perez'\r\n\nfurther  suggestion that the district court had to recite its\r\n\nreasons for denying the  downward adjustment is mistaken; the\r\n\nreasons  were and are apparent  from the record.   See United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

Sec. 242, and using a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c).  In 1993, a jury convicted Perez on both charges, and he was sentenced to 106 months' imprisonment.  He now appeals, raising a variety of different claims of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. In the district court, Perez moved to dismiss the federal convictions on double jeopardy grounds.  Although he conceded that successive state and federal prosecutions were permitted under the doctrine of \"dual sovereignty,\" Perez maintained that Puerto Rico should not be considered a sovereign distinct from the federal government.  The trial judge denied the motion, adhering to precedent in this circuit.  United States v. Lopez Andino, 831 F.2d 1164, 1167-68 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Successive prosecutions even by the same sovereign do not violate double jeopardy principles if the second prosecution involved substantively different offenses.  Under the test of Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), readopted in United States v. Dixon, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2849, 125 L.Ed.2d 556 (1993), offenses are \"different\" for this purpose so long as \"each [offense] requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not\".  Even were we here concerned with a single sovereign, Perez' claim would fail under Blockburger because the federal offenses and the Puerto Rico offenses do have different elements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The attempted murder charge under Puerto Rico law, unlike the federal civil rights offense, requires proof that a defendant acted with the intent to kill or with the foreseeable consequence of causing death.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33 Secs. 3062, 4001 (1991);  People v. Betancourt Asencio, 110 P.R. Dec. 510 (1980).  Conversely, the federal civil rights charge in this case required proof of elements not required by the attempted murder charge, including a showing that the defendant acted under color of law.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 242.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only two charges that even vaguely resembled each other are the two just discussed.  The remaining charges--concealment of evidence under local law and the firearms violation under federal law--are not even arguably the same charge as each other or as either the attempted murder or civil rights charge.  In sum, Blockburger disposes of the double jeopardy claim, so the result would be the same even if Lopez Andino had never been decided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. As a fall-back position, Perez argues that under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the federal prosecution was barred because it required relitigation of factual issues resolved in Perez' favor during the Puerto Rico trial.  Perez suggests that his acquittal on murder charges was equivalent to a finding that he had not used unreasonable force, unreasonable force being the premise of the federal civil rights charge.  United States v. McQueeney, 674 F.2d 109, 113 (1st Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies in criminal cases, Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 443-44, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 1194-95, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970), the party to be precluded must have been the same as, or in privity with, the party who lost on that issue in the prior litigation.  United States v. Bonilla Romero, 836 F.2d 39, 42-44 (1st Cir.1987).  Perez makes no effort to adduce facts showing privity in this case between federal and Puerto Rico prosecutors, possibly because he thinks that his \"single sovereign\" argument establishes an identity between the two governments, an argument this court has previously rejected in Bonilla Romero itself.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But all this makes no difference to the outcome, for even assuming identity or privity among prosecutors, Perez has not shown that any fact previously determined in his favor in the local trial was relitigated in the federal case.  A defendant can be acquitted of attempted murder even if he used excessive force.  To be sure, Perez could have sought to show from the court records of the first trial that the excessive force issue, or some other issue critical in the federal trial, was actually tried and necessarily decided in his favor in the first case, but he has made no such showing here.  United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta, 957 F.2d 18, 23 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Perez says that the trial judge erred by instructing the jury, prior to closing argument by the government, to \"give close attention\" to the prosecutor.  The trial judge made no similar remark before defense counsel's closing, and Perez asserts that this discrepancy improperly \"carried the weight of the judge to one side of the balance.\"   Perez did not raise this issue in the district court when the discrepancy could easily have been corrected, so we review only for plain error.  United States v. Olivier-Diaz, 13 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The challenged remark was innocuous in isolation and could not have prejudiced the jury unless it were part of a pattern of remarks favoring the government.  No such pattern is alleged or apparent from the record.  Indeed, while discussing closing arguments generally, the judge admonished the jury to \"give your close attention to the [prosecution and defense] attorneys while they address you.\"   In the final charge, the judge told the jury that he had no opinion in the case and that anything suggesting otherwise should be disregarded.  We see no error, let alone plain error, in the challenged remark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Perez next asserts that the district court erred in not permitting the defense to offer the testimony of Sergeant Neftalie Hernandez Santiago to impeach the credibility of a government witness, officer Ricardo Nieves Lopez.  During cross-examination, Nieves conceded that fellow police officers, including Hernandez, had accused him of various incidents of misconduct.  Nieves maintained that these allegations were baseless and had been made only to retaliate for his testimony in Perez' previous trial.  The defense called officer Hernandez to elicit testimony that Nieves had engaged in the alleged misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court in excluding the Hernandez testimony referred to Fed.R.Evid. 608(b), which precludes extrinsic evidence of bad acts (other than convictions) to support or attack the credibility of a witness.  The notion underlying the rule is that while certain prior good or bad acts of a witness may constitute character evidence bearing on veracity, they are not evidence of enough force to justify the detour of extrinsic proof.  Thus, Rule 608(b) barred Hernandez' testimony insofar as it was offered to show that Nieves had a propensity to lie.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, Hernandez' testimony would not only have suggested that Nieves was of bad character but would also have contradicted Nieves' own denials on the witness stand.  Impeachment by contradiction is a recognized mode of impeachment not governed by Rule 608(b), 28 C. Wright &amp; V. Gold, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 6118, at 103 (1993), but by common-law principles.  United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 479-80 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 409, 126 L.Ed.2d 356 (1993).  But, again largely for reasons of efficiency, extrinsic evidence to impeach is only admissible for contradiction where the prior testimony being contradicted was itself material to the case at hand.  Id.  Here, Nieves' alleged misconduct was not material to Perez' guilt or innocence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Perez' brief says that Hernandez would also have testified that Nieves' reputation for veracity was poor.  Reputation evidence of this kind is sometimes admissible, Fed.R.Evid. 608(a), although its weight is usually quite limited--precisely because specific examples of untruthfulness cannot be elicited in support.  3 J. Weinstein, M. Berger &amp; J. McLaughlin, Weinstein's Evidence para. 608, at 608-28 (1995).  In all events, Perez did not advise the trial court of this facet of the proposed testimony, so the argument is effectively lost.  See Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. Finally, Perez claims that the trial court erred in declining to adjust his sentence downward two levels for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1.  Since this claim was not made in the district court, our review is limited to plain error.  Olivier-Diaz, 13 F.3d at 5.   In support of his claim, Perez offers only a statement in the presentence report indicating that he \"expressed remorse for his wrongdoing and accepted responsibility for same,\" although the probation officer ultimately concluded that Perez was not entitled to a downward adjustment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the record shows that Perez continued to deny responsibility for his crime at sentencing, stating that he lacked criminal intent at the time of the crimes and declaring his innocence.  Thus, there is no indication that the trial judge committed an error, let alone plain error, in denying a downward adjustment.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1(a).  Perez' further suggestion that the district court had to recite its reasons for denying the downward adjustment is mistaken;  the reasons were and are apparent from the record.  See United States v. Akitoye, 923 F.2d 221, 227 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

In support of his claim, Perez offers only a statement in the presentence report indicating that he \"expressed remorse for his wrongdoing and accepted responsibility for same,\" although the probation officer ultimately concluded that Perez was not entitled to a downward adjustment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the record shows that Perez continued to deny responsibility for his crime at sentencing, stating that he lacked criminal intent at the time of the crimes and declaring his innocence.  Thus, there is no indication that the trial judge committed an error, let alone plain error, in denying a downward adjustment.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1(a).  Perez' further suggestion that the district court had to recite its reasons for denying the downward adjustment is mistaken;  the reasons were and are apparent from the record.  See United States v.
