McIntyre,\r                                                                             \r\nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellees.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.   We  affirm the judgment  substantially for\r                           \r\n\nthe  reasons  recited in  the  district  court's decision  of\r\n\nNovember 10, 1994, adding only the following comments.\r\n\n     In  objecting to  the district  court's reliance  on the\r\n\nRooker-Feldman doctrine,  see Rooker  v. Fidelity  Trust Co.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n263 U.S. 413 (1923); District of Columbia Court of Appeals v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nFeldman, 460 U.S. 462 (1983), plaintiff argues that he is not\r                   \r\n\nseeking to overturn any state court judgment per se and that,\r\n\nin  fact, many of the challenges here advanced to the probate\r\n\ncourt  proceedings  were never  pursued  in  the state  court\r\n\nsystem.    The  Rooker-Feldman  doctrine  recognizes  that  a\r                                          \r\n\nfederal district court lacks appellate jurisdiction to review\r\n\na  state  court judgment.   See,  e.g.,  id. at  482-86; Gash\r                                                                         \r\n\nAssocs.  v.

Fay, 909 F.2d  15, 17  (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1990).  What  plaintiff fails to recognize is  that such\r\n\n\"impermissible appellate  review may  occur  when a  district\r\n\ncourt is asked  to entertain a claim that was not even argued\r\n\nin the state court but is 'inextricably intertwined' with the\r\n\nstate court judgment.\"   Ritter  v. Ross, 992  F.2d 750,  753\r                                                    \r\n\n(7th Cir.  1993) (quoting  Feldman, 460  U.S.  at 483  n.16),\r                                              \r\n\ncert.  denied,  114 S.  Ct. 694  (1994); accord,  e.g., Keene\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorp. v.  Cass, 908 F.2d  293, 296-97 (8th  Cir. 1990).   The\r                          \r\r\n\nmultiple claims here  presented--alleging violations of  such\r\n\nmatters  as due process,  equal protection, and  the right to\r\n\ncounsel--are  sufficiently  \"intertwined\"  with  the  probate\r\n\ncourt  proceedings so  as to  fall within  the Rooker-Feldman\r                                                                         \r\n\ndoctrine's embrace.   Plaintiff's remedy is  to appeal within\r\n\nthe state  court system and  then, if necessary,  to petition\r\n\nthe United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari.\r\n\n     We add that plaintiff's various allegations would falter\r\n\neven if the merits were to  be considered.  To list just some\r\n\nof  the  infirmities affecting  his complaint:   In  order to\r\n\nstate a cause of action under  the second clause of 42 U.S.C.\r\n\n   1985(2),  plaintiff  was required  to  allege class-based,\r\n\ninvidiously  discriminatory  animus,   see,  e.g.,  Hahn   v.\r                                                                    \r\n\nSargent, 523 F.2d 461, 469 (1st Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 425\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 904  (1976); divorced  fathers seeking custody  of their\r\n\nchildren  do not  form a  protected class  under   1985.   No\r\n\nSixth Amendment right to counsel obtains in civil proceedings\r\n\nof this nature.  See, e.g., Wilson v. State of New Hampshire,\r                                                                        \r\n\n18  F.3d 40, 41 (1st  Cir. 1994) (per  curiam).  Unauthorized\r\n\nconduct  that  cannot be  foreseen  and  controlled does  not\r\n\nconstitute  a due  process violation  \"until and  unless [the\r\n\nstate]  ...  refuses to  provide  a  suitable postdeprivation\r\n\nremedy,\"  Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 533 (1984); no such\r                                      \r\n\nshowing has been  made here.   With respect  to those  claims\r\n\nthat were  or  could  have been  presented  in  state  court,\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nrelitigation thereof would  be barred on preclusion  grounds.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Willhauck v.

The judicial defendants would be immune from most if\r\n\nnot  all of  the damage  claims here  presented.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nMireles v.  Waco, 502  U.S. 9 (1991)  (per curiam).

No Sixth Amendment right to counsel obtains in civil proceedings of this nature.  See, e.g., Wilson v. State of New Hampshire, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664625\"><a href=\"/opinion/664625/kenneth-e-wilson-v-state-of-new-hampshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir. 1994) (per curiam).  Unauthorized conduct that cannot be foreseen and controlled does not constitute a due process violation \"until and unless [the state] ... refuses to provide a suitable post-deprivation remedy,\" Hudson v.

With respect to those claims that were or could have been presented in state court, relitigation thereof would be barred on preclusion grounds.  See, e.g., Willhauck v.

The judicial defendants would be immune from most if not all of the damage claims here presented.  See, e.g., Mireles v.

And the Commonwealth and the probate court (along with the private defendants in their official capacities) are not \"persons\" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.  See, e.g., Hafer v.
