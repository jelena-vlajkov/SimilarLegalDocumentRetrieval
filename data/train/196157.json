Following  an earlier appeal in  which this\r                           \r\n\ncourt remanded for resentencing, see United States v.

This  time\r\n\naround, we find no error and thus summarily affirm.  See Loc.\r                                                                    \r\n\nR. 27.1.  \r\n\n     Defendant,  a real estate  broker and  financial adviser\r\n\nwho \"defrauded a number  of her friends, business associates,\r\n\nand former customers  out of more than $500,000,\"  Pelkey, 29\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d at 12, pled guilty in 1993 to three counts of mail fraud\r\n\nand one  count of wire fraud.   See 18 U.S.C.     1341, 1343.\r                                               \r\n\nAt the  original sentencing  on October  18, 1993,  the court\r\n\nimposed a prison  term of 43  months.  It first  calculated a\r\n\ntotal offense level  of 17,1 which  (with a criminal  history\r\n\ncategory of I) yielded a sentencing range of 24 to 30 months.\r\n\nThe  court  then  determined  that an  upward  departure  was\r\n\nwarranted  because  the  ten-level increase  mandated  by the\r\n\napplicable provision of  the fraud loss table did  not \"fully\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The total  offense level  was comprised of  the following\r\nelements: a base offense  level of six for fraud,  U.S.S.G.  \r\n2F1.1(a)  (1992);  plus  ten   levels  for  losses  exceeding\r\n$500,000, id.   2F1.1(b)(1); plus a two-level enhancement for\r                         \r\nmore than one  victim, id.   2F1.1(b)(2)(B); plus a two-level\r                                      \r\nenhancement for  vulnerable victim,  id.   3A1.1;  less three\r                                                    \r\nlevels for acceptance of responsibility, id.   3E1.1. \r                                                        \r\r\n\ncapture the harmfulness\" of  defendant's conduct.  U.S.S.G.  \r\n\n2F1.1, comment. (n.10) (1992).2  \r\n\n     In  support  of this  conclusion,  the  court cited  two\r\n\nfactors (with primary emphasis placed on the former): (1)  as\r\n\ndefendant  was or  should  have been  aware,  several of  the\r\n\nvictims  were elderly  individuals  who lost  most or  all of\r\n\ntheir  life  savings,  with   little  prospect  of  regaining\r\n\nfinancial  security;  and (2)  several  victims  had suffered\r\n\n\"extreme psychological  injury.\"   Suggesting  that the  real\r\n\nvalue  of the losses to the victims was closer to $10 million\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The 1992 version of application note 10 read in pertinent\r\npart as follows: \r\n\n     In  cases  in  which  the  loss   determined  under\r\n     subsection  (b)(1)  does   not  fully  capture  the\r\n     harmfulness  and  seriousness  of  the  conduct, an\r\n     upward departure  may be  warranted.   Examples may\r\n     include the following:\r\n          (a)  the  primary objective  of the  fraud was\r\n     non-monetary;\r\n          (b) false statements were made for the purpose\r\n     of facilitating some other crime;\r\n          (c)   the   offense    caused   physical    or\r\n     psychological harm;\r\n          (d) the offense  endangered national  security\r\n     or military readiness;\r\n          (e) the offense caused a loss of confidence in\r\n     an important institution.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    2F1.1, comment. (n.10)  (1992).  Effective  as of\r\nNovember 1, 1993, an amendment to note 10 added the following\r\nnew subdivision:\r\n\n          (f)   the   offense   involved   the   knowing\r\n     endangerment  of  the  solvency  of  one   or  more\r\n     victims.\r\n\nSee U.S.S.G., App. C., Amend. 482 (1993).\r               \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nthan to $500,000, the court departed upward by five levels to\r\n\na total offense level of 22.  The resulting 43-month sentence\r\n\nwas near the bottom of the revised sentencing range.\r\n\n     On  appeal,  we agreed  with  defendant  that the  cited\r\n\njustifications for the five-level departure  were inadequate.\r\n\nWith respect  to the court's  first rationale, we  noted that\r\n\n\"[t]he failure to  have a secure  financial future does  not,\r\n\nwithout more, rise to  the level of seriousness\" contemplated\r\n\nby  the   grounds  for   departure  listed  as   examples  in\r\n\napplication note  10.3  Pelkey, 29  F.3d at 15.   At the same\r                                          \r\n\ntime, we  acknowledged that there was  a distinction \"between\r\n\ndefrauding a 40-year-old of her life savings and defrauding a\r\n\n60-year-old  of  her savings.\"    Id.   That  distinction, we\r                                                 \r\n\nobserved, was at least partially reflected in the enhancement\r\n\nfor  vulnerable victim and would not, in any case, \"warrant a\r\n\nfive-level departure.\"   Id.  Yet  we specifically left  open\r                                        \r\n\nthe possibility that an upward departure might be appropriate\r\n\nif, on remand, \"the court were to make specific findings that\r\n\nsome  of the victims were unable to provide for their welfare\r\n\nor  that  the facts  present[ed]  a  situation  equal to  the\r\n\nserious caliber\"  of the examples listed  in application note\r\n\n10.   Id.  We also  referred to the intervening  amendment to\r                     \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  As to the  court's secondary rationale, we  held that the\r\nseverity of the psychological injury suffered  by defendant's\r\nvictims  was not  \"so  far beyond\"  that experienced  in \"the\r\nheartland of fraud cases\"  as to justify a departure  on such\r\nbasis.  Pelkey, 29 F.3d at 16. \r                          \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nnote  10  which  had  added  to  that  list  of  examples  by\r\n\nencouraging  a  departure  where  \"the  offense involved  the\r\n\nknowing endangerment of the solvency of one or more victims.\"\r\n\nId. at  15 n.5 (quoting U.S.S.G.    2F1.1, comment. (n.10(f))\r               \r\n\n(1993)).   We observed that  a departure on  this ground--one\r\n\nwhich required a finding that a defendant knowingly  pushed a\r                                                               \r\n\nvictim  into extreme financial hardship--\"seem[ed] to address\r\n\nthe type of harm the court was attempting to quantify.\"  Id.\r                                                                        \r\n\n     On  remand, after  receiving supplemental  evidence from\r\n\nthe  parties, the  court found  that defendant  had knowingly\r\n\nendangered  the  solvency of  several  of  her  victims.   It\r\n\ntherefore again departed upward, this  time by two levels, to\r\n\nreach  a total offense level  of 19.   The resulting 37-month\r\n\nsentence was within the revised sentencing range.  As she did\r\n\nbelow, defendant  now argues that  (1) reliance  on the  1993\r\n\namendment  to application note 10  violated the ex post facto\r                                                                         \r\n\nclause;  (2) consideration  of the  government's supplemental\r\n\naffidavits was  improper,  and  the  evidence  was  otherwise\r\n\ninsufficient  to   support  the  upward  departure;  and  (3)\r\n\ndeparting  upward due to the financial strain on the victims,\r\n\nin conjunction  with the  adjustment for  vulnerable victims,\r\n\nresulted  in  impermissible double-counting.   Each  of these\r\n\ncontentions, we conclude, misses the mark.\r\n\n                    Ex Post Facto Concerns\r                                                      \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n     \"To  avoid  ex post  facto  difficulties,  courts should\r                                           \r\n\n'normally apply [guideline] amendments retroactively  only if\r\n\nthey  clarify  a guideline,  but  not  if they  substantively\r\n\nchange  a guideline.'\"   United States  v. Rostoff,      F.3d\r                                                              \r\n\n   , No. 93-1376,  slip op.  at 12 (1st  Cir. 1995)  (quoting\r\n\nUnited  States v. Prezioso, 989 F.2d 52, 53 (1st Cir. 1993)).\r                                      \r\n\nDefendant argues that the  1993 amendment to application note\r\n\n10 effected such a substantive change.   This conclusion, she\r\n\nsuggests,  is  apparent from  the  language  employed by  the\r\n\nCommission, which  described this aspect of  the amendment as\r\n\none  that \"revises  the Commentary  to    2F1.1  by expanding\r                                                                         \r\n\nApplication Note 10 to provide guidance in cases in which the\r\n\nmonetary loss does not  adequately reflect the seriousness of\r\n\nthe offense.\"  U.S.S.G., App. C., Amend. 482 (1993) (emphasis\r\n\nadded).  The fact that other changes implemented by Amendment\r\n\n482  were  characterized  as  \"clarifying,\"  she  adds,  only\r\n\nreinforces this interpretation.\r\n\n     We  disagree.   The distinction between  a clarification\r\n\nand a substantive  revision of the  guidelines is not  always\r\n\n\"clear-cut,\"  Isabel v. United  States, 980 F.2d  60, 62 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir.  1992), and  the Commission's  language can  be read  to\r\n\nsupport  either view.4   Of greater  relevance, we  think, is\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  At one point, the district court appeared to suggest that\r\nthe amendment  could be  deemed clarifying simply  because it\r\ninvolved an application note  rather than a guideline proper.\r\nAny such suggestion was  incidental to the court's reasoning,\r\nand we have  no occasion  to address it  here--other than  to\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nthe fact that the examples listed in application note 10 were\r\n\n(and are) meant to be \"nonexclusive.\"  Pelkey, 29 F.3d at 14.\r                                                         \r\n\nAs we indicated in our  earlier decision, an upward departure\r\n\nbased on unusual  financial strain incurred  by a victim  was\r\n\npermissible even before the  1993 amendment.  See id.  at 15.\r                                                                 \r\n\nIndeed, other  courts have  upheld departures on  this ground\r\n\nbased on the pre-1993  version of application note 10.   See,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g., United States v. Kaye, 23 F.3d 50, 53-54 (2d Cir. 1994)\r                                       \r\n\n(affirming upward departure based on finding that defendant's\r\n\nfraud--depriving his great-aunt of her life savings--involved\r\n\na degree  of harm  not adequately considered  by Commission);\r\n\nUnited States  v.

Under these circumstances, retroactive application\r\n\nof the amendment  raises no  ex post facto  concerns.5   See,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g., United States  v.

On  remand,  over  defendant's\r                  \r\n\nobjection,  the district  court  permitted the  government to\r\n\nsupplement the record  with additional affidavits  from three\r\n\nof the  victims.6   Defendant now  insists that  the district\r\n\ncourt  exceeded the  scope of our  mandate by  permitting the\r\n\nevidentiary record to  be reopened.  Yet  our earlier opinion\r\n\nspecifically  contemplated  that  the  court might  make  new\r\n\nfindings of fact to support the upward departure.  See id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n15.  It was well within the court's discretion to permit both\r\n\nsides to  supplement the record in connection with this issue\r\n\nprior to its doing so.7  See, e.g., United States  v. Bell, 5\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 64,  66-67 (4th Cir. 1993).  The court on remand did not\r\n\nengage  in  a  fully  de novo  hearing  in  which  previously\r                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  These  victims, among others, had earlier provided victim\r\nimpact  statements  to  the  Probation   Office,  which  were\r\nrecounted at length in the presentence report.\r\n\n7.  The  defendant  declined  to  present  any  new  evidence\r\nregarding  the financial  solvency  issue, but  did take  the\r\nopportunity to buttress earlier evidence of rehabilitation.\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nforfeited  issues were  resuscitated,  see  generally  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Bell,  988 F.2d  247 (1st Cir.  1993);8 indeed,  it\r                          \r\n\ndeclined to  entertain a proposed  new sentencing enhancement\r\n\n(for  abuse of position of trust) not earlier advanced by the\r\n\ngovernment.   And  defendant's reliance  on United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nParker,  30 F.3d 542, 553-54 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nCt. 605 (1994), is misplaced, inasmuch as the government here\r\n\nwas  not afforded a second opportunity to prove an element of\r\n\nthe offense.  We thus see no error.9\r\n\n     Defendant's  secondary  contention in  this regard--that\r\n\nthe evidence was  insufficient to support a finding  that she\r\n\nknowingly  endangered the  solvency  of one  or  more of  her\r\n\nvictims--is advanced  only in  peremptory fashion and  can be\r\n\nsummarily rejected.   It suffices to note  the following: (1)\r\n\nthe Meuse/Laskey affidavit stated that defendant \"handled all\r\n\nof our financial matters\" and \"knew what we had right down to\r\n\nthe  last  penny  and  she  took  that  also\";  and  (2)  the\r\n\npresentence  report  indicated   that  LeClair  had  provided\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  Whether  a de novo hearing would have been proper in this\r                                  \r\nsituation,  of course,  is a  question not  before us.   See,\r                                                                        \r\ne.g., United States  v. Ortiz,  25 F.3d 934,  935 (10th  Cir.\r                                         \r\n1994).\r\n\n9.  Any  error in this regard would be harmless in any event.\r\nAs the  district court  observed, the finding  that defendant\r\nknowingly endangered the solvency of  one or more victims was\r\nreasonably  inferable  from  the  evidence  contained in  the\r\npresentence  report.   Indeed,  defendant acknowledged  below\r\nthat the new affidavits \"paraphrase[d]\" the victims'  earlier\r\nstatements \"almost completely.\" \r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\ndefendant  with  a copy  of  his assets  and  liabilities; he\r\n\nelaborated in his affidavit that defendant \"always knew about\r\n\nmy  financial situation and knew  that if she  didn't give me\r\n\nback the money, I would become insolvent.\"  Based on this and\r\n\nsubstantial other evidence, the district court's finding that\r\n\n\"the  departure-justifying   circumstance  actually  existed\"\r\n\ncannot  be  deemed  clearly  erroneous.

We implicitly rejected this argument in our\r\n\nearlier  decision, see Pelkey, 29  F.3d at 14-15,  as did the\r                                         \r\n\nCommission  in its  1993  amendment to  application note  10.\r\n\nWhile  the  two  matters  do overlap,  there  remains  a core\r\n\ndistinction: the vulnerable  victim adjustment focuses  on an\r\n\nindividual's susceptibility to becoming a victim of crime per\r\n\nse, whereas the note 10(f) departure focuses on the extent to\r\n\nwhich  a victim has suffered an unusual degree of harm from a\r\n\ncrime.  See, e.g., United States v. Kaye, 23 F.3d at 54.   As\r                                                    \r\n\nsuch,  \"the  vulnerable  victim  enhancement  does not  fully\r\n\ncapture  [the] concern with the actual impact of the fraud on\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nthe victim.\"  Id.

Pelkey, 29 F.3d 11 (1st Cir. 1994), the district court sentenced defendant Mae Linh Pelkey to a 37-month term of imprisonment.  Defendant again appeals, complaining (as she did earlier) of an upward departure undertaken by the court.  This time around, we find no error and thus summarily affirm.  See Loc.  R. 27.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant, a real estate broker and financial adviser who \"defrauded a number of her friends, business associates, and former customers out of more than $500,000,\" Pelkey, 29 F.3d at 12, pled guilty in 1993 to three counts of mail fraud and one count of wire fraud.  See 18 U.S.C. Secs. 1341, 1343.  At the original sentencing on October 18, 1993, the court imposed a prison term of 43 months.  It first calculated a total offense level of 17,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> which (with a criminal history category of I) yielded a sentencing range of 24 to 30 months.  The court then determined that an upward departure was warranted because the ten-level increase mandated by the applicable provision of the fraud loss table did not \"fully capture the harmfulness\" of defendant's conduct.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1, comment.  (n.10) (1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of this conclusion, the court cited two factors (with primary emphasis placed on the former):  (1) as defendant was or should have been aware, several of the victims were elderly individuals who lost most or all of their life savings, with little prospect of regaining financial security;  and (2) several victims had suffered \"extreme psychological injury.\"  Suggesting that the real value of the losses to the victims was closer to $10 million than to $500,000, the court departed upward by five levels to a total offense level of 22.  The resulting 43-month sentence was near the bottom of the revised sentencing range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, we agreed with defendant that the cited justifications for the five-level departure were inadequate.  With respect to the court's first rationale, we noted that \"[t]he failure to have a secure financial future does not, without more, rise to the level of seriousness\" contemplated by the grounds for departure listed as examples in application note 10.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Pelkey, 29 F.3d at 15.  At the same time, we acknowledged that there was a distinction \"between defrauding a 40-year-old of her life savings and defrauding a 60-year-old of her savings.\"  Id. That distinction, we observed, was at least partially reflected in the enhancement for vulnerable victim and would not, in any case, \"warrant a five-level departure.\"  Id. Yet we specifically left open the possibility that an upward departure might be appropriate if, on remand, \"the court were to make specific findings that some of the victims were unable to provide for their welfare or that the facts present[ed] a situation equal to the serious caliber\" of the examples listed in application note 10.  Id. We also referred to the intervening amendment to note 10 which had added to that list of examples by encouraging a departure where \"the offense involved the knowing endangerment of the solvency of one or more victims.\"  Id. at 15 n.5 (quoting U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1, comment.  (n.10(f)) (1993)).  We observed that a departure on this ground-one which required a finding that a defendant knowingly pushed a victim into extreme financial hardship-\"seem[ed] to address the type of harm the court was attempting to quantify.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, after receiving supplemental evidence from the parties, the court found that defendant had knowingly endangered the solvency of several of her victims.  It therefore again departed upward, this time by two levels, to reach a total offense level of 19.  The resulting 37-month sentence was within the revised sentencing range.  As she did below, defendant now argues that (1) reliance on the 1993 amendment to application note 10 violated the ex post facto clause;  (2) consideration of the government's supplemental affidavits was improper, and the evidence was otherwise insufficient to support the upward departure;  and (3) departing upward due to the financial strain on the victims, in conjunction with the adjustment for vulnerable victims, resulted in impermissible double-counting.  Each of these contentions, we conclude, misses the mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Ex Post Facto Concerns</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"To avoid ex post facto difficulties, courts should 'normally apply [guideline] amendments retroactively only if they clarify a guideline, but not if they substantively change a guideline.' \"  United States v. Rostoff, ___ F.3d ___, No. 93- 1376, slip op. at 12 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting United States v. Prezioso, 989 F.2d 52, 53 (1st Cir. 1993)).  Defendant argues that the 1993 amendment to application note 10 effected such a substantive change.  This conclusion, she suggests, is apparent from the language employed by the Commission, which described this aspect of the amendment as one that \"revises the Commentary to Sec. 2F1.1 by expanding Application Note 10 to provide guidance in cases in which the monetary loss does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense.\"  U.S.S.G., App.  C., Amend. 482 (1993) (emphasis added).  The fact that other changes implemented by Amendment 482 were characterized as \"clarifying,\" she adds, only reinforces this interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  The distinction between a clarification and a substantive revision of the guidelines is not always \"clear- cut,\" Isabel v. United States, 980 F.2d 60, 62 (1st Cir. 1992), and the Commission's language can be read to support either view.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Of greater relevance, we think, is the fact that the examples listed in application note 10 were (and are) meant to be \"nonexclusive.\"  Pelkey, 29 F.3d at 14.  As we indicated in our earlier decision, an upward departure based on unusual financial strain incurred by a victim was permissible even before the 1993 amendment.  See id. at 15.  Indeed, other courts have upheld departures on this ground based on the pre- 1993 version of application note 10.  See, e.g., United States v. Kaye, 23 F.3d 50, 53-54 (2d Cir. 1994) (affirming upward departure based on finding that defendant's fraud-depriving his great-aunt of her life savings-involved a degree of harm not adequately considered by Commission);  United States v. Stouffer, 986 F.2d 916, 927-28 (5th Cir.)  (affirming departure based on finding that fraud scheme caused thousands of investors to lose their life savings), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 115 (1993).  To a large extent, therefore, the 1993 amendment simply codified pre-existing practice.  Under these circumstances, retroactive application of the amendment raises no ex post facto concerns.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See, e.g., United States v. Fadayini, 28 F.3d 1236, 1242 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (applying application note 10(f) on retroactive basis, without mentioning ex post facto issue);  United States v. Strouse, ___ F. Supp. ___, 1995 WL 235568, at * 5 (M.D. Pa. 1995) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Evidentiary Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the earlier appeal, we vacated the sentence and remanded \"for resentencing consistent with this opinion.\"  Pelkey, 29 F.3d at 16.  On remand, over defendant's objection, the district court permitted the government to supplement the record with additional affidavits from three of the victims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Defendant now insists that the district court exceeded the scope of our mandate by permitting the evidentiary record to be reopened.  Yet our earlier opinion specifically contemplated that the court might make new findings of fact to support the upward departure.  See id. at 15.  It was well within the court's discretion to permit both sides to supplement the record in connection with this issue prior to its doing so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  See, e.g., United States v. Bell, 5 F.3d 64, 66-67 (4th Cir. 1993).  The court on remand did not engage in a fully de novo hearing in which previously forfeited issues were resuscitated, see generally United States v. Bell, 988 F.2d 247 (1st Cir. 1993);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> indeed, it declined to entertain a proposed new sentencing enhancement (for abuse of position of trust) not earlier advanced by the government.  And defendant's reliance on United States v. Parker, 30 F.3d 542, 553-54 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 605 (1994), is misplaced, inasmuch as the government here was not afforded a second opportunity to prove an element of the offense.  We thus see no error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's secondary contention in this regard-that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that she knowingly endangered the solvency of one or more of her victims-is advanced only in peremptory fashion and can be summarily rejected.  It suffices to note the following:  (1) the Meuse/Laskey affidavit stated that defendant \"handled all of our financial matters\" and \"knew what we had right down to the last penny and she took that also\";  and (2) the presentence report indicated that LeClair had provided defendant with a copy of his assets and liabilities;  he elaborated in his affidavit that defendant \"always knew about my financial situation and knew that if she didn't give me back the money, I would become insolvent.\"  Based on this and substantial other evidence, the district court's finding that \"the departure- justifying circumstance actually existed\" cannot be deemed clearly erroneous.

We implicitly rejected this argument in our earlier decision, see Pelkey, 29 F.3d at 14-15, as did the Commission in its 1993 amendment to application note 10.  While the two matters do overlap, there remains a core distinction:  the vulnerable victim adjustment focuses on an individual's susceptibility to becoming a victim of crime per se, whereas the note 10(f) departure focuses on the extent to which a victim has suffered an unusual degree of harm from a crime.  See, e.g., United States v. Kaye, 23 F.3d at 54.  As such, \"the vulnerable victim enhancement does not fully capture [the] concern with the actual impact of the fraud on the victim.\"  Id.

Examples may include the following:</p>\n        <p>(a) the primary objective of the fraud was non- monetary;</p>\n        <p>(b) false statements were made for the purpose of facilitating some other crime;</p>\n        <p>(c) the offense caused physical or psychological harm;</p>\n        <p>(d) the offense endangered national security or military readiness;</p>\n        <p>(e) the offense caused a loss of confidence in an important institution.</p>\n        <p>U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1, comment.  (n.10) (1992).

Pelkey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195491\"><a href=\"/opinion/195491/united-states-v-pelkey/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1994), the district court sentenced defendant Mae Linh Pelkey to a 37-month term of imprisonment.  Defendant again appeals, complaining (as she did earlier) of an upward departure undertaken by the court.  This time around, we find no error and thus summarily affirm.  See Loc.  R. 27.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant, a real estate broker and financial adviser who \"defrauded a number of her friends, business associates, and former customers out of more than $500,000,\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195491\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Pelkey,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195491/united-states-v-pelkey/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, pled guilty in 1993 to three counts of mail fraud and one count of wire fraud.  See 18 U.S.C. Secs. 1341, 1343.  At the original sentencing on October 18, 1993, the court imposed a prison term of 43 months.  It first calculated a total offense level of 17,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> which (with a criminal history category of I) yielded a sentencing range of 24 to 30 months.  The court then determined that an upward departure was warranted because the ten-level increase mandated by the applicable provision of the fraud loss table did not \"fully capture the harmfulness\" of defendant's conduct.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1, comment.  (n.10) (1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of this conclusion, the court cited two factors (with primary emphasis placed on the former):  (1) as defendant was or should have been aware, several of the victims were elderly individuals who lost most or all of their life savings, with little prospect of regaining financial security;  and (2) several victims had suffered \"extreme psychological injury.\"  Suggesting that the real value of the losses to the victims was closer to $10 million than to $500,000, the court departed upward by five levels to a total offense level of 22.  The resulting 43-month sentence was near the bottom of the revised sentencing range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, we agreed with defendant that the cited justifications for the five-level departure were inadequate.  With respect to the court's first rationale, we noted that \"[t]he failure to have a secure financial future does not, without more, rise to the level of seriousness\" contemplated by the grounds for departure listed as examples in application note 10.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195491\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Pelkey,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195491/united-states-v-pelkey/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>.  At the same time, we acknowledged that there was a distinction \"between defrauding a 40-year-old of her life savings and defrauding a 60-year-old of her savings.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195491\"><a href=\"/opinion/195491/united-states-v-pelkey/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> That distinction, </a></span>we observed, was at least partially reflected in the enhancement for vulnerable victim and would not, in any case, \"warrant a five-level departure.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195491\"><a href=\"/opinion/195491/united-states-v-pelkey/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Yet we </a></span>specifically left open the possibility that an upward departure might be appropriate if, on remand, \"the court were to make specific findings that some of the victims were unable to provide for their welfare or that the facts present[ed] a situation equal to the serious caliber\" of the examples listed in application note 10.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195491\"><a href=\"/opinion/195491/united-states-v-pelkey/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> We also </a></span>referred to the intervening amendment to note 10 which had added to that list of examples by encouraging a departure where \"the offense involved the knowing endangerment of the solvency of one or more victims.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195491\"><a href=\"/opinion/195491/united-states-v-pelkey/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 15 </a></span>n.5 (quoting U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1, comment.  (n.10(f)) (1993)).  We observed that a departure on this ground-one which required a finding that a defendant knowingly pushed a victim into extreme financial hardship-\"seem[ed] to address the type of harm the court was attempting to quantify.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, after receiving supplemental evidence from the parties, the court found that defendant had knowingly endangered the solvency of several of her victims.  It therefore again departed upward, this time by two levels, to reach a total offense level of 19.  The resulting 37-month sentence was within the revised sentencing range.  As she did below, defendant now argues that (1) reliance on the 1993 amendment to application note 10 violated the ex post facto clause;  (2) consideration of the government's supplemental affidavits was improper, and the evidence was otherwise insufficient to support the upward departure;  and (3) departing upward due to the financial strain on the victims, in conjunction with the adjustment for vulnerable victims, resulted in impermissible double-counting.  Each of these contentions, we conclude, misses the mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Ex Post Facto Concerns</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"To avoid ex post facto difficulties, courts should 'normally apply [guideline] amendments retroactively only if they clarify a guideline, but not if they substantively change a guideline.' \"  United States v. Rostoff, ___ F.3d ___, No. 93- 1376, slip op. at 12 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting United States v. Prezioso, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602838\"><a href=\"/opinion/602838/united-states-v-gabriel-prezioso/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir. 1993)).  Defendant argues that the 1993 amendment to application note 10 effected such a substantive change.  This conclusion, she suggests, is apparent from the language employed by the Commission, which described this aspect of the amendment as one that \"revises the Commentary to Sec. 2F1.1 by expanding Application Note 10 to provide guidance in cases in which the monetary loss does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense.\"  U.S.S.G., App.  C., Amend. 482 (1993) (emphasis added).  The fact that other changes implemented by Amendment 482 were characterized as \"clarifying,\" she adds, only reinforces this interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  The distinction between a clarification and a substantive revision of the guidelines is not always \"clear- cut,\" Isabel v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595487\"><a href=\"/opinion/595487/maurice-isabel-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir. 1992), and the Commission's language can be read to support either view.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Of greater relevance, we think, is the fact that the examples listed in application note 10 were (and are) meant to be \"nonexclusive.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195491\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Pelkey,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195491/united-states-v-pelkey/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>.  As we indicated in our earlier decision, an upward departure based on unusual financial strain incurred by a victim was permissible even before the 1993 amendment.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195491\"><a href=\"/opinion/195491/united-states-v-pelkey/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 15. </a></span> Indeed, other courts have upheld departures on this ground based on the pre- 1993 version of application note 10.  See, e.g., United States v. Kaye, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669105\"><a href=\"/opinion/669105/united-states-v-daniel-k-kaye/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 53-54 (2d Cir. 1994) (affirming upward departure based on finding that defendant's fraud-depriving his great-aunt of her life savings-involved a degree of harm not adequately considered by Commission);  United States v. Stouffer, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></span>, 927-28 (5th Cir.)

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span> </span>(1993).  To a large extent, therefore, the 1993 amendment simply codified pre-existing practice.  Under these circumstances, retroactive application of the amendment raises no ex post facto concerns.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See, e.g., United States v.

On remand, over defendant's objection, the district court permitted the government to supplement the record with additional affidavits from three of the victims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Defendant now insists that the district court exceeded the scope of our mandate by permitting the evidentiary record to be reopened.  Yet our earlier opinion specifically contemplated that the court might make new findings of fact to support the upward departure.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195491\"><a href=\"/opinion/195491/united-states-v-pelkey/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 15. </a></span> It was well within the court's discretion to permit both sides to supplement the record in connection with this issue prior to its doing so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  See, e.g., United States v. Bell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"652927\"><a href=\"/opinion/652927/united-states-v-george-robert-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 66-67 (4th Cir. 1993).  The court on remand did not engage in a fully de novo hearing in which previously forfeited issues were resuscitated, see generally United States v. Bell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602344\"><a href=\"/opinion/602344/united-states-v-richard-harmon-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1993);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> indeed, it declined to entertain a proposed new sentencing enhancement (for abuse of position of trust) not earlier advanced by the government.  And defendant's reliance on United States v. Parker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675123\"><a href=\"/opinion/675123/united-states-v-afnan-jerome-parker/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span>, 553-54 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span> </span>(1994), is misplaced, inasmuch as the government here was not afforded a second opportunity to prove an element of the offense.  We thus see no error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's secondary contention in this regard-that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that she knowingly endangered the solvency of one or more of her victims-is advanced only in peremptory fashion and can be summarily rejected.  It suffices to note the following:  (1) the Meuse/Laskey affidavit stated that defendant \"handled all of our financial matters\" and \"knew what we had right down to the last penny and she took that also\";  and (2) the presentence report indicated that LeClair had provided defendant with a copy of his assets and liabilities;  he elaborated in his affidavit that defendant \"always knew about my financial situation and knew that if she didn't give me back the money, I would become insolvent.\"  Based on this and substantial other evidence, the district court's finding that \"the departure- justifying circumstance actually existed\" cannot be deemed clearly erroneous.  United States v. Rostoff, ___ F.3d at ___, slip op. at 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Double-Counting</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we reject defendant's contention that undertaking an upward departure for financial impact on the victims, while simultaneously imposing a two-level enhancement for vulnerable victims, constituted impermissible double-counting.  We implicitly rejected this argument in our earlier decision, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195491\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Pelkey,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195491/united-states-v-pelkey/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>-15, as did the Commission in its 1993 amendment to application note 10.  While the two matters do overlap, there remains a core distinction:  the vulnerable victim adjustment focuses on an individual's susceptibility to becoming a victim of crime per se, whereas the note 10(f) departure focuses on the extent to which a victim has suffered an unusual degree of harm from a crime.  See, e.g., United States v. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669105\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Kaye,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/669105/united-states-v-daniel-k-kaye/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>.

As the district court observed, the finding that defendant knowingly endangered the solvency of one or more victims was reasonably inferable from the evidence contained in the presentence report.  Indeed, defendant acknowledged below that the new affidavits \"paraphrase[d]\" the victims' earlier statements \"almost completely.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
