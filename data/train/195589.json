Pro  se plaintiffs Patrick  Tracy and\n                    \n\nAedan   McCarthy  appeal  a   district  court  judgment  that\n\ndismissed their 42 U.S.C.  1983 complaint as frivolous within\n\nthe meaning  of 28  U.S.C.   1915(d).   Both plaintiffs  were\n\ninmates at the Kennebec County  Jail when they commenced this\n\naction and their complaint  named the Kennebec County Sheriff\n\nas the  sole  defendant.   The  complaint  alleged  that  the\n\nplaintiffs  were  being  denied  their rights  to  meaningful\n\naccess  to the courts because the law library at the Kennebec\n\nCounty Jail was \"totally  inadequate.\"  The plaintiffs sought\n\ninjunctive  relief in the form of an order requiring the jail\n\nto  bring the law library up  to the minimum standards set by\n\nthe American Association of Law Libraries.\n\n          By letter  dated March  2, 1994, Tracy  advised the\n\nclerk of this  court that  he had been  transferred from  the\n\nKennebec  County Jail  to another  jail.   We have  also been\n\nadvised that McCarthy now resides  at the Maine State  Prison\n\nin Thomaston.  As neither plaintiff is presently incarcerated\n\nat  the Kennebec  County  Jail, their  claims for  injunctive\n\nrelief  are moot.  Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed, the\n                                                        \n\ndistrict  court's  judgment  is  vacated,  and  the  case  is\n                                        \n\nremanded with directions to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint\n        \n\nas moot.
