Franklin  Delano  Lopez  was\r                                        \r\n\nconvicted  on seven  counts  charging him  with white  collar\r\n\ncriminal offenses  under federal law.   In this  appeal, able\r\n\ncounsel  on both sides have briefed a host of issues, several\r\n\nof which pose difficult and important questions.  We conclude\r\n\nby affirming on two counts and vacating  on five others.  The\r\n\ncase is remanded  for resentencing on the two affirmed counts\r\n\nand for retrial on  the five vacated counts, if sought by the\r\n\ngovernment.\r\n\n                        I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n     Lopez was tried under a  superseding indictment returned\r\n\non February 18, 1994.   Counts 1  through 5 charged him  with\r\n\nmaking false  representations to federally  insured banks, 18\r\n\nU.S.C.     1014,  to   influence  loans  to  Lopez   and  his\r\n\nbusinesses,   Four  Winds   Rental,  Inc.,   and  Multi-Media\r\n\nTelevision,  Inc.   Counts 6  and 7  charged Lopez  with wire\r\n\nfraud, 18 U.S.C.    1343, based on Lopez' withdrawal  of over\r\n\n$300,000  from  the  reserve  accounts   of  certain  limited\r\n\npartnerships managed by Lopez through Four Winds Rental, Inc.\r\n\nThe jury trial began on June 6, 1994.\r\n\n     The government's evidence on the first five counts aimed\r\n\nto show that Lopez  made false statements or submitted  false\r\n\ndocuments to obtain  loans, or extensions  of loans, on  five\r\n\noccasions.   Three  involved substantial  sums borrowed  from\r\n\nFirst Federal  Savings Bank;  another, a loan  extension from\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nChase Manhattan; and the last, a loan from Banco Central.  In\r\n\neach instance the alleged misinformation concerned  the value\r\n\nor  existence of collateral to secure the loan, and the facts\r\n\ndiffered in each instance.   No description of the  events is\r\n\nnecessary to our disposition of these false statement counts.\r\n\n     The two wire fraud charges, reflected in counts 6 and 7,\r\n\nrelated to  a different matter, namely,  Lopez' withdrawal of\r\n\nover  $300,000  from  reserve  accounts  of  certain  limited\r\n\npartnerships  that  owned  multi-unit,  federally  subsidized\r\n\nhousing  projects in Puerto Rico.  Four Winds managed and had\r\n\na  very small  ownership  interest in  each partnership,  the\r\n\nbalance being  held by other limited  partners represented by\r\n\nCapital Management Strategies,  Inc., a Rockville,  Maryland,\r\n\nreal estate syndicator.  The  properties were financed by the\r\n\nFarmers' Home Administration, which restricted the use of the\r\n\nfunds in the accounts to specific purposes, primarily repairs\r\n\nand improvements.\r\n\n     The  gist of  the government's  charge was that  in 1988\r\n\nLopez had withdrawn the sums in  question from these accounts\r\n\nwithout  the  required  permission   and  had  created  false\r\n\ninvoices  on  the letterhead  of  a  construction company  to\r\n\naccount for the withdrawals.  The government offered evidence\r\n\nthat Lopez had  created the invoices in  amounts matching the\r\n\nwithdrawals,  that no  such construction  work had  ever been\r\n\nperformed, and that  the invoices were  nevertheless supplied\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nto auditors to  explain the  withdrawals.   The wire  element\r\n\nrelated  to two  faxes, allegedly  sent  by Lopez  to Capital\r\n\nManagement Strategies in late 1990 and early 1991, responding\r\n\nto its  inquiry as to the purpose  of the withdrawals and the\r\n\nexistence  of  the  required   approvals  by  Farmers'   Home\r\n\nAdministration.\r\n\n     About two weeks into  the trial, on the evening  of June\r\n\n22,  1994, Lopez was rushed to a hospital emergency room with\r\n\nserious  symptoms.   Within  a  day,  the  trial  judge  took\r\n\ntestimony  from the  emergency  room internist  and,  shortly\r\n\nthereafter, heard from a court-appointed cardiologist.  Later\r\n\ntests revealed that Lopez was  suffering a small brain lesion\r\n\nor  tumor which was serious but, if properly treated, was not\r\n\nlikely to be life  threatening.  The doctors agreed  that the\r\n\ntumor had to  be removed but  not on an emergency  basis, and\r\n\nsurgery was scheduled for August.\r\n\n     These events caused a  recess of the trial from  June 22\r\n\nuntil July 6, at  which time a  hearing was held to  consider\r\n\nmotions by Lopez' counsel for a mistrial based on the lack of\r\n\ncompetency or  for a  continuance for purposes  of treatment.\r\n\nThe  thrust   of  Lopez'  objections  was   that  medications\r\n\nprescribed for  him caused side effects  that interfered with\r\n\nhis ability to proceed.  Relying partly on the  advice of the\r\n\ncourt-designated  neurologist, Dr.  Charles Payne,  the court\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\ndenied the motions,  and Dr. Payne  was ultimately placed  in\r\n\ncharge of prescribing medications.\r\n\n     The  same  objections  were thereafter  renewed  several\r\n\ntimes  but denied.   There were  further examinations  by Dr.\r\n\nPayne  and  testimony by  him  that  Lopez was  alert,  could\r\n\nunderstand the  charges and assist  his lawyers, and  was not\r\n\nbeing compromised  by the prescribed medications.   From July\r\n\n11  through July 13, Lopez testified in  his own defense.  On\r\n\nJuly  18,  the  jury convicted  Lopez  on  all  seven counts.\r\n\nThereafter, the  district court rejected  a post-trial motion\r\n\ndirected to competency.   It had earlier refused to  order an\r\n\ninvestigation  into alleged  prosecutorial misconduct  in the\r\n\ninitiating of the prosection.\r\n\n     Following  the   trial,  Lopez  remained  on   bail  and\r\n\nunderwent  surgery for the removal of the tumor.  On November\r\n\n17, 1994, Lopez  was sentenced to a prison term of 63 months,\r\n\nbased primarily  on loss calculations that  are challenged by\r\n\nLopez on  appeal.  Motions  for continuation of  bail pending\r\n\nappeal were denied by  the district court and by  this court.\r\n\nSee  18 U.S.C.    3143(b)(1)(B).  Lopez  is currently serving\r               \r\n\nhis sentence.\r\n\n                     II.  MEDICAL ISSUES\r\n\n     On this appeal, Lopez' first and  most dramatic claim is\r\n\nthat he was forced to continue his trial while afflicted with\r\n\na life-threatening  brain tumor  and while requiring  a whole\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nbattery of medications to cope with  various symptoms.  These\r\n\nmedications,  Lopez suggests, interfered  with his ability to\r\n\nremember,  concentrate  and  present  himself  credibly,  and\r\n\nundermined his trial testimony.  He further asserts that  the\r\n\ntrial  judge  effectively  compelled   him  to  accept   such\r\n\nmedications and, without basis,  charged him with malingering\r\n\nor  attempting to  over-medicate  in order  to frustrate  the\r\n\ntrial.\r\n\n     Although these  are  the core  factual allegations,  the\r\n\nlegal claim presented has  an unusual twist.  Lopez  does not\r                 \r\n\nclaim  that he  was \"incompetent\"  to  stand trial  under the\r\n\nordinary  rubric, see Godinez v. Moran, 113 S. Ct. 2680, 2685\r                                                  \r\n\n(1993), or that his health  would be so damaged by  the trial\r\n\nthat  it would  be inhumane  to continue.   Instead,  relying\r\n\nprimarily on  Riggins v. Nevada,  504 U.S. 127  (1992), Lopez\r                                           \r\n\nsays  that  the trial  court  \"instead  of  choosing  a  less\r\n\nintrusive  alternative--a halt  in  the proceedings  so  that\r\n\nLopez  could  have  surgery--violated  Lopez'  constitutional\r\n\nrights by imposing a `regime' of  medication that so impaired\r\n\nLopez'  abilities that he was unable to testify coherently on\r\n\nhis own behalf.\"\r\n\n     Riggins, which  the government says was  not relied upon\r                        \r\n\nin the district court, contains language  colorably pertinent\r\n\nto this  case, but involved a  fundamentally different issue.\r\n\nRiggins was tried  for murder and,  as eight Justices  viewed\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nthe  facts,  the trial  court  required  Riggins to  continue\r\n\ntaking a  powerful  antipsychotic drug  generically known  as\r\n\nthioridazine.  Riggins' claim to the Supreme Court, after his\r\n\nconviction and death sentence, was that he had been compelled\r\n\nunconstitutionally to take this  medication and that the drug\r\n\nconcealed his  true mental state  from the jury  and impaired\r\n\nhis ability to present his insanity defense.\r\n\n     The Supreme  Court held  that Riggins had  a substantial\r\n\ninterest  under  the Due  Process  Clause  of the  Fourteenth\r\n\nAmendment   in   \"avoiding   involuntary  administration   of\r\n\nantipsychotic drugs  . . . .\" Id. at 134.  Although the Court\r                                             \r\n\nsaid  that  forced  medication could  sometimes  be justified\r\n\n(e.g., to  protect the  defendant's health or  protect others\r                 \r\n\nfrom danger), the  trial judge  in Riggins had  made no  such\r                                                      \r\n\nfindings.     For   this  reason,   and  given   the  \"strong\r\n\npossibility\"  or  \"substantial  probability\"   that  Riggins'\r\n\ndefense had been impaired, id. at 137-38,  the Court declined\r                                          \r\n\nto require a showing  of actual prejudice and overturned  the\r\n\nconviction.\r\n\n     The  concern in  Riggins with  forced medication  is not\r                                         \r\n\npresent in this  case.   Although Lopez points  to the  trial\r\n\ncourt's  threat to  revoke bail  and imprison  him so  that a\r\n\ndoctor  could  supervise  his  medication,  the incident  had\r\n\nnothing  to do with forcing  on Lopez any  medication that he\r\n\ndid  not want.   The  trial court  thought that  some of  the\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nsymptoms of which  Lopez was  complaining (e.g.,  grogginess)\r                                                           \r\n\nhad been induced  by over-medication; at the outset  a number\r\n\nof doctors  were prescribing different  drugs, and  testimony\r\n\nshowed  that  over-medication  might  be the  cause  of  such\r\n\nproblems.  The record shows  that Lopez himself wanted proper\r\n\nmedicationandwascontent tohaveDr.Payneprescribe andsupervise.\r\n\n     This does  not mean  that Lopez  is without a  potential\r\n\nclaim.  That claim, made below and  adequately presented here\r\n\nin  the  course  of   the  Riggins  argument,  is  that   the\r                                              \r\n\nmedications,  necessary even  if voluntarily  taken, impaired\r\n\nLopez'  ability to present his defense.  Even assuming Lopez'\r\n\n\"competency,\"  that  being a  fairly  easy  test to  satisfy,\r\n\nGodinez,  113  S.  Ct.  at  2685,  the  threat  of impairment\r                   \r\n\npermitted a request  for a continuance.   Here, Lopez argues,\r\n\nthe district  court had a reasonable  alternative that should\r\n\nhave been adopted,  namely, to postpone  the trial until  the\r\n\noperation had occurred and removed or diminished the need for\r\n\ndrugs.\r\n\n     A  defendant,  especially  one proposing  to  testify at\r\n\ntrial about complex financial transactions, is entitled to be\r\n\nconcerned about his fitness.  For good medical reasons, Lopez\r\n\nwas  taking  a  number  of  medications,  some    capable  of\r\n\nproducing  side effects  that could  impair clarity  of mind.\r\n\nThe drugs  were designed  to prevent seizures,  control blood\r\n\npressure,  relieve pain,  induce sleep, reduce  agitation and\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nprevent  depression;  and  they  included  Darvocet,  ProSom,\r\n\nDilantin,  Vasotec,  Valium, Esgic  Plus  and  Sinequan.   At\r\n\nvarious times  Lopez reported  that he had  severe headaches,\r\n\nwas unable to  sleep, and was  suffering from memory  lapses.\r\n\nHis lawyers protested that  Lopez had problems  communicating\r\n\nwith them.\r\n\n     Lopez'  health obviously  warranted  an  inquiry by  the\r\n\ntrial  judge.  Far from  ignoring the issue,  the trial court\r\n\ndeferred trial  for  a substantial  period, summoned  medical\r\n\nexperts one after  another, took an  active role in  securing\r\n\ndiagnoses for Lopez, had him re-examined repeatedly, and took\r\n\ntestimony  and   made  findings  in  abundance,  including  a\r\n\ndetailed  post-trial order  summarizing the  court's findings\r\n\nand reasons for  proceeding with trial.  There is  no need to\r\n\ndescribe the procedural steps in detail because Lopez himself\r\n\ndoes not seriously suggest  that the investigation was flawed\r\n\nor inadequate.\r\n\n     The substantive issue is  more difficult.  The testimony\r\n\nof  the various doctors confirms  that a number  of the drugs\r\n\nLopez took have the  potential to cause side effects  such as\r\n\ngrogginess that  could interfere with defendant's  ability to\r\n\npresent  his case.    Yet the  main  thrust of  the  doctors'\r\n\ntestimony,  fairly read,  was that  the doctors  thought that\r\n\nproper prescription  and careful monitoring  would meet these\r\n\nthreats.   Such a monitoring  regime was in  place when Lopez\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\ntestified.  The doctors  who gave testimony raising  the most\r\n\ndoubts did  so  at the  outset  (while several  doctors  were\r\n\nprescribing   drugs  for   Lopez,  apparently   without  much\r\n\ncoordination).\r\n\n     Lopez' main trial counsel did  protest at times that his\r\n\nclient was not able to cooperate fully; but  these complaints\r\n\nof  Lopez'   conduct  during  trial  are   balanced,  if  not\r\n\noutweighed,  by  the  district  court's findings  that  Lopez\r\n\nappeared  to  be  well  oriented  and  was  cooperating  with\r\n\ncounsel.  In all events, a reputable expert unaffiliated with\r\n\nthe  prosecution or  defense--Dr. Payne--gave  firm testimony\r\n\nthat Lopez  was fit to  testify.  His testimony  was based on\r\n\nexaminations  of Lopez close in time and on the monitoring of\r\n\nhis medicine.  Even  on a cold record, Dr.  Payne's testimony\r\n\ncarries conviction.\r\n\n     As for  Lopez' own  testimony, which he  claims suffered\r\n\nbecause   of  his   medical   condition,  the   evidence   is\r\n\ninconclusive.   It is not  the most organized  and responsive\r\n\ntestimony  we  have  ever read;  but  Lopez  was confined  by\r\n\nevidentiary   rulings   that   limited   him   in  presenting\r\n\ninformation that he  and his counsel thought  helpful but the\r\n\ntrial  judge thought  irrelevant (e.g.,  such as  whether the\r                                                  \r\n\nbanks  had sustained actual losses).  Much of the disarray in\r\n\nhis testimony appears to be caused by such  struggles between\r\n\nLopez and the court.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\n     We  have no doubt that Lopez in addition was under great\r\n\nstress.   This  is true  for  many criminal  defendants,  but\r\n\nsurely  it  was augmented  here  by  the  tumor.   In  a  few\r\n\ninstances  Lopez' initial medication caused some adverse side\r\n\neffects while it  was being adjusted.  On the other hand, the\r\n\ntrial had already progressed  for several weeks before Lopez'\r\n\nemergency room visit, and much of the medication was directed\r\n\nto  medical  symptoms--difficulty  in  sleeping,  high  blood\r\n\npressure,  anxiety--that could easily  have continued even if\r\n\nthe  trial had  been  delayed and  the  tumor removed.    The\r\n\nmedical advice itself  largely supported the  course followed\r\n\nby the district court.\r\n\n     This is  a classic instance in which  the district court\r\n\nhad to exercise  its informed  judgment.  In  such cases,  so\r\n\nlong as  sound procedures are followed,  the court's ultimate\r\n\njudgment is  reviewed under an abuse  of discretion standard.\r\n\nUnited  States v. Zannino, 895  F.2d 1, 13  (1st Cir.), cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied,  494 U.S. 1082 (1990).   Whether to  proceed with the\r                  \r\n\ntrial  or await  the  operation may  well  have been  a  hard\r\n\nquestion.  But on appeal,  we think it easy to conclude  that\r\n\nthe trial judge acted within his discretion in deciding, with\r\n\nexpert medical support  and after  careful investigation,  to\r\n\nproceed.\r\n\n     We  reject the  suggestion that  the district  court was\r\n\nhostile  to the defendant.   Most judges are  suspicious of a\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nmid-trial  request for  a  continuance or  mistrial, and  the\r\n\nrecord confirms  that Lopez'  initial symptoms may  have been\r\n\ncaused in part by over-medication, even if inadvertent or the\r\n\nproduct  of too many doctors.  Paragons may exist among trial\r\n\njudges who can maintain perfect discipline with perfect tact;\r\n\nbut  for most, a certain  sternness in manner  and an abiding\r\n\nskepticism about delay are a necessary part of the arsenal.\r\n\n                       III.  THE MERITS\r\n\n     Counts 1-5.   The  first five  counts of  the indictment\r                           \r\n\ncharged  Lopez  under  a  statute that  punishes  anyone  who\r\n\n\"knowingly makes any false statement\"  to influence federally\r\n\ninsured financial  institutions.   18  U.S.C.    1014.    The\r\n\nindictment  charged, and  the  district court  assumed,  that\r\n\nmateriality  was  an element  of the  offense.   But,  as was\r\n\ncommonly done in most  circuits at the time, the  trial judge\r\n\nresolved the materiality issue himself  and did not submit it\r\n\nto the jury.  The defense objected to this procedure.\r\n\n     Following  Lopez' conviction, the  Supreme Court decided\r\n\nUnited States v. Gaudin, 115 S.  Ct. 2310 (1995).  There, the\r                                   \r\n\nCourt  held  that where  materiality  is  an  element  of  an\r\n\noffense,  it must under  the Sixth Amendment  be submitted to\r\n\nthe jury.  The  government's main response to Gaudin  is that\r                                                                \r\n\nmateriality   is  not   an   element   under  section   1014.\r\n\nAlternatively,  the  government  says   that  any  error  was\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\nharmless   because   the   evidence   overwhelmingly   proved\r\n\nmateriality and no rational jury could have found otherwise.\r\n\n     This court  has already held that  section 1014 requires\r\n\n\"that the  false statement concern[] a  material fact. United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Concemi, 957 F.2d 942,  951 (1st Cir. 1992).   This\r                             \r\n\nview is consistent with that of several other circuits.  E.g.\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v.  Wells, 63  F.3d 745, 750  (8th Cir.  1995);\r                                   \r\n\nUnited  States v. Staniforth,  971 F.2d 1355,  1358 (7th Cir.\r                                        \r\n\n1992).   Although  the statute  does not contain  an explicit\r\n\nmateriality requirement and the  Second Circuit has held that\r\n\nno such  requirement  is to  be  inferred, United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nCleary, 565 F.2d  43, 46  (2d Cir. 1977),  cert. denied,  435\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S. 915 (1978), we are  not disposed to regard the  issue as\r\n\nan open one in this circuit. \r\n\n     The government's alternative position is  that any error\r\n\nthat occurred in  failing to submit the issue to the jury was\r\n\nharmless.   Most errors, including  constitutional ones,  are\r\n\nsubject  to harmless  error analysis, Sullivan  v. Louisiana,\r                                                                        \r\n\n113  S. Ct.  2078, 2081  (1993), simply  because it  makes no\r\n\nsense  to retry a  case if the  result will  assuredly be the\r\n\nsame.   But for various reasons, some errors are deemed fatal\r\n\nwithout proof of prejudice.  No one, for example, would think\r\n\nit was harmless error--no  matter how conclusive the evidence\r\n\nof guilt--if  the defendant were tried by a jury of five year\r\n\nolds or in a courtroom dominated by a lynch-mob.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\n     The Supreme Court has  gone somewhat beyond such extreme\r\n\ncases, holding  (for  example) that  a  defective  reasonable\r\n\ndoubt  instruction objected  to at  trial cannot  be harmless\r\n\nerror. Id. at  2082-83.   The precedents make  clear that  it\r                      \r\n\ncould not be harmless error for  the trial judge to direct  a\r\n\nverdict on the case as a whole, United States v. Martin Linen\r                                                                         \r\n\nSupply, Co., 430 U.S.  564, 572-73 (1977); and we  think that\r                       \r\n\nthe Court would apply the same analysis to a directed verdict\r\n\non a single element of the  offense.  Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n570, 581 n.  8 (1986); Hoover  v. Garfield Heights  Municipal\r                                                                         \r\n\nCourt,  802 F.2d 168,  177-78 (6th Cir.  1986), cert. denied,\r                                                                        \r\n\n480 U.S. 949 (1987).\r\n\n     We  stress that it is  of crucial importance  to us that\r\n\nLopez made a timely objection at trial to the judge's refusal\r\n\nto submit this  issue to the  jury.  This  court has  already\r\n\nindicated that where there is no timely objection, the \"plain\r\n\nerror\"  doctrine (see United States v. Olano, 13 S. Ct. 1770,\r                                                        \r\n\n1777-78 (1993)),  governs  in  deciding  whether  failure  to\r\n\nsubmit an element  to the  jury calls for  reversal.   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Romero, 32 F.3d 641, 652 (1st Cir. 1994).

Ct. at  2322 (Rehnquist,  C.J., concurring).\r                  \r\n\nThe mix  of considerations is very different  where the trial\r\n\njudge  has not  been alerted  by an  objection.   Indeed, the\r\n\nelement  may  be one  that the  defendant  has chosen  not to\r\n\ncontest.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\n     Even where a timely  objection has been made, as  in our\r\n\nown case,  one might ask why the failure to submit an element\r\n\nto the  jury should  automatically be  fatal, given  that the\r\n\nharmless  error   doctrine  can   be   invoked  (not   always\r\n\nsuccessfully)   in  kindred   cases,   say,   to   remedy   a\r\n\nmisinstruction  as to an element, Pope  v. Illinois, 481 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n497, 502 (1987), or  a faulty presumption, Rose, 478  U.S. at\r                                                           \r\n\n579-80.   But  labels like  \"fundamental,\"  id. at  577,  and\r                                                           \r\n\n\"structural,\"  Sullivan,  113  S.

In theory, the\r\n\nquestion of purpose (the defendant's specific intent) differs\r\n\nfrom the question of materiality (whether an objective lender\r\n\nwould  be likely to be influenced by the statement).  Purpose\r\n\ncould exist without materiality, and vice versa.  But in most\r\n\ncases no  independent proof exists of  a defendant's specific\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\nintent; rather, the  jury infers such  purpose from the  fact\r\n\nthat the statement would so influence an ordinary lender.\r\n\n     The government hints  at this argument in  its brief but\r\n\nmakes no effort to show that in this case the  jury must have\r\n\nso reasoned, a  conclusion that might require  a showing both\r\n\nthat the  evidence of  materiality was overwhelming  and that\r\n\nother evidence of purpose was thin or absent.  If an adequate\r\n\nshowing were made, we  would have to decide whether  it would\r\n\nsatisfy the Supreme  Court.   There is some  reason to  think\r\n\nthat it might, see Sullivan, 113 S. Ct. at 2082,  but it will\r                                       \r\n\nbe time enough to consider this  question in a case where the\r\n\nfactual predicate is adequately developed.\r\n\n     Counts  6 and  7.   Lopez'  attacks  on the  wire  fraud\r                                 \r\n\nconvictions remain to  be considered.  In  his opening brief,\r\n\nLopez challenged the wire fraud convictions on three grounds:\r\n\nthat the evidence  did not show a scheme to defraud; that the\r\n\nuse of the  wires was not  in furtherance  of such a  scheme;\r\n\nthat  in  any  event  there  was  no  proof  that  Lopez  was\r\n\nresponsible for any such  use of the wires.   We address  the\r\n\npoints in the same order.\r\n\n     First, Lopez says  that the evidence does  not show that\r\n\nthere was a scheme to defraud.  He argues that the government\r\n\ndid not show  that the withdrawals from  the reserve accounts\r\n\nwere  diverted to his personal use or that they were directly\r\n\nlinked   to  the  false  invoices;   and  he  says  that  the\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n\npartnerships owed  him money in excess  of anything withdrawn\r\n\nand  that as a general  partner he had  authority to withdraw\r\n\nfunds.  These arguments peel  apart into distinct factual and\r\n\nlegal issues.\r\n\n     Starting with the facts,  the government apparently  did\r\n\nnot prove at  trial where the withdrawn  money went.  But  it\r\n\ndid show that Lopez'  withdrawals matched false construction-\r\n\ncompany invoices  in  the same  amounts  and that  Lopez  had\r\n\nprepared  the invoices,  together  with false  checks on  the\r\n\naccounts  purporting  to  pay  the invoices.    Absent  other\r\n\nevidence, the  jury  was entitled  to  infer that  Lopez  had\r\n\nemployed the false documents  to disguise the withdrawals and\r\n\ndivert them to  his own use.  This is enough  for a scheme to\r\n\ndefraud without proof  as to where he  concealed the proceeds\r\n\nor how  he spent the money. Cf.  United States v. Yefsky, 994\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 885, 892 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n     As for  the legal defenses, Lopez  as manager apparently\r\n\ncould  withdraw  funds  for  proper purposes,  but  the  jury\r\n\nreasonably concluded that the purpose here  was illicit.  Nor\r\n\nis it  pertinent that  the partnerships may  have owed  Lopez\r\n\nmoney.   The  accounts in  question here  were restricted  to\r\n\nrepairs  and  other narrow  uses;  and,  more important,  the\r\n\nrecords Lopez created gave the  impression that the money had\r\n\nbeen used for repairs.  The scheme, if successful, would have\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n\nenriched   Lopez  without  reducing  the  ventures'  apparent\r                                     \r\n\nobligations to Lopez.\r\n\n     Second, Lopez says  that the evidence did  not show that\r\n\nthe wires--the basis  for federal jurisdiction--were  used in\r\n\nfurtherance  of  the  scheme.    The  money,  he  notes,  was\r\n\nwithdrawn  in 1988;  and the  faxes, responding  to inquiries\r\n\nabout the withdrawals,  occurred in late 1990 and early 1991.\r\n\nLopez concludes that if any fraud occurred,  it was completed\r\n\nlong before the faxes were ever  sent.  No other use of wires\r\n\nwas alleged.\r\n\n     The case law requires that the  use of the wires must be\r\n\n\"incident to  an essential  part of  the scheme,\"  Pereira v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nUnited  States 347  U.S.  1, 8  (1954),  but the  cases  have\r                          \r\n\nstretched  that  concept  to  include use  of  the  wires  in\r\n\nattempts  \"`to  lull  the  victims  into  a  sense  of  false\r\n\nsecurity,   postpone  their   ultimate   complaint   to   the\r\n\nauthorities,  and  therefore  make  the  apprehension  of the\r\n\ndefendants less  likely.'\"  United  States v. Lane,  474 U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n438, 451-52 (1986) (quoting an earlier decision).  It is hard\r\n\nto  see why the  jury could not  find that the  faxes in this\r\n\ncase do not fit that description.\r\n\n     Lopez says that the faxes do not explicitly refer to the\r\n\nwithdrawals and that they  refer to events after 1988  and so\r\n\ncould not justify the  withdrawals.  But the faxes  were sent\r\n\nin response to  inquiries that did  refer to the  withdrawals\r                                              \r\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\nand it  is not a complete  answer to say that  the faxes were\r\n\nnot  directly  responsive  to  the inquiries.    Rather,  the\r\n\nresponses could be read as attempts to talk around the issue,\r\n\nto  confuse  matters,  and   ultimately  to  delay  or  avoid\r\n\ndetection.   This  permissible inference  satisfies  the Lane\r                                                                         \r\n\ncriterion.\r\n\n     Third, Lopez  says that  the government failed  to prove\r\n\nthat he  sent the  December 1990  fax (count  6) or that  the\r\n\nJanuary 1991 document (count 7) was transmitted by wire.  The\r\n\nformer was sent from  the accounting firm used by  Four Winds\r\n\nRental and an  accountant testified that he faxed  the letter\r\n\nas a  \"courtesy for .  . . Mr.  Lopez\" because \"either  he or\r\n\nsomeone from his office was in--in our office that day.\"  The\r\n\nletter  is  not  signed  but the  accompanying  cover  sheet,\r\n\nprepared by the accounting firm, says that the letter is from\r\n\nLopez.\r\n\n     Quite  apart from the  cover sheet,  the content  of the\r\n\nletter reveals that it is a response to the earlier letter of\r\n\ninquiry to Lopez.  The wording of the letter is substantially\r\n\nthe  same as the subsequent letter of January 14, 1991, which\r\n\nwas signed by Lopez.  It  was a fair inference that Lopez had\r\n\nalso  composed the  earlier  letter and  either directed  the\r\n\naccountant to  fax it or sent someone in his employ to do so.\r\n\nAll that  is required is that  Lopez caused the  letter to be\r\n\nfaxed and the jury could find that he did.\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                         -19-\r\r\n\n     As  for  the January  1991 letter,  Lopez does  not deny\r\n\nauthorship  but questions the  proof that it  had been faxed.\r\n\nThe  letter was  found  in the  files  of Capital  Management\r\n\nStrategies together with a  page bearing the phrases \"Telefax\r\n\nCommunication\"  and \"Fax  Cover Sheet\"  as well  as the  Four\r\n\nWinds  logo; and the page  describes Lopez as  the sender and\r\n\nbears  the same  date  as  the  letter.    This  is  adequate\r\n\ncircumstantial  evidence  that  the  document was  faxed  and\r\n\nserves to  distinguish United  States v. Srulowitz,  785 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n382 (2d  Cir. 1986), where no  circumstantial evidence showed\r\n\nthat a  letter found in  a file  had been mailed  to a  third\r\n\nparty.\r\n\n     Lopez  contends  in  his  reply brief  that  the  Gaudin\r                                                                         \r\n\ndecision also  requires reversal of his  convictions for wire\r\n\nfraud.  The government charged that Lopez had used interstate\r\n\nwires in furtherance  of a scheme to obtain money by means of\r\n\nfalse representations,  thereby violating 18  U.S.C.    1343.\r\n\nLopez says  that such false representations  must be material\r\n\nand that it was error not to so instruct the jury and require\r\n\nit  to find materiality.  The government says that this issue\r\n\nwas  not preserved, but Gaudin  is a recent  and not entirely\r                                          \r\n\npredictable decision.\r\n\n     On the  merits,  Lopez' argument  confronts  an  initial\r\n\ndifficulty.  In United  States v. Faulhaber, 929 F.2d  16, 18\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1991), this  court found no materiality requirement\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                         -20-\r\r\n\nin the substantially identical federal mail fraud statute, 18\r\n\nU.S.C.   1341, stating that the jury was not required to find\r\n\nthat the  scheme would have  defrauded a person  of \"ordinary\r\n\nprudence and comprehension.\"  Faulhaber's position is at odds\r                                                   \r\n\nwith some circuits and with  both of the standard instruction\r\n\ntreatises. E.g.,  United States v.  Dunn, 961  F.2d 648,  651\r                                                    \r\n\n(7th  Cir. 1992); 1A  L. Sand, J.  Siffert, W. Loughlin  &amp; S.\r\n\nReiss, Modern Federal Jury Instructions   44.01  (1995).  But\r                                                   \r\n\nwhether  Faulhaber warrants re-examination  is a  subject for\r                              \r\n\nanother occasion.\r\n\n     In  our case, the  district court did  instruct the jury\r                                                      \r\n\nthat a \"scheme to  defraud\" required that the \"plan  [be one]\r\n\nreasonably calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence\r\n\nand comprehension by means  of false or fraudulent pretenses,\r\n\nrepresentations, or promises.\"   This  language embodies  the\r\n\nmateriality standard.    The only  deceptive conduct  charged\r\n\nunder counts 6 and 7 involved false  or fraudulent documents,\r\n\nso  it hardly  matters that  the \"reasonably  calculated\" and\r\n\n\"ordinary  prudence\"  language  referred to  the  word \"plan\"\r\n\nrather  than the false  statements.  In  short, assuming that\r\n\nmateriality  is  an element  in  wire  fraud, the  issue  was\r\n\neffectively submitted to the jury in this case.\r\n\n                  IV.  GOVERNMENT MISCONDUCT\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                         -21-\r\r\n\n     Before trial, Lopez  filed a motion alleging  government\r\n\nmisconduct and  seeking to have the  indictment dismissed, or\r\n\nat least  to obtain  additional discovery and  an evidentiary\r\n\nhearing.   He claimed that he was  a victim of vindictive and\r\n\nselective  prosecution  and  that  the  indictment  had  been\r\n\ntainted by a  conflict of interest  on the  part of a  former\r\n\nAssistant United States  Attorney who had played a minor role\r\n\nin the investigation of  Lopez and later served for  a period\r\n\nas Lopez'  defense counsel prior to indictment.  The district\r\n\ncourt denied this  motion.   United States v.  Lopez, 854  F.\r                                                                \r\n\nSupp. 41 (D.P.R. 1994).\r\n\n     We start with the claim  of improper prosecution.  Lopez\r\n\ntold the  district court that he had  been prosecuted because\r\n\nhe refused to  use his  political influence in  favor of  the\r\n\nreappointment  of a  former  U.S. Attorney  for Puerto  Rico.\r\n\nFurther,  he  claimed that  defendants  in  his position  are\r\n\nnormally pursued  civilly on  false statement claims,  so the\r\n\nprosecution  was  selective  as  well  as  vindictive.    His\r\n\nevidence  on the  first point  was thin;  on the  second, the\r\n\ngovernment offered  the district  court evidence  that Lopez'\r\n\ncase did fall within its guidelines for criminal prosecutions\r\n\nbecause of the amounts involved.\r\n\n     On appeal, Lopez has condensed his argument on the claim\r\n\nof improper prosecution to  a couple of sentences and  a pair\r\n\nof  footnotes.  The arguments are used primarily to add color\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                         -22-\r\r\n\nto his other claim of government  misconduct, relating to the\r                        \r\n\ndual role of  the lawyer who allegedly represented  first the\r\n\ngovernment  and then Lopez in the same matter.  Arguments not\r\n\nseriously developed  on appeal are waived,  Zannino, 895 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\nat 17, and  in this instance we also think that a deliberate,\r\n\nand reasonable, strategy choice was made.\r\n\n     Nevertheless,  those charges of selective and vindictive\r\n\nprosecution indirectly concern the integrity  of the judicial\r\n\nprocess.   We have therefore reviewed with care the pertinent\r\n\nfilings in  the district court, the  district court's lengthy\r\n\ndiscussion of the subject, what little Lopez has to say about\r\n\nthe  matter on  appeal, and  the government's  more extensive\r\n\nrebuttal.  Although the waiver relieves us of the need to set\r\n\nout the facts in detail, we comment briefly on each branch of\r\n\nLopez' claim.\r\n\n     The district court did not ignore the serious charges of\r\n\nblackmail made against certain members of the U.S. Attorney's\r\n\noffice, but  analyzed the proffered evidence with care.  This\r\n\nevidence consisted primarily of  hearsay and conjecture,  and\r\n\nthe district  court after  scrutiny found it  insufficient to\r\n\nrequire an evidentiary hearing.   Lopez, 854 F. Supp.  at 45-\r                                                   \r\n\n46.  The district court's judgment call was not  unreasonable\r\n\non  its  face,  especially   where  as  here  the  vindictive\r\n\nprosecution claim falls outside the narrow area where  such a\r\n\nclaim traditionally has  been recognized, e.g.  United States\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -23-\r                                         -23-\r\r\n\nv. Garza-Juarez, 992  F.2d 896,  905 (9th  Cir. 1992),  cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied,  114 S.  Ct. 724  (1994),  and where  the prosecution\r                  \r\n\nitself was conducted by a new U.S. Attorney not implicated by\r\n\nLopez' allegations.\r\n\n     As for selective prosecution,  the district court  asked\r\n\nthe government for information  about its prosecution policy.\r\n\nThe government  supplied the  data and  the court ruled  that\r\n\nLopez  had not made  out a colorable  claim of discriminatory\r\n\ntreatment.   Id. at 44.  Nor is it  surprising to us that the\r                            \r\n\ngovernment would  prosecute criminally a  charge of  multiple\r\n\nfalse loan applications totalling a considerable sum.\r\n\n     The government-misconduct claim that Lopez does argue at\r\n\nlength on appeal concerns Luis Plaza Lopez.  According to the\r\n\nallegations,  Plaza, while  serving  as  an Assistant  United\r\n\nStates Attorney, began the  grand jury investigation of Lopez\r\n\nin February  1992, and  took a small  number of steps  in the\r\n\ninquiry  before  leaving  the  government  in  November 1992.\r\n\nPlaza  then  began representing  Lopez  in  dealing with  the\r\n\ngovernment's investigation.   Lopez  asserts that he  did not\r\n\nknow  of  Plaza's  prior role  in  his  case.   Plaza  ceased\r\n\nrepresenting Lopez  a year later, before  Lopez was indicted,\r\n\nafter  a new  United States  Attorney raised  questions about\r\n\nPlaza's dual role.\r\n\n     If  after leaving  the  government Plaza  worked on  the\r\n\nother side of the same matter, this would normally constitute\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                         -24-\r\r\n\na violation  of federal  law.   See  18 U.S.C.     207.   But\r                                               \r\n\nordinarily the  injured party  would be the  original client,\r\n\nhere the  government, which  would be  entitled to  fear that\r\n\nconfidential information might now be used against it by  its\r\n\nown former lawyer.   The  district court made  this point  in\r\n\ndeclining to  convene an evidentiary hearing  on this matter.\r\n\nLopez, 854 F. Supp. at 49.\r                 \r\n\n     Lopez responds by saying  that he was himself prejudiced\r\n\nbecause Plaza must have  carried into his new employment  his\r\n\nprosecutor's judgment that Lopez was guilty.   Lopez cites us\r\n\nto  case  law holding  that, for  just  this reason,  a judge\r\n\ncannot sit  on a matter  on which he worked  as a prosecutor.\r\n\nUnited States  v. Arnpriester,  37  F.3d 466,  467 (9th  Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1994).  The  analogy is not very persuasive.   The judge, who\r\n\nis  supposed to  be  impartial, is  disqualified because  his\r\n\nprior  connection   with   one  side   renders  his   present\r\n\nimpartiality suspect.  An attorney  is expected to be  loyal,\r\n\nnot impartial, and after switching sides has ample inducement\r\n\nto act in the interest of the attorney's new client.\r                                                        \r\n\n     But--Lopez  counters--in this case  Plaza, while serving\r                                              \r\n\nas   Lopez'  attorney,   told  Lopez   that  the   government\r\n\nprosecutors might drop charges if Lopez supported one of them\r\n\nfor the then open post of U.S. Attorney.   The implication is\r\n\nthat  Plaza was  working  as an  agent for  prosecutors, thus\r\n\ndepriving  Lopez of  his constitutional right  to independent\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                         -25-\r\r\n\ncounsel.  Assuming that Plaza ever conveyed such a message to\r\n\nLopez, Plaza's role was that of a go-between and was apparent\r\n\nto Lopez.   The suggestion  that Plaza therefore  had divided\r\n\nloyalties or was a government agent is rhetoric. \r\n\n     Lopez'  most  straightforward  complaint  is   that  the\r\n\nprosecutors,  when   they  discovered  that  Plaza   was  now\r\n\nappearing on  Lopez' side, should have  immediately disclosed\r\n\nto Lopez Plaza's prior involvement as prosecutor  in the same\r\n\ncase.   Lopez cites  us to cases where  the government has by\r\n\nits silence improperly reaped an advantage from disloyal acts\r\n\nof  private   defense  counsel   in   cooperation  with   the\r\n\ngovernment.  E.g., United  States v.  Marshank, 777  F. Supp.\r                                                          \r\n\n1507 (N.D. Cal. 1991).   But there is no indication  that the\r\n\ngovernment  gained any  advantage  from  delay in  disclosing\r\n\nPlaza's former affiliation, if undue delay there was.\r\n\n     The main job of the trial judge in a criminal case is to\r\n\ntry the defendant,  and there  is always a  tension when  the\r\n\ndefense seeks  to shift the focus to charges of improprieties\r\n\nor wrongdoing by the  government.  Where there  are plausible\r\n\nclaims of government misconduct prejudicing the rights of the\r\n\ndefendant, the district court cannot ignore them; but how far\r\n\nto   pursue  them,   and   in  what   manner,  depends   upon\r\n\ncircumstances, and  the judge  on the scene  has considerable\r\n\nlatitude.   United States v. Ortiz-Arrigiotia,  996 F.2d 436,\r                                                         \r\n\n442-43 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1368 (1994).\r                                                \r\n\n                             -26-\r                                         -26-\r\r\n\nHere,  the trial judge looked  about for big  fish, saw none,\r\n\nand let the red herrings go. \r\n\n                        V.  SENTENCING\r\n\n     Lopez was  sentenced pursuant  to the November  1, 1990,\r\n\nedition   of  the   Sentencing  Guidelines   (all  subsequent\r\n\nreferences are  to  that  edition).    The  seven  counts  of\r\n\nconviction   were  grouped,  U.S.S.G.     3D1.2,  and  Lopez'\r\n\nsentence was calculated under section 2F1.1, which prescribes\r\n\na base offense  level of  6 for offenses  involving fraud  or\r\n\ndeceit.\r\n\n     The  main variable under section  2F1.1 is the amount of\r\n\n\"loss\"   inflicted  or  intended,   and  the  district  court\r\n\ncalculated the total loss for the seven counts as $6,689,051,\r\n\nrequiring   an   increase  of   14   levels.     U.S.S.G.    \r\n\n2F1.1(b)(1)(O).    The  district court  added  six additional\r\n\nlevels, representing  two levels  each for more  than minimal\r\n\nplanning, id.    2F1.1(b)(2), abuse of  a position of  trust,\r                         \r\n\nid.     3B1.3,  and  obstruction of  justice  for  committing\r               \r\n\nperjury during trial, id.   3C1.1.\r                                     \r\n\n     The resulting total base offense level was 26 (6 plus 14\r\n\nplus  6).    Lopez had  no  prior  convictions  and, given  a\r\n\ncriminal  history category  of  I, his  offense  level of  26\r\n\ncorresponds  to  a  guideline  range  of  63  to  78  months'\r\n\nimprisonment.   The  court  chose to  construct the  63-month\r\n\nsentence  by imposing  concurrent sentences  of 24  months on\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                         -27-\r\r\n\ncount 1 (the conduct  underlying this count occurred  when an\r\n\nearlier version of  section 1014 was in effect  that provided\r\n\nfor  a two-year maximum sentence), 63 months each on counts 2\r\n\nthrough 5, and 60 months each on counts 6 and  7 (there being\r\n\na 60-month statutory maximum on those last two counts).\r\n\n     Lopez  has not challenged the base  offense level or the\r\n\nsix-level  adjustment   for  planning,  abuse  of   trust  or\r\n\nobstruction.   He  does  challenge the  loss calculations  on\r\n\ncounts  1 through  5,  and  on  certain  of  his  claims  the\r\n\ngovernment suggests a remand.  Having reversed convictions on\r\n\nthose false statement  counts, we have no reason  to consider\r\n\nthe claims  of error as  to sentences on  those counts.   Our\r\n\nconcern  is  limited  to   Lopez'  separate  attacks  on  the\r\n\ncalculations as to counts 6 and 7.\r\n\n     The broader of the  two challenges made by Lopez  to his\r\n\nsentence on counts 6 and 7  is that the government failed  to\r\n\nshow either an actual or an intended loss to the partnerships\r\n\nbecause  Lopez was  charged with having  improperly withdrawn\r\n\n$308,481 from the partnerships'  reserve accounts in 1988 and\r\n\nthe same year the partnerships allegedly owed Lopez $741,000.\r\n\nLopez' brief reasons that the \"withdrawal of monies that were\r\n\nowed to him . . . did not cause the partnerships any `actual'\r\n\neconomic loss,\"  nor can  there have  been any  intended loss\r\n\nbecause \"here, the alleged crime was complete yet there still\r\n\nwas no loss.\"  The argument is clever but unpersuasive.\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                         -28-\r\r\n\n     If a  defendant had picked  the pocket of a  victim in a\r\n\ncrowded elevator, gaining $10 in the process, it would not be\r\n\na  defense when  the $10  loss figure  was attributed  to the\r\n\ndefendant at sentencing  to say that  the victim happened  to\r\n\nowe the defendant an even larger sum.  As long as  a theft or\r\n\ndiversion is concealed or disguised, the victim has no reason\r\n\nto  think that its debt has been  reduced.  In this sense the\r\n\nloss caused by Lopez was both actual and intended.\r\n\n     Lopez' second  argument is  less ambiguous but  may have\r\n\nmore  substance.    It  is  common  ground  that  the  amount\r\n\nwithdrawn  by Lopez  from the partnerships'  reserve accounts\r\n\nwas  $308,481.  This was the amount charged in the indictment\r\n\nand,  interestingly,  it  is  the  figure  specified  by  the\r\n\ndistrict court  in its order requiring  restitution, an order\r\n\nthat  Lopez has  not  challenged.   Yet  in reliance  on  the\r\n\nprobation report, the district court found a loss of $436,176\r\n\nattributable  to the wire fraud  counts; and as  we shall see\r\n\nthe difference between the two figures may matter.\r\n\n     The probation  officer originally calculated the loss on\r\n\ncounts 6 and 7 as $308,481 but thereafter a letter containing\r\n\na  victim   impact  statement   was  received   from  Capital\r\n\nManagement  Strategies  claiming a  loss  of  $632,917.   The\r\n\nprobation  officer deducted various  amounts from this larger\r\n\nfigure concluding that they did not reflect losses imposed by\r\n\nLopez.   The amount  left was  $436,276, which the  probation\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                         -29-\r\r\n\nofficer  and   the  district   court  adopted  as   the  loss\r\n\nattributable  to counts 6 and 7.  The victim impact statement\r\n\nwas not  attached to the  pre-sentencing report so  the basis\r\n\nfor  the claimed  total  loss  of  $632,917 is  difficult  to\r\n\ndiscern.\r\n\n     At sentencing, the discrepancy  between the original and\r\n\nadjusted figures for the loss on counts 6 and 7  did not loom\r\n\nlarge, since  both  figures were  dwarfed  by the  losses  on\r\n\ncounts 1  through 5; whether the  loss of counts 6  and 7 was\r\n\n$308,481 or $436,176, the  total loss on all  counts appeared\r\n\nto be within the $5 to $10 million range for which a 14-level\r\n\nincrease was required.   Nevertheless, at sentencing  defense\r\n\ncounsel took a swipe at the victim impact statement,  calling\r\n\nit \"a letter  that has  been alluded to  in the  pre-sentence\r\n\nreport.    No live  body,  no documentation.  .  .  . and  to\r\n\nindicate that there are $436,376 in the losses as a result of\r\n\nthat, I believe, is -- is improper.\"\r\n\n     On appeal,  Lopez says that  the letter in  question was\r\n\nnot  disclosed to him, despite a request, and argues that the\r\n\ntrial  judge \"failed  to  exercise  independent judgment  but\r\n\nrelied  mechanically  on  a  non-disclosed  hearsay  document\r\n\nreferred to very generally  in the pre-sentence report .  . .\r\n\n.\"   The government  responds that  in this  circuit reliable\r\n\nhearsay can be used  at sentencing, including hearsay adopted\r\n\nby  a pre-sentence report.

Tardiff, 969\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -30-\r                                         -30-\r\r\n\nF.2d 1283,  1287 (1st Cir.  1992).  Lopez then  says that the\r\n\nvictim  impact statement  had  no indicia  of reliability,  a\r\n\npoint difficult to resolve since it is not before us.\r\n\n     It  is not  necessary  to  decide  these issues  in  the\r\n\nabstract  because the case must in all events be remanded for\r\n\nresentencing.  The bulk of the losses, and thus a significant\r\n\npart of Lopez'  sentence on counts 6 and  7, rests on amounts\r\n\nattributed  to  the  counts  that  we  have  reversed.    The\r\n\ngovernment  has not  given us  any reason  to think  that the\r\n\nlosses for counts 1 through 5 can be attributed to Lopez in a\r\n\nresentencing on counts 6 and 7.   The possibility that it may\r\n\nretry Lopez on counts 1 through 5 is irrelevant at present.\r\n\n     The base offense level for  counts 6 and 7 and  the six-\r\n\nlevel increase  have not  been challenged  on appeal,  so the\r\n\nonly  question is the amount of loss.  The difference between\r\n\nthe two alternative figures here is significant; the $308,481\r\n\nfigure  would seemingly produce  a total offense  level of 20\r\n\nand a  sentencing range  of 33-41  months,  while the  larger\r\n\n$436,276 figure would produce a total offense level of 21 and\r\n\na  range of  37-46 months.   Although  one might  construct a\r\n\ntechnical argument  to defend  the use  of the  larger figure\r\n\n(e.g.,  because  Lopez  did   not  counter  the  report  with\r                 \r\n\nevidence), we think that simple justice suggests that this is\r\n\nthe wrong course to  follow, especially since resentencing is\r\n\nrequired in any event.\r\n\n                             -31-\r                                         -31-\r\r\n\n     If  on remand the government wants to rely on the larger\r\n\nof the  two figures,  the victim impact  statement should  be\r\n\nmade  available  to  Lopez'  counsel  prior  to resentencing.\r\n\nWhether  the government  wants to  support the  larger figure\r\n\nwith any other kind  of evidence, and whether Lopez  wants to\r\n\nseek  an evidentiary hearing at which the maker of the victim\r\n\nimpact statement  can be cross-examined, are  matters for the\r\n\nfuture.  What we will not do is uphold on this record the use\r\n\nof the  larger figure where a procedural flaw arguably exists\r\n\nand we ourselves cannot discern the basis for the figure.\r\n\n     The  convictions and sentences on counts 1 through 5 are\r\n\nvacated;  the government  may  retry the  defendant on  those\r                   \r\n\ncounts or  not, as it chooses.   The convictions  on counts 6\r\n\nand  7 are affirmed but the sentences imposed on those counts\r                               \r\n\nare  vacated and the case remanded  for resentencing on those\r                                              \r\n\ncounts of conviction.\r\n\n     It is so ordered.\r                                  \r\n\n                             -32-\r                                         -32-\r\r\n",

In this appeal, able counsel on both sides have briefed a host of issues, several of which pose difficult and important questions.  We conclude by affirming on two counts and vacating on five others.  The case is remanded for resentencing on the two affirmed counts and for retrial on the five vacated counts, if sought by the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez was tried under a superseding indictment returned on February 18, 1994.  Counts 1 through 5 charged him with making false representations to federally insured banks, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1014, to influence loans to Lopez and his businesses, Four Winds Rental, Inc., and Multi-Media Television, Inc.  Counts 6 and 7 charged Lopez with wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343, based on Lopez' withdrawal of over $300,000 from the reserve accounts of certain limited partnerships managed by Lopez through Four Winds Rental, Inc.  The jury trial began on June 6, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's evidence on the first five counts aimed to show that Lopez made false statements or submitted false documents to obtain loans, or extensions of loans, on five occasions.  Three involved substantial sums borrowed from First Federal Savings Bank;  another, a loan extension from Chase Manhattan;  and the last, a loan from Banco Central.  In each instance the alleged misinformation concerned the value or existence of collateral to secure the loan, and the facts differed in each instance.  No description of the events is necessary to our disposition of these false statement counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two wire fraud charges, reflected in counts 6 and 7, related to a different matter, namely, Lopez' withdrawal of over $300,000 from reserve accounts of certain limited partnerships that owned multi-unit, federally subsidized housing projects in Puerto Rico.  Four Winds managed and had a very small ownership interest in each partnership, the balance being held by other limited partners represented by Capital Management Strategies, Inc., a Rockville, Maryland, real estate syndicator.  The properties were financed by the Farmers' Home Administration, which restricted the use of the funds in the accounts to specific purposes, primarily repairs and improvements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gist of the government's charge was that in 1988 Lopez had withdrawn the sums in question from these accounts without the required permission and had created false invoices on the letterhead of a construction company to account for the withdrawals.  The government offered evidence that Lopez had created the invoices in amounts matching the withdrawals, that no such construction work had ever been performed, and that the invoices were nevertheless supplied to auditors to explain the withdrawals.  The wire element related to two faxes, allegedly sent by Lopez to Capital Management Strategies in late 1990 and early 1991, responding to its inquiry as to the purpose of the withdrawals and the existence of the required approvals by Farmers' Home Administration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About two weeks into the trial, on the evening of June 22, 1994, Lopez was rushed to a hospital emergency room with serious symptoms.  Within a day, the trial judge took testimony from the emergency room internist and, shortly thereafter, heard from a court-appointed cardiologist.  Later tests revealed that Lopez was suffering a small brain lesion or tumor which was serious but, if properly treated, was not likely to be life threatening.  The doctors agreed that the tumor had to be removed but not on an emergency basis, and surgery was scheduled for August.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These events caused a recess of the trial from June 22 until July 6, at which time a hearing was held to consider motions by Lopez' counsel for a mistrial based on the lack of competency or for a continuance for purposes of treatment.  The thrust of Lopez' objections was that medications prescribed for him caused side effects that interfered with his ability to proceed.  Relying partly on the advice of the court-designated neurologist, Dr. Charles Payne, the court denied the motions, and Dr. Payne was ultimately placed in charge of prescribing medications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same objections were thereafter renewed several times but denied.  There were further examinations by Dr. Payne and testimony by him that Lopez was alert, could understand the charges and assist his lawyers, and was not being compromised by the prescribed medications.  From July 11 through July 13, Lopez testified in his own defense.  On July 18, the jury convicted Lopez on all seven counts.  Thereafter, the district court rejected a post-trial motion directed to competency.  It had earlier refused to order an investigation into alleged prosecutorial misconduct in the initiating of the prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the trial, Lopez remained on bail and underwent surgery for the removal of the tumor.  On November 17, 1994, Lopez was sentenced to a prison term of 63 months, based primarily on loss calculations that are challenged by Lopez on appeal.  Motions for continuation of bail pending appeal were denied by the district court and by this court.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3143(b)(1)(B).  Lopez is currently serving his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. MEDICAL ISSUES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Lopez' first and most dramatic claim is that he was forced to continue his trial while afflicted with a life-threatening brain tumor and while requiring a whole battery of medications to cope with various symptoms.  These medications, Lopez suggests, interfered with his ability to remember, concentrate and present himself credibly, and undermined his trial testimony.  He further asserts that the trial judge effectively compelled him to accept such medications and, without basis, charged him with malingering or attempting to over-medicate in order to frustrate the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although these are the core factual allegations, the legal claim presented has an unusual twist.  Lopez does not claim that he was \"incompetent\" to stand trial under the ordinary rubric, see Godinez v. Moran, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 2685, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993), or that his health would be so damaged by the trial that it would be inhumane to continue.  Instead, relying primarily on Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 112 S.Ct. 1810, 118 L.Ed.2d 479 (1992), Lopez says that the trial court \"instead of choosing a less intrusive alternative--a halt in the proceedings so that Lopez could have surgery--violated Lopez' constitutional rights by imposing a 'regime' of medication that so impaired Lopez' abilities that he was unable to testify coherently on his own behalf.\"Riggins, which the government says was not relied upon in the district court, contains language colorably pertinent to this case, but involved a fundamentally different issue.  Riggins was tried for murder and, as eight Justices viewed the facts, the trial court required Riggins to continue taking a powerful antipsychotic drug generically known as thioridazine.  Riggins' claim to the Supreme Court, after his conviction and death sentence, was that he had been compelled unconstitutionally to take this medication and that the drug concealed his true mental state from the jury and impaired his ability to present his insanity defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court held that Riggins had a substantial interest under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in \"avoiding involuntary administration of antipsychotic drugs....\"  Id. at 134, 112 S.Ct. at 1814.   Although the Court said that forced medication could sometimes be justified (e.g., to protect the defendant's health or protect others from danger), the trial judge in Riggins had made no such findings.  For this reason, and given the \"strong possibility\" or \"substantial probability\" that Riggins' defense had been impaired, id. at 137-38, 112 S.Ct. at 1816-17, the Court declined to require a showing of actual prejudice and overturned the conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The concern in Riggins with forced medication is not present in this case.  Although Lopez points to the trial court's threat to revoke bail and imprison him so that a doctor could supervise his medication, the incident had nothing to do with forcing on Lopez any medication that he did not want.  The trial court thought that some of the symptoms of which Lopez was complaining (e.g., grogginess) had been induced by over-medication;  at the outset a number of doctors were prescribing different drugs, and testimony showed that over-medication might be the cause of such problems.  The record shows that Lopez himself wanted proper medication and was content to have Dr. Payne prescribe and supervise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean that Lopez is without a potential claim.  That claim, made below and adequately presented here in the course of the Riggins argument, is that the medications, necessary even if voluntarily taken, impaired Lopez' ability to present his defense.  Even assuming Lopez' \"competency,\" that being a fairly easy test to satisfy, Godinez, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2685, the threat of impairment permitted a request for a continuance.  Here, Lopez argues, the district court had a reasonable alternative that should have been adopted, namely, to postpone the trial until the operation had occurred and removed or diminished the need for drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant, especially one proposing to testify at trial about complex financial transactions, is entitled to be concerned about his fitness.  For good medical reasons, Lopez was taking a number of medications, some capable of producing side effects that could impair clarity of mind.  The drugs were designed to prevent seizures, control blood pressure, relieve pain, induce sleep, reduce agitation and prevent depression;  and they included Darvocet, ProSom, Dilantin, Vasotec, Valium, Esgic Plus and Sinequan.  At various times Lopez reported that he had severe headaches, was unable to sleep, and was suffering from memory lapses.  His lawyers protested that Lopez had problems communicating with them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez' health obviously warranted an inquiry by the trial judge.  Far from ignoring the issue, the trial court deferred trial for a substantial period, summoned medical experts one after another, took an active role in securing diagnoses for Lopez, had him re-examined repeatedly, and took testimony and made findings in abundance, including a detailed post-trial order summarizing the court's findings and reasons for proceeding with trial.  There is no need to describe the procedural steps in detail because Lopez himself does not seriously suggest that the investigation was flawed or inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The substantive issue is more difficult.  The testimony of the various doctors confirms that a number of the drugs Lopez took have the potential to cause side effects such as grogginess that could interfere with defendant's ability to present his case.  Yet the main thrust of the doctors' testimony, fairly read, was that the doctors thought that proper prescription and careful monitoring would meet these threats.  Such a monitoring regime was in place when Lopez testified.  The doctors who gave testimony raising the most doubts did so at the outset (while several doctors were prescribing drugs for Lopez, apparently without much coordination).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez' main trial counsel did protest at times that his client was not able to cooperate fully;  but these complaints of Lopez' conduct during trial are balanced, if not outweighed, by the district court's findings that Lopez appeared to be well oriented and was cooperating with counsel.  In all events, a reputable expert unaffiliated with the prosecution or defense--Dr. Payne--gave firm testimony that Lopez was fit to testify.  His testimony was based on examinations of Lopez close in time and on the monitoring of his medicine.  Even on a cold record, Dr. Payne's testimony carries conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Lopez' own testimony, which he claims suffered because of his medical condition, the evidence is inconclusive.  It is not the most organized and responsive testimony we have ever read;  but Lopez was confined by evidentiary rulings that limited him in presenting information that he and his counsel thought helpful but the trial judge thought irrelevant (e.g., such as whether the banks had sustained actual losses).  Much of the disarray in his testimony appears to be caused by such struggles between Lopez and the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no doubt that Lopez in addition was under great stress.  This is true for many criminal defendants, but surely it was augmented here by the tumor.  In a few instances Lopez' initial medication caused some adverse side effects while it was being adjusted.  On the other hand, the trial had already progressed for several weeks before Lopez' emergency room visit, and much of the medication was directed to medical symptoms--difficulty in sleeping, high blood pressure, anxiety--that could easily have continued even if the trial had been delayed and the tumor removed.  The medical advice itself largely supported the course followed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a classic instance in which the district court had to exercise its informed judgment.  In such cases, so long as sound procedures are followed, the court's ultimate judgment is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.  United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 13 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990).  Whether to proceed with the trial or await the operation may well have been a hard question.  But on appeal, we think it easy to conclude that the trial judge acted within his discretion in deciding, with expert medical support and after careful investigation, to proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the suggestion that the district court was hostile to the defendant.  Most judges are suspicious of a mid-trial request for a continuance or mistrial, and the record confirms that Lopez' initial symptoms may have been caused in part by over-medication, even if inadvertent or the product of too many doctors.  Paragons may exist among trial judges who can maintain perfect discipline with perfect tact;  but for most, a certain sternness in manner and an abiding skepticism about delay are a necessary part of the arsenal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counts 1-5.   The first five counts of the indictment charged Lopez under a statute that punishes anyone who \"knowingly makes any false statement\" to influence federally insured financial institutions.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 1014.  The indictment charged, and the district court assumed, that materiality was an element of the offense.  But, as was commonly done in most circuits at the time, the trial judge resolved the materiality issue himself and did not submit it to the jury.  The defense objected to this procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following Lopez' conviction, the Supreme Court decided United States v. Gaudin, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995).  There, the Court held that where materiality is an element of an offense, it must under the Sixth Amendment be submitted to the jury.  The government's main response to Gaudin is that materiality is not an element under section 1014.  Alternatively, the government says that any error was harmless because the evidence overwhelmingly proved materiality and no rational jury could have found otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has already held that section 1014 requires \"that the false statement concern[ ] a material fact.\"  United States v. Concemi, 957 F.2d 942, 951 (1st Cir.1992).  This view is consistent with that of several other circuits.  E.g. United States v. Wells, 63 F.3d 745, 750 (8th Cir.1995);  United States v. Staniforth, 971 F.2d 1355, 1358 (7th Cir.1992).  Although the statute does not contain an explicit materiality requirement and the Second Circuit has held that no such requirement is to be inferred, United States v. Cleary, 565 F.2d 43, 46 (2d Cir.1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 915, 98 S.Ct. 1469, 55 L.Ed.2d 506 (1978), we are not disposed to regard the issue as an open one in this circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's alternative position is that any error that occurred in failing to submit the issue to the jury was harmless.  Most errors, including constitutional ones, are subject to harmless error analysis, Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 2081, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993), simply because it makes no sense to retry a case if the result will assuredly be the same.  But for various reasons, some errors are deemed fatal without proof of prejudice.  No one, for example, would think it was harmless error--no matter how conclusive the evidence of guilt--if the defendant were tried by a jury of five year olds or in a courtroom dominated by a lynch-mob.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has gone somewhat beyond such extreme cases, holding (for example) that a defective reasonable doubt instruction objected to at trial cannot be harmless error.  Id. at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2082-83.   The precedents make clear that it could not be harmless error for the trial judge to direct a verdict on the case as a whole, United States v. Martin Linen Supply, Co., 430 U.S. 564, 572-73, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 1355-56, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977);  and we think that the Court would apply the same analysis to a directed verdict on a single element of the offense.  Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S. 570, 581 n. 8, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 3107 n. 8, 92 L.Ed.2d 460 (1986);  Hoover v. Garfield Heights Municipal Court, 802 F.2d 168, 177-78 (6th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 949, 107 S.Ct. 1610, 94 L.Ed.2d 796 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We stress that it is of crucial importance to us that Lopez made a timely objection at trial to the judge's refusal to submit this issue to the jury.  This court has already indicated that where there is no timely objection, the \"plain error\" doctrine (see United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, ----, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777-78, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)), governs in deciding whether failure to submit an element to the jury calls for reversal.  United States v. Romero, 32 F.3d 641, 652 (1st Cir.1994).  See also Gaudin, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2322 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring).  The mix of considerations is very different where the trial judge has not been alerted by an objection.  Indeed, the element may be one that the defendant has chosen not to contest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even where a timely objection has been made, as in our own case, one might ask why the failure to submit an element to the jury should automatically be fatal, given that the harmless error doctrine can be invoked (not always successfully) in kindred cases, say, to remedy a misinstruction as to an element, Pope v. Illinois, 481 U.S. 497, 502, 107 S.Ct. 1918, 1922, 95 L.Ed.2d 439 (1987), or a faulty presumption, Rose, 478 U.S. at 579-80, 106 S.Ct. at 3106-07.   But labels like \"fundamental,\" id. at 577, 106 S.Ct. at 3105, and \"structural,\" Sullivan, 508 U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2083, tend to be surrogates for matters of degree and for multiple concerns.  In all events, our best guess is that the Supreme Court would regard an omitted element reversible error per se if there were a timely objection--although not automatically \"plain error\" if no objection occurred--and this conclusion almost disposes of the government's fallback position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We say \"almost\" because the government could argue that the jury, although instructed not to, actually did decide the materiality issue when it found that Lopez did intend to influence the bank loans by false statements.  In theory, the question of purpose (the defendant's specific intent) differs from the question of materiality (whether an objective lender would be likely to be influenced by the statement).  Purpose could exist without materiality, and vice versa.  But in most cases no independent proof exists of a defendant's specific intent;  rather, the jury infers such purpose from the fact that the statement would so influence an ordinary lender.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government hints at this argument in its brief but makes no effort to show that in this case the jury must have so reasoned, a conclusion that might require a showing both that the evidence of materiality was overwhelming and that other evidence of purpose was thin or absent.  If an adequate showing were made, we would have to decide whether it would satisfy the Supreme Court.  There is some reason to think that it might, see Sullivan, 508 U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2082, but it will be time enough to consider this question in a case where the factual predicate is adequately developed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counts 6 and 7.   Lopez' attacks on the wire fraud convictions remain to be considered.  In his opening brief, Lopez challenged the wire fraud convictions on three grounds:  that the evidence did not show a scheme to defraud;  that the use of the wires was not in furtherance of such a scheme;  that in any event there was no proof that Lopez was responsible for any such use of the wires.  We address the points in the same order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Lopez says that the evidence does not show that there was a scheme to defraud.  He argues that the government did not show that the withdrawals from the reserve accounts were diverted to his personal use or that they were directly linked to the false invoices;  and he says that the partnerships owed him money in excess of anything withdrawn and that as a general partner he had authority to withdraw funds.  These arguments peel apart into distinct factual and legal issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with the facts, the government apparently did not prove at trial where the withdrawn money went.  But it did show that Lopez' withdrawals matched false construction-company invoices in the same amounts and that Lopez had prepared the invoices, together with false checks on the accounts purporting to pay the invoices.  Absent other evidence, the jury was entitled to infer that Lopez had employed the false documents to disguise the withdrawals and divert them to his own use.  This is enough for a scheme to defraud without proof as to where he concealed the proceeds or how he spent the money.  Cf. United States v. Yefsky, 994 F.2d 885, 892 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the legal defenses, Lopez as manager apparently could withdraw funds for proper purposes, but the jury reasonably concluded that the purpose here was illicit.  Nor is it pertinent that the partnerships may have owed Lopez money.  The accounts in question here were restricted to repairs and other narrow uses;  and, more important, the records Lopez created gave the impression that the money had been used for repairs.  The scheme, if successful, would have enriched Lopez without reducing the ventures' apparent obligations to Lopez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Lopez says that the evidence did not show that the wires--the basis for federal jurisdiction--were used in furtherance of the scheme.  The money, he notes, was withdrawn in 1988;  and the faxes, responding to inquiries about the withdrawals, occurred in late 1990 and early 1991.  Lopez concludes that if any fraud occurred, it was completed long before the faxes were ever sent.  No other use of wires was alleged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law requires that the use of the wires must be \"incident to an essential part of the scheme,\" Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 8, 74 S.Ct. 358, 362, 98 L.Ed. 435 (1954), but the cases have stretched that concept to include use of the wires in attempts \" 'to lull the victims into a sense of false security, postpone their ultimate complaint to the authorities, and therefore make the apprehension of the defendants less likely.' \"  United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438, 451-52, 106 S.Ct. 725, 733-34, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986) (quoting an earlier decision).  It is hard to see why the jury could not find that the faxes in this case do not fit that description.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez says that the faxes do not explicitly refer to the withdrawals and that they refer to events after 1988 and so could not justify the withdrawals.  But the faxes were sent in response to inquiries that did refer to the withdrawals and it is not a complete answer to say that the faxes were not directly responsive to the inquiries.  Rather, the responses could be read as attempts to talk around the issue, to confuse matters, and ultimately to delay or avoid detection.  This permissible inference satisfies the Lane criterion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Lopez says that the government failed to prove that he sent the December 1990 fax (count 6) or that the January 1991 document (count 7) was transmitted by wire.  The former was sent from the accounting firm used by Four Winds Rental and an accountant testified that he faxed the letter as a \"courtesy for ... Mr. Lopez\" because \"either he or someone from his office was in--in our office that day.\"   The letter is not signed but the accompanying cover sheet, prepared by the accounting firm, says that the letter is from Lopez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quite apart from the cover sheet, the content of the letter reveals that it is a response to the earlier letter of inquiry to Lopez.  The wording of the letter is substantially the same as the subsequent letter of January 14, 1991, which was signed by Lopez.  It was a fair inference that Lopez had also composed the earlier letter and either directed the accountant to fax it or sent someone in his employ to do so.  All that is required is that Lopez caused the letter to be faxed and the jury could find that he did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the January 1991 letter, Lopez does not deny authorship but questions the proof that it had been faxed.  The letter was found in the files of Capital Management Strategies together with a page bearing the phrases \"Telefax Communication\" and \"Fax Cover Sheet\" as well as the Four Winds logo;  and the page describes Lopez as the sender and bears the same date as the letter.  This is adequate circumstantial evidence that the document was faxed and serves to distinguish United States v. Srulowitz, 785 F.2d 382 (2d Cir.1986), where no circumstantial evidence showed that a letter found in a file had been mailed to a third party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez contends in his reply brief that the Gaudin decision also requires reversal of his convictions for wire fraud.  The government charged that Lopez had used interstate wires in furtherance of a scheme to obtain money by means of false representations, thereby violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343.  Lopez says that such false representations must be material and that it was error not to so instruct the jury and require it to find materiality.  The government says that this issue was not preserved, but Gaudin is a recent and not entirely predictable decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the merits, Lopez' argument confronts an initial difficulty.  In United States v. Faulhaber, 929 F.2d 16, 18 (1st Cir.1991), this court found no materiality requirement in the substantially identical federal mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341, stating that the jury was not required to find that the scheme would have defrauded a person of \"ordinary prudence and comprehension.\"  Faulhaber 's position is at odds with some circuits and with both of the standard instruction treatises.  E.g., United States v. Dunn, 961 F.2d 648, 651 (7th Cir.1992);  1A L.Sand, J. Siffert, W. Loughlin &amp; S. Reiss, Modern Federal Jury Instructions Sec. 44.01 (1995).  But whether Faulhaber warrants re-examination is a subject for another occasion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our case, the district court did instruct the jury that a \"scheme to defraud\" required that the \"plan [be one] reasonably calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence and comprehension by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\"   This language embodies the materiality standard.  The only deceptive conduct charged under counts 6 and 7 involved false or fraudulent documents, so it hardly matters that the \"reasonably calculated\" and \"ordinary prudence\" language referred to the word \"plan\" rather than the false statements.  In short, assuming that materiality is an element in wire fraud, the issue was effectively submitted to the jury in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. GOVERNMENT MISCONDUCT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial, Lopez filed a motion alleging government misconduct and seeking to have the indictment dismissed, or at least to obtain additional discovery and an evidentiary hearing.  He claimed that he was a victim of vindictive and selective prosecution and that the indictment had been tainted by a conflict of interest on the part of a former Assistant United States Attorney who had played a minor role in the investigation of Lopez and later served for a period as Lopez' defense counsel prior to indictment.  The district court denied this motion.  United States v. Lopez, 854 F.Supp. 41 (D.P.R.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the claim of improper prosecution.  Lopez told the district court that he had been prosecuted because he refused to use his political influence in favor of the reappointment of a former U.S. Attorney for Puerto Rico.  Further, he claimed that defendants in his position are normally pursued civilly on false statement claims, so the prosecution was selective as well as vindictive.  His evidence on the first point was thin;  on the second, the government offered the district court evidence that Lopez' case did fall within its guidelines for criminal prosecutions because of the amounts involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Lopez has condensed his argument on the claim of improper prosecution to a couple of sentences and a pair of footnotes.  The arguments are used primarily to add color to his other claim of government misconduct, relating to the dual role of the lawyer who allegedly represented first the government and then Lopez in the same matter.  Arguments not seriously developed on appeal are waived, Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17, and in this instance we also think that a deliberate, and reasonable, strategy choice was made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, those charges of selective and vindictive prosecution indirectly concern the integrity of the judicial process.  We have therefore reviewed with care the pertinent filings in the district court, the district court's lengthy discussion of the subject, what little Lopez has to say about the matter on appeal, and the government's more extensive rebuttal.  Although the waiver relieves us of the need to set out the facts in detail, we comment briefly on each branch of Lopez' claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not ignore the serious charges of blackmail made against certain members of the U.S. Attorney's office, but analyzed the proffered evidence with care.  This evidence consisted primarily of hearsay and conjecture, and the district court after scrutiny found it insufficient to require an evidentiary hearing.  Lopez, 854 F.Supp. at 45-46.   The district court's judgment call was not unreasonable on its face, especially where as here the vindictive prosecution claim falls outside the narrow area where such a claim traditionally has been recognized, e.g., United States v. Garza-Juarez, 992 F.2d 896, 905 (9th Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 724, 126 L.Ed.2d 688 (1994), and where the prosecution itself was conducted by a new U.S. Attorney not implicated by Lopez' allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for selective prosecution, the district court asked the government for information about its prosecution policy.  The government supplied the data and the court ruled that Lopez had not made out a colorable claim of discriminatory treatment.  Id. at 44.   Nor is it surprising to us that the government would prosecute criminally a charge of multiple false loan applications totalling a considerable sum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government-misconduct claim that Lopez does argue at length on appeal concerns Luis Plaza Lopez.  According to the allegations, Plaza, while serving as an Assistant United States Attorney, began the grand jury investigation of Lopez in February 1992, and took a small number of steps in the inquiry before leaving the government in November 1992.  Plaza then began representing Lopez in dealing with the government's investigation.  Lopez asserts that he did not know of Plaza's prior role in his case.  Plaza ceased representing Lopez a year later, before Lopez was indicted, after a new United States Attorney raised questions about Plaza's dual role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If after leaving the government Plaza worked on the other side of the same matter, this would normally constitute a violation of federal law.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 207.  But ordinarily the injured party would be the original client, here the government, which would be entitled to fear that confidential information might now be used against it by its own former lawyer.  The district court made this point in declining to convene an evidentiary hearing on this matter.  Lopez, 854 F.Supp. at 49.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez responds by saying that he was himself prejudiced because Plaza must have carried into his new employment his prosecutor's judgment that Lopez was guilty.  Lopez cites us to case law holding that, for just this reason, a judge cannot sit on a matter on which he worked as a prosecutor.  United States v. Arnpriester, 37 F.3d 466, 467 (9th Cir.1994).  The analogy is not very persuasive.  The judge, who is supposed to be impartial, is disqualified because his prior connection with one side renders his present impartiality suspect.  An attorney is expected to be loyal, not impartial, and after switching sides has ample inducement to act in the interest of the attorney's new client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But--Lopez counters--in this case Plaza, while serving as Lopez' attorney, told Lopez that the government prosecutors might drop charges if Lopez supported one of them for the then open post of U.S. Attorney.  The implication is that Plaza was working as an agent for prosecutors, thus depriving Lopez of his constitutional right to independent counsel.  Assuming that Plaza ever conveyed such a message to Lopez, Plaza's role was that of a go-between and was apparent to Lopez.  The suggestion that Plaza therefore had divided loyalties or was a government agent is rhetoric.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez' most straightforward complaint is that the prosecutors, when they discovered that Plaza was now appearing on Lopez' side, should have immediately disclosed to Lopez Plaza's prior involvement as prosecutor in the same case.  Lopez cites us to cases where the government has by its silence improperly reaped an advantage from disloyal acts of private defense counsel in cooperation with the government.  E.g., United States v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (N.D.Cal.1991).  But there is no indication that the government gained any advantage from delay in disclosing Plaza's former affiliation, if undue delay there was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main job of the trial judge in a criminal case is to try the defendant, and there is always a tension when the defense seeks to shift the focus to charges of improprieties or wrongdoing by the government.  Where there are plausible claims of government misconduct prejudicing the rights of the defendant, the district court cannot ignore them;  but how far to pursue them, and in what manner, depends upon circumstances, and the judge on the scene has considerable latitude.  United States v. Ortiz-Arrigoitia, 996 F.2d 436, 442-43 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1368, 128 L.Ed.2d 45 (1994).  Here, the trial judge looked about for big fish, saw none, and let the red herrings go.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. SENTENCING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez was sentenced pursuant to the November 1, 1990, edition of the Sentencing Guidelines (all subsequent references are to that edition).  The seven counts of conviction were grouped, U.S.S.G. Sec. 3D1.2, and Lopez' sentence was calculated under section 2F1.1, which prescribes a base offense level of 6 for offenses involving fraud or deceit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main variable under section 2F1.1 is the amount of \"loss\" inflicted or intended, and the district court calculated the total loss for the seven counts as $6,689,051, requiring an increase of 14 levels.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1)(O).  The district court added six additional levels, representing two levels each for more than minimal planning, id. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(2), abuse of a position of trust, id. Sec. 3B1.3, and obstruction of justice for committing perjury during trial, id. Sec. 3C1.1</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The resulting total base offense level was 26 (6 plus 14 plus 6).  Lopez had no prior convictions and, given a criminal history category of I, his offense level of 26 corresponds to a guideline range of 63 to 78 months' imprisonment.  The court chose to construct the 63-month sentence by imposing concurrent sentences of 24 months on count 1 (the conduct underlying this count occurred when an earlier version of section 1014 was in effect that provided for a two-year maximum sentence), 63 months each on counts 2 through 5, and 60 months each on counts 6 and 7 (there being a 60-month statutory maximum on those last two counts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez has not challenged the base offense level or the six-level adjustment for planning, abuse of trust or obstruction.  He does challenge the loss calculations on counts 1 through 5, and on certain of his claims the government suggests a remand.  Having reversed convictions on those false statement counts, we have no reason to consider the claims of error as to sentences on those counts.  Our concern is limited to Lopez' separate attacks on the calculations as to counts 6 and 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The broader of the two challenges made by Lopez to his sentence on counts 6 and 7 is that the government failed to show either an actual or an intended loss to the partnerships because Lopez was charged with having improperly withdrawn $308,481 from the partnerships' reserve accounts in 1988 and the same year the partnerships allegedly owed Lopez $741,000.  Lopez' brief reasons that the \"withdrawal of monies that were owed to him ... did not cause the partnerships any 'actual' economic loss,\" nor can there have been any intended loss because \"here, the alleged crime was complete yet there still was no loss.\"   The argument is clever but unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a defendant had picked the pocket of a victim in a crowded elevator, gaining $10 in the process, it would not be a defense when the $10 loss figure was attributed to the defendant at sentencing to say that the victim happened to owe the defendant an even larger sum.  As long as a theft or diversion is concealed or disguised, the victim has no reason to think that its debt has been reduced.  In this sense the loss caused by Lopez was both actual and intended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez' second argument is less ambiguous but may have more substance.  It is common ground that the amount withdrawn by Lopez from the partnerships' reserve accounts was $308,481.  This was the amount charged in the indictment and, interestingly, it is the figure specified by the district court in its order requiring restitution, an order that Lopez has not challenged.  Yet in reliance on the probation report, the district court found a loss of $436,176 attributable to the wire fraud counts;  and as we shall see the difference between the two figures may matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probation officer originally calculated the loss on counts 6 and 7 as $308,481 but thereafter a letter containing a victim impact statement was received from Capital Management Strategies claiming a loss of $632,917.  The probation officer deducted various amounts from this larger figure concluding that they did not reflect losses imposed by Lopez.  The amount left was $436,276, which the probation officer and the district court adopted as the loss attributable to counts 6 and 7.  The victim impact statement was not attached to the pre-sentencing report so the basis for the claimed total loss of $632,917 is difficult to discern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the discrepancy between the original and adjusted figures for the loss on counts 6 and 7 did not loom large, since both figures were dwarfed by the losses on counts 1 through 5;  whether the loss of counts 6 and 7 was $308,481 or $436,176, the total loss on all counts appeared to be within the $5 to $10 million range for which a 14-level increase was required.  Nevertheless, at sentencing defense counsel took a swipe at the victim impact statement, calling it \"a letter that has been alluded to in the pre-sentence report.  No live body, no documentation.... and to indicate that there are $436,376 in the losses as a result of that, I believe, is--is improper.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Lopez says that the letter in question was not disclosed to him, despite a request, and argues that the trial judge \"failed to exercise independent judgment but relied mechanically on a non-disclosed hearsay document referred to very generally in the pre-sentence report....\"  The government responds that in this circuit reliable hearsay can be used at sentencing, including hearsay adopted by a pre-sentence report.  See United States v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283, 1287 (1st Cir.1992).  Lopez then says that the victim impact statement had no indicia of reliability, a point difficult to resolve since it is not before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not necessary to decide these issues in the abstract because the case must in all events be remanded for resentencing.  The bulk of the losses, and thus a significant part of Lopez' sentence on counts 6 and 7, rests on amounts attributed to the counts that we have reversed.  The government has not given us any reason to think that the losses for counts 1 through 5 can be attributed to Lopez in a resentencing on counts 6 and 7.  The possibility that it may retry Lopez on counts 1 through 5 is irrelevant at present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The base offense level for counts 6 and 7 and the six-level increase have not been challenged on appeal, so the only question is the amount of loss.  The difference between the two alternative figures here is significant;  the $308,481 figure would seemingly produce a total offense level of 20 and a sentencing range of 33-41 months, while the larger $436,276 figure would produce a total offense level of 21 and a range of 37-46 months.  Although one might construct a technical argument to defend the use of the larger figure (e.g., because Lopez did not counter the report with evidence), we think that simple justice suggests that this is the wrong course to follow, especially since resentencing is required in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If on remand the government wants to rely on the larger of the two figures, the victim impact statement should be made available to Lopez' counsel prior to resentencing.  Whether the government wants to support the larger figure with any other kind of evidence, and whether Lopez wants to seek an evidentiary hearing at which the maker of the victim impact statement can be cross-examined, are matters for the future.  What we will not do is uphold on this record the use of the larger figure where a procedural flaw arguably exists and we ourselves cannot discern the basis for the figure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The convictions and sentences on counts 1 through 5 are vacated;  the government may retry the defendant on those counts or not, as it chooses.

In this appeal, able counsel on both sides have briefed a host of issues, several of which pose difficult and important questions.  We conclude by affirming on two counts and vacating on five others.  The case is remanded for resentencing on the two affirmed counts and for retrial on the five vacated counts, if sought by the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez was tried under a superseding indictment returned on February 18, 1994.  Counts 1 through 5 charged him with making false representations to federally insured banks, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1014, to influence loans to Lopez and his businesses, Four Winds Rental, Inc., and Multi-Media Television, Inc.  Counts 6 and 7 charged Lopez with wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343, based on Lopez' withdrawal of over $300,000 from the reserve accounts of certain limited partnerships managed by Lopez through Four Winds Rental, Inc.  The jury trial began on June 6, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's evidence on the first five counts aimed to show that Lopez made false statements or submitted false documents to obtain loans, or extensions of loans, on five occasions.  Three involved substantial sums borrowed from First Federal Savings Bank;  another, a loan extension from Chase Manhattan;  and the last, a loan from Banco Central.  In each instance the alleged misinformation concerned the value or existence of collateral to secure the loan, and the facts differed in each instance.  No description of the events is necessary to our disposition of these false statement counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two wire fraud charges, reflected in counts 6 and 7, related to a different matter, namely, Lopez' withdrawal of over $300,000 from reserve accounts of certain limited partnerships that owned multi-unit, federally subsidized housing projects in Puerto Rico.  Four Winds managed and had a very small ownership interest in each partnership, the balance being held by other limited partners represented by Capital Management Strategies, Inc., a Rockville, Maryland, real estate syndicator.  The properties were financed by the Farmers' Home Administration, which restricted the use of the funds in the accounts to specific purposes, primarily repairs and improvements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gist of the government's charge was that in 1988 Lopez had withdrawn the sums in question from these accounts without the required permission and had created false invoices on the letterhead of a construction company to account for the withdrawals.  The government offered evidence that Lopez had created the invoices in amounts matching the withdrawals, that no such construction work had ever been performed, and that the invoices were nevertheless supplied to auditors to explain the withdrawals.  The wire element related to two faxes, allegedly sent by Lopez to Capital Management Strategies in late 1990 and early 1991, responding to its inquiry as to the purpose of the withdrawals and the existence of the required approvals by Farmers' Home Administration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About two weeks into the trial, on the evening of June 22, 1994, Lopez was rushed to a hospital emergency room with serious symptoms.  Within a day, the trial judge took testimony from the emergency room internist and, shortly thereafter, heard from a court-appointed cardiologist.  Later tests revealed that Lopez was suffering a small brain lesion or tumor which was serious but, if properly treated, was not likely to be life threatening.  The doctors agreed that the tumor had to be removed but not on an emergency basis, and surgery was scheduled for August.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These events caused a recess of the trial from June 22 until July 6, at which time a hearing was held to consider motions by Lopez' counsel for a mistrial based on the lack of competency or for a continuance for purposes of treatment.  The thrust of Lopez' objections was that medications prescribed for him caused side effects that interfered with his ability to proceed.  Relying partly on the advice of the court-designated neurologist, Dr. Charles Payne, the court denied the motions, and Dr. Payne was ultimately placed in charge of prescribing medications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same objections were thereafter renewed several times but denied.  There were further examinations by Dr. Payne and testimony by him that Lopez was alert, could understand the charges and assist his lawyers, and was not being compromised by the prescribed medications.  From July 11 through July 13, Lopez testified in his own defense.  On July 18, the jury convicted Lopez on all seven counts.  Thereafter, the district court rejected a post-trial motion directed to competency.  It had earlier refused to order an investigation into alleged prosecutorial misconduct in the initiating of the prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the trial, Lopez remained on bail and underwent surgery for the removal of the tumor.  On November 17, 1994, Lopez was sentenced to a prison term of 63 months, based primarily on loss calculations that are challenged by Lopez on appeal.  Motions for continuation of bail pending appeal were denied by the district court and by this court.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3143(b)(1)(B).  Lopez is currently serving his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. MEDICAL ISSUES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Lopez' first and most dramatic claim is that he was forced to continue his trial while afflicted with a life-threatening brain tumor and while requiring a whole battery of medications to cope with various symptoms.  These medications, Lopez suggests, interfered with his ability to remember, concentrate and present himself credibly, and undermined his trial testimony.  He further asserts that the trial judge effectively compelled him to accept such medications and, without basis, charged him with malingering or attempting to over-medicate in order to frustrate the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although these are the core factual allegations, the legal claim presented has an unusual twist.  Lopez does not claim that he was \"incompetent\" to stand trial under the ordinary rubric, see Godinez v. Moran, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112898\"><a href=\"/opinion/112898/godinez-v-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2680</span></a></span>, 2685, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112898\"><a href=\"/opinion/112898/godinez-v-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span> </a></span>(1993), or that his health would be so damaged by the trial that it would be inhumane to continue.  Instead, relying primarily on Riggins v. Nevada, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112732\"><a href=\"/opinion/112732/riggins-v-nevada/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112732\"><a href=\"/opinion/112732/riggins-v-nevada/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1810</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112732\"><a href=\"/opinion/112732/riggins-v-nevada/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span> </a></span>(1992), Lopez says that the trial court \"instead of choosing a less intrusive alternative--a halt in the proceedings so that Lopez could have surgery--violated Lopez' constitutional rights by imposing a 'regime' of medication that so impaired Lopez' abilities that he was unable to testify coherently on his own behalf.\"Riggins, which the government says was not relied upon in the district court, contains language colorably pertinent to this case, but involved a fundamentally different issue.  Riggins was tried for murder and, as eight Justices viewed the facts, the trial court required Riggins to continue taking a powerful antipsychotic drug generically known as thioridazine.  Riggins' claim to the Supreme Court, after his conviction and death sentence, was that he had been compelled unconstitutionally to take this medication and that the drug concealed his true mental state from the jury and impaired his ability to present his insanity defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court held that Riggins had a substantial interest under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in \"avoiding involuntary administration of antipsychotic drugs....\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112732\"><a href=\"/opinion/112732/riggins-v-nevada/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 134, </a></span>112 S.Ct. at 1814.   Although the Court said that forced medication could sometimes be justified (e.g., to protect the defendant's health or protect others from danger), the trial judge in Riggins had made no such findings.  For this reason, and given the \"strong possibility\" or \"substantial probability\" that Riggins' defense had been impaired, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112732\"><a href=\"/opinion/112732/riggins-v-nevada/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 137-38, </a></span>112 S.Ct. at 1816-17, the Court declined to require a showing of actual prejudice and overturned the conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The concern in Riggins with forced medication is not present in this case.  Although Lopez points to the trial court's threat to revoke bail and imprison him so that a doctor could supervise his medication, the incident had nothing to do with forcing on Lopez any medication that he did not want.  The trial court thought that some of the symptoms of which Lopez was complaining (e.g., grogginess) had been induced by over-medication;  at the outset a number of doctors were prescribing different drugs, and testimony showed that over-medication might be the cause of such problems.  The record shows that Lopez himself wanted proper medication and was content to have Dr. Payne prescribe and supervise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean that Lopez is without a potential claim.  That claim, made below and adequately presented here in the course of the Riggins argument, is that the medications, necessary even if voluntarily taken, impaired Lopez' ability to present his defense.  Even assuming Lopez' \"competency,\" that being a fairly easy test to satisfy, Godinez, --- U.S. at <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112898\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">----,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112898/godinez-v-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> at <span class=\"page\">2685</span></a></span>, the threat of impairment permitted a request for a continuance.  Here, Lopez argues, the district court had a reasonable alternative that should have been adopted, namely, to postpone the trial until the operation had occurred and removed or diminished the need for drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant, especially one proposing to testify at trial about complex financial transactions, is entitled to be concerned about his fitness.  For good medical reasons, Lopez was taking a number of medications, some capable of producing side effects that could impair clarity of mind.  The drugs were designed to prevent seizures, control blood pressure, relieve pain, induce sleep, reduce agitation and prevent depression;  and they included Darvocet, ProSom, Dilantin, Vasotec, Valium, Esgic Plus and Sinequan.  At various times Lopez reported that he had severe headaches, was unable to sleep, and was suffering from memory lapses.  His lawyers protested that Lopez had problems communicating with them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez' health obviously warranted an inquiry by the trial judge.  Far from ignoring the issue, the trial court deferred trial for a substantial period, summoned medical experts one after another, took an active role in securing diagnoses for Lopez, had him re-examined repeatedly, and took testimony and made findings in abundance, including a detailed post-trial order summarizing the court's findings and reasons for proceeding with trial.  There is no need to describe the procedural steps in detail because Lopez himself does not seriously suggest that the investigation was flawed or inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The substantive issue is more difficult.  The testimony of the various doctors confirms that a number of the drugs Lopez took have the potential to cause side effects such as grogginess that could interfere with defendant's ability to present his case.  Yet the main thrust of the doctors' testimony, fairly read, was that the doctors thought that proper prescription and careful monitoring would meet these threats.  Such a monitoring regime was in place when Lopez testified.  The doctors who gave testimony raising the most doubts did so at the outset (while several doctors were prescribing drugs for Lopez, apparently without much coordination).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez' main trial counsel did protest at times that his client was not able to cooperate fully;  but these complaints of Lopez' conduct during trial are balanced, if not outweighed, by the district court's findings that Lopez appeared to be well oriented and was cooperating with counsel.  In all events, a reputable expert unaffiliated with the prosecution or defense--Dr. Payne--gave firm testimony that Lopez was fit to testify.  His testimony was based on examinations of Lopez close in time and on the monitoring of his medicine.  Even on a cold record, Dr. Payne's testimony carries conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Lopez' own testimony, which he claims suffered because of his medical condition, the evidence is inconclusive.  It is not the most organized and responsive testimony we have ever read;  but Lopez was confined by evidentiary rulings that limited him in presenting information that he and his counsel thought helpful but the trial judge thought irrelevant (e.g., such as whether the banks had sustained actual losses).  Much of the disarray in his testimony appears to be caused by such struggles between Lopez and the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no doubt that Lopez in addition was under great stress.  This is true for many criminal defendants, but surely it was augmented here by the tumor.  In a few instances Lopez' initial medication caused some adverse side effects while it was being adjusted.  On the other hand, the trial had already progressed for several weeks before Lopez' emergency room visit, and much of the medication was directed to medical symptoms--difficulty in sleeping, high blood pressure, anxiety--that could easily have continued even if the trial had been delayed and the tumor removed.  The medical advice itself largely supported the course followed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a classic instance in which the district court had to exercise its informed judgment.  In such cases, so long as sound procedures are followed, the court's ultimate judgment is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.  United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1814</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span> </span>(1990).  Whether to proceed with the trial or await the operation may well have been a hard question.  But on appeal, we think it easy to conclude that the trial judge acted within his discretion in deciding, with expert medical support and after careful investigation, to proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the suggestion that the district court was hostile to the defendant.  Most judges are suspicious of a mid-trial request for a continuance or mistrial, and the record confirms that Lopez' initial symptoms may have been caused in part by over-medication, even if inadvertent or the product of too many doctors.  Paragons may exist among trial judges who can maintain perfect discipline with perfect tact;  but for most, a certain sternness in manner and an abiding skepticism about delay are a necessary part of the arsenal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counts 1-5.   The first five counts of the indictment charged Lopez under a statute that punishes anyone who \"knowingly makes any false statement\" to influence federally insured financial institutions.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 1014.  The indictment charged, and the district court assumed, that materiality was an element of the offense.  But, as was commonly done in most circuits at the time, the trial judge resolved the materiality issue himself and did not submit it to the jury.  The defense objected to this procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following Lopez' conviction, the Supreme Court decided United States v. Gaudin, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117958\"><a href=\"/opinion/117958/united-states-v-gaudin/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span> </a></span>(1995).  There, the Court held that where materiality is an element of an offense, it must under the Sixth Amendment be submitted to the jury.  The government's main response to Gaudin is that materiality is not an element under section 1014.  Alternatively, the government says that any error was harmless because the evidence overwhelmingly proved materiality and no rational jury could have found otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has already held that section 1014 requires \"that the false statement concern[ ] a material fact.\"  United States v.

This view is consistent with that of several other circuits.  E.g. United States v. Wells, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702361\"><a href=\"/opinion/702361/united-states-v-jerry-e-wells-united-states-of-america-v-kenneth-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></a></span>, 750 (8th Cir.1995);  United States v.

Although the statute does not contain an explicit materiality requirement and the Second Circuit has held that no such requirement is to be inferred, United States v.

Most errors, including constitutional ones, are subject to harmless error analysis, Sullivan v. Louisiana, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112868\"><a href=\"/opinion/112868/sullivan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span>, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112868\"><a href=\"/opinion/112868/sullivan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span> </a></span>(1993), simply because it makes no sense to retry a case if the result will assuredly be the same.  But for various reasons, some errors are deemed fatal without proof of prejudice.  No one, for example, would think it was harmless error--no matter how conclusive the evidence of guilt--if the defendant were tried by a jury of five year olds or in a courtroom dominated by a lynch-mob.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has gone somewhat beyond such extreme cases, holding (for example) that a defective reasonable doubt instruction objected to at trial cannot be harmless error.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112868\"><a href=\"/opinion/112868/sullivan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at ---- </a></span>- <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">----,</span> <span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In all events, our best guess is that the Supreme Court would regard an omitted element reversible error per se if there were a timely objection--although not automatically \"plain error\" if no objection occurred--and this conclusion almost disposes of the government's fallback position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We say \"almost\" because the government could argue that the jury, although instructed not to, actually did decide the materiality issue when it found that Lopez did intend to influence the bank loans by false statements.  In theory, the question of purpose (the defendant's specific intent) differs from the question of materiality (whether an objective lender would be likely to be influenced by the statement).  Purpose could exist without materiality, and vice versa.  But in most cases no independent proof exists of a defendant's specific intent;  rather, the jury infers such purpose from the fact that the statement would so influence an ordinary lender.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government hints at this argument in its brief but makes no effort to show that in this case the jury must have so reasoned, a conclusion that might require a showing both that the evidence of materiality was overwhelming and that other evidence of purpose was thin or absent.  If an adequate showing were made, we would have to decide whether it would satisfy the Supreme Court.  There is some reason to think that it might, see Sullivan, 508 U.S. at <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">----,</span> <span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> at <span class=\"page\">2082</span></span>, but it will be time enough to consider this question in a case where the factual predicate is adequately developed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counts 6 and 7.   Lopez' attacks on the wire fraud convictions remain to be considered.  In his opening brief, Lopez challenged the wire fraud convictions on three grounds:  that the evidence did not show a scheme to defraud;  that the use of the wires was not in furtherance of such a scheme;  that in any event there was no proof that Lopez was responsible for any such use of the wires.  We address the points in the same order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Lopez says that the evidence does not show that there was a scheme to defraud.  He argues that the government did not show that the withdrawals from the reserve accounts were diverted to his personal use or that they were directly linked to the false invoices;  and he says that the partnerships owed him money in excess of anything withdrawn and that as a general partner he had authority to withdraw funds.  These arguments peel apart into distinct factual and legal issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with the facts, the government apparently did not prove at trial where the withdrawn money went.  But it did show that Lopez' withdrawals matched false construction-company invoices in the same amounts and that Lopez had prepared the invoices, together with false checks on the accounts purporting to pay the invoices.  Absent other evidence, the jury was entitled to infer that Lopez had employed the false documents to disguise the withdrawals and divert them to his own use.  This is enough for a scheme to defraud without proof as to where he concealed the proceeds or how he spent the money.  Cf. United States v. Yefsky, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608076\"><a href=\"/opinion/608076/united-states-v-sheldon-arthur-yefsky/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span>, 892 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the legal defenses, Lopez as manager apparently could withdraw funds for proper purposes, but the jury reasonably concluded that the purpose here was illicit.  Nor is it pertinent that the partnerships may have owed Lopez money.  The accounts in question here were restricted to repairs and other narrow uses;  and, more important, the records Lopez created gave the impression that the money had been used for repairs.  The scheme, if successful, would have enriched Lopez without reducing the ventures' apparent obligations to Lopez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Lopez says that the evidence did not show that the wires--the basis for federal jurisdiction--were used in furtherance of the scheme.  The money, he notes, was withdrawn in 1988;  and the faxes, responding to inquiries about the withdrawals, occurred in late 1990 and early 1991.  Lopez concludes that if any fraud occurred, it was completed long before the faxes were ever sent.  No other use of wires was alleged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law requires that the use of the wires must be \"incident to an essential part of the scheme,\" Pereira v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105186\"><a href=\"/opinion/105186/pereira-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105186\"><a href=\"/opinion/105186/pereira-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span>, 362, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span> </span>(1954), but the cases have stretched that concept to include use of the wires in attempts \" 'to lull the victims into a sense of false security, postpone their ultimate complaint to the authorities, and therefore make the apprehension of the defendants less likely.' \"  United States v. Lane, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111560\"><a href=\"/opinion/111560/united-states-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span>, 451-52, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111560\"><a href=\"/opinion/111560/united-states-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">814</span> </a></span>(1986) (quoting an earlier decision).  It is hard to see why the jury could not find that the faxes in this case do not fit that description.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez says that the faxes do not explicitly refer to the withdrawals and that they refer to events after 1988 and so could not justify the withdrawals.  But the faxes were sent in response to inquiries that did refer to the withdrawals and it is not a complete answer to say that the faxes were not directly responsive to the inquiries.  Rather, the responses could be read as attempts to talk around the issue, to confuse matters, and ultimately to delay or avoid detection.  This permissible inference satisfies the Lane criterion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Lopez says that the government failed to prove that he sent the December 1990 fax (count 6) or that the January 1991 document (count 7) was transmitted by wire.  The former was sent from the accounting firm used by Four Winds Rental and an accountant testified that he faxed the letter as a \"courtesy for ... Mr. Lopez\" because \"either he or someone from his office was in--in our office that day.\"   The letter is not signed but the accompanying cover sheet, prepared by the accounting firm, says that the letter is from Lopez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quite apart from the cover sheet, the content of the letter reveals that it is a response to the earlier letter of inquiry to Lopez.  The wording of the letter is substantially the same as the subsequent letter of January 14, 1991, which was signed by Lopez.  It was a fair inference that Lopez had also composed the earlier letter and either directed the accountant to fax it or sent someone in his employ to do so.  All that is required is that Lopez caused the letter to be faxed and the jury could find that he did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the January 1991 letter, Lopez does not deny authorship but questions the proof that it had been faxed.  The letter was found in the files of Capital Management Strategies together with a page bearing the phrases \"Telefax Communication\" and \"Fax Cover Sheet\" as well as the Four Winds logo;  and the page describes Lopez as the sender and bears the same date as the letter.  This is adequate circumstantial evidence that the document was faxed and serves to distinguish United States v. Srulowitz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"466086\"><a href=\"/opinion/466086/united-states-v-abraham-srulowitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">785</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span> </a></span>(2d Cir.1986), where no circumstantial evidence showed that a letter found in a file had been mailed to a third party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez contends in his reply brief that the Gaudin decision also requires reversal of his convictions for wire fraud.  The government charged that Lopez had used interstate wires in furtherance of a scheme to obtain money by means of false representations, thereby violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343.  Lopez says that such false representations must be material and that it was error not to so instruct the jury and require it to find materiality.  The government says that this issue was not preserved, but Gaudin is a recent and not entirely predictable decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the merits, Lopez' argument confronts an initial difficulty.  In United States v. Faulhaber, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558020\"><a href=\"/opinion/558020/fed-sec-l-rep-p-95907-united-states-v-thomas-a-faulhaber/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.1991), this court found no materiality requirement in the substantially identical federal mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341, stating that the jury was not required to find that the scheme would have defrauded a person of \"ordinary prudence and comprehension.\"  Faulhaber 's position is at odds with some circuits and with both of the standard instruction treatises.  E.g., United States v. Dunn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581417\"><a href=\"/opinion/581417/united-states-v-daniel-k-dunn-sr/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span></a></span>, 651 (7th Cir.1992);  1A L.Sand, J. Siffert, W. Loughlin &amp; S. Reiss, Modern Federal Jury Instructions Sec. 44.01 (1995).  But whether Faulhaber warrants re-examination is a subject for another occasion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our case, the district court did instruct the jury that a \"scheme to defraud\" required that the \"plan [be one] reasonably calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence and comprehension by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\"   This language embodies the materiality standard.  The only deceptive conduct charged under counts 6 and 7 involved false or fraudulent documents, so it hardly matters that the \"reasonably calculated\" and \"ordinary prudence\" language referred to the word \"plan\" rather than the false statements.  In short, assuming that materiality is an element in wire fraud, the issue was effectively submitted to the jury in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. GOVERNMENT MISCONDUCT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial, Lopez filed a motion alleging government misconduct and seeking to have the indictment dismissed, or at least to obtain additional discovery and an evidentiary hearing.  He claimed that he was a victim of vindictive and selective prosecution and that the indictment had been tainted by a conflict of interest on the part of a former Assistant United States Attorney who had played a minor role in the investigation of Lopez and later served for a period as Lopez' defense counsel prior to indictment.  The district court denied this motion.  United States v. Lopez, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span> </span>(D.P.R.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the claim of improper prosecution.  Lopez told the district court that he had been prosecuted because he refused to use his political influence in favor of the reappointment of a former U.S. Attorney for Puerto Rico.  Further, he claimed that defendants in his position are normally pursued civilly on false statement claims, so the prosecution was selective as well as vindictive.  His evidence on the first point was thin;  on the second, the government offered the district court evidence that Lopez' case did fall within its guidelines for criminal prosecutions because of the amounts involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Lopez has condensed his argument on the claim of improper prosecution to a couple of sentences and a pair of footnotes.  The arguments are used primarily to add color to his other claim of government misconduct, relating to the dual role of the lawyer who allegedly represented first the government and then Lopez in the same matter.  Arguments not seriously developed on appeal are waived, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Zannino,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, and in this instance we also think that a deliberate, and reasonable, strategy choice was made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, those charges of selective and vindictive prosecution indirectly concern the integrity of the judicial process.  We have therefore reviewed with care the pertinent filings in the district court, the district court's lengthy discussion of the subject, what little Lopez has to say about the matter on appeal, and the government's more extensive rebuttal.  Although the waiver relieves us of the need to set out the facts in detail, we comment briefly on each branch of Lopez' claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not ignore the serious charges of blackmail made against certain members of the U.S. Attorney's office, but analyzed the proffered evidence with care.  This evidence consisted primarily of hearsay and conjecture, and the district court after scrutiny found it insufficient to require an evidentiary hearing.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Lopez,</span> <span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">45-46</span></span>.   The district court's judgment call was not unreasonable on its face, especially where as here the vindictive prosecution claim falls outside the narrow area where such a claim traditionally has been recognized, e.g., United States v. Garza-Juarez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606075\"><a href=\"/opinion/606075/united-states-of-america-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-joe/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">896</span></a></span>, 905 (9th Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">688</span> </span>(1994), and where the prosecution itself was conducted by a new U.S. Attorney not implicated by Lopez' allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for selective prosecution, the district court asked the government for information about its prosecution policy.  The government supplied the data and the court ruled that Lopez had not made out a colorable claim of discriminatory treatment.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 44. </span>  Nor is it surprising to us that the government would prosecute criminally a charge of multiple false loan applications totalling a considerable sum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government-misconduct claim that Lopez does argue at length on appeal concerns Luis Plaza Lopez.  According to the allegations, Plaza, while serving as an Assistant United States Attorney, began the grand jury investigation of Lopez in February 1992, and took a small number of steps in the inquiry before leaving the government in November 1992.  Plaza then began representing Lopez in dealing with the government's investigation.  Lopez asserts that he did not know of Plaza's prior role in his case.  Plaza ceased representing Lopez a year later, before Lopez was indicted, after a new United States Attorney raised questions about Plaza's dual role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If after leaving the government Plaza worked on the other side of the same matter, this would normally constitute a violation of federal law.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 207.  But ordinarily the injured party would be the original client, here the government, which would be entitled to fear that confidential information might now be used against it by its own former lawyer.  The district court made this point in declining to convene an evidentiary hearing on this matter.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Lopez,</span> <span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">49</span></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez responds by saying that he was himself prejudiced because Plaza must have carried into his new employment his prosecutor's judgment that Lopez was guilty.  Lopez cites us to case law holding that, for just this reason, a judge cannot sit on a matter on which he worked as a prosecutor.  United States v. Arnpriester, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679602\"><a href=\"/opinion/679602/united-states-v-paul-richard-arnpriester/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 467 (9th Cir.1994).  The analogy is not very persuasive.  The judge, who is supposed to be impartial, is disqualified because his prior connection with one side renders his present impartiality suspect.  An attorney is expected to be loyal, not impartial, and after switching sides has ample inducement to act in the interest of the attorney's new client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But--Lopez counters--in this case Plaza, while serving as Lopez' attorney, told Lopez that the government prosecutors might drop charges if Lopez supported one of them for the then open post of U.S. Attorney.  The implication is that Plaza was working as an agent for prosecutors, thus depriving Lopez of his constitutional right to independent counsel.  Assuming that Plaza ever conveyed such a message to Lopez, Plaza's role was that of a go-between and was apparent to Lopez.  The suggestion that Plaza therefore had divided loyalties or was a government agent is rhetoric.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez' most straightforward complaint is that the prosecutors, when they discovered that Plaza was now appearing on Lopez' side, should have immediately disclosed to Lopez Plaza's prior involvement as prosecutor in the same case.  Lopez cites us to cases where the government has by its silence improperly reaped an advantage from disloyal acts of private defense counsel in cooperation with the government.  E.g., United States v. Marshank, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1507</span> </span>(N.D.Cal.1991).  But there is no indication that the government gained any advantage from delay in disclosing Plaza's former affiliation, if undue delay there was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main job of the trial judge in a criminal case is to try the defendant, and there is always a tension when the defense seeks to shift the focus to charges of improprieties or wrongdoing by the government.  Where there are plausible claims of government misconduct prejudicing the rights of the defendant, the district court cannot ignore them;  but how far to pursue them, and in what manner, depends upon circumstances, and the judge on the scene has considerable latitude.

Ortiz-Arrigoitia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609732\"><a href=\"/opinion/609732/united-states-v-luis-e-ortiz-arrigoitia-aka-colibri-united-states-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 442-43 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span> </span>(1994).  Here, the trial judge looked about for big fish, saw none, and let the red herrings go.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. SENTENCING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez was sentenced pursuant to the November 1, 1990, edition of the Sentencing Guidelines (all subsequent references are to that edition).  The seven counts of conviction were grouped, U.S.S.G. Sec. 3D1.2, and Lopez' sentence was calculated under section 2F1.1, which prescribes a base offense level of 6 for offenses involving fraud or deceit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main variable under section 2F1.1 is the amount of \"loss\" inflicted or intended, and the district court calculated the total loss for the seven counts as $6,689,051, requiring an increase of 14 levels.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1)(O).  The district court added six additional levels, representing two levels each for more than minimal planning, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Sec. 2F1.1(b)(2), </span>abuse of a position of trust, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Sec. 3B1.3, </span>and obstruction of justice for committing perjury during trial, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Sec. 3C1.1</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The resulting total base offense level was 26 (6 plus 14 plus 6).  Lopez had no prior convictions and, given a criminal history category of I, his offense level of 26 corresponds to a guideline range of 63 to 78 months' imprisonment.  The court chose to construct the 63-month sentence by imposing concurrent sentences of 24 months on count 1 (the conduct underlying this count occurred when an earlier version of section 1014 was in effect that provided for a two-year maximum sentence), 63 months each on counts 2 through 5, and 60 months each on counts 6 and 7 (there being a 60-month statutory maximum on those last two counts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez has not challenged the base offense level or the six-level adjustment for planning, abuse of trust or obstruction.  He does challenge the loss calculations on counts 1 through 5, and on certain of his claims the government suggests a remand.  Having reversed convictions on those false statement counts, we have no reason to consider the claims of error as to sentences on those counts.  Our concern is limited to Lopez' separate attacks on the calculations as to counts 6 and 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The broader of the two challenges made by Lopez to his sentence on counts 6 and 7 is that the government failed to show either an actual or an intended loss to the partnerships because Lopez was charged with having improperly withdrawn $308,481 from the partnerships' reserve accounts in 1988 and the same year the partnerships allegedly owed Lopez $741,000.  Lopez' brief reasons that the \"withdrawal of monies that were owed to him ... did not cause the partnerships any 'actual' economic loss,\" nor can there have been any intended loss because \"here, the alleged crime was complete yet there still was no loss.\"   The argument is clever but unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a defendant had picked the pocket of a victim in a crowded elevator, gaining $10 in the process, it would not be a defense when the $10 loss figure was attributed to the defendant at sentencing to say that the victim happened to owe the defendant an even larger sum.  As long as a theft or diversion is concealed or disguised, the victim has no reason to think that its debt has been reduced.  In this sense the loss caused by Lopez was both actual and intended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez' second argument is less ambiguous but may have more substance.  It is common ground that the amount withdrawn by Lopez from the partnerships' reserve accounts was $308,481.  This was the amount charged in the indictment and, interestingly, it is the figure specified by the district court in its order requiring restitution, an order that Lopez has not challenged.  Yet in reliance on the probation report, the district court found a loss of $436,176 attributable to the wire fraud counts;  and as we shall see the difference between the two figures may matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probation officer originally calculated the loss on counts 6 and 7 as $308,481 but thereafter a letter containing a victim impact statement was received from Capital Management Strategies claiming a loss of $632,917.  The probation officer deducted various amounts from this larger figure concluding that they did not reflect losses imposed by Lopez.  The amount left was $436,276, which the probation officer and the district court adopted as the loss attributable to counts 6 and 7.  The victim impact statement was not attached to the pre-sentencing report so the basis for the claimed total loss of $632,917 is difficult to discern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the discrepancy between the original and adjusted figures for the loss on counts 6 and 7 did not loom large, since both figures were dwarfed by the losses on counts 1 through 5;  whether the loss of counts 6 and 7 was $308,481 or $436,176, the total loss on all counts appeared to be within the $5 to $10 million range for which a 14-level increase was required.  Nevertheless, at sentencing defense counsel took a swipe at the victim impact statement, calling it \"a letter that has been alluded to in the pre-sentence report.  No live body, no documentation.... and to indicate that there are $436,376 in the losses as a result of that, I believe, is--is improper.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Lopez says that the letter in question was not disclosed to him, despite a request, and argues that the trial judge \"failed to exercise independent judgment but relied mechanically on a non-disclosed hearsay document referred to very generally in the pre-sentence report....\"  The government responds that in this circuit reliable hearsay can be used at sentencing, including hearsay adopted by a pre-sentence report.  See United States v. Tardiff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587242\"><a href=\"/opinion/587242/united-states-v-claude-paul-tardiff/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1283</span></a></span>, 1287 (1st Cir.1992).  Lopez then says that the victim impact statement had no indicia of reliability, a point difficult to resolve since it is not before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not necessary to decide these issues in the abstract because the case must in all events be remanded for resentencing.  The bulk of the losses, and thus a significant part of Lopez' sentence on counts 6 and 7, rests on amounts attributed to the counts that we have reversed.  The government has not given us any reason to think that the losses for counts 1 through 5 can be attributed to Lopez in a resentencing on counts 6 and 7.  The possibility that it may retry Lopez on counts 1 through 5 is irrelevant at present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The base offense level for counts 6 and 7 and the six-level increase have not been challenged on appeal, so the only question is the amount of loss.  The difference between the two alternative figures here is significant;  the $308,481 figure would seemingly produce a total offense level of 20 and a sentencing range of 33-41 months, while the larger $436,276 figure would produce a total offense level of 21 and a range of 37-46 months.  Although one might construct a technical argument to defend the use of the larger figure (e.g., because Lopez did not counter the report with evidence), we think that simple justice suggests that this is the wrong course to follow, especially since resentencing is required in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If on remand the government wants to rely on the larger of the two figures, the victim impact statement should be made available to Lopez' counsel prior to resentencing.  Whether the government wants to support the larger figure with any other kind of evidence, and whether Lopez wants to seek an evidentiary hearing at which the maker of the victim impact statement can be cross-examined, are matters for the future.  What we will not do is uphold on this record the use of the larger figure where a procedural flaw arguably exists and we ourselves cannot discern the basis for the figure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The convictions and sentences on counts 1 through 5 are vacated;  the government may retry the defendant on those counts or not, as it chooses.  The convictions on counts 6 and 7 are affirmed but the sentences imposed on those counts are vacated and the case remanded for resentencing on those counts of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
