We\r\n\naffirm the dismissal.\r\n\n          Plaintiff has  failed to show a  deprivation of any\r\n\nfederal or constitutional right, an essential element  of a  \r\n\n1983  cause of  action.   None of plaintiff's  filings allege\r\n\nfacts  indicating  that  Massachusetts  fails  to  provide  a\r\n\nconstitutionally adequate remedy to redress the purported due\r\n\nprocess  deprivation, here,  the non-renewals  of plaintiff's\r\n\nlicense  to operate  and  automobile registration.   Such  an\r\n\nallegation is critical to a procedural due process claim, and\r\n\nits  omission  warrants dismissal  of  that  claim.

L. ch.  90,   20A 1/2, clearly  provides\r\n\npredeprivation  safeguards  to avert  erroneous non-renewals.\r\n\nIt is  the  issuance  of  parking  tickets  that  triggers  a\r\n\npotential  non-renewal.    Aside from  the  unelaborated  and\r\n\nconclusory  assertion  that    20A  1/2  is unconstitutional,\r\n\nplaintiff  failed completely  to indicate  in what  way those\r\n\nstatutory  safeguards  are   inadequate  or  what  additional\r\n\nprocess  is required to challenge  the ticketing in the first\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ninstance.    Given the  express  provisions of  ch.  20A 1/2,\r\n\nadequate predeprivation  process was available.   See Lowe v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nScott, 959 F.2d 323, 344 (1st Cir. 1992).\r                 \r\n\n          Further, Massachusetts appears to  provide adequate\r\n\npostdeprivation tort  remedies.

Without  facts\r\n\nshowing  the inadequacy of  the  Massachusetts predeprivation\r\n\nand postdeprivation remedies, plaintiff cannot state a   1983\r\n\nprocedural due  process claim.1   Rumford Pharmacy,  970 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\nat  1000;  see  also  Campo   v.

Because plaintiff has  failed\r\n\nto plead an actionable  claim of deprivation of due  process,\r\n\nhis ancillary    1985  conspiracy claim necessarily  fails as\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.

Cunningham, 9\r                                                                      \r\nF.3d 168, 173 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nwell.

To the extent that plaintiff's conspiracy theory attempts\r\nto rely  on  grounds  other than due  process, such  as equal\r\nprotection  or the  First Amendment,  plaintiff's speculative\r\nand improbable conspiracy claim--that he has been singled out\r\nby defendants because of his previous litigation or political\r\nviews--fails to identify facts that could support the kind of\r\nracial  or class-based  animus required  to obtain    1985(3)\r\nrelief,   and  is   plainly  without   merit.
