Defendant-appellant Wesley  Mottram\n                     \n\npleaded guilty  to a  one-count indictment charging  him with\n\npassing  a  United  States   Treasury  check  with  a  forged\n\nendorsement, in violation of 18 U.S.C.   510(a)(2).  Imposing\n\nsentence  under  the  United  States   Sentencing  Guidelines\n\n(\"U.S.S.G.\"), the  district court, departing upward  from the\n\napplicable guideline range, sentenced  Mottram to an 18-month\n\nprison term in a  facility with a substance abuse  program, a\n\n3-year  term  of  supervised  release during  which  he  must\n\nparticipate in a substance  abuse program, restitution in the\n\namount  of $  1,303,  and an  assessment of  $  50.   Mottram\n\nappeals from this sentence.  We affirm.\n\n                      Background\n                                \n\n          The  presentence  investigation report  (\"the PSR\")\n\nrecounted  a long  and  extensive criminal  history extending\n\nfrom the 1960's through the instant offense.  Neither Mottram\n\nnor  his counsel raised any objections to this account.  Many\n\nof these prior  convictions, moreover, did not result  in the\n\nassignment  of  criminal  history points  against  Mottram.  \n\nThus,  the PSR  stated  that  an  upward departure  might  be\n\nwarranted in  view of the  sheer number of  prior convictions\n\nand  the  \"extreme  likelihood\"  that  Mottram  would  commit\n\nfurther crimes.\n\n          There  were  two  reasons  why many  of  the  prior\n\nconvictions did not produce criminal history points.  For one\n\nthing,  convictions over ten years old that did not involve a\n\nsentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month  do\n\nnot result in criminal history  points.  U.S.S.G.   4A1.2(e).\n\nA  number of  Mottram's  convictions fell  outside this  time\n\nlimitation:    six  separate convictions  for  driving  while\n\nintoxicated,  plus  separate  convictions  for  breaking  and\n\nentering, assault, possessing marijuana, and resisting arrest\n\nand contempt of court.  \n\n          Second, a  prior  conviction  that  resulted  in  a\n\nsentence of less than 60 days' imprisonment adds one criminal\n\nhistory  point, but  not  to exceed  a  total of  4  criminal\n\nhistory  points  for  all  such  convictions.       4A1.1(c).\n                         \n\nMottram,  however, has had far more  than four convictions in\n\nthis category.  In fact, the  PSR lists no fewer than  twelve\n\nseparate convictions, all in 1991 or 1992,  for which Mottram\n\nreceived no  criminal history points because  all resulted in\n\nsentences of  less than 60 days'  imprisonment (most resulted\n\nin  suspended sentences or  probation).  Almost  all of these\n\nconvictions  involved  offenses  of receiving  stolen  goods,\n\nobtaining  money  under  false  pretences,   or  forgery  and\n\ncounterfeiting.\n\n          The district court,  following the  recommendations\n\nof  the PSR, determined Mottram's total offense level to be 4\n\n                             -3-\n\n-- a base offense level of 6 under U.S.S.G.   2F1.1(b)(1)(A),\n\nwith   a  subtraction   of   2  points   for  acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility under   3E1.1.  The district court assigned 14\n\ncriminal  history  points on  the  basis  of Mottram's  prior\n\nconvictions, and  added 2 additional points  under   4A1.1(d)\n\nbecause Mottram  was serving a  suspended sentence on  a 1990\n\nstate conviction  for assault  at the  time he committed  the\n\ninstant  offense.  This  total of 16  criminal history points\n\nplaced Mottram in criminal history category VI.     5A.  This\n\noffense level of  4 and  criminal history category  of VI  --\n\nwhich  Mottram does not challenge -- would produce a range of\n\nimprisonment of 6 to 12 months.  Id.\n                                   \n\n          Thus, even though many of his prior convictions did\n\nnot yield criminal history points, Mottram nonetheless was in\n\nthe highest criminal history category, VI.  Adding additional\n\ncriminal history points could not have placed him in a higher\n\ncategory.\n\n          The  district court  decided to depart  upward from\n\nthis guideline range on the ground  that the criminal history\n\ncategory VI  --  although the  highest  category --  did  not\n\nadequately reflect the seriousness of Mottram's past criminal\n\nconduct or the likelihood of recidivism.  The district  court\n\nexplained the upward departure as follows:  \"I don't know how\n\nmany instances [prior convictions] there are here but I guess\n\nthey number  34.   Thirty-four convictions.   The last  three\n\n                             -4-\n\nyears  it's  been either  cashing  stolen  checks or  writing\n\nchecks on accounts that  don't exist. . . .   In light of the\n\nnumber  of offenses  here,  the persistent  criminal  conduct\n\nwhich nothing seems to deter, it seems to me appropriate that\n\nthe  offense level  be increased  by two  to a level  of six.\n\nThat's a guideline range of 12 to 18 months.\"\n\n          Mottram's counsel  argued that  there should  be no\n\nupward departure, and indeed that there should  be a downward\n\ndeparture,  because   Mottram  has  a   persistent,  episodic\n\ndrinking  problem,  and  because  most  of  Mottram's   prior\n\noffenses  occurred  during  particular  periods  of excessive\n\ndrinking.    Counsel further  noted  that  most of  Mottram's\n\noffenses  do not  involve violence or  a threat  of violence.\n\nThe important thing, counsel urged, was to require Mottram to\n\nobtain alchohol counselling.\n\n          In  rejecting these  arguments, the  district court\n\nremarked, \"I have a  lot of trouble figuring out how  if your\n\ndrinking  causes this  problem that  you can be  doing things\n\nlike  this while you're drinking.  It  seems to me it takes a\n\nlittle bit  of skill, a little bit of  guile to be able to go\n\ninto a  bank and cash a check and I doubt that, I don't know,\n\nI  suppose  somebody  would  have  difficulty  if  they  were\n\nintoxicated and doing that.\"\n\n                             -5-\n\n                          The Merits\n                                    \n\nThere is no dispute on appeal over whether the evidence\n\nsupports the departure-related  findings of fact,  see United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Rivera,  994 F.2d 942, 950 (1st Cir. 1993), or over\n                \n\nthe degree of departure, see id.  The only issue in this case\n                               \n\nis  whether the specific departure-related circumstances here\n\n\"are  of  a kind  or degree  that  they may  appropriately be\n\nrelied  upon  to justify  departure.\"    Id. (quoting  United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Diaz-Villafane, 874  F.2d 43, 49 (1st  Cir.), cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied, 493 U.S. 862 (1989)).\n      \n\n          U.S.S.G.    4A1.3 states,  \"A departure under  this\n\nprovision  is warranted  when the  criminal history  category\n\nsignificantly   under-represents   the  seriousness   of  the\n\ndefendant's  criminal  history  or  the likelihood  that  the\n\ndefendant will commit  further crimes.\"  This section goes on\n\nto  specifically  discuss  departures  from  criminal history\n\ncategory VI:  \n\n        \"The Commission contemplates that  there may,\n        on  occasion,  be  a  case  of an  egregious,\n        serious criminal  record  in which  even  the\n        guideline range for Criminal History Category\n        VI is not adequate to reflect the seriousness\n        of the defendant's criminal history.  In such\n        a case, a departure above the guideline range\n        for   a   defendant  with   Criminal  History\n        Category VI may be warranted.  In determining\n        whether  an  upward  departure from  Criminal\n        History Category  VI is warranted,  the court\n        should consider that the  nature of the prior\n        offenses rather than  simply their number  is\n\n                             -6-\n\n        often more indicative  of the seriousness  of\n        the defendant's criminal record.\"\n\n          Mottram argues that  although he may have had a lot\n\nof prior convictions that did not contribute  to his criminal\n\nhistory points  or category, these were  all relatively minor\n\noffenses that did not  involve violence.  In  this situation,\n\naccording  to   Mottram,   the  Sentencing   Commission   has\n\ndiscouraged  departures  by stating  that  \"the court  should\n\nconsider that the  nature of the  prior offenses rather  than\n\nsimply  their   number  is  often  more   indicative  of  the\n\nseriousness of the defendant's criminal record.\"       4A1.3.\n\nThe  district court thus erred in relying solely on the sheer\n\nnumber of prior convictions to justify an upward departure.\n\n          We find this argument unpersuasive.  For one thing,\n\nthe  Sentencing  Commission's   policy  statement  does   not\n\npreclude a sentencing  judge from giving weight to  the sheer\n\nnumber  of prior  convictions,  even  though relatively  non-\n\nserious.   The  Commission has  said that  the nature  of the\n\nprior offenses \"is  often more  indicative\" (emphasis  added)\n                         \n\nthan their  number.  Obviously, this  formulation leaves open\n\nthe possibility  that nonetheless there may  be situations in\n\nwhich an upward departure might be appropriate because of the\n\nsheer number of prior convictions.\n\n          In any event, the sentencing judge here plainly did\n\nnot rely  solely on  the sheer number  of prior  convictions.\n\nThe judge  expressly noted  the spate of  recent convictions,\n                                                \n\n                             -7-\n\nmost of them not resulting in any actual time  in prison, for\n\noffenses very  similar to the instant  offense, i.e., passing\n\nstolen  or forged  checks.    From  this,  as  well  as  from\n\nMottram's long  history  of  repeating  other  categories  of\n\ncrimes, the  district court concluded that  the likelihood of\n\nMottram  committing  further  offenses  involving  stolen  or\n\nforged  checks was  very high.   Indeed,  the  district court\n\nconcluded that  it  was so  high that  placement in  Criminal\n\nHistory Category VI did not take adequate account of it.  \n\n          We see  no reason  to disturb the  district court's\n\neminently  reasonable  assessment.    Section  4A1.3  of  the\n\nSentencing  Guidelines   expressly  states  that   an  upward\n\ndeparture \"is  warranted when  the criminal  history category\n\nsignificantly under-represents . .  . the likelihood that the\n\ndefendant  will commit  further  crimes.\"   We  have made  it\n\nclear, moreover, that  we will accord deference to a district\n\ncourt's departure  determination insofar as  it reflects  the\n\ndistrict court's  sentencing experience,  as  opposed to  the\n\n\"quintessentially  legal  interpretation  of the  words  of a\n\nguideline.\"  Rivera, supra,  994 F.2d at 951.

Sec. 510(a)(2).  Imposing sentence under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\"), the district court, departing upward from the applicable guideline range, sentenced Mottram to an 18-month prison term in a facility with a substance abuse program, a 3- year term of supervised release during which he must participate in a substance abuse program, restitution in the amount of $ 1,303, and an assessment of $ 50.  Mottram appeals from this sentence.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presentence investigation report (\"the PSR\") recounted a long and extensive criminal history extending from the 1960's through the instant offense.  Neither Mottram nor his counsel raised any objections to this account.  Many of these prior convictions, moreover, did not result in the assignment of criminal history points against Mottram.  Thus, the PSR stated that an upward departure might be warranted in view of the sheer number of prior convictions and the \"extreme likelihood\" that Mottram would commit further crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were two reasons why many of the prior convictions did not produce criminal history points.  For one thing, convictions over ten years old that did not involve a sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month do not result in criminal history points.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2(e).  A number of Mottram's convictions fell outside this time limitation:  six separate convictions for driving while intoxicated, plus separate convictions for breaking and entering, assault, possessing marijuana, and resisting arrest and contempt of court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, a prior conviction that resulted in a sentence of less than 60 days' imprisonment adds one criminal history point, but not to exceed a total of 4 criminal history points for all such convictions.  Sec.  4A1.1(c).  Mottram, however, has had far more than four convictions in this category.  In fact, the PSR lists no fewer than twelve separate convictions, all in 1991 or 1992, for which Mottram received no criminal history points because all resulted in sentences of less than 60 days' imprisonment (most resulted in suspended sentences or probation).  Almost all of these convictions involved offenses of receiving stolen goods, obtaining money under false pretences, or forgery and counterfeiting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, following the recommendations of the PSR, determined Mottram's total offense level to be 4-a base offense level of 6 under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1)(A), with a subtraction of 2 points for acceptance of responsibility under Sec. 3E1.1.  The district court assigned 14 criminal history points on the basis of Mottram's prior convictions, and added 2 additional points under Sec. 4A1.1(d) because Mottram was serving a suspended sentence on a 1990 state conviction for assault at the time he committed the instant offense.  This total of 16 criminal history points placed Mottram in criminal history category VI. Sec. 5A. This offense level of 4 and criminal history category of VI-which Mottram does not challenge-would produce a range of imprisonment of 6 to 12 months.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, even though many of his prior convictions did not yield criminal history points, Mottram nonetheless was in the highest criminal history category, VI.  Adding additional criminal history points could not have placed him in a higher category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court decided to depart upward from this guideline range on the ground that the criminal history category VI-although the highest category-did not adequately reflect the seriousness of Mottram's past criminal conduct or the likelihood of recidivism.  The district court explained the upward departure as follows:  \"I don't know how many instances [prior convictions] there are here but I guess they number 34.  Thirty-four convictions.  The last three years it's been either cashing stolen checks or writing checks on accounts that don't exist....  In light of the number of offenses here, the persistent criminal conduct which nothing seems to deter, it seems to me appropriate that the offense level be increased by two to a level of six.  That's a guideline range of 12 to 18 months.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mottram's counsel argued that there should be no upward departure, and indeed that there should be a downward departure, because Mottram has a persistent, episodic drinking problem, and because most of Mottram's prior offenses occurred during particular periods of excessive drinking.  Counsel further noted that most of Mottram's offenses do not involve violence or a threat of violence.  The important thing, counsel urged, was to require Mottram to obtain alcohol counselling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In rejecting these arguments, the district court remarked, \"I have a lot of trouble figuring out how if your drinking causes this problem that you can be doing things like this while you're drinking.

From this, as well as from Mottram's long history of repeating other categories of crimes, the district court concluded that the likelihood of Mottram committing further offenses involving stolen or forged checks was very high.

Sec. 510(a)(2).  Imposing sentence under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\"), the district court, departing upward from the applicable guideline range, sentenced Mottram to an 18-month prison term in a facility with a substance abuse program, a 3- year term of supervised release during which he must participate in a substance abuse program, restitution in the amount of $ 1,303, and an assessment of $ 50.  Mottram appeals from this sentence.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presentence investigation report (\"the PSR\") recounted a long and extensive criminal history extending from the 1960's through the instant offense.  Neither Mottram nor his counsel raised any objections to this account.  Many of these prior convictions, moreover, did not result in the assignment of criminal history points against Mottram.  Thus, the PSR stated that an upward departure might be warranted in view of the sheer number of prior convictions and the \"extreme likelihood\" that Mottram would commit further crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were two reasons why many of the prior convictions did not produce criminal history points.  For one thing, convictions over ten years old that did not involve a sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month do not result in criminal history points.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2(e).  A number of Mottram's convictions fell outside this time limitation:  six separate convictions for driving while intoxicated, plus separate convictions for breaking and entering, assault, possessing marijuana, and resisting arrest and contempt of court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, a prior conviction that resulted in a sentence of less than 60 days' imprisonment adds one criminal history point, but not to exceed a total of 4 criminal history points for all such convictions.  Sec.  4A1.1(c).  Mottram, however, has had far more than four convictions in this category.  In fact, the PSR lists no fewer than twelve separate convictions, all in 1991 or 1992, for which Mottram received no criminal history points because all resulted in sentences of less than 60 days' imprisonment (most resulted in suspended sentences or probation).  Almost all of these convictions involved offenses of receiving stolen goods, obtaining money under false pretences, or forgery and counterfeiting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, following the recommendations of the PSR, determined Mottram's total offense level to be 4-a base offense level of 6 under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1)(A), with a subtraction of 2 points for acceptance of responsibility under Sec. 3E1.1.  The district court assigned 14 criminal history points on the basis of Mottram's prior convictions, and added 2 additional points under Sec. 4A1.1(d) because Mottram was serving a suspended sentence on a 1990 state conviction for assault at the time he committed the instant offense.  This total of 16 criminal history points placed Mottram in criminal history category VI. Sec. 5A. This offense level of 4 and criminal history category of VI-which Mottram does not challenge-would produce a range of imprisonment of 6 to 12 months.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, even though many of his prior convictions did not yield criminal history points, Mottram nonetheless was in the highest criminal history category, VI.  Adding additional criminal history points could not have placed him in a higher category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court decided to depart upward from this guideline range on the ground that the criminal history category VI-although the highest category-did not adequately reflect the seriousness of Mottram's past criminal conduct or the likelihood of recidivism.  The district court explained the upward departure as follows:  \"I don't know how many instances [prior convictions] there are here but I guess they number 34.  Thirty-four convictions.  The last three years it's been either cashing stolen checks or writing checks on accounts that don't exist....  In light of the number of offenses here, the persistent criminal conduct which nothing seems to deter, it seems to me appropriate that the offense level be increased by two to a level of six.  That's a guideline range of 12 to 18 months.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mottram's counsel argued that there should be no upward departure, and indeed that there should be a downward departure, because Mottram has a persistent, episodic drinking problem, and because most of Mottram's prior offenses occurred during particular periods of excessive drinking.  Counsel further noted that most of Mottram's offenses do not involve violence or a threat of violence.  The important thing, counsel urged, was to require Mottram to obtain alcohol counselling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In rejecting these arguments, the district court remarked, \"I have a lot of trouble figuring out how if your drinking causes this problem that you can be doing things like this while you're drinking.  It seems to me it takes a little bit of skill, a little bit of guile to be able to go into a bank and cash a check and I doubt that, I don't know, I suppose somebody would have difficulty if they were intoxicated and doing that.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no dispute on appeal over whether the evidence supports the departure-related findings of fact,  see United States v.
