After recognizing one of the men as a \"drug\n\npoint,\"  the officer  maintained surveillance  and  saw appellant\n\nstanding  in  close proximity  to a  vehicle from  which packages\n\nwrapped in brown paper were being removed.  The officer suspected\n\nthat the  packages contained cocaine.   Shortly thereafter appel-\n\nlant  was  seen getting  into a  vehicle  and circling  the park.\n\nAfter appellant rejoined the group, the police moved in to arrest\n\nthem. \n\n          Appellant was arrested while  attempting to flee.  More\n\nthan $1,000  in cash  was seized  from his  person, and an  empty\n\npaper  bag     bearing  the notation  \"$1,500  for Kike\"      was\n\nrecovered from one of  the seized vehicles.2  Over  255 kilograms\n\nof  cocaine  were recovered  from the  vehicles  at the  scene   \n\ntwenty-five kilograms from  the vehicle used by  appellant    all\n                    \r                              \n\n     1The relevant  facts are recited in the light most favorable\nto the verdict.   United States v. Tuesta-Toro, 29  F.3d 771, 773\r                                                        \n(1st Cir. 1994).\n\n     2The  government  established  that  \"Kike\"  was appellant's\nnickname. \n\n                                2\r\r\n\nin similarly  wrapped one-kilo  packages.  Following  a three-day\n\njury trial, appellant was convicted and sentenced to life impris-\n\nonment.  This appeal ensued.\n\n                                II\r                                          II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \n\nA.   Sufficiency of the Evidence \r          A.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\r                                          \n\n          Appellant  challenges the  sufficiency of  the evidence\n\nsupporting his  conviction for possessing cocaine  with intent to\n\ndistribute.  We review  the evidence in the light  most favorable\n\nto the  verdict, drawing all reasonable  inferences and resolving\n\nall credibility determinations in favor of  the verdict, in order\n\nto  determine  whether a  reasonable  trier  of  fact could  have\n\nreached a verdict  of guilt.   United States  v. Tuesta-Toro,  29\r                                                                      \n\nF.3d  771, 773  (1st Cir.  1994).   The evidence  arrayed against\n\nappellant plainly surmounted this threshold.  \n\n          Although unemployed  at the time of  the arrest, appel-\n\nlant  possessed a substantial amount  of cash clearly linked with\n\nthe  larger cocaine conspiracy.   See United  States v. Figueroa,\r                                                                          \n\n976 F.2d  1446, 1455 (1st  Cir. 1992) (defendant's  possession of\n\nlarge  amount of  cash     otherwise  unexplained     constitutes\n\nrelevant evidence  in prosecution for violating    841(a)), cert.\r                                                                           \n\ndenied,  113 S.  Ct.  1346 (1993).    The jury  reasonably  could\r                \n\nconclude that appellant was engaged in countersurveillance at the\n\nscene of the drug exchange, United States v. Munoz, 36 F.3d 1229,\r                                                            \n\n1235 (1st Cir. 1994), and that he constructively possessed the 25\n\nkilograms  of cocaine seized from the vehicle which he had driven\n\n                                3\r\r\n\naround the  park.  Id.   The jury reasonably could  infer    from\r                                \n\nappellant's prolonged presence at  the scene of the crime  and in\n\nclose  proximity to the  cocaine    that  he was  no innocent by-\n\nstander.   See United States v. Hernandez, 995 F.2d 307, 314 (1st\r                                                   \n\nCir.) (\"criminals rarely welcome innocent persons as witnesses to\n\nserious  crimes\"), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 407 (1993).  Finally,\r                                         \n\nappellant's attempt to flee  the scene evinced a  keen conscious-\n\nness of guilt.  Id. at 314-15 (\"[E]vidence of flight is a partic-\r                             \n\nularly eloquent  reflection of  a guilty mind.\")  (citation omit-\n\nted).\n\nB.   Motion for Mistrial\r          B.   Motion for Mistrial\r                                  \n\n          Appellant asserts error in the district court's  denial\n\nof his  motion for  mistrial.   We review  for manifest abuse  of\n\ndiscretion.    United States  v. Pierro,  32  F.3d 611,  617 (1st\r                                                 \n\nCir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 919 (1994).  \r                             \n\n          A police officer testified  that appellant attempted to\n\nflee  when the police moved  in to arrest  the assembled partici-\n\npants.  Appellant objected on the ground that the witness had not\n\nobserved the attempt to flee, hence was not competent to testify.\n\nThe  government conceded the point  and assured the  court that a\n\ncompetent witness would testify to the same effect.  The district\n\ncourt provisionally denied appellant's  motion for mistrial and a\n\ncompetent  witness later  testified  that he  saw appellant  \"not\n\nreally  walking, almost  running\" from  the scene during  the ar-\n\nrests.  There was no error in denying the motion for mistrial.\n\nC.   The Sentencing Claim\r          C.   The Sentencing Claim\r                                   \n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          As required by 21 U.S.C.   851(a), the government  duly\n\nfiled  a  pretrial  information  alerting  appellant  that,  upon\n\nconviction, it  would seek  the enhanced penalties  prescribed by\n\nlaw  for a person with two or more prior felony drug convictions,\n\nsee  21 U.S.C.   841(b)(1)  (\"such person  shall be  sentenced to\r             \n\nlife  imprisonment\"),  thereby   triggering  the  section  851(b)\n\nrequirement that    \n\n          the  court shall after  conviction but before\n          pronouncement  of  sentence  inquire  of  the\n          person with  respect to whom  the information\n          was filed whether  he affirms or  denies that\n          he has been  previously convicted as  alleged\n          in the information, and shall inform him that\n          any challenge to a prior conviction  which is\n          not made  before sentence is imposed  may not\n          thereafter be raised to attack the sentence.\n\n21 U.S.C.   851(b).   The government  concedes that the  district\n\ncourt failed to  comply with  section 851(b) but  imposed a  life\n\nsentence nonetheless. \n\n          We have yet to consider in  a reported decision whether\n\na failure to comply  with section 851(b) is subject  to \"harmless\n\nerror\" analysis.  It is clear, on the other hand, that failure to\n\nfile  the information  required  by section  851(a) deprives  the\n\ndistrict court  of jurisdiction  to impose an  enhanced sentence.\n\nMoreover,  absent compliance  with  section  851(a)  an  enhanced\n\nsentence  cannot be saved under a \"harmless error\" analysis.  See\r                                                                           \n\nSuveges v. United States, 7 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1993) (upholding\r                                  \n\ncollateral challenge to  enhanced sentence imposed after  govern-\n\nment failed to file   851(a) information). \n\n          All courts  of appeals which have  considered the ques-\n\n                                5\r\r\n\ntion  presently hold  that  failure  to  engage in  the  colloquy\n\nrequired by section 851(b) is  subject to \"harmless error\" analy-\n\nsis.

Olson, 716 F.2d 850, 853-\r                                                       \n\n54 (11th Cir. 1983); United States v.

Weaver, 905 F.2d at 1482;  United States\r                                                                           \n\nv.

We are not persuaded to the  contrary view urged by\n\nappellant. \n\n          A procedural  error will  be found  harmless if  \"it is\n\nhighly probable  that the challenged  action did  not affect  the\n\njudgment.\"  United  States v.

Second,  since all\n\nprior convictions relied upon by the district court occurred more\n\nthan  five  years before  the filing  of  the information  in the\n\npresent case, appellant is  barred from challenging their validi-\n\nty.   21 U.S.C.   851(e) (\"No  person who stands convicted  of an\n\noffense under this part  may challenge the validity of  any prior\n\nconviction alleged  under this  section which occurred  more than\n\nfive years before the date of the information alleging such prior\n\nconviction.\").3   Accordingly,  the  district court's  failure to\n\ncomply with section  851(b) was harmless  error and its  judgment\n\nmust be affirmed. \n\n          Affirmed.  \r                    Affirmed.\r                            \n\n                    \r                              \n\n     3Several courts of appeals  have held that   851(e)  moots  \n851(b) if each prior conviction at issue is more than five  years\nold.

After recognizing one of the men, from having seen him at a \"drug point\" previously, the officer maintained surveillance and saw appellant standing in close proximity to a vehicle from which packages wrapped in brown paper were being removed.  The officer suspected that the packages contained cocaine.  Shortly thereafter appellant was seen getting into a vehicle and circling the park.  After appellant rejoined the group, the police moved in to arrest them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant was arrested while attempting to flee.  More than $1,000 in cash was seized from his person, and an empty paper bag--bearing the notation \"$1,500 for Kike\"--was recovered from one of the seized vehicles.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Over 255 kilograms of cocaine were recovered from the vehicles at the scene--twenty-five kilograms from the vehicle used by appellant--all in similarly wrapped one-kilo packages.  Following a three-day jury trial, appellant was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.  This appeal ensued.II</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction for possessing cocaine with intent to distribute.  We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all credibility determinations in favor of the verdict, in order to determine whether a reasonable trier of fact could have reached a verdict of guilt.  United States v. Tuesta-Toro, 29 F.3d 771, 773 (1st Cir.1994).  The evidence arrayed against appellant plainly surmounted this threshold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although unemployed at the time of the arrest, appellant possessed a substantial amount of cash clearly linked with the larger cocaine conspiracy.  See United States v. Figueroa, 976 F.2d 1446, 1455 (1st Cir.1992) (defendant's possession of large amount of cash--otherwise unexplained--constitutes relevant evidence in prosecution for violating Sec. 841(a)), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1346, 122 L.Ed.2d 728 (1993).  The jury reasonably could conclude that appellant was engaged in countersurveillance at the scene of the drug exchange, United States v. Munoz, 36 F.3d 1229, 1235 (1st Cir.1994), and that he constructively possessed the 25 kilograms of cocaine seized from the vehicle which he had driven around the park.  Id.  The jury reasonably could infer--from appellant's prolonged presence at the scene of the crime and in close proximity to the cocaine--that he was no innocent bystander.  See United States v. Hernandez, 995 F.2d 307, 314 (1st Cir.)  (\"criminals rarely welcome innocent persons as witnesses to serious crimes\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 407, 126 L.Ed.2d 354 (1993).  Finally, appellant's attempt to flee the scene evinced a keen consciousness of guilt.  Id. at 314-15 (\"[E]vidence of flight is a particularly eloquent reflection of a guilty mind.\")  (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Motion for Mistrial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant asserts error in the district court's denial of his motion for mistrial.  We review for manifest abuse of discretion.  United States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 617 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 919, 130 L.Ed.2d 799 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A police officer testified that appellant attempted to flee when the police moved in to arrest the assembled participants.  Appellant objected on the ground that the witness had not observed the attempt to flee, hence was not competent to testify.  The government conceded the point and assured the court that a competent witness would testify to the same effect.  The district court provisionally denied appellant's motion for mistrial and a competent witness later testified that he saw appellant \"not really walking, almost running\" from the scene during the arrests.  There was no error in denying the motion for mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The Sentencing Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As required by 21 U.S.C. Sec. 851(a), the government duly filed a pretrial information alerting appellant that, upon conviction, it would seek the enhanced penalties prescribed by law for a person with two or more prior felony drug convictions, see 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1) (\"such person shall be sentenced to life imprisonment\"), thereby triggering the section 851(b) requirement that--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>the court shall after conviction but before pronouncement of sentence inquire of the person with respect to whom the information was filed whether he affirms or denies that he has been previously convicted as alleged in the information, and shall inform him that any challenge to a prior conviction which is not made before sentence is imposed may not thereafter be raised to attack the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">21 U.S.C. Sec. 851(b).  The government concedes that the district court failed to comply with section 851(b) but imposed a life sentence nonetheless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have yet to consider in a reported decision whether a failure to comply with section 851(b) is subject to \"harmless error\" analysis.  It is clear, on the other hand, that failure to file the information required by section 851(a) deprives the district court of jurisdiction to impose an enhanced sentence.  Moreover, absent compliance with section 851(a) an enhanced sentence cannot be saved under a \"harmless error\" analysis.  See Suveges v. United States, 7 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.1993) (upholding collateral challenge to enhanced sentence imposed after government failed to file Sec. 851(a) information).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All courts of appeals which have considered the question presently hold that failure to engage in the colloquy required by section 851(b) is subject to \"harmless error\" analysis.  See United States v. Flores, 5 F.3d 1070, 1082 (7th Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 884, 127 L.Ed.2d 79 (1994);  United States v. Fragoso, 978 F.2d 896, 902 (5th Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1664, 123 L.Ed.2d 282 (1993);  United States v. Housley, 907 F.2d 920, 921-22 (9th Cir.1990);  United States v. Weaver, 905 F.2d 1466, 1482 (11th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1091, 111 S.Ct. 972, 112 L.Ed.2d 1058 (1991).  Although at one time the Fifth Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit took the position that failure to conduct a section 851(b) colloquy deprived the sentencing court of jurisdiction to impose an enhanced sentence, see United States v. Olson, 716 F.2d 850, 853-54 (11th Cir.1983);  United States v. Cevallos, 574 F.2d 854, 855 (5th Cir.1978), both courts now subject such omissions to harmless error review.  Weaver, 905 F.2d at 1482;  United States v. Nanez, 694 F.2d 405, 413 (5th Cir.1982) (expressly overruling Cevallos and applying \"harmless error\"), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 909, 103 S.Ct. 1884, 76 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983).  We are not persuaded to the contrary view urged by appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A procedural error will be found harmless if \"it is highly probable that the challenged action did not affect the judgment.\"  United States v. Noone, 913 F.2d 20, 36 (1st Cir.1990) (citations omitted), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 906, 111 S.Ct. 1686, 114 L.Ed.2d 81 (1991);  see Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) (harmless error defined as \"any error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights\").  The error of omission under section 851(b) was harmless in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, notwithstanding repeated invitations, appellant neither points to a defect in the prior convictions nor denies that he was the person previously convicted.  Second, since all prior convictions relied upon by the district court occurred more than five years before the filing of the information in the present case, appellant is barred from challenging their validity.  21 U.S.C. Sec. 851(e) (\"No person who stands convicted of an offense under this part may challenge the validity of any prior conviction alleged under this section which occurred more than five years before the date of the information alleging such prior conviction.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Accordingly, the district court's failure to comply with section 851(b) was harmless error and its judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The relevant facts are recited in the light most favorable to the verdict.  United States v. Tuesta-Toro, 29 F.3d 771, 773 (1st Cir.1994)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The government established that \"Kike\" was appellant's nickname</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Several courts of appeals have held that Sec. 851(e) moots Sec. 851(b) if each prior conviction at issue is more than five years old.  See Flores, 5 F.3d at 1082;  Fragoso, 978 F.2d at 902;  Housley, 907 F.2d at 921-22;  Weaver, 905 F.2d at 1482.   Although we agree that Sec. 851(e) precludes collateral challenges to the validity of such time-barred convictions, Sec. 851(b) also affords the defendant an opportunity to demonstrate that he is not the person to whom a prior record of conviction refers.  Section 851(e) appears to impose no time limit on the latter challenge</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
