Defendant Frederick  J. Bonamo appeals\r                                \r\n\nhis  sentence  under  the  Sentencing  Guidelines.    He  was\r\n\nsentenced  to   nine  years  imprisonment   and  three  years\r\n\nsupervised release  following a  valid plea agreement.   This\r\n\nagreement, made under Fed.  R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(C), included\r\n\na specific sentence of 10 years incarceration and three years\r\n\nsupervised release,  and provided  that the  government would\r\n\nmove to dismiss  a pending  indictment.  As  a result of  the\r\n\nagreement,  defendant pled guilty  to an information charging\r\n\nhim with violating 18 U.S.C.   922(d)(3) and 18 U.S.C.   371.\r\n\nBy  so doing,  he avoided  going to  trial on  the indictment\r\n\nwhich would have  exposed him to a  15-year mandatory minimum\r\n\nsentence  under the  Armed Career Criminal  Act, 18  U.S.C.  \r\n\n924(e).   The  government argues  that defendant's  appeal is\r\n\nbarred by 18 U.S.C.   3742(c)(1).\r\n\n          A defendant may appeal a final sentence pursuant to\r\n\n  3742(a).  When a defendant agrees to a negotiated plea that\r\n\ncontains  a specific sentence, however,   3742(c)(1) provides\r\n\nthat  he  or  she \"may  not  file  a notice  of  appeal under\r\n\nparagraph  (3) or (4)  of subsection (a)  unless the sentence\r\n\nimposed  is  greater than  the  sentence  set forth  in  such\r\n\nagreement. . . .\"1  Obviously, defendant's sentence is  lower\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Section  3742(a)(3)  permits  a  defendant  to  appeal  a\r\nsentence greater  than the  applicable guideline range  and  \r\n3742(a)(4) permits  the  appeal  of  a  plainly  unreasonable\r\nsentence for an offense for which there is no guideline.\r\r\n\nthan the 10-year sentence  stated in the plea agreement.   We\r\n\ntherefore have  no  jurisdiction to  review  this  sentence.2\r\n\nSee United States  v. Prieto-Duran, 39 F.3d  1119, 1120 (10th\r                                              \r\n\nCir. 1994).\r\n\n          Defendant attempts to avoid  the ban contained in  \r\n\n3742(c) by arguing that his sentence was imposed in violation\r\n\nof the law or  as the result  of an incorrect application  of\r\n\nthe  sentencing  guidelines   --  appeals   permitted  by    \r\n\n3742(a)(1) and (a)(2) respectively.  His claim is premised on\r\n\nthe  fact that  his sentence  represents an  upward departure\r\n\nfrom  the guideline range for  the offenses to  which he pled\r\n\nguilty.   Specifically, he  contends that the  district court\r\n\nerred in basing  the enhanced sentence  on convictions as  to\r\n\nwhich he had  had his  civil rights restored  pursuant to  18\r\n\nU.S.C.   921(a)(20) (a \"conviction . . . for which a person .\r\n\n. . has had civil rights  restored shall not be considered  a\r\n\nconviction\").   We  reject  this argument  for the  following\r\n\nreasons.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The  government could  have filed  an appeal  because the\r\nsentence is  lower than the one  to which it had  agreed.  18\r\nU.S.C.   3742(c)(2).   See, e.g., United States v.  Mukai, 26\r                                                                     \r\nF.3d 953 (9th Cir. 1994)  (government appealed the refusal by\r\nthe  district court  to  allow it  to  withdraw from  a  plea\r\nagreement when  the court imposed a sentence  lower than that\r\ncontained in  the agreement); United States  v. Skidmore, 998\r                                                                    \r\nF.2d 372  (6th Cir.  1993) (government appealed  the district\r\ncourt's  imposition  of  a   sentence  which  did  not  order\r\nforfeiture  as  the  parties  had specified).    Because  the\r\ngovernment  does not pursue  an appeal, however,  we need not\r\naddress the correctness of the sentence in this case.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          First, no matter how defendant  phrases this issue,\r\n\nit still concerns an appeal of a sentence within   3741(a)(3)\r\n\n--  that is, one that is \"greater than the sentence specified\r\n\nin  the  applicable  guideline  range.\"    The  fact  is that\r\n\ndefendant received the benefit of his bargain and avoided the\r\n\npossibility of  a 15-year sentence.   \"This is  precisely the\r\n\ntype  of appeal which is  barred by 18  U.S.C.   3742(c)(1).\"\r\n\nPrieto-Duran, 39 F.3d at 1120 (where a sentence is within the\r                        \r\n\nplea agreement, no appeal  will lie even though the  sentence\r\n\nis an upward departure from the guideline range).\r\n\n          Second, the plea  agreement provided for  an upward\r\n\ndeparture  on the  ground that  defendant's  criminal history\r\n\ncategory under the Guidelines  did not adequately reflect the\r\n\nseriousness of his  past criminal conduct.   The parties thus\r\n\nagreed to an upward departure based on   4A1.3:\r\n\n          If  reliable  information indicates  that\r\n          the  criminal  history category  does not\r\n          adequately reflect the seriousness of the\r\n          defendant's past criminal conduct  or the\r\n          likelihood that the defendant will commit\r\n          other  crimes,  the  court  may  consider\r\n          imposing  a  sentence departing  from the\r\n          otherwise applicable guideline range.\r\n\nSuch  information includes  \"prior  sentence(s) not  used  in\r\n\ncomputing the criminal history category.\"    4A1.3(a).\r\n\n          Defendant's argument is  premised on the definition\r\n\nof  a conviction contained in   921(a)(20) and referred to in\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    2K2.1  (calculating  the base  offense level  for\r\n\nfirearms violations).  The problem with this position is that\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n  4A1.3 is  not limited  to \"past convictions.\"   Rather,  it\r\n\nrefers  to \"past criminal  conduct.\"   Certainly, defendant's\r                                              \r\n\npast convictions are evidence of criminal conduct.  Moreover,\r\n\nthere  is  nothing  in  the  Guidelines  or  elsewhere  which\r\n\nindicates  that the  kind  of criminal  conduct  a court  may\r\n\nconsider under    4A1.3 is  restricted in  the way  defendant\r\n\nsuggests.   Thus,  the  district court  did  not err  in  the\r\n\ncalculation of the upward departure defendant received.\r\n\n          Defendant's other claim is that the  district court\r\n\nfailed to  state with sufficient specificity  the grounds for\r\n\nthe upward departure  as required by 18 U.S.C.    3553(c)(2).\r\n\nWe  disagree.    First,  the  plea  agreement  obligated  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  to  enhance  defendant's  sentence  and  the\r\n\nagreement specified  the reason  for the upward  departure --\r\n\ndefendant's  criminal  history  category did  not  adequately\r\n\nreflect  the seriousness of his  past criminal conduct or the\r\n\nlikelihood that  he  would continue  to commit  crimes.   The\r\n\ndistrict  court  not only  iterated  this  at the  sentencing\r\n\nhearing, but also observed that defendant often ended up back\r\n\nin  prison after being released, that the absence of criminal\r\n\nactivity usually  was because defendant was  incarcerated and\r\n\nthat  there  were other  criminal  charges  currently pending\r\n\nagainst  defendant.   We  believe that  this  is a  \"reasoned\r\n\njustification\" for  its decision and plainly  is adequate for\r\n\nappellate  review.  See United States v. Emery, 991 F.2d 907,\r                                                          \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n913 (1st Cir. 1993)  (the district court need not  explain in\r\n\n\"mathematical or pseudo-mathematical  terms each  microscopic\r\n\nchoice made in arriving at  the precise sentence\").  Further,\r\n\nit is obvious from the record as a whole in this case why the\r\n\ncourt  ordered an  upward departure.   See  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nQuinones, 26 F.3d 213, 219 (1st Cir.  1994) (we will uphold a\r                    \r\n\ndeparture  decision  where  \"an  explanation  can  fairly  be\r\n\nimplied from the record as a whole\").\r\n\n          The judgment  of  the district  court is  summarily\r                                                                         \r\n\naffirmed.  See Local Rule 27.1.\r                          \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n",

The parties thus\r\n\nagreed to an upward departure based on   4A1.3:\r\n\n          If  reliable  information indicates  that\r\n          the  criminal  history category  does not\r\n          adequately reflect the seriousness of the\r\n          defendant's past criminal conduct  or the\r\n          likelihood that the defendant will commit\r\n          other  crimes,  the  court  may  consider\r\n          imposing  a  sentence departing  from the\r\n          otherwise applicable guideline range.\r\n\nSuch  information includes  \"prior  sentence(s) not  used  in\r\n\ncomputing the criminal history category.\"    4A1.3(a).\r\n\n          Defendant's argument is  premised on the definition\r\n\nof  a conviction contained in   921(a)(20) and referred to in\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    2K2.1  (calculating  the base  offense level  for\r\n\nfirearms violations).  The problem with this position is that\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n  4A1.3 is  not limited  to \"past convictions.\"   Rather,  it\r\n\nrefers  to \"past criminal  conduct.\"   Certainly, defendant's\r                                              \r\n\npast convictions are evidence of criminal conduct.  Moreover,\r\n\nthere  is  nothing  in  the  Guidelines  or  elsewhere  which\r\n\nindicates  that the  kind  of criminal  conduct  a court  may\r\n\nconsider under    4A1.3 is  restricted in  the way  defendant\r\n\nsuggests.   Thus,  the  district court  did  not err  in  the\r\n\ncalculation of the upward departure defendant received.\r\n\n          Defendant's other claim is that the  district court\r\n\nfailed to  state with sufficient specificity  the grounds for\r\n\nthe upward departure  as required by 18 U.S.C.    3553(c)(2).\r\n\nWe  disagree.    First,  the  plea  agreement  obligated  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  to  enhance  defendant's  sentence  and  the\r\n\nagreement specified  the reason  for the upward  departure --\r\n\ndefendant's  criminal  history  category did  not  adequately\r\n\nreflect  the seriousness of his  past criminal conduct or the\r\n\nlikelihood that  he  would continue  to commit  crimes.   The\r\n\ndistrict  court  not only  iterated  this  at the  sentencing\r\n\nhearing, but also observed that defendant often ended up back\r\n\nin  prison after being released, that the absence of criminal\r\n\nactivity usually  was because defendant was  incarcerated and\r\n\nthat  there  were other  criminal  charges  currently pending\r\n\nagainst  defendant.   We  believe that  this  is a  \"reasoned\r\n\njustification\" for  its decision and plainly  is adequate for\r\n\nappellate  review.  See United States v.
