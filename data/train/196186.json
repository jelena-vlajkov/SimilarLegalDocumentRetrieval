Following a lengthy criminal\r                      STAHL, Circuit Judge.\r                                          \r\n\ntrial, a jury convicted  defendant Alfred Trenkler of various\r\n\ncharges  stemming  from  a  bomb  explosion  in   Roslindale,\r\n\nMassachusetts (\"the Roslindale  bomb\").  On  appeal, Trenkler\r\n\nchallenges  the  admission  of   evidence  relating  to   his\r\n\nparticipation  in a  prior bombing  that occurred  five years\r\n\nearlier  in  Quincy,   Massachusetts  (\"the  Quincy   bomb\").\r\n\nTrenkler  also  assigns  error  to  two  evidentiary  rulings\r\n\nadmitting evidence  derived  from a  computer  database  that\r\n\npurported to  establish that  Trenkler built both  the Quincy\r\n\nand  the Roslindale bombs and several out-of-court statements\r\n\nmade by a fellow  participant in the bombing.   After careful\r\n\nreview, we affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Background\r                                      Background\r                                                \r\n\n          On  October  28,  1991,  a  bomb  exploded  at  the\r\n\nRoslindale home of Thomas L.  Shay (\"Shay Sr.\"), killing  one\r\n\nBoston police officer and severely injuring another.  The two\r\n\nofficers, members of the Boston Police Department Bomb Squad,\r\n\nhad been  dispatched  to Shay  Sr.'s  home to  investigate  a\r\n\nsuspicious object located  in Shay Sr.'s driveway.   Shay Sr.\r\n\nhad  earlier  reported that,  while  backing  his 1986  Buick\r\n\nCentury  into the street the day  before, he had heard a loud\r\n\nnoise   emanating  from   beneath   the  floorboard   of  his\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nautomobile.  Shay Sr. added that,  subsequently, he found the\r\n\nsuspicious object resting near the crest of his driveway.\r\n\n          Following  the  explosion, a  massive investigation\r\n\nensued involving  a variety of federal, state  and local law-\r\n\nenforcement agencies.   On June 24,  1993, this investigation\r\n\nculminated  with  the  return  of  a  three-count  indictment\r\n\ncharging Trenkler and Thomas A. Shay (\"Shay Jr.\"), Shay Sr.'s\r\n\nson,   with  responsibility  for   the  Roslindale  bombing.1\r\n\nTrenkler  filed  a  successful  severance  motion,   and  the\r\n\ngovernment tried the two defendants separately.  Shay Jr. was\r\n\ntried first, and a jury convicted him on counts of conspiracy\r\n\nand   malicious   destruction   of  property   by   means  of\r\n\nexplosives.2\r\n\n          At Trenkler's trial, the thrust of the government's\r\n\ncase was that Trenkler had built the Roslindale bomb for Shay\r\n\nJr.  to  use against  his  father.   To  establish Trenkler's\r\n\nidentity as the builder of the bomb,  the government offered,\r\n\ninter alia, evidence that Trenkler had previously constructed\r                      \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  June  24,   1993,  indictment  specifically  charged\r\nTrenkler and  Shay  Jr. with  conspiracy,  18 U.S.C.     371;\r\nreceipt of explosive materials with knowledge and intent that\r\nthey  would be used to kill, injure and intimidate, and cause\r\ndamage to real and personal property, 18 U.S.C.   844(d); and\r\nmalicious destruction of property  by means of explosives; 18\r\nU.S.C.    844(i).    The indictment  superseded a  five-count\r\nindictment initially returned against  Trenkler and Shay  Jr.\r\non December 16, 1992.\r\n\n2.  The  district  court  sentenced  Shay  Jr.  to concurrent\r\nsentences of 188 and 60 months.  \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\na remote-control  device, the Quincy bomb,  which exploded in\r\n\nQuincy, Massachusetts,  in  1986.   The government  contended\r\n\nthat unique similarities in design, choice of components, and\r\n\noverall modus  operandi between  the two bombs  compelled the\r                                   \r\n\nconclusion that Trenkler had designed and built both devices.\r\n\nPrior  to trial,  the  government filed  a  motion in  limine\r                                                                         \r\n\nseeking to admit the \"similarity\" evidence.  Following a day-\r\n\nlong  evidentiary  hearing,  the  district  court  ruled  the\r\n\nevidence  admissible, finding  that  it was  relevant on  the\r\n\nissues of  identity, skill, knowledge, and  intent.  Although\r\n\nTrenkler  did not testify at trial, his counsel stipulated at\r\n\nthe evidentiary  hearing that  Trenkler had built  the Quincy\r\n\nbomb.3  \r\n\n1986 Quincy Bomb\r            1986 Quincy Bomb\r                            \r\n\n          Trenkler constructed the Quincy  bomb in 1986 for a\r\n\nfriend,  Donna Shea.   At  the time,  Shea was involved  in a\r\n\ndispute  with the owners of  the Capeway Fish  Market and she\r\n\nwanted the bomb to use as a means to intimidate them.  At her\r\n\nrequest, Trenkler assembled a remote-control, radio-activated\r\n\nexplosive device.    The device  was  later attached  to  the\r\n\nundercarriage of a truck belonging to the Capeway Fish Market\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  During  the  original  1986 investigation  of  the Quincy\r\nbombing, Trenkler admitted building  the bomb.  In  1987, the\r\nCommonwealth   of   Massachusetts  brought   charges  against\r\nTrenkler for his  involvement in the Quincy bombing,  but the\r\ncharges were dismissed.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nand detonated in the middle of the night.  The resulting bomb\r\n\nblast caused no injuries and little property damage.\r\n\n          In building  the Quincy bomb, Trenkler  used as the\r\n\nexplosive  material  a  military  flash  simulator  typically\r\n\nutilized to  mimic gunfire in  combat exercises.   To provide\r\n\nremote-control  capabilities,  Trenkler  employed   a  radio-\r\n\nreceiver  he  had removed  from a  small  toy car.   Trenkler\r\n\nwrapped the bomb  in duct  tape and attached  a large  donut-\r\n\nshaped speaker magnet  to enable  the bomb to  adhere to  the\r\n\nundercarriage of  the truck.  Other  components Trenkler used\r\n\nincluded a  \"double throw\" toggle switch,  four AA batteries,\r\n\ntwo six-volt  batteries, an  electric relay, solder,  various\r\n\nwires, and a slide switch.\r\n\n          Testimony  at  trial   established  that   Trenkler\r\n\npurchased some  of the  electrical components for  the Quincy\r\n\nbomb from a  Radio Shack  store.  On  one occasion,  Trenkler\r\n\nsought to obtain needed  components by sending Shea's eleven-\r\n\nyear-old nephew into a Radio Shack store with a list of items\r\n\nto purchase while Trenkler  remained waiting outside.  Shea's\r\n\nnephew, however, was  unable to  find all of  the items,  and\r\n\nTrenkler eventually came into the store to assist him.  \r\n\n1991 Roslindale Bomb\r            1991 Roslindale Bomb\r                                \r\n\n          The  government contended  that Trenkler  built the\r\n\nRoslindale  bomb  at  Shay  Jr.'s  request.    At trial,  the\r\n\ngovernment  offered  evidence  about Trenkler's  relationship\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nwith Shay  Jr., dating back  at least two years  prior to the\r\n\nRoslindale bombing.  Several witnesses,  including Trenkler's\r\n\nbusiness  partner,  reported  seeing  the  two  together   on\r\n\ndifferent  occasions in  1990 and 1991.   Shay  Jr.'s address\r\n\nbook included an entry for Trenkler listing his current pager\r\n\nnumber.   Moreover, Trenkler's roommate  at the  time of  the\r\n\nRoslindale  bombing  testified  that,  during  September  and\r\n\nOctober of 1991, Shay Jr. left several voice-mail messages on\r\n\nthe pager for Trenkler.    \r\n\n          Testimony  from  government investigators  and Shay\r\n\nSr.  established  that  the  Roslindale bomb  was  a  remote-\r\n\ncontrol,  radio-activated  device  with  an  explosive  force\r\n\nsupplied  by two or three sticks of dynamite connected to two\r\n\nelectrical blasting caps.  A black wooden box weighing two or\r\n\nthree pounds and measuring approximately eight- to ten-inches\r\n\nlong, five- to  six-inches wide and  one- to two-inches  deep\r\n\nhoused  the bomb.   A large  donut-shaped magnet  and several\r\n\nsmaller round magnets attached to the box were used to secure\r\n\nthe  device to the underside of Shay Sr.'s automobile.  Other\r\n\ncomponents used in the construction of the bomb included duct\r\n\ntape, a \"single throw\" toggle switch, four AA batteries, five\r\n\nnine-volt batteries, a Futaba radio receiver, solder, various\r\n\nwires, and a slide switch.  \r\n\n          According to the government's experts and Shay Sr.,\r\n\nthe bomb was originally attached to the undercarriage of Shay\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nSr.'s  automobile directly  beneath the  driver's seat.   The\r\n\ngovernment's explosives expert testified that if the bomb had\r\n\nexploded while still  attached to the car,  it probably would\r\n\nhave  killed or  at  least seriously  injured any  individual\r\n\nsitting in the driver's seat.\r\n\n          The  government also  asserted  that Trenkler  used\r\n\nShay Jr. to  purchase the electronic  components used in  the\r\n\nbomb.     In  support  of  this   assertion,  the  government\r\n\nintroduced a sales receipt  for a toggle switch purchased  in\r\n\nOctober 1991 at a Radio Shack store located across the street\r\n\nfrom  where Trenkler, at the time, was installing a satellite\r\n\ndish.4    Agents from  the  Bureau  of Alcohol,  Tobacco  and\r\n\nFirearms (\"ATF\") recovered from  the debris of the Roslindale\r\n\nbomb  a  switch identical  to the  one  purchased.   Shay Jr.\r\n\nadmitted  purchasing  the switch  during  a  taped television\r\n\ninterview, portions  of  which the  government introduced  at\r\n\ntrial.5    Furthermore,  a  sales clerk  at  the  Radio Shack\r\n\ntestified that,  prior to  purchasing the switch,  the person\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Trenkler has an extensive  background in electronics.  At\r\nthe time of the Roslindale bomb, he operated his own business\r\ninstalling satellite dishes and other electronic equipment.\r\n\n5.  The Radio Shack sales receipt has the  letters \"sahy jyt\"\r\nprinted in a space  for the customer's address and  lists the\r\ncustomer's  \"ID\"   number  (the  last  four   digits  of  the\r\ncustomer's phone number) as \"3780.\"  The government maintains\r\nthat this corroborates Shay Jr.'s statement that he purchased\r\ncomponents for the bomb because \"sahy\" is a  transposition of\r\n\"Shay\" and \"3780\" is a transposition of \"7380,\" the last four\r\ndigits of Shay Sr.'s phone number. \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nwho bought it had  browsed in the store for  several minutes,\r\n\nappearing  to shop  for items written  on a list.   The sales\r\n\nclerk also testified that he  recalled seeing Trenkler in the\r\n\nstore on two or three occasions during the fall of 1991.\r\n\n          Both the government and Trenkler elicited testimony\r\n\nfrom  their  respective  explosives  experts  explaining  the\r\n\nsimilarities  and differences  between the  two bombs.   Both\r\n\nexperts   testified  at  length   concerning  the  electronic\r\n\ndesigns,  the   choice  of  components  and   the  method  of\r\n\nconstruction.   The government's  expert opined that  the two\r\n\nincidents shared  many  similar traits  and  characteristics,\r\n\nevincing  the \"signature\" of a single bomb maker.  He further\r\n\nstated that he had no doubt \"whatsoever\" that the same person\r\n\nbuilt  both bombs.   Trenkler's  expert, on  the other  hand,\r\n\nstated that too many dissimilarities existed to conclude that\r\n\nthe  same  person built  both  bombs.   Moreover,  Trenkler's\r\n\nexpert testified  that the similarities  that existed  lacked\r\n\nsufficient distinguishing qualities to identify the two bombs\r\n\nas the handiwork of a specific individual.\r\n\nEXIS Computer Database Evidence\r            EXIS Computer Database Evidence\r                                           \r\n\n          To support  the inference that Trenkler  built both\r\n\nbombs, the government offered  testimony both at the pretrial\r\n\nhearing and at trial concerning information retrieved from an\r\n\nATF  computer database  of  explosives and  arson  incidents.\r\n\nStephen Scheid, an Intelligence Research Specialist with ATF,\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\ntestified  that  the   database,  known  as  EXIS,   contains\r\n\ninformation taken  from reports  submitted to ATF  by various\r\n\nfederal, state  and local law-enforcement  agencies.   Scheid\r\n\nfurther testified that he had been personally responsible for\r\n\nmaintaining the database  since 1977.  Scheid  stated that he\r\n\nreviews  submitted   incident  reports,  culling   from  them\r\n\ninformation describing the characteristics of each bombing or\r\n\narson  episode.    Scheid  added  that  he then  encodes  the\r\n\nextracted  information on a  standardized worksheet, which he\r\n\nor  a data-entry person in turn uses to enter the information\r\n\ninto the database.\r\n\n          Scheid  testified   that,  through  the  use  of  a\r\n\ncomputer  program, he  then produces  investigatory leads  by\r\n\nretrieving  all incidents  entered in  the database  that are\r\n\nlisted as possessing a specific  component or characteristic.\r\n\nScheid  further testified that, in  an effort to identify the\r\n\nbuilder of  the  Roslindale bomb,  he performed  a series  of\r\n\ncomputer   queries,  focusing   on  characteristics   of  the\r\n\nRoslindale bomb.  This series of inquiries narrowed the field\r\n\nof  reported incidents in the database from 40,867 to seven.6\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  The computer  queries and  the total number  of resulting\r\nincidents are listed below.

Lindholm  testified  that he  met  Trenkler  at  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          Under vehicles                  -    428\r\n\n          Remote-control                  -     19\r\n\n          Using magnets                   -      7\r\n\n7.  Scheid testified that, of  the seven remaining incidents,\r\nonly  the Roslindale  and the  Quincy bomb  were reported  as\r\npossessing  all  of  the  additional features:    duct  tape,\r\nsoldering,  AA   batteries,  toggle  switches,   and  \"round\"\r\nmagnets.\r\n\n8.  Scheid testified that, in entering information about  the\r\nQuincy  bombing into the EXIS database, he relied solely on a\r\nlaboratory report prepared in  1986 by investigators from the\r\nMassachusetts  Department  of Public  Safety.    This report,\r\nhowever,  does not state that the Quincy bomb was attached to\r\nthe  underside of the  Capeway truck.  It  only refers to the\r\nbomb as an \"[e]xplosion on truck.\"  Nevertheless, Scheid used\r\n\"under vehicle\" as  one of the computer queries  that matched\r\nthe Quincy and Roslindale bombings.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nPlymouth House of Correction  where they had spent  four days\r\n\nincarcerated together in an uncomfortable orientation holding\r\n\ncell in December 1992.  Lindholm testified that initially the\r\n\ncell had held about forty-four prisoners, but that eventually\r\n\nthe total number  of prisoners in the cell dwindled to six or\r\n\nseven.   Lindholm  added that  he had  numerous conversations\r\n\nwith  Trenkler over  the  course of  the  four days  as  they\r\n\ngradually \"bonded\"  upon discovering that they  came from the\r\n\nsame home town and had similar backgrounds.  \r\n\n          Lindholm  testified that  he  gave  Trenkler  legal\r\n\nadvice based on  his own experience as a  criminal defendant.\r\n\nLindholm  acknowledged that  Trenkler initially  asserted his\r\n\ninnocence and had maintained that he could not understand why\r\n\nShay  Jr. had implicated him in the case.  Lindholm testified\r\n\nfurther that Trenkler later told him that the government knew\r\n\nthat some of the  components used in the Roslindale  bomb had\r\n\nbeen purchased locally and that, in response, Lindholm opined\r\n\nthat  the bomber had  been careless not  to have gone  out of\r\n\nstate.  To  this, Trenkler  agreed and then  stated that  the\r\n\nlocal purchase was \"regrettable.\"\r\n\n          In addition,  Lindholm recalled  that at  one point\r\n\nduring the four  days they  discussed Trenkler's  involvement\r\n\nwith the 1986  Quincy bomb.  Lindholm  testified that, during\r\n\nthis discussion,  Trenkler asserted that  the Roslindale bomb\r\n\nwas much  more powerful than the  bomb he had built  in 1986.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nUltimately, Lindholm stated  that Trenkler admitted  building\r\n\nthe Roslindale bomb, testifying that:\r\n\n          [Lindholm:]    At  one point  he  stated,\r\n          [\"W]ell, even  if I  did build a  bomb, I\r\n          did not place it on the car.[\"]\r\n\n          [Government:]  What happened next?\r\n\n          [Lindholm:]  Then he  paused for a moment\r\n          and  said, [\"S]o,  I built  the bomb.   I\r\n          built the  bomb.  I don't  deserve to die\r\n          or spend  the rest  of my life  in prison\r\n          for building this device.[\"]\r\n\nLindholm  added further  that Trenkler  \"stated that  the two\r\n\nbomb  squad  officers  were  foolish and  negligent  for  not\r\n\nwearing  body armor at the time that they were examining this\r\n\ndevice, and in  essence that  it served them  right for  what\r\n\nhappened to them.  It wasn't his fault.\"  \r\n\n          At  the   time  of  trial,  Lindholm   was  serving\r\n\nsentences stemming  from convictions on federal  drug and tax\r\n\nevasion charges.  Lindholm testified that he had not received\r\n\nnor  discussed  receiving  anything  from  the  government in\r\n\nreturn for  his testimony.  On  cross examination, Trenkler's\r\n\ncounsel  made  only a  minimal  effort  to impeach  Lindholm,\r\n\nraising  matters  unrelated  to  his   testimony  implicating\r\n\nTrenkler.     Primarily   Trenkler's  counsel   attempted  to\r\n\nchallenge Lindholm's  assertion that, as a small  boy, he had\r\n\nat one  time lived on the same street as Trenkler and to show\r\n\nthat  Lindholm was  at  the Plymouth  House of  Correction in\r\n\nDecember  1992  in  order   to  provide  information  to  the\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\ngovernment  on  other  individuals  with  whom  he  had  been\r\n\ninvolved in past criminal activities.\r\n\n          In  addition to  Lindholm's  testimony, ATF  Agents\r\n\nDennis Leahy  and Thomas  D'Ambrosio recounted a  November 6,\r\n\n1991, interview  they conducted  with Trenkler shortly  after\r\n\nthe  bombing.    During  this  interview,  Trenkler  admitted\r\n\nbuilding  the  Quincy bomb  and  sketched  a circuit  diagram\r\n\ndescribing  it.   After making  the sketch,  Agent D'Ambrosio\r\n\nasked Trenkler how the  diagram would differ if Trenkler  had\r\n\nused dynamite like that  utilized in the Roslindale incident.\r\n\nBoth  agents testified  that, in  response to  this question,\r\n\nTrenkler drew a second diagram,  which featured two sticks of\r\n\ndynamite  connected to  two electrical  blasting caps.   Both\r\n\nagents  added that  they  were surprised  when  they saw  the\r\n\ndiagram because the use of two electrical blasting caps was a\r\n\ndistinctive feature of  the Roslindale bomb that, at the time\r\n\nof the interview, had not been disclosed  to the public.9  At\r\n\ntrial,  Leahy also  related other  conversations he  had with\r\n\nTrenkler in  which Trenkler  conveyed a working  knowledge of\r\n\ndynamite and electrical blasting caps.\r\n\n          Leahy further testified  about a statement Trenkler\r\n\nmade to  him at the ATF  offices on February 4,  1992.  Leahy\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  Although the  agents  conducted the  interview  during  a\r\nsearch of Trenkler's place of business (to which Trenkler had\r\nconsented), neither agent attempted  to keep the drawing and,\r\nconsequently, it was not produced at trial.     \r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nexplained  that Trenkler had come  to the offices  on his own\r\n\naccord to pick up  previously-seized business records.  Leahy\r\n\nstated that,  during his visit,  Trenkler engaged Leahy  in a\r\n\nlong  discussion,  lasting more  than  two  hours, about  the\r\n\ncourse of the investigation.  According to Leahy's testimony,\r\n\nafter  Leahy had  ended  the  discussion, Trenkler  announced\r\n\narrogantly upon leaving the  ATF offices that \"If we  did it,\r\n\nthen only we know about it.  How will you ever find out . . .\r\n\nif neither one of us talk[]?\"        \r\n\n          The jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts of\r\n\nthe indictment.   Subsequently, the district  court sentenced\r\n\nTrenkler  to concurrent  terms  of life  imprisonment on  the\r\n\ncounts  of  receipt  of  explosive  materials  and  attempted\r\n\nmalicious destruction of property  by means of explosives and\r\n\nsixty months  on  the  count  of conspiracy.    Trenkler  now\r\n\nappeals.    \r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          On appeal,  Trenkler assigns error to the admission\r\n\nof the  Quincy bomb  evidence, contending primarily  that the\r\n\nincident was not sufficiently  similar to the Roslindale bomb\r\n\nto be relevant on the issue of identity, and to the admission\r\n\nof the  EXIS  database-derived evidence  that the  government\r\n\nused  to prove  the similarity  of the  two bombs.   Trenkler\r\n\nadditionally  argues  that  the  district  court  erroneously\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nadmitted several out-of-court statements made by Shay Jr.  We\r\n\ndiscuss each argument in turn.10\r\n\nA.  Quincy Bombing Evidence\r                                       \r\n\n          We   begin  with  Trenkler's  contention  that  the\r\n\ndistrict court erred in admitting  the evidence of the Quincy\r\n\nbombing.\r\n\n          1.  Fed. R. Evid. 404(b):  Other Act Evidence\r                                                                   \r\n\n          In  general,  Rule 404(b)11  proscribes the  use of\r\n\nother bad-act evidence solely to establish that the defendant\r\n\nhas a  propensity towards  criminal behavior.   Rule 404(b)'s\r\n\nproscription, however, is not absolute:  the rule permits the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.  Trenkler   also  raises   the  issue   of  prosecutorial\r\nmisconduct.     Trenkler  contends   that  counsel  for   the\r\ngovernment  intentionally  made inflammatory  remarks  in the\r\ngovernment's  opening  statement  and  introduced  prohibited\r\nother-act  evidence  in   contravention  of   representations\r\npreviously made to  the district court.  We find  no merit in\r\nthese contentions.   \r\n\n11.  Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) provides:\r\n\n          (b)  Other   Crimes,  Wrongs,   or  Acts.\r\n          Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts\r\n          is not admissible  to prove the character\r\n          of a  person in  order to show  action in\r\n          conformity therewith.   It may,  however,\r\n          be admissible for other purposes, such as\r\n          proof  of  motive,  opportunity,  intent,\r\n          preparation,  plan,  knowledge, identity,\r\n          or  absence  of   mistake  or   accident,\r\n          provided   that   upon  request   by  the\r\n          accused,  the  prosecution in  a criminal\r\n          case shall provide  reasonable notice  in\r\n          advance of  trial, or during trial if the\r\n          court  excuses  pretrial  notice on  good\r\n          cause shown, of the general nature of any\r\n          such evidence it intends to  introduce at\r\n          trial.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nuse of such evidence if it bears on a material  issue such as\r\n\nmotive,  knowledge or  identity.   In  this Circuit,  we have\r\n\nadopted a two-part test  for determining the admissibility of\r\n\nRule 404(b)  evidence.  E.g., United States  v. Williams, 985\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 634, 637  (1st Cir.  1993).  First,  the district  court\r\n\nmust  determine  whether  the   evidence  has  some  \"special\r\n\nrelevance\"  independent  of  its   tendency  simply  to  show\r\n\ncriminal propensity.  E.g., United  States v. Guyon, 27  F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n723,  728 (1st  Cir.  1994).   Second,  if the  evidence  has\r\n\n\"special relevance\" on a material issue,  the court must then\r\n\ncarefully conduct a  Rule 40312 analysis to determine  if the\r\n\nprobative  value  of  the   evidence  is  not   substantially\r\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  Williams,  985\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d  at 637.  As with most evidentiary rulings, the district\r\n\ncourt has considerable leeway in determining whether to admit\r\n\nor exclude Rule  404(b) evidence.  Accordingly, we review its\r\n\ndecision  only under the lens  of abuse of  discretion.  Id.;\r                                                                        \r\n\nsee  also United  States v.  Fields, 871  F.2d 188,  196 (1st\r                                               \r\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 955 (1989).   \r                               \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.  Fed. R. Evid. 403 provides:\r\n\n          Although   relevant,   evidence  may   be\r\n          excluded  if  its   probative  value   is\r\n          substantially outweighed by the danger of\r\n          unfair   prejudice,   confusion  of   the\r\n          issues,  or  misleading the  jury,  or by\r\n          considerations of undue  delay, waste  of\r\n          time,   or   needless   presentation   of\r\n          cumulative evidence.\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n          2.  Identity\r                                  \r\n\n          The  government offered the  evidence of the Quincy\r\n\nbomb, which  Trenkler admitted building,  primarily to  prove\r\n\nthat Trenkler also built the Roslindale bomb.  The government\r\n\ncontends that  the evidence of  the Quincy bomb  has \"special\r\n\nrelevance\"  on the  issue  of identity  because the  numerous\r\n\nsimilarities  surrounding the Quincy and Roslindale incidents\r\n\ncompel  the conclusion  that the  same individual  built both\r\n\nbombs.  Trenkler, on  the other hand, argues that  the Quincy\r\n\nincident is too  dissimilar to  be relevant on  the issue  of\r\n\nidentity,  and even  if it  has some  relevance, the  risk of\r\n\nunfair prejudice  that it  poses far outweighs  its probative\r\n\nvalue.  We  agree with  the government that  the Quincy  bomb\r\n\nevidence has \"special relevance\" on the issue of identity and\r\n\nthat  the  district  court  did not  abuse  its  considerable\r\n\ndiscretion in admitting it.\r\n\n               a.

See United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nIngraham, 832 F.2d 229, 231-33 (1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n1009 (1988).

Rule\r                                        \r\n\n104(b) provides, \"When the relevancy of evidence depends upon\r\n\nthe fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court shall admit\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nit  upon,  or  subject   to,  the  introduction  of  evidence\r\n\nsufficient to  support a  finding of the  fulfillment of  the\r\n\ncondition.\"  Fed.

Moreover,\r\n\n          [i]n  determining whether  the Government\r\n          has  introduced  sufficient  evidence  to\r\n          meet Rule 104(b), the trial court neither\r\n          weighs  credibility  nor makes  a finding\r\n          that  the  Government   has  proved   the\r\n          conditional  fact  by a  preponderance of\r\n          the  evidence.  The court simply examines\r\n          all  the evidence in the case and decides\r\n          whether  the  jury could  reasonably find\r\n          the  conditional   fact  .   .  .  by   a\r\n          preponderance of the evidence.\r\n\nHuddleston, 485  U.S. at 690.   Thus, as  here, when a  party\r                      \r\n\nseeks to  admit Rule  404(b) evidence to  establish identity,\r\n\nthe district court must condition  its admission on a showing\r\n\nthat the  shared characteristics  of  the other  act and  the\r\n\ncharged   offense  are  sufficiently   idiosyncratic  that  a\r\n\nreasonable jury could find  it more likely than not  that the\r\n\nsame person performed them both.13  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.  Huddleston involved  the use of Rule  404(b) evidence to\r                           \r\nprove knowledge in a case where the petitioner, charged  with\r\nthe knowing possession of stolen video tapes, claimed that he\r\ndid  not know the  tapes were stolen.   485 U.S.  at 683.  In\r\norder to prove knowledge, the  government introduced evidence\r\nof  the  petitioner's  previous   involvement  in  sales   of\r\nallegedly stolen television sets.  The Supreme Court rejected\r\nthe   petitioner's  contention  that,  before  admitting  the\r\nevidence,  the   district  court  was  required   to  make  a\r\npreliminary finding  that the government had  proven that the\r\ntelevision sets were in fact stolen.

The  test must focus\r                                 \r\n\non  the  \"totality  of   the  comparison,\"  demanding  not  a\r\n\n\"facsimile or exact replica\"  but rather the \"`conjunction of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nstating,  \"If offered for such a proper purpose, the evidence\r\nis subject  only to general strictures limiting admissibility\r\nsuch as Rules 402 and 403.\"  Id. at 688.\r                                            \r\n          The Court  then stated  that evidence of  the prior\r\nsales  was  relevant  for   the  proper  purpose  of  proving\r\nknowledge only  if the jury  could find the  preliminary fact\r\nthat the televisions  were stolen.   Id. at 689.   Thus,  the\r                                                    \r\nCourt held  that Rule 104(b) controlled  the admissibility of\r\nthe evidence.  Id.\r                              \r\n          Though   the  issue  here   arises  in  a  slightly\r\ndifferent  context, we  think  that  Huddleston provides  the\r                                                           \r\nappropriate framework for our analysis.  Here, the government\r\noffered the Quincy bomb evidence  for the proper Rule  404(b)\r\npurpose of identity.  The relevance of the Quincy bomb on the\r\nissue of  identity turns, however, on the factual question of\r\nwhether   the  Roslindale   and  the   Quincy   bombings  are\r\nsufficiently similar to earmark them as  the handiwork of the\r\nsame individual.  This is analogous to whether the television\r\nsets in Huddleston were stolen, and, accordingly, Rule 104(b)\r                              \r\nsets the framework for admissibility. \r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nseveral identifying characteristics  or the presence of  some\r                                                   \r\n\nhighly distinctive quality.'\"  Id. at 232-33 (quoting Pisari,\r                                                                        \r\n\n636  F.2d at 859) (emphasis added); see also United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMyers,  550 F.2d 1036, 1045  (5th Cir. 1977)  (\"[A] number of\r                 \r\n\ncommon  features of lesser  uniqueness, although insufficient\r\n\nto  generate a  strong  inference of  identity if  considered\r\n\nseparately,  may  be  of  significant  probative  value  when\r\n\nconsidered together.\").  In this  case, we think the  balance\r\n\nof  the  evidence  tilts  sufficiently  towards admission  to\r\n\nsatisfy  the   first  step  of  the   Rule  404(b)  analysis.\r\n\nAccordingly, we believe that the district court did not abuse\r\n\nits discretion  in determining that the numerous similarities\r\n\nin components,  design, and  technique of  assembly, combined\r\n\nwith  the  similar  modus   operandi  and  the  closeness  of\r                                                \r\n\ngeographic  proximity between  the  two events,  sufficiently\r\n\nsupport the inference that the same person built both bombs.\r\n\n          We begin by noting that the government's explosives\r\n\nexpert,  Thomas Waskom,  testified that  his analysis  of the\r\n\nsimilarities shared by  the two  incidents left  him with  no\r\n\ndoubt \"whatsoever\" that the same individual built both bombs.\r\n\nOur own review of  the record reveals that the  two bombs did\r\n\nindeed   share   a   number   of   similar   components   and\r\n\ncharacteristics.   Both bombs  were remote-controlled, radio-\r\n\nactivated, electronic explosive devices.  Both were  homemade\r\n\nmechanisms,  comprising,  in  general, electronic  components\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\neasily  purchased at a hobby store.  Both had similar, though\r\n\nnot  identical,  firing  and  fusing  circuits with  separate\r\n\nbattery  power supplies for each.  Both had switches in their\r\n\nfusing  circuits  to  disconnect  the radio  receivers.    To\r\n\nenergize  their  respective  radio  receivers,  both  devices\r\n\nutilized  similar  power  supplies,  consisting  of  four  AA\r\n\nbatteries.   Both  employed many  similar components  such as\r\n\nbatteries,  duct  tape,  toggle  switches,  radio  receivers,\r\n\nantennas,  solder, electrical tape,  and large  round speaker\r\n\nmagnets.   Moreover,  both used  a distinctive  method (i.e.,\r                                                                        \r\n\ntwisting, soldering, and taping)  to connect some, though not\r\n\nall,  of the  wires  used.14   Though we  hardly find  any of\r\n\nthese factors  by themselves to be  \"highly distinctive,\" the\r\n\ncoalescence  of them  is fairly  persuasive.15   Indeed, even\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n14.  Though  it is unclear from a close reading of the record\r\njust  how  many  of the  wires  in  each  bomb employed  this\r\nconnection method,  it is  apparent that  at least  some did.\r\nMore interestingly,  we note that, before  learning that both\r\nbombs had wires that were joined in this fashion,  Trenkler's\r\nexplosives expert  stated that such a method is a \"singularly\r\nunique method[] of assembly  which individual bomb makers are\r\nvery likely to repeat.\"\r\n\n15.  On the other hand,  Trenkler argues that the differences\r\nbetween  the two  bombs are  more significant.   Some  of the\r\ndifferences that Trenkler cites include: \r\n\n         Roslindale Bomb                   Quincy Bomb\r\n\n Two or three sticks of          Military flash simulator used\r\n dynamite rewrapped in a         which produced only minor\r\n magazine page and electrical    damage\r\n blasting caps which killed one\r\n officer and severely injured\r\n another                     -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nTrenkler's  expert  witness, Denny  Kline,  testified  at the\r\n\npretrial hearing that, in light of these similarities, \"there\r\n\nis  a  possibility, a  probability,  that  maybe there  is  a\r                                                                         \r\n\nconnection between the maker of these two bombs.\"   (Emphasis\r                      \r\n\nadded.)\r\n\n          Moreover,  we note  that, in  refusing to  conclude\r\n\n\"beyond  a reasonable  doubt\"16  that the  same person  built\r\n\nboth bombs, Trenkler's expert  Kline eschewed reliance on any\r\n\nfactors except  the physical evidence.   The appropriate test\r\n\nfor sufficient similarity, however, is not so limited.  \"[I]n\r\n\nassessing the sufficiency of  the evidence under Rule 104(b),\r\n\nthe trial court  must consider all evidence  presented to the\r                                              \r\n\njury.\"  Huddleston, 485 U.S. at 690-91 (emphasis added).  \r                              \r\n\n          Accordingly,  we  believe   some  significance   is\r\n\nproperly attributed  to the  simple fact that  both incidents\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n Futaba remote control system    Radio receiver taken from toy\r\n which used a small electrical   car\r\n servo motor                      \r\n \"Single throw\" toggle switch    Relay allowed power to be sent\r\n used to send power to dynamite  to explosives; \"double throw\"\r\n                                 toggle switch used as safety\r\n\n Five nine-volt batteries        Two six-volt batteries\r\n provided power to firing        supplied power to firing\r\n system                          system\r\n\n Device was housed in a black    Device was wrapped in silver\r\n wooden box                      duct tape\r\n\n16.  As the district court correctly noted in its ruling, the\r\ngovernment is not required  to establish \"beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt\"  that  the  same person  built  the  two  bombs.   See\r                                                                         \r\nHuddleston, 485 U.S. at 690.\r                      \r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nare  bombings.  A bombing, in  and of itself, is, arguably, a\r\n\nfairly distinctive  method  for intimidating  or  killing  an\r\n\nindividual.  Cf. United States v.

In addition, both incidents  involved not simply\r\n\nbombs, but remote-control bombs  that were placed  underneath\r\n\nautomotive vehicles.  \r\n\n          In both  instances, the bombs were  constructed and\r\n\nused to benefit a friend of the builder.  Trenkler  built the\r\n\nQuincy bomb for Donna Shea to use to intimidate the owners of\r\n\nthe  Capeway  Fish Market,  and  the  evidence supported  the\r\n\ninference that the person who constructed the Roslindale bomb\r\n\nbuilt  it  for   Shay  Jr.   to  use   against  his   father.\r\n\nFurthermore,  in  both  instances the  builder  attempted  to\r\n\nconceal  his or her participation  by using a  third party to\r\n\npurchase  the  electronic components  used  in  the explosive\r\n\ndevice.   In 1986, Trenkler initially waited in his car while\r\n\nsending Donna Shea's nephew into the electronics store with a\r\n\nlist  to  purchase the  needed  components.   Similarly,  the\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nevidence  supports  the inference  that  the  builder of  the\r\n\nRoslindale  bomb  used  Shay   Jr.  to  purchase  the  needed\r\n\ncomponents.   Finally, the  fact that both  bombings occurred\r\n\nwithin a relatively close  geographic proximity must be given\r\n\nsome weight in the analysis.  \r\n\n          In United States v. Pisari, 636 F.2d 855  (1st Cir.\r                                                \r\n\n1981),  we reversed  the district  court's decision  to admit\r\n\nevidence  of a prior robbery solely on the issue of identity,\r\n\nwhere the  only similarity between it and the charged offense\r\n\nwas  that a knife was  used.  Similarly,  in Garcia-Rosa, 876\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at 224-25,  we refused  to sanction the  admission of  a\r\n\nprior drug  transaction where the only characteristic linking\r\n\nit to  the charged drug deal was  the characteristic exchange\r\n\nof a sample of drugs  prior to the sale.

On the  other  hand, Trenkler  offered  a fairly\r                    \r\n\nimpressive list of differences between the two incidents.  In\r\n\nthe absence of one or more highly distinctive factors that in\r\n\nthemselves   point  to  idiosyncracy,  we  must  examine  the\r\n\ncombination  of all the factors.  Had Trenkler been unable to\r\n\npoint  to any  significant differences,  we suspect  he would\r\n\nhave had little chance in establishing an abuse of discretion\r\n\nin  allowing the  evidence.   Similarly,  had the  government\r\n\nfound but  three or four common  characteristics to establish\r\n\nsufficient  similarity, we  doubt that  the admission  of the\r\n\nevidence  would have been granted or sustained.

We think the answer is yes.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nIngraham,  832 F.2d at  233 (admitting evidence)(\"[G]iven the\r                    \r\n\nhost of  important comparables, the  discrepancies --  though\r\n\nthemselves  not  unimportant--  go   to  the  weight  of  the\r\n\nchallenged evidence, not to its admissibility.\").17\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n17.

We must also\r\n\nreview  the trial  court's determination  that the  probative\r\n\nvalue of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the\r\n\nrisk of unfair prejudice.   Several factors weigh heavily  in\r\n\nthis  balancing,  such  as  the  government's  need  for  the\r\n\nevidence,  see Fields, 871 F.2d at 198 (quoting Fed. R.

Rubio-Estrada, 857 F.2d 845, 851-52 (Torruella, J.,\r                                   \r\n\ndissenting) (explaining inherent unfair prejudice in evidence\r\n\nof prior bad acts).\r\n\n          We believe the district court acted well within its\r\n\nbroad  discretion  in admitting  the  evidence.   First,  the\r\n\nevidence  was  important  to  the  government's  case.    The\r\n\nevidence that Trenkler had built the Quincy bomb corroborated\r\n\nDavid  Lindholm's  testimony,  identifying  Trenkler  as  the\r\n\nbuilder  of  the  Roslindale  bomb.    Second,  although  the\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\nevidence of  similarity could  have been more  compelling, it\r\n\nwas  nonetheless  substantial:    Indeed,   the  government's\r\n\nexplosives expert testified that he had no doubt \"whatsoever\"\r\n\nthat the same person designed and constructed both bombs.  \r\n\n          On the  other hand,  we disagree with  the district\r\n\ncourt  that  the evidence  did not  pose  any risk  of unfair\r\n\nprejudice.18   As  with  all \"bad  act\"  evidence,  there  is\r\n\nalways some danger that the jury will use the evidence not on\r\n\nthe narrow point for which it is offered  but rather to infer\r\n\nthat  the   defendant  has  a   propensity  towards  criminal\r\n\nbehavior.   Nonetheless,  outside the context  of propensity,\r\n\nthe evidence  was not unduly  inflammatory.  The  Quincy bomb\r\n\ndid  not  kill or  injure  any individual  and  caused little\r\n\nproperty damage.  Moreover,  the district court minimized any\r\n\nrisk of  unfair prejudice  by carefully instructing  the jury\r\n\nnot  to use  the  evidence of  the  Quincy bombing  to  infer\r\n\nTrenkler's  guilt  simply  because  he was  a  bad  person or\r\n\nbecause the  fact he had a built  a bomb in the  past made it\r\n\nmore likely he had built  the bomb in this case.   In sum, we\r\n\nbelieve  that the district court did not abuse its discretion\r\n\nin determining  that the probative  value of the  Quincy bomb\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n18.  In ruling  on the  evidence, the district  court stated,\r\ninter alia, \"The  evidence of  the [Quincy]  bomb is  without\r                      \r\nquestion prejudicial  in the sense  that it will  likely harm\r\nthe defendant.  That  is not the test, however,  the question\r\nis whether it is unfairly prejudicial.  It is not.\"\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\nevidence  was not  substantially  outweighed by  the risk  of\r\n\nunfair prejudice.19  \r\n\nB.  EXIS Database Evidence\r                                      \r\n\n          Trenkler  contends that the district court erred in\r\n\nadmitting under the residual hearsay exception, Fed. R. Evid.\r\n\n803(24),20  testimony about the results of  the search of the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n19.  Trenkler also  contends that the  district court  abused\r\nits discretion in admitting the Quincy bomb evidence to prove\r\nknowledge,  skill, and intent.  With respect to the issues of\r\nknowledge  and  skill, we  find  little  merit in  Trenkler's\r\nargument.   Obviously, the fact that Trenkler had in the past\r\nbuilt a remote-control bomb has  some relevance on whether he\r\npossessed  the skill  and  knowledge necessary  to build  the\r\nRoslindale bomb.  See United States v. Latorre, 922 F.2d 1, 8\r                                                          \r\n(1st  Cir.   1990),  cert.  denied,  502   U.S.  876  (1991).\r                                              \r\nFurthermore, because the evidence was otherwise admissible to\r\nshow  identity, allowing  the government  to use  it to  show\r\nskill  and  knowledge, posed  no  additional  risk of  unfair\r\nprejudice.     Trenkler's contention with  respect to  intent\r\nstands   on  firmer   ground.     We  have   some  difficulty\r\ncomprehending   (and   the   government   does   not  clearly\r\narticulate) any theory of \"special relevance\" tending to show\r\nintent that  does  not  depend  heavily on  an  inference  of\r\npropensity.  See  United States  v. Lynn, 856  F.2d 430,  436\r                                                    \r\n(1st  Cir. 1988)  (error to  admit evidence  on  intent where\r\ninference  depends on propensity).   Nonetheless, because the\r\nevidence was  properly admitted  to show  identity, knowledge\r\nand  skill,  any error  in its  admission  to show  intent is\r\nharmless.   See  Benavente Gomez,  921 F.2d at  386 (harmless\r                                            \r\nerror if it is \"highly probable\" the error did not contribute\r\nto the verdict).\r\n\n20.  Fed.

We agree  that the district\r\n\ncourt erred  in admitting  the evidence,  but find  the error\r\n\nharmless.\r\n\n          The government offered  the EXIS-derived  testimony\r\n\nas tending  to  show that  the  Roslindale and  Quincy  bombs\r\n\nevinced the  signature of a single bomb maker.  Specifically,\r\n\nthe government  offered it as an  affirmative assertion that,\r\n\nout  of  more  than  14,000  bombing  and  attempted  bombing\r\n\nincidents,  only the  Roslindale  and  the  Quincy  incidents\r\n\npossessed in common all of the queried characteristics.   The\r\n\ndistrict court admitted the  EXIS-derived testimony under the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          court determines that  (A) the  statement\r\n          is  offered as  evidence  of  a  material\r\n          fact; (B) the statement is more probative\r\n          on the point for which it is offered than\r\n          any  other  evidence which  the proponent\r\n          can  procure through  reasonable efforts;\r\n          and (C)  the  general purposes  of  these\r\n          rules and the  interests of justice  will\r\n          best  be  served   by  admission  of  the\r\n          statement  into  evidence.

Scheid,  the government's expert on EXIS,\r\n\nstated that the database derived from reports submitted by  a\r\n\nvariety of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.\r\n\nThough Scheid testified extensively on the reliability of the\r\n\nprocedures he  followed to cull information  from the reports\r\n\nand  subsequently  input  it  into  the  EXIS  database,  the\r\n\ngovernment   offered   virtually  nothing   establishing  the\r\n\nreliability of the underlying reports.  \r\n\n          On  cross-examination, Scheid, who  had been solely\r\n\nresponsible  for EXIS  since  1977, admitted  that no  agency\r\n\noutside of the ATF was required by law to send reports to the\r\n\nEXIS database  and that  state and local  agencies submitting\r\n\nreports were not required to follow any express procedures or\r\n\nconform to any specific  standards in collecting or recording\r\n\n                             -34-\r                                          34\r\r\n\nthe reported information.

In this  case,  the government  failed  to\r\n\nestablish  that  the  reports  composing  the  EXIS  database\r\n\npossessed  guarantees  of trustworthiness  equivalent  to the\r\n\nother  exceptions  to  the  hearsay  rule.   Neither  are  we\r\n\nconvinced  that the totality of circumstances surrounding the\r\n\nreports   adequately  assure   their  reliability   where  no\r\n\nstandardized procedures were employed in creating the reports\r\n\nand  the sources  of  the reported  information are  unknown.\r\n\nFinally, we find it significant that the government points us\r\n\nto no case  in which it has  successfully (or unsuccessfully)\r\n\nsought to  admit EXIS-derived evidence to  prove the identity\r\n\nof  a bomb  maker.   Accordingly, we  hold that  the district\r\n\n                             -37-\r                                          37\r\r\n\ncourt  abused  its discretion  in admitting  the EXIS-derived\r\n\nevidence  under the residual exception to the hearsay rule to\r\n\nprove the identity of the builder of the Roslindale bomb.21\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n21.  Even putting aside our concerns about the reliability of\r\nthe underlying  reports,  we  remain,  in  general,  somewhat\r\ntroubled  by  the government's  use  of  the evidence.    The\r\nstatement that out of more than  14,000 bombing and attempted\r\nbombing incidents  in the  EXIS database only  the Roslindale\r\nand  Quincy  incidents  share   the  eight  specific  queried\r\ncharacteristics  (bombings  and attempted  bombings, attached\r\nunder car or truck, remote-control, round magnets, duct tape,\r\nsolder, AA  batteries, toggle switches) is  a fairly powerful\r\nstatement, but perhaps a somewhat misleading one.\r\n          First,  the   statement  assumes  as   a  necessary\r\npredicate  that each  of the  more than  14,000 EXIS  entries\r\ndefinitively  states  whether  or not  the  explosive  device\r\ndescribed therein actually  possessed those  characteristics.\r\nWe  have some doubt about the validity of such an assumption.\r\nIn  general,  bomb  reconstruction  strikes us  as  a  rather\r\nresource-intensive operation.   We can envision circumstances\r\n(e.g., a blast  causing little  or no injuries  or damage,  a\r                 \r\nbomb  maker  apprehended before  reconstruction investigation\r\ncomplete) where  the investigation  and the  resulting report\r\nmight not be nearly as thorough or complete as in the case of\r                 \r\neither the Roslindale  or the Quincy  bombs.  Indeed,  during\r\nthe preliminary  hearing both  Scheid and Thomas  Waskom, the\r\ngovernment's explosives expert, acknowledged that the absence\r\nof an item, such  as magnets or batteries, from  a post-blast\r\nreport  meant  only that  investigators  did  not recover  or\r\nidentify the item and not that it was not used.\r\n          Second, without further statistical analysis of the\r\ndatabase, we  believe the  statement that  out  of more  than\r\n14,000 incidents  only the Quincy and  Roslindale bombs share\r\nthe  eight queried characteristics is potentially incomplete.\r\nFor  example, by our count,  the EXIS database  entry for the\r\nRoslindale    incident    lists   approximately    twenty-two\r\ncharacteristics  describing that  incident.   Nowhere in  the\r\nrecord, however, does the government  explain why it chose to\r\nfocus  on  the specific  characteristics  used  to query  the\r\ndatabase.  It does not suggest that these characteristics are\r\nmore important in a  bomb-signature analysis than any of  the\r\nother characteristics not chosen.   Moreover, the  government\r\ndoes not offer any  analysis of the significance of  the fact\r\nthat  the  Roslindale  and  the Quincy  incidents  share  the\r\nqueried characteristics.   In other words, though it  is true\r\nthat  only  the  Quincy  incident shares  the  eight  queried\r\n\n                             -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\n          Although we agree  with Trenkler that the  district\r\n\ncourt  erred  in  admitting  the  EXIS-derived  evidence,  we\r\n\nnonetheless  find  the  error  harmless  beyond  a reasonable\r\n\ndoubt.22    Initially  we  note  that  substantial  evidence,\r\n\nbeyond  Trenkler's  participation  in  the   Quincy  bombing,\r\n\nsupported a  finding that he  had built the  Roslindale bomb.\r\n\nPrincipally, David Lindholm  convincingly testified that,  in\r\n\nfact, Trenkler had actually admitted  building the Roslindale\r\n\nbomb.   Other  admissions  by Trenkler  made  to various  law\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ncharacteristics with the Roslindale  incident, how many other\r\nincidents  share some other set of eight (or more than eight)\r\ncharacteristics with the Roslindale incident?  \r\n          Arguably, these  concerns go more to  the weight of\r\nthe evidence  than to its  admissibility.  However,  we point\r\nthem out  here  to underscore  the caution  a district  court\r\nshould  employ  in  allowing  evidence couched  in  terms  of\r\nnumerical probabilities.   Cf.  United States v.  Massey, 594\r                                                                    \r\nF.2d  676,   679-81  (8th  Cir.   1979)  (testimony   stating\r\nprobability  of  match to  be  one chance  in  4,500 unfairly\r\nconfusing where no foundation for statement provided). \r\n\n22.  In  general, we  review an  evidentiary miscue  only for\r\nharmless error,  dismissing it  if \"we  determine that  it is\r\nhighly probable  that  the error  did not  contribute to  the\r\nverdict.\"    Benavente  Gomez,  921  F.2d  at  386  (internal\r                                         \r\nquotations and  citations omitted).   In this  case, however,\r\nTrenkler also contends that the erroneously admitted evidence\r\ndeprived  him of  his  confrontation rights  under the  Sixth\r\nAmendment,  see  U.S.  Const.  amend  VI  (\"In  all  criminal\r                           \r\nprosecutions, the accused  shall enjoy the right . .  . to be\r\nconfronted  with  the  witnesses against  him.\").    Assuming\r\narguendo  that the  admission  of the  EXIS-derived  evidence\r                    \r\nrises to  the level  of constitutional error,  we accordingly\r\nemploy a  stricter standard,  asking whether we  can consider\r\nthe  error harmless  beyond a  reasonable doubt.

Moreover, Trenkler's\r\n\narrogant assertion to Agent  Leahy that, \"if we did  it, then\r\n\nonly we know about it . . . how will you ever find out . .  .\r\n\nif neither one of us talk[]?\" provided further corroboration.\r\n\nAdditional support could be  inferred from the ample evidence\r\n\nthe government adduced  establishing Trenkler's  relationship\r\n\nwithShayJr.and hisknowledgeofbothelectronics andexplosives.23\r\n\n          Furthermore,  the  government  offered   the  EXIS-\r\n\nderived  evidence to  prove  that the  Roslindale and  Quincy\r\n\nbombs  were so similar that  they evinced the  signature of a\r\n\nsingle bomb  maker, thus,  establishing the relevance  of the\r\n\nQuincy bomb evidence on the issue of identity.  Our review of\r\n\nthe  record,  however,  convinces  us  that the  EXIS-derived\r\n\nevidence  was not a  critical factor in  the district court's\r\n\ndecision to admit the Quincy bomb evidence for the purpose of\r\n\nproving  identity.   The  EXIS-derived  evidence  was  merely\r\n\ncumulative,  corroborating the testimony  of the government's\r\n\nexplosives expert  who, after testifying in  detail about the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n23.  We note  with some  concern  our dissenting  colleague's\r\nsuggestion   that,   notwithstanding   Lindholm's   testimony\r\n(elicited by the  U.S. Attorney) that the  government had not\r\noffered  or  promised  Lindholm  any  consideration  for  his\r\ntestimony, an  implicit quid pro quo  nonetheless existed for\r                                                \r\nhis cooperation.  See infra  at 65 n.43.  We find  nothing in\r                                       \r\nthe record to support such an inference.\r\n\n                             -40-\r                                          40\r\r\n\nsimilarities between the  two bombs,  stated that  he had  no\r\n\ndoubt \"whatsoever\"  that the same person  built both bombs.24\r\n\nMoreover, as  discussed supra at  20-26, other circumstantial\r                                         \r\n\nevidence tending  to show that the maker  of each bomb used a\r\n\nsimilar modus operandi (e.g., both  bombs built for a friend,\r                                        \r\n\nboth  bomb   makers  used  third  party   to  acquire  needed\r\n\ncomponents)  independently supported  the inference  that the\r\n\nsame  person built both  bombs.  Finally,  even putting aside\r\n\nwhether  the   jury  would  have  found   the  two  incidents\r\n\nsufficiently  similar to  prove  identity without  the  EXIS-\r\n\nderived evidence,  the jury nonetheless would  have been able\r\n\nto consider the fact that Trenkler had designed and built the\r\n\nQuincy bomb to prove Trenkler's knowledge and skill.\r\n\n          In  sum, while  the admission  of the  EXIS-derived\r\n\nevidence would not have been harmless error if the only other\r\n\nevidence consisted of the expert's testimony of signature and\r\n\nthe  evidence establishing Trenkler's  relationship with Shay\r\n\nJr. and  his electrical and explosive  skills, the additional\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n24.  Our dissenting colleague correctly notes that, in ruling\r\non the  admission of the  Quincy bomb evidence,  the district\r\ncourt stated that it was \"adding\" the statistical evidence to\r\nthe expert's testimony.   But we  differ from his  conclusion\r\nthat  it is  \"plain\" that  the district  court relied  on the\r\nEXIS-derived  evidence  to  form  \"the  critical  final  link\r\nbetween  the  two devices,\"  see infra  at  55.   Indeed, the\r                                                  \r\ncourt's discussion focuses entirely on  the expert testimony,\r\nwith  only the  passing  reference at  the  end to  the  EXIS\r\nsystem.

We agree with our dissenting brother that we may find an\r\nerror harmless beyond a reasonable  doubt only when the other\r\nevidence in the case, \"standing alone, provides `overwhelming\r\nevidence'  of  the  defendant's  guilt.\"    See  infra at  53\r                                                                  \r\n(quoting Clark v.

Critical to the  Bruton Court's decision was the\r                                                \r\n\ntrial  court's  undisputed  ruling  that the  confession  was\r\n\ninadmissible  against the non-confessing  defendant.

Bruton has  no application  in the  present case,\r                              \r\n\nhowever, because the challenged statements here were directly\r\n\nadmissible against Trenkler and,  consequently, did not  pose\r\n\nthe Bruton risk of  spill-over prejudice.  In this  case, the\r                      \r\n\ndistrict court  admitted the  statements against  Trenkler to\r\n\nestablish the existence of the conspiracy.  \r\n\n          The Confrontation Clause does not proscribe the use\r\n\nof  all out-of-court statements.

Trenkler   does  not  challenge  this\r\n\nassumption,  nor  does  he  explain  why  the  statements  in\r\n\nquestion lack \"particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\"\r\n\nAccordingly,  we are  not persuaded  that the  district court\r\n\nviolated Trenkler's confrontation rights by admitting them.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          For the  foregoing  reasons, we  affirm  Trenkler's\r\n\nconviction.\r\n\n                             -44-\r                                          44\r\r\n\n                              Dissent follows.\r                                          Dissent follows.\r\n\n                             -45-\r                                          45\r\r\n\n          TORRUELLA, Chief Judge, (Dissenting).

The  government's  central\r\n\nstrategy at trial27 was  to prove that the Quincy  device was\r\n\nso similar to the Roslindale bomb  that they had to have been\r\n\nbuilt by  the same person.   Stephen Scheid,  an Intelligence\r\n\nResearch Specialist  with the Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco and\r\n\nFirearms  (\"ATF\"), testified  that  he  conducted a  computer\r\n\nquery  on   the  ATF's  EXIS  database28   to  identify  bomb\r\n\nincidents  which  shared  certain  characteristics  with  the\r\n\nRoslindale incident.  Based on this analysis, Scheid told the\r\n\njury that,  out of the 14,252 bombings and attempted bombings\r\n\nreported  in  EXIS,  only   the  Roslindale  and  the  Quincy\r\n\nincidents shared all the queried characteristics.\r\n\n          For a jury  reviewing otherwise weak circumstantial\r\n\nevidence of  defendant's guilt (see infra),  this is powerful\r                                                     \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n27.  In  support of its motion in limine to admit evidence of\r\nthe 1986 incident, the  government described this evidence as\r\n\"the centerpiece of the Government's case in chief.\"\r\n\n28.  For a description of the EXIS database, see supra p. 8.\r                                                                  \r\n\n                             -46-\r                                          46\r\r\n\nstuff  --  tangible,  \"scientific\"  evidence which  seems  to\r\n\nconclusively  establish that  the  same person  who made  the\r\n\nQuincy  device in  1986  made the  Roslindale  bomb in  1991.\r\n\nUnfortunately, as  the majority  concedes,  the reports  from\r\n\nwhich the EXIS information is derived are utterly unreliable,\r\n\nthus  rendering its  conclusion equally  unreliable, and,  as\r\n\nwill  be shown,  completely  misleading.   For three  related\r\n\nreasons,  I  disagree  with  the majority's  conclusion  that\r\n\nadmission of the EXIS-derived  evidence  was \"harmless beyond\r\n\na  reasonable  doubt.\"    First,  the  EXIS-derived  evidence\r\n\nplainly influenced the district court's decision to allow the\r\n\ngovernment's motion to admit evidence of the Quincy incident,\r\n\nunder Fed. R. Evid. 404(b), to show that the same person must\r\n\nhave  built the  Roslindale bomb.   Second,  the EXIS-derived\r\n\nevidence  was very powerful and very  misleading.  Third, the\r                                                \r\n\nother evidence against Trenkler was not \"overwhelming,\" as is\r\n\nrequired under our precedent.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n          The  majority  assumes,   without  deciding,   that\r\n\nTrenkler's  Sixth  Amendment  right  to   confront  witnesses\r\n\nagainst him was violated  by introduction of the EXIS-derived\r\n\nevidence.

Because  the  majority  barely\r\n\nacknowledges, much less  discusses, the constitutional  right\r\n\nat stake in this case,  its result appears both  analytically\r\n\nsound and benign.  It is  neither.  I will therefore begin by\r\n\nexplaining  why,   and  to  what   extent,  Trenkler's  Sixth\r\n\nAmendment   right  to  confront  witnesses  against  him  was\r\n\nviolated.

The\r\n\nindividuals who reported those bomb incidents  were witnesses\r\n\nagainst Trenkler,  each of them testifying,  in effect: \"This\r\n\nbomb incident  had the  following characteristics  .  . .  .\"\r\n\nDespite the importance of their \"testimony,\" neither Trenkler\r\n\nnor the jury  ever saw  any of these  witnesses.

Because they\r\n\nwere  not subject  to cross-examination,  neither we  nor the\r\n\njury  will  ever  know,  for  example,  the  answers  to  the\r\n\nfollowing questions.  Were the authors of these reports  bomb\r\n\nexperts?   Were they even  police officers?   Did they follow\r\n\ncertain procedures  in compiling  evidence?  In  filing their\r\n\nreports?  What criteria did they use for determining that the\r\n\ndevice in question was  a quote \"bomb\"?   Did they even  have\r\n\nfirst hand knowledge of  the devices, or was the  information\r\n\nprovided to them second-hand from lay  witnesses?  Scheid did\r\n\nnot  know the  answers to  these questions,  nor did  he have\r\n\nfirst hand  knowledge of  the incidents themselves,  supra p.\r                                                                      \r\n\n34,  thus making  it  impossible for  Trenkler's attorney  to\r\n\neffectively cross-examine  him.   Moreover,  Scheid  admitted\r\n\nthat  the bomb reports need  not be signed,  and that nothing\r                                                      \r\n\nrequired the author  of a submitted  report to have  personal\r\n\nknowledge of its contents.33\r\n\n          The majority  also alludes  to  a potentially  more\r\n\npernicious problem concerning the EXIS-derived evidence.  The\r\n\nmajority  notes that  the database  entry for  the Roslindale\r\n\nincident   lists  approximately   twenty-two  characteristics\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n33.  Even  the majority  questions the  validity of  the EXIS\r\nconclusion that only the  Roslindale and Quincy devices share\r\nthe  same  characteristics.    As the  majority  points  out,\r\nbecause we  know absolutely nothing about  how the underlying\r\nEXIS reports were generated, there is no way to know what the\r\nabsence of an item at a bomb site means.  Both Scheid and the\r\ngovernment's explosives expert admitted as much.  Supra n.21.\r                                                                   \r\n\n                             -51-\r                                          51\r\r\n\ndescribing  that  incident, but  Scheid,  inexplicably, chose\r\n\nonly  to query ten  of those characteristics.34   Supra n.21.\r                                                                   \r\n\nThe  majority notes  that there  is nothing  to suggest  that\r\n\nthese  ten  characteristics are  more  important  to a  bomb-\r\n\nsignature analysis than any  of the other characteristics not\r\n\nchosen.  Scheid offers  no reason why he chose to  query only\r\n\ncertain generic characteristics instead  of the more specific\r\n\ncharacteristics of  the Roslindale bomb, which  would be more\r\n\nevincing of  a \"signature.\"   For example, the  Quincy device\r\n\nwould not have been a match if Scheid had queried  any of the\r\n\nfollowing  characteristics of the  Roslindale bombing: Futaba\r\n\nantenna, Rockstar detonator, use of dynamite, nails, glue, 6-\r\n\nvolt battery,  slide switch,  paint, magazine page,  or black\r\n\nelectrical  tape.    The   majority  leaves  the  implication\r\n\nunspoken.     I  will  not  be  so  discreet.    The  obvious\r\n\nimplication   is   that    Scheid   chose   the    particular\r\n\ncharacteristics in an attempt to find a match with the Quincy\r\n\ndevice.   This  implication  is enforced  by  the fact  that,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n34.  The  queried   characteristics  were  1)   bombings  and\r\nattempted bombings; 2) involving cars or trucks; 3) with bomb\r\nplaced  under the car or  truck; 4) using remote-control; and\r\n5) magnets.  EXIS listed seven incidents which included these\r\ncharacteristics.   Scheid testified that he  then performed a\r\nmanual   query   of   the   seven   incidents   using   other\r\ncharacteristics of  the Roslindale  bombing.  He  checked the\r\nother  incidents to  see if  they involved  1) duct  tape; 2)\r\nsoldering;  3) AA batteries; 4) a toggle switch; and 5) round\r                                                                         \r\nmagnets.   Scheid  did  not  check all  14,252  bombings  and\r\nattempted bombings for these latter characteristics, only the\r\nseven.  \r\n\n                             -52-\r                                          52\r\r\n\naccording to Scheid's own  testimony, the Quincy incident was\r\n\nnot  entered into  the  database until  after the  Roslindale\r                                                         \r\n\nincident.   That  is,  government agents  brought the  Quincy\r\n\nbombing  to  Scheid's  attention   when  they  asked  him  to\r\n\ninvestigate the Roslindale bombing.  \r\n\n          The majority  thinks these concerns go  more to the\r\n\nweight  of the  evidence than  to its  admissibility;  to the\r\n\ncontrary,  they go directly  to the  question of  whether the\r\n\nevidence  has  particularized  guarantees of  trustworthiness\r\n\nunder  the Confrontation  Clause.   They demonstrate  that it\r\n\ndoes not.  Because  the reports upon which the  EXIS evidence\r\n\nis  based are  inherently  and utterly  unreliable, the  EXIS\r\n\nevidence  itself is  inherently and  utterly unreliable,  and\r\n\nTrenkler's Sixth  Amendment right  to confront  the witnesses\r\n\nagainst him was violated.  See  Wright, 497 U.S. at 805.  The\r                                                  \r\n\nquestion then becomes whether  this error was harmless beyond\r\n\na reasonable doubt.35\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n35.

First, it is clear to me that the\r\n\ndistrict court  relied on the  improper EXIS evidence  in its\r\n\ndecision  to allow the government  to present evidence of the\r\n\nQuincy incident  to  the jury  to prove  identity under  Rule\r\n\n404(b).\r\n\n          At the hearing  on its  motion in  limine to  admit\r\n\nevidence of the  Quincy incident under Fed. R.  Evid. 404(b),\r\n\nthe government presented the  testimony of Scheid,  regarding\r\n\nthe  EXIS  computer  analysis,   and  the  testimony  of  the\r\n\ngovernment's bomb expert, Waskom,  who testified that, in his\r\n\nopinion, the  Quincy and  Roslindale devices were  so similar\r\n\nthat they must have been built by the same person.   In turn,\r\n\nTrenkler presented expert testimony that the devices were too\r\n\ndifferent for anyone  to be  able to determine  if they  were\r\n\nbuilt by the same  person.  After hearing this  evidence, the\r\n\ndistrict court concluded that  \"the similarities [between the\r\n\ntwo incidents] are sufficient to admit the evidence under the\r\n\nrules established . . . by the First Circuit.\"\r\n\n          The majority states that,  based upon its review of\r\n\nthe record, it is convinced that the EXIS-based evidence \"was\r\n\nnot a  critical factor  in the  district court's decision  to\r\n\n                             -55-\r                                          55\r\r\n\nadmit the Quincy bomb evidence for purposes of identity.  The\r\n\nEXIS-derived  evidence  was merely  cumulative, corroborating\r\n\nthe testimony of the  government's explosives expert.\"  Supra\r                                                                         \r\n\npp.  39-40.   Yet the record  demonstrates that  the district\r\n\ncourt  judge  thought otherwise  when  she  decided to  admit\r\n\nevidence of the 1986 Quincy incident.  In her oral opinion on\r\n\nthe government's  motion, the  district court judge  began by\r\n\nsummarizing the testimony of Waskom, and then stated: \"Adding\r                                                                         \r\n\nto  this evidence,  the  statistical evidence  from the  EXIS\r                             \r\n\nsystem, I am persuaded that the  two devices are sufficiently\r\n\nsimilar  to prove that the  same person built  them, and thus\r\n\nrelevant to the issues in this case.\"  (emphasis added).  The\r\n\ndistrict  court  judge did  not  say that  the  EXIS evidence\r\n\n\"corroborated\" Waskom's testimony.  She stated that, when she\r\n\nadds  the EXIS  evidence to  Waskom's testimony,  she becomes\r                \r\n\nconvinced that the  two devices are sufficiently similar.  It\r\n\nis plain that  the district  court judge relied  on the  EXIS\r\n\nevidence to  form the  critical final  link  between the  two\r\n\ndevices.  Indeed, in arguing its motion, the government chose\r\n\nto  first present the EXIS  evidence and then  to present the\r\n\nWaskom testimony,  suggesting that it intended  the latter to\r\n\ncorroborate  the  former.    The district  court's  erroneous\r\n\ndetermination that  the EXIS evidence was  admissible led not\r\n\nonly to  the jury hearing that evidence, but also to the jury\r\n\nhearing Waskom's testimony with respect to the two incidents.\r\n\n                             -56-\r                                          56\r\r\n\nI cannot  agree, therefore,  that admission of  this evidence\r\n\nwas harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\n          The  second  reason  that  admission  of  the  EXIS\r\n\nevidence cannot  be considered harmless is that  this type of\r\n\n\"scientific\" evidence  is too  misleading, too powerful,  and\r\n\nhas  too  great  a potential  impact  on  lay  jurors, to  be\r\n\ndisregarded as harmless.\r\n\n          The  EXIS-derived  evidence was,  in the  best case\r\n\nscenario, unintentionally misleading, and, in the  worst case\r\n\nscenario,  deliberately skewed.    Scheid testified  that, in\r\n\nentering information about the  Quincy incident into the EXIS\r\n\ndatabase, he relied solely on a laboratory report prepared in\r\n\n1986 by  investigators from  the Massachusetts  Department of\r\n\nPublic  Safety.  This report  does not state  that the Quincy\r\n\ndevice was  attached to the  underside of the  Capeway truck.\r\n\nRather,  it  refers  only   to  an  \"[e]xplosion  on  truck.\"\r\n\nSomebody must have given Scheid further information about the\r\n\nQuincy  explosion because  he  entered \"under  vehicle\" as  a\r\n\ncharacteristic  of  the  Quincy   incident.    The   majority\r\n\nacknowledges these facts but, inexplicably, makes no comment.\r\n\nSee  supra n.8.  These facts are important for three reasons.\r                      \r\n\nFirst,  they  illustrate the  fallibility  of  the underlying\r\n\nreports.   How many of  the other 14,232  reports had similar\r\n\ndefects?   Second, they illustrate  how easily  one wrong  or\r\n\nincomplete  entry can affect a  query result.   If Scheid had\r\n\n                             -57-\r                                          57\r\r\n\nactually followed  the report, the Quincy  incident would not\r\n\nhave  matched the Roslindale  bombing because  Scheid's query\r\n\nentry  was  for  a  bomb \"under  vehicle.\"36  Finally,  these\r\n\nfacts  indicate  that  the  EXIS  test  was  skewed  (whether\r\n\nintentionally or unintentionally) to find a match between the\r\n\nQuincy and Roslindale incidents.37\r\n\n          The  EXIS-derived  evidence   is  also   misleading\r\n\nbecause it focuses the jury's attention on  the trees instead\r\n\nof the forest. By  focusing on similar minor aspects  between\r\n\nthe  two devices -- e.g., duct tape, magnets and soldering --\r\n\nthe  majority  completely brushes  aside  the  fact that  the\r\n\ncentral and most  important ingredient in the  two devices is\r\n\nfundamentally different.   The central ingredient  in a bomb,\r\n\none would think, is  the explosive content (in much  the same\r\n\nway that the central ingredient in a high-performance  car is\r\n\nthe engine).  The Roslindale bomb used two to three sticks of\r\n\ndynamite  -- a very  powerful explosive.   The  Quincy device\r                    \r\n\nused an M-21 Hoffman  artillery simulator, which is a  device\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n36.  The majority acknowledges that \"[t]he statement that out\r\nof more  than 14,000 bombing and  attempted bombing incidents\r\nin the EXIS database only the Roslindale and Quincy incidents\r\nshare  the eight  specific queried  characteristics (bombings\r\nand attempted bombings, attached  under car or truck, remote-\r\ncontrol,  round magnets,  duct  tape,  solder, AA  batteries,\r\ntoggle switches) is a  fairly powerful statement, but perhaps\r                                                                         \r\na somewhat misleading one.\"  Supra n.21 (emphasis added).\r                                              \r\n\n37.  As discussed previously, there is other  evidence (i.e.,\r\nthe suspect nature of Scheid's query choices) which  tends to\r\nshow  that the  EXIS query  may have been  skewed to  reach a\r\npredictable result.  See supra pp. 50-51. \r                                          \r\n\n                             -58-\r                                          58\r\r\n\nused  by the  military to  simulate, in  a safe  fashion, the\r                                                                    \r\n\nflash and noise of artillery.  The simulator is, in effect, a\r\n\nfirecracker-like device; it has no where near the strength of\r\n\ndynamite.   In stark contrast to dynamite, a simulator is not\r\n\ndesigned to cause physical or property damage.  Indeed, while\r\n\nthe Roslindale  device created  an explosion large  enough to\r\n\nkill, the Quincy device caused no visible damage to the truck\r\n\nit  was placed  under.   Equating  the  two devices  is  like\r\n\nequating a BB gun with a high caliber rifle.38\r\n\n          The misleading nature of the EXIS-derived statement\r\n\nis compounded  by the nature  of its  source, and the  way in\r\n\nwhich it  was presented  to the  jury.  Not  only is  it rank\r\n\nhearsay evidence, it is hearsay evidence wrapped in a  shroud\r\n\nof \"scientific\" authenticity.  This  is not a paid government\r\n\nexpert testifying that, in his opinion, the two  devices were\r                                                  \r\n\nbuilt by the same  person; this is a computer  declaring that\r                                                         \r\n\nthe two devices  were built  by the same  person.   Computers\r\n\ndeal in facts,39  not opinions.   Computers are  not paid  by\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n38.  Federal authorities apparently  did not deem the  Quincy\r\nincident serious enough to  warrant bringing charges  against\r\nTrenkler  pursuant   to   18  U.S.C.      844(i)   (malicious\r\ndestruction of property by means of an explosive), one of the\r\nstatutes  at issue in this case.  State charges stemming from\r\nthe Quincy incident were dismissed.\r\n\n39.  Of course,  the facts generated by the computer are only\r\nas accurate  and reliable  as the  facts fed  into it  by its\r\noperator.  As the majority recognizes, in this case the facts\r\nfed  into  the  computer   were,  unbeknownst  to  the  jury,\r\nmanifestly unreliable.   Thus, its conclusion  based on those\r\nfacts is similarly unreliable.\r\n\n                             -59-\r                                          59\r\r\n\none side to testify.  Computers do not have  prejudices.  And\r\n\ncomputers  are not subject  to cross-examination.   Moreover,\r\n\nthe  chart of the EXIS  queries performed by  Scheid, and the\r\n\nprintouts of  the results  of those queries,  were introduced\r\n\ninto  evidence  and  presented   as  exhibits  to  the  jury.\r\n\nConsequently, the jury had this misleading, physical evidence\r\n\nwith them in the  jury room during deliberations.40   Does it\r\n\nnot  stand to reason that  the lay juror  will accord greater\r\n\nweight to a computer's written findings than to the testimony\r\n\nof a government expert witness?   The common-sense answer is,\r\n\nof course.41\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n40.

Is it\r\n\nnot also equally plausible  that the jury relied solely  upon\r                                                                   \r\n\nthe  EXIS-derived  evidence   in  reaching  its   conclusion?\r\n\nBecause the EXIS-derived statement  came from a computer, and\r\n\nwas presented in tangible, exhibit  form, it is more powerful\r\n\nand  seemingly credible  evidence  to  a  lay jury  than  the\r\n\ntestimony of a human being.  The jury may well have relied on\r\n\nthe  EXIS-derived  evidence  to  break the  tie  between  the\r\n\ncompeting experts.

The  majority  points  to  a\r                     \r\n\nconglomeration   of  other  testimony   in  support   of  its\r\n\nconclusion   that  there   was   \"substantial  evidence\"   of\r\n\nTrenkler's guilt,  independent of  the Quincy incident.   The\r\n\ntest,  of  course,  is  not  whether  there  is  \"substantial\r\n\nevidence\"   of  Trenkler's   guilt  but   whether  there   is\r\n\n\"overwhelming  evidence\"  of  Trenkler's   guilt.    The  two\r                         \r\n\nstandards are qualitatively and quantitatively different.  In\r\n\nany case, I will  begin by addressing Trenkler's \"statements\"\r\n\nto government agents.\r\n\n          ATF  Agent  D'Ambrosio  testified  that   he  asked\r\n\nTrenkler  to  draw  a  sketch of  the  Quincy  device,  which\r\n\nTrenkler  did.    D'Ambrosio  then  told  Trenkler  that  the\r\n\nRoslindale bomb  also used  remote control, but  that, rather\r\n\nthan a firecracker type device, it used dynamite.  D'Ambrosio\r\n\nasked  Trenkler  how, in  light  of these  facts,  the wiring\r\n\ndiagram  he had just drawn  for the Quincy  device would have\r\n\nbeen  different for the Roslindale bomb. D'Ambrosio testified\r\n\nthat Trenkler then drew  a diagram which showed  two blasting\r\n\ncaps  inserted into  two sticks  of  dynamite.   The majority\r\n\nconsiders  this  significant  evidence  of  Trenkler's  guilt\r\n\nbecause the fact that the Roslindale bomb used blasting  caps\r\n\nhad not been publicly disclosed.  The majority fails to note,\r\n\nhowever, that D'Ambrosio actually testified that at least two\r                                                                     \r\n\nblasting caps  were used  in the  Roslindale bombing.   Thus,\r\n\n                             -63-\r                                          63\r\r\n\nTrenkler's drawing of only two blasting caps was not an exact\r\n\nmatch.  Moreover,  the jury heard evidence that  Trenkler had\r\n\nextensive knowledge of both electronics and explosives, so it\r\n\nis  not necessarily  significant  that Trenkler  was able  to\r\n\nreconstruct an  aspect of  the Roslindale bomb,  particularly\r\n\nconsidering the  information concerning the bomb  provided to\r\n\nTrenkler  by D'Ambrosio.    Trenkler  merely identified  that\r\n\nblasting caps  were a likely way in which a bomb of this size\r\n\nand  power would  be  constructed.   In  the absence  of  any\r\n\ntestimony  that the use of blasting caps is unusual or unique\r\n\n(a proposition which is highly unlikely), the jury could only\r\n\nspeculate as to the significance of the drawing.\r\n\n          The majority  also finds significance in  ATF Agent\r\n\nLeahy's testimony that Trenkler  said to him: \"If we  did it,\r\n\nthen only we know about it . . . how will you ever find out .\r\n\n.  . if neither one of us  talk[]?\"  The majority paints this\r\n\nstatement in a confessional light.  This testimony may or may\r\n\nnot have  been of some  circumstantial relevance to  the jury\r\n\n(although  standing  alone,  of   course,  it  would  not  be\r\n\nsufficient  to sustain a conviction).  But, upon review, when\r\n\nthe court  is looking  for \"overwhelming evidence  of guilt,\"\r\n\none would  think the court would  not have to resort  to this\r\n\nsort of  an ambiguous, taunting statement.42   Similarly, the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n42.  In  Coppola,  for  example,  we lent  little  weight  to\r                            \r\ndefendant's statement to  another inmate -- \"What did  I have\r\nto  lose?\"  --  in response  to  a  question  whether he  had\r\n\n                             -64-\r                                          64\r\r\n\ncourt notes that  there was evidence  that Trenkler and  Shay\r\n\nknew  each other,  and that  Trenkler  had knowledge  of both\r\n\nelectronics and  explosives.   While the jury  might consider\r\n\nthis type of circumstantial  evidence relevant, it can hardly\r\n\nbe  said  that  it   does  much  in  the  way   of  providing\r\n\n\"overwhelming  evidence\" of  defendant's guilt.   Cf.  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.  Innamorati, 996  F.2d  456, 476  (1st  Cir. 1993)\r                                  \r\n\n(holding that the  erroneous admission  of inculpatory  grand\r\n\njury testimony  was harmless  beyond a reasonable  doubt when\r\n\nseven people testified at trial that defendant was engaged in\r                 \r\n\nmarijuana and cocaine dealing, and drugs and money were found\r\n\nin defendant's constructive possession).\r\n\n          The majority  relies most heavily on  the testimony\r\n\nof David  Lindholm, who testified that  Trenkler confessed to\r\n\nbuilding the Roslindale bomb.  But Lindholm had  some serious\r\n\ncredibility problems which make his testimony \"shaky,\" to say\r\n\nthe  least.  Lindholm  testified that  he met  Trenkler while\r\n\nLindholm was  serving a  97-month sentence for  conspiracy to\r\n\ndistribute marijuana  and tax evasion.   He further testified\r\n\nthat he was in the marijuana business from approximately 1969\r\n\nthrough 1988, and that he did not pay any income taxes during\r\n\nthat  time.  Lindholm also testified that, in order to secure\r\n\nbank loans to purchase property during that period, he showed\r\n\nseveral  banks false  income tax  returns.   On the  basis of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ncommitted the rape.  See 878 F.2d at 1569-70.  \r                                    \r\n\n                             -65-\r                                          65\r\r\n\nLindholm's shady  past alone, the jury  might have completely\r\n\ndisregarded his testimony.\r\n\n          But Lindholm also had some less obvious credibility\r\n\nproblems.   The circumstances of his  meeting Trenkler strike\r\n\nme as a little too coincidental.  On December 17, 1992, after\r\n\na year and a half incarceration in Texas, Lindholm is brought\r\n\nback to Boston concerning certain unspecified charges related\r\n\nto his conviction.  He is then placed in the orientation unit\r\n\nat  the Plymouth  House of  Correction where he  meets Alfred\r\n\nTrenkler, who is being held in connection with the Roslindale\r\n\nbombing.   The two  subsequently discover that  they have  an\r\n\nextraordinary amount  in common.   First, they are  both from\r\n\nthe town of Milton, Massachusetts.  Second, Trenkler attended\r\n\nThayer Academy and Milton Academy, and Lindholm's father also\r\n\nattended Thayer Academy and Milton Academy.  Third, they both\r\n\nlived for a time -- overlapping by one year --  on White Lawn\r\n\nAvenue  in  Milton.     Based  on  these  commonalities,  and\r\n\nLindholm's   generosity  in  sharing  his  knowledge  of  the\r\n\ncriminal   justice  system   with  Trenkler,   they   form  a\r\n\nfriendship.  Trenkler then,  allegedly, confesses to Lindholm\r\n\nthat he built the bomb.\r\n\n          In  my  view,  a  reasonable juror  might  question\r\n\nwhether Lindholm  was placed in  the orientation unit  by the\r\n\ngovernment  for the  purpose of  obtaining a  confession from\r\n\nTrenkler.    If so,  that  juror  would  likely  wonder  what\r\n\n                             -66-\r                                          66\r\r\n\nLindholm got in return.  Not surprisingly, Lindholm testified\r\n\nthat he had no agreements with the government and that he did\r\n\nnot   receive   any   promises   or   inducements   for   his\r\n\ntestimony.43  He  did testify on  cross-examination, however,\r\n\nthat he knew, when he provided the information about Trenkler\r\n\nto the  government, that the  only way his  97-month sentence\r\n\ncould  be reduced was if  he supplied new  information to the\r\n\ngovernment.44\r\n\n          We  do  not  know how  much  weight  the  jury gave\r\n\nLindholm's  testimony, but we do know that, at least on paper\r\n\n-- for we  did not observe his demeanor at  trial -- Lindholm\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n43.  If  the  government  makes  an  explicit  promise  to  a\r\nwitness,  of course, this will  come out at  trial and likely\r\ndecrease the  witness's credibility in the eyes  of the jury.\r\nBut if the government lawyers explain to the witness why they\r\ndo  not  want to  make  any  explicit promises,  leaving  the\r\ninference that one good deed begets  another, the witness can\r\ntestify that he  has no agreement.   I note, in this  regard,\r\nthat  this court  has previously  questioned the  validity of\r\nthese \"no agreement\" statements by criminal defendants.  See,\r                                                                        \r\ne.g., Coppola, 878 F.2d at 1569-70.\r                         \r\n\n44.  When  asked  on  direct  examination  why  he testified,\r\nLindholm stated:\r\n\n          Since  I have  been incarcerated,  I have\r\n          come to realize that the sole function of\r\n          prison  is not just  punishment.  I think\r\n          rehabilitation   is   important  for   an\r\n          individual.   And  I  think, when  I talk\r\n          about     rehabilitation,      I     mean\r\n          rehabilitation  of  a person's  values in\r\n          terms of how they live one's life and the\r\n          decisions   they    make,   knowing   the\r\n          difference   between  what's   wrong  and\r\n          what's right, what's illegal and legal.\r\n\n                             -67-\r                                          67\r\r\n\nhad some significant  credibility problems.  Consequently,  I\r\n\ncannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would\r\n\nhave believed his  testimony; particularly in a  case such as\r\n\nthis  where there  is absolutely  no physical  evidence tying\r                                                                   \r\n\nTrenkler  to  the bombing.   Cf.  Coppola,  878 F.2d  at 1571\r                                                     \r\n\n(discounting  inculpatory  testimony  of three  jail  inmates\r\n\nbecause  it \"raises  serious  questions  of credibility\"  and\r\n\nnoting the absence of  any conclusive physical evidence tying\r\n\nthe defendant to the  crime).  The only evidence  coming near\r\n\nthatlevelofreliability wastheimproperlyadmitted EXISevidence.\r\n\n          Absent the EXIS-derived evidence,  the government's\r\n\ncase   against  Trenkler   consists  of   a   smorgasbord  of\r\n\ninconclusive  circumstantial  evidence   and  an   inherently\r\n\nunreliable  alleged jailhouse  confession.   Faced with  this\r\n\nsort  of evidence, a reasonable jury  would probably look for\r\n\nsome  sort of tangible evidence  upon which to  hang its hat.\r\n\nThe  EXIS-derived evidence was just that.  Because it was the\r\n\nonly ostensibly  conclusive evidence  tying  Trenkler to  the\r\n\ncrime,  it may  have been  the clincher  for the  jury.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nCoppola, 878 F.2d  at 1571.   It was  therefore not  harmless\r                   \r\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\n                              V.\r                                          V.\r                                            \r\n\n          A horrible crime was  committed in which one police\r\n\nofficer was  killed and  another seriously injured.   Society\r\n\nrightfully demands that the guilty be apprehended, tried, and\r\n\n                             -68-\r                                          68\r\r\n\npunished.  But the distinguishing feature of our legal system\r\n\nis  that  even  those   charged  with  grotesque  crimes  are\r\n\nguaranteed certain  constitutional rights intended  to ensure\r\n\nthat  they receive a fair trial.  Unfortunately, and with all\r\n\ndue respect to  my brethren, I believe  the defendant's right\r\n\nto  a  fair  trial  was  violated  when  the  government  was\r\n\npermitted   to  introduce  the  highly  prejudicial  evidence\r\n\nderived from the EXIS computer database.   Because this error\r\n\nso severely  violated  defendant's Sixth  Amendment right  to\r\n\nconfront the witnesses against him, and because the remainder\r\n\nof  the  evidence  against  him  was  not  \"overwhelming,\"  I\r\n\ndissent.\r\n\n                             -69-\r                                          69\r\r\n",

On appeal, Trenkler challenges the admission of evidence relating to his participation in a prior bombing that occurred five years earlier in Quincy, Massachusetts (\"the Quincy bomb\").  Trenkler also assigns error to two evidentiary rulings admitting evidence derived from a computer database that purported to establish that Trenkler built both the Quincy and the Roslindale bombs and several out-of-court statements made by a fellow participant in the bombing.  After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 28, 1991, a bomb exploded at the Roslindale home of Thomas L. Shay (\"Shay Sr.\"), killing one Boston police officer and severely injuring another.  The two officers, members of the Boston Police Department Bomb Squad, had been dispatched to Shay Sr.'s home to investigate a suspicious object located in Shay Sr.'s driveway.  Shay Sr. had earlier reported that, while backing his 1986 Buick Century into the street the day before, he had heard a loud noise emanating from beneath the floorboard of his automobile.  Shay Sr. added that, subsequently, he found the suspicious object resting near the crest of his driveway.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the explosion, a massive investigation ensued involving a variety of federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies.  On June 24, 1993, this investigation culminated with the return of a three-count indictment charging Trenkler and Thomas A. Shay (\"Shay Jr.\"), Shay Sr.'s son, with responsibility for the Roslindale bombing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Trenkler filed a successful severance motion, and the government tried the two defendants separately.  Shay Jr. was tried first, and a jury convicted him on counts of conspiracy and malicious destruction of property by means of explosives.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Trenkler's trial, the thrust of the government's case was that Trenkler had built the Roslindale bomb for Shay Jr. to use against his father.  To establish Trenkler's identity as the builder of the bomb, the government offered, inter alia, evidence that Trenkler had previously constructed a remote-control device, the Quincy bomb, which exploded in Quincy, Massachusetts, in 1986.  The government contended that unique similarities in design, choice of components, and overall modus operandi between the two bombs compelled the conclusion that Trenkler had designed and built both devices.  Prior to trial, the government filed a motion in limine seeking to admit the \"similarity\" evidence.  Following a day-long evidentiary hearing, the district court ruled the evidence admissible, finding that it was relevant on the issues of identity, skill, knowledge, and intent.  Although Trenkler did not testify at trial, his counsel stipulated at the evidentiary hearing that Trenkler had built the Quincy bomb.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1986 Quincy Bomb</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trenkler constructed the Quincy bomb in 1986 for a friend, Donna Shea.  At the time, Shea was involved in a dispute with the owners of the Capeway Fish Market and she wanted the bomb to use as a means to intimidate them.  At her request, Trenkler assembled a remote-control, radio-activated explosive device.  The device was later attached to the undercarriage of a truck belonging to the Capeway Fish Market and detonated in the middle of the night.  The resulting bomb blast caused no injuries and little property damage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In building the Quincy bomb, Trenkler used as the explosive material a military flash simulator typically utilized to mimic gunfire in combat exercises.  To provide remote-control capabilities, Trenkler employed a radio-receiver he had removed from a small toy car.  Trenkler wrapped the bomb in duct tape and attached a large donut-shaped speaker magnet to enable the bomb to adhere to the undercarriage of the truck.  Other components Trenkler used included a \"double throw\" toggle switch, four AA batteries, two six-volt batteries, an electric relay, solder, various wires, and a slide switch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testimony at trial established that Trenkler purchased some of the electrical components for the Quincy bomb from a Radio Shack store.  On one occasion, Trenkler sought to obtain needed components by sending Shea's eleven-year-old nephew into a Radio Shack store with a list of items to purchase while Trenkler remained waiting outside.  Shea's nephew, however, was unable to find all of the items, and Trenkler eventually came into the store to assist him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1991 Roslindale Bomb</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contended that Trenkler built the Roslindale bomb at Shay Jr.'s request. At trial, the government offered evidence about Trenkler's relationship with Shay Jr., dating back at least two years prior to the Roslindale bombing.  Several witnesses, including Trenkler's business partner, reported seeing the two together on different occasions in 1990 and 1991.  Shay Jr.'s address book included an entry for Trenkler listing his current pager number.  Moreover, Trenkler's roommate at the time of the Roslindale bombing testified that, during September and October of 1991, Shay Jr. left several voice-mail messages on the pager for Trenkler.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testimony from government investigators and Shay Sr. established that the Roslindale bomb was a remote-control, radio-activated device with an explosive force supplied by two or three sticks of dynamite connected to two electrical blasting caps.  A black wooden box weighing two or three pounds and measuring approximately eight- to ten-inches long, five- to six-inches wide and one- to two-inches deep housed the bomb.  A large donut-shaped magnet and several smaller round magnets attached to the box were used to secure the device to the underside of Shay Sr.'s automobile.  Other components used in the construction of the bomb included duct tape, a \"single throw\" toggle switch, four AA batteries, five nine-volt batteries, a Futaba radio receiver, solder, various wires, and a slide switch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the government's experts and Shay Sr., the bomb was originally attached to the undercarriage of Shay Sr.'s automobile directly beneath the driver's seat.  The government's explosives expert testified that if the bomb had exploded while still attached to the car, it probably would have killed or at least seriously injured any individual sitting in the driver's seat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also asserted that Trenkler used Shay Jr. to purchase the electronic components used in the bomb.  In support of this assertion, the government introduced a sales receipt for a toggle switch purchased in October 1991 at a Radio Shack store located across the street from where Trenkler, at the time, was installing a satellite dish.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (\"ATF\") recovered from the debris of the Roslindale bomb a switch identical to the one purchased.  Shay Jr. admitted purchasing the switch during a taped television interview, portions of which the government introduced at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Furthermore, a sales clerk at the Radio Shack testified that, prior to purchasing the switch, the person who bought it had browsed in the store for several minutes, appearing to shop for items written on a list.  The sales clerk also testified that he recalled seeing Trenkler in the store on two or three occasions during the fall of 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the government and Trenkler elicited testimony from their respective explosives experts explaining the similarities and differences between the two bombs.  Both experts testified at length concerning the electronic designs, the choice of components and the method of construction.  The government's expert opined that the two incidents shared many similar traits and characteristics, evincing the \"signature\" of a single bomb maker.  He further stated that he had no doubt \"whatsoever\" that the same person built both bombs.  Trenkler's expert, on the other hand, stated that too many dissimilarities existed to conclude that the same person built both bombs.  Moreover, Trenkler's expert testified that the similarities that existed lacked sufficient distinguishing qualities to identify the two bombs as the handiwork of a specific individual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>EXIS Computer Database Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support the inference that Trenkler built both bombs, the government offered testimony both at the pretrial hearing and at trial concerning information retrieved from an ATF computer database of explosives and arson incidents.  Stephen Scheid, an Intelligence Research Specialist with ATF, testified that the database, known as EXIS, contains information taken from reports submitted to ATF by various federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies.  Scheid further testified that he had been personally responsible for maintaining the database since 1977.  Scheid stated that he reviews submitted incident reports, culling from them information describing the characteristics of each bombing or arson episode.  Scheid added that he then encodes the extracted information on a standardized worksheet, which he or a data-entry person in turn uses to enter the information into the database.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scheid testified that, through the use of a computer program, he then produces investigatory leads by retrieving all incidents entered in the database that are listed as possessing a specific component or characteristic.  Scheid further testified that, in an effort to identify the builder of the Roslindale bomb, he performed a series of computer queries, focusing on characteristics of the Roslindale bomb.  This series of inquiries narrowed the field of reported incidents in the database from 40,867 to seven.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The seven remaining incidents included both the Roslindale and Quincy bombs.  Scheid stated that he subsequently conducted a manual analysis of the remaining incidents and was able to identify several additional characteristics common to only the Roslindale and Quincy bombs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scheid also testified that the report of the Quincy bomb did not come to his attention through normal procedures.  Scheid did not receive information about the 1986 Quincy bomb, nor enter any information pertaining to it into the EXIS database, until after the Roslindale incident in 1991.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Other Trial Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also offered the testimony of David Lindholm to establish that Trenkler had built the Roslindale bomb.  Lindholm testified that he met Trenkler at the Plymouth House of Correction where they had spent four days incarcerated together in an uncomfortable orientation holding cell in December 1992.  Lindholm testified that initially the cell had held about forty-four prisoners, but that eventually the total number of prisoners in the cell dwindled to six or seven.  Lindholm added that he had numerous conversations with Trenkler over the course of the four days as they gradually \"bonded\" upon discovering that they came from the same home town and had similar backgrounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lindholm testified that he gave Trenkler legal advice based on his own experience as a criminal defendant.  Lindholm acknowledged that Trenkler initially asserted his innocence and had maintained that he could not understand why Shay Jr. had implicated him in the case.  Lindholm testified further that Trenkler later told him that the government knew that some of the components used in the Roslindale bomb had been purchased locally and that, in response, Lindholm opined that the bomber had been careless not to have gone out of state.  To this, Trenkler agreed and then stated that the local purchase was \"regrettable.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Lindholm recalled that at one point during the four days they discussed Trenkler's involvement with the 1986 Quincy bomb.  Lindholm testified that, during this discussion, Trenkler asserted that the Roslindale bomb was much more powerful than the bomb he had built in 1986.  Ultimately, Lindholm stated that Trenkler admitted building the Roslindale bomb, testifying that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>[Lindholm:]  At one point he stated, [\"W]ell, even if I did build a bomb, I did not place it on the car.[\"]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>[Government:]  What happened next?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>[Lindholm:]  Then he paused for a moment and said, [\"S]o, I built the bomb.  I built the bomb.  I don't deserve to die or spend the rest of my life in prison for building this device.[\"]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lindholm added further that Trenkler \"stated that the two bomb squad officers were foolish and negligent for not wearing body armor at the time that they were examining this device, and in essence that it served them right for what happened to them.  It wasn't his fault.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of trial, Lindholm was serving sentences stemming from convictions on federal drug and tax evasion charges.  Lindholm testified that he had not received nor discussed receiving anything from the government in return for his testimony.  On cross examination, Trenkler's counsel made only a minimal effort to impeach Lindholm, raising matters unrelated to his testimony implicating Trenkler.  Primarily Trenkler's counsel attempted to challenge Lindholm's assertion that, as a small boy, he had at one time lived on the same street as Trenkler and to show that Lindholm was at the Plymouth House of Correction in December 1992 in order to provide information to the government on other individuals with whom he had been involved in past criminal activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to Lindholm's testimony, ATF Agents Dennis Leahy and Thomas D'Ambrosio recounted a November 6, 1991, interview they conducted with Trenkler shortly after the bombing.  During this interview, Trenkler admitted building the Quincy bomb and sketched a circuit diagram describing it.  After making the sketch, Agent D'Ambrosio asked Trenkler how the diagram would differ if Trenkler had used dynamite like that utilized in the Roslindale incident.  Both agents testified that, in response to this question, Trenkler drew a second diagram, which featured two sticks of dynamite connected to two electrical blasting caps.  Both agents added that they were surprised when they saw the diagram because the use of two electrical blasting caps was a distinctive feature of the Roslindale bomb that, at the time of the interview, had not been disclosed to the public.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  At trial, Leahy also related other conversations he had with Trenkler in which Trenkler conveyed a working knowledge of dynamite and electrical blasting caps.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leahy further testified about a statement Trenkler made to him at the ATF offices on February 4, 1992.  Leahy explained that Trenkler had come to the offices on his own accord to pick up previously-seized business records.  Leahy stated that, during his visit, Trenkler engaged Leahy in a long discussion, lasting more than two hours, about the course of the investigation.  According to Leahy's testimony, after Leahy had ended the discussion, Trenkler announced arrogantly upon leaving the ATF offices that \"If we did it, then only we know about it.  How will you ever find out ... if neither one of us talk[ ]?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts of the indictment.  Subsequently, the district court sentenced Trenkler to concurrent terms of life imprisonment on the counts of receipt of explosive materials and attempted malicious destruction of property by means of explosives and sixty months on the count of conspiracy.  Trenkler now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Trenkler assigns error to the admission of the Quincy bomb evidence, contending primarily that the incident was not sufficiently similar to the Roslindale bomb to be relevant on the issue of identity, and to the admission of the EXIS database-derived evidence that the government used to prove the similarity of the two bombs.  Trenkler additionally argues that the district court erroneously admitted several out-of-court statements made by Shay Jr.  We discuss each argument in turn.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Quincy Bombing Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with Trenkler's contention that the district court erred in admitting the evidence of the Quincy bombing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Fed.R.Evid. 404(b):  Other Act Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, Rule 404(b)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> proscribes the use of other bad-act evidence solely to establish that the defendant has a propensity towards criminal behavior.  Rule 404(b)'s proscription, however, is not absolute:  the rule permits the use of such evidence if it bears on a material issue such as motive, knowledge or identity.  In this Circuit, we have adopted a two-part test for determining the admissibility of Rule 404(b) evidence.  E.g., United States v. Williams, 985 F.2d 634, 637 (1st Cir.1993).  First, the district court must determine whether the evidence has some \"special relevance\" independent of its tendency simply to show criminal propensity.  E.g., United States v. Guyon, 27 F.3d 723, 728 (1st Cir.1994).  Second, if the evidence has \"special relevance\" on a material issue, the court must then carefully conduct a Rule 403<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> analysis to determine if the probative value of the evidence is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  Williams, 985 F.2d at 637.   As with most evidentiary rulings, the district court has considerable leeway in determining whether to admit or exclude Rule 404(b) evidence.  Accordingly, we review its decision only under the lens of abuse of discretion.  Id.;  see also United States v. Fields, 871 F.2d 188, 196 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 955, 110 S.Ct. 369, 107 L.Ed.2d 355 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Identity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government offered the evidence of the Quincy bomb, which Trenkler admitted building, primarily to prove that Trenkler also built the Roslindale bomb.  The government contends that the evidence of the Quincy bomb has \"special relevance\" on the issue of identity because the numerous similarities surrounding the Quincy and Roslindale incidents compel the conclusion that the same individual built both bombs.  Trenkler, on the other hand, argues that the Quincy incident is too dissimilar to be relevant on the issue of identity, and even if it has some relevance, the risk of unfair prejudice that it poses far outweighs its probative value.  We agree with the government that the Quincy bomb evidence has \"special relevance\" on the issue of identity and that the district court did not abuse its considerable discretion in admitting it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>a. Rule 404(b) Evidence:  Special Relevance</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, as in this case, Rule 404(b) evidence is offered because it has \"special relevance\" on the issue of identity, we have required, as a prerequisite to admission, a showing that there exists a high degree of similarity between the other act and the charged crime.  See United States v. Ingraham, 832 F.2d 229, 231-33 (1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1009, 108 S.Ct. 1738, 100 L.Ed.2d 202 (1988).  Indeed, the proponent must demonstrate that the two acts exhibit a commonality of distinguishing features sufficient to earmark them as the handiwork of the same individual.  Id. at 231.   This preliminary showing is necessary because</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>[a] defendant cannot be identified as the perpetrator of the charged act simply because he has at other times committed the same commonplace variety of criminal act except by reference to the forbidden inference of propensity.  The question for the court[, therefore, must be] whether the characteristics relied upon are sufficiently idiosyncratic to permit an inference of pattern for purposes of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Pisari, 636 F.2d 855, 858-59 (1st Cir.1981) (internal quotations and citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Resolving whether the prior act is sufficiently similar to the charged offense to have \"special relevance\" on the issue of identity, however, is essentially an issue of \"preliminary\" or \"conditional\" fact.  In other words, the prior act has no tendency to prove the perpetrator's identity--i.e., it is not relevant--unless the proponent can first establish the conditional fact:  that the two acts are sufficiently idiosyncratic to support the inference that they are the handiwork of the same individual.  The admissibility of evidence whose relevance turns on the resolution of a conditional fact is governed by Fed.R.Evid. 104(b).  See Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 689, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 1501, 99 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988).  Rule 104(b) provides, \"When the relevancy of evidence depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court shall admit it upon, or subject to, the introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding of the fulfillment of the condition.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 104(b).  Moreover,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>[i]n determining whether the Government has introduced sufficient evidence to meet Rule 104(b), the trial court neither weighs credibility nor makes a finding that the Government has proved the conditional fact by a preponderance of the evidence.  The court simply examines all the evidence in the case and decides whether the jury could reasonably find the conditional fact ... by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Huddleston, 485 U.S. at 690, 108 S.Ct. at 1501.   Thus, as here, when a party seeks to admit Rule 404(b) evidence to establish identity, the district court must condition its admission on a showing that the shared characteristics of the other act and the charged offense are sufficiently idiosyncratic that a reasonable jury could find it more likely than not that the same person performed them both.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trenkler contends that the array of similarities between the two incidents amounts to no more than a collection of \"prosaic commonalit[ies that] cannot give rise to an inference that the same person was involved in both acts without reference to propensity.\"  United States v. Garcia-Rosa, 876 F.2d 209, 225 (1st Cir.1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1030, 110 S.Ct. 742, 107 L.Ed.2d 760, cert. granted and vacated on other grounds sub nom., Rivera-Feliciano v. United States, 498 U.S. 954, 111 S.Ct. 377, 112 L.Ed.2d 391 (1990).  However, in resolving whether the evidence supports an inference that the two incidents are \"sufficiently idiosyncratic,\" we have cautioned that \"an exact match is not necessary.\"  Ingraham, 832 F.2d at 232.   The test must focus on the \"totality of the comparison,\" demanding not a \"facsimile or exact replica\" but rather the \" 'conjunction of several identifying characteristics or the presence of some highly distinctive quality.' \"  Id. at 232-33 (quoting Pisari, 636 F.2d at 859) (emphasis added);  see also United States v. Myers, 550 F.2d 1036, 1045 (5th Cir.1977) (\"[A] number of common features of lesser uniqueness, although insufficient to generate a strong inference of identity if considered separately, may be of significant probative value when considered together.\").  In this case, we think the balance of the evidence tilts sufficiently towards admission to satisfy the first step of the Rule 404(b) analysis.  Accordingly, we believe that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the numerous similarities in components, design, and technique of assembly, combined with the similar modus operandi and the closeness of geographic proximity between the two events, sufficiently support the inference that the same person built both bombs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that the government's explosives expert, Thomas Waskom, testified that his analysis of the similarities shared by the two incidents left him with no doubt \"whatsoever\" that the same individual built both bombs.  Our own review of the record reveals that the two bombs did indeed share a number of similar components and characteristics.  Both bombs were remote-controlled, radio-activated, electronic explosive devices.  Both were homemade mechanisms, comprising, in general, electronic components easily purchased at a hobby store.  Both had similar, though not identical, firing and fusing circuits with separate battery power supplies for each.  Both had switches in their fusing circuits to disconnect the radio receivers.  To energize their respective radio receivers, both devices utilized similar power supplies, consisting of four AA batteries.  Both employed many similar components such as batteries, duct tape, toggle switches, radio receivers, antennas, solder, electrical tape, and large round speaker magnets.  Moreover, both used a distinctive method (i.e., twisting, soldering, and taping) to connect some, though not all, of the wires used.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Though we hardly find any of these factors by themselves to be \"highly distinctive,\" the coalescence of them is fairly persuasive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Indeed, even Trenkler's expert witness, Denny Kline, testified at the pretrial hearing that, in light of these similarities, \"there is a possibility, a probability, that maybe there is a connection between the maker of these two bombs.\"  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we note that, in refusing to conclude \"beyond a reasonable doubt\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> that the same person built both bombs, Trenkler's expert Kline eschewed reliance on any factors except the physical evidence.  The appropriate test for sufficient similarity, however, is not so limited.  \"[I]n assessing the sufficiency of the evidence under Rule 104(b), the trial court must consider all evidence presented to the jury.\"  Huddleston, 485 U.S. at 690-91, 108 S.Ct. at 1502 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we believe some significance is properly attributed to the simple fact that both incidents are bombings.  A bombing, in and of itself, is, arguably, a fairly distinctive method for intimidating or killing an individual.  Cf. United States v. Patterson, 20 F.3d 809, 813 (10th Cir.1994) (in a hijacking case, uniqueness of crime itself has significance in Rule 404(b) similarity analysis), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 128, 130 L.Ed.2d 72 (1994);  Pisari, 636 F.2d at 858 (\"[M]uch more is demanded than the mere repeated commission of crimes of the same class, such as repeated burglaries or thefts.  The device used must be so unusual and distinctive as to be like a signature.\"  (quotations and citations omitted)).  In addition, both incidents involved not simply bombs, but remote-control bombs that were placed underneath automotive vehicles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In both instances, the bombs were constructed and used to benefit a friend of the builder.  Trenkler built the Quincy bomb for Donna Shea to use to intimidate the owners of the Capeway Fish Market, and the evidence supported the inference that the person who constructed the Roslindale bomb built it for Shay Jr. to use against his father.  Furthermore, in both instances the builder attempted to conceal his or her participation by using a third party to purchase the electronic components used in the explosive device.  In 1986, Trenkler initially waited in his car while sending Donna Shea's nephew into the electronics store with a list to purchase the needed components.  Similarly, the evidence supports the inference that the builder of the Roslindale bomb used Shay Jr. to purchase the needed components.  Finally, the fact that both bombings occurred within a relatively close geographic proximity must be given some weight in the analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Pisari, 636 F.2d 855 (1st Cir.1981), we reversed the district court's decision to admit evidence of a prior robbery solely on the issue of identity, where the only similarity between it and the charged offense was that a knife was used.  Similarly, in Garcia-Rosa, 876 F.2d at 224-25, we refused to sanction the admission of a prior drug transaction where the only characteristic linking it to the charged drug deal was the characteristic exchange of a sample of drugs prior to the sale.  In Garcia-Rosa, we held that a single \"prosaic commonality\" was insufficient \"to give rise to an inference that the same person was involved in both acts without reference to propensity.\"  Id. at 225.   See also United States v. Benedetto, 571 F.2d 1246, 1249 (2d Cir.1978) (no signature where shared characteristic is merely \"a similar technique for receiving the cash:  the passing of folded bills by way of a handshake\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, however, the government presented more than a single \"prosaic commonality.\"   Indeed, the government propounded a laundry list of similarities in design, component selection, construction and overall modus operandi.   On the other hand, Trenkler offered a fairly impressive list of differences between the two incidents.  In the absence of one or more highly distinctive factors that in themselves point to idiosyncracy, we must examine the combination of all the factors.  Had Trenkler been unable to point to any significant differences, we suspect he would have had little chance in establishing an abuse of discretion in allowing the evidence.  Similarly, had the government found but three or four common characteristics to establish sufficient similarity, we doubt that the admission of the evidence would have been granted or sustained.  Here, in the middle, with substantial evidence on either side and conflicting expert opinions, could a reasonable jury have found it more likely than not that the same person was responsible for both bombs?   We think the answer is yes.  See Ingraham, 832 F.2d at 233 (admitting evidence) (\"[G]iven the host of important comparables, the discrepancies--though themselves not unimportant--go to the weight of the challenged evidence, not to its admissibility.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>b.

We must also review the trial court's determination that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice.  Several factors weigh heavily in this balancing, such as the government's need for the evidence, see Fields, 871 F.2d at 198 (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) advisory committee's note), the strength of evidence establishing the similarity of the two acts, see Huddleston, 485 U.S. at 689 n. 6, 108 S.Ct. at 1501 n. 6, the inflammatory nature of the evidence, and the degree to which it would promote an inference based solely on the defendant's criminal propensity, see United States v. Rubio-Estrada, 857 F.2d 845, 851-52 (1st Cir.1988) (Torruella, J., dissenting) (explaining inherent unfair prejudice in evidence of prior bad acts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe the district court acted well within its broad discretion in admitting the evidence.  First, the evidence was important to the government's case.  The evidence that Trenkler had built the Quincy bomb corroborated David Lindholm's testimony, identifying Trenkler as the builder of the Roslindale bomb.  Second, although the evidence of similarity could have been more compelling, it was nonetheless substantial:  Indeed, the government's explosives expert testified that he had no doubt \"whatsoever\" that the same person designed and constructed both bombs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, we disagree with the district court that the evidence did not pose any risk of unfair prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  As with all \"bad act\" evidence, there is always some danger that the jury will use the evidence not on the narrow point for which it is offered but rather to infer that the defendant has a propensity towards criminal behavior.  Nonetheless, outside the context of propensity, the evidence was not unduly inflammatory.  The Quincy bomb did not kill or injure any individual and caused little property damage.  Moreover, the district court minimized any risk of unfair prejudice by carefully instructing the jury not to use the evidence of the Quincy bombing to infer Trenkler's guilt simply because he was a bad person or because the fact he had a built a bomb in the past made it more likely he had built the bomb in this case.  In sum, we believe that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the probative value of the Quincy bomb evidence was not substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>B.

He maintains that the district court erred because the underlying reports composing the EXIS database lack sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness to fall within the residual hearsay exception.

Specifically, the government offered it as an affirmative assertion that, out of more than 14,000 bombing and attempted bombing incidents, only the Roslindale and the Quincy incidents possessed in common all of the queried characteristics.  The district court admitted the EXIS-derived testimony under the residual hearsay exception, finding that it was \"sufficiently reliable.\"   In reaching this conclusion, the court noted that the EXIS database was used and relied upon \"by law enforcement authorities on a regular basis.\"   The government asserts that the district court did not err in admitting the testimony because, in general, the underlying reports were \"written objective reports\" summarizing careful field and laboratory investigations that the court could permissibly find to be particularly worthy of belief such that \"adversarial testing ... would add little to [their] reliability.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, it is evident that whether or not particular evidence may be admitted under the residual hearsay exception is a fact-specific inquiry committed in the first instance to the sound discretion of the district court.  United States v. Doe, 860 F.2d 488, 491 (1st Cir.1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1049 (1989).  We accord great deference to the district court's determination, reviewing it only for an abuse of discretion.  E.g., United States v. Benavente Gomez, 921 F.2d 378, 384 (1st Cir.1990).  Nevertheless, we will overturn a district court's determination if, upon careful review, we are left with a \"definite and firm conviction that the court made a clear error of judgment\" in its decision to admit the testimony.

See Fed.R.Evid. 803(24);  Polansky v. CNA Ins. Co., 852 F.2d 626, 631 (1st Cir.1988);  cf. 2 Kenneth S. Broun et al., McCormack on Evidence Sec. 324, at 362 (John W. Strong ed., 4th ed. 1992) (equivalent guarantees of trustworthiness is the most important issue).  This trustworthiness inquiry is largely fact driven, and its focus will vary depending on the context in which the issue arises.  See Brookover v. Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hosp., 893 F.2d 411, 420 (1st Cir.1990).  A court, however, may consider whether the evidence shares reliability factors (e.g., personal knowledge, lack of bias) common to the other hearsay exceptions, see 2 McCormack Sec. 324, at 362-4, and whether the evidence, but for a technicality, would otherwise come within a specific exception, see United States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1126-27 (1st Cir.1989) (where insufficient foundation laid to admit financial documents under business records exception, court had discretion to admit them under residual exception), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1005 (1990).  Essentially, the district court must determine whether the totality of the circumstances surrounding the statement establish its reliability sufficiently enough to justify foregoing the rigors of in-court testimony (e.g., live testimony under oath, cross-examination) that ordinarily guarantee trustworthiness.  See Michael H. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure:  Evidence, Sec. 6775, at 737-40 (1992) (courts employ \"ad hoc assessment of reliability based upon the totality of the surrounding circumstances\");  cf. United States v. Ellis, 935 F.2d 385, 394 (1st Cir.)  (citing Idaho v. Wright, 497 U.S. 805, 819, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 3148-49, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990)) (guarantees of trustworthiness in Confrontation Clause context must be established from the \"totality of circumstances\" surrounding the making of the statement), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 869, 112 S.Ct. 201, 116 L.Ed.2d 160 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we believe that the government clearly failed to establish that the EXIS-derived evidence possessed sufficient \"circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness,\" we hold that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence.  As noted above, the district court rested its decision to admit the testimony, at least in part, on its finding that law-enforcement agencies use and rely on the database \"on a regular basis.\"   Though we take no issue with this narrow finding, it is hardly dispositive on the issue of trustworthiness.  That law enforcement authorities rely on information culled from the database does not, a fortiori, imbue that information with sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness to warrant admission under Rule 803(24).  Indeed, law enforcement authorities often rely on information during their investigations (e.g., polygraph examinations, anonymous tips) that would not necessarily be admissible as evidence.  See United States v. Scarborough, 43 F.3d 1021, 1026 (6th Cir.1994) (polygraph examinations generally inadmissible);  and Fed.R.Evid. 801, 802 (prohibiting hearsay evidence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More to the point, the government failed to establish that the reports underlying the database possessed any guarantees of trustworthiness similar to those found in the enumerated hearsay exceptions.  See generally Fed.R.Evid. 803(1)-(23).  Scheid, the government's expert on EXIS, stated that the database derived from reports submitted by a variety of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.  Though Scheid testified extensively on the reliability of the procedures he followed to cull information from the reports and subsequently input it into the EXIS database, the government offered virtually nothing establishing the reliability of the underlying reports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, Scheid, who had been solely responsible for EXIS since 1977, admitted that no agency outside of the ATF was required by law to send reports to the EXIS database and that state and local agencies submitting reports were not required to follow any express procedures or conform to any specific standards in collecting or recording the reported information.  Indeed, it is far from clear the extent to which information memorialized in any of the reports derives from laboratory analyses, on-the-scene observations of police officers, second-hand descriptions of the device by layperson witnesses, or some other source.  Cf. United States v. Scholle, 553 F.2d 1109, 1123-25 (8th Cir.)  (allowing printouts from Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") computer database where database comprised only chemical analyses performed at regional DEA laboratories), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 940, 98 S.Ct. 432, 54 L.Ed.2d 300 (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scheid further testified that the submitted reports need not be signed, and that nothing required the author of a submitted report to have personal knowledge of its contents, see Fed.R.Evid. 803 advisory committee's note (\"In a hearsay situation, the declarant is, of course, a witness, and neither this rule nor Rule 804 dispenses with the requirement of firsthand knowledge.\");   Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) (business record must be recorded by or from information supplied by an individual with personal knowledge), or for that matter to be qualified as a bomb investigator, see Matthews v. Ashland Chem., Inc., 770 F.2d 1303, 1309-10 (5th Cir.1985);  4 Jack B. Weinstein et al., Weinstein's Evidence, p 803(8), at 803-283 (\"Questions of the qualification of the expert can be raised as one of the circumstances indicating lack of trustworthiness.\");   cf. Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey, 488 U.S. 153, 167 n. 11, 109 S.Ct. 439, 449 n. 11, 102 L.Ed.2d 445 (1988) (\"investigator's skill or experience\" is factor establishing trustworthiness of government evaluative report).  Finally, Scheid admitted that he employed no procedures for verifying or updating information in the EXIS database that had been submitted by agencies other than ATF.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The underlying reports, arguably, come closest to falling within the hearsay exception for public records and reports, Fed.R.Evid. 803(8).  In criminal cases, however, Rule 803(8) does not authorize the prosecution's use of investigative reports that contain \"matters observed by police officers and other law enforcement personnel,\" Fed.R.Evid. 803(8)(B), or \"factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to an authority granted by law,\" Fed.R.Evid. 803(8)(C).  See United States v. Arias-Santana, 964 F.2d 1262, 1264 (1st Cir.1992) (police reports offered by prosecution generally inadmissible);  but cf., e.g., United States v. Brown, 9 F.3d 907, 911-12 (11th Cir.1993) (Rule 803(8) does not necessarily prohibit the use of police records prepared in a routine non-adversarial setting that do not result from subjective investigation and evaluation), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 152, 130 L.Ed.2d 91 (1994).  Moreover, the exception provided by Rule 803(8) is further limited by the general qualification proscribing the use of public records if \"the sources of information or other circumstances indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 803(8).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have noted that Congress intended the residual hearsay exception to be used \" 'very rarely, and only in exceptional circumstances.' \"  Benavente Gomez, 921 F.2d at 384 (quoting S.Rep. No. 1277, 93d Cong.2d Sess., 20 (1974), reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7051, 7066);  see also Nivica, 887 F.2d at 1127 (\"Rule 803(24) should be used stintingly\").  Moreover, Congress did not intend for the exception \" 'to establish a broad license for trial judges to admit hearsay statements that do not fall within one of the other exceptions' or 'to authorize major judicial revisions of the hearsay rule.' \"  Benavente Gomez, 921 F.2d at 384 (quoting S.Rep. No. 1277, 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7066.).  In this case, the government failed to establish that the reports composing the EXIS database possessed guarantees of trustworthiness equivalent to the other exceptions to the hearsay rule.  Neither are we convinced that the totality of circumstances surrounding the reports adequately assure their reliability where no standardized procedures were employed in creating the reports and the sources of the reported information are unknown.  Finally, we find it significant that the government points us to no case in which it has successfully (or unsuccessfully) sought to admit EXIS-derived evidence to prove the identity of a bomb maker.  Accordingly, we hold that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the EXIS-derived evidence under the residual exception to the hearsay rule to prove the identity of the builder of the Roslindale bomb.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we agree with Trenkler that the district court erred in admitting the EXIS-derived evidence, we nonetheless find the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  Initially we note that substantial evidence, beyond Trenkler's participation in the Quincy bombing, supported a finding that he had built the Roslindale bomb.  Principally, David Lindholm convincingly testified that, in fact, Trenkler had actually admitted building the Roslindale bomb.  Other admissions by Trenkler made to various law enforcement officers inferentially corroborated Lindholm's testimony, specifically Trenkler's sketch of the Roslindale bomb, drawn shortly after the explosion and conspicuously featuring two electrical blasting caps.  Moreover, Trenkler's arrogant assertion to Agent Leahy that, \"if we did it, then only we know about it ... how will you ever find out ... if neither one of us talk[ ]?\" provided further corroboration.  Additional support could be inferred from the ample evidence the government adduced establishing Trenkler's relationship with Shay Jr. and his knowledge of both electronics and explosives.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the government offered the EXIS-derived evidence to prove that the Roslindale and Quincy bombs were so similar that they evinced the signature of a single bomb maker, thus, establishing the relevance of the Quincy bomb evidence on the issue of identity.  Our review of the record, however, convinces us that the EXIS-derived evidence was not a critical factor in the district court's decision to admit the Quincy bomb evidence for the purpose of proving identity.  The EXIS-derived evidence was merely cumulative, corroborating the testimony of the government's explosives expert who, after testifying in detail about the similarities between the two bombs, stated that he had no doubt \"whatsoever\" that the same person built both bombs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a>  Moreover, as discussed supra at 54-56, other circumstantial evidence tending to show that the maker of each bomb used a similar modus operandi (e.g., both bombs built for a friend, both bomb makers used third party to acquire needed components) independently supported the inference that the same person built both bombs.  Finally, even putting aside whether the jury would have found the two incidents sufficiently similar to prove identity without the EXIS-derived evidence, the jury nonetheless would have been able to consider the fact that Trenkler had designed and built the Quincy bomb to prove Trenkler's knowledge and skill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, while the admission of the EXIS-derived evidence would not have been harmless error if the only other evidence consisted of the expert's testimony of signature and the evidence establishing Trenkler's relationship with Shay Jr. and his electrical and explosive skills, the additional presence of several different strong sources of testimony relating Trenkler's admissions, convinces us that no rational jury could have entertained a reasonable doubt of Trenkler's guilt even in the absence of the EXIS-derived evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Shay Jr.'s Out-of-Court Statements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trenkler additionally asserts that the district court erred by admitting testimony relating ten out-of-court statements purportedly uttered by Shay Jr.  The statements, in general, tended to implicate Shay Jr. in the bombing and to suggest that Shay Jr. had not acted alone.  The district court admitted the statements either as nonhearsay evidence of Shay Jr.'s state of mind, see Fed.R.Evid. 801(c);  2 McCormack Sec. 269 at 208, or as falling within the declaration-against-penal-interest exception to the hearsay rule, see Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3).  Trenkler argues that the admission of these statements violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In asserting a Confrontation Clause violation, Trenkler relies primarily on Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), in which the Supreme Court held that, in a joint trial, an instruction to the jury to disregard the confession of one non-testifying defendant was insufficient to prevent the confession from unfairly prejudicing the other defendant.  Critical to the Bruton Court's decision was the trial court's undisputed ruling that the confession was inadmissible against the non-confessing defendant.  Id. at 128 n. 3, 88 S.Ct. at 1624 n. 3.  Bruton has no application in the present case, however, because the challenged statements here were directly admissible against Trenkler and, consequently, did not pose the Bruton risk of spill-over prejudice.  In this case, the district court admitted the statements against Trenkler to establish the existence of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Confrontation Clause does not proscribe the use of all out-of-court statements.  See Idaho v. Wright, 497 U.S. 805, 813, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 3145, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990).  In general, nonhearsay statements or statements not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted do not raise Confrontation Clause concerns.  Tennessee v. Street, 471 U.S. 409, 414, 105 S.Ct. 2078, 2081-82, 85 L.Ed.2d 425 (1985);  United States v. Levine, 5 F.3d 1100, 1107 (7th Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1224, 127 L.Ed.2d 569 (1994).  Moreover, the Confrontation Clause does not necessarily prohibit the use of hearsay statements where the trial court has admitted them pursuant to a \"firmly-rooted\" exception to the hearsay rule or has otherwise found the statements to possess \"particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\"   See Wright, 497 U.S. at 816, 110 S.Ct. at 3147 (citing Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the district court admitted the statements as nonhearsay evidence, Trenkler's Confrontation Clause challenge lacks merit.  See Street, 471 U.S. at 414, 105 S.Ct. at 2081-82.   As for the rest, we have strongly suggested previously that the exception for declarations against penal interest is a \"firmly rooted\" exception to the hearsay rule.  See United States v. Seeley, 892 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1989) (\"exception for declarations against penal interest would seem to be 'firmly rooted' \").  Trenkler does not challenge this assumption, nor does he explain why the statements in question lack \"particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\"   Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the district court violated Trenkler's confrontation rights by admitting them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Trenkler's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TORRUELLA, Chief Judge, (dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, the erroneous admission in this case of evidence derived from the EXIS computer database violated the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him.  Contrary to my brethren, I do not believe that this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  I therefore dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trenkler admitted to building a device that exploded in Quincy in 1986.  The government's central strategy at trial<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> was to prove that the Quincy device was so similar to the Roslindale bomb that they had to have been built by the same person.  Stephen Scheid, an Intelligence Research Specialist with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (\"ATF\"), testified that he conducted a computer query on the ATF's EXIS database<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> to identify bomb incidents which shared certain characteristics with the Roslindale incident.  Based on this analysis, Scheid told the jury that, out of the 14,252 bombings and attempted bombings reported in EXIS, only the Roslindale and the Quincy incidents shared all the queried characteristics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For a jury reviewing otherwise weak circumstantial evidence of defendant's guilt (see infra ), this is powerful stuff--tangible, \"scientific\" evidence which seems to conclusively establish that the same person who made the Quincy device in 1986 made the Roslindale bomb in 1991.  Unfortunately, as the majority concedes, the reports from which the EXIS information is derived are utterly unreliable, thus rendering its conclusion equally unreliable, and, as will be shown, completely misleading.  For three related reasons, I disagree with the majority's conclusion that admission of the EXIS-derived evidence was \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\"   First, the EXIS-derived evidence plainly influenced the district court's decision to allow the government's motion to admit evidence of the Quincy incident, under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), to show that the same person must have built the Roslindale bomb.  Second, the EXIS-derived evidence was very powerful and very misleading.  Third, the other evidence against Trenkler was not \"overwhelming,\" as is required under our precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority assumes, without deciding, that Trenkler's Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him was violated by introduction of the EXIS-derived evidence.  Supra n. 22.  As the majority recognizes, constitutional cases are governed by a stringent harmless error analysis--a conviction cannot stand unless the effect of the evidence is \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967) (emphasis added);  United States v. de Jesus-Rios, 990 F.2d 672, 678 (1st Cir.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a>  To comprehend why admission of the EXIS-derived evidence was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, one must understand the nature and extent of the constitutional violation.  Because the majority barely acknowledges, much less discusses, the constitutional right at stake in this case, its result appears both analytically sound and benign.  It is neither.  I will therefore begin by explaining why, and to what extent, Trenkler's Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him was violated.  I will then endeavor to show why this error cannot be considered harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment provides that, \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\"   The Supreme Court has explained that \"[t]he central concern of the Confrontation Clause is to ensure the reliability of the evidence against a criminal defendant by subjecting it to rigorous testing in the context of an adversary proceeding before the trier of fact.\"  Maryland v.

Trenkler's attorney was unable to cross-examine these witnesses with respect to their credibility and reliability.  Because they were not subject to cross-examination, neither we nor the jury will ever know, for example, the answers to the following questions.  Were the authors of these reports bomb experts?   Were they even police officers?   Did they follow certain procedures in compiling evidence?   In filing their reports?   What criteria did they use for determining that the device in question was a quote \"bomb\"?   Did they even have first hand knowledge of the devices, or was the information provided to them second-hand from lay witnesses?   Scheid did not know the answers to these questions, nor did he have first hand knowledge of the incidents themselves, supra pp. 58-59, thus making it impossible for Trenkler's attorney to effectively cross-examine him.

The majority notes that the database entry for the Roslindale incident lists approximately twenty-two characteristics describing that incident, but Scheid, inexplicably, chose only to query ten of those characteristics.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a>  Supra n. 21.  The majority notes that there is nothing to suggest that these ten characteristics are more important to a bomb-signature analysis than any of the other characteristics not chosen.  Scheid offers no reason why he chose to query only certain generic characteristics instead of the more specific characteristics of the Roslindale bomb, which would be more evincing of a \"signature.\"   For example, the Quincy device would not have been a match if Scheid had queried any of the following characteristics of the Roslindale bombing:  Futaba antenna, Rockstar detonator, use of dynamite, nails, glue, 6-volt battery, slide switch, paint, magazine page, or black electrical tape.  The majority leaves the implication unspoken. I will not be so discreet.  The obvious implication is that Scheid chose the particular characteristics in an attempt to find a match with the Quincy device.  This implication is enforced by the fact that, according to Scheid's own testimony, the Quincy incident was not entered into the database until after the Roslindale incident.  That is, government agents brought the Quincy bombing to Scheid's attention when they asked him to investigate the Roslindale bombing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority thinks these concerns go more to the weight of the evidence than to its admissibility;  to the contrary, they go directly to the question of whether the evidence has particularized guarantees of trustworthiness under the Confrontation Clause.  They demonstrate that it does not.  Because the reports upon which the EXIS evidence is based are inherently and utterly unreliable, the EXIS evidence itself is inherently and utterly unreliable, and Trenkler's Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him was violated.  See Wright, 497 U.S. at 805, 110 S.Ct. at 3139.   The question then becomes whether this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard, we must vacate the conviction if there is \"some reasonable possibility that error of constitutional dimension influenced the jury in reaching [its] verdict.\"  United States v. Maraj, 947 F.2d 520, 526 n. 8 (1st Cir.1991) (emphasis added) (quoting United States v. Argentine, 814 F.2d 783, 789 (1st Cir.1987)).  See also United States v. Flores, 968 F.2d 1366, 1372 (1st Cir.1992).  Under this standard, we will only find harmless error when the untainted evidence, standing alone, provides \"overwhelming evidence\" of the defendant's guilt.  Clark v. Moran, 942 F.2d 24, 27 (1st Cir.1991).  In conducting this inquiry, we \"must consider the evidence as a whole, weighing the effect of the tainted evidence against the effect of that evidence which was properly admitted.\"  Id. (citing Lacy v. Gardino, 791 F.2d 980, 986 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 888, 107 S.Ct. 284, 93 L.Ed.2d 259 (1986)).  Thus, the relative strength of the tainted evidence--i.e., its potential effect on the jury--is a highly significant consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I see it, there are three related reasons why admission of the EXIS evidence cannot be considered harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  First, it is clear to me that the district court relied on the improper EXIS evidence in its decision to allow the government to present evidence of the Quincy incident to the jury to prove identity under Rule 404(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing on its motion in limine to admit evidence of the Quincy incident under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), the government presented the testimony of Scheid, regarding the EXIS computer analysis, and the testimony of the government's bomb expert, Waskom, who testified that, in his opinion, the Quincy and Roslindale devices were so similar that they must have been built by the same person.  In turn, Trenkler presented expert testimony that the devices were too different for anyone to be able to determine if they were built by the same person.  After hearing this evidence, the district court concluded that \"the similarities [between the two incidents] are sufficient to admit the evidence under the rules established ... by the First Circuit.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority states that, based upon its review of the record, it is convinced that the EXIS-based evidence \"was not a critical factor in the district court's decision to admit the Quincy bomb evidence for purposes of identity.  The EXIS-derived evidence was merely cumulative, corroborating the testimony of the government's explosives expert.\"   Supra pp. 60-61.  Yet the record demonstrates that the district court judge thought otherwise when she decided to admit evidence of the 1986 Quincy incident.  In her oral opinion on the government's motion, the district court judge began by summarizing the testimony of Waskom, and then stated:  \"Adding to this evidence, the statistical evidence from the EXIS system, I am persuaded that the two devices are sufficiently similar to prove that the same person built them, and thus relevant to the issues in this case.\"  (emphasis added).  The district court judge did not say that the EXIS evidence \"corroborated\" Waskom's testimony.  She stated that, when she adds the EXIS evidence to Waskom's testimony, she becomes convinced that the two devices are sufficiently similar.  It is plain that the district court judge relied on the EXIS evidence to form the critical final link between the two devices.  Indeed, in arguing its motion, the government chose to first present the EXIS evidence and then to present the Waskom testimony, suggesting that it intended the latter to corroborate the former.  The district court's erroneous determination that the EXIS evidence was admissible led not only to the jury hearing that evidence, but also to the jury hearing Waskom's testimony with respect to the two incidents.  I cannot agree, therefore, that admission of this evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second reason that admission of the EXIS evidence cannot be considered harmless is that this type of \"scientific\" evidence is too misleading, too powerful, and has too great a potential impact on lay jurors, to be disregarded as harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EXIS-derived evidence was, in the best case scenario, unintentionally misleading, and, in the worst case scenario, deliberately skewed.  Scheid testified that, in entering information about the Quincy incident into the EXIS database, he relied solely on a laboratory report prepared in 1986 by investigators from the Massachusetts Department of Public Safety.  This report does not state that the Quincy device was attached to the underside of the Capeway truck.  Rather, it refers only to an \"[e]xplosion on truck.\"   Somebody must have given Scheid further information about the Quincy explosion because he entered \"under vehicle\" as a characteristic of the Quincy incident.  The majority acknowledges these facts but, inexplicably, makes no comment.  See supra at 50 n. 8.  These facts are important for three reasons.  First, they illustrate the fallibility of the underlying reports.  How many of the other 14,232 reports had similar defects?   Second, they illustrate how easily one wrong or incomplete entry can affect a query result.  If Scheid had actually followed the report, the Quincy incident would not have matched the Roslindale bombing because Scheid's query entry was for a bomb \"under vehicle.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a>  Finally, these facts indicate that the EXIS test was skewed (whether intentionally or unintentionally) to find a match between the Quincy and Roslindale incidents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EXIS-derived evidence is also misleading because it focuses the jury's attention on the trees instead of the forest.  By focusing on similar minor aspects between the two devices--e.g., duct tape, magnets and soldering--the majority completely brushes aside the fact that the central and most important ingredient in the two devices is fundamentally different.  The central ingredient in a bomb, one would think, is the explosive content (in much the same way that the central ingredient in a high-performance car is the engine).  The Roslindale bomb used two to three sticks of dynamite--a very powerful explosive.  The Quincy device used an M-21 Hoffman artillery simulator, which is a device used by the military to simulate, in a safe fashion, the flash and noise of artillery.  The simulator is, in effect, a firecracker-like device;  it has no where near the strength of dynamite.  In stark contrast to dynamite, a simulator is not designed to cause physical or property damage.  Indeed, while the Roslindale device created an explosion large enough to kill, the Quincy device caused no visible damage to the truck it was placed under.  Equating the two devices is like equating a BB gun with a high caliber rifle.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The misleading nature of the EXIS-derived statement is compounded by the nature of its source, and the way in which it was presented to the jury.  Not only is it rank hearsay evidence, it is hearsay evidence wrapped in a shroud of \"scientific\" authenticity.  This is not a paid government expert testifying that, in his opinion, the two devices were built by the same person;  this is a computer declaring that the two devices were built by the same person.  Computers deal in facts,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a> not opinions.  Computers are not paid by one side to testify.  Computers do not have prejudices.  And computers are not subject to cross-examination.  Moreover, the chart of the EXIS queries performed by Scheid, and the printouts of the results of those queries, were introduced into evidence and presented as exhibits to the jury.  Consequently, the jury had this misleading, physical evidence with them in the jury room during deliberations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a>  Does it not stand to reason that the lay juror will accord greater weight to a computer's written findings than to the testimony of a government expert witness?   The common-sense answer is, of course.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority decision in this case not only defies common sense, it is also contrary to our precedent.  In de Jesus-Rios, 990 F.2d 672, we held that the defendant's due process rights were violated when the district court admitted certain identification testimony by a witness.  Significantly, we concluded that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, even though another witness testified at trial that he also had identified the defendant.  Rather than concluding, as the majority does here, that the one erroneously admitted identification was \"merely cumulative\" of the other, the court reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p>[T]here is no way for us to discern the role that Rivera's identification played in the jury's deliberations.  We are concerned that the jury may have been persuaded to convict by the very fact that there were two witnesses who identified [the defendant].  It is also possible that the jury relied solely upon the testimony of Rivera in reaching its conclusion.  Thus, we find reasonable doubt exists as to whether the jury would have convicted [the defendant] based solely upon Mejias's identification testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 678 (emphasis added).  Is it not equally plausible that the jury in this case \"may have been persuaded to convict\" by the very fact that two \"witnesses\"--Waskom and the EXIS-derived evidence--identified the builder of the Quincy device as the builder of the Roslindale bomb?   Is it not also equally plausible that the jury relied solely upon the EXIS-derived evidence in reaching its conclusion?   Because the EXIS-derived statement came from a computer, and was presented in tangible, exhibit form, it is more powerful and seemingly credible evidence to a lay jury than the testimony of a human being.  The jury may well have relied on the EXIS-derived evidence to break the tie between the competing experts.  This is particularly so since, as the trial judge noted, defendant's expert witness had \"considerably more experience in making ... signature comparisons.\"   Since the EXIS-derived evidence could well have been \"the clincher\" for the jury, it cannot be considered harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Coppola v. Powell, 878 F.2d 1562 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third reason that admission of the EXIS evidence is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt is that the other evidence against Trenkler was not \"overwhelming.\"   See Clark, 942 F.2d at 27.   The majority points to a conglomeration of other testimony in support of its conclusion that there was \"substantial evidence\" of Trenkler's guilt, independent of the Quincy incident.  The test, of course, is not whether there is \"substantial evidence\" of Trenkler's guilt but whether there is \"overwhelming evidence\" of Trenkler's guilt.  The two standards are qualitatively and quantitatively different.  In any case, I will begin by addressing Trenkler's \"statements\" to government agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ATF Agent D'Ambrosio testified that he asked Trenkler to draw a sketch of the Quincy device, which Trenkler did.  D'Ambrosio then told Trenkler that the Roslindale bomb also used remote control, but that, rather than a firecracker type device, it used dynamite.  D'Ambrosio asked Trenkler how, in light of these facts, the wiring diagram he had just drawn for the Quincy device would have been different for the Roslindale bomb.  D'Ambrosio testified that Trenkler then drew a diagram which showed two blasting caps inserted into two sticks of dynamite.  The majority considers this significant evidence of Trenkler's guilt because the fact that the Roslindale bomb used blasting caps had not been publicly disclosed.  The majority fails to note, however, that D'Ambrosio actually testified that at least two blasting caps were used in the Roslindale bombing.  Thus, Trenkler's drawing of only two blasting caps was not an exact match.  Moreover, the jury heard evidence that Trenkler had extensive knowledge of both electronics and explosives, so it is not necessarily significant that Trenkler was able to reconstruct an aspect of the Roslindale bomb, particularly considering the information concerning the bomb provided to Trenkler by D'Ambrosio.  Trenkler merely identified that blasting caps were a likely way in which a bomb of this size and power would be constructed.  In the absence of any testimony that the use of blasting caps is unusual or unique (a proposition which is highly unlikely), the jury could only speculate as to the significance of the drawing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also finds significance in ATF Agent Leahy's testimony that Trenkler said to him:  \"If we did it, then only we know about it ... how will you ever find out ... if neither one of us talk[ ]?\"  The majority paints this statement in a confessional light.  This testimony may or may not have been of some circumstantial relevance to the jury (although standing alone, of course, it would not be sufficient to sustain a conviction).  But, upon review, when the court is looking for \"overwhelming evidence of guilt,\" one would think the court would not have to resort to this sort of an ambiguous, taunting statement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a>  Similarly, the court notes that there was evidence that Trenkler and Shay knew each other, and that Trenkler had knowledge of both electronics and explosives.  While the jury might consider this type of circumstantial evidence relevant, it can hardly be said that it does much in the way of providing \"overwhelming evidence\" of defendant's guilt.  Cf. United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 476 (1st Cir.1993) (holding that the erroneous admission of inculpatory grand jury testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt when seven people testified at trial that defendant was engaged in marijuana and cocaine dealing, and drugs and money were found in defendant's constructive possession).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority relies most heavily on the testimony of David Lindholm, who testified that Trenkler confessed to building the Roslindale bomb.  But Lindholm had some serious credibility problems which make his testimony \"shaky,\" to say the least.  Lindholm testified that he met Trenkler while Lindholm was serving a 97-month sentence for conspiracy to distribute marijuana and tax evasion.  He further testified that he was in the marijuana business from approximately 1969 through 1988, and that he did not pay any income taxes during that time.  Lindholm also testified that, in order to secure bank loans to purchase property during that period, he showed several banks false income tax returns.  On the basis of Lindholm's shady past alone, the jury might have completely disregarded his testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But Lindholm also had some less obvious credibility problems.  The circumstances of his meeting Trenkler strike me as a little too coincidental.  On December 17, 1992, after a year and a half incarceration in Texas, Lindholm is brought back to Boston concerning certain unspecified charges related to his conviction.  He is then placed in the orientation unit at the Plymouth House of Correction where he meets Alfred Trenkler, who is being held in connection with the Roslindale bombing.  The two subsequently discover that they have an extraordinary amount in common.  First, they are both from the town of Milton, Massachusetts.  Second, Trenkler attended Thayer Academy and Milton Academy, and Lindholm's father also attended Thayer Academy and Milton Academy.  Third, they both lived for a time--overlapping by one year--on White Lawn Avenue in Milton.  Based on these commonalities, and Lindholm's generosity in sharing his knowledge of the criminal justice system with Trenkler, they form a friendship.  Trenkler then, allegedly, confesses to Lindholm that he built the bomb.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, a reasonable juror might question whether Lindholm was placed in the orientation unit by the government for the purpose of obtaining a confession from Trenkler.  If so, that juror would likely wonder what Lindholm got in return.  Not surprisingly, Lindholm testified that he had no agreements with the government and that he did not receive any promises or inducements for his testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a>  He did testify on cross-examination, however, that he knew, when he provided the information about Trenkler to the government, that the only way his 97-month sentence could be reduced was if he supplied new information to the government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not know how much weight the jury gave Lindholm's testimony, but we do know that, at least on paper--for we did not observe his demeanor at trial--Lindholm had some significant credibility problems.  Consequently, I cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have believed his testimony;  particularly in a case such as this where there is absolutely no physical evidence tying Trenkler to the bombing.  Cf. Coppola, 878 F.2d at 1571 (discounting inculpatory testimony of three jail inmates because it \"raises serious questions of credibility\" and noting the absence of any conclusive physical evidence tying the defendant to the crime).  The only evidence coming near that level of reliability was the improperly admitted EXIS evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent the EXIS-derived evidence, the government's case against Trenkler consists of a smorgasbord of inconclusive circumstantial evidence and an inherently unreliable alleged jailhouse confession.  Faced with this sort of evidence, a reasonable jury would probably look for some sort of tangible evidence upon which to hang its hat.  The EXIS-derived evidence was just that.  Because it was the only ostensibly conclusive evidence tying Trenkler to the crime, it may have been the clincher for the jury.  See Coppola, 878 F.2d at 1571.   It was therefore not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A horrible crime was committed in which one police officer was killed and another seriously injured.  Society rightfully demands that the guilty be apprehended, tried, and punished.  But the distinguishing feature of our legal system is that even those charged with grotesque crimes are guaranteed certain constitutional rights intended to ensure that they receive a fair trial.  Unfortunately, and with all due respect to my brethren, I believe the defendant's right to a fair trial was violated when the government was permitted to introduce the highly prejudicial evidence derived from the EXIS computer database.  Because this error so severely violated defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him, and because the remainder of the evidence against him was not \"overwhelming,\" I dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The June 24, 1993, indictment specifically charged Trenkler and Shay Jr. with conspiracy, 18 U.S.C.

In order to prove knowledge, the government introduced evidence of the petitioner's previous involvement in sales of allegedly stolen television sets.  The Supreme Court rejected the petitioner's contention that, before admitting the evidence, the district court was required to make a preliminary finding that the government had proven that the television sets were in fact stolen.

Id.</p>\n        <p>Though the issue here arises in a slightly different context, we think that Huddleston provides the appropriate framework for our analysis.  Here, the government offered the Quincy bomb evidence for the proper Rule 404(b) purpose of identity.  The relevance of the Quincy bomb on the issue of identity turns, however, on the factual question of whether the Roslindale and the Quincy bombings are sufficiently similar to earmark them as the handiwork of the same individual.  This is analogous to whether the television sets in Huddleston were stolen, and, accordingly, Rule 104(b) sets the framework for admissibility.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Though it is unclear from a close reading of the record just how many of the wires in each bomb employed this connection method, it is apparent that at least some did.  More interestingly, we note that, before learning that both bombs had wires that were joined in this fashion, Trenkler's explosives expert stated that such a method is a \"singularly unique method[ ] of assembly which individual bomb makers are very likely to repeat.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> On the other hand, Trenkler argues that the differences between the two bombs are more significant.

See Huddleston, 485 U.S. at 690, 108 S.Ct. at 1501-02</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> As we explain infra in part II.A., we believe that the district court erred in admitting the EXIS database evidence on the issue of idiosyncratic similarity.  Our review of the record, however, convinces us that the EXIS evidence did not weigh significantly in the court's decision to admit the evidence of the Quincy bomb.  Cf. United States v. Gallo, 20 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir.1994) (abuse of discretion occurs when, inter alia, improper factor is accorded significant weight)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> In ruling on the evidence, the district court stated, inter alia, \"The evidence of the [Quincy] bomb is without question prejudicial in the sense that it will likely harm the defendant.  That is not the test, however, the question is whether it is unfairly prejudicial.  It is not.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> Trenkler also contends that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the Quincy bomb evidence to prove knowledge, skill, and intent.  With respect to the issues of knowledge and skill, we find little merit in Trenkler's argument.  Obviously, the fact that Trenkler had in the past built a remote-control bomb has some relevance on whether he possessed the skill and knowledge necessary to build the Roslindale bomb.  See United States v. Latorre, 922 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 876, 112 S.Ct. 217, 116 L.Ed.2d 175 (1991).  Furthermore, because the evidence was otherwise admissible to show identity, allowing the government to use it to show skill and knowledge, posed no additional risk of unfair prejudice</p>\n        <p>Trenkler's contention with respect to intent stands on firmer ground.  We have some difficulty comprehending (and the government does not clearly articulate) any theory of \"special relevance\" tending to show intent that does not depend heavily on an inference of propensity.  See United States v. Lynn, 856 F.2d 430, 436 (1st Cir.1988) (error to admit evidence on intent where inference depends on propensity).  Nonetheless, because the evidence was properly admitted to show identity, knowledge and skill, any error in its admission to show intent is harmless.  See Benavente Gomez, 921 F.2d at 386 (harmless error if it is \"highly probable\" the error did not contribute to the verdict).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Evid. 803 provides:</p>\n        <p>The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:</p>\n        <p>(24) Other Exceptions</p>\n        <p>A statement not specifically covered by any of the foregoing exceptions but having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, if the court determines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact;  (B) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts;  and (C) the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.  However, a statement may not be admitted under this exception unless the proponent of it makes known to the adverse party sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to meet it, the proponent's intention to offer the statement and the particulars of it, including the name and address of the declarant.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> Even putting aside our concerns about the reliability of the underlying reports, we remain, in general, somewhat troubled by the government's use of the evidence.  The statement that out of more than 14,000 bombing and attempted bombing incidents in the EXIS database only the Roslindale and Quincy incidents share the eight specific queried characteristics (bombings and attempted bombings, attached under car or truck, remote-control, round magnets, duct tape, solder, AA batteries, toggle switches) is a fairly powerful statement, but perhaps a somewhat misleading one</p>\n        <p>First, the statement assumes as a necessary predicate that each of the more than 14,000 EXIS entries definitively states whether or not the explosive device described therein actually possessed those characteristics.  We have some doubt about the validity of such an assumption.  In general, bomb reconstruction strikes us as a rather resource-intensive operation.  We can envision circumstances (e.g., a blast causing little or no injuries or damage, a bomb maker apprehended before reconstruction investigation complete) where the investigation and the resulting report might not be nearly as thorough or complete as in the case of either the Roslindale or the Quincy bombs.  Indeed, during the preliminary hearing both Scheid and Thomas Waskom, the government's explosives expert, acknowledged that the absence of an item, such as magnets or batteries, from a post-blast report meant only that investigators did not recover or identify the item and not that it was not used.</p>\n        <p>Second, without further statistical analysis of the database, we believe the statement that out of more than 14,000 incidents only the Quincy and Roslindale bombs share the eight queried characteristics is potentially incomplete.  For example, by our count, the EXIS database entry for the Roslindale incident lists approximately twenty-two characteristics describing that incident.  Nowhere in the record, however, does the government explain why it chose to focus on the specific characteristics used to query the database.  It does not suggest that these characteristics are more important in a bomb-signature analysis than any of the other characteristics not chosen.  Moreover, the government does not offer any analysis of the significance of the fact that the Roslindale and the Quincy incidents share the queried characteristics.  In other words, though it is true that only the Quincy incident shares the eight queried characteristics with the Roslindale incident, how many other incidents share some other set of eight (or more  than eight) characteristics with the Roslindale incident?</p>\n        <p>Arguably, these concerns go more to the weight of the evidence than to its admissibility.  However, we point them out here to underscore the caution a district court should employ in allowing evidence couched in terms of numerical probabilities.  Cf. United States v. Massey, 594 F.2d 676, 679-81 (8th Cir.1979) (testimony stating probability of match to be one chance in 4,500 unfairly confusing where no foundation for statement provided).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> In general, we review an evidentiary miscue only for harmless error, dismissing it if \"we determine that it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the verdict.\"  Benavente Gomez, 921 F.2d at 386 (internal quotations and citations omitted).  In this case, however, Trenkler also contends that the erroneously admitted evidence deprived him of his confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment, see U.S. Const. amend.  VI (\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\").  Assuming arguendo that the admission of the EXIS-derived evidence rises to the level of constitutional error, we accordingly employ a stricter standard, asking whether we can consider the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  See United States v. Brennan, 994 F.2d 918, 927 (1st Cir.1993);  see also United States v. Argentine, 814 F.2d 783, 788-89 (1st Cir.1987) (constitutional errors may not be regarded as harmless if there is a reasonable possibility that the error influenced the jury in reaching a verdict)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> We note with some concern our dissenting colleague's suggestion that, notwithstanding Lindholm's testimony (elicited by the U.S. Attorney) that the government had not offered or promised Lindholm any consideration for his testimony, an implicit quid pro quo nonetheless existed for his cooperation.

But we differ from his conclusion that it is \"plain\" that the district court relied on the EXIS-derived evidence to form \"the critical final link between the two devices,\" see infra at 66.  Indeed, the court's discussion focuses entirely on the expert testimony, with only the passing reference at the end to the EXIS system.  In this context, we read the district court to be saying not that the EXIS evidence was necessary to its decision, but only that it provided additional support for it</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> We agree with our dissenting brother that we may find an error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt only when the other evidence in the case, \"standing alone, provides 'overwhelming evidence' of the defendant's guilt.\"   See infra at 65 (quoting Clark v. Moran, 942 F.2d 24, 27 (1st Cir.1991)).  In contrast with our colleague, however, we believe that, when the evidence of Trenkler's participation in the Quincy bombing, which we do not believe was rendered inadmissible by the admission of the EXIS-derived evidence, is added to the \"substantial\" other evidence of Trenkler's guilt, the resulting sum is clearly \"overwhelming.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> We do not understand Trenkler to assert that the district court committed error under the Federal Rules of Evidence in admitting the statements.

In short, in the mind of the typical lay juror, a scientific witness has a special aura of credibility.</p>\n        <p>Imwinkelried, Evidence Law and Tactics for the Proponents of Scientific Evidence, In Scientific and Expert Evidence 33, 37 (E.

On appeal, Trenkler challenges the admission of evidence relating to his participation in a prior bombing that occurred five years earlier in Quincy, Massachusetts (\"the Quincy bomb\").  Trenkler also assigns error to two evidentiary rulings admitting evidence derived from a computer database that purported to establish that Trenkler built both the Quincy and the Roslindale bombs and several out-of-court statements made by a fellow participant in the bombing.  After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 28, 1991, a bomb exploded at the Roslindale home of Thomas L. Shay (\"Shay Sr.\"), killing one Boston police officer and severely injuring another.  The two officers, members of the Boston Police Department Bomb Squad, had been dispatched to Shay Sr.'s home to investigate a suspicious object located in Shay Sr.'s driveway.  Shay Sr. had earlier reported that, while backing his 1986 Buick Century into the street the day before, he had heard a loud noise emanating from beneath the floorboard of his automobile.  Shay Sr. added that, subsequently, he found the suspicious object resting near the crest of his driveway.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the explosion, a massive investigation ensued involving a variety of federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies.  On June 24, 1993, this investigation culminated with the return of a three-count indictment charging Trenkler and Thomas A. Shay (\"Shay Jr.\"), Shay Sr.'s son, with responsibility for the Roslindale bombing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Trenkler filed a successful severance motion, and the government tried the two defendants separately.  Shay Jr. was tried first, and a jury convicted him on counts of conspiracy and malicious destruction of property by means of explosives.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Trenkler's trial, the thrust of the government's case was that Trenkler had built the Roslindale bomb for Shay Jr. to use against his father.  To establish Trenkler's identity as the builder of the bomb, the government offered, inter alia, evidence that Trenkler had previously constructed a remote-control device, the Quincy bomb, which exploded in Quincy, Massachusetts, in 1986.  The government contended that unique similarities in design, choice of components, and overall modus operandi between the two bombs compelled the conclusion that Trenkler had designed and built both devices.  Prior to trial, the government filed a motion in limine seeking to admit the \"similarity\" evidence.  Following a day-long evidentiary hearing, the district court ruled the evidence admissible, finding that it was relevant on the issues of identity, skill, knowledge, and intent.  Although Trenkler did not testify at trial, his counsel stipulated at the evidentiary hearing that Trenkler had built the Quincy bomb.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1986 Quincy Bomb</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trenkler constructed the Quincy bomb in 1986 for a friend, Donna Shea.  At the time, Shea was involved in a dispute with the owners of the Capeway Fish Market and she wanted the bomb to use as a means to intimidate them.  At her request, Trenkler assembled a remote-control, radio-activated explosive device.  The device was later attached to the undercarriage of a truck belonging to the Capeway Fish Market and detonated in the middle of the night.  The resulting bomb blast caused no injuries and little property damage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In building the Quincy bomb, Trenkler used as the explosive material a military flash simulator typically utilized to mimic gunfire in combat exercises.  To provide remote-control capabilities, Trenkler employed a radio-receiver he had removed from a small toy car.  Trenkler wrapped the bomb in duct tape and attached a large donut-shaped speaker magnet to enable the bomb to adhere to the undercarriage of the truck.  Other components Trenkler used included a \"double throw\" toggle switch, four AA batteries, two six-volt batteries, an electric relay, solder, various wires, and a slide switch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testimony at trial established that Trenkler purchased some of the electrical components for the Quincy bomb from a Radio Shack store.  On one occasion, Trenkler sought to obtain needed components by sending Shea's eleven-year-old nephew into a Radio Shack store with a list of items to purchase while Trenkler remained waiting outside.  Shea's nephew, however, was unable to find all of the items, and Trenkler eventually came into the store to assist him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1991 Roslindale Bomb</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contended that Trenkler built the Roslindale bomb at Shay Jr.'s request. At trial, the government offered evidence about Trenkler's relationship with Shay Jr., dating back at least two years prior to the Roslindale bombing.  Several witnesses, including Trenkler's business partner, reported seeing the two together on different occasions in 1990 and 1991.  Shay Jr.'s address book included an entry for Trenkler listing his current pager number.  Moreover, Trenkler's roommate at the time of the Roslindale bombing testified that, during September and October of 1991, Shay Jr. left several voice-mail messages on the pager for Trenkler.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testimony from government investigators and Shay Sr. established that the Roslindale bomb was a remote-control, radio-activated device with an explosive force supplied by two or three sticks of dynamite connected to two electrical blasting caps.  A black wooden box weighing two or three pounds and measuring approximately eight- to ten-inches long, five- to six-inches wide and one- to two-inches deep housed the bomb.  A large donut-shaped magnet and several smaller round magnets attached to the box were used to secure the device to the underside of Shay Sr.'s automobile.  Other components used in the construction of the bomb included duct tape, a \"single throw\" toggle switch, four AA batteries, five nine-volt batteries, a Futaba radio receiver, solder, various wires, and a slide switch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the government's experts and Shay Sr., the bomb was originally attached to the undercarriage of Shay Sr.'s automobile directly beneath the driver's seat.  The government's explosives expert testified that if the bomb had exploded while still attached to the car, it probably would have killed or at least seriously injured any individual sitting in the driver's seat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also asserted that Trenkler used Shay Jr. to purchase the electronic components used in the bomb.  In support of this assertion, the government introduced a sales receipt for a toggle switch purchased in October 1991 at a Radio Shack store located across the street from where Trenkler, at the time, was installing a satellite dish.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (\"ATF\") recovered from the debris of the Roslindale bomb a switch identical to the one purchased.  Shay Jr. admitted purchasing the switch during a taped television interview, portions of which the government introduced at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Furthermore, a sales clerk at the Radio Shack testified that, prior to purchasing the switch, the person who bought it had browsed in the store for several minutes, appearing to shop for items written on a list.  The sales clerk also testified that he recalled seeing Trenkler in the store on two or three occasions during the fall of 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the government and Trenkler elicited testimony from their respective explosives experts explaining the similarities and differences between the two bombs.  Both experts testified at length concerning the electronic designs, the choice of components and the method of construction.  The government's expert opined that the two incidents shared many similar traits and characteristics, evincing the \"signature\" of a single bomb maker.  He further stated that he had no doubt \"whatsoever\" that the same person built both bombs.  Trenkler's expert, on the other hand, stated that too many dissimilarities existed to conclude that the same person built both bombs.  Moreover, Trenkler's expert testified that the similarities that existed lacked sufficient distinguishing qualities to identify the two bombs as the handiwork of a specific individual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>EXIS Computer Database Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support the inference that Trenkler built both bombs, the government offered testimony both at the pretrial hearing and at trial concerning information retrieved from an ATF computer database of explosives and arson incidents.  Stephen Scheid, an Intelligence Research Specialist with ATF, testified that the database, known as EXIS, contains information taken from reports submitted to ATF by various federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies.  Scheid further testified that he had been personally responsible for maintaining the database since 1977.  Scheid stated that he reviews submitted incident reports, culling from them information describing the characteristics of each bombing or arson episode.  Scheid added that he then encodes the extracted information on a standardized worksheet, which he or a data-entry person in turn uses to enter the information into the database.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scheid testified that, through the use of a computer program, he then produces investigatory leads by retrieving all incidents entered in the database that are listed as possessing a specific component or characteristic.  Scheid further testified that, in an effort to identify the builder of the Roslindale bomb, he performed a series of computer queries, focusing on characteristics of the Roslindale bomb.  This series of inquiries narrowed the field of reported incidents in the database from 40,867 to seven.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The seven remaining incidents included both the Roslindale and Quincy bombs.  Scheid stated that he subsequently conducted a manual analysis of the remaining incidents and was able to identify several additional characteristics common to only the Roslindale and Quincy bombs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scheid also testified that the report of the Quincy bomb did not come to his attention through normal procedures.  Scheid did not receive information about the 1986 Quincy bomb, nor enter any information pertaining to it into the EXIS database, until after the Roslindale incident in 1991.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Other Trial Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also offered the testimony of David Lindholm to establish that Trenkler had built the Roslindale bomb.  Lindholm testified that he met Trenkler at the Plymouth House of Correction where they had spent four days incarcerated together in an uncomfortable orientation holding cell in December 1992.  Lindholm testified that initially the cell had held about forty-four prisoners, but that eventually the total number of prisoners in the cell dwindled to six or seven.  Lindholm added that he had numerous conversations with Trenkler over the course of the four days as they gradually \"bonded\" upon discovering that they came from the same home town and had similar backgrounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lindholm testified that he gave Trenkler legal advice based on his own experience as a criminal defendant.  Lindholm acknowledged that Trenkler initially asserted his innocence and had maintained that he could not understand why Shay Jr. had implicated him in the case.  Lindholm testified further that Trenkler later told him that the government knew that some of the components used in the Roslindale bomb had been purchased locally and that, in response, Lindholm opined that the bomber had been careless not to have gone out of state.  To this, Trenkler agreed and then stated that the local purchase was \"regrettable.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Lindholm recalled that at one point during the four days they discussed Trenkler's involvement with the 1986 Quincy bomb.  Lindholm testified that, during this discussion, Trenkler asserted that the Roslindale bomb was much more powerful than the bomb he had built in 1986.  Ultimately, Lindholm stated that Trenkler admitted building the Roslindale bomb, testifying that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>[Lindholm:]  At one point he stated, [\"W]ell, even if I did build a bomb, I did not place it on the car.[\"]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>[Government:]  What happened next?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>[Lindholm:]  Then he paused for a moment and said, [\"S]o, I built the bomb.  I built the bomb.  I don't deserve to die or spend the rest of my life in prison for building this device.[\"]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lindholm added further that Trenkler \"stated that the two bomb squad officers were foolish and negligent for not wearing body armor at the time that they were examining this device, and in essence that it served them right for what happened to them.  It wasn't his fault.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of trial, Lindholm was serving sentences stemming from convictions on federal drug and tax evasion charges.  Lindholm testified that he had not received nor discussed receiving anything from the government in return for his testimony.  On cross examination, Trenkler's counsel made only a minimal effort to impeach Lindholm, raising matters unrelated to his testimony implicating Trenkler.  Primarily Trenkler's counsel attempted to challenge Lindholm's assertion that, as a small boy, he had at one time lived on the same street as Trenkler and to show that Lindholm was at the Plymouth House of Correction in December 1992 in order to provide information to the government on other individuals with whom he had been involved in past criminal activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to Lindholm's testimony, ATF Agents Dennis Leahy and Thomas D'Ambrosio recounted a November 6, 1991, interview they conducted with Trenkler shortly after the bombing.  During this interview, Trenkler admitted building the Quincy bomb and sketched a circuit diagram describing it.  After making the sketch, Agent D'Ambrosio asked Trenkler how the diagram would differ if Trenkler had used dynamite like that utilized in the Roslindale incident.  Both agents testified that, in response to this question, Trenkler drew a second diagram, which featured two sticks of dynamite connected to two electrical blasting caps.  Both agents added that they were surprised when they saw the diagram because the use of two electrical blasting caps was a distinctive feature of the Roslindale bomb that, at the time of the interview, had not been disclosed to the public.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  At trial, Leahy also related other conversations he had with Trenkler in which Trenkler conveyed a working knowledge of dynamite and electrical blasting caps.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leahy further testified about a statement Trenkler made to him at the ATF offices on February 4, 1992.  Leahy explained that Trenkler had come to the offices on his own accord to pick up previously-seized business records.  Leahy stated that, during his visit, Trenkler engaged Leahy in a long discussion, lasting more than two hours, about the course of the investigation.  According to Leahy's testimony, after Leahy had ended the discussion, Trenkler announced arrogantly upon leaving the ATF offices that \"If we did it, then only we know about it.  How will you ever find out ... if neither one of us talk[ ]?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts of the indictment.  Subsequently, the district court sentenced Trenkler to concurrent terms of life imprisonment on the counts of receipt of explosive materials and attempted malicious destruction of property by means of explosives and sixty months on the count of conspiracy.  Trenkler now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Trenkler assigns error to the admission of the Quincy bomb evidence, contending primarily that the incident was not sufficiently similar to the Roslindale bomb to be relevant on the issue of identity, and to the admission of the EXIS database-derived evidence that the government used to prove the similarity of the two bombs.  Trenkler additionally argues that the district court erroneously admitted several out-of-court statements made by Shay Jr.  We discuss each argument in turn.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Quincy Bombing Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with Trenkler's contention that the district court erred in admitting the evidence of the Quincy bombing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Fed.R.Evid. 404(b):  Other Act Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, Rule 404(b)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> proscribes the use of other bad-act evidence solely to establish that the defendant has a propensity towards criminal behavior.  Rule 404(b)'s proscription, however, is not absolute:  the rule permits the use of such evidence if it bears on a material issue such as motive, knowledge or identity.  In this Circuit, we have adopted a two-part test for determining the admissibility of Rule 404(b) evidence.  E.g., United States v. Williams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600261\"><a href=\"/opinion/600261/united-states-v-olgivie-obrien-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">634</span></a></span>, 637 (1st Cir.1993).  First, the district court must determine whether the evidence has some \"special relevance\" independent of its tendency simply to show criminal propensity.  E.g., United States v. Guyon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195450\"><a href=\"/opinion/195450/united-states-v-guyon/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">723</span></a></span>, 728 (1st Cir.1994).  Second, if the evidence has \"special relevance\" on a material issue, the court must then carefully conduct a Rule 403<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> analysis to determine if the probative value of the evidence is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600261\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Williams,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/600261/united-states-v-olgivie-obrien-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span>.   As with most evidentiary rulings, the district court has considerable leeway in determining whether to admit or exclude Rule 404(b) evidence.  Accordingly, we review its decision only under the lens of abuse of discretion.  Id.;  see also United States v. Fields, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520578\"><a href=\"/opinion/520578/united-states-v-michael-j-fields-united-states-of-america-v-james-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span>, 196 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Identity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government offered the evidence of the Quincy bomb, which Trenkler admitted building, primarily to prove that Trenkler also built the Roslindale bomb.  The government contends that the evidence of the Quincy bomb has \"special relevance\" on the issue of identity because the numerous similarities surrounding the Quincy and Roslindale incidents compel the conclusion that the same individual built both bombs.  Trenkler, on the other hand, argues that the Quincy incident is too dissimilar to be relevant on the issue of identity, and even if it has some relevance, the risk of unfair prejudice that it poses far outweighs its probative value.  We agree with the government that the Quincy bomb evidence has \"special relevance\" on the issue of identity and that the district court did not abuse its considerable discretion in admitting it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>a.

In other words, the prior act has no tendency to prove the perpetrator's identity--i.e., it is not relevant--unless the proponent can first establish the conditional fact:  that the two acts are sufficiently idiosyncratic to support the inference that they are the handiwork of the same individual.

In this case, we think the balance of the evidence tilts sufficiently towards admission to satisfy the first step of the Rule 404(b) analysis.  Accordingly, we believe that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the numerous similarities in components, design, and technique of assembly, combined with the similar modus operandi and the closeness of geographic proximity between the two events, sufficiently support the inference that the same person built both bombs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that the government's explosives expert, Thomas Waskom, testified that his analysis of the similarities shared by the two incidents left him with no doubt \"whatsoever\" that the same individual built both bombs.  Our own review of the record reveals that the two bombs did indeed share a number of similar components and characteristics.  Both bombs were remote-controlled, radio-activated, electronic explosive devices.  Both were homemade mechanisms, comprising, in general, electronic components easily purchased at a hobby store.  Both had similar, though not identical, firing and fusing circuits with separate battery power supplies for each.  Both had switches in their fusing circuits to disconnect the radio receivers.  To energize their respective radio receivers, both devices utilized similar power supplies, consisting of four AA batteries.  Both employed many similar components such as batteries, duct tape, toggle switches, radio receivers, antennas, solder, electrical tape, and large round speaker magnets.  Moreover, both used a distinctive method (i.e., twisting, soldering, and taping) to connect some, though not all, of the wires used.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Though we hardly find any of these factors by themselves to be \"highly distinctive,\" the coalescence of them is fairly persuasive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Indeed, even Trenkler's expert witness, Denny Kline, testified at the pretrial hearing that, in light of these similarities, \"there is a possibility, a probability, that maybe there is a connection between the maker of these two bombs.\"  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we note that, in refusing to conclude \"beyond a reasonable doubt\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> that the same person built both bombs, Trenkler's expert Kline eschewed reliance on any factors except the physical evidence.  The appropriate test for sufficient similarity, however, is not so limited.  \"[I]n assessing the sufficiency of the evidence under Rule 104(b), the trial court must consider all evidence presented to the jury.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112049\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Huddleston,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112049/huddleston-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span>-91, 108 S.Ct. at 1502 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we believe some significance is properly attributed to the simple fact that both incidents are bombings.  A bombing, in and of itself, is, arguably, a fairly distinctive method for intimidating or killing an individual.  Cf. United States v.

Trenkler built the Quincy bomb for Donna Shea to use to intimidate the owners of the Capeway Fish Market, and the evidence supported the inference that the person who constructed the Roslindale bomb built it for Shay Jr. to use against his father.  Furthermore, in both instances the builder attempted to conceal his or her participation by using a third party to purchase the electronic components used in the explosive device.  In 1986, Trenkler initially waited in his car while sending Donna Shea's nephew into the electronics store with a list to purchase the needed components.  Similarly, the evidence supports the inference that the builder of the Roslindale bomb used Shay Jr. to purchase the needed components.  Finally, the fact that both bombings occurred within a relatively close geographic proximity must be given some weight in the analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v.

On the other hand, Trenkler offered a fairly impressive list of differences between the two incidents.  In the absence of one or more highly distinctive factors that in themselves point to idiosyncracy, we must examine the combination of all the factors.  Had Trenkler been unable to point to any significant differences, we suspect he would have had little chance in establishing an abuse of discretion in allowing the evidence.  Similarly, had the government found but three or four common characteristics to establish sufficient similarity, we doubt that the admission of the evidence would have been granted or sustained.  Here, in the middle, with substantial evidence on either side and conflicting expert opinions, could a reasonable jury have found it more likely than not that the same person was responsible for both bombs?   We think the answer is yes.

First, the evidence was important to the government's case.  The evidence that Trenkler had built the Quincy bomb corroborated David Lindholm's testimony, identifying Trenkler as the builder of the Roslindale bomb.  Second, although the evidence of similarity could have been more compelling, it was nonetheless substantial:  Indeed, the government's explosives expert testified that he had no doubt \"whatsoever\" that the same person designed and constructed both bombs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, we disagree with the district court that the evidence did not pose any risk of unfair prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  As with all \"bad act\" evidence, there is always some danger that the jury will use the evidence not on the narrow point for which it is offered but rather to infer that the defendant has a propensity towards criminal behavior.  Nonetheless, outside the context of propensity, the evidence was not unduly inflammatory.  The Quincy bomb did not kill or injure any individual and caused little property damage.  Moreover, the district court minimized any risk of unfair prejudice by carefully instructing the jury not to use the evidence of the Quincy bombing to infer Trenkler's guilt simply because he was a bad person or because the fact he had a built a bomb in the past made it more likely he had built the bomb in this case.  In sum, we believe that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the probative value of the Quincy bomb evidence was not substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>B.

Specifically, the government offered it as an affirmative assertion that, out of more than 14,000 bombing and attempted bombing incidents, only the Roslindale and the Quincy incidents possessed in common all of the queried characteristics.  The district court admitted the EXIS-derived testimony under the residual hearsay exception, finding that it was \"sufficiently reliable.\"   In reaching this conclusion, the court noted that the EXIS database was used and relied upon \"by law enforcement authorities on a regular basis.\"   The government asserts that the district court did not err in admitting the testimony because, in general, the underlying reports were \"written objective reports\" summarizing careful field and laboratory investigations that the court could permissibly find to be particularly worthy of belief such that \"adversarial testing ... would add little to [their] reliability.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, it is evident that whether or not particular evidence may be admitted under the residual hearsay exception is a fact-specific inquiry committed in the first instance to the sound discretion of the district court.

This trustworthiness inquiry is largely fact driven, and its focus will vary depending on the context in which the issue arises.  See Brookover v.

As noted above, the district court rested its decision to admit the testimony, at least in part, on its finding that law-enforcement agencies use and rely on the database \"on a regular basis.\"   Though we take no issue with this narrow finding, it is hardly dispositive on the issue of trustworthiness.  That law enforcement authorities rely on information culled from the database does not, a fortiori, imbue that information with sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness to warrant admission under Rule 803(24).  Indeed, law enforcement authorities often rely on information during their investigations (e.g., polygraph examinations, anonymous tips) that would not necessarily be admissible as evidence.  See United States v. Scarborough, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"685621\"><a href=\"/opinion/685621/united-states-v-scott-scarborough/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1021</span></a></span>, 1026 (6th Cir.1994) (polygraph examinations generally inadmissible);  and Fed.R.Evid. 801, 802 (prohibiting hearsay evidence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More to the point, the government failed to establish that the reports underlying the database possessed any guarantees of trustworthiness similar to those found in the enumerated hearsay exceptions.  See generally Fed.R.Evid. 803(1)-(23).  Scheid, the government's expert on EXIS, stated that the database derived from reports submitted by a variety of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.  Though Scheid testified extensively on the reliability of the procedures he followed to cull information from the reports and subsequently input it into the EXIS database, the government offered virtually nothing establishing the reliability of the underlying reports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, Scheid, who had been solely responsible for EXIS since 1977, admitted that no agency outside of the ATF was required by law to send reports to the EXIS database and that state and local agencies submitting reports were not required to follow any express procedures or conform to any specific standards in collecting or recording the reported information.  Indeed, it is far from clear the extent to which information memorialized in any of the reports derives from laboratory analyses, on-the-scene observations of police officers, second-hand descriptions of the device by layperson witnesses, or some other source.

No. 1277, 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7066.).  In this case, the government failed to establish that the reports composing the EXIS database possessed guarantees of trustworthiness equivalent to the other exceptions to the hearsay rule.  Neither are we convinced that the totality of circumstances surrounding the reports adequately assure their reliability where no standardized procedures were employed in creating the reports and the sources of the reported information are unknown.  Finally, we find it significant that the government points us to no case in which it has successfully (or unsuccessfully) sought to admit EXIS-derived evidence to prove the identity of a bomb maker.  Accordingly, we hold that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the EXIS-derived evidence under the residual exception to the hearsay rule to prove the identity of the builder of the Roslindale bomb.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we agree with Trenkler that the district court erred in admitting the EXIS-derived evidence, we nonetheless find the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  Initially we note that substantial evidence, beyond Trenkler's participation in the Quincy bombing, supported a finding that he had built the Roslindale bomb.  Principally, David Lindholm convincingly testified that, in fact, Trenkler had actually admitted building the Roslindale bomb.  Other admissions by Trenkler made to various law enforcement officers inferentially corroborated Lindholm's testimony, specifically Trenkler's sketch of the Roslindale bomb, drawn shortly after the explosion and conspicuously featuring two electrical blasting caps.  Moreover, Trenkler's arrogant assertion to Agent Leahy that, \"if we did it, then only we know about it ... how will you ever find out ... if neither one of us talk[ ]?\" provided further corroboration.  Additional support could be inferred from the ample evidence the government adduced establishing Trenkler's relationship with Shay Jr. and his knowledge of both electronics and explosives.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the government offered the EXIS-derived evidence to prove that the Roslindale and Quincy bombs were so similar that they evinced the signature of a single bomb maker, thus, establishing the relevance of the Quincy bomb evidence on the issue of identity.  Our review of the record, however, convinces us that the EXIS-derived evidence was not a critical factor in the district court's decision to admit the Quincy bomb evidence for the purpose of proving identity.  The EXIS-derived evidence was merely cumulative, corroborating the testimony of the government's explosives expert who, after testifying in detail about the similarities between the two bombs, stated that he had no doubt \"whatsoever\" that the same person built both bombs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a>  Moreover, as discussed supra at 54-56, other circumstantial evidence tending to show that the maker of each bomb used a similar modus operandi (e.g., both bombs built for a friend, both bomb makers used third party to acquire needed components) independently supported the inference that the same person built both bombs.  Finally, even putting aside whether the jury would have found the two incidents sufficiently similar to prove identity without the EXIS-derived evidence, the jury nonetheless would have been able to consider the fact that Trenkler had designed and built the Quincy bomb to prove Trenkler's knowledge and skill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, while the admission of the EXIS-derived evidence would not have been harmless error if the only other evidence consisted of the expert's testimony of signature and the evidence establishing Trenkler's relationship with Shay Jr. and his electrical and explosive skills, the additional presence of several different strong sources of testimony relating Trenkler's admissions, convinces us that no rational jury could have entertained a reasonable doubt of Trenkler's guilt even in the absence of the EXIS-derived evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.

The district court admitted the statements either as nonhearsay evidence of Shay Jr.'s state of mind, see Fed.R.Evid. 801(c);  2 McCormack Sec. 269 at 208, or as falling within the declaration-against-penal-interest exception to the hearsay rule, see Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3).  Trenkler argues that the admission of these statements violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In asserting a Confrontation Clause violation, Trenkler relies primarily on Bruton v.

The government's central strategy at trial<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> was to prove that the Quincy device was so similar to the Roslindale bomb that they had to have been built by the same person.  Stephen Scheid, an Intelligence Research Specialist with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (\"ATF\"), testified that he conducted a computer query on the ATF's EXIS database<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> to identify bomb incidents which shared certain characteristics with the Roslindale incident.  Based on this analysis, Scheid told the jury that, out of the 14,252 bombings and attempted bombings reported in EXIS, only the Roslindale and the Quincy incidents shared all the queried characteristics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For a jury reviewing otherwise weak circumstantial evidence of defendant's guilt (see infra ), this is powerful stuff--tangible, \"scientific\" evidence which seems to conclusively establish that the same person who made the Quincy device in 1986 made the Roslindale bomb in 1991.  Unfortunately, as the majority concedes, the reports from which the EXIS information is derived are utterly unreliable, thus rendering its conclusion equally unreliable, and, as will be shown, completely misleading.  For three related reasons, I disagree with the majority's conclusion that admission of the EXIS-derived evidence was \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\"   First, the EXIS-derived evidence plainly influenced the district court's decision to allow the government's motion to admit evidence of the Quincy incident, under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), to show that the same person must have built the Roslindale bomb.  Second, the EXIS-derived evidence was very powerful and very misleading.  Third, the other evidence against Trenkler was not \"overwhelming,\" as is required under our precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority assumes, without deciding, that Trenkler's Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him was violated by introduction of the EXIS-derived evidence.

The individuals who reported those bomb incidents were witnesses against Trenkler, each of them testifying, in effect:  \"This bomb incident had the following characteristics....\"  Despite the importance of their \"testimony,\" neither Trenkler nor the jury ever saw any of these witnesses.  Trenkler's attorney was unable to cross-examine these witnesses with respect to their credibility and reliability.  Because they were not subject to cross-examination, neither we nor the jury will ever know, for example, the answers to the following questions.  Were the authors of these reports bomb experts?   Were they even police officers?   Did they follow certain procedures in compiling evidence?   In filing their reports?   What criteria did they use for determining that the device in question was a quote \"bomb\"?   Did they even have first hand knowledge of the devices, or was the information provided to them second-hand from lay witnesses?   Scheid did not know the answers to these questions, nor did he have first hand knowledge of the incidents themselves, supra pp. 58-59, thus making it impossible for Trenkler's attorney to effectively cross-examine him.  Moreover, Scheid admitted that the bomb reports need not be signed, and that nothing required the author of a submitted report to have personal knowledge of its contents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also alludes to a potentially more pernicious problem concerning the EXIS-derived evidence.  The majority notes that the database entry for the Roslindale incident lists approximately twenty-two characteristics describing that incident, but Scheid, inexplicably, chose only to query ten of those characteristics.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a>  Supra n. 21.  The majority notes that there is nothing to suggest that these ten characteristics are more important to a bomb-signature analysis than any of the other characteristics not chosen.  Scheid offers no reason why he chose to query only certain generic characteristics instead of the more specific characteristics of the Roslindale bomb, which would be more evincing of a \"signature.\"   For example, the Quincy device would not have been a match if Scheid had queried any of the following characteristics of the Roslindale bombing:  Futaba antenna, Rockstar detonator, use of dynamite, nails, glue, 6-volt battery, slide switch, paint, magazine page, or black electrical tape.  The majority leaves the implication unspoken. I will not be so discreet.  The obvious implication is that Scheid chose the particular characteristics in an attempt to find a match with the Quincy device.  This implication is enforced by the fact that, according to Scheid's own testimony, the Quincy incident was not entered into the database until after the Roslindale incident.  That is, government agents brought the Quincy bombing to Scheid's attention when they asked him to investigate the Roslindale bombing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority thinks these concerns go more to the weight of the evidence than to its admissibility;  to the contrary, they go directly to the question of whether the evidence has particularized guarantees of trustworthiness under the Confrontation Clause.  They demonstrate that it does not.  Because the reports upon which the EXIS evidence is based are inherently and utterly unreliable, the EXIS evidence itself is inherently and utterly unreliable, and Trenkler's Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him was violated.

Thus, the relative strength of the tainted evidence--i.e., its potential effect on the jury--is a highly significant consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I see it, there are three related reasons why admission of the EXIS evidence cannot be considered harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  First, it is clear to me that the district court relied on the improper EXIS evidence in its decision to allow the government to present evidence of the Quincy incident to the jury to prove identity under Rule 404(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing on its motion in limine to admit evidence of the Quincy incident under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), the government presented the testimony of Scheid, regarding the EXIS computer analysis, and the testimony of the government's bomb expert, Waskom, who testified that, in his opinion, the Quincy and Roslindale devices were so similar that they must have been built by the same person.  In turn, Trenkler presented expert testimony that the devices were too different for anyone to be able to determine if they were built by the same person.  After hearing this evidence, the district court concluded that \"the similarities [between the two incidents] are sufficient to admit the evidence under the rules established ... by the First Circuit.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority states that, based upon its review of the record, it is convinced that the EXIS-based evidence \"was not a critical factor in the district court's decision to admit the Quincy bomb evidence for purposes of identity.  The EXIS-derived evidence was merely cumulative, corroborating the testimony of the government's explosives expert.\"   Supra pp. 60-61.  Yet the record demonstrates that the district court judge thought otherwise when she decided to admit evidence of the 1986 Quincy incident.  In her oral opinion on the government's motion, the district court judge began by summarizing the testimony of Waskom, and then stated:  \"Adding to this evidence, the statistical evidence from the EXIS system, I am persuaded that the two devices are sufficiently similar to prove that the same person built them, and thus relevant to the issues in this case.\"  (emphasis added).  The district court judge did not say that the EXIS evidence \"corroborated\" Waskom's testimony.  She stated that, when she adds the EXIS evidence to Waskom's testimony, she becomes convinced that the two devices are sufficiently similar.  It is plain that the district court judge relied on the EXIS evidence to form the critical final link between the two devices.  Indeed, in arguing its motion, the government chose to first present the EXIS evidence and then to present the Waskom testimony, suggesting that it intended the latter to corroborate the former.  The district court's erroneous determination that the EXIS evidence was admissible led not only to the jury hearing that evidence, but also to the jury hearing Waskom's testimony with respect to the two incidents.  I cannot agree, therefore, that admission of this evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second reason that admission of the EXIS evidence cannot be considered harmless is that this type of \"scientific\" evidence is too misleading, too powerful, and has too great a potential impact on lay jurors, to be disregarded as harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EXIS-derived evidence was, in the best case scenario, unintentionally misleading, and, in the worst case scenario, deliberately skewed.  Scheid testified that, in entering information about the Quincy incident into the EXIS database, he relied solely on a laboratory report prepared in 1986 by investigators from the Massachusetts Department of Public Safety.  This report does not state that the Quincy device was attached to the underside of the Capeway truck.  Rather, it refers only to an \"[e]xplosion on truck.\"   Somebody must have given Scheid further information about the Quincy explosion because he entered \"under vehicle\" as a characteristic of the Quincy incident.  The majority acknowledges these facts but, inexplicably, makes no comment.  See supra at 50 n. 8.  These facts are important for three reasons.  First, they illustrate the fallibility of the underlying reports.  How many of the other 14,232 reports had similar defects?   Second, they illustrate how easily one wrong or incomplete entry can affect a query result.  If Scheid had actually followed the report, the Quincy incident would not have matched the Roslindale bombing because Scheid's query entry was for a bomb \"under vehicle.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a>  Finally, these facts indicate that the EXIS test was skewed (whether intentionally or unintentionally) to find a match between the Quincy and Roslindale incidents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EXIS-derived evidence is also misleading because it focuses the jury's attention on the trees instead of the forest.  By focusing on similar minor aspects between the two devices--e.g., duct tape, magnets and soldering--the majority completely brushes aside the fact that the central and most important ingredient in the two devices is fundamentally different.  The central ingredient in a bomb, one would think, is the explosive content (in much the same way that the central ingredient in a high-performance car is the engine).  The Roslindale bomb used two to three sticks of dynamite--a very powerful explosive.  The Quincy device used an M-21 Hoffman artillery simulator, which is a device used by the military to simulate, in a safe fashion, the flash and noise of artillery.  The simulator is, in effect, a firecracker-like device;  it has no where near the strength of dynamite.  In stark contrast to dynamite, a simulator is not designed to cause physical or property damage.  Indeed, while the Roslindale device created an explosion large enough to kill, the Quincy device caused no visible damage to the truck it was placed under.  Equating the two devices is like equating a BB gun with a high caliber rifle.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The misleading nature of the EXIS-derived statement is compounded by the nature of its source, and the way in which it was presented to the jury.  Not only is it rank hearsay evidence, it is hearsay evidence wrapped in a shroud of \"scientific\" authenticity.  This is not a paid government expert testifying that, in his opinion, the two devices were built by the same person;  this is a computer declaring that the two devices were built by the same person.  Computers deal in facts,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a> not opinions.  Computers are not paid by one side to testify.  Computers do not have prejudices.  And computers are not subject to cross-examination.  Moreover, the chart of the EXIS queries performed by Scheid, and the printouts of the results of those queries, were introduced into evidence and presented as exhibits to the jury.  Consequently, the jury had this misleading, physical evidence with them in the jury room during deliberations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a>  Does it not stand to reason that the lay juror will accord greater weight to a computer's written findings than to the testimony of a government expert witness?   The common-sense answer is, of course.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority decision in this case not only defies common sense, it is also contrary to our precedent.  In de Jesus-Rios, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604123\"><a href=\"/opinion/604123/united-states-v-jose-de-jesus-rios-aka-papo-rios-united-states-v-eva/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span>, we held that the defendant's due process rights were violated when the district court admitted certain identification testimony by a witness.  Significantly, we concluded that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, even though another witness testified at trial that he also had identified the defendant.  Rather than concluding, as the majority does here, that the one erroneously admitted identification was \"merely cumulative\" of the other, the court reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p>[T]here is no way for us to discern the role that Rivera's identification played in the jury's deliberations.  We are concerned that the jury may have been persuaded to convict by the very fact that there were two witnesses who identified [the defendant].  It is also possible that the jury relied solely upon the testimony of Rivera in reaching its conclusion.  Thus, we find reasonable doubt exists as to whether the jury would have convicted [the defendant] based solely upon Mejias's identification testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604123\"><a href=\"/opinion/604123/united-states-v-jose-de-jesus-rios-aka-papo-rios-united-states-v-eva/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 678 </a></span>(emphasis added).  Is it not equally plausible that the jury in this case \"may have been persuaded to convict\" by the very fact that two \"witnesses\"--Waskom and the EXIS-derived evidence--identified the builder of the Quincy device as the builder of the Roslindale bomb?   Is it not also equally plausible that the jury relied solely upon the EXIS-derived evidence in reaching its conclusion?   Because the EXIS-derived statement came from a computer, and was presented in tangible, exhibit form, it is more powerful and seemingly credible evidence to a lay jury than the testimony of a human being.  The jury may well have relied on the EXIS-derived evidence to break the tie between the competing experts.  This is particularly so since, as the trial judge noted, defendant's expert witness had \"considerably more experience in making ... signature comparisons.\"   Since the EXIS-derived evidence could well have been \"the clincher\" for the jury, it cannot be considered harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Coppola v. Powell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526041\"><a href=\"/opinion/526041/vincent-coppola-v-ronald-l-powell-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1562</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third reason that admission of the EXIS evidence is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt is that the other evidence against Trenkler was not \"overwhelming.\"   See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566796\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Clark,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/566796/sidney-a-clark-v-john-moran-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>.   The majority points to a conglomeration of other testimony in support of its conclusion that there was \"substantial evidence\" of Trenkler's guilt, independent of the Quincy incident.  The test, of course, is not whether there is \"substantial evidence\" of Trenkler's guilt but whether there is \"overwhelming evidence\" of Trenkler's guilt.  The two standards are qualitatively and quantitatively different.  In any case, I will begin by addressing Trenkler's \"statements\" to government agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ATF Agent D'Ambrosio testified that he asked Trenkler to draw a sketch of the Quincy device, which Trenkler did.  D'Ambrosio then told Trenkler that the Roslindale bomb also used remote control, but that, rather than a firecracker type device, it used dynamite.  D'Ambrosio asked Trenkler how, in light of these facts, the wiring diagram he had just drawn for the Quincy device would have been different for the Roslindale bomb.  D'Ambrosio testified that Trenkler then drew a diagram which showed two blasting caps inserted into two sticks of dynamite.  The majority considers this significant evidence of Trenkler's guilt because the fact that the Roslindale bomb used blasting caps had not been publicly disclosed.  The majority fails to note, however, that D'Ambrosio actually testified that at least two blasting caps were used in the Roslindale bombing.  Thus, Trenkler's drawing of only two blasting caps was not an exact match.  Moreover, the jury heard evidence that Trenkler had extensive knowledge of both electronics and explosives, so it is not necessarily significant that Trenkler was able to reconstruct an aspect of the Roslindale bomb, particularly considering the information concerning the bomb provided to Trenkler by D'Ambrosio.  Trenkler merely identified that blasting caps were a likely way in which a bomb of this size and power would be constructed.  In the absence of any testimony that the use of blasting caps is unusual or unique (a proposition which is highly unlikely), the jury could only speculate as to the significance of the drawing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also finds significance in ATF Agent Leahy's testimony that Trenkler said to him:  \"If we did it, then only we know about it ... how will you ever find out ... if neither one of us talk[ ]?\"  The majority paints this statement in a confessional light.  This testimony may or may not have been of some circumstantial relevance to the jury (although standing alone, of course, it would not be sufficient to sustain a conviction).  But, upon review, when the court is looking for \"overwhelming evidence of guilt,\" one would think the court would not have to resort to this sort of an ambiguous, taunting statement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a>  Similarly, the court notes that there was evidence that Trenkler and Shay knew each other, and that Trenkler had knowledge of both electronics and explosives.  While the jury might consider this type of circumstantial evidence relevant, it can hardly be said that it does much in the way of providing \"overwhelming evidence\" of defendant's guilt.  Cf. United States v. Innamorati, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609734\"><a href=\"/opinion/609734/united-states-v-kenneth-innamorati-united-states-v-william-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 476 (1st Cir.1993) (holding that the erroneous admission of inculpatory grand jury testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt when seven people testified at trial that defendant was engaged in marijuana and cocaine dealing, and drugs and money were found in defendant's constructive possession).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority relies most heavily on the testimony of David Lindholm, who testified that Trenkler confessed to building the Roslindale bomb.  But Lindholm had some serious credibility problems which make his testimony \"shaky,\" to say the least.  Lindholm testified that he met Trenkler while Lindholm was serving a 97-month sentence for conspiracy to distribute marijuana and tax evasion.  He further testified that he was in the marijuana business from approximately 1969 through 1988, and that he did not pay any income taxes during that time.  Lindholm also testified that, in order to secure bank loans to purchase property during that period, he showed several banks false income tax returns.  On the basis of Lindholm's shady past alone, the jury might have completely disregarded his testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But Lindholm also had some less obvious credibility problems.  The circumstances of his meeting Trenkler strike me as a little too coincidental.  On December 17, 1992, after a year and a half incarceration in Texas, Lindholm is brought back to Boston concerning certain unspecified charges related to his conviction.  He is then placed in the orientation unit at the Plymouth House of Correction where he meets Alfred Trenkler, who is being held in connection with the Roslindale bombing.  The two subsequently discover that they have an extraordinary amount in common.  First, they are both from the town of Milton, Massachusetts.  Second, Trenkler attended Thayer Academy and Milton Academy, and Lindholm's father also attended Thayer Academy and Milton Academy.  Third, they both lived for a time--overlapping by one year--on White Lawn Avenue in Milton.  Based on these commonalities, and Lindholm's generosity in sharing his knowledge of the criminal justice system with Trenkler, they form a friendship.  Trenkler then, allegedly, confesses to Lindholm that he built the bomb.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, a reasonable juror might question whether Lindholm was placed in the orientation unit by the government for the purpose of obtaining a confession from Trenkler.  If so, that juror would likely wonder what Lindholm got in return.  Not surprisingly, Lindholm testified that he had no agreements with the government and that he did not receive any promises or inducements for his testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a>  He did testify on cross-examination, however, that he knew, when he provided the information about Trenkler to the government, that the only way his 97-month sentence could be reduced was if he supplied new information to the government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not know how much weight the jury gave Lindholm's testimony, but we do know that, at least on paper--for we did not observe his demeanor at trial--Lindholm had some significant credibility problems.  Consequently, I cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have believed his testimony;  particularly in a case such as this where there is absolutely no physical evidence tying Trenkler to the bombing.  Cf. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526041\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Coppola,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/526041/vincent-coppola-v-ronald-l-powell-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1571</span> </a></span>(discounting inculpatory testimony of three jail inmates because it \"raises serious questions of credibility\" and noting the absence of any conclusive physical evidence tying the defendant to the crime).  The only evidence coming near that level of reliability was the improperly admitted EXIS evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent the EXIS-derived evidence, the government's case against Trenkler consists of a smorgasbord of inconclusive circumstantial evidence and an inherently unreliable alleged jailhouse confession.  Faced with this sort of evidence, a reasonable jury would probably look for some sort of tangible evidence upon which to hang its hat.  The EXIS-derived evidence was just that.  Because it was the only ostensibly conclusive evidence tying Trenkler to the crime, it may have been the clincher for the jury.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526041\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Coppola,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/526041/vincent-coppola-v-ronald-l-powell-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1571</span></a></span>.

Unfortunately, and with all due respect to my brethren, I believe the defendant's right to a fair trial was violated when the government was permitted to introduce the highly prejudicial evidence derived from the EXIS computer database.

Here, the government offered the Quincy bomb evidence for the proper Rule 404(b) purpose of identity.  The relevance of the Quincy bomb on the issue of identity turns, however, on the factual question of whether the Roslindale and the Quincy bombings are sufficiently similar to earmark them as the handiwork of the same individual.  This is analogous to whether the television sets in Huddleston were stolen, and, accordingly, Rule 104(b) sets the framework for admissibility.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Though it is unclear from a close reading of the record just how many of the wires in each bomb employed this connection method, it is apparent that at least some did.  More interestingly, we note that, before learning that both bombs had wires that were joined in this fashion, Trenkler's explosives expert stated that such a method is a \"singularly unique method[ ] of assembly which individual bomb makers are very likely to repeat.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> On the other hand, Trenkler argues that the differences between the two bombs are more significant.

With respect to the issues of knowledge and skill, we find little merit in Trenkler's argument.  Obviously, the fact that Trenkler had in the past built a remote-control bomb has some relevance on whether he possessed the skill and knowledge necessary to build the Roslindale bomb.  See United States v.

Furthermore, because the evidence was otherwise admissible to show identity, allowing the government to use it to show skill and knowledge, posed no additional risk of unfair prejudice</p>\n        <p>Trenkler's contention with respect to intent stands on firmer ground.  We have some difficulty comprehending (and the government does not clearly articulate) any theory of \"special relevance\" tending to show intent that does not depend heavily on an inference of propensity.

However, a statement may not be admitted under this exception unless the proponent of it makes known to the adverse party sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to meet it, the proponent's intention to offer the statement and the particulars of it, including the name and address of the declarant.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> Even putting aside our concerns about the reliability of the underlying reports, we remain, in general, somewhat troubled by the government's use of the evidence.  The statement that out of more than 14,000 bombing and attempted bombing incidents in the EXIS database only the Roslindale and Quincy incidents share the eight specific queried characteristics (bombings and attempted bombings, attached under car or truck, remote-control, round magnets, duct tape, solder, AA batteries, toggle switches) is a fairly powerful statement, but perhaps a somewhat misleading one</p>\n        <p>First, the statement assumes as a necessary predicate that each of the more than 14,000 EXIS entries definitively states whether or not the explosive device described therein actually possessed those characteristics.  We have some doubt about the validity of such an assumption.  In general, bomb reconstruction strikes us as a rather resource-intensive operation.  We can envision circumstances (e.g., a blast causing little or no injuries or damage, a bomb maker apprehended before reconstruction investigation complete) where the investigation and the resulting report might not be nearly as thorough or complete as in the case of either the Roslindale or the Quincy bombs.  Indeed, during the preliminary hearing both Scheid and Thomas Waskom, the government's explosives expert, acknowledged that the absence of an item, such as magnets or batteries, from a post-blast report meant only that investigators did not recover or identify the item and not that it was not used.</p>\n        <p>Second, without further statistical analysis of the database, we believe the statement that out of more than 14,000 incidents only the Quincy and Roslindale bombs share the eight queried characteristics is potentially incomplete.  For example, by our count, the EXIS database entry for the Roslindale incident lists approximately twenty-two characteristics describing that incident.  Nowhere in the record, however, does the government explain why it chose to focus on the specific characteristics used to query the database.  It does not suggest that these characteristics are more important in a bomb-signature analysis than any of the other characteristics not chosen.  Moreover, the government does not offer any analysis of the significance of the fact that the Roslindale and the Quincy incidents share the queried characteristics.  In other words, though it is true that only the Quincy incident shares the eight queried characteristics with the Roslindale incident, how many other incidents share some other set of eight (or more  than eight) characteristics with the Roslindale incident?</p>\n        <p>Arguably, these concerns go more to the weight of the evidence than to its admissibility.  However, we point them out here to underscore the caution a district court should employ in allowing evidence couched in terms of numerical probabilities.  Cf. United States v. Massey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"364223\"><a href=\"/opinion/364223/united-states-v-carl-massey/\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></a></span>, 679-81 (8th Cir.1979) (testimony stating probability of match to be one chance in 4,500 unfairly confusing where no foundation for statement provided).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> In general, we review an evidentiary miscue only for harmless error, dismissing it if \"we determine that it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the verdict.\"  Benavente <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553170\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gomez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/553170/united-states-v-pedro-benavente-gomez-united-states-v-guillermo-cerda/\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">386</span> </a></span>(internal quotations and citations omitted).  In this case, however, Trenkler also contends that the erroneously admitted evidence deprived him of his confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment, see U.S. Const. amend.  VI (\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\").  Assuming arguendo that the admission of the EXIS-derived evidence rises to the level of constitutional error, we accordingly employ a stricter standard, asking whether we can consider the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

Indeed, the court's discussion focuses entirely on the expert testimony, with only the passing reference at the end to the EXIS system.

In contrast with our colleague, however, we believe that, when the evidence of Trenkler's participation in the Quincy bombing, which we do not believe was rendered inadmissible by the admission of the EXIS-derived evidence, is added to the \"substantial\" other evidence of Trenkler's guilt, the resulting sum is clearly \"overwhelming.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> We do not understand Trenkler to assert that the district court committed error under the Federal Rules of Evidence in admitting the statements.

See supra pp. 64-65</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn38\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38_ref\">38</a>\n        <p> Federal authorities apparently did not deem the Quincy incident serious enough to warrant bringing charges against Trenkler pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 844(i) (malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive), one of the statutes at issue in this case.  State charges stemming from the Quincy incident were dismissed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn39\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39_ref\">39</a>\n        <p> Of course, the facts generated by the computer are only as accurate and reliable as the facts fed into it by its operator.  As the majority recognizes, in this case the facts fed into the computer were, unbeknownst to the jury, manifestly unreliable.  Thus, its conclusion based on those facts is similarly unreliable</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn40\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40_ref\">40</a>\n        <p> Common sense tells us that lay jurors often will lend more weight to tangible evidence than to oral testimony.  See generally 22 C. Wright &amp; K. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure, Sec. 5173 (1978) (\"It is often asserted that the psychological impact of the concrete has a capacity to suggest matters not proved, to lead the jury to draw unconscious inferences that would not be drawn if the object was the subject of testimony rather than being produced in court.\")  (internal citations omitted).

They tend to assume it is more accurate and objective than lay testimony.  A juror who thinks of scientific evidence visualizes instruments capable of amazingly precise measurement, of findings arrived at by dispassionate scientific tests.  In short, in the mind of the typical lay juror, a scientific witness has a special aura of credibility.</p>\n        <p>Imwinkelried, Evidence Law and Tactics for the Proponents of Scientific Evidence, In Scientific and Expert Evidence 33, 37 (E. Imwinkelried ed. 1981).  See also Giannelli, The Admissibility of Novel Scientific Evidence:  Frye v. United States, a Half-Century Later, 80 Colum.L.Rev. 1197, 1237 (1980) (\"The major danger of scientific evidence is its potential to mislead the jury;  an aura of scientific infallibility may shroud the evidence and thus lead the jury to accept it without critical scrutiny.\");   22 C. Wright &amp; K. Graham, supra note 41, Sec. 5217 (\"Scientific ... evidence has great potential for misleading the jury.  The low probative worth can often be concealed in the jargon of some expert ...\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn42\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42_ref\">42</a>\n        <p> In Coppola, for example, we lent little weight to defendant's statement to another inmate--\"What did I have to lose?\"--in response to a question whether he had committed the rape.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526041\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> <a href=\"/opinion/526041/vincent-coppola-v-ronald-l-powell-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1569-70</span></a></span></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn43\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43_ref\">43</a>\n        <p> If the government makes an explicit promise to a witness, of course, this will come out at trial and likely decrease the witness's credibility in the eyes of the jury.  But if the government lawyers explain to the witness why they do not want to make any explicit promises, leaving the inference that one good deed begets another, the witness can testify that he has no agreement.  I note, in this regard, that this court has previously questioned the validity of these \"no agreement\" statements by criminal defendants.  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526041\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Coppola,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/526041/vincent-coppola-v-ronald-l-powell-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1569-70</span></a></span></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn44\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44_ref\">44</a>\n        <p> When asked on direct examination why he testified, Lindholm stated:</p>\n        <p>Since I have been incarcerated, I have come to realize that the sole function of prison is not just punishment.  I think rehabilitation is important for an individual.  And I think, when I talk about rehabilitation, I mean rehabilitation of a person's values in terms of how they live one's life and the decisions they make, knowing the decisions they make, knowing the difference between what's wrong and what's right, what's illegal and legal.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
