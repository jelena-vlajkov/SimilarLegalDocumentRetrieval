Defendant-appellant Antonio  Manuela-\r                                \r\n\nLazu appeals  from the district court's  summary dismissal of\r\n\nhis motion  under 28 U.S.C.    2255  to vacate, set  aside or\r\n\ncorrect his sentence.  We affirm.\r\n\n     Manuela  pleaded  guilty  to  one count  of  a  39-count\r\n\nindictment  charging  him  and  numerous  co-defendants  with\r\n\nconspiring  to  possess  with  intent  to  distribute  10,000\r\n\nkilograms of cocaine and 1,000  kilograms of marihuana.   The\r\n\ngovernment and  Manuela stipulated,  for the purposes  of the\r\n\nplea  agreement,   that  Manuela  was   responsible  for  the\r\n\nimportation or  distribution of \"more than  150 kilograms but\r\n\nless  than 500  kilograms of  cocaine, including  conduct for\r\n\nwhich  the  defendant  would   be  otherwise  accountable  by\r\n\napplication  of  U.S.S.G.     1B1.3.\"   The  plea  agreement,\r\n\nconsistent with the stipulation, provided that the applicable\r\n\nbase offense level was 38.  The sentencing court accepted the\r\n\nrecommended base offense level and, accordingly, arrived at a\r\n\nguideline sentencing range of  188 to 235 months.   The court\r\n\nsentenced him to 188  months' imprisonment.  Manuela  did not\r\n\nappeal.\r\n\n     In his    2255 motion, Manuela claims  that the district\r\n\ncourt's failure to make  an independent finding regarding the\r\n\nquantity of drugs for  which he was individually responsible,\r\n\nviolated due  process.  \"[F]ailure to  raise a constitutional\r\n\nissue  [except ineffective  assistance of counsel]  on direct\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nappeal will bar raising the issue on collateral attack unless\r\n\nthe defendant  can  show cause  for  the failure  and  actual\r\n\nprejudice.\" Knight  v.

Accordingly,  it  is\r\n\nunnecessary to address the  prejudice prong of the cause-and-\r\n\nprejudice  test.    Nor   has  Manuela  demonstrated  that  a\r\n\nfundamental  miscarriage  of  justice  will  result  from the\r\n\ndismissal of his due process claim.   He has not claimed that\r\n\nhe entered  the stipulation involuntarily or  that the guilty\r\n\nplea is in any way defective.  Moreover, the PSR reveals that\r\n\nthere is a reasonable factual basis for the quantity of drugs\r\n\nthat Manuela stipulated to.
