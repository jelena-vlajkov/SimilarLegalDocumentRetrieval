In March  of  1990,  William\r                                        \n\nCameron,  whose left leg had been amputated below the knee in\n\n1965, was fitted with  a prosthetic leg.  The  prosthesis was\n\nassembled   by  Mr.  Cameron's  prosthetist  from  components\n\noriginally  sold by  various suppliers,  including  Otto Bock\n\nOrthopedic Industry,  Inc. (\"Otto Bock\").   Specifically, the\n\nartificial  limb featured  an Otto  Bock pylon,  which  is an\n\naluminum tube that substitutes for the missing portion of the\n\nleg, and an Otto Bock  clamp, which attaches the pylon to  an\n\nartificial foot manufactured and sold by another company.\n\n     On May 28,  1991, Mr.  Cameron fell when  the Otto  Bock\n\npylon in his artificial  leg broke into two pieces.   Cameron\n\nalleged  that he  suffered a  fractured pelvis  and emotional\n\ndamage  as  a  result  of  the  fall.    Based  on  diversity\n\njurisdiction, Mr.  Cameron sued  Otto Bock in  federal court,\n\ncharging negligence and  breach of warranty.   His wife,  Kay\n\nCameron, claimed loss of consortium.\n\n     The  case  was  tried by  a  jury in  1993.    Each side\n\nattributed the failure of  the leg to a different cause.  The\n\nCamerons  claimed   that  the   pylon  and  clamp   had  been\n\nnegligently  and defectively  designed.   Otto Bock's  expert\n\ntestified that  the prosthesis  broke because the  screw that\n\nfastened the  pylon to the  clamp had been  \"overtorqued,\" or\n\nscrewed too  tightly, by  the prosthetist, despite  a warning\n\nagainst overtightening by  Otto Bock.  The Camerons said that\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nthe instructions should  have been more  detailed.  The  jury\n\nfound in favor of Otto Bock and the Camerons appeal.\n\n     In this court, the Camerons' claims of error concern two\n\nrulings by  the district court excluding  evidence offered by\n\nthem.   The first ruling excluded  several so-called \"product\n\nfailure reports\" sent from prosthetists to Otto Bock.   These\n\nexcluded  reports, all  dated after  Mr. Cameron's  accident,\n\ndetail  the alleged failures  of other prosthetic  legs.  The\n\nsecond  group  of  excluded  documents  consisted   of  \"Dear\n\nCustomer\" letters,  sent by  Otto Bock to  prosthetists after\n\nthe  Cameron   accident,   that  provided   specific   torque\n\nmeasurements to be used when screwing the pylon to the clamp.\n\n     1.   The product  failure reports  in question  are one-\n\npage  standardized forms that a prosthetist  must fill out in\n\norder to obtain  a refund or credit for an Otto Bock product.\n\nThe forms were designed  by Otto Bock, but were  completed by\n\nprosthetists   who,  in   turn,   typically  obtained   their\n\ninformation from conversations with their patients.  The form\n\nrequired information about the nature of the problem, the age\n\nof the prosthesis, the demands  placed on the prosthesis, and\n\nthe patient's  activity when the accident  occurred; the form\n\ndid not inquire directly about the cause of the problem.\n\n     The  trial  judge  allowed  the  Camerons  to  introduce\n\nproduct failure reports that  were dated before Mr. Cameron's\r                                                           \n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\naccident, solely to  show notice  on the part  of Otto  Bock.\n\nThe trial  judge excluded  several reports that  were created\n\nafter Mr.  Cameron's accident and  it is this  exclusion that\n\nthe Camerons claim to be error.  There is some  doubt whether\n\nthe Camerons adequately raised and preserved this claim--Otto\n\nBock says they did not.  However,  the district court did not\n\nrest  its  exclusion on  this ground  and,  as we  uphold the\n\nexclusion on  the  merits, we  need  not decide  whether  the\n\nCamerons waived the issue.\n\n     The  district  court  held  that the  exclusion  of  the\n\nreports was proper because they were irrelevant, because they\n\ndid  not fall within any  exception to the  hearsay rule, and\n\nbecause  they  were  more  prejudicial than  probative.    We\n\ncommonly say  that we review all  three determinations solely\n\nfor   an  abuse  of  discretion.1     This  may   be  a  mild\n\noverstatement since evidentiary rulings can sometimes contain\n\nburied rulings of law reviewable  de novo, or basic  findings\r                                                     \n\nof fact subject to  clear error review.   In this case,  fine\n\ndistinctions about  the standard  of review would  not affect\n\nthe outcome.  \n\n     Unlike the pre-accident reports,  which were admitted to\n\nshow  notice  on the  part  of Otto  Bock,  the post-accident\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     1United States  v.

Vincent v. Louis Marx &amp;\r                                                                         \n\nCo., Inc., 874 F.2d  36, 43 (1st Cir. 1989); McKinnon v. Skil\r                                                                         \n\nCorp.,  638 F.2d 270, 277 (1st Cir. 1981).  The circumstances\r                 \n\nof the post-accident incidents are entirely unknown.\n\n     We  also think that there  is an adequate  basis for the\n\ndistrict  court's  alternative  conclusion that  the  reports\n\ncontained inadmissible hearsay.   This did  not matter as  to\n\npre-accident reports  offered solely  to show notice;  but in\n\norder to show defect,  the truth of the reports  is critical.\n\nYet it appears  that the information contained in the reports\n\nwas provided  to Otto Bock from  independent prosthetists who\n\nthemselves derived  some or all of the information from their\n\nown patients.\n\n     While the reports may be part of the business records of\n\nOtto  Bock  in  a  colloquial sense,  that  does  not  render\n\nadmissible information contained in the  records whose source\n\nis a non-party to the business.  Under Fed.  R. Evid. 803(6),\n\nthe report must be made by  a person acting \"in the course of\n\na regularly conducted  business activity.\"  It is quite clear\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nthat the prosthetists' patients  are not part of  Otto Bock's\n\nbusiness.   The case is  akin to Petrocelli  v. Gallison, 679\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d 286, 290 (1st Cir. 1982),  where we held that a hospital\n\npatient who related  his medical  history \"is not  part of  a\n\n`business'  routine in  which  he is  individually a  regular\n\nparticipant.\"\n\n     We thus have  no reason to consider whether the business\n\nrecords  exception  might  apply  if   the  information  were\n\ngenerated solely by the  prosthetists in the course of  their\n\nown businesses.   See Fed. R.  Evid. 805 (hearsay  exceptions\r                                 \n\ncan  be  layered).   Conversely,  we  need  not  pass on  the\n\nsuggestion that the adverse interests of the prosthetists--in\n\nobtaining  refunds and  warding off  lawsuits against  them--\n\nmight  permit   exclusion  of   any  business   records  they\n\nthemselves generated as to  the cause of a failure  under the\n\nexclusion for business records whose source \"indicate[s] lack\n\nof  trustworthiness.\"  Fed. R.  Evid. 803(6).   See Palmer v.\r                                                                      \n\nHoffman, 318 U.S. 109 (1943).\r                   \n\n     Since both the relevance and hearsay objections are well\n\nfounded,  we need not consider in detail the district court's\n\nfurther  ruling that  prejudice would  substantially outweigh\n\nrelevance.   Fed. R. Evid. 403.  We do  note that the lack of\n\nproof of similarity of circumstances reinforces  any decision\n\nto exclude under  Rule 403.   Additionally, in  this kind  of\n\nbalancing of prejudice and  relevance, abuse of discretion is\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nundoubtedly  the  test on  review,  and  Rule 403  judgments,\n\ncalling on the district court's \"feel\" for the situation, are\n\nquite unlikely to be disturbed.   \n\n     2.   The Camerons'  other  challenge  is  to  the  trial\n\njudge's  exclusion  of  letters  sent by  Otto  Bock  to  its\n\nprosthetist customers after Mr.  Cameron's fall.  These \"Dear\n\nCustomer\" letters specified, inter  alia, the specific torque\r                                                    \n\nlevels that should be  observed in screwing the pylon  to the\n\nclamp in prosthetic limbs like Mr. Cameron's.  Arguably these\n\nletters, if sent earlier,  would have prevented Mr. Cameron's\n\naccident.    The  Camerons  contend  that  such  letters  are\n\nevidence   that  Otto   Bock  breached   its   warranties  of\n\nmerchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.\n\n     The trial judge excluded the  letters on the ground that\n\nthe furnishing  of precise  torque measurements was  a safety\n\nmeasure undertaken after the accident, and  thus inadmissible\n\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 407, which provides:\n\n             When,  after  an  event, measures  are\n          taken which, if  taken previously,  would\n          have made the event less likely to occur,\n          evidence  of  the subsequent  measures is\n          not  admissible  to  prove negligence  or\n          culpable conduct in  connection with  the\n          event.   This rule  does not  require the\n          exclusion   of  evidence   of  subsequent\n          measures   when   offered   for   another\n          purpose,   such  as   proving  ownership,\n          control, or  feasibility of precautionary\n          measures,     if     controverted,     or\n          impeachment.\n\n     The Camerons argue first  that the Dear Customer letters\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nshould  have  been  admitted   to  show  the  feasibility  of\r                                                                     \n\nproviding  the torque  measurements earlier  and to  show the\n\ncontrol  Otto Bock  exerted  over its  prosthetist customers.\r                   \n\nThese exceptions  apply, however,  only  \"if\" feasibility  or\n\ncontrol are  \"controverted.\"   The feasibility of  giving the\n\ntorque  measurements was  certainly  not  controverted.   The\n\ndefense offered  to stipulate to feasibility,  cf. Raymond v.\r                                                                      \n\nRaymond  Corp., 938 F.2d 1518  (1st Cir. 1991);  and when the\r                         \n\nCamerons rejected the offer, apparently for tactical reasons,\n\nthe  district  court instructed  the  jury  that the  further\n\ninformation could feasibly have been distributed.\n\n     \"Control\" is also a non-issue.  Otto Bock never disputed\n\nthat it provided advice to the prosthetists who assembled its\n\nproducts.   Nor  did  it deny  that  providing more  detailed\n\nmeasurements  might  have avoided  the accident;  indeed, its\n\nposition  was that  the screw  was overtightened  and  it had\n\nnever  provided specific numbers  prior to the  accident.  If\n\nthe Camerons justify the introduction of the letters in order\n\nto show causation, as their brief implies, then we think that\n\nthe \"if controverted\" condition is not satisfied.\n\n     The  Camerons do  not  appear to  be  claiming that  the\n\nprosthetists were effectively employees  of Otto Bock so that\n\nit  might  be  vicariously   liable  for  the  negligence  of\n\nCameron's own  prosthetist on a master-servant  theory.  Even\n\nif the Camerons had advanced such  a claim, the raw fact that\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nOtto  Bock provided directions for the use of its product was\n\nundisputed  and that is the  most that the  Camerons would be\n\nentitled to derive from the letters.   There may also be some\n\ndoubt whether  \"control\" in the master-servant  sense is what\n\nthe drafters of Rule 407 had in mind, but we need not explore\n\nthis interesting issue.    \n\n     The Camerons  also argue that the  Dear Customer letters\n\nshould  have been admitted  as direct  evidence of  breach of\n\nwarranty--i.e., as  evidence  that the  Otto Bock  components\r                          \n\nwere  defective--because,  under   Massachusetts  law,   such\n\nevidence might be admissible in a state trial.  This circuit,\n\nhowever, has  long held that  the Federal Rules  of Evidence,\n\nand specifically  Rule 407,  apply in  diversity proceedings,\n\nbecause they \"address procedural  matters, [were] duly passed\n\nby Congress, [and]  shall be presumed constitutionally  valid\n\nunless they  cannot rationally  be characterized as  rules of\n\nprocedure.\"   McInnis v. A.M.F., Inc., 765 F.2d 240, 244 (1st\r                                                 \n\nCir. 1985). Compare Fed.  R. Evid. 501 (providing that  state\r                               \n\nprivilege law governs in diversity cases).\n\n     Finally,  the  Camerons argue  that,  even  if Rule  407\n\napplies,  by its  terms it  prohibits evidence  of subsequent\n\nremedial  measures  only  \"to  prove negligence  or  culpable\n\nconduct in  connection with the  event.\"  The  Camerons argue\n\nthat breach of warranty, according to Massachusetts law, does\n\nnot constitute \"negligence or culpable conduct.\"  We recently\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nrejected this very argument in Raymond  v.

Specifically, the artificial limb featured an Otto Bock pylon, which is an aluminum tube that substitutes for the missing portion of the leg, and an Otto Bock clamp, which attaches the pylon to an artificial foot manufactured and sold by another company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 28, 1991, Mr. Cameron fell when the Otto Bock pylon in his artificial leg broke into two pieces.  Cameron alleged that he suffered a fractured pelvis and emotional damage as a result of the fall.  Based on diversity jurisdiction, Mr. Cameron sued Otto Bock in federal court, charging negligence and breach of warranty.  His wife, Kay Cameron, claimed loss of consortium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried by a jury in 1993.  Each side attributed the failure of the leg to a different cause.  The Camerons claimed that the pylon and clamp had been negligently and defectively designed.  Otto Bock's expert testified that the prosthesis broke because the screw that fastened the pylon to the clamp had been \"overtorqued,\" or screwed too tightly, by the prosthetist, despite a warning against overtightening by Otto Bock.  The Camerons said that the instructions should have been more detailed.  The jury found in favor of Otto Bock and the Camerons appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court, the Camerons' claims of error concern two rulings by the district court excluding evidence offered by them.  The first ruling excluded several so-called \"product failure reports\" sent from prosthetists to Otto Bock.  These excluded reports, all dated after Mr. Cameron's accident, detail the alleged failures of other prosthetic legs.  The second group of excluded documents consisted of \"Dear Customer\" letters, sent by Otto Bock to prosthetists after the Cameron accident, that provided specific torque measurements to be used when screwing the pylon to the clamp.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  The product failure reports in question are one-page standardized forms that a prosthetist must fill out in order to obtain a refund or credit for an Otto Bock product.  The forms were designed by Otto Bock, but were completed by prosthetists who, in turn, typically obtained their information from conversations with their patients.  The form required information about the nature of the problem, the age of the prosthesis, the demands placed on the prosthesis, and the patient's activity when the accident occurred;  the form did not inquire directly about the cause of the problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge allowed the Camerons to introduce product failure reports that were dated before Mr. Cameron's accident, solely to show notice on the part of Otto Bock.  The trial judge excluded several reports that were created after Mr. Cameron's accident and it is this exclusion that the Camerons claim to be error.  There is some doubt whether the Camerons adequately raised and preserved this claim--Otto Bock says they did not.  However, the district court did not rest its exclusion on this ground and, as we uphold the exclusion on the merits, we need not decide whether the Camerons waived the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that the exclusion of the reports was proper because they were irrelevant, because they did not fall within any exception to the hearsay rule, and because they were more prejudicial than probative.  We commonly say that we review all three determinations solely for an abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  This may be a mild overstatement since evidentiary rulings can sometimes contain buried rulings of law reviewable de novo, or basic findings of fact subject to clear error review.  In this case, fine distinctions about the standard of review would not affect the outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the pre-accident reports, which were admitted to show notice on the part of Otto Bock, the post-accident reports describe incidents that took place after Mr. Cameron's accident, and thus have no bearing on notice.  Neither are they relevant as evidence of a design defect.  The reports of other incidents would be probative evidence of the existence of a design defect only if the incidents occurred under circumstances substantially similar to those surrounding Mr. Cameron's accident.  Vincent v. Louis Marx &amp; Co., Inc., 874 F.2d 36, 43 (1st Cir.1989);  McKinnon v. Skil Corp., 638 F.2d 270, 277 (1st Cir.1981).  The circumstances of the post-accident incidents are entirely unknown.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also think that there is an adequate basis for the district court's alternative conclusion that the reports contained inadmissible hearsay.  This did not matter as to pre-accident reports offered solely to show notice;  but in order to show defect, the truth of the reports is critical.  Yet it appears that the information contained in the reports was provided to Otto Bock from independent prosthetists who themselves derived some or all of the information from their own patients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the reports may be part of the business records of Otto Bock in a colloquial sense, that does not render admissible information contained in the records whose source is a non-party to the business.  Under Fed.R.Evid. 803(6), the report must be made by a person acting \"in the course of a regularly conducted business activity.\"   It is quite clear that the prosthetists' patients are not part of Otto Bock's business.  The case is akin to Petrocelli v. Gallison, 679 F.2d 286, 290 (1st Cir.1982), where we held that a hospital patient who related his medical history \"is not part of a 'business' routine in which he is individually a regular participant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus have no reason to consider whether the business records exception might apply if the information were generated solely by the prosthetists in the course of their own businesses.  See Fed.R.Evid. 805 (hearsay exceptions can be layered).  Conversely, we need not pass on the suggestion that the adverse interests of the prosthetists--in obtaining refunds and warding off lawsuits against them--might permit exclusion of any business records they themselves generated as to the cause of a failure under the exclusion for business records whose source \"indicate[s] lack of trustworthiness.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 803(6).  See Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since both the relevance and hearsay objections are well founded, we need not consider in detail the district court's further ruling that prejudice would substantially outweigh relevance.  Fed.R.Evid. 403.  We do note that the lack of proof of similarity of circumstances reinforces any decision to exclude under Rule 403.  Additionally, in this kind of balancing of prejudice and relevance, abuse of discretion is undoubtedly the test on review, and Rule 403 judgments, calling on the district court's \"feel\" for the situation, are quite unlikely to be disturbed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  The Camerons' other challenge is to the trial judge's exclusion of letters sent by Otto Bock to its prosthetist customers after Mr. Cameron's fall.  These \"Dear Customer\" letters specified, inter alia, the specific torque levels that should be observed in screwing the pylon to the clamp in prosthetic limbs like Mr. Cameron's.  Arguably these letters, if sent earlier, would have prevented Mr. Cameron's accident.  The Camerons contend that such letters are evidence that Otto Bock breached its warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge excluded the letters on the ground that the furnishing of precise torque measurements was a safety measure undertaken after the accident, and thus inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 407, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, after an event, measures are taken which, if taken previously, would have made the event less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct in connection with the event.  This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when offered for another purpose, such as proving ownership, control, or feasibility of precautionary measures, if controverted, or impeachment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Camerons argue first that the Dear Customer letters should have been admitted to show the feasibility of providing the torque measurements earlier and to show the control Otto Bock exerted over its prosthetist customers.  These exceptions apply, however, only \"if\" feasibility or control are \"controverted.\"   The feasibility of giving the torque measurements was certainly not controverted.  The defense offered to stipulate to feasibility, cf. Raymond v. Raymond Corp., 938 F.2d 1518 (1st Cir.1991);  and when the Camerons rejected the offer, apparently for tactical reasons, the district court instructed the jury that the further information could feasibly have been distributed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Control\" is also a non-issue.  Otto Bock never disputed that it provided advice to the prosthetists who assembled its products.  Nor did it deny that providing more detailed measurements might have avoided the accident;  indeed, its position was that the screw was overtightened and it had never provided specific numbers prior to the accident.  If the Camerons justify the introduction of the letters in order to show causation, as their brief implies, then we think that the \"if controverted\" condition is not satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Camerons do not appear to be claiming that the prosthetists were effectively employees of Otto Bock so that it might be vicariously liable for the negligence of Cameron's own prosthetist on a master-servant theory.  Even if the Camerons had advanced such a claim, the raw fact that Otto Bock provided directions for the use of its product was undisputed and that is the most that the Camerons would be entitled to derive from the letters.  There may also be some doubt whether \"control\" in the master-servant sense is what the drafters of Rule 407 had in mind, but we need not explore this interesting issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Camerons also argue that the Dear Customer letters should have been admitted as direct evidence of breach of warranty--i.e., as evidence that the Otto Bock components were defective--because, under Massachusetts law, such evidence might be admissible in a state trial.  This circuit, however, has long held that the Federal Rules of Evidence, and specifically Rule 407, apply in diversity proceedings, because they \"address procedural matters, [were] duly passed by Congress, [and] shall be presumed constitutionally valid unless they cannot rationally be characterized as rules of procedure.\"  McInnis v. A.M.F., Inc., 765 F.2d 240, 244 (1st Cir.1985).  Compare Fed.R.Evid. 501 (providing that state privilege law governs in diversity cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Camerons argue that, even if Rule 407 applies, by its terms it prohibits evidence of subsequent remedial measures only \"to prove negligence or culpable conduct in connection with the event.\"   The Camerons argue that breach of warranty, according to Massachusetts law, does not constitute \"negligence or culpable conduct.\"   We recently rejected this very argument in Raymond v. Raymond Corp., 938 F.2d 1518, 1522 (1st Cir.1991).  The Camerons urge us to reconsider Raymond, but they offer us no grounds for doing so that were not before this court in that case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> United States v.

If the Camerons justify the introduction of the letters in order to show causation, as their brief implies, then we think that the \"if controverted\" condition is not satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Camerons do not appear to be claiming that the prosthetists were effectively employees of Otto Bock so that it might be vicariously liable for the negligence of Cameron's own prosthetist on a master-servant theory.  Even if the Camerons had advanced such a claim, the raw fact that Otto Bock provided directions for the use of its product was undisputed and that is the most that the Camerons would be entitled to derive from the letters.  There may also be some doubt whether \"control\" in the master-servant sense is what the drafters of Rule 407 had in mind, but we need not explore this interesting issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Camerons also argue that the Dear Customer letters should have been admitted as direct evidence of breach of warranty--i.e., as evidence that the Otto Bock components were defective--because, under Massachusetts law, such evidence might be admissible in a state trial.  This circuit, however, has long held that the Federal Rules of Evidence, and specifically Rule 407, apply in diversity proceedings, because they \"address procedural matters, [were] duly passed by Congress, [and] shall be presumed constitutionally valid unless they cannot rationally be characterized as rules of procedure.\"  McInnis v. A.M.F., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454262\"><a href=\"/opinion/454262/patricia-j-mcinnis-v-amf-inc-patricia-j-mcinnis-v-amf-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span>, 244 (1st Cir.1985).  Compare Fed.R.Evid. 501 (providing that state privilege law governs in diversity cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Camerons argue that, even if Rule 407 applies, by its terms it prohibits evidence of subsequent remedial measures only \"to prove negligence or culpable conduct in connection with the event.\"   The Camerons argue that breach of warranty, according to Massachusetts law, does not constitute \"negligence or culpable conduct.\"   We recently rejected this very argument in Raymond v. Raymond Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564962\"><a href=\"/opinion/564962/33-fed-r-evid-serv-1294-prodliabrepcchp-12860-jeanne-raymond/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1518</span></a></span>, 1522 (1st Cir.1991).  The Camerons urge us to reconsider Raymond, but they offer us no grounds for doing so that were not before this court in that case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> United States v.
