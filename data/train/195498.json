This appeal asks us\n          BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.\n                                      \n\nto  decide whether a foreign arbitration clause in a maritime\n\nbill of lading governed by the  Carriage of Goods at Sea Act,\n\n46  U.S.C.    1300  et seq.

We\n                                               \n\nconclude  that the  FAA  controls, and  that the  arbitration\n\nclause is  valid.   Accordingly,  the order  of the  district\n\ncourt  staying this  action pending  arbitration in  Tokyo is\n\naffirmed.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          Plaintiff-appellant   Bacchus   Associates   is   a\n\nwholesale fruit  distributor in the Northeast  United States.\n\nBacchus was  the owner of  a shipment  of oranges  travelling\n\nfrom  Agadir,  Morocco  to  New  Bedford,  Massachusetts,  in\n\nFebruary  1991 aboard the SKY REEFER,1 a vessel owned by M.H.\n\nMaritima,  S.A.   Maritima had  time-chartered the  vessel to\n\nHonma Senpaku Co.,  Ltd., who  in turn  time-chartered it  to\n\nNichiro Corp.   Bacchus  entered into a  voyage charter  with\n\nNichiro for the February 1991 voyage.\n\n                    \n\n1.  The subrogated underwriter of the oranges,  Vimar Seguros\nY Reaseguros,  is also a plaintiff-appellant  in this action.\nHereafter,   references  to   Bacchus  include   Vimar  where\napplicable.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n          The  oranges were  shipped under  a bill  of lading\n\nissued in Morocco by Nichiro.  The bill of lading constitutes\n\nthe contract  of carriage between  Bacchus and Maritima.   En\n\nroute to New Bedford, numerous boxes of oranges were crushed.\n\nBacchus filed an  action in the United  States District Court\n\nfor the  District of Massachusetts,  in rem  against the  SKY\n                                           \n\nREEFER, and in personam  against Maritima, seeking to recover\n                       \n\napproximately $1 million in damages.\n\n          Maritima  moved  to  stay  the  action  and  compel\n\narbitration  in Tokyo  pursuant to  a clause  in the  bill of\n\nlading:\n\n          Governing Law and Arbitration\n          (1)   The   contract   evidenced  by   or\n          contained in this Bill of Lading shall be\n          governed by Japanese Law.\n\n          (2) Any dispute arising from this Bill of\n          Lading shall be  referred to  arbitration\n          in   Tokyo   by   the    Tokyo   Maritime\n          Arbitration  Commission  (TOMAC)  at  the\n          Japan   Shipping   Exchange,   Inc.,   in\n          accordance  with the  Rules of  TOMAC and\n          any  agreement  thereto,  and  the  award\n          given by  the arbitrators shall  be final\n          and binding on both parties. \n\nThe district court held that the arbitration clause contained\n\nin subsection (2) was enforceable, granted Maritima's  motion\n\nfor a  stay pending arbitration, and  certified the following\n\nquestion  for interlocutory  appeal pursuant  to 28  U.S.C.  \n\n1292(b):   \"[W]hether 46 U.S.C.    1303(8) [   3(8) of COGSA]\n\nnullifies an arbitration clause contained in a bill of lading\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\ngoverned by COGSA.\"  With this question in mind, we begin our\n\njourney through unsettled statutory waters.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          COGSA was passed in  1936 as the American enactment\n\nof the Hague Rules,  and was part of an  international effort\n\nto achieve uniformity  and simplicity in bills of lading used\n\nin  foreign trade.

Id. at  204.  The\n                                               \n\ncourt reasoned as follows:\n\n          From a practical  standpoint, to  require\n          an American plaintiff to assert his claim\n          only  in  a  distant  court  lessens  the\n\n                    \n\n2.  This provision provides as follows:\n\n          Any  clause, covenant  or agreement  in a\n          contract   of   carriage  relieving   the\n          carrier  or the  ship from  liability for\n          loss or  damage to or  in connection with\n          the   goods,  arising   from  negligence,\n          fault,   or  failure  in  the  duties  or\n          obligations provided in this  section, or\n          lessening  such liability  otherwise than\n          as  provided in this  Act, shall  be null\n          and void and of no effect.\n\n46 U.S.C.   1303(8).\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n          liability    of    the   carrier    quite\n          substantially,   particularly  when   the\n          claim is  small.   Such a clause  puts \"a\n          high  hurdle\" in  the  way  of  enforcing\n          liability, and thus is an effective means\n          for carriers to secure  settlements lower\n          than  if  cargo  [sic]  could  sue  in  a\n          convenient forum.\n\nId.  at 203.3  Moreover,  \"[a] clause making  a claim triable\n   \n\nonly  in  a  foreign  court  would  almost  certainly  lessen\n\nliability  if the  law which  the court  would apply  was not\n\n[COGSA].\"  Id.  Furthermore,\n              \n\n          [e]ven when the foreign court would apply\n          [COGSA],  requiring  trial  abroad  might\n                                                   \n          lessen  the   carrier's  liability  since\n          there could be no assurance that it would\n          apply [COGSA] in the same way as would an\n          American tribunal subject to  the uniform\n          control  of the Supreme Court . . . .  We\n          think that Congress  meant to  invalidate\n          any  contractual provision  in a  bill of\n          lading  for a  shipment  to  or from  the\n          United  States  that would  prevent cargo\n          [sic] able to  obtain jurisdiction over a\n          carrier in an American court  from having\n          that court entertain  the suit and  apply\n          the   substantive   rules  Congress   had\n          prescribed.\n\n                    \n\n3.  The court also concluded  that COGSA, wherever it governs\na  bill  of lading,  requires  application  of American  law.\nIndussa, 377 F.2d at 203; see generally Thomas J. Schoenbaum,\n                                       \nAdmiralty  &amp; Maritime Law    9-18 at 326-27  (Pra. ed. 1987).\n                         \nBacchus contends  that the  Japanese choice-of-law  clause in\nits bill of lading, in addition to the arbitration clause, is\nnull and void under   3(8) of COGSA, and, alternatively, that\nthe  \"Local Law\" clause in  the bill of  lading requires that\nCOGSA, and  not Japanese law, governs,  because COGSA applies\nex proprio vigore.   Although both of  these arguments appear\n                 \nto  be  substantial, only  the  validity  of the  arbitration\nclause is at issue on this interlocutory appeal.  In light of\nour holding,  the choice-of-law question must  be decided, in\nthe first instance, by an arbitrator.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nId.  at  203-04 (emphasis  in  original)  (citations omitted)\n   \n\n(footnote omitted).\n\n          Since Indussa,   3(8) has been consistently used by\n                       \n\nfederal courts to invalidate forum selection clauses in bills\n\nof lading governed by  COGSA.

COGSA, enacted\n          in 1936, made  no reference to that  form\n          of   procedure.     If   there   be   any\n                                                   \n          inconsistency   between  the   two  acts,\n                                                   \n          presumably  the   Arbitration  Act  would\n                                                   \n          prevail by virtue  of its reenactment  as\n                                                   \n          positive law in 1947.\n                              \n\nIndussa, 377  F.2d at  204 n.4 (citations  omitted) (emphasis\n       \nadded).

Second, where two  statutes conflict, regardless\n\nof the priority of enactment, the specific statute ordinarily\n\ncontrols  the  general.   See  Watson v.  Fraternal  Order of\n                                                             \n\nEagles, 915 F.2d 235,  240 (6th Cir. 1990); see  generally 2B\n                                                          \n\nSutherland Statutory Construction,   51.05 at 174.\n                                 \n\n          With  respect to the former  canon, the FAA must be\n\ngiven priority over COGSA in  light of the FAA's  reenactment\n\nin 1947, eleven years after COGSA was passed.  Similarly, the\n\nlatter  canon suggests that the FAA be given effect.  Section\n\n3(8) of  COGSA, which voids  any clause  in a bill  of lading\n\nthat \"lessens\" the carrier's liability, makes no reference to\n\narbitration, or  for that  matter, forum  selection clauses.7\n\nConversely,  the  FAA   specifically  validates   arbitration\n\nclauses  contained in maritime bills of lading.  See 9 U.S.C.\n                                                    \n\n   1, 2.\n\n                    \n\n82 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (stating  that Indussa footnote \"probably\"\n                                         \nrequires enforcement of  foreign arbitration clause  in COGSA\nbill  of lading).  But  see Siderius, 613  F.

In fact,  up until Indussa, the  Second Circuit regularly\n                              \nenforced foreign  forum selection clauses in  bills of lading\ngoverned  by COGSA.   See, e.g., William  H. Muller  &amp; Co. v.\n                                                          \nSwedish Amer.

See Ecuadorian  Reefer, 754  F.\n                                                    \n\nSupp. at 233-34.  The  existence of this policy distinguishes\n\nthe present  case from foreign choice-of-forum  cases because\n\nin those cases \"there was no compelling congressional mandate\n\nin  favor of giving  effect to agreements  to litigate before\n\nforeign tribunals.\"  MS Galini, 323 F. Supp. at 83.\n                              \n\n          Furthermore, American courts'  mistrust of  foreign\n\ncourts,  a driving force  in the Indussa  court's decision to\n                                        \n\ninvalidate   foreign   choice-of-forum    clauses,   is    an\n\ninappropriate  consideration in  the context  of arbitration.\n\nSee  Mitsubishi Motors, 473 U.S. at 626-27 (We are \"well past\n                      \n\nthe time when judicial suspicion of . . . arbitration  and of\n\nthe   competence  of   arbitral   tribunals   inhibited   the\n\ndevelopment of arbitration as an alternative means of dispute\n\nresolution.\"); Connolly, 883 F.2d  at 1119 (\"[C]ourts must be\n                       \n\non  guard  for artifices  in which  the ancient  suspicion of\n\narbitration  might reappear.\").   Finally,  unlike a  foreign\n\nforum selection  clause, an  agreement to arbitrate  does not\n\ndeprive  a  federal  court   of  its  jurisdiction  over  the\n\nunderlying dispute.
