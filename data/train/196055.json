Appellant  Zyrone  Cooper  filed  a\r                                 \n\ncomplaint in  Maine's federal  district court  concerning the\n\nconditions  of his tenancy in the Glenridge Apartments, a 24-\n\napartment complex which receives federal funds.  Cooper  sued\n\nTerry Shortt, the site manager, Ray McNeal, a  representative\n\nof Realty Resources Management (the agent for Glenridge), and\n\nthree tenants (collectively, \"appellees\").\n\n          Cooper  alleged that  the  appellees  conspired  to\n\nprohibit him  from  the  full  enjoyment  of  his  apartment.\n\nSpecifically,  he  stated  that  the tenants  made  excessive\n\nnoise.  When Cooper complained to Shortt, Shortt called him a\n\n\"nigger\"  and refused to believe Cooper's story.  Shortt also\n\nthreatened to  evict Cooper, refused  to fix his  toilet, and\n\nentered his  apartment when  Cooper  was not  there.   Cooper\n\nclaims  that the actions of  the appellees were  based on his\n\nrace, mental handicap and age.\n\n          The court  granted  IFP  status  to  Cooper  but  a\n\nmagistrate  judge recommended the  dismissal of the complaint\n\nunder 28  U.S.C.   1915(d).   The magistrate  judge construed\n\nthe  complaint as attempting to state a claim under 42 U.S.C.\n\n  1983.1   He then found that  the appellees were not  acting\n\nunder  color of  state  law.   Thus,  he concluded  that  the\n\ncomplaint lacked any  arguable factual basis.   The  district\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Cooper  only  cited  18 U.S.C.      241  and  242 in  the\ncomplaint.  \"Generally, a private citizen has no authority to\ninitiate a federal criminal  prosecution.\"  Cok v. Cosentino,\r                                                                        \n876 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1989) (per curiam).  Also,    241 and\n242 do not provide for a civil action for damages.  Id.\r                                                                   \r\r\n\ncourt  judge accepted  the  magistrate's  recommendation  and\n\ndismissed the complaint.  This appeal ensued.\n\n          A district  court may dismiss  a complaint pursuant\n\nto    1915(d) if \"the action is  frivolous or malicious.\"  An\n\naction is frivolous \"where it  lacks an arguable basis either\n\nin law or  in fact.\"  Neitzke v. Williams,  490 U.S. 319, 325\r                                                     \n\n(1989).  Thus,   1915(d)\n\n          accords judges not only the  authority to\n          dismiss  a claim based on an indisputably\n          meritless  legal  theory,  but  also  the\n          unusual power  to pierce the veil  of the\n          complaint's   factual   allegations   and\n          dismiss   those   claims  whose   factual\n          contentions    are   clearly    baseless.\n          Examples of the  former class are  claims\n          against  which  it   is  clear  that  the\n          defendants  are  immune  from   suit  and\n          claims   of   infringement  of   a  legal\n          interest which clearly  does not exist. .\n          . .\n\nId. at 327 (citation omitted).\r               \n\n          While we agree with  the district court that Cooper\n\ncannot  state  a     1983 claim,  his  complaint  nonetheless\n\nconcerns   neither   \"clearly    baseless\"   facts   nor   an\n\n\"undisputably meritless legal theory.\"   Cooper alleges  that\n\nappellees  discriminated against  him based  on his  race and\n\nbecause he is  handicapped.  Discrimination in  the rental of\n\nproperty  is prohibited by the  Civil Rights Act  of 1866, 42\n\nU.S.C.    1982 (race), and the  Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C.  \n\n3604 (race and handicap).  Both statutes permit  an aggrieved\n\nperson to sue private parties.  See, e.g., City of Memphis v.\r                                                                      \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nGreene, 451 U.S. 100, 120 (1981) (  1982); Curtis v. Loether,\r                                                                        \n\n415  U.S. 189, 190 (1974) (  3604).  Whether Cooper's sparse,\n\nrather conclusory allegations  ultimately will support claims\n\nbased on   1982 and   3604 is a matter on which we express no\n\nopinion.   We only hold  that, giving Cooper  \"the benefit of\n\nall  the suggested facts and . . . indulg[ing] all reasonable\n\ninferences  in  his  favor,\" the  complaint  should  proceed.\n\nJohnson v.  Rodriguez,  943 F.2d  104, 107  (1st Cir.  1991),\r                                 \n\ncert. denied, 112 S.Ct. 948 (1992).  See also Street v. Fair,\r                                                                        \n\n918 F.2d 269, 273 (1st Cir. 1990) (per curiam) (a complaint's\n\nfactual deficiencies do not make it frivolous).  \n\n          We therefore  vacate the  judgment of the  district\r                                          \n\ncourt  and   remand  the   matter  for   further  proceedings\r                               \n\nconsistent with this opinion.2\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  We  appreciate  that the  complaint  mentions  neither 42\nU.S.C.    1982 nor  42 U.S.C.    3604;  but, as  the district\ncourt  recognized,  the complaint  was filed  pro se  and the\r                                                                \ncourt, therefore,  had to look  beyond its face  to determine\nwhether  it was  frivolous.   Here, the  judge looked  in the\nwrong direction.\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
