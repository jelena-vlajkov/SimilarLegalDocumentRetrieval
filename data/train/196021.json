Because we  agree, for the most\n\npart, with  the magistrate judge's thoughtful  opinion, see Bloom\r                                                                           \n\nv.  Agfa Corp., No. 90-10856-ZRK,  1994 WL 548050  (D. Mass. Aug.\r                        \n\n10, 1994),  we affirm  the judgment  below  substantially on  the\n\nbasis of that opinion.  We add only two brief comments.\n\n          First,   plaintiff  concedes  that   if  his  proffered\n\n\"statistical evidence\"  lacked probative  force, he had  no other\n\ncompetent  proof of an age-based  animus.  On  reflection, we are\n\npersuaded that this evidence is not evidence at all.  To say that\n\na reduction  in force discriminated against  older workers merely\n\nbecause 60% of the managers who were laid off were  over 40 years\n\nof age proves nothing of consequence about  age discrimination in\n\nthe absence of complementary  evidence as to the ages  of all the\n\nmanagers employed in  the unit  under analysis.   See LeBlanc  v.\r                                                                       \n\nGreat Am. Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 848  (1st Cir. 1993) (noting in a\r                            \n\ndisparate  treatment case  that appellant's  statistical evidence\n\nwas flawed inasmuch as it failed to provide important information\n\nanent  the applicant pool), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1398 (1994).\r                                                  \n\n          We think this proposition has particular cogency where,\n\nas  here, logic suggests that the universe of managers might well\n\nbe weighted toward the  protected class.  After all,  on average,\n\none  would  expect  managers   in  a  large  corporation   to  be\n\nexperienced  hands and, thus,  older rather than  younger.  Given\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nthis  logical  expectation,   plaintiff's  incomplete   equation,\n\nwithout  more, does not supply a sufficient predicate on which to\n\nfound a reasonable inference of age-based animus.\n\n          Second,  we  do not  believe  that  the district  court\n\nabused  its discretion  in  denying plaintiff's  tardy motion  to\n\ncompel discovery.   See generally  Mack v. Great Atl.  &amp; Pac. Tea\r                                                                           \n\nCo.,  871 F.2d 179, 186 (1st Cir. 1989) (discussing trial court's\r             \n\nbroad  discretion in respect to discovery orders).  Plaintiff let\n\nthree years lapse after  the court denied his original  motion to\n\ncompel without  prejudice, and only renewed the  motion after the\n\ncase had been reached  for trial.  Parties who, like  Bloom, have\n\neasily foreseeable needs for pretrial discovery cannot wait until\n\nthe  district  court  is  performing rites  of  interment  before\n\nattempting to secure necessary  facts.  See, e.g., Fusco  v. Gen.\r                                                                           \n\nMotors  Corp., 11  F.3d  259,  266  (1st  Cir.  1993)  (affirming\r                       \n\ndistrict  court's denial  of appellant's  eve-of-trial motion  to\n\ncompel  production  when  appellant  knew  a  year  earlier  that\n\nappellee intended  to offer evidence  on the issue);  Medeiros v.\r                                                                        \n\nUnited  States,  621 F.2d  468,  470 (1st  Cir.  1980) (affirming\r                        \n\ndismissal   for  lack   of  prosecution  when   record  reflected\n\n\"unreasonable   delay\"  by   plaintiff  in   conducting  pretrial\n\ndiscovery).  In  this instance, plaintiff's effort was too little\n\ntoo late.\n\n          We need go no further.  It is clear beyond peradventure\n\nthat the trial court did not err either  in ordering judgment for\n\nthe  defendant as  a  matter of law  based on plaintiff's opening\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nstatement  or in  denying  plaintiff's belated  motion to  reopen\n\ndiscovery.  Because  this appeal  does  not  yield a  substantial\n\nquestion  of law or fact, we summarily affirm the judgment below.\n\nSee 1st Cir.
