The district  court held the defense timely  and, ruling\r\n\nthat it applied to appellant's  conduct, entered judgment for the\r\n\nappellees.  On appeal, this court considered that  the timeliness\r\n\nissue turned on whether the short statutes of limitation found in\r\n\nNew Hampshire Rev. Stat. Ann. sections 677:2 and  :4 apply in the\r\n\ncircumstances  of this case.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court has\r\n\nnow responded in the negative when that question was certified to\r\n\nit.  The  New Hampshire  Supreme Court ruled  that the  questions\r\n\npresented by  this case --  questions of an  ordinance's legality\r\n\nand  ultimately the binding effect  of a promissory  note -- were\r\n\nnot questions of  administrative action subject to  RSA 677:2 and\r\n\n:4,  but were  affirmative  defenses relating  to the  underlying\r\n\nlegality of the appellant's legislative action.\r\n\n          In light of  the opinion  of the Supreme  Court of  New\r\n\nHampshire,  we hold  that the  district court's judgment  for the\r\n\nappellee must be affirmed.\r                                   \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n",
