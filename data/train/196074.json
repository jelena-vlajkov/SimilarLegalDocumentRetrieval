Appellant Jose A. Ortiz  Casanova, acting\r                           \n\npro se,  moved  to vacate,  modify  or correct  his  sentence\r                  \n\npursuant  to  28 U.S.C.    2255.    Ortiz maintains  that the\n\ndistrict  court erred  in dismissing  all his  claims without\n\nconducting an  evidentiary hearing concerning whether (1) the\n\nsentence imposed  failed to take into  account the Sentencing\n\nReform  Act of  1984, (2)  the assessment  of a  $50,000 fine\n\nviolated due process and equal protection of the law, (3) the\n\nplea-taking procedure was constitutionally defective, (4) his\n\ncounsel   was  constitutionally   inadequate,  and   (5)  the\n\ngovernment   breached  the  plea   agreement  at  sentencing.\n\nAssuming,  without deciding,  that these  challenges  are all\n\ncognizable  in  a    2255  proceeding, see  Knight  v. United\r                                                                         \n\nStates, 37 F.3d 769, 772-74 (1st Cir. 1994), we find no error\r                  \n\nand affirm. \n\n                          BACKGROUND\n\n     On October 1, 1987, Ortiz  and a co-defendant, the  sole\n\noccupants  of a boat found  to contain 195  kilos of cocaine,\n\nwere  arrested.   Subsequently,  both  were  indicted on  two\n\ncounts of cocaine importation  and distribution charges.  See\r                                                                         \n\nUnited States v. Palmer-Contreras, 835  F.2d 15, 16 (1st Cir.\r                                             \n\n1987)  (setting  out  background  and   affirming  denial  of\n\npretrial bail).  Ortiz  petitioned to enter a plea  of guilty\n\nto one count and  executed a written plea agreement  with the\n\ngovernment.  A change-of-plea hearing was held on January 26,\r\r\n\n1988.   The  plea was  accepted, and  Ortiz was  convicted of\n\naiding and abetting the  possession with intent to distribute\n\ncocaine under  21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1) and  18 U.S.C.    2, in\n\nviolation  of    1002  of the  Anti-Drug  Abuse Act  of  1986\n\n(\"ADAA\"), Pub. L. No. 99-570 (Oct.  26, 1986).1  On April  6,\n\n1988, Ortiz was sentenced  to twenty-five years imprisonment,\n\nfive years  of supervised release, a  $50,000 stand-committed\n\nfine, and a $50 special assessment.  After various motions by\n\nOrtiz  for correction  of  sentence, the  district court,  on\n\nJanuary  25,  1990, reduced  his term  of imprisonment  to 18\n\nyears.   Further motions to modify the sentence and fine were\n\nunsuccessful.   Ortiz'  direct  appeal  from  conviction  and\n\nsentence was  ultimately dismissed by this court  for lack of\n\nprosecution.\n\n     (1)  The Sentence.\r                 (1)              \n\n     Ortiz  contends  that  he  should  have  been  sentenced\n\naccording to the guidelines promulgated under the  Sentencing\n\nReform  Act of  1984.   The  guidelines  became operative  on\n\nNovember 1, 1987 and,  it is manifestly clear, apply  only to\n\noffenses  committed on or  after that date  regardless of the\n\ndate of  conviction or sentencing.   Sentencing Act  of 1987,\n\nPub. L.  No. 100-182 (Dec. 7,  1987); 18 U.S.C.    3551 note;\n\nsee  United States v. Twomey,  845 F.2d 1132,  1135 (1st Cir.\r                                        \n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  The increased penalties, supervised release and no-parole\nprovisions  of  the  ADAA  became  effective  upon enactment.\nGozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U.S. 395, 401-09 (1991).\r                                          \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n1988); see also United  States v. Metallo, 908 F.2d  795, 800\r                                                     \n\n(11th Cir.  1990).   Because Ortiz was  convicted of  conduct\n\nthat occurred  in October 1987, the  sentencing guidelines do\n\nnot apply, and he was properly sentenced under pre-guidelines\n\nlaw.  United States v. Richard,  943 F.2d 115, 120 (1st  Cir.\r                                          \n\n1991); United States  v. Thomas,  895 F.2d 51,  58 (1st  Cir.\r                                           \n\n1990).   There  is no  constitutional right  to  benefit from\n\nsentencing guidelines that put into  effect lesser punishment\n\nlevels  for a  crime after  the offense  was committed.   See\r                                                                         \n\nUnited States v.  Hayes, 929 F.2d  741, 742 (D.C.Cir.  1991).\r                                   \n\nOrtiz'  argument that  it  is inconsistent  to fix  different\n\neffective dates  for penalty provisions  of the ADDA  and the\n\nSentencing Reform  Act of 1984 was expressly  rejected by the\n\nSupreme  Court in  Gozlon-Peretz v.  United States,  498 U.S.\r                                                              \n\n395, 405-09 (1991).  Otherwise, Ortiz does not argue that the\n\nsentence   imposed  was  not   within  statutory   limits  or\n\nconstituted cruel  and unusual punishment.   See Richard, 943\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d at 120.  The sentencing guidelines were never applicable\n\nto Ortiz and he was properly sentenced under the ADAA.\n\n     (2)  The Fine.\r                 (2)          \n\n     Ortiz argues  that the  imposition of  a stand-committed\n\nfine of  $50,000 is unjustified and exorbitant  because he is\n\nindigent.   This claim is premature.  Ortiz must first pursue\n\navailable  administrative  remedies   designed  to   evaluate\n\ninability to pay a fine, 18 U.S.C.   3569; Santiago v. United\r                                                                         \n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nStates,  889  F.2d 371,  372-73 (1st  Cir.  1989), and  he is\r                  \n\nwithout  standing to  contest his  fine on  indigency grounds\n\nuntil  and  unless  the  government  seeks  incarceration for\n\nnonpayment.  See  United States  v. Levy, 897  F.2d 596,  598\r                                                    \n\n(1st  Cir. 1990).  The mere existence of an outstanding penal\n\nliability  does not  violate an  indigent prisoner's  rights.\n\nUnited States v. Rivera-Velez, 839 F.2d 8 (1st Cir. 1988).\r                                         \n\n     (3)  The Plea.\r                 (3)          \n\n     Ortiz  first  maintains  that  the  plea   colloquy  was\n\ndefective because  the court failed to  determine that Ortiz,\n\nin entering the plea change, heavily relied on his attorney's\n\nrepresentation  that he would receive no more than a ten year\n\nsentence and would have  to serve six years and  eight months\n\nat  most.    However,  the  facts  recited  in  Ortiz'   2255\n\nmemoranda,  his  attached affidavit,  the plea  petition, the\n\nparties  plea  agreement,  and  the  declarations  of  Ortiz'\n\nattorney  and his  codefendant's  attorney2 do  not, overall,\n\npresent enough evidence  to overcome the  presumed regularity\n\nof the  plea proceeding.  These  record documents effectively\n\ncontradict Ortiz'  assertion that  he was falsely  assured by\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  Ortiz'  complaints about  his  attorney are  vague as  to\nwhich attorney  represented him.   Early on,  both defendants\nwere represented by Abreu.  It is clear that Lima assumed the\nrepresentation of Ortiz about six weeks  before the change of\nplea  proceeding.    Ortiz'  affidavit  indicates  that  both\nattorneys visited  him, and, presumably,  his codefendant, in\nprison prior to the plea change.\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nhis  attorney  that  a guilty  plea  would  garner a  lighter\n\nsentence.\n\n     Ortiz next complains that  he relied upon his attorney's\n\nrepresentation  that he  would be  eligible for  parole after\n\nserving one-third of  his sentence and that  the court failed\n\nto  reveal to him that  his offense was  nonparolable.  Ortiz\n\nrelies on Durant  v. United  States, 410 F.2d  689, 693  (1st\r                                               \n\nCir. 1969), which held  that a defendant must be  informed of\n\nparole ineligibility.   However, the 1974  Amendments to Fed.\n\nR. Cr. P. 11 make clear that, in accepting a  plea of guilty,\n\na court is not required to inform a defendant of the possible\n\ncollateral consequences  of a  guilty plea such  as statutory\n\nineligibility for parole.  Johnson v. United States, 650 F.2d\r                                                               \n\n1, 4 (1st  Cir. 1981);  see Rule 11(c)(1)  Notes of  Advisory\r                                       \n\nCommittee on Rules; see  also United States v. Fox,  941 F.2d\r                                                              \n\n480,  486  (7th Cir.  1991);  United  States v.  Sanclemente-\r                                                                         \n\nBejarano,  861  F.2d  206,  209  (9th  Cir.  1988).    Ortiz'\r                    \n\nassertion that  no  one  mentioned  parole  ineligibility  is\n\npatently  inadequate   to  set  aside  his   guilty  plea  on\n\nconstitutional  grounds.   See United  States v.  Garcia, 698\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d  31, 33 (1st Cir.  1983) (due process  not offended when\n\nparole eligibility advice omitted in plea-taking).\n\n     (4)  Ineffective Assistance.\r                 (4)                        \n\n     Ortiz  charges that  his  attorney rendered  ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel during  the plea negotiation process by\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nmisrepresenting   to  him   his   eligibility   for   parole.\n\nSpecifically, Ortiz  alleges that  his lawyer induced  him to\n\nplead guilty by  telling him  that he would  be eligible  for\n\nparole  after serving approximately one-third of his sentence\n\nand that  the sentence  imposed would  not exceed  ten years.\n\nBut for  those representations,  Ortiz insists that  he would\n\nnot have pleaded guilty.   \n\n     Challenges  to  guilty  pleas  based on  allegations  of\n\nineffective assistance of counsel during the plea process are\n\nevaluated under the familiar two-pronged cause and  prejudice\n\ntest of Strickland  v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,  687-88, 694\r                                             \n\n(1984).  Hill v. Lockhart, 474  U.S. 52, 58 (1985).  The plea\r                                     \n\npetition  and  plea   agreement  contradict  Ortiz'   belated\n\nassertions that he was assured a specific sentence, as do the\n\nattorneys'  declarations  that   no  promise,  prediction  or\n\nrepresentation  concerning  parole eligibility  or sentencing\n\nwere made.  Allegations  based solely on counsel's inaccurate\n\npredictions about sentencing  are insufficient to  sustain an\n\nineffective assistance  claim.   Knight v. United  States, 37\r                                                                     \n\nF.3d  at 775; Worthen v.  Meachum, 842 F.2d  1179, 1184 (10th\r                                             \n\nCir. 1988) (attorney's \"bad  guess\" regarding parole does not\n\nrender   plea   involuntary).     Ortiz'   unadorned  factual\n\nallegation  that his  attorney  misled him  as  to parole  is\n\nsimply   inadequate  to   warrant  an   evidentiary  hearing.\n\nHernandez-Hernandez v. United States,  904 F.2d 758, 762 (1st\r                                                \n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nCir. 1990) (to  obtain hearing,  highly specific  allegations\n\nusually   accompanied   by   independent  corroboration   are\n\nrequired).  \n\n     Even  if   Ortiz  could  satisfy  the   cause  prong  of\n\nStrickland's test, he has  failed to sufficiently allege that\r                      \n\nhe was prejudiced  by the alleged error.   Hill, 474 U.S.  at\r                                                           \n\n60.   To establish  prejudice, Ortiz  must show a  reasonable\n\nprobability that, armed with correct information, the outcome\n\nwould have  been different.   Strickland,  466  U.S. at  694.\r                                                    \n\nOrtiz' bare and  conclusory statement  that if  he had  known\n\nthat  his offense was nonparolable, he would not have pleaded\n\nguilty and would have  gone to trial is insufficient  to show\n\nprejudice.  See Armstead v. Scott, 37 F.3d 202, 210 (5th Cir.\r                                             \n\n1994); Barker v.  United States,  7 F.3d 629,  633 (7th  Cir.\r                                           \n\n1993); United States v. Hanley, 906 F.2d 1116, 1121 (6th Cir.\r                                          \n\n1990).  Ortiz does not maintain that he was told  he would be\n\neligible for parole  only if  he pleaded guilty,  nor has  he\n\notherwise  indicated any  \"special circumstances\"  that might\n\nsupport a reasonable inference  that parole was  particularly\n\nimportant.  Hill, 474 U.S. at 60.  As Ortiz acknowledges, his\r                            \n\noffense  is  nonparolable.   Ortiz'  misunderstanding  as  to\n\nparole eligibility appears equally applicable either to going\n\nto trial or pleading guilty.  See Smith v.

Ortiz Casanova, acting pro se, moved to vacate, modify or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255.  Ortiz maintains that the district court erred in dismissing all his claims without conducting an evidentiary hearing concerning whether (1) the sentence imposed failed to take into account the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, (2) the assessment of a $50,000 fine violated due process and equal protection of the law, (3) the plea-taking procedure was constitutionally defective, (4) his counsel was constitutionally inadequate, and (5) the government breached the plea agreement at sentencing.  Assuming, without deciding, that these challenges are all cognizable in a Sec. 2255 proceeding, see Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d 769, 772-74 (1st Cir. 1994), we find no error and affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 1, 1987, Ortiz and a co-defendant, the sole occupants of a boat found to contain 195 kilos of cocaine, were arrested.  Subsequently, both were indicted on two counts of cocaine importation and distribution charges.  See United States v. Palmer-Contreras, 835 F.2d 15, 16 (1st Cir. 1987) (setting out background and affirming denial of pretrial bail).  Ortiz petitioned to enter a plea of guilty to one count and executed a written plea agreement with the government.  A change-of-plea hearing was held on January 26, 1988.  The plea was accepted, and Ortiz was convicted of aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute cocaine under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2, in violation of Sec. 1002 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (\"ADAA\"), Pub. L. No. 99-570 (Oct. 26, 1986).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  On April 6, 1988, Ortiz was sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment, five years of supervised release, a $50,000 stand-committed fine, and a $50 special assessment.  After various motions by Ortiz for correction of sentence, the district court, on January 25, 1990, reduced his term of imprisonment to 18 years.  Further motions to modify the sentence and fine were unsuccessful.  Ortiz' direct appeal from conviction and sentence was ultimately dismissed by this court for lack of prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>(1) The Sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz contends that he should have been sentenced according to the guidelines promulgated under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.  The guidelines became operative on November 1, 1987 and, it is manifestly clear, apply only to offenses committed on or after that date regardless of the date of conviction or sentencing.  Sentencing Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-182 (Dec. 7, 1987);  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3551 note;  see United States v. Twomey, 845 F.2d 1132, 1135 (1st Cir. 1988);  see also United States v. Metallo, 908 F.2d 795, 800 (11th Cir. 1990).  Because Ortiz was convicted of conduct that occurred in October 1987, the sentencing guidelines do not apply, and he was properly sentenced under pre-guidelines law.  United States v. Richard, 943 F.2d 115, 120 (1st Cir. 1991);  United States v. Thomas, 895 F.2d 51, 58 (1st Cir. 1990).  There is no constitutional right to benefit from sentencing guidelines that put into effect lesser punishment levels for a crime after the offense was committed.  See United States v. Hayes, 929 F.2d 741, 742 (D.C.Cir. 1991).  Ortiz' argument that it is inconsistent to fix different effective dates for penalty provisions of the ADDA and the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 was expressly rejected by the Supreme Court in Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U.S. 395, 405-09 (1991).  Otherwise, Ortiz does not argue that the sentence imposed was not within statutory limits or constituted cruel and unusual punishment.  See Richard, 943 F.2d at 120.  The sentencing guidelines were never applicable to Ortiz and he was properly sentenced under the ADAA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>(2) The Fine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz argues that the imposition of a stand-committed fine of $50,000 is unjustified and exorbitant because he is indigent.  This claim is premature.  Ortiz must first pursue available administrative remedies designed to evaluate inability to pay a fine, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3569;  Santiago v. United States, 889 F.2d 371, 372-73 (1st Cir. 1989), and he is without standing to contest his fine on indigency grounds until and unless the government seeks incarceration for nonpayment.  See United States v. Levy, 897 F.2d 596, 598 (1st Cir. 1990).  The mere existence of an outstanding penal liability does not violate an indigent prisoner's rights.  United States v. Rivera-Velez, 839 F.2d 8 (1st Cir. 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>(3) The Plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz first maintains that the plea colloquy was defective because the court failed to determine that Ortiz, in entering the plea change, heavily relied on his attorney's representation that he would receive no more than a ten year sentence and would have to serve six years and eight months at most.  However, the facts recited in Ortiz' Sec. 2255 memoranda, his attached affidavit, the plea petition, the parties plea agreement, and the declarations of Ortiz' attorney and his codefendant's attorney<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> do not, overall, present enough evidence to overcome the presumed regularity of the plea proceeding.  These record documents effectively contradict Ortiz' assertion that he was falsely assured by his attorney that a guilty plea would garner a lighter sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz next complains that he relied upon his attorney's representation that he would be eligible for parole after serving one-third of his sentence and that the court failed to reveal to him that his offense was nonparolable.  Ortiz relies on Durant v. United States, 410 F.2d 689, 693 (1st Cir. 1969), which held that a defendant must be informed of parole ineligibility.  However, the 1974 Amendments to Fed.  R. Cr. P. 11 make clear that, in accepting a plea of guilty, a court is not required to inform a defendant of the possible collateral consequences of a guilty plea such as statutory ineligibility for parole.  Johnson v. United States, 650 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1981);  see Rule 11(c)(1) Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules;  see also United States v. Fox, 941 F.2d 480, 486 (7th Cir. 1991);  United States v. Sanclemente-Bejarano, 861 F.2d 206, 209 (9th Cir. 1988).  Ortiz' assertion that no one mentioned parole ineligibility is patently inadequate to set aside his guilty plea on constitutional grounds.  See United States v. Garcia, 698 F.2d 31, 33 (1st Cir. 1983) (due process not offended when parole eligibility advice omitted in plea-taking).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>(4) Ineffective Assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz charges that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel during the plea negotiation process by misrepresenting to him his eligibility for parole.  Specifically, Ortiz alleges that his lawyer induced him to plead guilty by telling him that he would be eligible for parole after serving approximately one-third of his sentence and that the sentence imposed would not exceed ten years.  But for those representations, Ortiz insists that he would not have pleaded guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Challenges to guilty pleas based on allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel during the plea process are evaluated under the familiar two-pronged cause and prejudice test of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 694 (1984).  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 58 (1985).  The plea petition and plea agreement contradict Ortiz' belated assertions that he was assured a specific sentence, as do the attorneys' declarations that no promise, prediction or representation concerning parole eligibility or sentencing were made.  Allegations based solely on counsel's inaccurate predictions about sentencing are insufficient to sustain an ineffective assistance claim.  Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d at 775;  Worthen v. Meachum, 842 F.2d 1179, 1184 (10th Cir. 1988) (attorney's \"bad guess\" regarding parole does not render plea involuntary).  Ortiz' unadorned factual allegation that his attorney misled him as to parole is simply inadequate to warrant an evidentiary hearing.  Hernandez-Hernandez v. United States, 904 F.2d 758, 762 (1st Cir. 1990) (to obtain hearing, highly specific allegations usually accompanied by independent corroboration are required).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Ortiz could satisfy the cause prong of Strickland 's test, he has failed to sufficiently allege that he was prejudiced by the alleged error.  Hill, 474 U.S. at 60.  To establish prejudice, Ortiz must show a reasonable probability that, armed with correct information, the outcome would have been different.  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.  Ortiz' bare and conclusory statement that if he had known that his offense was nonparolable, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have gone to trial is insufficient to show prejudice.  See Armstead v. Scott, 37 F.3d 202, 210 (5th Cir. 1994);  Barker v. United States, 7 F.3d 629, 633 (7th Cir. 1993);  United States v. Hanley, 906 F.2d 1116, 1121 (6th Cir. 1990).  Ortiz does not maintain that he was told he would be eligible for parole only if he pleaded guilty, nor has he otherwise indicated any \"special circumstances\" that might support a reasonable inference that parole was particularly important.  Hill, 474 U.S. at 60.  As Ortiz acknowledges, his offense is nonparolable.  Ortiz' misunderstanding as to parole eligibility appears equally applicable either to going to trial or pleading guilty.  See Smith v. McCotter, 786 F.2d 697, 703 (5th Cir. 1986);  see also Wellman v. Maine, 962 F.2d 70, 73 (1st Cir. 1992).  Since parole was not in play in either eventuality, Ortiz \"failed to allege the kind of prejudice from the allegedly incompetent advice of counsel that would have entitled him to a hearing.\"  Hill, 474 U.S. at 53.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>(5) Breach of Plea Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz' last foray-that the government breached the plea agreement-is frivolous.  Ortiz maintains that the government violated the letter and the spirit of the plea agreement by appending to the presentence report a letter indicating that the estimated wholesale value of the cocaine seized was between 6 and 6.5 million dollars.  The government had a duty to bring all relevant conduct information to the court's attention, and, in so doing, did not violate the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, a Sec. 2255 petition is presented to the judge who presided over all the prior proceedings, the judge may take into account the knowledge gleaned during the previous proceedings without convening an additional hearing.  United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir. 1993).  The district court properly rejected Ortiz' motion for Sec. 2255 relief based upon the papers of record and the court's familiarity with the case.

The sentencing guidelines were never applicable to Ortiz and he was properly sentenced under the ADAA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>(2) The Fine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz argues that the imposition of a stand-committed fine of $50,000 is unjustified and exorbitant because he is indigent.  This claim is premature.  Ortiz must first pursue available administrative remedies designed to evaluate inability to pay a fine, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3569;  Santiago v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532030\"><a href=\"/opinion/532030/ariel-santiago-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 372-73 (1st Cir. 1989), and he is without standing to contest his fine on indigency grounds until and unless the government seeks incarceration for nonpayment.  See United States v. Levy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537617\"><a href=\"/opinion/537617/united-states-v-timothy-alexander-levy/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span>, 598 (1st Cir. 1990).  The mere existence of an outstanding penal liability does not violate an indigent prisoner's rights.  United States v. Rivera-Velez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"501697\"><a href=\"/opinion/501697/united-states-v-jose-rivera-velez-aka-cheo/\"><span class=\"volume\">839</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>(3) The Plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz first maintains that the plea colloquy was defective because the court failed to determine that Ortiz, in entering the plea change, heavily relied on his attorney's representation that he would receive no more than a ten year sentence and would have to serve six years and eight months at most.  However, the facts recited in Ortiz' Sec. 2255 memoranda, his attached affidavit, the plea petition, the parties plea agreement, and the declarations of Ortiz' attorney and his codefendant's attorney<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> do not, overall, present enough evidence to overcome the presumed regularity of the plea proceeding.  These record documents effectively contradict Ortiz' assertion that he was falsely assured by his attorney that a guilty plea would garner a lighter sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz next complains that he relied upon his attorney's representation that he would be eligible for parole after serving one-third of his sentence and that the court failed to reveal to him that his offense was nonparolable.  Ortiz relies on Durant v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"284723\"><a href=\"/opinion/284723/william-r-durant-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span>, 693 (1st Cir. 1969), which held that a defendant must be informed of parole ineligibility.  However, the 1974 Amendments to Fed.  R. Cr. P. 11 make clear that, in accepting a plea of guilty, a court is not required to inform a defendant of the possible collateral consequences of a guilty plea such as statutory ineligibility for parole.  Johnson v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"390896\"><a href=\"/opinion/390896/paul-e-johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">650</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir. 1981);  see Rule 11(c)(1) Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules;  see also United States v.

Ortiz' assertion that no one mentioned parole ineligibility is patently inadequate to set aside his guilty plea on constitutional grounds.  See United States v. Garcia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"413301\"><a href=\"/opinion/413301/united-states-v-angeles-ramonita-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">698</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir. 1983) (due process not offended when parole eligibility advice omitted in plea-taking).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>(4) Ineffective Assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz charges that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel during the plea negotiation process by misrepresenting to him his eligibility for parole.  Specifically, Ortiz alleges that his lawyer induced him to plead guilty by telling him that he would be eligible for parole after serving approximately one-third of his sentence and that the sentence imposed would not exceed ten years.  But for those representations, Ortiz insists that he would not have pleaded guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Challenges to guilty pleas based on allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel during the plea process are evaluated under the familiar two-pronged cause and prejudice test of Strickland v. Washington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 687-88, 694 (1984).  Hill v.

The plea petition and plea agreement contradict Ortiz' belated assertions that he was assured a specific sentence, as do the attorneys' declarations that no promise, prediction or representation concerning parole eligibility or sentencing were made.  Allegations based solely on counsel's inaccurate predictions about sentencing are insufficient to sustain an ineffective assistance claim.  Knight v. United <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195690\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">States,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195690/knight-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span>;  Worthen v.

Ortiz' unadorned factual allegation that his attorney misled him as to parole is simply inadequate to warrant an evidentiary hearing.  Hernandez-Hernandez v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542854\"><a href=\"/opinion/542854/arnaldo-hernandez-hernandez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></a></span>, 762 (1st Cir. 1990) (to obtain hearing, highly specific allegations usually accompanied by independent corroboration are required).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Ortiz could satisfy the cause prong of Strickland 's test, he has failed to sufficiently allege that he was prejudiced by the alleged error.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111539\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hill,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111539/hill-v-lockhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>.  To establish prejudice, Ortiz must show a reasonable probability that, armed with correct information, the outcome would have been different.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Strickland,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span>.  Ortiz' bare and conclusory statement that if he had known that his offense was nonparolable, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have gone to trial is insufficient to show prejudice.  See Armstead v. Scott, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679554\"><a href=\"/opinion/679554/willie-d-armstead-v-wayne-scott-director-texas-department-of-criminal/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span>, 210 (5th Cir. 1994);  Barker v.

Ortiz does not maintain that he was told he would be eligible for parole only if he pleaded guilty, nor has he otherwise indicated any \"special circumstances\" that might support a reasonable inference that parole was particularly important.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111539\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hill,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111539/hill-v-lockhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>.  As Ortiz acknowledges, his offense is nonparolable.  Ortiz' misunderstanding as to parole eligibility appears equally applicable either to going to trial or pleading guilty.  See Smith v. McCotter, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"466478\"><a href=\"/opinion/466478/jimmy-f-smith-v-ol-mccotter-director-texas-department-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">786</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span>, 703 (5th Cir. 1986);  see also Wellman v.

Since parole was not in play in either eventuality, Ortiz \"failed to allege the kind of prejudice from the allegedly incompetent advice of counsel that would have entitled him to a hearing.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111539\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hill,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111539/hill-v-lockhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>(5) Breach of Plea Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz' last foray-that the government breached the plea agreement-is frivolous.  Ortiz maintains that the government violated the letter and the spirit of the plea agreement by appending to the presentence report a letter indicating that the estimated wholesale value of the cocaine seized was between 6 and 6.5 million dollars.  The government had a duty to bring all relevant conduct information to the court's attention, and, in so doing, did not violate the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, a Sec. 2255 petition is presented to the judge who presided over all the prior proceedings, the judge may take into account the knowledge gleaned during the previous proceedings without convening an additional hearing.

The district court properly rejected Ortiz' motion for Sec. 2255 relief based upon the papers of record and the court's familiarity with the case.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195053\"><a href=\"/opinion/195053/united-states-v-mcgill/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 225-26; </a></span> Rule 4(b), Rules Governing Sec. 2255 Proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The increased penalties, supervised release and no-parole provisions of the ADAA became effective upon enactment.
