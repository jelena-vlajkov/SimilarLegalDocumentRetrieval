We have  carefully reviewed  the parties'\r                            \n\nbriefs  and the  record on  appeal.   We affirm  the district\n\ncourt  judgment of  November  14, 1994,  essentially for  the\n\nreasons   stated  in   the  magistrate  judge's   report  and\n\nrecommendation,  dated August  30,  1994.   We  add only  the\n\nfollowing.\n\n     Contrary to plaintiff's  suggestion, the Americans  with\n\nDisabilities Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-336 (codified at 42\n\nU.S.C.    12101, et  seq.) (\"ADA\") does not  entitle him to a\n\nfree lawyer in a civil case.  Indeed, the ADA is not directed\n\nat the federal government at all.  See, e.g., Title II of the\r                                                        \n\nADA,  42  U.S.C.    12131  et  seq., (prohibiting  disability\n\ndiscrimination   by  instrumentalities  of  state  and  local\n\ngovernments).\n\n     In any event, the district court did not abuse its broad\n\ndiscretion  in denying plaintiff's  motion to appoint counsel\n\nin  this civil case.  Although plaintiff is legally blind, he\n\nwas  aided by  his father  in the  drafting of  the submitted\n\npapers.  Plaintiff's request  for appointed counsel was based\n\non the  not  uncommon plea  that,  as  a lay  person,  he  is\n\nunschooled in the  intricacies of the law.   Nonetheless, the\n\npapers  demonstrated an  ability  to research  and argue  the\n\nmerits of his cause.   His impaired vision did  not adversely\n\nimpact his  ability to represent  himself.  In  addition, the\n\nmerits  of the case and  the relatively non-complex nature of\r\r\n\nthe   legal   issues   did   not  present   the   exceptional\n\ncircumstances which would warrant the appointment of counsel.\n\nSee DesRosiers v. Moran,  949 F.2d 15, 23-24 (1st  Cir. 1991)\r                                   \n\n(outlining  the considerations  underlying  the  decision  to\n\nappoint counsel in civil cases).\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
