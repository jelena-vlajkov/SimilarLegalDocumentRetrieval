The  crux of  appellant's\n\nargument  is that  the  bankruptcy court  erred in  resolving\n\nagainst  her the  fact-dominated liability  issues underlying\n\nher claims  of misrepresentation,  fraud and deceit.   Having\n\ncarefully reviewed  the briefs  and relevant portions  of the\n\nrecord in this six-day bench trial, we find no clear error in\n\nthe bankruptcy court's factual  findings and no suggestion of\n\nlegal error.

The parties' briefs join issue on the applicable standard\nof review in this court following the district court's review\nunder Bankruptcy Rule 8013.
