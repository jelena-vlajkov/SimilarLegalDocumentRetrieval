Plaintiff  Trevor Harper appeals the\n                    \n\ndismissal  of  his complaint  under 42  U.S.C.    1983.   The\n\ncomplaint  names as  the sole  defendant an  assistant clerk-\n\nmagistrate  of the  Cambridge, Massachusetts  District Court.\n\nIt  alleges  that  defendant  violated  the  constitution  by\n\nissuing  a search  warrant allowing  the Cambridge  police to\n\nopen  six  letters found  on  Harper's  person  when  he  was\n\narrested for assault with intent  to murder.  Harper  alleges\n\nthat  the affidavit submitted by the police in support of the\n\nsearch warrant \"clearly did not show probable cause to search\n\nand seize  . . . the  letters,\" as any \"ordinary  clerk would\n\nhave  .  .  .  known.\"   Therefore,  the  complaint  reasons,\n\nissuance  of  the warrant  constituted  \"maliciousness, bias,\n\nprejudice, and the intentional infliction of severe emotional\n\ndistress.\"\n\n          On a preliminary review  under 28 U.S.C.   1915(d),\n\nthe district court dismissed the complaint on the ground that\n\nthe defendant clerk is entitled to absolute immunity from a  \n\n1983  damages  suit  based  on  his actions  in  issuing  the\n\nwarrant.  We agree.  \n\n          \"Under current  legal theory, immunity  attaches or\n\ndoes  not  attach  depending  on  what  kind  of  action  was\n\nperformed rather than on  who performed it.\"  Acevedo-Cordero\n                                                             \n\nv.  Cordero-Santiago,  958  F.2d  20,  23  (1st  Cir.  1992).\n                    \n\nAbsolute immunity from  damages under    1983 is extended  to\n\ncourt officials other than  judges when the officials perform\n\njudicial functions  comparable to those that  would have been\n\naccorded absolute protection at common law.

The doctrine necessarily\n          \n\nprotects the authorized performance of \"paradigmatic judicial\n\nacts\" --  acts which  entail discretionary  decisionmaking in\n\nresolving disputes or adjudicating private rights.
