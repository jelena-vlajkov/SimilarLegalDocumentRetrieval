Plaintiff-appellant   Walter  Hodge\n                      \n\nappeals  the district court's  grant of defendant-appellees',\n\nAmerican Home  Assurance Co. and  Underwriter Adjustment Co.,\n\nmotion to dismiss with prejudice.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          Plaintiff  filed a  complaint on  October 3,  1989,\n\nalleging  that defendants  had  failed to  reimburse him  for\n\ndamages to  his insured property  resulting from a  series of\n\nearthquakes on the island  of St. Martin.   Defendants argued\n\nthat the damages  were the result of faulty  construction and\n\ntherefore exempt from coverage.\n\n          On the eve of the trial and almost four years after\n\nthe  date of  filing  of the  complaint,  defendants filed  a\n\nmotion in limine, seeking to disqualify plaintiff's liability\n                \n\nexpert for lack  of qualifications.   The motion was  granted\n\nand  thereafter, plaintiff's  counsel  sought to  withdraw as\n\ncounsel, claiming irreconcilable differences with his client.\n\nThis motion was denied and the trial began as scheduled.  \n\n          During opening  arguments,  in clear  disregard  of\n\nFed. R. Evid.  408, plaintiff's counsel referred  to an offer\n\nof  settlement  apparently   made  by   defendants.     After\n\nsustaining  defendants'  objection  and  warning  plaintiff's\n\ncounsel not  to refer  to settlement negotiations,  the court\n\ninstructed   the  jury   to   disregard   counsel's   remark.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nNotwithstanding the court's  admonition, plaintiff's  counsel\n\nresumed his opening  by telling the jury that  the defendants\n\nwere   unwilling  to   settle.     Defendants   objected  and\n\nimmediately moved for a mistrial.  After discussion with both\n\nparties,  the   court  declared   a  mistrial  and   informed\n\nplaintiff's  counsel that  \"Upon  request of  counsel I  will\n\nimpose  what I consider a  non resident bond,  to defray some\n\ncosts in this case.\"  Plaintiff's counsel did not object.\n\n          On May 10, 1993,  the court issued a written  order\n\nsetting forth its reasons  for declaring a mistrial.   In the\n\nsame order,  the court  also  granted defendants'  D.P.R.L.R.\n\n3041   motion requesting plaintiff post  a $3000 non-resident\n\n                    \n\n1.  D.P.R.L.R. 304 states, in relevant part, that:\n\n               When  the   plaintiff  is  domiciled\n          outside of  Puerto Rico  or is  a foreign\n          corporation, a bond  shall be required to\n          secure the costs, expenses and attorneys'\n          fees   which   may  be   awarded.     All\n          proceedings in  the action may  be stayed\n          until bond is posted,  which shall not be\n          less than $250.00.  The Court may require\n          an  additional bond  upon a  showing that\n          the  original  bond  is   not  sufficient\n          security, and may stay the proceedings in\n          the action until  such additional bond is\n          given.\n\n               After the  lapse of sixty  (60) days\n          from  the service of  the order requiring\n          bond  or  additional  bond, without  bond\n          having been posted, the Court may dismiss\n          the action.\n\n               This   rule   shall   be   liberally\n          interpreted in favor of the  plaintiff so\n          as not  to preclude  his or her  right to\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nbond \"to secure the costs, expenses and attorneys' fees which\n\nmay be awarded.\"     Plaintiff   neither   objected  to   nor\n\ncomplied with  this order.  Subsequently,  defendants filed a\n\nverified, detailed bill of costs in the amount of  $73,079.99\n\nfor  expenses   incurred  in  preparation  for  the  defense,\n\ntogether with  a motion  requesting the non-resident  bond be\n\nincreased to $50,000.   The court granted defendants' motion.\n\nAgain, plaintiff  neither objected to nor  complied with this\n\ncourt order.\n\n          After plaintiff had ignored the court's bond  order\n\nfor  sixty  days,  the  time prescribed  by  D.P.R.L.R.  304,\n\ndefendants moved  to dismiss the  action pursuant to  Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 41(b)2 and D.P.R.L.R. 304.\n\n                    \n\n          sue  through excessive  bond requirement.\n          Consistent with this, the Court, for good\n                                                   \n          cause  shown,  may  dispense   with  this\n                      \n          requirement. (emphasis supplied).\n\n2.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b) states:\n\n          (b)    Involuntary   Dismissal:    Effect\n          Thereof.  For failure of the plaintiff to\n          prosecute or  to comply with  these rules\n          or  any order of  court, a  defendant may\n          move for dismissal of an action or of any\n          claim against the  defendant.  Unless the\n          court   in   its   order  for   dismissal\n          otherwise  specified,  a dismissal  under\n          this  subdivision  and any  dismissal not\n          provided for in this  rule, other than  a\n          dismissal for lack  of jurisdiction,  for\n          improper venue, or for  failure to join a\n          party  under  Rule  19,  operates  as  an\n          adjudication upon the merits.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          On August 25, 1993, the court, in a lengthy written\n\norder,  dismissed the case with prejudice pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCiv.  P.  41(b)  citing,  inter  alia,  plaintiff's   extreme\n                                     \n\nmisconduct in failing to obey court orders and warnings.  The\n\nfollowing day, plaintiff's counsel,  who had not yet received\n\na copy of the  August 25, 1993 order, requested,  inter alia,\n                                                            \n\nan additional thirty  days to  post bond.   On September  20,\n\n1993,  the court issued  a separate order  restating that the\n\ncase was  dismissed with  prejudice as  of  August 25,  1993.\n\nFinally,  on September  22, 1993,  the court  formally denied\n\nplaintiff's  request for  additional time.    It is  from the\n\ncourt's judgment of dismissal  with prejudice that  plaintiff\n\nnow appeals. \n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          Plaintiff   avers   that  the   court   abused  its\n\ndiscretion  because  it  never  gave  consideration  to   the\n\nproblems that  had ensued  between plaintiff and  counsel and\n\nbecause the court never  considered plaintiff's inability  to\n\npay  the required bond.  The basis of plaintiff's argument is\n\nthat the  court should  have inferred  from his  motion filed\n\nAugust 26, 1993, the day after the court dismissed the action\n                              \n\nwith prejudice, that plaintiff was seeking a new attorney and\n\nthat he did  not have the finances  to pay the bond.   We are\n\nnot persuaded by either argument.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n          The parameters of Fed.  R. Civ. P. 41(b) dismissals\n\nare very clear:\n\n          Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of  Civil\n          Procedure expressly authorizes a district\n          court to dismiss a case \"[f]or failure of\n          the plaintiff to prosecute or comply with\n          .  . .  any order  of court.'

United\n                                                             \n\nStates, 7 F.3d 283, 284 (1st Cir. 1993).  \n      \n\n          We begin  by noting  that plaintiff has  waived any\n\ncomplaint he may  have with  the amount  of the  non-resident\n\nbond imposed  by the  court below.   A  review of the  record\n\nreveals  that each  of  the bond  orders  was issued  without\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nprejudice  to   either  party  to  request   an  increase  or\n\nreduction.   Nonetheless, plaintiff  neither objected  to the\n\nimposition  of the bonds nor  argued to the  court that there\n\nexisted circumstances  which  demanded  a  reduction  in  the\n\namount.   Rather, plaintiff silently ignored  the bond orders\n\nthereby  waiving his right to challenge them on appeal.3  See\n                                                             \n\nMcCoy v. Massachusetts Institute  of Technology, 950 F.3d 13,\n                                               \n\n22 (1st Cir.  1991) (\"It  is hornbook law  that theories  not\n\nraised squarely  in the district court cannot be surfaced for\n\nthe first time on appeal.\"). \n\n          Moreover, we are not concerned with the personality\n\nconflicts  that   may  have  existed  between  plaintiff  and\n\ncounsel.  Although  unfortunate for  the two men,  we do  not\n\nunderstand how  the fact  that there  may have  been friction\n\ncould possibly have prevented  the plaintiff from posting the\n\nrequired bond.\n\n          Finally, in light of plaintiff's repeated inability\n\nto  comply  with  court  warnings  and  court  orders,  i.e.,\n                                                            \n\n                    \n\n3.  Even  had we  not found  waiver, we see  no error  in the\ncourt's  orders.   As previously  held, when  reviewing Local\nRule  5,  D.P.R.C.R.  304's  predecessor,  the court  \"should\nconsider, upon proper motion, reducing the . . . minimum bond\n                            \nrequirement, or dispensing with it altogether . . . .\"  Hawes\n                                                             \nv.

Only  then  should  the  court\nconsider   \"ownership  by   a  nondomiciliary   plaintiff  of\nattachable  property  in  the  district,  the  likelihood  of\nsuccess  on the merits, the presence of a co-plaintiff who is\ndomiciled in the district, the probable length and complexity\nof  the litigation,  the conduct  of  the litigants,  and the\npurposes of the litigation.\"  Id.

Defendants argued that the damages were the result of faulty construction and therefore exempt from coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the eve of the trial and almost four years after the date of filing of the complaint, defendants filed a motion in limine, seeking to disqualify plaintiff's liability expert for lack of qualifications.  The motion was granted and thereafter, plaintiff's counsel sought to withdraw as counsel, claiming irreconcilable differences with his client.  This motion was denied and the trial began as scheduled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During opening arguments, in clear disregard of Fed.  R. Evid. 408, plaintiff's counsel referred to an offer of settlement apparently made by defendants.  After sustaining defendants' objection and warning plaintiff's counsel not to refer to settlement negotiations, the court instructed the jury to disregard counsel's remark.  Notwithstanding the court's admonition, plaintiff's counsel resumed his opening by telling the jury that the defendants were unwilling to settle.  Defendants objected and immediately moved for a mistrial.  After discussion with both parties, the court declared a mistrial and informed plaintiff's counsel that \"Upon request of counsel I will impose what I consider a non resident bond, to defray some costs in this case.\"  Plaintiff's counsel did not object.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 10, 1993, the court issued a written order setting forth its reasons for declaring a mistrial.  In the same order, the court also granted defendants' D.P.R.L.R. 304<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> motion requesting plaintiff post a $3000 non-resident bond \"to secure the costs, expenses and attorneys' fees which may be awarded.\"  Plaintiff neither objected to nor complied with this order.  Subsequently, defendants filed a verified, detailed bill of costs in the amount of $73,079.99 for expenses incurred in preparation for the defense, together with a motion requesting the non-resident bond be increased to $50,000.  The court granted defendants' motion.  Again, plaintiff neither objected to nor complied with this court order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After plaintiff had ignored the court's bond order for sixty days, the time prescribed by D.P.R.L.R. 304, defendants moved to dismiss the action pursuant to Fed.

R. Civ. P. 41(b) citing, inter alia, plaintiff's extreme misconduct in failing to obey court orders and warnings.  The following day, plaintiff's counsel, who had not yet received a copy of the August 25, 1993 order, requested, inter alia, an additional thirty days to post bond.  On September 20, 1993, the court issued a separate order restating that the case was dismissed with prejudice as of August 25, 1993.  Finally, on September 22, 1993, the court formally denied plaintiff's request for additional time.  It is from the court's judgment of dismissal with prejudice that plaintiff now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff avers that the court abused its discretion because it never gave consideration to the problems that had ensued between plaintiff and counsel and because the court never considered plaintiff's inability to pay the required bond.  The basis of plaintiff's argument is that the court should have inferred from his motion filed August 26, 1993, the day after the court dismissed the action with prejudice, that plaintiff was seeking a new attorney and that he did not have the finances to pay the bond.

A review of the record reveals that each of the bond orders was issued without prejudice to either party to request an increase or reduction.  Nonetheless, plaintiff neither objected to the imposition of the bonds nor argued to the court that there existed circumstances which demanded a reduction in the amount.  Rather, plaintiff silently ignored the bond orders thereby waiving his right to challenge them on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See McCoy v.
