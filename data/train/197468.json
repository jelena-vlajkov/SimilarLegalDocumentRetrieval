We  have reviewed the  parties' briefs and\r                            \n\nthe record on appeal.1   Appellant claimed that the defendant\r                                 1\n\nprison officials  were  forbidden by  the Eighth  Amendment's\n\nprohibition  against   cruel  and  unusual   punishment  from\n\nwithdrawing the opportunity  for yard exercise as  a sanction\n\nfor violating a  prison rule.   The district court  dismissed\n\nthe complaint.  We affirm.\n\n     Exercise is \"an identifiable  human need,\" and depriving\n\nan  inmate  of the  ability  to exercise  may,  under certain\n\ncircumstances, such as an excessively long deprivation, raise\n\nEighth Amendment concerns.

However, that is not the case here.\n\nWe  conclude that the  district court correctly  rejected the\n\nclaim that the sanction -- loss  of yard exercise for 45 days\n\n-- imposed after appellant  was found guilty of assisting  in\n\nthe assault of another inmate by  striking that inmate's head\n\nwith  his fists  and with  a  typewriter violated  the Eighth\n\nAmendment.
