Quiles-Espinosa, Senior Litigation\r                                                           \r\nCounsel, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.  Appellant Henry Antonio Santana appeals his\r                           \r\n\nconviction  on the charge of attempting to reenter the United\r\n\nStates, after previously having been deported, without having\r\n\nobtained the  permission of the Attorney  General.  Appellant\r\n\nalleges  that: (1)  the government  and  court constructively\r\n\namended  the indictment against him; and  (2) the court erred\r\n\nin failing to give the proper jury instructions.  We affirm.\r\n\n     Appellant  was charged  in a  one count  indictment with\r\n\nillegally  reentering the  United  States in  violation of  8\r\n\nU.S.C.   1326.   At trial, appellant moved for  a judgment of\r\n\nacquittal   on   the   ground   that   the   government   had\r\n\nconstructively  amended  the  indictment since  the  evidence\r\n\nshowed that appellant was guilty at most of attempted reentry\r\n\nnot the  reentry for which he  had been indicted.   The court\r\n\nagreed  with  appellant that  the  facts  presented at  trial\r\n\nsupported only  a charge  of attempted  reentry.  The  court,\r\n\nhowever, denied the motion for acquittal.  The court reasoned\r\n\nthat the difference between  the indictment and the proof  at\r\n\ntrial   amounted  only   to   a   nonprejudicial   variance.1\r\n\nSubsequently, the court  instructed the jury as if  the crime\r\n\ncharged were attempted reentry.  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  A  deported  alien  can  violate Section  1326  in  three\r\nseparate  ways: if he \"enters,\" \"attempts to enter\" or \"is at\r\nany time found  in\" the United States.  See  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\nRodriguez, 26 F.3d 4, 8 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                     \r\r\n\n     The  determinative issue  in  this case  is whether  the\r\n\ndifference between  the indictment  and the proof  offered at\r\n\ntrial amounted to a constructive  amendment or to a variance.\r\n\nThe former is  grounds for reversal per se.  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nFisher, 3 F.3d 456, 463 (1st Cir. 1993).  The    latter    is\r                  \r\n\ngrounds  for  reversal  only  if  it  affects  a  defendant's\r\n\nsubstantial rights.  Id.  Appellant does not contend that the\r                                   \r\n\ndifferences in proof affected his substantial rights.\r\n\n     No constructive amendment occurred in the instant  case.\r\n\nA  constructive amendment  of an  indictment occurs  when the\r\n\nevidence  at trial  and/or jury  instructions  \"broaden[] the\r                                                                   \r\n\npossible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the\r\n\nindictment.\"   United  States v.  Miller, 471  U.S. 130,  138\r                                                    \r\n\n(1985)  (emphasis in  original);  see also  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nFloresca,  38 F.3d 706, 710 (4th Cir. 1994); United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nRosenthal, 9 F.3d 1016, 1021 (2d Cir. 1993); United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nKramer, 955 F.2d 479, 487 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S.Ct.\r                                                              \r\n\n595  (1992); United States v. Wright, 932 F.2d 868, 864 (10th\r                                                \r\n\nCir.), cert.  denied, 502  U.S. 962 (1991).   A  constructive\r                                \r\n\namendment violates  both a defendant's fifth  amendment right\r\n\nto be tried only on the charge made by the grand jury and his\r\n\nsixth amendment right  to be informed of  the charges against\r\n\nhim.   United  States v. Kelly,  722 F.2d 873,  876 (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1070 (1984).  \r                               \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n     Appellant was indicted for illegal  reentry after having\r\n\nbeen  deported.  He was  convicted of the  attempt to reenter\r\n\nafter  having  been deported.    As  appellant concedes,  the\r\n\nlatter  is  a lesser  included offense  of  the former.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited  States v.  Anderson, 987  F.2d 251,  254 (9th  Cir.),\r                                       \r\n\ncert.  denied, 114 S.Ct. 157 (1993).   By indicting appellant\r                         \r\n\nfor illegal reentry, the  grand jury then necessarily charged\r\n\nall the  elements  of the  offense for  attempted reentry  as\r\n\nwell.  Since the different proof  at trial did not add to the\r\n\nelements of the offense  charged, appellant was not convicted\r\n\nof  a crime  not  charged  in the  indictment.    Nor can  he\r\n\nreasonably have been unaware of  the nature of the accusation\r\n\nagainst him.  See United  States v. Arcadipane, 41 F.3d  1, 6\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st  Cir.  1994)  (no  material prejudice  as  long  as  the\r\n\nindictment gives  defendant notice of the  events charged and\r\n\nthe proof at trial centers on the same events).\r\n\n     Appellant also claims the court erred by not instructing\r\n\nthe jury  to consider  whether he  attempted  to reenter  the\r\n\ncountry  only after the jury had considered whether he had in\r\n\nfact  reentered the  country  as charged  in the  indictment.\r\n\nAppellant did not object to the charge given.  Therefore, our\r\n\nreview  is limited to plain error.  United States v. Andujar,\r                                                                        \r\n\n49 F.3d 16, 22 (1st Cir. 1995).  \r\n\n     Since the evidence presented at trial did not  support a\r\n\nfinding that appellant  reentered the country  illegally, the\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ncourt committed no error,  much less plain error,  in failing\r\n\nto give the requested instruction.\r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                               \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",

A constructive amendment violates both a defendant's fifth amendment right to be tried only on the charge made by the grand jury and his sixth amendment right to be informed of the charges against him.  United States v. Kelly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"428305\"><a href=\"/opinion/428305/united-states-v-james-a-kelly-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">873</span></a></span>, 876 (1st Cir.1983), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1070</span> </span>(1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant was indicted for illegal reentry after having been deported.  He was convicted of the attempt to reenter after having been deported.  As appellant concedes, the latter is a lesser included offense of the former.  See United States v. Anderson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></span>, 254 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span> </span>(1993).  By indicting appellant for illegal reentry, the grand jury then necessarily charged all the elements of the offense for attempted reentry as well.  Since the different proof at trial did not add to the elements of the offense charged, appellant was not convicted of a crime not charged in the indictment.  Nor can he reasonably have been unaware of the nature of the accusation against him.  See United States v. Arcadipane, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195748\"><a href=\"/opinion/195748/united-states-v-arcadipane/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1994) (no material prejudice as long as the indictment gives defendant notice of the events charged and the proof at trial centers on the same events).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also claims the court erred by not instructing the jury to consider whether he attempted to reenter the country only after the jury had considered whether he had in fact reentered the country as charged in the indictment.  Appellant did not object to the charge given.  Therefore, our review is limited to plain error.  United States v. Andujar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195947\"><a href=\"/opinion/195947/united-states-v-andujar/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the evidence presented at trial did not support a finding that appellant reentered the country illegally, the court committed no error, much less plain error, in failing to give the requested instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.
