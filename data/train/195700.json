Appellant Eduarda  C.

Amaral\n\nclaims to have suffered  discrimination in violation of Title\n\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.    2000e.  The\n\ncourt  dismissed the  action  on the  ground that  Amaral had\n\nfailed to file  a timely discrimination charge with the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission  [EEOC].  We have  reviewed\n\nthe record in this case, as well as  the parties' briefs, and\n\nwe affirm essentially  on the  same grounds  as those  relied\n\nupon by the district court.  \n\n     In a  \"deferral state\" like  Rhode Island, see  Paulo v.\n                                                          \n\nCooley,  Inc.,  686  F.

The\n              \n\nevidence in the instant case is uncontested that Amaral filed\n\na  sworn complaint with the EEOC, see 42 U.S.C.   2000e-5(b);\n                                     \n\n29 C.F.R.    1601.9 (charge of discrimination must  be signed\n\nand verified under  oath), only on September  25, 1992, which\n\nwas  291 days  after the  most recent  alleged discriminatory\n\nconduct.  \n\n     Moreover, Amaral  has not presented  sufficient evidence\n\nto  entitle  her  to  equitable tolling  of  the  limitations\n\n                             -2-\n\nperiod.
