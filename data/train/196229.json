Dyonics removed  to\r\n\nfederal court, where Violette  ultimately obtained a jury verdict\r\n\nin the  amount of $250,000.   Dyonics' appeal duly followed.   It\r\n\nmust fail.\r\n\n          The relevant prior proceedings and the facts supporting\r\n\nthe  jury's  verdict, see  Data  General  Corp. v.  Grumman  Sys.\r                                                                           \r\n\nSupport  Corp.,  36  F.3d 1147,  1172  (1st  Cir.  1994), may  be\r                        \r\n\nsketched briefly.   In the summer  of 1991, Violette  experienced\r\n\nnumbness in his hands and consulted Dr. Robert C.G. Hottentot, an\r\n\northopedic surgeon.  Dr.  Hottentot's diagnosis was carpal tunnel\r\n\nsyndrome,  and  Violette  underwent  a  relatively  new  surgical\r\n\n\"endoscopic\" procedure involving the insertion of a slotted metal\r\n\ntube with a camera lens  into the carpal tunnel running  from the\r\n\npatient's  wrist to his palm.  The surgeon employed the technique\r\n\ndeveloped  and equipment  manufactured  by Dyonics  known as  the\r\n\nECTRA System (the \"product\"), which consists of an  endoscope and\r\n\na  set of  related devices  specifically designed  for endoscopic\r\n\ncarpal ligament release.   The outcome of the  surgery was not as\r\n\ndoctor and patient had hoped -- Violette's ulnar nerve and artery\r\n\nwere severed, resulting  in permanent injury  to the nerve  which\r\n\nleft  his small and  ring fingers curled  up into the  shape of a\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nclaw.\r\n\n          Violette's   tort   action   against  Dyonics   alleged\r\n\nnegligence (primarily failure to warn), design defect, and breach\r\n\nof  warranty.  In its  post-removal Answer, Dyonics asserted four\r\n\naffirmative  defenses:     1)   the  product  was   designed  and\r\n\nmanufactured using  techniques representing the state  of the art\r\n\nat the time it was manufactured and sold; 2) any harm to Violette\r\n\nwas  caused  entirely by  the fault  of  third parties  for which\r\n\nDyonics  cannot  be held  liable;  3)  Dyonics provided  adequate\r\n\ninstructions and  warnings regarding  the appropriate use  of the\r\n\nproduct;  and  4)  \"Federal  regulation of  the  subject  product\r\n\npreempts the present action.\"\r\n\n          With the parties' consent,  the case proceeded to trial\r\n\nbefore  a United States Magistrate  Judge on the  failure to warn\r\n\nand design  defect theories, Violette having waived his breach of\r\n\nwarranty claim.   At the  close of  Violette's evidence,  Dyonics\r\n\nmoved for directed verdict,  which was denied.  A  renewed motion\r\n\nfor directed verdict, made at the  end of the defense case, and a\r\n\nmotion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for new trial,\r\n\nmade after the  jury came back  in Violette's favor,  met with  a\r\n\nsimilar fate.   Other than  asserting federal  preemption in  its\r\n\nanswer, Dyonics never  mentioned it again either before or during\r\n\nthe trial.   It surfaced as an allegedly  viable issue only after\r\n\nthe jury returned its verdict.\r\n\n          A.  Preemption\r                    A.  Preemption\r\n\n          The thrust of Dyonics' appeal is that provisions of the\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nFederal Food, Drug  and Cosmetic Act of 1938,  21 U.S.C.A.    301\r\n\net seq.  (West 1972 &amp;  Supp. 1993), preempt  Violette's state-law\r                 \r\n\nproducts liability  claims.  Specifically, Dyonics  points to the\r\n\nMedical Device Amendments  of 1976, 21  U.S.C.A.    351-60  (West\r\n\nSupp.  1993), as  barring the  claims made  in this  case.1   See\r                                                                           \r\n\ngenerally Gail  H. Javitt, I've  Got You Under  My Skin --  And I\r                                                                           \r\n\nCan't  Get  Redress: An  Analysis of  Recent Case  Law Addressing\r                                                                           \r\n\nPreemption  of  Manufacturer  Liability  for  Class  III  Medical\r                                                                           \r\n\nDevices, 49  FOOD AND  DRUG L.J.  553 (1994).   It is  simply too\r                 \r\n\nlate,  however, for Dyonics to make this argument.  Regardless of\r\n\nits potential  applicability, and  we express  no opinion  on the\r\n\nsubject, Dyonics  has waived the  preemption issue by  raising it\r\n\nsubstantively for the first time after trial.  \r\n\n          The  question  of  waiver  is controlled  by  a  recent\r\n\ndecision of this court, Sweeney v. Westvaco Co., 926 F.2d 29, 36-\r                                                         \r\n\n41 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 899 (1991).  In Sweeney, we\r                                                                       \r\n\nheld  that the defendant waived its preemption defense by waiting\r\n\nto raise it until after the jury had returned an adverse verdict.\r\n\nId.  at 37.    Westvaco's  failure to  \"alert  the  court to  the\r             \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  The amendment states in part:  \r\n\n            [N]o  state  .  .  .  may   establish  or\r\n            continue  in effect  with  respect  to  a\r\n            device   intended   for  human   use  any\r\n            requirement  . . .   which  is  different\r\n            from,  or in addition to, any requirement\r\n            applicable  under  this  chapter  to  the\r\n            device,  and . . .  which relates  to the\r\n            safety  or effectiveness of the device. .\r\n            . .\r\n\n21 U.S.C.   360k(a) (West Supp. 1993).\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nproblem\" at any  one of  myriad opportunities prior  to the  jury\r\n\nverdict led us to decline to consider the defense.\r\n\n          So here.  An issue not presented to the trial court may\r\n\nnot be raised for the first time on appeal.  G.D. v.

Although  Dyonics  pleaded preemption  as  an\r\n\naffirmative defense in its answer,  it neither developed a record\r\n\non the issue  nor pressed it in  any fashion before  the district\r\n\ncourt.   Merely mentioning an issue in a pleading is insufficient\r\n\nto carry a party's burden actually to present a claim or  defense\r\n\nto the  district  court  before arguing  the  matter  on  appeal.\r\n\nCookish v.

It chose, however, neither to file a motion to\r\n\ndismiss nor to press for  summary judgment on the issue.   In its\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nPretrial Memorandum, under the  headings \"Facts and Defenses\" and\r\n\n\"Controverted  Points of  Law,\"  Dyonics asserted  only that  the\r\n\nendoscopic  carpal  tunnel surgery  was  an  \"accepted practice\";\r\n\nthat  it  warned  physicians,  including Dr.  Hottentot,  of  the\r\n\npossibility of injury such as that incurred by Violette; and that\r\n\nViolette's   claim  was  barred  by  the  \"learned  intermediary\"\r\n\ndefense.   There  is no mention  of preemption.   Nor did Dyonics\r\n\nassert preemption  in its  trial brief, its  numerous motions  in\r\n\nlimine,  its two motions for directed verdict, and its motion for\r\n\njudgment  n.o.v. or for new trial.   See Sweeney, 926 F.2d at 38.\r                                                          \r\n\nFor whatever  reason, it is  plain that preemption  flickered but\r\n\nonce,  dimly, on  the radar  screen of  this litigation  and then\r\n\ndisappeared   forever,  abandoned   by  Dyonics,   depriving  the\r\n\nmagistrate  judge  of his  rightful  opportunity  to address  the\r\n\nquestion  in the first instance.   To allow  Dyonics to resurrect\r\n\nthe  issue here would undermine  the logic behind  our refusal to\r\n\nconsider issues not  presented below:  Dyonics \"cannot  evade the\r\n\nscrutiny of  the district court . . .  on appeal with a new claim\r\n\nin order to create essentially a new trial.\"  Westmoreland School\r                                                                           \r\n\nDistrict, 930 F.2d at 950.

Where,  however, the question is whether  state tort\r\n\nor   federal   statutory   law   controls,   preemption   is  not\r\n\njurisdictional and is subject to  the ordinary rules of appellate\r\n\nadjudication, including  timely presentment and waiver.

This case  presents a \"choice-of-law\"  question and thus\r\n\nfalls  squarely within the  latter category.

The  language of  the\r                                           \r\nstatute and its application in Mendes leave open  the possibility\r                                               \r\nthat a state may impose, establish, or continue burdens identical\r\nto the  federal standards, leading ineluctably  to the conclusion\r\nthat the statute's preemptive effect  is not jurisdictional.  Had\r\nDyonics brought its preemption argument before the district court\r\nat the proper time,  like the Mendes plaintiff, this  Court could\r                                              \r\nhave reached  the merits.

This   process  involves  an\r\n\nexamination  of  utility,  risk,  and the  feasibility  of  safer\r\n\nalternatives.  St.  Germain, 544 A.2d  at 1285 (quoting  Stanley,\r                                                                          \r\n\n462 A.2d at 1148).  The jury's determination that the product was\r\n\nnot safely designed to  carry out its intended use  was supported\r\n\nby the evidence, and therefore must stand.  \r\n\n          Dr. Morton  Kasdan testified that the  product here was\r\n\ndefectively designed  because it required  only approximations in\r\n\nthe initial  placement of  the tube  on the  outside of the  skin\r\n\nwithout  being able to  see the ulnar nerve  and artery, and that\r\n\nwhen inserted below the  carpal ligament, the knife cuts  through\r\n\nthe  ligament  before  the surgeon  can  see  what  is above  the\r\n\nligament.  Dr. Kasdan  also testified that the risk  involved was\r\n\nenormous and  that the product's  use provided no  benefit beyond\r\n\nthose available with the  safer, proven, alternative technique of\r\n\nopen carpal tunnel surgery.  Dyonics' own expert admitted that he\r\n\nhad   participated   in   the  development   of   an  alternative\r\n\n\"extrabursal\"  technique which  sought to  minimize the  risks by\r\n\nmoving the initial placement point  and the cutting line  further\r\n\nfrom the ulnar nerve.  Given such testimony, there was sufficient\r\n\ncompetent  evidence for the jury to believe and conclude that the\r\n\nECTRA  System  was unreasonably  dangerous  and  of little  added\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nutility  compared   to  available   alternatives  --   in  short,\r\n\ndefectively designed.3\r\n\n          The jury's determination that Dyonics failed to provide\r\n\nadequate  warnings and  directions is  likewise supported  by the\r\n\nevidence.   A  manufacturer must  provide expected  users of  its\r\n\nproduct with warnings of  the risks and \"specific directions  for\r\n\nthe product's safe use.\"  Pottle v.

While the  Supreme Judicial Court of  Maine has\r\n\nnot  decided  the  matter,  the general  rule  regarding  medical\r\n\ndevices (and, more frequently and by analogy, prescription drugs)\r\n\nis that the manufacturer must warn the physician -- the so-called\r\n\n\"learned  intermediary\" --  and  not the  patient directly.

Dr.  Hottentot was not\r\n\nprovided with any materials referring to this safer  technique or\r\n\ngiven adequate warnings of  the real potential for complications.\r\n\nOn this record, we conclude that the jury had sufficient basis to\r\n\nfind Dyonics in breach of its duty to warn.\r\n\n          Dyonics argues that  a failure to  warn claim will  not\r\n\nlie  under Maine law where the risk of danger associated with the\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nuse  of the product  was obvious to  the user, citing  Lorfano v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nDura  Stone Steps, Inc., 569  A.2d 195, 197  (Me. 1990) (\"dangers\r                                 \r\n\nposed by the use of steps without a handrail are patently obvious\r\n\nand  equally apparent  to  all\").   A high-technology,  precision\r\n\nmedical device  is, needless to say,  a far cry from  a handrail.\r\n\nMoreover,  while a physician cannot be held liable for an adverse\r\n\noutcome  simply because the result  could have been  avoided by a\r\n\ndifferent selection as between two reasonable procedures, Roberts\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  Tardif,  417  A.2d  444,  448  (Me.  1980),  here  there  was\r                    \r\n\nsufficient  evidence  that   use    of   the  ECTRA  System   was\r\n\nunreasonably   dangerous  without  further   warnings  or  proper\r\n\ninstructional  materials.    A   jury  could  conclude  that  Dr.\r\n\nHottentot's uninformed choice of the product was not a reasonable\r\n\nselection of an alternative  surgical procedure, thus  insulating\r\n\nDyonics  from liability.  Any  extension of Roberts  to protect a\r                                                             \r\n\nmanufacturer in Dyonics' position is unwarranted.\r\n\n            A  jury verdict may be set  aside \"only if [it] is so\r\n\nseriously mistaken, so  clearly against the law  or the evidence,\r\n\nas to constitute a  miscarriage of justice.\"  Levesque  v. Anchor\r                                                                           \r\n\nMotor Freight,Inc.,  832 F.2d 702, 703 (1st  Cir. 1987).  Such is\r                            \r\n\nnot the case here.\r\n\n          Finally,  the magistrate  judge committed  no error  by\r\n\nrefusing to give two proposed jury instructions.   Dyonics sought\r\n\nan instruction, based on Roberts, supra, that a manufacturer of a\r                                                 \r\n\nmedical device cannot be  held liable merely because  the surgeon\r\n\ncould have pursued  an alternate course of treatment  and thereby\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\navoided the injury.  As noted above, such an extension of Roberts\r                                                                           \r\n\nis unwarranted in this  case.  Dyonics also sought  the following\r\n\ninstruction, citing May v. Dafoe, 611 P.2d 1275, 1278 (Wash. App.\r                                          \r\n\n1980):\r\n\n            A manufacturer of medical products is not\r\n            responsible   for   the   education   and\r\n            training  of  doctors  who  may  use  its\r\n            product.       The   responsibility   for\r\n            determining whether  an individual doctor\r\n            is  sufficiently  skilled and  trained to\r\n            use  a particular  product lies  with the\r\n            doctor   himself   or  herself   and  the\r\n            facilities where they practice.\r\n\nSuch instruction  was unnecessary in this  failure to warn-design\r\n\ndefect  case  and,  in  any  event,  the  refusal  to  give  this\r\n\ninstruction caused  no prejudice  to Dyonics since  Dr. Hottentot\r\n\nfollowed the product instructions  he had been given.   See Davet\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Maccarone,  973 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"An error in jury\r                      \r\n\ninstructions will  warrant reversal  of a  judgment  only if  the\r\n\nerror is determined to  have been prejudicial, based on  a review\r\n\nof the record as a whole\").\r\n\n          For these reasons, the Amended Judgment entered in this\r\n\naction  on March  17, 1994,  pursuant to  the jury's  verdict, is\r\n\naffirmed.4\r                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  Violette also  cross-appealed, requesting reversal of numerous\r\nrulings  of the magistrate judge  in the event  we had determined\r\nthat Dyonics was entitled to  a new trial.

In the summer  of 1991, Violette  experienced\r\n\nnumbness in his hands and consulted Dr. Robert C.G. Hottentot, an\r\n\northopedic surgeon.  Dr.  Hottentot's diagnosis was carpal tunnel\r\n\nsyndrome,  and  Violette  underwent  a  relatively  new  surgical\r\n\n\"endoscopic\" procedure involving the insertion of a slotted metal\r\n\ntube with a camera lens  into the carpal tunnel running  from the\r\n\npatient's  wrist to his palm.  The surgeon employed the technique\r\n\ndeveloped  and equipment  manufactured  by Dyonics  known as  the\r\n\nECTRA System (the \"product\"), which consists of an  endoscope and\r\n\na  set of  related devices  specifically designed  for endoscopic\r\n\ncarpal ligament release.   The outcome of the  surgery was not as\r\n\ndoctor and patient had hoped -- Violette's ulnar nerve and artery\r\n\nwere severed, resulting  in permanent injury  to the nerve  which\r\n\nleft  his small and  ring fingers curled  up into the  shape of a\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nclaw.\r\n\n          Violette's   tort   action   against  Dyonics   alleged\r\n\nnegligence (primarily failure to warn), design defect, and breach\r\n\nof  warranty.  In its  post-removal Answer, Dyonics asserted four\r\n\naffirmative  defenses:     1)   the  product  was   designed  and\r\n\nmanufactured using  techniques representing the state  of the art\r\n\nat the time it was manufactured and sold; 2) any harm to Violette\r\n\nwas  caused  entirely by  the fault  of  third parties  for which\r\n\nDyonics  cannot  be held  liable;  3)  Dyonics provided  adequate\r\n\ninstructions and  warnings regarding  the appropriate use  of the\r\n\nproduct;  and  4)  \"Federal  regulation of  the  subject  product\r\n\npreempts the present action.\"\r\n\n          With the parties' consent,  the case proceeded to trial\r\n\nbefore  a United States Magistrate  Judge on the  failure to warn\r\n\nand design  defect theories, Violette having waived his breach of\r\n\nwarranty claim.   At the  close of  Violette's evidence,  Dyonics\r\n\nmoved for directed verdict,  which was denied.  A  renewed motion\r\n\nfor directed verdict, made at the  end of the defense case, and a\r\n\nmotion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for new trial,\r\n\nmade after the  jury came back  in Violette's favor,  met with  a\r\n\nsimilar fate.   Other than  asserting federal  preemption in  its\r\n\nanswer, Dyonics never  mentioned it again either before or during\r\n\nthe trial.   It surfaced as an allegedly  viable issue only after\r\n\nthe jury returned its verdict.\r\n\n          A.  Preemption\r                    A.  Preemption\r\n\n          The thrust of Dyonics' appeal is that provisions of the\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nFederal Food, Drug  and Cosmetic Act of 1938,  21 U.S.C.A.    301\r\n\net seq.  (West 1972 &amp;  Supp. 1993), preempt  Violette's state-law\r                 \r\n\nproducts liability  claims.  Specifically, Dyonics  points to the\r\n\nMedical Device Amendments  of 1976, 21  U.S.C.A.    351-60  (West\r\n\nSupp.  1993), as  barring the  claims made  in this  case.1   See\r                                                                           \r\n\ngenerally Gail  H.

It is  simply too\r                 \r\n\nlate,  however, for Dyonics to make this argument.

The jury's determination that the product was\r\n\nnot safely designed to  carry out its intended use  was supported\r\n\nby the evidence, and therefore must stand.  \r\n\n          Dr. Morton  Kasdan testified that the  product here was\r\n\ndefectively designed  because it required  only approximations in\r\n\nthe initial  placement of  the tube  on the  outside of the  skin\r\n\nwithout  being able to  see the ulnar nerve  and artery, and that\r\n\nwhen inserted below the  carpal ligament, the knife cuts  through\r\n\nthe  ligament  before  the surgeon  can  see  what  is above  the\r\n\nligament.  Dr. Kasdan  also testified that the risk  involved was\r\n\nenormous and  that the product's  use provided no  benefit beyond\r\n\nthose available with the  safer, proven, alternative technique of\r\n\nopen carpal tunnel surgery.  Dyonics' own expert admitted that he\r\n\nhad   participated   in   the  development   of   an  alternative\r\n\n\"extrabursal\"  technique which  sought to  minimize the  risks by\r\n\nmoving the initial placement point  and the cutting line  further\r\n\nfrom the ulnar nerve.  Given such testimony, there was sufficient\r\n\ncompetent  evidence for the jury to believe and conclude that the\r\n\nECTRA  System  was unreasonably  dangerous  and  of little  added\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nutility  compared   to  available   alternatives  --   in  short,\r\n\ndefectively designed.3\r\n\n          The jury's determination that Dyonics failed to provide\r\n\nadequate  warnings and  directions is  likewise supported  by the\r\n\nevidence.   A  manufacturer must  provide expected  users of  its\r\n\nproduct with warnings of  the risks and \"specific directions  for\r\n\nthe product's safe use.\"  Pottle v.

See Davet\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

As Dyonics is  not so\r\nentitled,  there is no need  to address the  issues raised by the\r\ncross-appeal, and it is dismissed as moot.\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n</pre>",
