Cotnoir then filed suit against the\n\nUMA and  three university employees,  Chancellor Robert Woodbury,\n\nPresident George  Connick,  and  Provost  Richard  Randall  (\"the\n\nindividual defendants\"), pursuant to  42 U.S.C.   1983, alleging,\n\namong other things, that the individual defendants denied Cotnoir\n\nprocedural  due  process in  connection  with  their decision  to\n\nterminate his  employment.   The individual defendants  moved for\n\nsummary  judgment,  requesting  that  they  be granted  qualified\n\nimmunity.   The  district  court  denied their  motion  and  this\n\ninterlocutory appeal followed.   We find  that at this  juncture,\n\nthe individual defendants are  not entitled to qualified immunity\n\nwith  respect  to Cotnoir's  procedural  due  process claim,  and\n\ntherefore, we affirm.\n\n                    I.  STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n                                             \n\n          A.  Facts\n\n          When a  defendant moves  for summary judgment  based on\n\nthe doctrine  of qualified  immunity, the  court must  review the\n\nfacts  in  the light  most favorable  to  the plaintiff.   Febus-\n                                                                 \n\nRodr guez  v. Betancourt-Lebr n, 14 F.3d  87, 89 (1st Cir. 1994).\n                               \n\nThe  facts appearing from  the summary judgment  materials are as\n\nfollows.\n\n          Cotnoir was a  tenured professor  at the  UMA, and  was\n\nalso  the Chairperson  of the  Business and  Governmental Science\n\n                              - 2 -\n\nDivision (\"BAGS\").  On October 29, 1991, another professor at the\n\nUMA,  Ronald  Norton,  sent a  letter  to  the  dean of  students\n\nindicating that  a BAGS student  had received 56  credits without\n\nhaving attended classes.   Norton's letter further indicated that\n\nthis  particular  student was  registered  as  a Maine  resident,\n\nalthough he was living in Louisiana.\n\n          In response to the letter, Richard Randall, the Provost\n\nat  the UMA,  conducted  an  investigation.    As  part  of  this\n\ninvestigation,  Randall  interviewed   Cotnoir,  several  of  his\n\ncolleagues, and other  individuals with  knowledge regarding  the\n\nincident.   On December 13,  1991, Randall completed  his report,\n\nand gave  it to George Connick,  the President of the  UMA.  This\n\nreport contained  a summary of Randall's  findings regarding this\n\nacademic  matter  and  included an  explicit  recommendation that\n\nCotnoir be dismissed.\n\n          On December 16, 1991, Connick sent a letter to Cotnoir,\n\nwhich stated:\n\n            Provost Richard Randall has completed his\n            report to me on  the investigation of the\n            academic   issues  raised   by  Professor\n            Ronald  Norton in  his letter  of October\n            29, 1991.\n\n            I wish  to offer  you the opportunity  to\n            meet  with me so  that you  might further\n            clarify  your  role  in  this  series  of\n            events,  prior  to  my  determining  what\n            action to take.  It is important that you\n            understand  that disciplinary  action may\n            result  from  my  investigation  of  your\n            participation  in  this serious  academic\n            matter.\n\n            If you would like to meet with me, please\n            call  Lisa  Grundstrom-Whitney, Assistant\n\n                              - 3 -\n\n            to the President, immediately, so that an\n            appointment  can  be arranged  before the\n            endof theday, Wednesday,December 18,1991.\n\n          On December 17, 1991, Connick met with Cotnoir.  During\n\nthis  meeting,  Connick explained  to  Cotnoir  that Randall  had\n\nprepared a report  of the  investigation.  Connick  did not  show\n\nCotnoir the report, and Cotnoir apparently did not ask to see the\n\nreport.    Cotnoir did  not make  a  statement, and  Connick then\n\nproceeded to ask Cotnoir twelve questions about the BAGS student,\n\nwhich Cotnoir answered.  \n\n          On  December 27,  1991, Connick  sent Cotnoir  a letter\n\ninforming  him  that  his  employment  was  terminated  effective\n\nDecember 31, 1991.  Cotnoir then filed a grievance  regarding the\n\ntermination.    Connick   appointed  Sherri  Stevens,   Executive\n\nDirector  of Administrative  Services,  to be  his designee,  and\n\nimpartially  review the  matter.   Although Stevens never  held a\n\nhearing,  she met  with  Cotnoir and  his faculty  representative\n\nthree  times.   On June 5,  1992, Stevens  submitted a  report to\n\nConnick concluding  that the UMA had met its burden of proof that\n\nthere  was sufficient  cause to terminate  Cotnoir, and  that the\n\ntermination decision  should not  be reversed.   Connick accepted\n\nher report.   At this time, Stevens was also representing the UMA\n\nin opposing  Cotnoir's request  for unemployment  benefits before\n\nMaine's  Department of Labor,  on the basis  of Cotnoir's alleged\n\nmisconduct.\n\n          On  June  17,  1992,  Cotnoir filed  a  grievance  with\n\nChancellor  Woodbury.   Woodbury  appointed Samuel  D'Amico,  the\n\n                              - 4 -\n\nAssociate  Vice Chancellor,  to review  Cotnoir's grievance.   On\n\nJuly 13,  1992,  D'Amico notified  Cotnoir  that  his review  was\n\nlimited to a determination of whether proper procedures  had been\n\nfollowed.     D'Amico   ultimately   concluded   that   Cotnoir's\n\ntermination  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  grievance\n\nprocedures set  forth in  the UMA's handbook  for non-represented\n\nemployees.    D'Amico notified  Cotnoir that  he  had a  right to\n\nappeal to the University of Maine System Board of Trustees.\n\n          Cotnoir then waived his right to appeal to the Board of\n\nTrustees, and the UMA agreed to this waiver.    \n\n          B.  Proceedings Below\n\n          Following his  termination, Cotnoir filed  this action,\n\nalleging claims under 42  U.S.C.   1983, as well as pendent state\n\nclaims.   The claim which underlies this appeal is that Woodbury,\n\nConnick, and Randall, violated  Cotnoir's right to procedural due\n\nprocess  in  conjunction with  their  decision  to terminate  his\n\nemployment.    The   individual  defendants  moved  for   summary\n\njudgment.   In this motion, they claimed, in part, that they were\n\nentitled  to   qualified  immunity  with   respect  to  Cotnoir's\n\nprocedural due process claim.  Magistrate Judge Beaulieu issued a\n\nrecommended decision  denying the individual  defendants' summary\n\njudgment motion on the issue of qualified immunity.  The district\n\ncourt   (Brody,  J.),   then  adopted   the  Magistrate   Judge's\n\nrecommended decision.  This interlocutory appeal followed.\n\n                          II.  ANALYSIS\n                                       \n\n          A.  Jurisdiction\n\n                              - 5 -\n\n          At  the outset,  we  will  discuss  the scope  of  this\n\nappeal.  \"[A]  district court's  denial of a  claim of  qualified\n\nimmunity,  to the extent that it turns on  an issue of law, is an\n\nappealable 'final  decision' within  the meaning  of 28 U.S.C.   \n\n1291. .  . .\"  Febus-Rodr guez,  14 F.3d at 90  (quoting Fonte v.\n                                                              \n\nCollins, 898  F.2d 284,  285 (1st  Cir.  1990)) (other  citations\n       \n\nomitted).    On  appeal, Cotnoir  suggests  that  in addition  to\n\naffirming  the  district  court's denial  of  qualified  immunity\n\nbelow, we should also decree that he is entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter  of  law  on his     1983  procedural  due process  claim.\n\nCotnoir contends that he  is entitled to such a  judgment because\n\nthe  record is  clear  regarding the  events which  occurred with\n\nrespect to his termination.  We decline Cotnoir's invitation, and\n\nadhere  to  our  \"well-established   practice  of  limiting   our\n\ninterlocutory review  to the  issue of qualified  immunity,\" even\n\nwhen the merits of the case are \"inexorably intertwined\" with the\n\nqualified  immunity issue.  Newman v. Massachusetts, 884 F.2d 19,\n                                                   \n\n22 (1st Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1078 (1990) (citations\n                                \n\nomitted). \n\n          B.  The Summary Judgment Standard\n\n          \"Where  a  qualified  immunity defense  is  advanced by\n\npretrial  motion, 'normal  summary judgment  standards' control.\"\n\nAmsden v. Moran, 904 F.2d 748, 752 (1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied,\n                                                                \n\n498 U.S. 1041 (1991)  (citations omitted).  A motion  for summary\n\njudgment must be granted if:\n\n            [T]he pleadings,  depositions, answers to\n            interrogatories, and  admissions on file,\n\n                              - 6 -\n\n            together  with  the  affidavits, if  any,\n            show that there is no genuine issue as to\n            any material  fact  and that  the  moving\n            party  is  entitled to  a  judgment as  a\n            matter of law.\n\nFed.  R. Civ.  P. 56(c).   In this  context, we  will examine the\n\nrecord and \"draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light\n\nmost hospitable to the  party opposing the motion.\"   Amsden, 904\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at  752 (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 255\n                                              \n\n(1986))  (other  citation  omitted).     Because  the  individual\n\ndefendants' summary judgment motion  rested on the legal question\n\nof whether they are  entitled to qualified immunity on  the basis\n\nof  facts which  must,  by definition,  be undisputed,  appellate\n\nreview of the district court's order is plenary.  See Amsden, 904\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at  752.    We  will  therefore delve  into  the  record  to\n\ndetermine  whether a genuine  issue of material  fact exists with\n\nrespect  to  the  individual  defendants'  claim  that  they  are\n\nentitled to qualified immunity.  Unwin v. Campbell, 863 F.2d 124,\n                                                  \n\n132 (1st Cir. 1988).1 \n\n          C.  Qualified Immunity\n\n          Qualified   immunity   shields   government   officials\n\nperforming discretionary functions from civil damages \"insofar as\n\ntheir conduct  does not violate clearly  established statutory or\n\nconstitutional  rights of  which a  reasonable person  would have\n\n                    \n\n1   The three individual  defendants did not  attempt to identify\nwho was  responsible for  each action;  rather,  they focused  on\ntheir  collective  liability.   At  this  juncture, we  will  not\nattempt to  distinguish among the individual  defendants in order\nto determine to what extent each may or may not  have contributed\nto the  alleged harm.  See  Domegan v. Fair, 859  F.2d 1059, 1065\n                                           \n(1st Cir. 1988).\n\n                              - 7 -\n\nknown.\"   Harlow v.

On  a motion  for summary  judgment, \"the\n            relevant question is whether a reasonable\n            official could have believed  his actions\n            were   lawful   in   light   of   clearly\n            established law and  the information  the\n            official  possessed  at the  time  of his\n            allegedly unlawful conduct.\"\n\nFebus-Rodr guez, 14 F.3d  at 91 (quoting  McBride v.

Thus,\n\nthe  central issue  with  respect to  qualified  immunity is  not\n\nwhether  a  defendant  actually  violated a  plaintiff's  rights.\n\nRather, the inquiry focuses on  the objective reasonableness of a\n\ndefendant's actions,  in light of whether  the plaintiff's rights\n\nwere clearly established,  and whether the contours of that right\n\nwere  sufficiently clear  such that  a reasonable  official would\n\nhave  understood that  the actions  he took violated  that right.\n\nSee Amsden, 904 F.2d  at 752-53; Collins v.

It has  long been  \"clearly  established\" that  a tenured\n\nprofessor enjoys a property right sufficient to invoke procedural\n\ndue  process protections.  See Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593,\n                                                  \n\n                              - 8 -\n\n601 (1972);  Collins, 894  F.2d at 478;  Newman, 884  F.2d at  19\n                                               \n\n(citations omitted).     \n\n          We  must  therefore  determine  what  process  was  due\n\nCotnoir, and whether the individual defendants  reasonably should\n\nhave understood that their actions violated Cotnoir's  procedural\n\ndue process  rights.  See  Amsden, 904 F.2d  at 752;  Newman, 884\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  at 23.

The Process Afforded Cotnoir\n\n                              - 9 -\n\n          The dictates of Loudermill squarely control the present\n                                    \n\ncase, and  compel us to find that based on the facts appearing in\n\nthe record,  the individual defendants reasonably  could not have\n\nbelieved that their actions  satisfied the minimum procedural due\n\nprocess  requirements.2    Cotnoir  argues  that  the  individual\n\ndefendants are  attempting to  recast their investigation  of the\n\ncharges  of academic  and administrative  impropriety  which were\n\nalleged against  him,  into  a  hearing  with  respect  to  these\n\ncharges, and their decision to fire him.  Cotnoir argues that, in\n\nfact,  he  was never  afforded  a  hearing where  he  had a  fair\n\nopportunity to present his side of the story.  Based on the facts\n\nnow  appearing  in  the  record,  we  agree  and  find  that  the\n\nindividual defendants' after-the-fact recharacterization of their\n\nactions fails.  At this  juncture, the individual defendants  are\n\nnot entitled to judgment, because it appears from the record that\n\nthey  denied Cotnoir:  1)  adequate notice of  the UMA's proposed\n\ndecision to  terminate his  employment based on  alleged academic\n\nand administrative  improprieties, and  2) an explanation  of the\n\nUMA's evidence against him.    \n\n            1.  Failure to Provide Notice of Proposed Action\n\n          The individual defendants contend  that they were  only\n\nobligated to provide Cotnoir with notice regarding the charges of\n\nacademic  and administrative  improprieties alleged  against him,\n\n                    \n\n2   Our  references to  the  record  facts are  not  intended  to\ndetermine any  factual issue, but  merely reflect the  facts that\nare  either  undisputed or  cannot  be  resolved against  Cotnoir\n                          \nexcept by the fact finder in the trial court.\n\n                              - 10 -\n\nand  that they had no  further obligation to  notify Cotnoir that\n\nthey  were considering  terminating his  employment.   They claim\n\nthat because the record  shows that they notified Cotnoir  of the\n\ncharges against  him, they  did not violate  Cotnoir's procedural\n\ndue process rights, and they are entitled  to qualified immunity.\n\nWe disagree.  When  the  Supreme  Court  decided  Loudermill,  it\n                                                            \n\nclearly contemplated that  when an individual  is faced with  the\n\npotential loss  of a  protected interest, officials  must provide\n\nthe individual with notice of the charges alleged against him and\n                                                                 \n\nany  proposed action the officials intend to take, based on those\n\ncharges.

The record\n\nindicates that Cotnoir initially met with Randall with respect to\n\nRandall's investigation into  the academic incident,  and Cotnoir\n\ngenerally explained what  actions he had  taken relative to  this\n\nincident, and why he  had taken those actions.   After completing\n\nhis investigation, Randall prepared a report, and submitted it to\n\nConnick.  In that report, Randall set forth his findings based on\n\nhis  investigation,  and  recommended  that  Cotnoir   be  fired.\n\nConnick then invited  Cotnoir to  meet with him  so that  Cotnoir\n\ncould  \"clarify [his] role in this series of events,\" and Connick\n\nalerted  Cotnoir  that  unspecified  \"disciplinary  action\" could\n                                                                 \n\nresult.   Cotnoir met with  Connick, at which  time Connick asked\n\nCotnoir to  explain his role, and  Connick asked him a  series of\n\nquestions.  Connick did not show Cotnoir the report, or otherwise\n\nalert Cotnoir to the fact that he was considering terminating his\n\nemployment.   Thus,  despite  the  fact  that Connick  knew  that\n\nRandall  had recommended  termination, and  that this  action was\n\nclearly  being  contemplated,  the  individual  defendants  never\n\nprovided  Cotnoir with any notice  of this proposed  action.  The\n\ndecision of whether or not to terminate  Cotnoir's employment was\n\nthe  very decision  which would  deprive Cotnoir of  his property\n\ninterest,  and the individual  defendants reasonably  should have\n\nknown that they were  required to provide Cotnoir with  notice of\n\n                              - 12 -\n\ntheir  proposed  action  and  an  opportunity  to  contest  their\n\ncontemplated  action,  so  that Cotnoir's  participation  in  the\n\nprocess  could be meaningful.

Failure to  Provide an Explanation  of Employer's\n                Evidence\n\n          When a public employee's  tenured status is threatened,\n\nhe  is entitled  to  an  explanation  of  the  substance  of  the\n\nemployer's evidence against him  so that he can present  his side\n\nof the story.  Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 546.  Based on the present\n                         \n\nrecord,  it  appears that  the  individual  defendants failed  to\n\nprovide Cotnoir with an explanation of their evidence against him\n\nregarding  the academic incident in question.   During the course\n\nof  his investigation,  Randall met  with Cotnoir,  as well  as a\n\n                              - 13 -\n\nnumber  of Cotnoir's  colleagues  and people  who were  otherwise\n\ninvolved,  to determine  precisely  what had  occurred.   Randall\n\nsummarized his investigation in the report which he  submitted to\n\nConnick.   Connick, however, never  showed the report to Cotnoir;\n\nnor  did anyone  else.    No one  ever  informed  Cotnoir of  the\n\nsubstance of Randall's interviews  with his colleagues.  Nor  did\n\nanyone  otherwise  tell  Cotnoir  what in  essence  the  evidence\n\nagainst him  was.  Therefore, Cotnoir had no way to know what the\n\nextent of the  evidence was, what  his alleged role in  the whole\n\nscheme was, and  the seriousness  with which the  UMA viewed  the\n\nincident.   Cotnoir  therefore  did not  have  an opportunity  to\n\nrespond  to, or defend himself against the evidence presented.  A\n\nreasonable  official  should  have  known that  this  failure  to\n\nexplain  the evidence against  an individual violated  one of the\n\nbasic procedural due process requirements.\n\n          F.  The Post-Termination Proceedings\n\n          The   individual   defendants   argue  that   Cotnoir's\n\nprocedural  due process  rights were  not violated  because post-\n\ndeprivation procedures  were available to  ensure that  Cotnoir's\n\ntermination was appropriate,  and that he, in  fact, received the\n\nbenefit of these procedural protections.  We disagree.  \n\n          Where  an employee  is fired  in violation  of  his due\n\nprocess  rights, the  availability of  post-termination grievance\n\nprocedures  will  not  ordinarily  cure the  violation.  Kercad -\n                                                                 \n\nMel ndez  v.  Aponte-Roque, 829  F.2d  255, 263  (1st  Cir. 1987)\n                          \n\n(citing  Schultz v.

Thus,  even  where  a\n             \n\ndischarged employee receives a post-termination hearing to review\n\nadverse personnel action, the pretermination  hearing still needs\n\nto  be extensive enough to  guard against mistaken decisions, and\n\naccordingly, the  employee is entitled to  notice, an explanation\n\nof  the employer's  evidence, and  an opportunity to  present his\n\nside of the story.   See Loudermill, 470 U.S. at  546; Brasslett,\n                                                                \n\n761 F.2d  at 836.

The facts appearing from the summary judgment materials are as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cotnoir was a tenured professor at the UMA, and was also the Chairperson of the Business and Governmental Science Division (\"BAGS\").  On October 29, 1991, another professor at the UMA, Ronald Norton, sent a letter to the dean of students indicating that a BAGS student had received 56 credits without having attended classes.  Norton's letter further indicated that this particular student was registered as a Maine resident, although he was living in Louisiana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the letter, Richard Randall, the Provost at the UMA, conducted an investigation.  As part of this investigation, Randall interviewed Cotnoir, several of his colleagues, and other individuals with knowledge regarding the incident.  On December 13, 1991, Randall completed his report, and gave it to George Connick, the President of the UMA.  This report contained a summary of Randall's findings regarding this academic matter and included an explicit recommendation that Cotnoir be dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 16, 1991, Connick sent a letter to Cotnoir, which stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Provost Richard Randall has completed his report to me on the investigation of the academic issues raised by Professor Ronald Norton in his letter of October 29, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>I wish to offer you the opportunity to meet with me so that you might further clarify your role in this series of events, prior to my determining what action to take.

During this meeting, Connick explained to Cotnoir that Randall had prepared a report of the investigation.  Connick did not show Cotnoir the report, and Cotnoir apparently did not ask to see the report.  Cotnoir did not make a statement, and Connick then proceeded to ask Cotnoir twelve questions about the BAGS student, which Cotnoir answered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 27, 1991, Connick sent Cotnoir a letter informing him that his employment was terminated effective December 31, 1991.  Cotnoir then filed a grievance regarding the termination.  Connick appointed Sherri Stevens, Executive Director of Administrative Services, to be his designee, and impartially review the matter.  Although Stevens never held a hearing, she met with Cotnoir and his faculty representative three times.  On June 5, 1992, Stevens submitted a report to Connick concluding that the UMA had met its burden of proof that there was sufficient cause to terminate Cotnoir, and that the termination decision should not be reversed.  Connick accepted her report.  At this time, Stevens was also representing the UMA in opposing Cotnoir's request for unemployment benefits before Maine's Department of Labor, on the basis of Cotnoir's alleged misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 17, 1992, Cotnoir filed a grievance with Chancellor Woodbury.  Woodbury appointed Samuel D'Amico, the Associate Vice Chancellor, to review Cotnoir's grievance.  On July 13, 1992, D'Amico notified Cotnoir that his review was limited to a determination of whether proper procedures had been followed.  D'Amico ultimately concluded that Cotnoir's termination was conducted in accordance with the grievance procedures set forth in the UMA's handbook for non-represented employees.  D'Amico notified Cotnoir that he had a right to appeal to the University of Maine System Board of Trustees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cotnoir then waived his right to appeal to the Board of Trustees, and the UMA agreed to this waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Proceedings Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following his termination, Cotnoir filed this action, alleging claims under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, as well as pendent state claims.  The claim which underlies this appeal is that Woodbury, Connick, and Randall, violated Cotnoir's right to procedural due process in conjunction with their decision to terminate his employment.  The individual defendants moved for summary judgment.  In this motion, they claimed, in part, that they were entitled to qualified immunity with respect to Cotnoir's procedural due process claim.  Magistrate Judge Beaulieu issued a recommended decision denying the individual defendants' summary judgment motion on the issue of qualified immunity.  The district court (Brody, J.), then adopted the Magistrate Judge's recommended decision.  This interlocutory appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, we will discuss the scope of this appeal.  \"[A] district court's denial of a claim of qualified immunity, to the extent that it turns on an issue of law, is an appealable 'final decision' within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291....\"  Febus-Rodriguez, 14 F.3d at 90 (quoting Fonte v. Collins, 898 F.2d 284, 285 (1st Cir.1990)) (other citations omitted).  On appeal, Cotnoir suggests that in addition to affirming the district court's denial of qualified immunity below, we should also decree that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on his Sec. 1983 procedural due process claim.  Cotnoir contends that he is entitled to such a judgment because the record is clear regarding the events which occurred with respect to his termination.

Rather, the inquiry focuses on the objective reasonableness of a defendant's actions, in light of whether the plaintiff's rights were clearly established, and whether the contours of that right were sufficiently clear such that a reasonable official would have understood that the actions he took violated that right.

Cotnoir argues that, in fact, he was never afforded a hearing where he had a fair opportunity to present his side of the story.  Based on the facts now appearing in the record, we agree and find that the individual defendants' after-the-fact recharacterization of their actions fails.  At this juncture, the individual defendants are not entitled to judgment, because it appears from the record that they denied Cotnoir:  1) adequate notice of the UMA's proposed decision to terminate his employment based on alleged academic and administrative improprieties, and 2) an explanation of the UMA's evidence against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

They claim that because the record shows that they notified Cotnoir of the charges against him, they did not violate Cotnoir's procedural due process rights, and they are entitled to qualified immunity.

The record indicates that Cotnoir initially met with Randall with respect to Randall's investigation into the academic incident, and Cotnoir generally explained what actions he had taken relative to this incident, and why he had taken those actions.  After completing his investigation, Randall prepared a report, and submitted it to Connick.  In that report, Randall set forth his findings based on his investigation, and recommended that Cotnoir be fired.  Connick then invited Cotnoir to meet with him so that Cotnoir could \"clarify [his] role in this series of events,\" and Connick alerted Cotnoir that unspecified \"disciplinary action\" could result.  Cotnoir met with Connick, at which time Connick asked Cotnoir to explain his role, and Connick asked him a series of questions.  Connick did not show Cotnoir the report, or otherwise alert Cotnoir to the fact that he was considering terminating his employment.  Thus, despite the fact that Connick knew that Randall had recommended termination, and that this action was clearly being contemplated, the individual defendants never provided Cotnoir with any notice of this proposed action.  The decision of whether or not to terminate Cotnoir's employment was the very decision which would deprive Cotnoir of his property interest, and the individual defendants reasonably should have known that they were required to provide Cotnoir with notice of their proposed action and an opportunity to contest their contemplated action, so that Cotnoir's participation in the process could be meaningful.  See generally Collins, 894 F.2d at 481 (finding that where professor had no reason to believe his tenure was being questioned, and notice of hearing was abrupt and uninformative, officials did not afford professor a real chance to present his side of the story and this violated his procedural due process rights);  cf. Newman v. Burgin, 930 F.2d 955, 960 (1st Cir.1991) (finding that tenured professor was not deprived of procedural due process when school officials provided professor with notice of proposed action, and a trial-type hearing before a neutral decisionmaker);  Brasslett, 761 F.2d at 836 (finding that former town fire chief was not deprived of procedural due process when he was notified of the possibility of discharge because of alleged improprieties committed while fire chief, and was afforded ample opportunity to defend his actions and rebut any erroneous allegations).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 546, 105 S.Ct. at 1495.   Based on the present record, it appears that the individual defendants failed to provide Cotnoir with an explanation of their evidence against him regarding the academic incident in question.  During the course of his investigation, Randall met with Cotnoir, as well as a number of Cotnoir's colleagues and people who were otherwise involved, to determine precisely what had occurred.  Randall summarized his investigation in the report which he submitted to Connick.  Connick, however, never showed the report to Cotnoir;  nor did anyone else.  No one ever informed Cotnoir of the substance of Randall's interviews with his colleagues.  Nor did anyone otherwise tell Cotnoir what in essence the evidence against him was.  Therefore, Cotnoir had no way to know what the extent of the evidence was, what his alleged role in the whole scheme was, and the seriousness with which the UMA viewed the incident.  Cotnoir therefore did not have an opportunity to respond to, or defend himself against the evidence presented.  A reasonable official should have known that this failure to explain the evidence against an individual violated one of the basic procedural due process requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. The Post-Termination Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The individual defendants argue that Cotnoir's procedural due process rights were not violated because post-deprivation procedures were available to ensure that Cotnoir's termination was appropriate, and that he, in fact, received the benefit of these procedural protections.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where an employee is fired in violation of his due process rights, the availability of post-termination grievance procedures will not ordinarily cure the violation.

Thus, even where a discharged employee receives a post-termination hearing to review adverse personnel action, the pretermination hearing still needs to be extensive enough to guard against mistaken decisions, and accordingly, the employee is entitled to notice, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story.  See Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 546, 105 S.Ct. at 1495;  Brasslett, 761 F.2d at 836.   If an employee is fired without these pre-termination protections, normally the constitutional deprivation is then complete.  Kercado-Melendez, 829 F.2d at 263.   Thus, the post-termination grievance procedures which the individual defendants provided to Cotnoir could not compensate for a lack of pre-termination process afforded Cotnoir.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not believe on the facts now appearing in the record, that it was reasonable for the individual defendants to have believed that their actions satisfied the minimum due process requirements.

On October 29, 1991, another professor at the UMA, Ronald Norton, sent a letter to the dean of students indicating that a BAGS student had received 56 credits without having attended classes.  Norton's letter further indicated that this particular student was registered as a Maine resident, although he was living in Louisiana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the letter, Richard Randall, the Provost at the UMA, conducted an investigation.  As part of this investigation, Randall interviewed Cotnoir, several of his colleagues, and other individuals with knowledge regarding the incident.  On December 13, 1991, Randall completed his report, and gave it to George Connick, the President of the UMA.  This report contained a summary of Randall's findings regarding this academic matter and included an explicit recommendation that Cotnoir be dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 16, 1991, Connick sent a letter to Cotnoir, which stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Provost Richard Randall has completed his report to me on the investigation of the academic issues raised by Professor Ronald Norton in his letter of October 29, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>I wish to offer you the opportunity to meet with me so that you might further clarify your role in this series of events, prior to my determining what action to take.

During this meeting, Connick explained to Cotnoir that Randall had prepared a report of the investigation.  Connick did not show Cotnoir the report, and Cotnoir apparently did not ask to see the report.  Cotnoir did not make a statement, and Connick then proceeded to ask Cotnoir twelve questions about the BAGS student, which Cotnoir answered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 27, 1991, Connick sent Cotnoir a letter informing him that his employment was terminated effective December 31, 1991.  Cotnoir then filed a grievance regarding the termination.  Connick appointed Sherri Stevens, Executive Director of Administrative Services, to be his designee, and impartially review the matter.  Although Stevens never held a hearing, she met with Cotnoir and his faculty representative three times.  On June 5, 1992, Stevens submitted a report to Connick concluding that the UMA had met its burden of proof that there was sufficient cause to terminate Cotnoir, and that the termination decision should not be reversed.  Connick accepted her report.  At this time, Stevens was also representing the UMA in opposing Cotnoir's request for unemployment benefits before Maine's Department of Labor, on the basis of Cotnoir's alleged misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 17, 1992, Cotnoir filed a grievance with Chancellor Woodbury.  Woodbury appointed Samuel D'Amico, the Associate Vice Chancellor, to review Cotnoir's grievance.  On July 13, 1992, D'Amico notified Cotnoir that his review was limited to a determination of whether proper procedures had been followed.  D'Amico ultimately concluded that Cotnoir's termination was conducted in accordance with the grievance procedures set forth in the UMA's handbook for non-represented employees.  D'Amico notified Cotnoir that he had a right to appeal to the University of Maine System Board of Trustees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cotnoir then waived his right to appeal to the Board of Trustees, and the UMA agreed to this waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Proceedings Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following his termination, Cotnoir filed this action, alleging claims under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, as well as pendent state claims.  The claim which underlies this appeal is that Woodbury, Connick, and Randall, violated Cotnoir's right to procedural due process in conjunction with their decision to terminate his employment.  The individual defendants moved for summary judgment.  In this motion, they claimed, in part, that they were entitled to qualified immunity with respect to Cotnoir's procedural due process claim.  Magistrate Judge Beaulieu issued a recommended decision denying the individual defendants' summary judgment motion on the issue of qualified immunity.

On appeal, Cotnoir suggests that in addition to affirming the district court's denial of qualified immunity below, we should also decree that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on his Sec. 1983 procedural due process claim.  Cotnoir contends that he is entitled to such a judgment because the record is clear regarding the events which occurred with respect to his termination.  We decline Cotnoir's invitation, and adhere to our \"well-established practice of limiting our interlocutory review to the issue of qualified immunity,\" even when the merits of the case are \"inexorably intertwined\" with the qualified immunity issue.

Thus, the central issue with respect to qualified immunity is not whether a defendant actually violated a plaintiff's rights.

The record indicates that Cotnoir initially met with Randall with respect to Randall's investigation into the academic incident, and Cotnoir generally explained what actions he had taken relative to this incident, and why he had taken those actions.  After completing his investigation, Randall prepared a report, and submitted it to Connick.  In that report, Randall set forth his findings based on his investigation, and recommended that Cotnoir be fired.  Connick then invited Cotnoir to meet with him so that Cotnoir could \"clarify [his] role in this series of events,\" and Connick alerted Cotnoir that unspecified \"disciplinary action\" could result.  Cotnoir met with Connick, at which time Connick asked Cotnoir to explain his role, and Connick asked him a series of questions.  Connick did not show Cotnoir the report, or otherwise alert Cotnoir to the fact that he was considering terminating his employment.  Thus, despite the fact that Connick knew that Randall had recommended termination, and that this action was clearly being contemplated, the individual defendants never provided Cotnoir with any notice of this proposed action.  The decision of whether or not to terminate Cotnoir's employment was the very decision which would deprive Cotnoir of his property interest, and the individual defendants reasonably should have known that they were required to provide Cotnoir with notice of their proposed action and an opportunity to contest their contemplated action, so that Cotnoir's participation in the process could be meaningful.

Based on the present record, it appears that the individual defendants failed to provide Cotnoir with an explanation of their evidence against him regarding the academic incident in question.  During the course of his investigation, Randall met with Cotnoir, as well as a number of Cotnoir's colleagues and people who were otherwise involved, to determine precisely what had occurred.  Randall summarized his investigation in the report which he submitted to Connick.  Connick, however, never showed the report to Cotnoir;  nor did anyone else.  No one ever informed Cotnoir of the substance of Randall's interviews with his colleagues.  Nor did anyone otherwise tell Cotnoir what in essence the evidence against him was.  Therefore, Cotnoir had no way to know what the extent of the evidence was, what his alleged role in the whole scheme was, and the seriousness with which the UMA viewed the incident.  Cotnoir therefore did not have an opportunity to respond to, or defend himself against the evidence presented.  A reasonable official should have known that this failure to explain the evidence against an individual violated one of the basic procedural due process requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F.

Thus, even where a discharged employee receives a post-termination hearing to review adverse personnel action, the pretermination hearing still needs to be extensive enough to guard against mistaken decisions, and accordingly, the employee is entitled to notice, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story.
