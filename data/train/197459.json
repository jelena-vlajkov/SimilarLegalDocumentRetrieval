Appellant Kenneth Leon Meader\r\n\nwas convicted on all  three counts of an indictment charging  him\r\n\nwith distributing cocaine,  using a firearm in connection with  a\r\n\ndrug trafficking  crime,  and being  a felon-in-possession  of  a\r\n\nfirearm. \r                   \r                   He \r                     essentially \r                                 raises two claims on appeal, one involving\r\n\npossible juror bias and the other concerning his sentencing as  a\r\n\ncareer criminal  based on prior  convictions for unlawful  sexual\r\n\ncontact and intercourse with  a minor.  After careful review,  we\r\n\naffirm.\r\n\n                      I. Factual Background\r\n\n     The \r                  facts \r                        of \r                          the \r                              crime \r                                    are largely irrelevant to the issues we\r\n\nface \r              on \r                 appeal, and we therefore do not recite them in any detail.\r\n\nIt suffices to say that,  viewing the evidence in the light  most\r\n\nfavorable  to the  prosecution, the  jury could  have found  that\r\n\nappellant \r                   abducted \r                           the \r                               mother of his young son at gunpoint from her\r\n\nparents' \r                  home, \r                        took \r                            her \r                                to the house they had shared, forced her to\r\n\ningest \r                cocaine and sleeping pills, and assaulted her sexually.  He\r\n\neventually released her, and surrendered to authorities.  \r\n\n     The jury returned its guilty verdicts on March 27, 1996.  On\r\n\nApril 19, defense counsel advised the court that he had  received\r\n\ninformation about a  juror that suggested  that she possibly  was\r\n\nbiased.  A defense  witness, Decato, had spoken with the  juror's\r\n\nson,  who reported  that  his mother  had  a history  of  abusive\r\n\nrelationships and consequently  was \"dead  set against\"  domestic\r\n\nabusers. \r                   \r                   The \r                      son \r                          also \r                               told Decato that once his mother made up her\r\n\nmind she would not change it.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n     Before trial,  Meader had submitted  six proposed voir  dire\r\n\nquestions, four of which pertained to domestic abuse.1  The court\r\n\nreframed them into a single question:\r\n\n     There \r                    may \r                        be \r                           evidence in this case concerning a domestic\r\n     relationship  in which  physical  force  or  abuse  was\r\n     involved or threatened.   Does any member of the  panel\r\n     have personal views or personal experiences that  would\r\n     prevent you from deciding this type of case fairly  and\r\n     impartially?\r\n\nNo juror responded.\r\n\n     In \r                 a \r                   conference with counsel following revelation of Decato's\r\n\nconversation, the district court  identified two issues: did  the\r\n\njuror \r               prejudge the case, and did she answer the voir dire question\r\n\nfalsely? \r                   \r                   Attempting to adhere to First Circuit authority strongly\r\n\ndisfavoring direct  contact  with jurors,  see United  States  v.\r\n\nKepreos\r                , \r                  759 \r                     F.2d \r                          961, \r                               967 (1st Cir. 1985), the court determined to\r\n\nhear testimony first from Decato, then from the juror's son, and,\r\n\nonly \r              if \r                 questions remained, from the juror.  Further reflection by\r\n\nboth \r              court \r                    and \r                       counsel \r                               following Decato's testimony and a review of\r\n\nthe voir  dire transcript  led, however,  to a  decision to  hear\r\n\ndirectly from the juror rather than her son.\r\n\n      1  The four questions  proposed by Meader  on the issue  of\r\ndomestic violence were as follows:\r\n\n     1. Have you been involved in a domestic relationship in\r\n     which physical force or abuse was involved?\r\n     2. Has  a relative  of yours,  or a  close friend  been\r\n     involved in a  domestic relationship in which  physical\r\n     force was used, or was claimed to have been used?\r\n     3. Have you been involved in a domestic relationship in\r\n     which \r                    the \r                        threat \r                              of \r                                 physical force or abuse was involved?\r\n     4. Has  a relative  of yours,  or a  close friend  been\r\n     involved in a domestic relationship in which the threat\r\n     of physical force or abuse was used, or claimed to have\r\n     been used?\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n     The \r                  juror, \r                         Sandra Petersen, was questioned by the court in an\r\n\ninformal session.   Both counsel were  present and had  submitted\r\n\nproposed \r                  questions, but they were asked to remain at the periphery\r\n\nof the proceeding  \"to maintain a certain level of  informality.\"\r\n\nJuror Petersen  acknowledged that  she had  been emotionally  and\r\n\nverbally abused  by an  ex-husband,  and that  her son  had  been\r\n\nphysically abused by the same man.  She further acknowledged that\r\n\nshe does not  like abusers, but  emphatically rejected her  son's\r\n\nsuggestion to Decato that she had her mind made up about the case\r\n\nbefore its conclusion.  She responded to the court's question  on\r\n\nthat point as follows:\r\n\n     What? No way.  No way.   He -- he must have  fabricated\r\n     that because no way.  No, I -- in fact, I told him that\r\n     it \r                 would \r                       take \r                           awhile \r                                  for \r                                      me to -- to come to the decision\r\n     because \r                      it's \r                           a \r                            man's \r                                  life is what I said.  And that's the\r\n     way I feel about any case.  You know, I'm -- I've got a\r\n     man's life here in my hands.  There's no way I -- no.\r\n\nIn \r            response \r                     to \r                       her \r                           son's \r                                 comment that \"my mother doesn't change her\r\n\nmind once  it's set,\"  she explained that  that was  the way  she\r\n\nhandled him -- \"if I tell him this is it, that's all\" -- and that\r\n\nshe viewed his statement as an attempt \"to pump himself up,  make\r\n\nhimself look big\" because his  mother was a juror for the  trial.\r\n\nAsked \r               if \r                  her \r                      views had any impact on the trial, the juror replied:\r\n\n     I retarded everyone else in the deliberation because  I\r\n     had \r                  a \r                    life \r                         in my hand and I did not know, you know, if I\r\n     should go along with everybody else.  Everyone else was\r\n     going  towards guilty.   I was not.   Because I  waited\r\n     until, \r                     you \r                         know, I heard more about it and more evidence\r\n     and, \r                   you \r                       know, we deliberated before I finally said yes.\r\n\nWhen the court asked if her experiences with her ex-husband\r\n\naffected her attitude toward the trial, she answered:\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n     It did in a way because  I had to really think out  the\r\n     case and say, you know,  is this -- you know, is  there\r\n     abuse here or  is it that  this man has  a -- a  mental\r\n     problem \r                      . \r                        . \r                          . I know a little bit about the psychic mind\r\n     and how it works.   And sometimes when you're under  an\r\n     awful \r                    lot \r                        of \r                          stress \r                                 you \r                                     will do things on the spur of the\r\n     moment.  But the other jurors made me see that this was\r\n     premeditated,\r                            he thought it out before he -- he actually\r\n     did the crime.\r\n\nAdditionally, when  asked  specifically whether  her  experiences\r\n\naffected \r                  her \r                      fairness or impartiality, the juror replied: \"I think\r\n\nI was very  fair because I thought it all out . . . . I  wouldn't\r\n\nmake a judgment on someone unless I really thought something out.\r\n\nAnd \r             I \r               wouldn't let my own personal feelings interfere in any way.\"\r\n\nShe repeated that sentiment when asked whether her personal views\r\n\nmade her more or less sympathetic to either the government or the\r\n\ndefense: \"I went by  what was on the table .  . . . I put my  own\r\n\nfeelings aside.\"\r\n\n     Based on this inquiry, the court tentatively concluded  that\r\n\nneither predisposition nor outside factors influenced the  jury's\r\n\nverdict, but  also asked  for  briefs from  counsel.   The  court\r\n\nrejected \r                  defense \r                         counsel's request that the court also question the\r\n\njuror's son, noting the First Circuit's reluctance to probe  into\r\n\nthe jury process unless absolutely necessary.\r\n\n     On \r                 June \r                      14, \r                          1996, three weeks after the court's exchange with\r\n\nthe juror, Meader moved for a mistrial.  He claimed both that the\r\n\ncourt \r               should \r                      have \r                          used \r                               his proposed voir dire questions, instead of\r\n\nthe court's modification, and that additional investigation  into\r\n\njuror bias was necessary.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n     The \r                  district \r                           court denied the motion in a thoughtful ten-page\r\n\norder, \r                and \r                    we here provide only a summary of its contents.  First,\r\n\nthe court found  no suggestion of  prejudice, observing that  the\r\n\njuror's answers -- which the court found \"logical and believable\"\r\n\n-- \"reveal that, if anything, she gave this defendant the benefit\r\n\nof the doubt.\"   On Meader's claim  that his voir dire  questions\r\n\nshould  have been asked,  the court noted  that no objection  was\r\n\nraised  to the  questions  actually  posed and  no  requests  for\r\n\nadditional questions were made at the time of the voir dire.  The\r\n\nclaim therefore was waived.  Responding to Meader's attack on the\r\n\nadequacy of the investigation into bias, the court noted the need\r\n\nto  avoid undue  intrusion into  jurors' lives,  and stated  that\r\n\ntestimony from the juror's son was unnecessary because the  court\r\n\nhad credited Decato's testimony about what the son told him, even\r\n\nthough Decato had reason to testify so as to make a mistrial more\r\n\nlikely.  \r\n\n     The court sentenced Meader to 120 months in prison on  Count\r\n\nOne (felon-in-possession), to be served concurrently with a  360-\r\n\nmonth term  on Count Two (distribution  of cocaine).  A  60-month\r\n\nconsecutive term, as  required by statute, would follow on  Count\r\n\nThree (use of firearm in drug trafficking crime).  The  penalties\r\n\nreflected increases for  various specific characteristics of  the\r\n\noffenses, including  the abduction of  the victim, commission  of\r\n\ncriminal \r                  sexual abuse, and use of force and threats of death.  The\r\n\npenalty \r                 also \r                      reflected Meader's status as a career offender, based\r\n\non his having two prior convictions for drug or violent crimes.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n     On \r                 appeal, \r                         Meader challenges the district court's handling of\r\n\nthe voir dire and the allegations of juror bias, both relating to\r\n\nthe  domestic  abuse  issue.   He  also  claims  that  his  prior\r\n\nconvictions \r                     for \r                        statutory rape and unlawful sexual contact were not\r\n\ncrimes of violence and thus should not have been used to classify\r\n\nhim as a career offender.\r\n\n          II. Domestic Abuse: Voir Dire and Juror Bias\r\n\n     A. Voir  Dire.  We  need not dwell  on the district  court's\r\n\nfailure \r                 to \r                    ask \r                       verbatim \r                                Meader's proposed voir dire questions.  The\r\n\ncourt had  no obligation  to ask  the questions  in the  specific\r\n\nlanguage \r                  proposed, see United States v. Victoria-Peguero, 920 F.2d\r\n\n77, 84 (1st Cir. 1990), and counsel's acquiescence in the court's\r\n\nreframed \r                  question means that any objection to that formulation was\r\n\nnot preserved for appeal.  See United States v. Walsh, 75 F.3d 1,\r\n\n6 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"[T]he usual rule is that an objection must be\r\n\nmade \r              known \r                    at \r                      the \r                          time \r                               that the court is making its decision to act\r\n\n. \r           . \r             . \r               .\"). \r                     \r                     Because the district court's inquiry -- asking whether\r\n\njurors could impartially judge a case involving domestic violence\r\n\n-- directly  focused on  the  critical concern  of bias,  we  are\r\n\npersuaded beyond any doubt that no plain error occurred.\r\n\n     In so  concluding, we  offer  no view  of the  substance  of\r\n\nMeader's complaint.    He contends  that  the court's  voir  dire\r\n\nquestion, \r                   allowing jurors who were exposed to domestic violence to\r\n\nreveal their experiences  only if they  felt such exposure  would\r\n\nimpact their jury service, deprived him of the ability to use his\r\n\nchallenges \r                    effectively.  Although this position has some force, we\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\ndecline \r                 to \r                   consider \r                            whether, in other circumstances, the failure to\r\n\npose more discerning questions would be reversible error.\r\n\n     B. Juror Bias.  Meader also challenges the district  court's\r\n\napproach and conclusion with respect to the possible bias of  one\r\n\njuror. \r                 \r                 He \r                   particularly \r                                complains about the court's failure to hear\r\n\ntestimony from the juror's son and its prohibiting the  defendant\r\n\nfrom \r              either \r                     directly contacting the son or sending an investigator\r\n\nto \r            interview \r                      him.  Meader asserts that this limitation on the bias\r\n\ninquiry prevented him  from effectively  challenging the  juror's\r\n\n\"self-serving statements  . . .  that she could  and did put  her\r\n\nfeelings about domestic abuse aside in deciding this case.\"\r\n\n     Our  caselaw holds  that  a  district court  is  obliged  to\r\n\ninvestigate plausible allegations of improper influence on a jury\r\n\nverdict, see,  e.g., Walsh,  75  F.3d at  6-7; United  States  v.\r\n\nHunnewell, 891 F.2d 955, 961 (1st Cir. 1989), but that the  court\r\n\nhas \r             \"broad \r                    discretion to determine the type of investigation which\r\n\nmust be mounted,\" United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 258 (1st\r\n\nCir.  1990); see also  Walsh, 75 F.3d  at 7.   In this case,  the\r\n\ncourt's process was a textbook model of conscientiousness, and so\r\n\nfar from  an abuse  of discretion that  it is  difficult to  take\r\n\nMeader's complaint seriously.\r\n\n     The \r                  court \r                       promptly \r                                conferred with counsel about how to proceed\r\n\nwhen alerted to the possible juror taint, it ordered a transcript\r\n\nof the jury selection process so that it could accurately  review\r\n\nthe new information in light of what previously had occurred,  it\r\n\nheard  testimony from  the witness  who had  brought the  juror's\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\npossible bias to the defendant's attention, and it discussed with\r\n\nthe parties how  best to proceed in  keeping with both the  First\r\n\nCircuit's \r                   admonition \r                             against unnecessary juror contact and the need\r\n\nto ferret  out the  juror's true  attitudes.   Indeed, the  court\r\n\novercame \r                  its \r                     reluctance \r                                to question the juror directly in deference\r\n\nto defendant's preference.\r\n\n     The  process of  questioning the  juror also  was marked  by\r\n\ncommendable attention to the various interests at stake.  So that\r\n\nthe  juror would  not  be unduly  alarmed  or prepare  ahead  for\r\n\nquestioning \r                     on the bias issue, she was asked to appear in court by\r\n\nmeans of a  regular jury summons.   The attorneys were given  the\r\n\nopportunity \r                     to submit questions to the court, but were kept on the\r\n\nsidelines \r                   during \r                         the \r                             actual questioning to contain the formality of\r\n\nthe proceeding.  After completing the preliminary questions,  the\r\n\ncourt excused the juror and consulted with counsel about possible\r\n\nadditional \r                    areas of inquiry.  Its rejection of defendant's request\r\n\nto question the son as well, or to allow him to be  questioned by\r\n\ninvestigators, was carefully  considered and  supportable.2   Its\r\n\n     2 On this point, the court wrote, in substantial part:\r\n\n          First, I am crediting the account of Mr. Decato --\r\n     the defendant's employee, witness and boyfriend of  his\r\n     daughter \r                       -- \r                          as to what the young man said to Mr. Decato.\r\n     . . . Second, now that I have interviewed the juror and\r\n     she is  fully aware that  her son is  the cause of  the\r\n     inquiry,  I am concerned  that to bring  her son in  by\r\n     subpoena \r                       or \r                          to \r                            send \r                                 an \r                                    FBI agent and private investigator\r\n     to interview him (as was proposed by the lawyers) would\r\n     unnecessarily  increase the  juror's  apprehension  and\r\n     concern that her son is now in trouble  notwithstanding\r\n     her explanation of  what took place.  Third, to  pursue\r\n     from her son things that the juror may or may not  have\r\n     said to him would be embarking on a fishing  expedition\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nsubstantial written  opinion  fully explained  the basis  of  its\r\n\nconclusions.  \r\n\n     Nor  is  the   court's  finding  that  the  juror  was   not\r\n\nprejudicially biased assailable.  The dialogue between the  court\r\n\nand \r             the \r                 juror \r                      recounted \r                                above reveals that the juror understood her\r\n\nobligation to keep her  own subjective, though related,  feelings\r\n\noutside of  the  deliberation process,  and  that, as  the  court\r\n\nobserved,  she gave  the defendant  \"the benefit  of the  doubt.\"\r\n\nAssessment of  the juror's credibility  as she  responded to  the\r\n\nquestioning is uniquely the domain of the district court, and, to\r\n\nborrow  the government's  language, her  \"clear, responsive,  and\r\n\nforthright  responses  provided   ample  reason  to  credit   her\r\n\nassertions.\"\r\n\n     Thus, we find no basis connected to the court's handling  of\r\n\nthe  domestic  abuse  issue upon  which  to  disturb  the  jury's\r\n\nverdicts.3\r\n\n     contrary to the admonitions of the appellate courts  to\r\n     keep the jury process and the jurors themselves free of\r\n     unnecessary intrusions.  Finally, any interview I might\r\n     conduct of the son  now would clearly be preceded by  a\r\n     frank  and candid  discussion  between juror  and  son,\r\n     thereby making any such interview of limited value.\r\n\nOrder at 4-5.\r\n\n  \r            \r             \r              \r              3\r                \r                We \r                   find no merit in Meader's additional suggestion that the\r\njury as a whole engaged in misconduct by deliberating before  the\r\nconclusion of all the evidence.  The district court's response to\r\nthis contention in  its Order was both adequate and  appropriate.\r\nSee Order at 9-10.\r\n\n                              -10-\r\r\n\n                   III. Career Offender Status\r\n\n     Meader \r                     claims that the district court erred in sentencing him\r\n\nas a career offender  under U.S.S.G. S 4B1.1, which provides  for\r\n\nenhanced sentences if  a defendant's  criminal history  satisfies\r\n\nthree  criteria: (1) he was at least 18 years old at the time  he\r\n\ncommitted the offense for  which he is being sentenced; (2)  that\r\n\noffense \r                 is \r                    a \r                      felony that either constituted a crime of violence or\r\n\na \r           controlled \r                      substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least\r\n\ntwo prior  felony convictions for  either crimes  of violence  or\r\n\ncrimes involving controlled substances.  Meader concedes most  of\r\n\nthese requirements, including one of the two necessary \"predicate\r\n\noffenses.\"4   The only issue in  dispute is whether his  criminal\r\n\nhistory includes a second such offense.\r\n\n     The \r                  district \r                           court \r                                based \r                                      its finding of career offender status\r\n\non two  1988 Maine convictions  for statutory  rape and  unlawful\r\n\nsexual \r                contact \r                        with \r                            a \r                              child under the age of fourteen, finding that\r\n\nthey qualified as \"crimes of violence\" within the meaning of  the\r\n\nguidelines.5  Meader contends that neither was properly  counted.\r\n\nThe issue is  one of law,  and our review  is therefore de  novo.\r\n\nUnited States v. Winter, 22 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n     4  Meader does not dispute that his 1982 conviction for  the\r\nsale of narcotics constitutes such an offense.\r\n\n     5 At some points during the sentencing hearing, the district\r\ncourt seemed to deal with the two offenses as one, and its \"crime\r\nof violence\" determination seemed to apply only to the  statutory\r\nrape conviction.   Whether or not the  court meant its ruling  to\r\ninclude \r                 both \r                     convictions \r                                 does not matter for purposes of this case,\r\nhowever, since only  one additional offense is needed to  trigger\r\ncareer offender status. \r\n\n                              -11-\r\r\n\n     A \"crime of violence\"  under the guidelines is any state  or\r\n\nfederal offense punishable by a year or more in prison that\r\n\n      (i)  has as  an  element the  use, attempted  use,  or\r\n     threatened use of physical force against the person  of\r\n     another, or (ii)  is burglary of a dwelling, arson,  or\r\n     extortion, involves  use  of explosives,  or  otherwise\r\n     involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk\r\n     of physical injury to another.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.  S  4B1.2(1).   Application  note  2  to  the  provision\r\n\nelaborates on  the  meaning of  \"crime  of violence\"  by  listing\r\n\nadditional crimes that fall  within its scope, including  murder,\r\n\nmanslaughter, kidnapping, and forcible sex offenses.\r\n\n     Because neither of the two Maine sexual offenses includes as\r\n\nan element the use or threat of physical force,6 it is undisputed\r\n\nthat in order to qualify  as \"crimes of violence\" they must  fall\r\n\nunder \r               the \r                   \"otherwise\" clause of S 4B1.2, and therefore be offenses\r\n\nthat present \"a serious potential risk of physical injury.\"   The\r\n\ndistrict court, noting that the requisite risk is of any physical\r\n\ninjury, found that \"there is a strong likelihood of some physical\r\n\ninjury, \r                 however minor the injury might be in the range of possible\r\n\nphysical injuries  that can  happen  to a  human body  in  sexual\r\n\nintercourse \r                     with \r                         a \r                           13-year-old female.\"  The court drew support for\r\n\nits \r             conclusion from a Maine Supreme Court case, State v. Rundlett,\r\n\n     6 The two offenses were denominated as  rape, Me. Rev. Stat.\r\nAnn. tit. 17-A, S 252, and unlawful sexual contact, id. at S 255.\r\nThe conviction for rape required  the jury to find only that  the\r\ndefendant had engaged in sexual intercourse with another  person,\r\nnot his  spouse, who was  not yet fourteen.   The conviction  for\r\nunlawful sexual  contact similarly  required a  finding that  the\r\ndefendant had subjected another person, not his spouse, to sexual\r\ncontact when that other person was not yet fourteen and he was at\r\nleast three years older.\r\n\n                              -12-\r\r\n\n391 A.2d 815 (1978), that linked passage of the state's statutory\r\n\nrape provision to a concern about physical injury to young girls,\r\n\nid.                    d medical literature on injuries caused to\r\n\nyoung adolescent females by sexual intercourse with adult males.7\r\n\nThus, combining  its  own  perceptions with  this  precedent  and\r\n\nsupporting material,  the  district  court held  that  the  Maine\r\n\nconvictions triggered career offender status.\r\n\n     M\r             \r             at \r                819, \r                    and \r                        that \r                             cite\r                eader \r                     takes \r                           issue \r                                with \r                                     this finding on multiple fronts.   His\r\n\nprimary argument is that the district court failed to follow  the\r\n\nwell \r              established \"categorical\" approach for deciding the \"crime of\r\n\nviolence\" \r                   issue, see, e.g., Winter, 22 F.3d at 18, and that, if it\r\n\nhad, \r              its \r                  conclusion would have been different.  He emphasizes that\r\n\nthe  rape statute  embraces a  wide variety  of consensual  acts,\r\n\nincluding \r                   those between two individuals who are both under the age\r\n\nof  fourteen,   and   imposes  liability   without   culpability.\r\n\nConsequently, he  asserts, many,  if not  most, circumstances  of\r\n\nstatutory rape  would not  involve a  likelihood of  the sort  of\r\n\naccompanying violence  that was targeted  by the career  offender\r\n\nguideline.  Therefore, viewed from a categorical perspective,  he\r\n\nmaintains \r                   that statutory rape under Maine law cannot be classified\r\n\nas a crime of violence. \r\n\n     The sentencing court's inquiry is not as confined as  Meader\r\n\nposits \r                it \r                   to \r                      be.  Meader is correct that the standard approach for\r\n\n     7  Quoting from a 1977 article in a clinical obstetrics  and\r\ngynecological journal, the Maine court reported: \"'These injuries\r\nare  most  frequently   minor  and  include  abrasions,   hymenal\r\ntransections, first-degree vaginal  tears, and perianal  tears.'\"\r\nState v. Rundlett, 391 A.2d 815, 819 (1978).\r\n\n                              -13-\r\r\n\ndetermining whether a particular crime fits within the \"crime  of\r\n\nviolence\" rubric is a generic one, in which inquiry is restricted\r\n\nt           ory definitions of the prior offenses, without regard\r\n\n   the  particular facts underlying  them, see  Taylor v.  United\r\n\nStates, 495 U.S. 575, 600 (1990);8 Winter, 22 F.3d at 18;  United\r\n\nStates v.  DeJesus, 984  F.2d  21, 23  (1st Cir.  1993)  (\"formal\r\n\ncategorical \r                     approach \r                              . \r                               . \r                                 . is the method of choice\" for determining\r\n\n\"crime \r                of \r                   violence\").  Thus, in United States v. Doe, 960 F.2d 221\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1992), we concluded that the crime of being a felon  in\r\n\npossession of a firearm was  not a crime of violence despite  the\r           o \r            the \r                statut\r          to\r\n\nfact \r              that \r                   the defendant in that case possessed the gun while lying\r\n\nin \r            wait \r                 for \r                     an enemy to come out of a restaurant.  This conclusion\r\n\nwas warranted  under the  formal categorical  approach, we  held,\r\n\nbecause the conduct that typically constitutes firearm possession\r\n\n(keeping  a gun in a  closet, a car, a  pocket) is not likely  to\r\n\ninclude accompanying violence.  Id. at 224-25.\r\n\n     Application  Note 2  to  guideline section  4B1.2,  however,\r\n\nexplicitly \r                    identifies the defendant's charged conduct, rather than\r\n\n     8  Taylor involved the definition of a \"violent felony\"  for\r\npurposes  of the Armed  Career Criminal Act  (ACCA), 18 U.S.C.

He emphasizes  that\r\n\nthis result  is  consistent with  the  intent of  the  Sentencing\r\n\nCommission, \r                     which \r                          listed \r                                 sexual offenses as crimes of violence only\r\n\nwhen \r              they \r                   were \"forcible.\"  See supra at 12.

Although the use  of force in virtually  every\r\n\ninstance could be expected to create a serious risk of injury, it\r\n\nis not the only way in which the guideline standard could be met.\r\n\nThe age of the girl and the chronological gap between her and the\r\n\ndefendant were crucial facts that framed the nature of the crime,\r\n\nand were relevant to the question of injury.10\r\n\n     Other circuits  have treated the  issue in similar  fashion,\r\n\nlinking \r                 their determinations that sexual contact with a minor is a\r\n\ncrime of violence to the specific age of the victim.  See,  e.g.,\r\n\nUnited \r                States v. Shannon, 110 F.3d 382, 388-89 (7th Cir. 1997) (en\r\n\nbanc) (limiting holding to thirteen-year-olds and younger, though\r\n\nstatute \r                 applied \r                        to \r                           persons under the age of sixteen); Wood, 52 F.3d\r\n\nat 275  (accepting  government argument  that \"anytime  an  adult\r\n\nengages in sexual  contact with a four  year old child, there  is\r\n\n     10 We recognize that the specific age disparity is stated in\r\nthe unlawful sexual contact count, not in the rape count.

If commonsense is inadequate to establish\r\n\nthat there is a strong likelihood of some physical injury when  a\r\n\nthirteen-year-old girl has sexual  intercourse with a man  nearly\r\n\nthree times  her age, the medical  literature cited by the  Maine\r\n\nSupreme Court substantiating that view completes the support.12\r\n\n     11 Rodriguez involved enhanced punishment for illegal  entr\r          v.           , 979  F.2d  138,  140 (8th  Cir.  1992)  (involving\r          lascivious acts with children \"of the tender age of ten\").

See generally Taylor,  495 U.S. at 587  (enhancement\r\nprovision in ACCA focused on \"those who commit a large number  of\r\nfairly serious crimes as their means of livelihood\").  First, the\r\nlanguage of the \"otherwise\" clause is broadly written, presumably\r\nto ensure capture of any crime posing a serious risk of  physical\r\ninjury.

Moreover, not all such\r\nstatutes \r                  are \r                      justified by the risk of physical injury.  Id.  As we\r\nindicate  below,  these inconsistencies  call  for  action  at  a\r\npolicymaking level.\r\n\n     14 In holding that the sexual assault by an almost eighteen-\r\nyear-old against  an  almost  fourteen-year-old was  a  crime  of\r\nviolence, the majority of the en banc court focused primarily  on\r\nthe  risk of  pregnancy or  disease.   110  F.3d at  388.   In  a\r\nconcurrence, Judge Manion, joined by Judge Kanne, stated his view\r\nthat \r              \"the \r                   risk \r                       of \r                          physical injury referred to in the Guideline must\r\nbe  confined  to  the  act  of  intercourse,  not  the   possible\r\nconsequences \r                      that \r                          could \r                                develop, such as pregnancy or disease.\" Id.\r\nat 390. \r\n\n                              -19-\r\r\n\nresolve \r                 in \r                    the first instance,15\r\n\n       of cases in this area, should be handled expeditiously  b\r\n\n           Meader argues that, in the meantime, we should  invoke\r\n\n            courts deciding that sexual offenses involving minors\r                                          and that, in light of the growing\r          number                                                          y\r          the Sentencing Commission and Congress.

It should be noted that the first two cases  involved\r\nthe \r             definition of \"crime of violence\" contained in 18 U.S.C. S 16,\r\nfocusing \r                  on \r                     the \r                        risk \r                             of \r                                physical force rather than physical injury.\r\nThe third case, Bauer, is  a brief per curiam that relied  almost\r\nentirely \r                  on \r                     the \r                        Eighth \r                               Circuit's earlier decision in Rodriguez, 979\r\nF.2d  at 140,  which was  more circumscribed  (question of  first\r\nimpression whether commission of lascivious acts with a child, in\r\nthe manner Rodriguez admits he committed the crime, qualifies  as\r\ncrime of violence).\r\n     Other  courts,  as  noted  earlier,  have  referred  to  the\r\ndefendant's specific conduct and/or focused on the minor's age in\r\nreaching their conclusions.  See, e.g., United States v. Shannon,\r\n110 F.3d 382, 389  (7th Cir. 1997) (en banc) (sexual  intercourse\r\nwith a 13-year-old  is a crime of violence; statute  criminalized\r\nsexual contact or intercourse with child under 16); United States\r\nv. Taylor,  98 F.3d  768,  773-74 (3d  Cir. 1996)  (holding  that\r\nindecent exposure was crime of violence based on facts alleged in\r\nindictment  showing  that  victim was  \"forced  onto  a  bed  and\r\nrestrained while [defendant] commit[ted] a sexual act upon her\");\r\nWood, 52 F.3d at 275 (sexual contact with a four-year-old  always\r\nposes serious risk of violence).\r\n\n     16 In Shannon, the en banc Seventh Circuit, in reversing the\r\npanel's 2-1 ruling that the district court had erred in enhancing\r\nthe \r             defendant's sentence based on a previous conviction for sexual\r\nassault, \r                  recognized the difficulty of the issue and observed \"[w]e\r\ncannot \r                be \r                   certain that we have gotten it right.\"  110 F.3d at 389.\r\nThe panel majority had  emphasized the fact that the prior  crime\r\ninvolved  intercourse  between  two  teenagers,  the  17-year-old\r\n\n                              -20-\r\r\n\nthe \r             rule \r                  of \r                    lenity \r                           to \r                              exclude his conviction from predicate offense\r\n\n         It is unnecessary to do so.  Whatever the dividing  line\r\n\nbetw\r          status.\r              een sexual  offenses that constitute  crimes of violence  and\r\n\nthose that do not,  we are confident that the circumstances  here\r\n\nfall well within the \"crime of violence\" category.  \r\n\n     We therefore hold that, because defendant's conviction under\r\n\nMaine's \r                 statutory \r                          rape \r                               law involved conduct that created a \"serious\r\n\npotential risk  of  physical  injury to  another,\"  that  offense\r\n\nqualifies as  a crime of  violence under  the federal  sentencing\r\n\nguidelines.  Meader thus having two such convictions, he properly\r\n\nwas sentenced as a career offender.\r\n\n     Affirmed. \r\n\ndefendant and a  13-year-old girl, and  stated that such  conduct\r\nbetween \r                 two \r                     minors cannot automatically be deemed violent.  See 94\r\nF.3d 1065, 1072 (7th Cir. 1996).\r\n\n                              -21-\r\n",

He essentially raises two claims on appeal, one involving possible juror bias and the other concerning his sentencing as a career criminal based on prior convictions for unlawful sexual contact and intercourse with a minor.  After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of the crime are largely irrelevant to the issues we face on appeal, and we therefore do not recite them in any detail.  It suffices to say that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the jury could have found that appellant abducted the mother of his young son at gunpoint from her parents' home, took her to the house they had shared, forced her to ingest cocaine and sleeping pills, and assaulted her sexually.  He eventually released her, and surrendered to authorities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury returned its guilty verdicts on March 27, 1996.  On April 19, defense counsel advised the court that he had received information about a juror that suggested that she possibly was biased.  A defense witness, Decato, had spoken with the juror's son, who reported that his mother had a history of abusive relationships and consequently was \"dead set against\" domestic abusers.  The son also told Decato that once his mother made up her mind she would not change it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial, Meader had submitted six proposed voir dire questions, four of which pertained to domestic abuse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>  The court reframed them into a single question:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>There may be evidence in this case concerning a domestic relationship in which physical force or abuse was involved or threatened.  Does any member of the panel have personal views or personal experiences that would prevent you from deciding this type of case fairly and impartially?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No juror responded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a conference with counsel following revelation of Decato's conversation, the district court identified two issues:  did the juror prejudge the case, and did she answer the voir dire question falsely?   Attempting to adhere to First Circuit authority strongly disfavoring direct contact with jurors, see United States v. Kepreos, 759 F.2d 961, 967 (1st Cir.1985), the court determined to hear testimony first from Decato, then from the juror's son, and, only if questions remained, from the juror.  Further reflection by both court and counsel following Decato's testimony and a review of the voir dire transcript led, however, to a decision to hear directly from the juror rather than her son.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The juror, Sandra Petersen, was questioned by the court in an informal session.  Both counsel were present and had submitted proposed questions, but they were asked to remain at the periphery of the proceeding \"to maintain a certain level of informality.\"   Juror Petersen acknowledged that she had been emotionally and verbally abused by an ex-husband, and that her son had been physically abused by the same man.  She further acknowledged that she does not like abusers, but emphatically rejected her son's suggestion to Decato that she had her mind made up about the case before its conclusion.  She responded to the court's question on that point as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>What?  No way.  No way.  He--he must have fabricated that because no way.  No, I--in fact, I told him that it would take awhile for me to--to come to the decision because it's a man's life is what I said.  And that's the way I feel about any case.  You know, I'm--I've got a man's life here in my hands.  There's no way I--no.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to her son's comment that \"my mother doesn't change her mind once it's set,\" she explained that that was the way she handled him--\"if I tell him this is it, that's all\"--and that she viewed his statement as an attempt \"to pump himself up, make himself look big\" because his mother was a juror for the trial.  Asked if her views had any impact on the trial, the juror replied:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>I retarded everyone else in the deliberation because I had a life in my hand and I did not know, you know, if I should go along with everybody else.  Everyone else was going towards guilty.  I was not.  Because I waited until, you know, I heard more about it and more evidence and, you know, we deliberated before I finally said yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the court asked if her experiences with her ex-husband affected her attitude toward the trial, she answered:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>It did in a way because I had to really think out the case and say, you know, is this--you know, is there abuse here or is it that this man has a--a mental problem ... I know a little bit about the psychic mind and how it works.  And sometimes when you're under an awful lot of stress you will do things on the spur of the moment.  But the other jurors made me see that this was premeditated, he thought it out before he--he actually did the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, when asked specifically whether her experiences affected her fairness or impartiality, the juror replied:  \"I think I was very fair because I thought it all out....  I wouldn't make a judgment on someone unless I really thought something out.  And I wouldn't let my own personal feelings interfere in any way.\"   She repeated that sentiment when asked whether her personal views made her more or less sympathetic to either the government or the defense:  \"I went by what was on the table....  I put my own feelings aside.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this inquiry, the court tentatively concluded that neither predisposition nor outside factors influenced the jury's verdict, but also asked for briefs from counsel.  The court rejected defense counsel's request that the court also question the juror's son, noting the First Circuit's reluctance to probe into the jury process unless absolutely necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 14, 1996, three weeks after the court's exchange with the juror, Meader moved for a mistrial.  He claimed both that the court should have used his proposed voir dire questions, instead of the court's modification, and that additional investigation into juror bias was necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the motion in a thoughtful ten-page order, and we here provide only a summary of its contents.  First, the court found no suggestion of prejudice, observing that the juror's answers--which the court found \"logical and believable\"--\"reveal that, if anything, she gave this defendant the benefit of the doubt.\"   On Meader's claim that his voir dire questions should have been asked, the court noted that no objection was raised to the questions actually posed and no requests for additional questions were made at the time of the voir dire.   The claim therefore was waived.  Responding to Meader's attack on the adequacy of the investigation into bias, the court noted the need to avoid undue intrusion into jurors' lives, and stated that testimony from the juror's son was unnecessary because the court had credited Decato's testimony about what the son told him, even though Decato had reason to testify so as to make a mistrial more likely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court sentenced Meader to 120 months in prison on Count One (felon-in-possession), to be served concurrently with a 360-month term on Count Two (distribution of cocaine).  A 60-month consecutive term, as required by statute, would follow on Count Three (use of firearm in drug trafficking crime).  The penalties reflected increases for various specific characteristics of the offenses, including the abduction of the victim, commission of criminal sexual abuse, and use of force and threats of death.  The penalty also reflected Meader's status as a career offender, based on his having two prior convictions for drug or violent crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Meader challenges the district court's handling of the voir dire and the allegations of juror bias, both relating to the domestic abuse issue.  He also claims that his prior convictions for statutory rape and unlawful sexual contact were not crimes of violence and thus should not have been used to classify him as a career offender.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>II. Domestic Abuse:  Voir Dire and Juror Bias</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Voir Dire.  We need not dwell on the district court's failure to ask verbatim Meader's proposed voir dire questions.  The court had no obligation to ask the questions in the specific language proposed, see United States v. Victoria-Peguero, 920 F.2d 77, 84 (1st Cir.1990), and counsel's acquiescence in the court's reframed question means that any objection to that formulation was not preserved for appeal.  See United States v. Walsh, 75 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1996) (\"[T]he usual rule is that an objection must be made known at the time that the court is making its decision to act....\").  Because the district court's inquiry--asking whether jurors could impartially judge a case involving domestic violence--directly focused on the critical concern of bias, we are persuaded beyond any doubt that no plain error occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In so concluding, we offer no view of the substance of Meader's complaint.  He contends that the court's voir dire question, allowing jurors who were exposed to domestic violence to reveal their experiences only if they felt such exposure would impact their jury service, deprived him of the ability to use his challenges effectively.  Although this position has some force, we decline to consider whether, in other circumstances, the failure to pose more discerning questions would be reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Juror Bias.  Meader also challenges the district court's approach and conclusion with respect to the possible bias of one juror.  He particularly complains about the court's failure to hear testimony from the juror's son and its prohibiting the defendant from either directly contacting the son or sending an investigator to interview him.  Meader asserts that this limitation on the bias inquiry prevented him from effectively challenging the juror's \"self-serving statements ... that she could and did put her feelings about domestic abuse aside in deciding this case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our caselaw holds that a district court is obliged to investigate plausible allegations of improper influence on a jury verdict, see, e.g., Walsh, 75 F.3d at 6-7;  United States v. Hunnewell, 891 F.2d 955, 961 (1st Cir.1989), but that the court has \"broad discretion to determine the type of investigation which must be mounted,\" United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 258 (1st Cir.1990);  see also Walsh, 75 F.3d at 7. In this case, the court's process was a textbook model of conscientiousness, and so far from an abuse of discretion that it is difficult to take Meader's complaint seriously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court promptly conferred with counsel about how to proceed when alerted to the possible juror taint, it ordered a transcript of the jury selection process so that it could accurately review the new information in light of what previously had occurred, it heard testimony from the witness who had brought the juror's possible bias to the defendant's attention, and it discussed with the parties how best to proceed in keeping with both the First Circuit's admonition against unnecessary juror contact and the need to ferret out the juror's true attitudes.  Indeed, the court overcame its reluctance to question the juror directly in deference to defendant's preference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The process of questioning the juror also was marked by commendable attention to the various interests at stake.  So that the juror would not be unduly alarmed or prepare ahead for questioning on the bias issue, she was asked to appear in court by means of a regular jury summons.  The attorneys were given the opportunity to submit questions to the court, but were kept on the sidelines during the actual questioning to contain the formality of the proceeding.  After completing the preliminary questions, the court excused the juror and consulted with counsel about possible additional areas of inquiry.  Its rejection of defendant's request to question the son as well, or to allow him to be questioned by investigators, was carefully considered and supportable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a>  Its substantial written opinion fully explained the basis of its conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is the court's finding that the juror was not prejudicially biased assailable.  The dialogue between the court and the juror recounted above reveals that the juror understood her obligation to keep her own subjective, though related, feelings outside of the deliberation process, and that, as the court observed, she gave the defendant \"the benefit of the doubt.\"   Assessment of the juror's credibility as she responded to the questioning is uniquely the domain of the district court, and, to borrow the government's language, her \"clear, responsive, and forthright responses provided ample reason to credit her assertions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we find no basis connected to the court's handling of the domestic abuse issue upon which to disturb the jury's verdicts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

Meader concedes most of these requirements, including one of the two necessary \"predicate offenses.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a>  The only issue in dispute is whether his criminal history includes a second such offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court based its finding of career offender status on two 1988 Maine convictions for statutory rape and unlawful sexual contact with a child under the age of fourteen, finding that they qualified as \"crimes of violence\" within the meaning of the guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Meader contends that neither was properly counted.  The issue is one of law, and our review is therefore de novo.  United States v.

Rundlett, 391 A.2d 815 (1978), that linked passage of the state's statutory rape provision to a concern about physical injury to young girls, id. at 819, and that cited medical literature on injuries caused to young adolescent females by sexual intercourse with adult males.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Thus, combining its own perceptions with this precedent and supporting material, the district court held that the Maine convictions triggered career offender status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meader takes issue with this finding on multiple fronts.  His primary argument is that the district court failed to follow the well established \"categorical\" approach for deciding the \"crime of violence\" issue, see, e.g., Winter, 22 F.3d at 18, and that, if it had, its conclusion would have been different.  He emphasizes that the rape statute embraces a wide variety of consensual acts, including those between two individuals who are both under the age of fourteen, and imposes liability without culpability.  Consequently, he asserts, many, if not most, circumstances of statutory rape would not involve a likelihood of the sort of accompanying violence that was targeted by the career offender guideline.  Therefore, viewed from a categorical perspective, he maintains that statutory rape under Maine law cannot be classified as a crime of violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court's inquiry is not as confined as Meader posits it to be.  Meader is correct that the standard approach for determining whether a particular crime fits within the \"crime of violence\" rubric is a generic one, in which inquiry is restricted to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, without regard to the particular facts underlying them, see Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Winter, 22 F.3d at 18;  United States v. DeJesus, 984 F.2d 21, 23 (1st Cir.1993) (\"formal categorical approach ... is the method of choice\" for determining \"crime of violence\").  Thus, in United States v. Doe, 960 F.2d 221 (1st Cir.1992), we concluded that the crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm was not a crime of violence despite the fact that the defendant in that case possessed the gun while lying in wait for an enemy to come out of a restaurant.  This conclusion was warranted under the formal categorical approach, we held, because the conduct that typically constitutes firearm possession (keeping a gun in a closet, a car, a pocket) is not likely to include accompanying violence.  Id. at 224-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Application Note 2 to guideline section 4B1.2, however, explicitly identifies the defendant's charged conduct, rather than the general offense category, as the focus of the \"otherwise\" clause.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2, comment.  (n.2) (directing attention to \"the conduct set forth (i.e., expressly charged) in the count of which the defendant was convicted\").  The district court therefore was explicitly authorized to review the charging papers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meader's focus on a categorical analysis is not entirely off the mark, however, because even when inquiry beyond the statutory language is appropriate, we have held that the scrutiny should remain categorical rather than become fact-specific, see Winter, 22 F.3d at 19:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>[T]he court should not plunge into the details of a particular defendant's conduct, but, rather ... should merely assess the nature ... of the ... activity as described in the indictment and fleshed out in the jury instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accord United States v. Wood, 52 F.3d 272, 275 (9th Cir.1995).  This is what the district court did.  Using only the facts contained in the indictment, the court identified the issue before it as \"whether sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old female or sexual touching of a 13-year-old female by a 36-year-old male ... 'by its nature presented a serious potential risk of physical injury' to the 13-year-old female.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This careful articulation of the question provides the target for Meader's second-tier assault on the court's methodology.  He argues that, assuming the court acted properly in referring at all to the indictment, it was improper to rely on factors as specific as the victim's gender and the age disparity between the two individuals.  He points out that the statute is gender neutral, and that the specific age difference was irrelevant to the conviction (beyond the three-year gap required by the sexual contact offense).  Focusing too narrowly, Meader contends, will inject disparity back into the sentencing procedure, undermining the rationale of consistency that supports the categorical approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Meader's view, therefore, once scrutiny of the charging papers revealed no allegation of force, a categorical analysis required the conclusion that this conviction was not a violent crime within the meaning of the Guidelines.  He emphasizes that this result is consistent with the intent of the Sentencing Commission, which listed sexual offenses as crimes of violence only when they were \"forcible.\"   See supra at 12.   Indeed, he maintains that using a conviction for underage sexual relations without that requirement \"runs contrary to the stated purpose of the act, to focus law enforcement efforts on 'those who commit a large number of fairly serious crimes as their means of livelihood.' \"   Appellant's Brief at 45 (citing Taylor, 495 U.S. at 587, 110 S.Ct. at 2152).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not accept the proposition that the guidelines permit no more refined scrutiny than an examination of whether the charging documents (or jury instructions) include an explicit allegation of force.  The question for the sentencing court here was whether the defendant's conduct, by its nature, posed a serious risk of physical injury.  Although the use of force in virtually every instance could be expected to create a serious risk of injury, it is not the only way in which the guideline standard could be met.  The age of the girl and the chronological gap between her and the defendant were crucial facts that framed the nature of the crime, and were relevant to the question of injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other circuits have treated the issue in similar fashion, linking their determinations that sexual contact with a minor is a crime of violence to the specific age of the victim.  See, e.g., United States v. Shannon, 110 F.3d 382, 388-89 (7th Cir.1997) (en banc ) (limiting holding to thirteen-year-olds and younger, though statute applied to persons under the age of sixteen);  Wood, 52 F.3d at 275 (accepting government argument that \"anytime an adult engages in sexual contact with a four year old child, there is always a serious potential risk of physical injury\");  United States v. Rodriguez, 979 F.2d 138, 140 (8th Cir.1992) (involving lascivious acts with children \"of the tender age of ten\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The license to focus at that level of particularity seems inherent in the sentencing court's authority to evaluate the conduct \"expressly charged.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having approved the district court's procedure, we can easily endorse its conclusion.  If commonsense is inadequate to establish that there is a strong likelihood of some physical injury when a thirteen-year-old girl has sexual intercourse with a man nearly three times her age, the medical literature cited by the Maine Supreme Court substantiating that view completes the support.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize in so deciding that we have bypassed a number of troubling and complex issues that would need to be addressed before statutory rape at its most categorical level--i.e., regardless of the conduct charged--could be classified as a crime of violence for federal sentencing purposes.  Perhaps foremost among them is the standard age below which sexual intercourse typically may be considered to pose a \"serious potential risk of physical injury\" for a minor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Indeed, even determining what is meant by \"physical injury\" is a task fraught with complexity, as evidenced by the contrasting views of the Seventh Circuit judges in Shannon, 110 F.3d at 388-90.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These are issues that we believe courts, and particularly appeals courts, have neither the expertise nor the authority to resolve in the first instance,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> and that, in light of the growing number of cases in this area, should be handled expeditiously by the Sentencing Commission and Congress.  Accord Shannon, 110 F.3d at 389.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Meader argues that, in the meantime, we should invoke the rule of lenity to exclude his conviction from predicate offense status.  It is unnecessary to do so.  Whatever the dividing line between sexual offenses that constitute crimes of violence and those that do not, we are confident that the circumstances here fall well within the \"crime of violence\" category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore hold that, because defendant's conviction under Maine's statutory rape law involved conduct that created a \"serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" that offense qualifies as a crime of violence under the federal sentencing guidelines.  Meader thus having two such convictions, he properly was sentenced as a career offender.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The four questions proposed by Meader on the issue of domestic violence were as follows:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">1</a>\n        <p> Have you been involved in a domestic relationship in which physical force or abuse was involved?</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Has a relative of yours, or a close friend been involved in a domestic relationship in which physical force was used, or was claimed to have been used?</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Have you been involved in a domestic relationship in which the threat of physical force or abuse was involved?</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Has a relative of yours, or a close friend been involved in a domestic relationship in which the threat of physical force or abuse was used, or claimed to have been used?</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">2</a>\n        <p> On this point, the court wrote, in substantial part:</p>\n        <p>First, I am crediting the account of Mr. Decato--the defendant's employee, witness and boyfriend of his daughter--as to what the young man said to Mr. Decato....

Third, to pursue from her son things that the juror may or may not have said to him would be embarking on a fishing expedition contrary to the admonitions of the appellate courts to keep the jury process and the jurors themselves free of unnecessary intrusions.

Here, for example, where the statute of conviction covers a wide range of sexual crimes--from an adult's violent rape of a child to the consensual sexual intercourse of two teenagers--it was permissible under Taylor for the district court to review the charging papers and jury instructions to determine whether the jury in deciding to convict \"necessarily had to find\" force, see Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. at 2160, which would bring the conviction directly within the list of qualifying crimes contained in the Application Note.

See generally Taylor, 495 U.S. at 587, 110 S.Ct. at 2152 (enhancement provision in ACCA focused on \"those who commit a large number of fairly serious crimes as their means of livelihood\").  First, the language of the \"otherwise\" clause is broadly written, presumably to ensure capture of any crime posing a serious risk of physical injury.  Second, a criminal history that satisfies the career offender requirements by means of any crime serious enough to possibly cause injury to a person is not, in our view, inconsistent with the objective of the guideline to punish more heavily those who commit serious crimes and also have a significant criminal history</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> If statutory rape is to be classified generically as a crime of violence for purposes of the federal sentencing guidelines, the actionable age should be the same regardless of the state in which the crime occurred.  Yet, in a recent decision on whether to classify statutory rape as a crime of violence, the Seventh Circuit, sitting en banc, reported that states vary widely in setting the age above which sex with a minor is not made felonious, in the absence of aggravating circumstances.  See United States v. Shannon, 110 F.3d 382, 386 (7th Cir.1997) (en banc ).  In Illinois, for example, the age is seventeen;  in Wisconsin, it is sixteen;  in Pennsylvania, it is thirteen.

It should be noted that the first two cases involved the definition of \"crime of violence\" contained in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 16, focusing on the risk of physical force rather than physical injury.  The third case, Bauer, is a brief per curiam that relied almost entirely on the Eighth Circuit's earlier decision in Rodriguez, 979 F.2d at 140, which was more circumscribed (question of first impression whether commission of lascivious acts with a child, in the manner Rodriguez admits he committed the crime, qualifies as crime of violence)</p>\n        <p>Other courts, as noted earlier, have referred to the defendant's specific conduct and/or focused on the minor's age in reaching their conclusions.  See, e.g., United States v. Shannon, 110 F.3d 382, 389 (7th Cir.1997) (en banc ) (sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old is a crime of violence;  statute criminalized sexual contact or intercourse with child under 16);  United States v. Taylor, 98 F.3d 768, 773-74 (3d Cir.1996) (holding that indecent exposure was crime of violence based on facts alleged in indictment showing that victim was \"forced onto a bed and restrained while [defendant] commit[ted] a sexual act upon her\");  Wood, 52 F.3d at 275 (sexual contact with a four-year-old always poses serious risk of violence).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> In Shannon, the en banc Seventh Circuit, in reversing the panel's 2-1 ruling that the district court had erred in enhancing the defendant's sentence based on a previous conviction for sexual assault, recognized the difficulty of the issue and observed \"[w]e cannot be certain that we have gotten it right.\"  110 F.3d at 389.   The panel majority had emphasized the fact that the prior crime involved intercourse between two teenagers, the 17-year-old defendant and a 13-year-old girl, and stated that such conduct between two minors cannot automatically be deemed violent.

He essentially raises two claims on appeal, one involving possible juror bias and the other concerning his sentencing as a career criminal based on prior convictions for unlawful sexual contact and intercourse with a minor.  After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of the crime are largely irrelevant to the issues we face on appeal, and we therefore do not recite them in any detail.  It suffices to say that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the jury could have found that appellant abducted the mother of his young son at gunpoint from her parents' home, took her to the house they had shared, forced her to ingest cocaine and sleeping pills, and assaulted her sexually.  He eventually released her, and surrendered to authorities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury returned its guilty verdicts on March 27, 1996.  On April 19, defense counsel advised the court that he had received information about a juror that suggested that she possibly was biased.  A defense witness, Decato, had spoken with the juror's son, who reported that his mother had a history of abusive relationships and consequently was \"dead set against\" domestic abusers.  The son also told Decato that once his mother made up her mind she would not change it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial, Meader had submitted six proposed voir dire questions, four of which pertained to domestic abuse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>  The court reframed them into a single question:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>There may be evidence in this case concerning a domestic relationship in which physical force or abuse was involved or threatened.  Does any member of the panel have personal views or personal experiences that would prevent you from deciding this type of case fairly and impartially?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No juror responded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a conference with counsel following revelation of Decato's conversation, the district court identified two issues:  did the juror prejudge the case, and did she answer the voir dire question falsely?   Attempting to adhere to First Circuit authority strongly disfavoring direct contact with jurors, see United States v. Kepreos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450719\"><a href=\"/opinion/450719/united-states-v-constantine-t-kepreos/\"><span class=\"volume\">759</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">961</span></a></span>, 967 (1st Cir.1985), the court determined to hear testimony first from Decato, then from the juror's son, and, only if questions remained, from the juror.  Further reflection by both court and counsel following Decato's testimony and a review of the voir dire transcript led, however, to a decision to hear directly from the juror rather than her son.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The juror, Sandra Petersen, was questioned by the court in an informal session.  Both counsel were present and had submitted proposed questions, but they were asked to remain at the periphery of the proceeding \"to maintain a certain level of informality.\"   Juror Petersen acknowledged that she had been emotionally and verbally abused by an ex-husband, and that her son had been physically abused by the same man.  She further acknowledged that she does not like abusers, but emphatically rejected her son's suggestion to Decato that she had her mind made up about the case before its conclusion.  She responded to the court's question on that point as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>What?  No way.  No way.  He--he must have fabricated that because no way.  No, I--in fact, I told him that it would take awhile for me to--to come to the decision because it's a man's life is what I said.  And that's the way I feel about any case.  You know, I'm--I've got a man's life here in my hands.  There's no way I--no.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to her son's comment that \"my mother doesn't change her mind once it's set,\" she explained that that was the way she handled him--\"if I tell him this is it, that's all\"--and that she viewed his statement as an attempt \"to pump himself up, make himself look big\" because his mother was a juror for the trial.  Asked if her views had any impact on the trial, the juror replied:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>I retarded everyone else in the deliberation because I had a life in my hand and I did not know, you know, if I should go along with everybody else.  Everyone else was going towards guilty.  I was not.  Because I waited until, you know, I heard more about it and more evidence and, you know, we deliberated before I finally said yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the court asked if her experiences with her ex-husband affected her attitude toward the trial, she answered:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>It did in a way because I had to really think out the case and say, you know, is this--you know, is there abuse here or is it that this man has a--a mental problem ... I know a little bit about the psychic mind and how it works.  And sometimes when you're under an awful lot of stress you will do things on the spur of the moment.  But the other jurors made me see that this was premeditated, he thought it out before he--he actually did the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, when asked specifically whether her experiences affected her fairness or impartiality, the juror replied:  \"I think I was very fair because I thought it all out....  I wouldn't make a judgment on someone unless I really thought something out.  And I wouldn't let my own personal feelings interfere in any way.\"   She repeated that sentiment when asked whether her personal views made her more or less sympathetic to either the government or the defense:  \"I went by what was on the table....  I put my own feelings aside.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this inquiry, the court tentatively concluded that neither predisposition nor outside factors influenced the jury's verdict, but also asked for briefs from counsel.  The court rejected defense counsel's request that the court also question the juror's son, noting the First Circuit's reluctance to probe into the jury process unless absolutely necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 14, 1996, three weeks after the court's exchange with the juror, Meader moved for a mistrial.  He claimed both that the court should have used his proposed voir dire questions, instead of the court's modification, and that additional investigation into juror bias was necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the motion in a thoughtful ten-page order, and we here provide only a summary of its contents.  First, the court found no suggestion of prejudice, observing that the juror's answers--which the court found \"logical and believable\"--\"reveal that, if anything, she gave this defendant the benefit of the doubt.\"   On Meader's claim that his voir dire questions should have been asked, the court noted that no objection was raised to the questions actually posed and no requests for additional questions were made at the time of the voir dire.   The claim therefore was waived.  Responding to Meader's attack on the adequacy of the investigation into bias, the court noted the need to avoid undue intrusion into jurors' lives, and stated that testimony from the juror's son was unnecessary because the court had credited Decato's testimony about what the son told him, even though Decato had reason to testify so as to make a mistrial more likely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court sentenced Meader to 120 months in prison on Count One (felon-in-possession), to be served concurrently with a 360-month term on Count Two (distribution of cocaine).  A 60-month consecutive term, as required by statute, would follow on Count Three (use of firearm in drug trafficking crime).  The penalties reflected increases for various specific characteristics of the offenses, including the abduction of the victim, commission of criminal sexual abuse, and use of force and threats of death.  The penalty also reflected Meader's status as a career offender, based on his having two prior convictions for drug or violent crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Meader challenges the district court's handling of the voir dire and the allegations of juror bias, both relating to the domestic abuse issue.  He also claims that his prior convictions for statutory rape and unlawful sexual contact were not crimes of violence and thus should not have been used to classify him as a career offender.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>II. Domestic Abuse:  Voir Dire and Juror Bias</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Voir Dire.  We need not dwell on the district court's failure to ask verbatim Meader's proposed voir dire questions.  The court had no obligation to ask the questions in the specific language proposed, see United States v. Victoria-Peguero, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552332\"><a href=\"/opinion/552332/united-states-v-pedro-r-victoria-peguero-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir.1990), and counsel's acquiescence in the court's reframed question means that any objection to that formulation was not preserved for appeal.  See United States v. Walsh, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196529\"><a href=\"/opinion/196529/united-states-v-walsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1996) (\"[T]he usual rule is that an objection must be made known at the time that the court is making its decision to act....\").  Because the district court's inquiry--asking whether jurors could impartially judge a case involving domestic violence--directly focused on the critical concern of bias, we are persuaded beyond any doubt that no plain error occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In so concluding, we offer no view of the substance of Meader's complaint.  He contends that the court's voir dire question, allowing jurors who were exposed to domestic violence to reveal their experiences only if they felt such exposure would impact their jury service, deprived him of the ability to use his challenges effectively.  Although this position has some force, we decline to consider whether, in other circumstances, the failure to pose more discerning questions would be reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Juror Bias.  Meader also challenges the district court's approach and conclusion with respect to the possible bias of one juror.  He particularly complains about the court's failure to hear testimony from the juror's son and its prohibiting the defendant from either directly contacting the son or sending an investigator to interview him.  Meader asserts that this limitation on the bias inquiry prevented him from effectively challenging the juror's \"self-serving statements ... that she could and did put her feelings about domestic abuse aside in deciding this case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our caselaw holds that a district court is obliged to investigate plausible allegations of improper influence on a jury verdict, see, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196529\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Walsh,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196529/united-states-v-walsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">6-7</span></a></span>;  United States v. Hunnewell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533778\"><a href=\"/opinion/533778/united-states-v-dale-scott-hunnewell/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></a></span>, 961 (1st Cir.1989), but that the court has \"broad discretion to determine the type of investigation which must be mounted,\" United States v. Boylan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538369\"><a href=\"/opinion/538369/united-states-v-peter-boylan-united-states-of-america-v-john-e-carey/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 258 (1st Cir.1990);  see also <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196529\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Walsh,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196529/united-states-v-walsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>. In this case, the court's process was a textbook model of conscientiousness, and so far from an abuse of discretion that it is difficult to take Meader's complaint seriously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court promptly conferred with counsel about how to proceed when alerted to the possible juror taint, it ordered a transcript of the jury selection process so that it could accurately review the new information in light of what previously had occurred, it heard testimony from the witness who had brought the juror's possible bias to the defendant's attention, and it discussed with the parties how best to proceed in keeping with both the First Circuit's admonition against unnecessary juror contact and the need to ferret out the juror's true attitudes.  Indeed, the court overcame its reluctance to question the juror directly in deference to defendant's preference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The process of questioning the juror also was marked by commendable attention to the various interests at stake.  So that the juror would not be unduly alarmed or prepare ahead for questioning on the bias issue, she was asked to appear in court by means of a regular jury summons.  The attorneys were given the opportunity to submit questions to the court, but were kept on the sidelines during the actual questioning to contain the formality of the proceeding.  After completing the preliminary questions, the court excused the juror and consulted with counsel about possible additional areas of inquiry.  Its rejection of defendant's request to question the son as well, or to allow him to be questioned by investigators, was carefully considered and supportable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a>  Its substantial written opinion fully explained the basis of its conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is the court's finding that the juror was not prejudicially biased assailable.  The dialogue between the court and the juror recounted above reveals that the juror understood her obligation to keep her own subjective, though related, feelings outside of the deliberation process, and that, as the court observed, she gave the defendant \"the benefit of the doubt.\"   Assessment of the juror's credibility as she responded to the questioning is uniquely the domain of the district court, and, to borrow the government's language, her \"clear, responsive, and forthright responses provided ample reason to credit her assertions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we find no basis connected to the court's handling of the domestic abuse issue upon which to disturb the jury's verdicts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Career Offender Status</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meader claims that the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1, which provides for enhanced sentences if a defendant's criminal history satisfies three criteria:  (1) he was at least 18 years old at the time he committed the offense for which he is being sentenced;  (2) that offense is a felony that either constituted a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense;  and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions for either crimes of violence or crimes involving controlled substances.  Meader concedes most of these requirements, including one of the two necessary \"predicate offenses.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a>  The only issue in dispute is whether his criminal history includes a second such offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court based its finding of career offender status on two 1988 Maine convictions for statutory rape and unlawful sexual contact with a child under the age of fourteen, finding that they qualified as \"crimes of violence\" within the meaning of the guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Meader contends that neither was properly counted.  The issue is one of law, and our review is therefore de novo.  United States v. Winter, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195327\"><a href=\"/opinion/195327/united-states-v-winter/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A \"crime of violence\" under the guidelines is any state or federal offense punishable by a year or more in prison that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (ii) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(1).  Application note 2 to the provision elaborates on the meaning of \"crime of violence\" by listing additional crimes that fall within its scope, including murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, and forcible sex offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because neither of the two Maine sexual offenses includes as an element the use or threat of physical force,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> it is undisputed that in order to qualify as \"crimes of violence\" they must fall under the \"otherwise\" clause of &#167; 4B1.2, and therefore be offenses that present \"a serious potential risk of physical injury.\"   The district court, noting that the requisite risk is of any physical injury, found that \"there is a strong likelihood of some physical injury, however minor the injury might be in the range of possible physical injuries that can happen to a human body in sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old female.\"   The court drew support for its conclusion from a Maine Supreme Court case, State v. Rundlett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1956592\"><a href=\"/opinion/1956592/state-v-rundlett/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span> </a></span>(1978), that linked passage of the state's statutory rape provision to a concern about physical injury to young girls, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1956592\"><a href=\"/opinion/1956592/state-v-rundlett/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 819, </a></span>and that cited medical literature on injuries caused to young adolescent females by sexual intercourse with adult males.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Thus, combining its own perceptions with this precedent and supporting material, the district court held that the Maine convictions triggered career offender status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meader takes issue with this finding on multiple fronts.  His primary argument is that the district court failed to follow the well established \"categorical\" approach for deciding the \"crime of violence\" issue, see, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195327\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Winter,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195327/united-states-v-winter/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, and that, if it had, its conclusion would have been different.  He emphasizes that the rape statute embraces a wide variety of consensual acts, including those between two individuals who are both under the age of fourteen, and imposes liability without culpability.  Consequently, he asserts, many, if not most, circumstances of statutory rape would not involve a likelihood of the sort of accompanying violence that was targeted by the career offender guideline.  Therefore, viewed from a categorical perspective, he maintains that statutory rape under Maine law cannot be classified as a crime of violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court's inquiry is not as confined as Meader posits it to be.  Meader is correct that the standard approach for determining whether a particular crime fits within the \"crime of violence\" rubric is a generic one, in which inquiry is restricted to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, without regard to the particular facts underlying them, see Taylor v.

This is what the district court did.  Using only the facts contained in the indictment, the court identified the issue before it as \"whether sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old female or sexual touching of a 13-year-old female by a 36-year-old male ... 'by its nature presented a serious potential risk of physical injury' to the 13-year-old female.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This careful articulation of the question provides the target for Meader's second-tier assault on the court's methodology.  He argues that, assuming the court acted properly in referring at all to the indictment, it was improper to rely on factors as specific as the victim's gender and the age disparity between the two individuals.  He points out that the statute is gender neutral, and that the specific age difference was irrelevant to the conviction (beyond the three-year gap required by the sexual contact offense).  Focusing too narrowly, Meader contends, will inject disparity back into the sentencing procedure, undermining the rationale of consistency that supports the categorical approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Meader's view, therefore, once scrutiny of the charging papers revealed no allegation of force, a categorical analysis required the conclusion that this conviction was not a violent crime within the meaning of the Guidelines.  He emphasizes that this result is consistent with the intent of the Sentencing Commission, which listed sexual offenses as crimes of violence only when they were \"forcible.\"   See supra at 12.   Indeed, he maintains that using a conviction for underage sexual relations without that requirement \"runs contrary to the stated purpose of the act, to focus law enforcement efforts on 'those who commit a large number of fairly serious crimes as their means of livelihood.' \"   Appellant's Brief at 45 (citing <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Taylor,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">587</span></a></span>, 110 S.Ct. at 2152).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not accept the proposition that the guidelines permit no more refined scrutiny than an examination of whether the charging documents (or jury instructions) include an explicit allegation of force.  The question for the sentencing court here was whether the defendant's conduct, by its nature, posed a serious risk of physical injury.  Although the use of force in virtually every instance could be expected to create a serious risk of injury, it is not the only way in which the guideline standard could be met.  The age of the girl and the chronological gap between her and the defendant were crucial facts that framed the nature of the crime, and were relevant to the question of injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other circuits have treated the issue in similar fashion, linking their determinations that sexual contact with a minor is a crime of violence to the specific age of the victim.

In a concurrence, Judge Manion, joined by Judge Kanne, stated his view that \"the risk of physical injury referred to in the Guideline must be confined to the act of intercourse, not the possible consequences that could develop, such as pregnancy or disease.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739088\"><a href=\"/opinion/739088/united-states-v-defabian-c-shannon/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 390</a></span></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> Some courts deciding that sexual offenses involving minors should be classified as crimes of violence have framed their holdings broadly, however, notwithstanding the lack of supporting data.  See, e.g., United States v.

It should be noted that the first two cases involved the definition of \"crime of violence\" contained in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 16, focusing on the risk of physical force rather than physical injury.

The panel majority had emphasized the fact that the prior crime involved intercourse between two teenagers, the 17-year-old defendant and a 13-year-old girl, and stated that such conduct between two minors cannot automatically be deemed violent.
