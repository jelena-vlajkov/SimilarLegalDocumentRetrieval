Gale, United  States Attorney, Margaret  E. Curran\n                                                               \nand  Lawrence D.  Gaynor, Assistant  United States  Attorneys, on\n                      \nbrief for appellee.\n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n          Per Curiam.  Petitioner  challenges the denial of a\n                    \n\nmotion under 28 U.S.C.   2255 to vacate, set aside or correct\n\nhis  sentence.1     He   alleges  that  the   district  court\n\nerroneously enhanced his  sentence two levels  for possession\n\nof a firearm during the offense.  He also alleges ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel in the failure to object on this ground\n\nand to take a  direct appeal from  the sentence imposed.   We\n\naffirm the district court's disposition.  \n\n          Petitioner  pleaded guilty to  a cluster of charges\n\nstemming  from his  involvement  in a  large scale  marijuana\n\ndistribution  operation.2    In  return  for  his  plea,  the\n\ngovernment  agreed  to  recommend  dismissal of  two  of  the\n\ncharges,3 and  imposition of a sentence at the low end of the\n\n                    \n\n1.  Due to  a tangled  procedural history, summarized  in the\ndistrict court's decision of February 3, 1993, this appeal is\ntaken from  an order  denying petitioner's motion  for relief\nfrom judgment.  That  motion, in turn, sought reconsideration\nof the court's May 12, 1992 order denying petitioner's motion\nunder 28 U.S.C.   2255.  \n\n2.  The indictment  charged a conspiracy among  defendant and\nsix  others   to  distribute  and  possess   with  intent  to\ndistribute 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation\nof 21 U.S.C.    846.  In  addition to that  charge, defendant\npleaded guilty  to the  following charges in  the indictment:\npossession with  intent to  distribute the same  quantity, 21\nU.S.C.     841(a)(1),  841(b)(1)(4);  using a  communications\nfacility  for  the  commission  of a  narcotics  offense,  21\nU.S.C.   843(b);  maintaining  a  place for  the  purpose  of\ndistributing marijuana, 21 U.S.C.   856.  \n\n3.  The charges dismissed by agreement were:  possession of a\nfirearm  during and in relation to  a drug trafficking crime,\n18  U.S.C.    924(c),  and  operating  a continuing  criminal\nenterprise, 21 U.S.C.   848.\n\n                             -2-\n\nguideline  offense  level  chosen by  the  court.   The  plea\n\nagreement recited the parties' understanding that defendant's\n\nCriminal  History Category  was  I, and  that the  applicable\n\nguideline  offense  level  would  be  either  34,  35  or 36,\n\ndepending on the district court's ruling.   \n\n          The  presentence  report calculated  the applicable\n\noffense level at  36 as follows:  (1)  the base offense level\n\nwas 32; (2)  a two  level increase was  assessed pursuant  to\n\nU.S.S.G.    2D1.1(b)(1) for  possessing a firearm  during the\n\noffense;  (3)  a  four  level  increase  was  assessed  under\n\nU.S.S.G.    3B1.1  for  being an  organizer  or leader  of  a\n\ncriminal activity  that involved  five or more  participants;\n\nand  (4)  petitioner  was  awarded a  two-level  decrease  in\n\noffense level for acceptance  of responsibility pursuant to  \n\n3E1.1.\n\n          Petitioner   objected  only   to  the   four  level\n\nenhancement   for  being   an  organizer   or  leader.     He\n\nsuccessfully renewed this contention as his sole objection at\n\nthe sentencing hearing.   He  testified at  length about  his\n\nrole in  the conspiracy, the government  presented a rebuttal\n\nwitness on point,  and there were vigorous  arguments by both\n\nsides.    The   district  court   agreed  that   petitioner's\n\ninvolvement qualified only for  a two level enhancement under\n\n  3B1.1(c),  not a four  level enhancement.   At petitioner's\n\nurging,  the court  ruled that  the proper  guideline offense\n\n                             -3-\n\nlevel  was  34.4   Accepting  the plea  agreement,  the court\n\nsentenced petitioner to 151 months, the low end of the lowest\n\nguideline  offense level  conceded  to be  applicable by  the\n\nparties.\n\n          Petitioner did  not take  a timely appeal  from the\n\nsentence.  Instead, he  filed a   2255 motion one  year later\n\nchallenging  the sentence on the  ground that the court erred\n\nin  imposing  the  two  level increase  for  possession  of a\n\nfirearm.   He argued  that there  was  an insufficient  nexus\n\nbetween  the  loaded  firearm  found  in  his  home  and  the\n\nnarcotics offenses to which  he pleaded guilty.  In  reply to\n\nthe government's contention that this claim of error had been\n\n                    \n\n4.  The  following exchange between  petitioner's counsel and\nthe court occurred in petitioner's presence at the hearing:\n\n          Counsel:   [A]ll we  are asking  you to  do is\n                                                        \n     sentence this defendant at the low end of level 34.\n                                                        \n     He has no quarrel with  that at all.  He agrees  he\n                                                        \n     should be sentenced at 34.\n                               \n\n          The Court:  You want me to sentence him to 151\n     months?  That's what it is 151 to 188 months.\n\n          Counsel:  That's what I want, your Honor, yes.\n\nSentencing Hearing of  March 1,  1991, Tr. at  79, ll.  10-17\n(emphasis added). \n\n     Petitioner  had an opportunity  to directly  address the\ncourt  after  this  exchange,  as  well  as  after the  court\nindicated  its  likely  ruling.    Petitioner  indicated   no\nobjection.  Tr. at 86-23 to 90-14.\n\n                             -4-\n\nforfeited by a double procedural  default, petitioner claimed\n\nineffective assistance by his counsel.5\n\n          We agree with the district court's conclusions.  On\n\nappeal,  the  fact-finder's  determination   that  petitioner\n\nreceived effective  assistance of counsel at sentencing, \"may\n\nbe overturned  only  for  clear  error.\"   Isabel  v.  United\n                                                             \n\nStates, 980 F.2d 60, 64 (1st Cir. 1992).  \"[P]etitioner bears\n      \n\na  very heavy  burden  on an  ineffective assistance  claim.\"\n\nLema  v. United States,  987 F.2d 48  (1st Cir.  1993).  \"The\n                      \n\ncourt must  not only find that  defense counsel's performance\n\nwas deficient, but that it was so prejudicial as to undermine\n\nconfidence in  the outcome.\"   Strickland v.  Washington, 466\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 668,  689 (1984).    And petitioner  must \"overcome  the\n\npresumption that,  under  the circumstances,  the  challenged\n\naction   `might  be   considered   sound  trial   strategy.'\"\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 689 (citation omitted).     \n          \n\n          Applying  these  standards,  petitioner's  argument\n\nfalls far short of  the \"clear error\" threshold.   Petitioner\n\noffered no cogent argument  or evidence to overcome  the very\n\n                    \n\n5.  These  were  the  only  issues  presented  below  and  in\npetitioner's  main  brief.    In his  reply  brief,  however,\npetitioner seems  to  also argue  error  in the  point  level\nincrease assigned by the district court under   3B1.1(c), the\nvery matter upon which petitioner prevailed at the sentencing\nhearing.   Reply Br. at 6,  7.  Aside from  the reply brief's\napparent  misstatement of the  record (the  ultimate increase\nwas two levels, not four as  claimed in the brief), we do not\nconsider  alleged  errors  assigned  for the  first  time  on\nappeal. \n\n                             -5-\n\nstrong presumption  that counsel's failure to  object on this\n\nground was a  deliberate strategic decision.  The  loaded gun\n\nhad been found in petitioner's home along with a large amount\n\nof cash  ($266,230.00), drug  paraphernalia,  and a  suitcase\n\nwith marijuana  residue.  There was  substantial testimony at\n\nthe  hearing,  including  petitioner's  own  testimony,  that\n\npetitioner's home had  served as a routine base of operations\n\nfor  the conspiracy.  Even  after the base  of operations was\n\nmoved elsewhere, the presentence report and  testimony showed\n\nthat  petitioner's  home  continued   to  be  used  for  drug\n\ndistribution activities,  and  the cash  represented  profits\n\nfrom the illegal scheme.6  \n\n          In similar cases we have held that the base offense\n\nlevel  should be  increased by  two levels  under U.S.S.G.   \n\n2D1.1(b)(1) unless it is  \"clearly improbable that the weapon\n\nand  the   offense  were   connected.\"    United   States  v.\n                                                         \n\nCorcimiglia, 967 F.2d 724, 726 (1st Cir. 1992); United States\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n6.  In his  reply brief petitioner  now asserts there  was no\nevidence to connect  his home,  and the money  found, to  the\nillegal  drug  activities.    These   assertions  are  flatly\ncontradicted by his own  testimony at the hearing as  well as\nthat  of the  government's  witness.   Sentencing Hearing  of\nMarch 1, 1991 at 12-20 to 13-9; 13-19 to 14-6;  21, ll. 9-12;\n45 to 46; 52; 55; 59; 68-69; see also,  Presentence Report at\n                                     \n10.   We also  reject as  meritless petitioner's  reply brief\nargument  that  dismissal  of  the  charge  against  him  for\npossession of a weapon in violation of 18 U.S.C.   924(c) was\ninconsistent with  enhancement of his sentence under U.S.S.G.\n   2D1.1(b)(1).  It is well settled that conduct not formally\ncharged may  enter into the decision  on sentencing guideline\nrange. See generally United States v. Jackson, 1993 U.S. App.\n                                             \nLEXIS 22019, at *8 (1st Cir. Aug. 1, 1993) (citing cases).  \n\n                             -6-\n\nv.  McDowell,  918 F.2d  1004, 1011  (1st Cir.  1990) (citing\n            \n\ncases).   Given  the admission  that illegal  drug activities\n\noccurred in the very  place where the gun was  found, counsel\n\ncould not have reasonably expected to succeed on an  argument\n\nthat  it was \"improbable\" that  the gun was  connected to the\n\nillegal  activity.   The  failure to  object  on that  basis,\n\nespecially  in light  of the  court's express  inclination to\n\nsentence petitioner in  accordance with  the plea  agreement,\n\nwas  undoubtedly  deliberate, and,  as  the  court held,  not\n\nprejudicial to petitioner.\n\n          As  to counsel's  failure to  take a  direct appeal\n\nfrom  the  sentence,  we  have held  that  where  a  criminal\n\ndefendant  loses  his  right   to  a  direct  appeal  through\n\ndereliction  of his counsel, he  is entitled to  a new appeal\n\nwithout first showing a meritorious appellate issue.  Bonneau\n                                                             \n\nv.  United States, 961 F.2d 17 (1st Cir. 1992); United States\n                                                             \n\nv.

However,  a defendant  who\n      \n\nvoluntarily  forfeits  his right  to a  direct appeal  is not\n\nentitled to  assign error  for the first  time on  collateral\n\nreview without showing both cause  for the default and actual\n\nprejudice resulting  from the assigned error.   United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Frady, 456 U.S.  152 (1982); see also Tajeddini,  945 F.2d\n                                                  \n\nat 468 (remanding case to district court to determine whether\n\npetitioner had voluntarily foregone his right to appeal).    \n\n                             -7-\n\n            Petitioner's excuse for failing to  take a direct\n\nappeal  is that  he didn't know  he had the  right to appeal.\n\nFirst  he  blames  his  lack of  knowledge  on  his  counsel,\n\nclaiming  that counsel failed to  advise him of  his right to\n\nappeal.   However, the  letter he  offered from  his attorney\n\ndoes  not support this claim.7   Second, petitioner claims he\n\nwas in \"shock\" and  under the influence of medication  at the\n\ntime of sentencing.  For this reason,  petitioner alleges, he\n\ncould  not understand the  judge's plain  statement informing\n\npetitioner of his right to appeal the sentence.  Petitioner's\n\n\"shock\" claim, however, is belied by his own lengthy, concise\n\nand  responsive testimony  at the  hearing.   And the  record\n\nshows  no mention  of petitioner's use  of medication  at the\n\ntime of sentencing.           While  the  district court  did\n\nnot  expressly  rule  on  the voluntariness  of  petitioner's\n\nfailure to  appeal, the  record before us  is plain.   As the\n\nletter from his counsel affirms,  there was no incentive  for\n\n                    \n\n7.  The letter from petitioner's attorney dated July 8, 1991,\ndoes not state that petitioner was uninformed.  At best it is\nequivocal on that point  \n\n          I  did not file a Notice of Appeal since it is\n     my  recollection that it would  not be in your best\n     interest to raise  an issue (1) that  you could not\n     win;  and (2)  that might  open the  door to  a re-\n     calculation of the entire sentence.  \n\n          If,  however,  your recollection  differs, you\n     could file a 2255 alleging ineffective assistance. \n\nPetitioner's Traverse to Government's Objection, Exhibit A.\n\n                             -8-\n\npetitioner to take  a direct appeal  because he had  obtained\n\nall  the relief he sought  at the sentencing  hearing.  Aside\n\nfrom  his  transparently thin  claim  of  lack of  knowledge,\n\npetitioner offered no evidence below to rebut the presumption\n\nof a  voluntary waiver.   He asserts  no other cause  for his\n\nprocedural default, nor any prejudice from the alleged error.\n\n          Accordingly, we affirm the judgment below.    \n                                \n\n                             -9-\n",

The district court agreed that petitioner's involvement qualified only for a two level enhancement under &#167; 3B1.1(c), not a four level enhancement.  At petitioner's urging, the court ruled that the proper guideline offense level was 34.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Accepting the plea agreement, the court sentenced petitioner to 151 months, the low end of the lowest guideline offense level conceded to be applicable by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner did not take a timely appeal from the sentence.  Instead, he filed a &#167; 2255 motion one year later challenging the sentence on the ground that the court erred in imposing the two level increase for possession of a firearm.  He argued that there was an insufficient nexus between the loaded firearm found in his home and the narcotics offenses to which he pleaded guilty.  In reply to the government's contention that this claim of error had been forfeited by a double procedural default, petitioner claimed ineffective assistance by his counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court's conclusions.  On appeal, the fact-finder's determination that petitioner received effective assistance of counsel at sentencing, \"may be overturned only for clear error.\"   Isabel v. United States, 980 F.2d 60, 64 (1st Cir. 1992).  \"[P]etitioner bears a very heavy burden on an ineffective assistance claim.\"   Lema v. United States, 987 F.2d 48 (1st Cir. 1993).  \"The court must not only find that defense counsel's performance was deficient, but that it was so prejudicial as to undermine confidence in the outcome.\"   Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 689 (1984).  And petitioner must \"overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action 'might be considered sound trial strategy.' \"   Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these standards, petitioner's argument falls far short of the \"clear error\" threshold.  Petitioner offered no cogent argument or evidence to overcome the very strong presumption that counsel's failure to object on this ground was a deliberate strategic decision.  The loaded gun had been found in petitioner's home along with a large amount of cash ($266,230.00), drug paraphernalia, and a suitcase with marijuana residue.  There was substantial testimony at the hearing, including petitioner's own testimony, that petitioner's home had served as a routine base of operations for the conspiracy.  Even after the base of operations was moved elsewhere, the presentence report and testimony showed that petitioner's home continued to be used for drug distribution activities, and the cash represented profits from the illegal scheme.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In similar cases we have held that the base offense level should be increased by two levels under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1) unless it is \"clearly improbable that the weapon and the offense were connected.\"   United States v. Corcimiglia, 967 F.2d 724, 726 (1st Cir. 1992);  United States v. McDowell, 918 F.2d 1004, 1011 (1st Cir. 1990) (citing cases).  Given the admission that illegal drug activities occurred in the very place where the gun was found, counsel could not have reasonably expected to succeed on an argument that it was \"improbable\" that the gun was connected to the illegal activity.  The failure to object on that basis, especially in light of the court's express inclination to sentence petitioner in accordance with the plea agreement, was undoubtedly deliberate, and, as the court held, not prejudicial to petitioner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to counsel's failure to take a direct appeal from the sentence, we have held that where a criminal defendant loses his right to a direct appeal through dereliction of his counsel, he is entitled to a new appeal without first showing a meritorious appellate issue.

However, a defendant who voluntarily forfeits his right to a direct appeal is not entitled to assign error for the first time on collateral review without showing both cause for the default and actual prejudice resulting from the assigned error.   United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152 (1982);   see also Tajeddini, 945 F.2d at 468 (remanding case to district court to determine whether petitioner had voluntarily foregone his right to appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's excuse for failing to take a direct appeal is that he didn't know he had the right to appeal.

However, the letter he offered from his attorney does not support this claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Second, petitioner claims he was in \"shock\" and under the influence of medication at the time of sentencing.  For this reason, petitioner alleges, he could not understand the judge's plain statement informing petitioner of his right to appeal the sentence.  Petitioner's \"shock\" claim, however, is belied by his own lengthy, concise and responsive testimony at the hearing.

We also reject as meritless petitioner's reply brief argument that dismissal of the charge against him for possession of a weapon in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) was inconsistent with enhancement of his sentence under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1).

In addition to that charge, defendant pleaded guilty to the following charges in the indictment:  possession with intent to distribute the same quantity, 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(4);  using a communications facility for the commission of a narcotics offense, 21 U.S.C.s 843(b);  maintaining a place for the purpose of distributing marijuana, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 856</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The charges dismissed by agreement were:  possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), and operating a continuing criminal enterprise, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 848</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The following exchange between petitioner's counsel and the court occurred in petitioner's presence at the hearing:</p>\n        <p>Counsel:  [A]ll we are asking you to do is sentence this defendant at the low end of level 34.  He has no quarrel with that at all.  He agrees he should be sentenced at 34.</p>\n        <p>The Court:  You want me to sentence him to 151 months?  That's what it is 151 to 188 months.</p>\n        <p>Counsel:  That's what I want, your Honor, yes.</p>\n        <p>Sentencing Hearing of March 1, 1991, Tr. at 79, ll. 10-17 (emphasis added).</p>\n        <p>Petitioner had an opportunity to directly address the court after this exchange, as well as after the court indicated its likely ruling.  Petitioner indicated no objection.  Tr. at 86-23 to 90-14.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> These were the only issues presented below and in petitioner's main brief.  In his reply brief, however, petitioner seems to also argue error in the point level increase assigned by the district court under &#167; 3B1.1(c), the very matter upon which petitioner prevailed at the sentencing hearing.  Reply Br. at 6, 7. Aside from the reply brief's apparent misstatement of the record (the ultimate increase was two levels, not four as claimed in the brief), we do not consider alleged errors assigned for the first time on appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In his reply brief petitioner now asserts there was no evidence to connect his home, and the money found, to the illegal drug activities.  These assertions are flatly contradicted by his own testimony at the hearing as well as that of the government's witness.  Sentencing Hearing of March 1, 1991 at 12-20 to 13-9;  13-19 to 14-6;  21, ll. 9-12;  45 to 46;  52;  55;  59;  68-69;  see also, Presentence Report at 10.  We also reject as meritless petitioner's reply brief argument that dismissal of the charge against him for possession of a weapon in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) was inconsistent with enhancement of his sentence under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1).  It is well settled that conduct not formally charged may enter into the decision on sentencing guideline range.  See generally United States v. Jackson, 1993 U.S. App.  LEXIS 22019, at (1st Cir.  Aug. 1, 1993) (citing cases)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The letter from petitioner's attorney dated July 8, 1991, does not state that petitioner was uninformed.  At best it is equivocal on that point</p>\n        <p>I did not file a Notice of Appeal since it is my recollection that it would not be in your best interest to raise an issue (1) that you could not win;  and (2) that might open the door to a re-calculation of the entire sentence.</p>\n        <p>If, however, your recollection differs, you could file a 2255 alleging ineffective assistance.</p>\n        <p>Petitioner's Traverse to Government's Objection, Exhibit A.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
