Petitioner Samuel Fuentes appeals from\r                                \n\nthe denial  of his  petition for habeas  corpus relief  filed\n\nunder 28  U.S.C.   2254.   He  claimed that officials  of the\n\nRhode  Island  Adult  Correctional  Institutions  (ACI)  were\n\nrequired to   reactivate  a moribund prisoner  blood donation\n\nprogram  during the years 1983  to 1988.   The district court\n\ndenied  the petition on the merits, finding that there was no\n\nneed for blood donations during this time period.\n\n          Until its repeal in 1988, R.I. Gen. Laws   42-56-25\n\nprovided as follows:\n\n               In addition to any time  allowed for\n          good behavior pursuant to  section 42-56-\n          24 any prisoner sentenced to imprisonment\n          for thirty (30) days of [sic] more in the\n          adult  correctional   institutions .  . .\n          shall be  entitled to have  deducted from\n          the  term or  terms of  sentence of  such\n          prisoner ten (10)  days for each  pint of\n          his or her blood donated by him or her to\n          any veterans' organization, civil defense\n          unit, hospital, the  armed forces of  the\n          United States,  or the  Red Cross  or any\n          fraternal  or religious  organizations or\n          for the purposes of  scientific research.\n          Each  prisoner shall  be limited  to four\n          (4) donations each year.\n\nPetitioner states that he began donating blood pursuant  to  \n\n42-56-25  in 1979 and received  a total deduction  of 90 days\n\nfrom  his  sentence.    He alleges  that  prison  authorities\n\ndiscontinued  the program  in  1983 even  though the  statute\n\nremained in effect until 1988.\n\n          Attached  to the    2254  petition is  a memorandum\n\ndated May 20, 1993 from  a deputy warden to petitioner.   The\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nmemorandum  appears  to have  been written  in response  to a\n\nrequest   by  petitioner   to  donate   blood.     It  denies\n\npetitioner's request,  stating that  there has been  no blood\n\ndonation program  since February 1983.  There  is no evidence\n\nthat petitioner asked,  at any other time, to give blood.  As\n\nrelief, petitioner  requested a credit  of 200  days for  the\n\nblood he would have donated from 1983 until 1988 -- about  33\n\ndays per year.\n\n          We need not reach  the merits of petitioner's claim\n\nbecause there is no evidence that he ever presented it to the\n\nRhode  Island courts.    Thus, it  appears  that he  has  not\n\nexhausted  state  remedies.   Principles  of  comity and  the\n\nrequirements of    2254(b)  generally provide that  the state\n\nshould have  the first  opportunity to  address this  kind of\n\nconstitutional  claim.  See Nadworny v.  Fair, 872 F.2d 1093,\r                                                         \n\n1096 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n          In this  context,  we note  that there  is a  state\n\nremedy available to petitioner.   Under R.I. Gen. Laws    10-\n\n9.1-1, petitioner may, at  any time, file an  application for\n\npost  conviction review  of the  alleged unlawfulness  of his\n\ncustody.     Further,     10-9.1-5  provides   that  indigent\n\napplicants  are  entitled  to  representation   by  a  public\n\ndefender.\n\n          We  therefore remand  the  matter to  the  district\r                                          \n\ncourt with  instructions  to  dismiss  the  petition  without\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nprejudice so that petitioner may exhaust state remedies.\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
