Defendant-appellant Robert L.

For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n\n          On November 28, 1989, a grand jury returned a three\n\ncount indictment  charging Huguenin with attempting  to evade\n\nhis income tax  obligations for 1984, 1985 and 1986.   See 26\n                                                          \n\nU.S.C.   7201.  Huguenin was convicted of all three counts on\n\nJune 15,  1990.   The district court  sentenced Huguenin,  on\n\nCount  I, to  forty-two months'  imprisonment  and fined  him\n\n$5,931.18.  On  Count II, the imposition of  the sentence was\n\nsuspended,  and   the  defendant  was  placed  on  supervised\n\nprobation  upon release from confinement for three years with\n\nthe condition that\n\n     defendant  is to file all past, present, and future\n     income tax  returns for  those years  where he  had\n     income &amp; pay tax that is due.  Defendant to provide\n     copies of tax returns to probation counselor.\n\nOn Count  III, the imposition  of the sentence  was suspended\n\nand the defendant  was placed on unsupervised probation to be\n\nserved  consecutively  to  the  three  years   of  supervised\n\nprobation  previously imposed  on  Count  II.    We  affirmed\n\nHuguenin's  conviction  in an  unpublished  opinion.   United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.  Robert L.  Huguenin, No. 90-1795,  1991 U.S.  App.\n                              \n\nLEXIS 32842 (1st Cir. Dec. 4, 1991) (per curiam).\n\n                             -2-\n\n          Appellant's  supervised probation  began on  August\n\n10, 1993.  On September  7, 1993, his probation officer filed\n\na  petition with  the  district  court  charging him  with  a\n\nfailure to \"file income tax returns due for all years.\"    At\n\na   revocation  hearing   held  before  a   magistrate  judge\n\n(\"magistrate\"), Huguenin  admitted that he receives a pension\n\nfrom  the United  States Navy  and did  not dispute  that the\n\namount of this pension is approximately $10,000 per year.  He\n\nalso conceded  that he  had not filed  income tax  returns as\n\nordered by the district court  but raised as a defense, inter\n                                                             \n\nalia, that  the income  tax laws  do not  apply to  him.   On\n    \n\nNovember  30,  1993,  the  magistrate  issued  a  report  and\n\nrecommendation  finding   that  Huguenin  had   violated  his\n\nprobation  by failing  to  file written  tax returns  for the\n\nyears 1984, 1985 and 1986.  \n\n          Following  a  hearing on  objections  filed  to the\n\nmagistrate's   report,  the   district   court  adopted   the\n\nmagistrate's  findings and  further  found that  Huguenin had\n\nviolated his probation by failing to file tax returns for the\n\nyears  1987 through  1992.    The  district  court  sentenced\n\nHuguenin on Count  II of the indictment  to a period  of five\n\nyears' imprisonment, but suspended all  but six months of the\n\nsentence,  with the balance  of four and  a half years  to be\n\nspent  on  probation  \"upon  the  same conditions  previously\n\n                             -3-\n\nimposed on  Count  Two.\"   In  addition, the  district  court\n\nimposed a suspended fine of $4,000.  This appeal followed. \n\n                             -4-\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n\n          Huguenin alleges  violations  of his  right to  due\n\nprocess,  under the  Fifth  Amendment, and  his  right to  be\n\ninformed of the nature and cause of accusations  against him,\n\nunder  the Sixth Amendment.   In particular, he contends that\n\nhe was  never informed  what type  of tax he  was being  held\n\nliable for, how  much tax he owed,  or which tax form  he was\n\nsupposed to file.   Huguenin also argues that  the prosecutor\n\nfailed to  prove that  there was  in fact  any  tax \"due  and\n\nowing.\"  Finally, Huguenin contends that the government never\n\nproved the law  which required him to file  a tax return, and\n\nthat he was denied the right to question a witness concerning\n\nthis law.  \n\n          We  note, as an  initial matter, that  the district\n\ncourt  acted appropriately  in imposing,  as  a condition  of\n\nprobation,  that  Huguenin  file  delinquent  and future  tax\n\nreturns,  as well  as pay  any tax  due.   See,  e.g., United\n                                                             \n\nStates   v.  Schiff,  876  F.2d  272,  275  (2d  Cir.  1989).\n                   \n\nMoreover, this condition  of probation mandates no  more than\n\nthe law requires.  Id.  If appellant earns sufficient income,\n                      \n\nhe is required to file an income tax return and pay the taxes\n\nfor which he is responsible.   Id.; see also 26 U.S.C.     1,\n                                            \n\n6011, 6012, 6151; Treas. Reg.   1.6012-1.\n\n                             -5-\n\n          Huguenin's  complaint that  he  was never  informed\n\nwhat  type of tax he was being  held liable for is frivolous.\n\nA  probationer does  have  a  right,  under the  Due  Process\n\nClause,  to  fair  warning  of conduct  that  may  result  in\n\nrevocation.  See, e.g., United States v. Gallo, 20 F.3d 7, 11\n                                              \n\n(1st  Cir. 1994).  However,  Huguenin cannot complain that he\n\nfailed  to  receive  fair warning  where  the  district court\n\nimposed   as  a  formal  probation  condition  that  he  file\n\ndelinquent and future  \"income tax returns,\"  as well as  pay\n\ntax due.   See  United States v.  Simmons, 812 F.2d  561, 565\n                                         \n\n(9th Cir.  1987) (\"Generally, formal  conditions of probation\n\nprovide  notice of  proscribed activities.\").   Moreover, the\n\nInternal Revenue Code and  the regulations promulgated  under\n\nit provided Huguenin with ample notice of his tax liability. \n\n          Appellant's  complaint that  he was  never informed\n\nwhat  form he  was  required to  file  is equally  meritless.\n\nConditions of probation  do not have to spell  out every last\n\ndetail.    See  Gallo,  20  F.3d  at  12.    The  regulations\n                     \n\npromulgated under the Internal Revenue Code provided Huguenin\n\nwith  notice that  either Form  1040  or Form  1040A was  the\n\nappropriate form to use in making an  income tax return.  See\n                                                             \n\nTreas. Reg.    1.6012-1(a)(6).1   We need not linger  long on\n\n                    \n\n1.  Huguenin also  suggests that  after he  was charged  with\nviolating a condition of probation  by failing to file income\ntax returns, the prosecutor was required to  provide him with\n\n                             -6-\n\nappellant's  contention that he  was never informed  how much\n\ntax  he owed and that the government  failed to prove any tax\n\n\"due and owing.\"   The basis of his  probation revocation was\n\nnot  his failure to pay  tax due, but  rather, the failure to\n\nfile his tax returns.  \n\n          Finally, we reject appellant's argument that he was\n\ndenied due process because (a) the prosecutor failed to prove\n\nthe law  which required him  to file income tax  returns; and\n\n(b) he was  deprived of the opportunity to  examine a witness\n\nconcerning  the relevant  law.   Appellant  was charged  with\n\nviolating  a probation condition  set by the  district court.\n\nTo  the extent  that federal  statutes  and regulations  were\n\nrelevant in determining whether  a violation occurred,  these\n\nwere subject to  judicial notice by the district  court.  See\n                                                             \n\n10 James W. Moore &amp; Helen I. Bendix, Moore's Federal Practice\n                                                             \n\n  201.02[1] (2d ed. 1994).   Moreover, the record makes clear\n\nthat  appellant was not  prevented from  presenting favorable\n\nwitnesses.   See United  States v. Morin,  889 F.2d  328, 332\n                                        \n\n(1st  Cir. 1989)  (probationer entitled to  present favorable\n\nwitnesses  at revocation hearing).   Indeed, he  testified on\n\nhis  own  behalf  and  did  not seek  to  present  any  other\n\n                    \n\ncitations to  the Treasury regulations  which (independently)\nmandate  that  he file  these returns  and which  specify the\nappropriate form to file.   We have unearthed no authority to\nsupport  this requirement, and  appellant cites to  none.  We\nobserve  that appellant had the benefit of appointed stand-by\ncounsel, who was  in a position to provide him with this sort\nof legal assistance.  \n\n                             -7-\n\nwitnesses.     Where,  as  here,  the  government  relied  on\n\nappellant's concessions  and did  not put  on any  witnesses,\n\nappellant  cannot  complain  that  he  was  deprived  of  the\n\nopportunity for cross-examination.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                             -8-\n",

See 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7201.  Huguenin was convicted of all three counts on June 15, 1990.  The district court sentenced Huguenin, on Count I, to forty-two months' imprisonment and fined him $5,931.18.

On September 7, 1993, his probation officer filed a petition with the district court charging him with a failure to \"file income tax returns due for all years.\"  At a revocation hearing held before a magistrate judge (\"magistrate\"), Huguenin admitted that he receives a pension from the United States Navy and did not dispute that the amount of this pension is approximately $10,000 per year.  He also conceded that he had not filed income tax returns as ordered by the district court but raised as a defense, inter alia, that the income tax laws do not apply to him.  On November 30, 1993, the magistrate issued a report and recommendation finding that Huguenin had violated his probation by failing to file written tax returns for the years 1984, 1985 and 1986.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a hearing on objections filed to the magistrate's report, the district court adopted the magistrate's findings and further found that Huguenin had violated his probation by failing to file tax returns for the years 1987 through 1992.

This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Huguenin alleges violations of his right to due process, under the Fifth Amendment, and his right to be informed of the nature and cause of accusations against him, under the Sixth Amendment.

If appellant earns sufficient income, he is required to file an income tax return and pay the taxes for which he is responsible.  Id.;  see also 26 U.S.C. Secs. 1, 6011, 6012, 6151;  Treas.  Reg.

However, Huguenin cannot complain that he failed to receive fair warning where the district court imposed as a formal probation condition that he file delinquent and future \"income tax returns,\" as well as pay tax due.   See United States v. Simmons, 812 F.2d 561, 565 (9th Cir. 1987) (\"Generally, formal conditions of probation provide notice of proscribed activities.\").

The regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code provided Huguenin with notice that either Form 1040 or Form 1040A was the appropriate form to use in making an income tax return.  See Treas.  Reg.

Appellant was charged with violating a probation condition set by the district court.  To the extent that federal statutes and regulations were relevant in determining whether a violation occurred, these were subject to judicial notice by the district court.  See 10 James W.

Huguenin appeals pro se from a district court order revoking his probation and sentencing him to an additional period of incarceration.  For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 28, 1989, a grand jury returned a three count indictment charging Huguenin with attempting to evade his income tax obligations for 1984, 1985 and 1986.  See 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7201.  Huguenin was convicted of all three counts on June 15, 1990.  The district court sentenced Huguenin, on Count I, to forty-two months' imprisonment and fined him $5,931.18.  On Count II, the imposition of the sentence was suspended, and the defendant was placed on supervised probation upon release from confinement for three years with the condition that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>defendant is to file all past, present, and future income tax returns for those years where he had income &amp; pay tax that is due.  Defendant to provide copies of tax returns to probation counselor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Count III, the imposition of the sentence was suspended and the defendant was placed on unsupervised probation to be served consecutively to the three years of supervised probation previously imposed on Count II.  We affirmed Huguenin's conviction in an unpublished opinion.  United States v. Robert L. Huguenin, No. 90-1795, 1991 U.S. App.  LEXIS 32842 (1st Cir.  Dec. 4, 1991) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's supervised probation began on August 10, 1993.  On September 7, 1993, his probation officer filed a petition with the district court charging him with a failure to \"file income tax returns due for all years.\"  At a revocation hearing held before a magistrate judge (\"magistrate\"), Huguenin admitted that he receives a pension from the United States Navy and did not dispute that the amount of this pension is approximately $10,000 per year.  He also conceded that he had not filed income tax returns as ordered by the district court but raised as a defense, inter alia, that the income tax laws do not apply to him.  On November 30, 1993, the magistrate issued a report and recommendation finding that Huguenin had violated his probation by failing to file written tax returns for the years 1984, 1985 and 1986.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a hearing on objections filed to the magistrate's report, the district court adopted the magistrate's findings and further found that Huguenin had violated his probation by failing to file tax returns for the years 1987 through 1992.  The district court sentenced Huguenin on Count II of the indictment to a period of five years' imprisonment, but suspended all but six months of the sentence, with the balance of four and a half years to be spent on probation \"upon the same conditions previously imposed on Count Two.\"  In addition, the district court imposed a suspended fine of $4,000.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Huguenin alleges violations of his right to due process, under the Fifth Amendment, and his right to be informed of the nature and cause of accusations against him, under the Sixth Amendment.  In particular, he contends that he was never informed what type of tax he was being held liable for, how much tax he owed, or which tax form he was supposed to file.  Huguenin also argues that the prosecutor failed to prove that there was in fact any tax \"due and owing.\"  Finally, Huguenin contends that the government never proved the law which required him to file a tax return, and that he was denied the right to question a witness concerning this law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, as an initial matter, that the district court acted appropriately in imposing, as a condition of probation, that Huguenin file delinquent and future tax returns, as well as pay any tax due.   See, e.g., United States v. Schiff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524266\"><a href=\"/opinion/524266/united-states-v-irwin-a-schiff/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span>, 275 (2d Cir. 1989).  Moreover, this condition of probation mandates no more than the law requires.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524266\"><a href=\"/opinion/524266/united-states-v-irwin-a-schiff/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> If appellant </a></span>earns sufficient income, he is required to file an income tax return and pay the taxes for which he is responsible.  Id.;  see also 26 U.S.C. Secs. 1, 6011, 6012, 6151;  Treas.  Reg. Sec. 1.6012-1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Huguenin's complaint that he was never informed what type of tax he was being held liable for is frivolous.  A probationer does have a right, under the Due Process Clause, to fair warning of conduct that may result in revocation.   See, e.g., United States v. Gallo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195289\"><a href=\"/opinion/195289/united-states-v-gallo/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir. 1994).  However, Huguenin cannot complain that he failed to receive fair warning where the district court imposed as a formal probation condition that he file delinquent and future \"income tax returns,\" as well as pay tax due.   See United States v. Simmons, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483633\"><a href=\"/opinion/483633/united-states-v-rickey-dean-simmons/\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span>, 565 (9th Cir. 1987) (\"Generally, formal conditions of probation provide notice of proscribed activities.\").  Moreover, the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated under it provided Huguenin with ample notice of his tax liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's complaint that he was never informed what form he was required to file is equally meritless.  Conditions of probation do not have to spell out every last detail.   See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195289\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gallo,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195289/united-states-v-gallo/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>.  The regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code provided Huguenin with notice that either Form 1040 or Form 1040A was the appropriate form to use in making an income tax return.  See Treas.  Reg. Sec. 1.6012-1(a)(6).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We need not linger long on appellant's contention that he was never informed how much tax he owed and that the government failed to prove any tax \"due and owing.\"  The basis of his probation revocation was not his failure to pay tax due, but rather, the failure to file his tax returns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we reject appellant's argument that he was denied due process because (a) the prosecutor failed to prove the law which required him to file income tax returns;  and (b) he was deprived of the opportunity to examine a witness concerning the relevant law.  Appellant was charged with violating a probation condition set by the district court.  To the extent that federal statutes and regulations were relevant in determining whether a violation occurred, these were subject to judicial notice by the district court.  See 10 James W. Moore &amp; Helen I. Bendix, Moore's Federal Practice Sec. 201.02 (2d ed. 1994).  Moreover, the record makes clear that appellant was not prevented from presenting favorable witnesses.   See United States v. Morin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532024\"><a href=\"/opinion/532024/united-states-v-roger-morin-aka-paris-video/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span>, 332 (1st Cir. 1989) (probationer entitled to present favorable witnesses at revocation hearing).  Indeed, he testified on his own behalf and did not seek to present any other witnesses.  Where, as here, the government relied on appellant's concessions and did not put on any witnesses, appellant cannot complain that he was deprived of the opportunity for cross-examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Huguenin also suggests that after he was charged with violating a condition of probation by failing to file income tax returns, the prosecutor was required to provide him with citations to the Treasury regulations which (independently) mandate that he file these returns and which specify the appropriate form to file.  We have unearthed no authority to support this requirement, and appellant cites to none.  We observe that appellant had the benefit of appointed stand-by counsel, who was in a position to provide him with this sort of legal assistance</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
