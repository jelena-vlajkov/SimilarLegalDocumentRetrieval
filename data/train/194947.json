Leanders  H.   Smith  sued   WGBH\n                      \n\nEducational Foundation, Inc. (WGBH)  in state court, alleging\n\nthat it had violated his rights under Massachusetts' workers'\n\ncompensation  laws, M.G.L.  ch.  152,     75A,  75B, when  it\n\nrefused  his request  to  return to  work  after being  on  a\n\ndisability  leave during  which he had  received compensation\n\nbenefits.  WGBH  removed Smith's action  to federal  district\n\ncourt,  and moved  for summary  judgment, which  the district\n\ncourt  granted.   Smith is  appealing that  order as  well as\n\norders denying motions that the court disqualify itself  from\n\nhearing Smith's case, remand his case to the state court, and\n\npermit certain  depositions to  proceed.  We  affirm for  the\n\nreasons stated in the district court's orders, and  elaborate\n\nonly  as  necessary to  clarify  the  court's briefly  stated\n\nreasons.\n\n          1.  Removal/Preemption.  In Magerer v. John  Sexton\n                                                             \n\n&amp;  Co., 912  F.2d  525  (1st  Cir.  1990),  we  held  that  a\n      \n\nretaliatory discharge  claim brought under M.G.L.  ch. 152,  \n\n75B, was  completely preempted under section 301 of the Labor\n\nManagement  Relations  Act, 29  U.S.C.     185(a), where  the\n\nplaintiff was  subject to  a collective bargaining  agreement\n\nwhich  contained  a  management   rights  clause  giving  the\n\nemployer/defendant  the right  to  \"discharge  employees  for\n\nproper cause.\"  Since the  definition of \"proper cause\" under\n\nthe agreement could permit employer discharges  not permitted\n\nunder  section 75B, we found  that the rights and obligations\n\nof  Magerer  and   his  employer  were   controlled  by   the\n\ncontractual  provisions governing  discharge and  not  by any\n\nindependent state standard found in the workers' compensation\n\nlaws of Massachusetts.  Id.  at 530.  In so doing,  we relied\n                           \n\non the specific language in section 75B, which provided that,\n\nif  the  rights granted  employees  under  that section  were\n\ninconsistent  with  a  collective  bargaining  agreement, the\n\nagreement  was   to  prevail.    The   collective  bargaining\n\nagreement  between  WGBH  and  the  National  Association  of\n\nBroadcast   Employees   and   Technicians  (NABET)   contains\n\nessentially  the same  clause  as the  one  we considered  in\n\nMagerer.  Article XIX  of the agreement provides  that \"[t]he\n       \n\nright to  discipline and  discharge employees for  just cause\n\nshall  remain  the  prerogative  of  [WGBH].\"    Thus,  under\n\nMagerer, Smith's section 75B claim requires interpretation of\n       \n\nthe collective bargaining agreement and for that reason it is\n\ncompletely  preempted  under   section  301   of  the   Labor\n\nManagement Relations Act.  Id.\n                              \n\n          The district court's conclusion that  Smith's state\n\nlaw claims  were preempted was  also correct with  respect to\n\nSmith's claim under section  75A.  Like section  75B, section\n\n75A states that an applicable collective bargaining agreement\n\nwhich is inconsistent with the  rights granted in section 75A\n\nis  to  prevail  over section  75A.    Section  75A grants  a\n\npreference  in hiring to any  former employee who  has lost a\n\njob due  to a compensable injury  under workers' compensation\n\n                             -3-\n\nover  other  applicants not  employed at  the time  when such\n\nformer employee \n\nseeks to  be rehired.  As  a general matter, Article  13.1 of\n\nWGBH's collective bargaining  agreement gives WGBH  \"the sole\n\nand  exclusive  right to  make  all  decisions regarding  the\n\nmanagement,  operation and  programming of  [its] operations,\n\nincluding determination of the number of employees covered by\n\nthis  Agreement,\" suggesting that  WGBH may hire  or not hire\n\nemployees as it sees fit and that it is not required to grant\n\nany  preference  to  former  employees who  have  lost  their\n\nemployment  due to injuries  compensable under Massachusetts'\n\nworkers' compensation law.   More specifically, Article  17.3\n\nof the  agreement requires WGBH to  rehire laid-off employees\n\naccording to seniority.  For certain types of available work,\n\nmoreover,  Article  3.7(a) also  states  a  hiring preference\n\nbased on seniority  for regular staff employees who have been\n\nlaid  off.   The  seniority principle  for rehiring  laid-off\n\nemployees   is  inconsistent   with   section  75A's   hiring\n\npreference for  employees laid  off or discharged  because of\n\ninjuries    compensable    under   Massachusetts'    workers'\n\ncompensation  law.   Thus,  under the  reasoning of  Magerer,\n                                                            \n\nSmith's  section  75A claim  requires  interpretation  of the\n\ncollective bargaining agreement and  for that reason it, too,\n\nis completely preempted.  \n\n                             -4-\n\n          Since Smith's claim  is completely preempted  under\n\nsection  301, it states a federal claim and thus arises under\n\nfederal law, Caterpillar, Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 393\n                                          \n\n(1987); Avco  Corp. v. Aero Lodge No.  735, 390 U.S. 557, 560\n                                          \n\n(1968); Magerer, 912 F.2d at 528, and not under Massachusetts\n               \n\nlaw.  Consequently, 28 U.S.C.   1445(c), which  prohibits the\n\nremoval  to federal  court of  claims arising  under  a state\n\nworkmen's compensation  law, does  not apply, and  removal of\n\nthe  claim here  was proper.   See  Vantine v.  Elkhart Brass\n                                                             \n\nManufacturing  Co.,  762 F.2d  511,  517-18  (7th Cir.  1985)\n                  \n\n(section 1445(c) did not bar removal of a claim brought under\n\na  state's  workmen's  compensation laws;  under  the state's\n\nlaws,  the  cause  of   action  arose  under  the  collective\n\nbargaining agreement  and thus  stated a federal  claim under\n\nsection  301 which  rendered  removal to  the district  court\n\nproper);  Smith v.  Union Carbide  Corporation, 664  F. Supp.\n                                              \n\n290, 292  (E.D.  Tenn. 1987)  (section  1445(c) did  not  bar\n\nremoval  of  an  action  brought under  a  state's  workmen's\n\ncompensation  law  because  the   plaintiff's  suit  was   an\n\nindependent, judicially  created tort action, and  so did not\n\narise  under the  state's  workmen's  compensation laws,  and\n\nbecause it  was preempted by federal labor  law and therefore\n\narose under federal and not state law).  2.           Smith's\n                                                             \n\nEmployment Status as of August 1989.  If Smith was subject to\n                                   \n\nWGBH's collective bargaining agreement, dismissal of his suit\n\n                             -5-\n\nwas proper since his only remedy for his discharge was resort\n\nto   the  grievance  and   arbitration  procedures   of  that\n\nagreement.  See Allis-Chalmers Corporation v. Lueck, 471 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n202, 220-21 (1985).   In affidavits,  Smith claimed that  his\n\nemployment at WGBH had  ended before August 1989 and  that he\n\nwas  not  subject  to the  WGBH-NABET  collective  bargaining\n\nagreement.  Accordingly, he argues that he was not bound by a\n\n1990 arbitral  decision which found that  WGBH had discharged\n\nhim  for just cause,  and he says  that he is  free to sue in\n\ncourt.  In view of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary,\n\nwe find that  his allegations do not establish  the existence\n\nof  a genuine  issue of  material fact  sufficient to  defeat\n\nWGBH's motion  for summary judgment.  Petitti  v. New England\n                                                             \n\nTelephone  &amp; Telegraph Co., 909  F.2d 28, 30  (1st Cir. 1990)\n                          \n\n(summary judgment is proper if evidence is so  one-sided that\n\none party must prevail as a matter of law).\n\n          Smith claims  that  his employment  had  terminated\n\nbefore August  1989 under  Article 17.2(f) of  the collective\n\nbargaining  agreement.   That  article provided  for loss  of\n\nseniority by  employees absent  from work due  to injury  for\n\nmore than 15  months, and  was understood by  the parties  to\n\nterminate  the employment  of such employees.   As  of August\n\n1989, Smith had  been on  disability leave for  more than  15\n\nmonths,  having  begun his  leave in  February  1986.   In an\n\naffidavit, WGBH's Human Resources Director, Michael Enwright,\n\n                             -6-\n\nwho  negotiated  WGBH's 1987-90  contract with  NABET, stated\n\nthat  WGBH  had  accepted  the union's  demand  during  those\n\nnegotiations  that Smith  be excluded  from the  operation of\n\nArticle  17.2(f).   Smith's disability  leave began  in 1986,\n\nwhen the 1984-87 contract was  in effect, and Enwright stated\n\nin  his affidavit that that contract  did not contain Article\n\n17.2(f).  Smith has not introduced any affidavit by the union\n\nto the contrary, nor has he denied Enwright's sworn statement\n\nthat the 1984-87 contract did not contain Article 17.2(f).  \n\n          In an  affidavit, Smith states  that John  Plausse,\n\nhis  direct supervisor, had told him during his leave that he\n\nwas  not subject  to  the  collective  bargaining  agreement.\n\nNevertheless,  the  pleadings,   affidavits  and   underlying\n\ndocumentary   evidence   submitted   by   the   parties  show\n\nconclusively that, even if Plausse had told Smith that he was\n\nnot subject  to  the collective  bargaining agreement,  Smith\n\nknew  that his employment  with WGBH had  not been terminated\n\nbefore August 1989 and that he continued to be subject to the\n\ncollective bargaining  agreement.   Among the many  pieces of\n\nevidence, we highlight only the following:  Smith's complaint\n\nstating  that on or about November 22, 1989, WGBH had refused\n\nto allow him  to \"return to work\"; Smith's letter  to WGBH on\n\nAugust 2,  1989, notifying  Enwright that Smith  was changing\n\nhis  \"return  to  work\"  date  from  September  18, 1989,  to\n\nSeptember 1, 1989,  telling Enwright to  let Plausse know  of\n\n                             -7-\n\nthe change so that Plausse could make necessary plans, asking\n\nEnwright  whether his  vacation  time had  been adjusted  and\n\ninforming  Enwright that  he would  be taking  the first  two\n\nweeks  of  October  off;  the  arbitration  transcript  which\n\nreveals that  the union arbitrated Smith's  November 22, 1989\n\ndischarge (for misconduct not at issue here), that  Smith was\n\nconsulted about and approved  NABET's and WGBH's selection of\n\nan  arbitrator, and  that Smith  attended the  arbitration on\n\ndates in 1989  and 1990  and actively assisted  the union  in\n\npresenting  evidence on  his  behalf; and  Smith's  affidavit\n\nstating  that he  is  still a  member  of NABET,  a  critical\n\nadmission since  membership in  the union  is a  condition of\n\nemployment under  the collective  bargaining agreement.   See\n                                                             \n\nAgreement Between NABET and WGBH Educational Foundation, Inc.\n\n1987-1990,  Art. 3.1.    Although Smith  argues that  certain\n\nletters  and documents show that  he was not  an employee for\n\nany purpose under the collective bargaining agreement  during\n\nhis  leave, those letters and documents show only that he was\n\nnot  classified as an \"active\" employee at that time and thus\n\ndid  not have the  rights granted active  employees under the\n\nagreement (e.g., vacation, sick leave, and holiday benefits).\n\nThe  collective  bargaining  agreement distinguishes  clearly\n\nbetween  the rights  of active  employees and  those of  non-\n\nactive employees  on leave of  absence (see,  e.g., id.  Art.\n                                                       \n\n9.5(c), 9.7;  Art. XII);  nowhere does  it suggest that  non-\n\n                             -8-\n\nactive employees on leave  are not in the bargaining  unit or\n\nnot subject  to the  grievance and arbitration  provisions of\n\nthe contract.  \n\n          Smith's  other  claims are  without  merit for  the\n\nreasons stated in the orders being appealed.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -9-\n",

John  Sexton\n                                                             \n\n&amp;  Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547203\"><a href=\"/opinion/547203/david-a-magerer-v-john-sexton-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">912</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">525</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st  Cir.  1990),  we  held  that  a\n      \n\nretaliatory discharge  claim brought under M.G.L.  ch. 152,  \n\n75B, was  completely preempted under section 301 of the Labor\n\nManagement  Relations  Act, 29  U.S.C.     185(a), where  the\n\nplaintiff was  subject to  a collective bargaining  agreement\n\nwhich  contained  a  management   rights  clause  giving  the\n\nemployer/defendant  the right  to  \"discharge  employees  for\n\nproper cause.\"  Since the  definition of \"proper cause\" under\n\nthe agreement could permit employer discharges  not permitted\n\nunder  section 75B, we found  that the rights and obligations\n\nof  Magerer  and   his  employer  were   controlled  by   the\n\ncontractual  provisions governing  discharge and  not  by any\n\nindependent state standard found in the workers' compensation\n\nlaws of Massachusetts.  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547203\"><a href=\"/opinion/547203/david-a-magerer-v-john-sexton-co/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  at 530. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> In so doing,  we relied\n                           \n\non the specific language in section 75B, which provided that,\n\nif  the  rights granted  employees  under  that section  were\n\ninconsistent  with  a  collective  bargaining  agreement, the\n\nagreement  was   to  prevail.    The   collective  bargaining\n\nagreement  between  WGBH  and  the  National  Association  of\n\nBroadcast   Employees   and   Technicians  (NABET)   contains\n\nessentially  the same  clause  as the  one  we considered  in\n\nMagerer.  Article XIX  of the agreement provides  that \"[t]he\n       \n\nright to  discipline and  discharge employees for  just cause\n\nshall  remain  the  prerogative  of  [WGBH].\"    Thus,  under\n\nMagerer, Smith's section 75B claim requires interpretation of\n       \n\nthe collective bargaining agreement and for that reason it is\n\ncompletely  preempted  under   section  301   of  the   Labor\n\nManagement Relations Act.  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547203\"><a href=\"/opinion/547203/david-a-magerer-v-john-sexton-co/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\n                              \n\n          The district </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">court's conclusion that  Smith's state\n\nlaw claims  were preempted was  also correct with  respect to\n\nSmith's claim under section  75A.  Like section  75B, section\n\n75A states that an applicable collective bargaining agreement\n\nwhich is inconsistent with the  rights granted in section 75A\n\nis  to  prevail  over section  75A.    Section  75A grants  a\n\npreference  in hiring to any  former employee who  has lost a\n\njob due  to a compensable injury  under workers' compensation\n\n                             -3-\n\nover  other  applicants not  employed at  the time  when such\n\nformer employee \n\nseeks to  be rehired.  As  a general matter, Article  13.1 of\n\nWGBH's collective bargaining  agreement gives WGBH  \"the sole\n\nand  exclusive  right to  make  all  decisions regarding  the\n\nmanagement,  operation and  programming of  [its] operations,\n\nincluding determination of the number of employees covered by\n\nthis  Agreement,\" suggesting that  WGBH may hire  or not hire\n\nemployees as it sees fit and that it is not required to grant\n\nany  preference  to  former  employees who  have  lost  their\n\nemployment  due to injuries  compensable under Massachusetts'\n\nworkers' compensation law.   More specifically, Article  17.3\n\nof the  agreement requires WGBH to  rehire laid-off employees\n\naccording to seniority.  For certain types of available work,\n\nmoreover,  Article  3.7(a) also  states  a  hiring preference\n\nbased on seniority  for regular staff employees who have been\n\nlaid  off.   The  seniority principle  for rehiring  laid-off\n\nemployees   is  inconsistent   with   section  75A's   hiring\n\npreference for  employees laid  off or discharged  because of\n\ninjuries    compensable    under   Massachusetts'    workers'\n\ncompensation  law.   Thus,  under the  reasoning of  Magerer,\n                                                            \n\nSmith's  section  75A claim  requires  interpretation  of the\n\ncollective bargaining agreement and  for that reason it, too,\n\nis completely preempted.  \n\n                             -4-\n\n          Since Smith's claim  is completely preempted  under\n\nsection  301, it states a federal claim and thus arises under\n\nfederal law, Caterpillar, Inc. v.

See Allis-Chalmers Corporation v.

In affidavits,  Smith claimed that  his\n\nemployment at WGBH had  ended before August 1989 and  that he\n\nwas  not  subject  to the  WGBH-NABET  collective  bargaining\n\nagreement.  Accordingly, he argues that he was not bound by a\n\n1990 arbitral  decision which found that  WGBH had discharged\n\nhim  for just cause,  and he says  that he is  free to sue in\n\ncourt.  In view of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary,\n\nwe find that  his allegations do not establish  the existence\n\nof  a genuine  issue of  material fact  sufficient to  defeat\n\nWGBH's motion  for summary judgment.

New England\n                                                             \n\nTelephone  &amp; Telegraph Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545207\"><a href=\"/opinion/545207/54-fair-emplpraccas-142-54-empl-prac-dec-p-40108-robert-p-petitti/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 30  (1st Cir. 1990)\n                          \n\n(summary judgment is proper if evidence is so  one-sided that\n\none party must prevail as a matter of law).\n\n          Smith claims  that  his employment  had  terminated\n\nbefore August  1989 under  Article 17.2(f) of  the collective\n\nbargaining  agreement.   That  article provided  for loss  of\n\nseniority by  employees absent  from work due  to injury  for\n\nmore than 15  months, and  was understood by  the parties  to\n\nterminate  the employment  of such employees.   As  of August\n\n1989, Smith had  been on  disability leave for  more than  15\n\nmonths,  having  begun his  leave in  February  1986.   In an\n\naffidavit, WGBH's Human Resources Director, Michael Enwright,\n\n                             -6-\n\nwho  negotiated  WGBH's 1987-90  contract with  NABET, stated\n\nthat  WGBH  had  accepted  the union's  demand  during  those\n\nnegotiations  that Smith  be excluded  from the  operation of\n\nArticle  17.2(f).   Smith's disability  leave began  in 1986,\n\nwhen the 1984-87 contract was  in effect, and Enwright stated\n\nin  his affidavit that that contract  did not contain Article\n\n17.2(f).  Smith has not introduced any affidavit by the union\n\nto the contrary, nor has he denied Enwright's sworn statement\n\nthat the 1984-87 contract did not contain Article 17.2(f).  \n\n          In an  affidavit, Smith states  that John  Plausse,\n\nhis  direct supervisor, had told him during his leave that he\n\nwas  not subject  to  the  collective  bargaining  agreement.\n\nNevertheless,  the  pleadings,   affidavits  and   underlying\n\ndocumentary   evidence   submitted   by   the   parties  show\n\nconclusively that, even if Plausse had told Smith that he was\n\nnot subject  to  the collective  bargaining agreement,  Smith\n\nknew  that his employment  with WGBH had  not been terminated\n\nbefore August 1989 and that he continued to be subject to the\n\ncollective bargaining  agreement.   Among the many  pieces of\n\nevidence, we highlight only the following:  Smith's complaint\n\nstating  that on or about November 22, 1989, WGBH had refused\n\nto allow him  to \"return to work\"; Smith's letter  to WGBH on\n\nAugust 2,  1989, notifying  Enwright that Smith  was changing\n\nhis  \"return  to  work\"  date  from  September  18, 1989,  to\n\nSeptember 1, 1989,  telling Enwright to  let Plausse know  of\n\n                             -7-\n\nthe change so that Plausse could make necessary plans, asking\n\nEnwright  whether his  vacation  time had  been adjusted  and\n\ninforming  Enwright that  he would  be taking  the first  two\n\nweeks  of  October  off;  the  arbitration  transcript  which\n\nreveals that  the union arbitrated Smith's  November 22, 1989\n\ndischarge (for misconduct not at issue here), that  Smith was\n\nconsulted about and approved  NABET's and WGBH's selection of\n\nan  arbitrator, and  that Smith  attended the  arbitration on\n\ndates in 1989  and 1990  and actively assisted  the union  in\n\npresenting  evidence on  his  behalf; and  Smith's  affidavit\n\nstating  that he  is  still a  member  of NABET,  a  critical\n\nadmission since  membership in  the union  is a  condition of\n\nemployment under  the collective  bargaining agreement.   See\n                                                             \n\nAgreement Between NABET and WGBH Educational Foundation, Inc.\n\n1987-1990,  Art. 3.1.    Although Smith  argues that  certain\n\nletters  and documents show that  he was not  an employee for\n\nany purpose under the collective bargaining agreement  during\n\nhis  leave, those letters and documents show only that he was\n\nnot  classified as an \"active\" employee at that time and thus\n\ndid  not have the  rights granted active  employees under the\n\nagreement (e.g., vacation, sick leave, and holiday benefits).\n\nThe  collective  bargaining  agreement distinguishes  clearly\n\nbetween  the rights  of active  employees and  those of  non-\n\nactive employees  on leave of  absence (see,  e.g., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545207\"><a href=\"/opinion/545207/54-fair-emplpraccas-142-54-empl-prac-dec-p-40108-robert-p-petitti/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  Art.\n                                                       \n\n9.5(c), </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">9.7;  Art.
