Here,  we quote only those facts relevant to this\n\nappeal.\n\n                Condominium Bah a-A (hereinafter \"the\n            Condominium\")   is  a   234-unit  housing\n            project  which  was originally  owned and\n            developed    by   the    Corporaci n   de\n            Renovaci n Urbana y Vivienda  (\"CRUV\"), a\n            now-defunct public housing agency  of the\n            Puerto Rican Government.  On November 11,\n            1972, CRUV  opened  an account  with  the\n            Puerto Rico Aqueduct and  Sewer Authority\n            (\"PRASA\")  for  water and  sewer services\n            for the Condominium.1  The  PRASA account\n            served   all  of   the   units   of   the\n            Condominium   through  a   single  meter.\n            PRASA  thereafter  billed  and  collected\n            from  CRUV for  water and  sewer services\n            provided to the Condominium.\n\n                In  early  1973,  ownership   of  the\n            Condominium was passed to  its residents.\n\n                    \n\n1  PRASA  is the sole  provider of water  services within  Puerto\nRico.   It is a public  corporation created by virtue  of Law No.\n33, of June 27, 1985, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27,   262 et seq.\n                                                          \n\n                               -4-\n\n            A  Council of  Owners of  the Condominium\n            Bah a-A  (\"the Council\")  was constituted\n            to, among other  things, \"administer  all\n            phases  and  aspects\" of  the Condominium\n            including  \"contract[ing]  all  necessary\n            services.\"   On  February 14,  1973,  the\n            Council and the Board of Directors of the\n            Condominium  notified Banco  de Vivienda,\n            the mortgagor of the property,  that they\n            had  taken over the administration of the\n            Condominium.\n\n                [The  residents]  have  alleged  that\n            when they purchased their properties from\n            CRUV they  were  told, as  an  incentive,\n            that CRUV  would continue to  pay for all\n            water and  sewer services.  CRUV  in fact\n            continued to  be billed  and  to pay  for\n            these  services until October 1, 1981, at\n            which time CRUV  requested to [sic] PRASA\n            that  it  cancel  the  account   for  the\n            Condominium.\n\n                For almost four years after  the CRUV\n            account for the Condominium was canceled,\n            PRASA made no effort to  collect from the\n            Condominium's  residents  for  water  and\n            sewer services provided.   No explanation\n            has been provided for this situation.  On\n            July 12, 1985, PRASA requested in writing\n            that the Condominium,  through its  Board\n            of  Directors, place a bond with PRASA to\n            register an account  in its name.   PRASA\n            warned  that the  failure to  register an\n            account could lead to suspension of water\n            services.  On July  22, 1985, the Council\n            answered PRASA's request  by refusing  to\n            pay  for  any  water and  sewer  services\n            unless  individual meters  were installed\n            for  each of the apartments.\"  (citations\n            omitted).\n\n829 F. Supp. at 524-25.\n\n          Between September  of 1985 and December  of 1989, PRASA\n\nofficials  had  several  meetings  with  representatives  of  the\n\nCouncil  and at  least  one meeting  with  the residents  of  the\n\nCondominium to  discuss the situation.   See id.  at 525.   PRASA\n                                                \n\n                               -5-\n\nrepeatedly \"requested  that the  Condominium register  an account\n\nand place the  required bond  for the water  and sewer  services.\n\nPRASA proposed a plan whereby  the pending debt could be paid  in\n\ninstallments.  The residents rejected PRASA's proposals and again\n\ninsisted on the installation of individual meters, to be paid for\n\nby PRASA or CRUV.\"   Id. \n                        \n\n                On July 24, 1990,  PRASA unilaterally\n            opened  an  account   on  behalf  of  the\n            Condominium  and  began  issuing  monthly\n            bills.  The account was not requested  by\n            the Condominium and  the Condominium  did\n            not  place a  bond with  PRASA.   None of\n            these bills were paid or  responded to in\n            any  fashion  by  the  Condominium.    On\n            April 3,    1991,   through    a   letter\n            personally    delivered    to   Francisca\n            Marrero, the  new President of  the Board\n            of  Directors  of the  Condominium, PRASA\n            requested  a payment  in  the  amount  of\n            $448,872.08  for services  rendered under\n            the  account.    PRASA  stated  that  the\n            failure  to pay or  submit a proposal for\n            payment would result in the suspension of\n            the water services after 20 days.  A copy\n            of the letter to Marrero was delivered to\n            each  unit  along  with   another  letter\n            urging  the residents  to take  action to\n            avoid suspension of services.\n\n                [The  residents]  have  alleged  that\n            Marrero  requested  on several  occasions\n            that  a  meeting  be  arranged  with  the\n            Executive  Director  of PRASA,  defendant\n            Mar a Margarita Irizarry, to  discuss the\n            situation  and  that  her  requests  were\n            refused.  [The residents] charge that the\n            failure to grant the  requests for such a\n            hearing violated their due process rights\n            as established under Puerto Rico law.2\n\n                    \n\n2  Under  the Act  to Establish Procedural  Requirements for  the\nSuspension of Essential Public Services, P.R.  Laws Ann. tit. 27,\n  262, all public agencies providing essential services must have\nan administrative  procedure for the suspension  of such services\nfor nonpayment.  PRASA is one  of the agencies which must  comply\n\n                               -6-\n\n                On April 24, 1991,  21 days after the\n            delivery  of  the  Marrero letter,  water\n            service to the Condominium was suspended.\n            On  May  3, 1991,  after  the Condominium\n            agreed to  place a bond in  the amount of\n            $5,000.00 to cover current monthly bills,\n            the service was  reinstated.  Two  months\n            later,  PRASA filed  a  complaint in  the\n            Superior Court  of  Puerto Rico  for  the\n            collection  of the amounts owed for water\n            and  sewer  services  since 1981.    This\n            complaint  was  thereafter filed  seeking\n            relief    based    on    the    allegedly\n            unconstitutional  10-day  deprivation  of\n            water and sewer services.\n\nId. at 525-26.\n   \n\n          The only  issue before the district  court was \"whether\n\n[the residents]  suffered a  deprivation of their  procedural due\n\nprocess rights resulting from  PRASA's 10-day suspension of water\n\nservice  to the Condominium Bah a-A.\"  Id. at 527.   The district\n                                          \n\ncourt  stated that \"[t]he  procedural due  process clause  of the\n\nFourteenth  Amendment   guarantees  citizens  with   a  protected\n\nproperty  interest the right to  notice and an  opportunity to be\n\nheard  prior to a deprivation of  such a property interest by the\n\ngovernment\" and that \"[a] threshold issue in this case is whether\n\n[the residents] enjoyed a  protectable 'property' interest in the\n\nwater  service which  was suspended.\"   Id.   The  district court\n                                           \n\n                    \n\nwith this statute.   P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 2,    262a.  The statute\nrequires  that the  agency allow  a consumer,  upon receiving  an\nadverse  decision by a  regional official within  the agency, the\nopportunity to have  a hearing before  the executive director  of\nthe agency.   P.R. Laws  Ann. tit. 27,    262b(c); see  also P.R.\n                                                            \nLaws Ann. tit. 27,   262b(e)(if  such a hearing is requested, the\nconsumer must pay  an amount  equal to his  average monthly  bill\nbefore the hearing is held).   In addition, at no time while such\nadministrative  procedures are  being  developed may  the  agency\nsuspend the service.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27,   262b(d).\n\n                               -7-\n\nindicated that \"if such  a property interest does not  exist, the\n\ndue  process clause provides no  protection.\"  Id.   Finding that\n                                                  \n\n\"plaintiffs had no property interest in the continued  receipt of\n\nwater  services for  which they  never contracted,\"  the district\n\ncourt dismissed the case.  Id. at 529.\n                              \n\n                               III.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n                   A.  Issues of Material Fact\n\n          The  residents first  argue  that  this case  presented\n\nunresolved issues  of material fact, which  rendered the district\n\ncourt's  grant  of  summary  judgment   erroneous.    A  fact  is\n\n\"material\"  when it has \"the  potential to affect  the outcome of\n\nthe suit under  the applicable law.\"  Nereida-Gonz lez v.

While this case may\n       \n\npresent  unresolved   issues  of  fact,  we   disagree  with  the\n\nresidents'  contention that  these disputes  are material  to the\n\nresolution  of this action.  In particular, the residents contend\n\nthat  a  determination  of  whether CRUV  owed  the  residents  a\n\ncontractual  duty to pay the  water services is  material to this\n\ndispute.   The residents also  contend that the  issue of whether\n\nthe residents were \"clandestine users\" of the water  services was\n\nan unresolved issue of material fact.\n\n          We disagree  with the residents' conclusion  that these\n\nmatters  are material  to the  resolution of  this dispute.   The\n\nexistence  of  any contractual  agreement  between  CRUV and  the\n\nresidents  is irrelevant to the issue before us, that is, whether\n\n                               -8-\n\nat the  time PRASA disconnected the water  service, the residents\n\nhad a  protected property  interest in  the continued  receipt of\n\nwater services.   A determination  of whether the  residents were\n\n\"clandestine users\" is also unnecessary to the resolution of this\n\ncase as  regardless  of whether  or  not they  were  \"clandestine\n\nusers,\"  they still have not claimed  any facts that, if taken as\n\ntrue,  would establish that they  had a property  interest in the\n\ncontinued service of water.  Other allegedly unresolved issues of\n\nfact  raised by  the  residents are  equally  immaterial to  this\n\ndispute.\n\n                 B.

In Board of Regents, the  Supreme Court of\n                                          \n\nthe United States held that:\n\n            To have a property interest in a benefit,\n            a person  clearly must have more  than an\n            abstract need for it.   He must have more\n            than a unilateral expectation  of it.  He\n            must, instead, have a legitimate claim of\n            entitlement  to  it.  .  .  .

Plaintiffs do  not cite any  provisions of\n\nPuerto  Rico  law  nor  any cases  to  support  their  position.3\n\nApplying basic principles of contract law, we find their position\n\nuntenable.   Because Puerto Rico  is a civil  law jurisdiction we\n\nalso look to its substantive law to determine whether a different\n\noutcome is forthcoming.\n\n          Assuming,  for purposes  of this  appeal, that  PRASA's\n\naction of opening an account and its continued rendition of water\n\nservices  to the  residents were  valid offers  to contract,  the\n\nresidents would still be  unable to establish the existence  of a\n\ncontract.   See Farnsworth at 135-136 (\"One who begins to perform\n                          \n\n                    \n\n3   In many jurisdictions  an offer does  not require formalities\nand can  be made by  either written words  or other conduct.

PRASA  repeatedly  requested the\n         \n\nCondominium  to place a  bond and to register  an account.  PRASA\n\nalso made  it  clear  to  the  residents  that  in  order  to  be\n\nconsidered \"registered users\" with  PRASA, they had to  apply for\n\nwater   service  and  place   a  bond  in   accordance  with  the\n\nrequirements set  forth in  PRASA's rules  and regulations.   The\n\n                    \n\n4  Puerto Rico law establishes that:\n\n          There is no  contract unless  the following  requisites\nexist:\n\n            (1)  The   consent  of   the  contracting\n                 parties.\n            (2)  A  definite object which  may be the\n                 subject of the contract.\n            (3)  The cause for  the obligation  which\n                 may be established.\n\nP.R.

We disagree with  plaintiffs' contention that\n\nthose meetings suggested the existence of such a contract.  These\n\nmeetings  were merely  discussions or negotiations  regarding who\n\nshould pay for the installation of individual water meters in the\n\nCondominium, whether the  residents were required to pay for past\n\nservices rendered, and conditions for future water  service.  See\n                                                                 \n\nCoghlan at  570  (negotiations  over backbill and  billing errors\n       \n\nalone could not establish the type of property interests required\n\nto raise disconnection  of water  service to a  deprivation of  a\n\n                               -12-\n\nvaluable property right).\n\n          The  residents next  contend  that  the district  court\n\nerred  in concluding that  Puerto Rico law did  not confer on the\n\nresidents a property interest in continued water service.\n\n          We look  to Puerto  Rico statutes to  determine whether\n\nPuerto Rico law conferred such a property interest.  See Coghlan,\n                                                                \n\n845 F.2d  at 569.    Plaintiffs argue  that  Section 159  of  the\n\nAqueduct and  Sewer Act of Puerto Rico, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 22,  \n\n141 et seq.,  establishes a property interest  in continued water\n           \n\nservices.  Section  159 authorizes PRASA  to establish rules  and\n\nregulations  concerning the  use  and conservation  of water  and\n\nprovides, in relevant part,  that the purpose for which  PRASA is\n\ncreated is:\n\n            that the health of the inhabitants of the\n            Island  of Puerto Rico shall be attained,\n            that the health of the inhabitants of the\n            Island    shall  be  protected,  that the\n            water  available shall be utilized in the\n            fullest  measure  possible  and  that  it\n            shall be made available to  the consumers\n            with the greatest possible regularity and\n            continuity.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 22,   159 (1989).\n\n          The  residents contend that they are \"consumers\" within\n\nthe meaning  of Section  159 and  as such  have  a state  created\n\nproperty  interest in regular and  continuous water services.  We\n\nneed  not  determine  whether  Section  159  creates  a  property\n\ninterest in consumers because  we do not believe that  plaintiffs\n\nare \"consumers.\"  The Aqueduct and Sewer Act  does not define the\n\nterm  \"consumer.\"   Neither do  the  Regulations issued  by PRASA\n\n                               -13-\n\nprovide  a  definition  of the  term.    The  residents have  not\n\nproffered  any other  authoritative  interpretation  of the  term\n\n\"consumer\"  which would  indicate they  were included  within the\n\nmeaning  of the word.   We interpret the  term \"consumer\" in this\n\ncontext  to be  limited  to persons  who  pay or  otherwise  give\n\nconsideration for  goods or services  rendered.  We  believe this\n\ninterpretation is consistent with the common understanding of the\n\nterm.  It is also  consistent with a basic tenet of  the Aqueduct\n\nand Sewer Authority, namely that \"[t]he Authority shall render no\n\nfree Services.\"  P.R. Laws Ann.  tit. 22,   158.  In the  present\n\ncase,  the  residents  refused  to  comply  with  the  procedures\n\nestablished by  PRASA that would  give them consumer  status with\n\nrespect  to PRASA.  They refused to  register an account, place a\n\nbond  or  pay  for water  services.    Therefore,  they were  not\n\n\"consumers\" as we interpret that term under Section 159.\n\n          In the alternative, the residents contend that they are\n\n\"users\"5  of the  aqueduct and  sewer services,  as that  term is\n\n                    \n\n5  In its definition section, the Regulations for Administrative-\nLegal Procedures  of PRASA provides the  following definitions of\n\"users\":\n\n            User - Person who enjoys  the services of\n            User\n            aqueducts  and/or   sewer  including  any\n            person  or entity  who discharges  in the\n            sanitary system, whether said person is a\n            subscriber or not.\n\n            (a) Subscriber user -  Person who enjoys the aqueduct\n                Subscriber user\n            and  sewer services  registered  in the  name of  the\n            Authority.\n            (b)  Non-subscriber  user  -  Person  who enjoys  the\n                 Non-subscriber  user\n            aqueduct and sewer services registered in the name of\n            another person.\n            (c)  Clandestine user - Person who enjoys\n                 Clandestine user\n\n                               -14-\n\ndefined  in  PRASA  regulations  and  as  such,  have  a property\n\ninterest in continued  services.  The residents  have not pointed\n\nto any  legal  authority  which  indicates that  \"users\"  have  a\n\nproperty interest in water services.  Rather,the residents merely\n\nargue that somehow PRASA's regulations defining \"user\" to include\n\n\"non-subscriber-users\"  and  \"clandestine-users\"   give  them   a\n\nproperty interest in water services.  They rely on the regulatory\n\ndefinition of \"Aqueduct Service\" as \"water supply for the benefit\n\nof  a  subscriber  or user\"  as  a  basis  for this  proposition.\n                          \n\nRegulation for Administrative-Legal Procedures of the Puerto Rico\n\nAqueducts and Sewer Authority, Chap. II (emphasis added).  \n\n          The  residents  have cited  no  authority,  and we  are\n\nunable to find any,  indicating that regulatory definitions alone\n\nare  sufficient to establish  a property interest.   The relevant\n\ncase-law is  to the contrary  and suggests that  these regulatory\n\ndefinitions cannot  establish a  constitutional right  to receive\n\nwater services.  See Coghlan, 845 F.2d at 570 n.3 (examination of\n                            \n\ncharter  creating  waterworks  and  other  sub-statutory  sources\n\nincluding regulatory  statements, for a  provision establishing a\n\nright  to water services is unnecessary and improper);  Gorham v.\n                                                              \n\nHutto, 667  F.2d 1146 (4th Cir.  1981) (administrative guidelines\n     \n\nare not a  sufficient basis  for the  creation of  a due  process\n\ninterest); Bills  v.

We\n\ntherefore conclude  that the regulatory definitions  on which the\n\nresidents  rely do not provide  a sufficient basis  for finding a\n\nproperty interest. \n\n          Finally, even  if the residents were  able to establish\n\nthat they  had a protected  property interest in  continued water\n\nservice, they were not deprived of due process.  The question  of\n\nwhat  process is due is a question of federal constitutional law.\n\nCleveland  Brd. of Educ. v.

In 1986,\n\nPRASA  began sending  the Board  of Directors of  the Condominium\n\nnotices warning that failure to  place a bond and to register  an\n\naccount on behalf of the Condominium could lead to the suspension\n\n                               -16-\n\nof water services.   PRASA officials also  met with the Board  of\n\nDirectors and  with the residents  of the Condominium  to discuss\n\nthe  situation and proposed a plan  whereby the Condominium could\n\npay  the pending debt in  installments.    The residents rejected\n\nthe proposed plan.  In 1990, PRASA unilaterally opened an account\n\non  behalf of  the Condominium  and began issuing  monthly bills.\n\nThe Condominium neither paid these bills nor responded to them in\n\nany fashion.  On April 3, 1991,  PRASA  delivered a letter to the\n\nPresident of the Board of Directors of the Condominium requesting\n\na payment  in the  amount  of $448,872.08  for services  rendered\n\nunder  the  account.   PRASA stated  that the  failure to  pay or\n\nsubmit  a proposal for payments would result in the suspension of\n\nwater  services after  twenty days.   A  copy of  the  letter was\n\ndelivered to  each  unit along  with  another letter  urging  the\n\nresidents to take action to avoid the suspension of services.\n\n          In determining the adequacy  of the procedures afforded\n\nthe residents we balance  the competing interests at stake.   Id.\n                                                                 \n\nThese  are the  residents'  private interest  in continued  water\n\nservice, PRASA's  interest in receiving payment  for its services\n\nand the avoidance of  administrative burdens, and the risk  of an\n\nerroneous  deprivation  of  water   services.    See  Mathews  v.\n                                                             \n\nEldridge,  424  U.S. 319,  335 (1976).    The receipt  of utility\n        \n\nservices is a  necessity of  modern day life  and undoubtedly  an\n\nimportant  interest,  however,    PRASA's interest  in  receiving\n\npayment  for its  services  is also  significant.   It  would  be\n\nunreasonable to expect PRASA  to continue providing free services\n\n                               -17-\n\nto the  residents indefinitely.  PRASA gave  the residents notice\n\non several occasions of its  intention to discontinue services if\n\nthe  residents  did   not  comply  with  PRASA's   administrative\n\nrequirements.    PRASA  officials  also held  meetings  with  the\n\nresidents and  the  Board of  Directors  of the  Condominium  and\n\ndiscussed with  them alternative solutions to the problem.  Thus,\n\nthe residents were given notice of  PRASA's intended action, they\n\nwere informed of how  to resolve the situation and  given several\n\nopportunities to be heard  on the matter.  We do  not see how any\n\nadditional  procedures  could  better  safeguard  the  residents'\n\ninterests so  as to justify the  additional administrative burden\n\nof  such procedures.

Here, we quote only those facts relevant to this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Condominium Bahia-A (hereinafter \"the Condominium\") is a 234-unit housing project which was originally owned and developed by the Corporacion de Renovacion Urbana y Vivienda (\"CRUV\"), a now-defunct public housing agency of the Puerto Rican Government.  On November 11, 1972, CRUV opened an account with the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (\"PRASA\") for water and sewer services for the Condominium.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The PRASA account served all of the units of the Condominium through a single meter.  PRASA thereafter billed and collected from CRUV for water and sewer services provided to the Condominium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1973, ownership of the Condominium was passed to its residents.  A Council of Owners of the Condominium Bahia-A (\"the Council\") was constituted to, among other things, \"administer all phases and aspects\" of the Condominium including \"contract[ing] all necessary services.\"   On February 14, 1973, the Council and the Board of Directors of the Condominium notified Banco de Vivienda, the mortgagor of the property, that they had taken over the administration of the Condominium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[The residents] have alleged that when they purchased their properties from CRUV they were told, as an incentive, that CRUV would continue to pay for all water and sewer services.  CRUV in fact continued to be billed and to pay for these services until October 1, 1981, at which time CRUV requested to [sic] PRASA that it cancel the account for the Condominium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For almost four years after the CRUV account for the Condominium was canceled, PRASA made no effort to collect from the Condominium's residents for water and sewer services provided.  No explanation has been provided for this situation.  On July 12, 1985, PRASA requested in writing that the Condominium, through its Board of Directors, place a bond with PRASA to register an account in its name.  PRASA warned that the failure to register an account could lead to suspension of water services.  On July 22, 1985, the Council answered PRASA's request by refusing to pay for any water and sewer services unless individual meters were installed for each of the apartments.\"  (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">829 F.Supp. at 524-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between September of 1985 and December of 1989, PRASA officials had several meetings with representatives of the Council and at least one meeting with the residents of the Condominium to discuss the situation.  See id. at 525.   PRASA repeatedly \"requested that the Condominium register an account and place the required bond for the water and sewer services.  PRASA proposed a plan whereby the pending debt could be paid in installments.  The residents rejected PRASA's proposals and again insisted on the installation of individual meters, to be paid for by PRASA or CRUV.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 24, 1990, PRASA unilaterally opened an account on behalf of the Condominium and began issuing monthly bills.  The account was not requested by the Condominium and the Condominium did not place a bond with PRASA.  None of these bills were paid or responded to in any fashion by the Condominium.  On April 3, 1991, through a letter personally delivered to Francisca Marrero, the new President of the Board of Directors of the Condominium, PRASA requested a payment in the amount of $448,872.08 for services rendered under the account.  PRASA stated that the failure to pay or submit a proposal for payment would result in the suspension of the water services after 20 days.  A copy of the letter to Marrero was delivered to each unit along with another letter urging the residents to take action to avoid suspension of services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[The residents] have alleged that Marrero requested on several occasions that a meeting be arranged with the Executive Director of PRASA, defendant Maria Margarita Irizarry, to discuss the situation and that her requests were refused.  [The residents] charge that the failure to grant the requests for such a hearing violated their due process rights as established under Puerto Rico law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 24, 1991, 21 days after the delivery of the Marrero letter, water service to the Condominium was suspended.  On May 3, 1991, after the Condominium agreed to place a bond in the amount of $5,000.00 to cover current monthly bills, the service was reinstated.  Two months later, PRASA filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Puerto Rico for the collection of the amounts owed for water and sewer services since 1981.  This complaint was thereafter filed seeking relief based on the allegedly unconstitutional 10-day deprivation of water and sewer services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 525-26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only issue before the district court was \"whether [the residents] suffered a deprivation of their procedural due process rights resulting from PRASA's 10-day suspension of water service to the Condominium Bahia-A.\"  Id. at 527.   The district court stated that \"[t]he procedural due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees citizens with a protected property interest the right to notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to a deprivation of such a property interest by the government\" and that \"[a] threshold issue in this case is whether [the residents] enjoyed a protectable 'property' interest in the water service which was suspended.\"  Id.  The district court indicated that \"if such a property interest does not exist, the due process clause provides no protection.\"  Id.  Finding that \"plaintiffs had no property interest in the continued receipt of water services for which they never contracted,\" the district court dismissed the case.  Id. at 529.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Issues of Material Fact</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The residents first argue that this case presented unresolved issues of material fact, which rendered the district court's grant of summary judgment erroneous.  A fact is \"material\" when it has \"the potential to affect the outcome of the suit under the applicable law.\"  Nereida-Gonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado, 990 F.2d 701, 703 (1st Cir.1993).  While this case may present unresolved issues of fact, we disagree with the residents' contention that these disputes are material to the resolution of this action.  In particular, the residents contend that a determination of whether CRUV owed the residents a contractual duty to pay the water services is material to this dispute.  The residents also contend that the issue of whether the residents were \"clandestine users\" of the water services was an unresolved issue of material fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with the residents' conclusion that these matters are material to the resolution of this dispute.  The existence of any contractual agreement between CRUV and the residents is irrelevant to the issue before us, that is, whether at the time PRASA disconnected the water service, the residents had a protected property interest in the continued receipt of water services.  A determination of whether the residents were \"clandestine users\" is also unnecessary to the resolution of this case as regardless of whether or not they were \"clandestine users,\" they still have not claimed any facts that, if taken as true, would establish that they had a property interest in the continued service of water.  Other allegedly unresolved issues of fact raised by the residents are equally immaterial to this dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Protected Property Interest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The Fourteenth Amendment places procedural constraints on the actions of government that work a deprivation of interests enjoying the stature of 'property' within the meaning of the Due Process Clause.\"  Memphis Light Gas &amp; Water Division v. Craft, 436 U.S. 1, 9, 98 S.Ct. 1554, 1560, 56 L.Ed.2d 30 (1978).  In Board of Regents, the Supreme Court of the United States held that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need for it.  He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.  He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it....  Property interests ... are not created by the Constitution.  Rather they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understanding that stem from an independent source such as state-law rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An interest becomes a protected property interest when recognized by state statute or a legal contract, express or implied, between the state agency and the individual.  Id.  The residents contend that the district court erred in concluding that they \"never entered into a contract with PRASA, for the provision of water and sewer services.\"   They argue that an implied contractual arrangement existed between PRASA and the residents by virtue of PRASA's action of opening an account on behalf of the residents, or in the alternative, as a consequence of the provision of water services by PRASA to plaintiffs for more than 20 years.  Plaintiffs do not cite any provisions of Puerto Rico law nor any cases to support their position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Applying basic principles of contract law, we find their position untenable.  Because Puerto Rico is a civil law jurisdiction we also look to its substantive law to determine whether a different outcome is forthcoming.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming, for purposes of this appeal, that PRASA's action of opening an account and its continued rendition of water services to the residents were valid offers to contract, the residents would still be unable to establish the existence of a contract.  See Farnsworth at 135-136 (\"One who begins to perform services for another in apparent expectation of payment may be taken to be offering to furnish them for reasonable compensation.\").  Under Puerto Rico law, the consent of the contracting parties is an essential element of a contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  P.R.Laws Ann., tit. 31, Sec. 3391.  \"Consent is shown by the concurrence of the offer and acceptance of the thing and the cause which are to constitute the contract.\"   P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 3401.  Hence, an offer standing by itself will not establish the presence of a binding contract.  Gonzalez Rodriguez v. Fumero, 38 P.R.R. 497, 504, 507-08 (1928).  Rather, in order to have a contract, acceptance must be made of that offer.  P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 3401;  see also Jose R. Velez-Torres, Los Contratos at 45-47 (1986).  PRASA repeatedly requested the Condominium to place a bond and to register an account.  PRASA also made it clear to the residents that in order to be considered \"registered users\" with PRASA, they had to apply for water service and place a bond in accordance with the requirements set forth in PRASA's rules and regulations.  The residents refused to do so, thereby rejecting PRASA's offer.  See Velez-Torres at 48-49 (an acceptance should be immediate and definitive, should coincide in all its terms with the offer, and should be made in the manner required by the offerer).  An offeree's inaction or \"silence in the face of the offer to sell goods is not ordinarily an acceptance, because the offeror has no reason to believe from the offeree's silence that the offeree promises to buy.\"   Farnsworth Sec. 3.15, at 155;  see also Velez-Torres at 56-57 (silence ordinarily cannot constitute acceptance of an offer);  Coghlan v. Starkey, 845 F.2d 566, 570 (5th Cir.1988) (neither the mere receipt of water nor the carrying of plaintiff's name on waterworks rolls as user created a contractual relationship, either express or implied, where plaintiff refused to apply for water service).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The residents also argue that the fact that PRASA was having meetings and conversations with the residents in relation to the water and sewer services being rendered evidences an implied contract.  We disagree with plaintiffs' contention that those meetings suggested the existence of such a contract.  These meetings were merely discussions or negotiations regarding who should pay for the installation of individual water meters in the Condominium, whether the residents were required to pay for past services rendered, and conditions for future water service.  See Coghlan at 570 (negotiations over backbill and billing errors alone could not establish the type of property interests required to raise disconnection of water service to a deprivation of a valuable property right).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The residents next contend that the district court erred in concluding that Puerto Rico law did not confer on the residents a property interest in continued water service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We look to Puerto Rico statutes to determine whether Puerto Rico law conferred such a property interest.  See Coghlan, 845 F.2d at 569.   Plaintiffs argue that Section 159 of the Aqueduct and Sewer Act of Puerto Rico, P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 22, Sec. 141 et seq., establishes a property interest in continued water services.  Section 159 authorizes PRASA to establish rules and regulations concerning the use and conservation of water and provides, in relevant part, that the purpose for which PRASA is created is:that the health of the inhabitants of the Island of Puerto Rico shall be attained, that the health of the inhabitants of the Island shall be protected, that the water available shall be utilized in the fullest measure possible and that it shall be made available to the consumers with the greatest possible regularity and continuity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 22, Sec. 159 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The residents contend that they are \"consumers\" within the meaning of Section 159 and as such have a state created property interest in regular and continuous water services.  We need not determine whether Section 159 creates a property interest in consumers because we do not believe that plaintiffs are \"consumers.\"   The Aqueduct and Sewer Act does not define the term \"consumer.\"   Neither do the Regulations issued by PRASA provide a definition of the term.  The residents have not proffered any other authoritative interpretation of the term \"consumer\" which would indicate they were included within the meaning of the word.  We interpret the term \"consumer\" in this context to be limited to persons who pay or otherwise give consideration for goods or services rendered.  We believe this interpretation is consistent with the common understanding of the term.  It is also consistent with a basic tenet of the Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, namely that \"[t]he Authority shall render no free Services.\"   P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 22, Sec. 158.  In the present case, the residents refused to comply with the procedures established by PRASA that would give them consumer status with respect to PRASA.  They refused to register an account, place a bond or pay for water services.  Therefore, they were not \"consumers\" as we interpret that term under Section 159.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, the residents contend that they are \"users\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> of the aqueduct and sewer services, as that term is defined in PRASA regulations and as such, have a property interest in continued services.  The residents have not pointed to any legal authority which indicates that \"users\" have a property interest in water services.  Rather, the residents merely argue that somehow PRASA's regulations defining \"user\" to include \"non-subscriber-users\" and \"clandestine-users\" give them a property interest in water services.  They rely on the regulatory definition of \"Aqueduct Service\" as \"water supply for the benefit of a subscriber or user \" as a basis for this proposition.  Regulation for Administrative-Legal Procedures of the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewer Authority, Chap.  II (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The residents have cited no authority, and we are unable to find any, indicating that regulatory definitions alone are sufficient to establish a property interest.  The relevant case-law is to the contrary and suggests that these regulatory definitions cannot establish a constitutional right to receive water services.  See Coghlan, 845 F.2d at 570 n. 3 (examination of charter creating waterworks and other sub-statutory sources including regulatory statements, for a provision establishing a right to water services is unnecessary and improper);  Gorham v. Hutto, 667 F.2d 1146 (4th Cir.1981) (administrative guidelines are not a sufficient basis for the creation of a due process interest);  Bills v. Henderson, 631 F.2d 1287 (6th Cir.1980) (procedural rules created by state administrative bodies cannot serve as a basis for a separate protected liberty interest);  Sterling v. Maywood, 579 F.2d 1350, 1354 (7th Cir.1978) (where \"plaintiff has neither a contractual nor a statutory basis to support her claim, ... [she] was not deprived of a due process right by defendants [sic] termination of her water service\").  We therefore conclude that the regulatory definitions on which the residents rely do not provide a sufficient basis for finding a property interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even if the residents were able to establish that they had a protected property interest in continued water service, they were not deprived of due process.  The question of what process is due is a question of federal constitutional law.  Cleveland Brd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 541, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1492-93, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985).  Due process generally requires \"that a deprivation of life, liberty, or property be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.\"  Id. at 542, 105 S.Ct. at 1493 (internal citation and quotations omitted).  \"[T]o determine whether a constitutional violation has occurred, it is necessary to ask what process the State provided, and whether it was constitutionally adequate.\"  Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 126, 110 S.Ct. 975, 983-84, 108 L.Ed.2d 100 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we summarize the procedures provided.  In 1986, PRASA began sending the Board of Directors of the Condominium notices warning that failure to place a bond and to register an account on behalf of the Condominium could lead to the suspension of water services.  PRASA officials also met with the Board of Directors and with the residents of the Condominium to discuss the situation and proposed a plan whereby the Condominium could pay the pending debt in installments.  The residents rejected the proposed plan.  In 1990, PRASA unilaterally opened an account on behalf of the Condominium and began issuing monthly bills.  The Condominium neither paid these bills nor responded to them in any fashion.  On April 3, 1991, PRASA delivered a letter to the President of the Board of Directors of the Condominium requesting a payment in the amount of $448,872.08 for services rendered under the account.  PRASA stated that the failure to pay or submit a proposal for payments would result in the suspension of water services after twenty days.  A copy of the letter was delivered to each unit along with another letter urging the residents to take action to avoid the suspension of services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining the adequacy of the procedures afforded the residents we balance the competing interests at stake.  Id.  These are the residents' private interest in continued water service, PRASA's interest in receiving payment for its services and the avoidance of administrative burdens, and the risk of an erroneous deprivation of water services.  See Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976).  The receipt of utility services is a necessity of modern day life and undoubtedly an important interest, however, PRASA's interest in receiving payment for its services is also significant.  It would be unreasonable to expect PRASA to continue providing free services to the residents indefinitely.  PRASA gave the residents notice on several occasions of its intention to discontinue services if the residents did not comply with PRASA's administrative requirements.  PRASA officials also held meetings with the residents and the Board of Directors of the Condominium and discussed with them alternative solutions to the problem.  Thus, the residents were given notice of PRASA's intended action, they were informed of how to resolve the situation and given several opportunities to be heard on the matter.  We do not see how any additional procedures could better safeguard the residents' interests so as to justify the additional administrative burden of such procedures.  We have no doubt that the residents were given more than adequate due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The residents were not entitled to additional procedures set forth in the Puerto Rico Act to Establish Minimum Procedural Requirements for the Suspension of Essential Public Services because this Act affords such protections only to \"subscribers\" of utility services.  See P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 27, Secs. 262b(a), 262b(b), 262b(c), 262b(e), 262b(g) and 262b(h);  see also infra note 2.  By failing to contract with PRASA for the provision of water and sewer services, the residents failed to achieve subscriber status.  The residents' failure to comply with PRASA's administrative requirements prevents them from now claiming an entitlement to PRASA's administrative procedures.  See United States v. Charles George Trucking Co., 823 F.2d 685, 690-91 (1st Cir.1987) (\"A party who is aware of, and chooses to ignore, an available avenue for redress cannot later be allowed to characterize his refusal to travel the road as tantamount to the road being closed--or to no road being in existence\");  Coghlan, 845 F.2d at 569 (there is no support for the proposition that there is a constitutional right to receive utilities when the applicant refuses to comply with reasonable administrative procedures) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.

On November 11, 1972, CRUV opened an account with the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (\"PRASA\") for water and sewer services for the Condominium.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The PRASA account served all of the units of the Condominium through a single meter.  PRASA thereafter billed and collected from CRUV for water and sewer services provided to the Condominium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1973, ownership of the Condominium was passed to its residents.  A Council of Owners of the Condominium Bahia-A (\"the Council\") was constituted to, among other things, \"administer all phases and aspects\" of the Condominium including \"contract[ing] all necessary services.\"   On February 14, 1973, the Council and the Board of Directors of the Condominium notified Banco de Vivienda, the mortgagor of the property, that they had taken over the administration of the Condominium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[The residents] have alleged that when they purchased their properties from CRUV they were told, as an incentive, that CRUV would continue to pay for all water and sewer services.  CRUV in fact continued to be billed and to pay for these services until October 1, 1981, at which time CRUV requested to [sic] PRASA that it cancel the account for the Condominium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For almost four years after the CRUV account for the Condominium was canceled, PRASA made no effort to collect from the Condominium's residents for water and sewer services provided.  No explanation has been provided for this situation.  On July 12, 1985, PRASA requested in writing that the Condominium, through its Board of Directors, place a bond with PRASA to register an account in its name.  PRASA warned that the failure to register an account could lead to suspension of water services.  On July 22, 1985, the Council answered PRASA's request by refusing to pay for any water and sewer services unless individual meters were installed for each of the apartments.\"  (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">829 F.Supp. at 524-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between September of 1985 and December of 1989, PRASA officials had several meetings with representatives of the Council and at least one meeting with the residents of the Condominium to discuss the situation.

The account was not requested by the Condominium and the Condominium did not place a bond with PRASA.  None of these bills were paid or responded to in any fashion by the Condominium.  On April 3, 1991, through a letter personally delivered to Francisca Marrero, the new President of the Board of Directors of the Condominium, PRASA requested a payment in the amount of $448,872.08 for services rendered under the account.  PRASA stated that the failure to pay or submit a proposal for payment would result in the suspension of the water services after 20 days.  A copy of the letter to Marrero was delivered to each unit along with another letter urging the residents to take action to avoid suspension of services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[The residents] have alleged that Marrero requested on several occasions that a meeting be arranged with the Executive Director of PRASA, defendant Maria Margarita Irizarry, to discuss the situation and that her requests were refused.

Two months later, PRASA filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Puerto Rico for the collection of the amounts owed for water and sewer services since 1981.

Issues of Material Fact</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The residents first argue that this case presented unresolved issues of material fact, which rendered the district court's grant of summary judgment erroneous.  A fact is \"material\" when it has \"the potential to affect the outcome of the suit under the applicable law.\"  Nereida-Gonzalez v.

While this case may present unresolved issues of fact, we disagree with the residents' contention that these disputes are material to the resolution of this action.  In particular, the residents contend that a determination of whether CRUV owed the residents a contractual duty to pay the water services is material to this dispute.  The residents also contend that the issue of whether the residents were \"clandestine users\" of the water services was an unresolved issue of material fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with the residents' conclusion that these matters are material to the resolution of this dispute.  The existence of any contractual agreement between CRUV and the residents is irrelevant to the issue before us, that is, whether at the time PRASA disconnected the water service, the residents had a protected property interest in the continued receipt of water services.  A determination of whether the residents were \"clandestine users\" is also unnecessary to the resolution of this case as regardless of whether or not they were \"clandestine users,\" they still have not claimed any facts that, if taken as true, would establish that they had a property interest in the continued service of water.

Under Puerto Rico law, the consent of the contracting parties is an essential element of a contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  P.R.Laws Ann., tit. 31, Sec. 3391.  \"Consent is shown by the concurrence of the offer and acceptance of the thing and the cause which are to constitute the contract.\"   P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 3401.  Hence, an offer standing by itself will not establish the presence of a binding contract.  Gonzalez Rodriguez v. Fumero, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></span>, 504, 507-08 (1928).  Rather, in order to have a contract, acceptance must be made of that offer.  P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 3401;  see also Jose R. Velez-Torres, Los Contratos at 45-47 (1986).  PRASA repeatedly requested the Condominium to place a bond and to register an account.  PRASA also made it clear to the residents that in order to be considered \"registered users\" with PRASA, they had to apply for water service and place a bond in accordance with the requirements set forth in PRASA's rules and regulations.  The residents refused to do so, thereby rejecting PRASA's offer.  See Velez-Torres at 48-49 (an acceptance should be immediate and definitive, should coincide in all its terms with the offer, and should be made in the manner required by the offerer).  An offeree's inaction or \"silence in the face of the offer to sell goods is not ordinarily an acceptance, because the offeror has no reason to believe from the offeree's silence that the offeree promises to buy.\"   Farnsworth Sec. 3.15, at 155;  see also Velez-Torres at 56-57 (silence ordinarily cannot constitute acceptance of an offer);  Coghlan v. Starkey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504889\"><a href=\"/opinion/504889/ann-coghlan-v-donald-starkey-emmett-perrilloux-anthony-s-arnone/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span>, 570 (5th Cir.1988) (neither the mere receipt of water nor the carrying of plaintiff's name on waterworks rolls as user created a contractual relationship, either express or implied, where plaintiff refused to apply for water service).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The residents also argue that the fact that PRASA was having meetings and conversations with the residents in relation to the water and sewer services being rendered evidences an implied contract.  We disagree with plaintiffs' contention that those meetings suggested the existence of such a contract.  These meetings were merely discussions or negotiations regarding who should pay for the installation of individual water meters in the Condominium, whether the residents were required to pay for past services rendered, and conditions for future water service.  See Coghlan at 570 (negotiations over backbill and billing errors alone could not establish the type of property interests required to raise disconnection of water service to a deprivation of a valuable property right).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The residents next contend that the district court erred in concluding that Puerto Rico law did not confer on the residents a property interest in continued water service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We look to Puerto Rico statutes to determine whether Puerto Rico law conferred such a property interest.

Plaintiffs argue that Section 159 of the Aqueduct and Sewer Act of Puerto Rico, P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 22, Sec. 141 et seq., establishes a property interest in continued water services.  Section 159 authorizes PRASA to establish rules and regulations concerning the use and conservation of water and provides, in relevant part, that the purpose for which PRASA is created is:that the health of the inhabitants of the Island of Puerto Rico shall be attained, that the health of the inhabitants of the Island shall be protected, that the water available shall be utilized in the fullest measure possible and that it shall be made available to the consumers with the greatest possible regularity and continuity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 22, Sec. 159 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The residents contend that they are \"consumers\" within the meaning of Section 159 and as such have a state created property interest in regular and continuous water services.  We need not determine whether Section 159 creates a property interest in consumers because we do not believe that plaintiffs are \"consumers.\"   The Aqueduct and Sewer Act does not define the term \"consumer.\"   Neither do the Regulations issued by PRASA provide a definition of the term.  The residents have not proffered any other authoritative interpretation of the term \"consumer\" which would indicate they were included within the meaning of the word.  We interpret the term \"consumer\" in this context to be limited to persons who pay or otherwise give consideration for goods or services rendered.  We believe this interpretation is consistent with the common understanding of the term.  It is also consistent with a basic tenet of the Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, namely that \"[t]he Authority shall render no free Services.\"   P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 22, Sec. 158.  In the present case, the residents refused to comply with the procedures established by PRASA that would give them consumer status with respect to PRASA.  They refused to register an account, place a bond or pay for water services.  Therefore, they were not \"consumers\" as we interpret that term under Section 159.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, the residents contend that they are \"users\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> of the aqueduct and sewer services, as that term is defined in PRASA regulations and as such, have a property interest in continued services.  The residents have not pointed to any legal authority which indicates that \"users\" have a property interest in water services.  Rather, the residents merely argue that somehow PRASA's regulations defining \"user\" to include \"non-subscriber-users\" and \"clandestine-users\" give them a property interest in water services.  They rely on the regulatory definition of \"Aqueduct Service\" as \"water supply for the benefit of a subscriber or user \" as a basis for this proposition.

In 1986, PRASA began sending the Board of Directors of the Condominium notices warning that failure to place a bond and to register an account on behalf of the Condominium could lead to the suspension of water services.  PRASA officials also met with the Board of Directors and with the residents of the Condominium to discuss the situation and proposed a plan whereby the Condominium could pay the pending debt in installments.  The residents rejected the proposed plan.  In 1990, PRASA unilaterally opened an account on behalf of the Condominium and began issuing monthly bills.  The Condominium neither paid these bills nor responded to them in any fashion.  On April 3, 1991, PRASA delivered a letter to the President of the Board of Directors of the Condominium requesting a payment in the amount of $448,872.08 for services rendered under the account.  PRASA stated that the failure to pay or submit a proposal for payments would result in the suspension of water services after twenty days.  A copy of the letter was delivered to each unit along with another letter urging the residents to take action to avoid the suspension of services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining the adequacy of the procedures afforded the residents we balance the competing interests at stake.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620710\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620710/zinermon-v-burch/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  These are </a></span>the residents' private interest in continued water service, PRASA's interest in receiving payment for its services and the avoidance of administrative burdens, and the risk of an erroneous deprivation of water services.  See Mathews v. Eldridge, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 335, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">893</span></a></span>, 903, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span> </a></span>(1976).  The receipt of utility services is a necessity of modern day life and undoubtedly an important interest, however, PRASA's interest in receiving payment for its services is also significant.  It would be unreasonable to expect PRASA to continue providing free services to the residents indefinitely.  PRASA gave the residents notice on several occasions of its intention to discontinue services if the residents did not comply with PRASA's administrative requirements.  PRASA officials also held meetings with the residents and the Board of Directors of the Condominium and discussed with them alternative solutions to the problem.  Thus, the residents were given notice of PRASA's intended action, they were informed of how to resolve the situation and given several opportunities to be heard on the matter.  We do not see how any additional procedures could better safeguard the residents' interests so as to justify the additional administrative burden of such procedures.  We have no doubt that the residents were given more than adequate due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The residents were not entitled to additional procedures set forth in the Puerto Rico Act to Establish Minimum Procedural Requirements for the Suspension of Essential Public Services because this Act affords such protections only to \"subscribers\" of utility services.  See P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 27, Secs. 262b(a), 262b(b), 262b(c), 262b(e), 262b(g) and 262b(h);  see also infra note 2.  By failing to contract with PRASA for the provision of water and sewer services, the residents failed to achieve subscriber status.  The residents' failure to comply with PRASA's administrative requirements prevents them from now claiming an entitlement to PRASA's administrative procedures.  See United States v.
