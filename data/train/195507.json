We decide  today a question  of\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\nfirst  impression:   Do principles  of sovereign  immunity bar  a\n\nfederal district court,  exercising its  supervisory power,  from\n\nassessing   attorneys'  fees  and   costs  against   the  federal\n\ngovernment  in  a  criminal  case?    We   answer  this  question\n\naffirmatively and,  therefore, annul  the  district court's  fee-\n\nshifting orders.\n\nI.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n          This  appeal  arises  out  of  unpardonable  misconduct\n\ncommitted by  a federal prosecutor who should  have known better.\n\nThe  factual  background  of  the  criminal  case  in  which  the\n\nmisconduct occurred    a multi-defendant  prosecution for,  inter\n                                                                 \n\nalia,   conspiracy  to  defraud  a  federally  insured  financial\n    \n\ninstitution    is memorialized in a recent opinion of this court.\n\nSee United States v.  Lacroix,     F.3d    ,      (1st Cir. 1994)\n                             \n\n[No. 93-1845,  slip op.  at 2-4].   The  facts pertaining  to the\n\nmisconduct are recounted in the opinion below.  See United States\n                                                                 \n\nv.  Horn, 811  F. Supp. 739,  741-44, 748-51 (D.N.H.  1992).  For\n        \n\npurposes of deciding the abstract question of law that  confronts\n\nus today, we largely omit  the former set of facts, and  limn the\n\nlatter in less than exegetic detail.\n\n          In mid-1992, a federal  grand jury returned a 102-count\n\nindictment  against seven  individuals  allegedly  involved in  a\n\nconspiracy  to  market  and   sell  newly  constructed  homes  by\n\nfraudulent means.  The indictment charged violations of 18 U.S.C.\n\n    2371, 1014 and 1344.  The prosecutors who controlled the case\n\n                                2\n\nwere members of the Justice Department's \"New England Bank  Fraud\n\nTask  Force,\" so  called.   The  defendants,  none of  whom  were\n\nindigent, obtained counsel at their own expense.\n\n          During pretrial proceedings,  the government made  more\n\nthan  10,000 documents  available  for inspection  at the  Boston\n\noffice of Aspen Systems,  an independent document management firm\n\nretained  by the  Task Force.   On November 9,  1992, an attorney\n\nrepresenting defendants Matthew Zsofka,  John Lee, and Evangelist\n\nLacroix visited the document repository to search for papers that\n\nmight prove helpful in cross-examination.  A government paralegal\n\nvolunteered to have a member  of Aspen's clerical staff photocopy\n\nany document that caught the lawyer's eye.  The attorney accepted\n\nthe  offer.  When the paralegal mentioned this undertaking to the\n\nlead  prosecutor, she was  instructed to have  the Aspen employee\n\nmake an  extra copy  of each  defense-selected  document for  the\n\ngovernment's edification.   Defense  counsel was not  informed of\n\nthis added flourish.\n\n          To paraphrase the Scottish poet, the  best-laid schemes\n\nof mice  and prosecutors often go  awry.  Cf. Robert  Burns, To a\n                                                                 \n\nMouse (1785).   When the  photocopying of desired  documents took\n     \n\nlonger  than seemed  reasonable, the  defense attorney  smelled a\n\nrat.    A  cursory   investigation  uncovered  the  prosecution's\n\nexperiment  in  duplicitous  duplication.   The  lawyer  promptly\n\ndemanded that  the government  return its  copies  of the  papers\n\nculled by the  defense.  When  his demand fell  on deaf ears,  he\n\nimmediately drafted a motion  to seal, filed the motion  with the\n\n                                3\n\ndistrict court, and servedit before theclose of business thatday.\n\n          At this  delicate juncture, the lead  prosecutor poured\n\nkerosene  on a raging  fire.1   She did  not passively  await the\n\ncourt's ruling on the motion, but, instead, during the three days\n\nthat  elapsed before the district  court took up  the motion, the\n\nprosecutor  reviewed  the  surreptitiously duplicated  documents,\n\ndiscussed  them  with two  of her  subalterns,  and used  them to\n\nprepare  a key prosecution witness  (in the presence  of a second\n\npossible  witness).  Thus, by  November 13, 1992,  when the court\n\ngranted  the motion  to seal and  explicitly instructed  the lead\n\nprosecutor not to make  further use of the papers singled  out by\n\nthe  defense   or  take  further  advantage   of  the  situation,\n\nappreciable damage already had been done.\n\n          The lead  prosecutor then  made a bad  situation worse.\n\nTwo  pages mysteriously  disappeared from  the lead  prosecutor's\n\ncache of ill-gotten documents before the set was submitted to the\n\ndistrict  court for  sealing.   And  in  direct defiance  of  the\n\ncourt's order,  the lead prosecutor  prepared a complete  new set\n\nfor her own  use.  Adding  insult to injury,  she next signed  an\n\naffidavit of  somewhat questionable veracity.   Finally, when she\n\nappeared before  the district court  to discuss the  bizarre game\n\n                    \n\n     1The district court made a  deliberate decision to spare the\nlead prosecutor  public humiliation and revised  its order before\npublication  to  delete any  mention  of  the prosecutor's  name.\nAlthough  we, if  writing on  a pristine  page, might  not  be so\nsolicitous,  we  honor  the  district  court's  exercise  of  its\ndiscretion, mindful that its choice has substantive implications.\nCf.  United States  v.  Hasting, 461  U.S.  499, 506  n.5  (1983)\n                               \n(listing public chastisement of  errant attorney as a permissible\nform of sanction for misconduct).\n\n                                4\n\nshe  had  been  playing,  she  made  a  series  of   inconsistent\n\nstatements evincing what  the court charitably called  a \"lack of\n\ncandor.\"  Horn, 811 F. Supp. at 749, 750 n.4.\n              \n\n          From  the outset, defendants  Zsofka, Lee,  and Lacroix\n\nhad mounted a cooperative defense.   Thus, the three of them were\n\nequally  vulnerable  to  the   misconduct  that  occurred.    Not\n\nsurprisingly, the trio moved to dismiss the case on the ground of\n\nprosecutorial  misconduct.2     The  government  objected.     In\n\nevaluating the  motions, the lower  court ruled that  the current\n\nselection  during the  discovery phase of  a pending  case offers\n\ninsight  into  counsel's  thoughts,  and,  therefore, constitutes\n\nprivileged  work product.   See id. at  745-47 (citing In  re San\n                                                                 \n\nJuan  Dupont Plaza  Hotel Fire  Litig., 859  F.2d 1007  (1st Cir.\n                                      \n\n1988)).    After rejecting  the  government's  argument that  the\n\nprivilege  had been  waived, the  court determined that  the lead\n\nprosecutor,  by furtively  copying and  thereafter reviewing  the\n\nselected  documents, crossed the ethical line.  The court further\n\nruled that  this prosecutorial  misconduct not only  violated the\n\ndefendants' work-product privilege, but also abridged their Fifth\n\nAmendment right to due process and their Sixth Amendment right to\n\n                    \n\n     2For ease  in reference,  we call Zsofka,  Lee, and  Lacroix\n\"the  appellees.\"   Withal,  we  note  that  the  district  court\npermitted three  other defendants    Richard Horn,  Patrick Dion,\nand Patricia  Dion   to join  in the request for  dismissal.  See\n                                                                 \nHorn,  811 F. Supp. at 744-45.   Though they had no connection to\n    \nthe duped attorney,  these three  defendants ultimately  received\nmodest fee  awards.  Notwithstanding, their  monetary interest in\nthis  appeal,  they  eschewed  the filing  of  appellate  briefs.\nConsequently,  we make  no  further reference  to  them or  to  a\nseventh  defendant,  Susan  Yildiz,   who  entered  into  a  plea\nagreement before the misconduct occurred.\n\n                                5\n\neffective assistance of counsel.  See id. at 747-52.\n                                         \n\n          Finding prejudice, but  not a stain so  indelible as to\n\njustify  dismissing the  indictment,  see id.  at 751,  the court\n                                             \n\nstitched  together  a  serviceable  fabric  of narrowly  tailored\n\nremedies, see id. at 751-52.  The court ordered the government to\n                 \n\nprovide the  defense with  summaries of its  witnesses' testimony\n\nand lists of its exhibits;  permit the defense to depose  the two\n\npotential  witnesses   who  had  been  exposed   to  the  bootleg\n\ndocuments; refrain  from referring at  trial to the  substance of\n\nthe  documents  except in  response  to  defense references;  and\n\nremove  the  lead prosecutor  from  the case.   See  id.  at 752.\n                                                        \n\nAdditionally,  the  court referred  the  lead  prosecutor to  the\n\ndisciplinary committees of  her two bar associations, and, in the\n\nportion  of its order  that sparked the  current controversy, the\n\ncourt  directed the government to pay the fees and costs incurred\n\nby  the defendants in litigating  the misconduct issue.   See id.\n                                                                 \n\nAlthough the court's original order was inexplicit concerning the\n\nsource of its authority to  assess fees and costs, the  court, in\n\ndenying the government's motion  to reconsider, explained that it\n\ngrounded this sanction in the judiciary's supervisory power.  See\n                                                                 \n\nid. at 753-54.\n   \n\n          Zsofka,  Lee, and  Lacroix stood  trial early  in 1993.\n\nThey  were each  convicted  on  at  least  one  count,  and  were\n\nsentenced  in  July.3   On August  18,  1993, the  district court\n\n                    \n\n     3The  other four  defendants pled  guilty at  various times.\nThey were all sentenced in May of 1993.\n\n                                6\n\nquantified  its  earlier  order,   assessing  a  grand  total  of\n\n$46,477.80  in fees  and costs.   The  other sanctions  have been\n\ncarried out and the defense no longer presses  the claim that the\n\ndistrict court should  have dismissed the indictment.  Hence, all\n\nthat  remains of  the case  is the  government's appeal  from the\n\nassessment of fees.\n\n          The government contests the award chiefly on the ground\n\nthat  it  is prohibited  by  principles  of sovereign  immunity.4\n\nExtracted  from its  complicated  factual  predicate, drained  of\n\nrancor,   and  separated   from  other,   essentially  extraneous\n\ndisputes, this appeal requires us to serve as the dispatcher at a\n\ncrossing where two powerful engines   the judiciary's supervisory\n\npower  and  the  government's  sovereign  immunity     are  on  a\n\ncollision course.\n\nII.  DOCTRINAL BACKGROUND\n\n          In  ascertaining what  happens  when  doctrines  clash,\n\nderivation frequently becomes  important.  Thus, we turn  to this\n\ntask.\n\n                      A.  Supervisory Power.\n                                           \n\n          Supervisory  power, sometimes known  as inherent power,\n\nencompasses those powers which, though \"not specifically required\n\nby  the Constitution or the  Congress,\" United States v. Hasting,\n                                                                \n\n                    \n\n     4The  government  also  maintains  that it  could  not  have\nviolated  any  applicable work-product  privilege, and  cannot be\npenalized  for so  doing,  because the  defense  waived any  such\nprivilege by making voluntary  disclosures to a government agent,\nnamely,  the  Aspen office  worker.   Because  we agree  that the\ngovernment is shielded  from the monetary award by  principles of\nsovereign immunity, we take no view of this asseveration.\n\n                                7\n\n461  U.S.  499, 505  (1983),  are nonetheless  \"necessary  to the\n\nexercise of all others,\" Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n752,  764 (1980)  (quoting United  States v.

Santana,\n                                                                \n\n6 F.3d 1, 9-10 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          Although the  doctrine's ancestry can be  traced to the\n\nearly days of the Republic, see, e.g., Hudson, 11 U.S. at 34; see\n                                                                 \n\nalso  Ex parte  Robinson,  86 U.S.  (19  Wall.) 505,  510  (1873)\n                        \n\n(observing  that the \"moment the courts of the United States were\n\ncalled into existence .  . . they became possessed  of [inherent]\n\npower\"),  a full-scale  genealogical  dig would  serve no  useful\n\npurpose.  It suffices to say that the doctrine emerged in  modern\n\nform roughly a half-century ago, see McNabb v. United States, 318\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 332, 341 (1943), and it has since developed most robustly in\n\nthe area of criminal procedure, see Sara Sun Beale, Reconsidering\n                                                                 \n\nSupervisory  Power  in Criminal  Cases, 84  Colum.

For one thing,  the supervisory power\n       \n\ndoctrine is interstitial in  the sense that it applies  only when\n\nthere is no  effective alternative provided by rule,  statute, or\n\nconstitutional clause.   See Chambers,  501 U.S. at  50-51.

In this  connection, we note\nthat, although some courts of appeals have attempted to subdivide\nthe  supervisory  power  into  three categories  ranged  along  a\ncontinuum   according   to  their   degree  of   necessity,  and,\nconcomitantly,  the  extent  to  which they  may  be  subject  to\ncongressional limitation, see In  re Stone, 986 F.2d  898, 901-03\n                                          \n(5th Cir. 1993); Eash, 757 F.2d at 562-63, the Supreme  Court has\n                     \nexpressly declined to adopt this taxonomy, see Chambers, 501 U.S.\n                                                       \nat 48 n.12.\n\n                                9\n\ndemocratic  controls,\"  Roadway Express,  447  U.S.  at 764,  and\n                                       \n\n\"[b]ecause of their very potency,\" Chambers, 501 U.S. at 44.\n                                           \n\n          In  particular,  it  is  inappropriate  for  courts  to\n\nattempt to use the supervisory power to justify an extreme remedy\n\nwhen, short  of such heroic  measures, the  means are at  hand to\n\nconstruct a  satisfactory anodyne  more narrowly tailored  to the\n\nobjective.

Sovereign Immunity.\n                                           \n\n          The principle  of  sovereign immunity,  in its  primary\n\nform, dictates that the United States may not be sued except with\n\nits  consent.  This tenet was first  stated, ipse dixit, by Chief\n                                                       \n\nJustice Marshall in Cohens  v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6  Wheat.) 264,\n                                       \n\n411-12  (1821) (dictum).  It  has been reaffirmed  as recently as\n\nthis past term.  See FDIC v. Meyer, 114 S. Ct.  996, 1000 (1994);\n                                  \n\nsee also Gonsalves v.

Hooe, 7  U.S. (3  Cranch) 73,  90-91\n                                 \n\n(1805).   However, the Hooe  Court made no  explicit reference to\n                           \n\nsovereign  immunity, and it was not until four decades later that\n\nthe  two  principles formally  converged,  see  United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nMcLemore,  45 U.S. (4 How.)  286, 287-88 (1846).   They have been\n        \n\n                                11\n\ntaken in tandem ever since in cases involving costs.  See,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited States v.

Sierra Club, 463 U.S. 680,\n                                                  \n\n685 (1983)  (holding that, waiver aside,  sovereign immunity bars\n\nthe shifting  of attorneys' fees against  the federal government)\n\n(citing Alyeska Pipeline Serv.

Since then,  the proposition  that\n\nsovereign  immunity  bars the  recovery  of  attorneys' fees  has\n\nbecome  ensconced at the circuit level.

After  all, Congress would not have felt impelled to\nenact the many statutes waiving  immunity to attorneys' fees, see\n                                                                 \n1 Mary Frances Derfner &amp; Arthur D.

Viewed against this austere backdrop, we think\n\nit  is fair to say  that, by common  understanding, the secondary\n\nprinciple of sovereign immunity operates on the broadest possible\n\nlevel:  it stands as an obstacle to virtually all direct assaults\n\nagainst  the public fisc, save only those incursions from time to\n\ntime authorized by Congress.\n\n          Those  who  seek  a  deep understanding  of  the  law's\n\nprofundities are likely to  find sovereign immunity a frustrating\n\ntopic, for, from the very beginning, sovereign immunity has  been\n\n\"accepted as  a point  of departure unquestioned,\"  Cunningham v.\n                                                              \n\nMacon &amp; Brunswick R.R., 109 U.S. 446, 451 (1883), or, put another\n                      \n\nway,  simply taken at face  value and \"treated  as an established\n\ndoctrine,\"  United  States  v.  Lee, 106  U.S.  196,  207 (1882).\n                                   \n\nAlthough  we know relatively little, we do know that the doctrine\n\nderives from the  common law  tradition that the  king should  be\n\ninsulated  from suit  absent his  consent.   See,  e.g., Fairmont\n                                                                 \n\nCreamery, 275 U.S. at 73; see  also Chisolm v.

To  be  sure,  this  tradition\n\ncould not be  transplanted root  and branch into  a system  where\n\nsovereignty  was diffused  both  vertically  (by federalism)  and\n\nhorizontally  (by the  separation  of powers).   Accordingly,  in\n\nregard to the federal government, the law adapted the doctrine in\n\nsuch a way that  Congress inherited the king's sovereign  role of\n\ngranting  consent  to  be sued.    See  Chisolm,  2 U.S.  at  436\n                                               \n\n                                13\n\n(Iredell, J., dissenting).  One consequence of this adaptation is\n\nthat  executive officers  lack  the power  to  waive the  federal\n\ngovernment's sovereign immunity.  See United States v.  Shaw, 309\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 495,  501 (1940); Munro  v.

Some  judges have\n\ntheorized that  it  is necessary  to  protect the  operations  of\n\ngovernment from  undue interference and  financial embarrassment.\n\nSee,  e.g., Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n682, 704 (1949); Lee, 106 U.S. at 226 (Gray, J., dissenting); The\n                                                                 \n\nSiren, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 152, 154 (1868).  Other judges, taking a\n     \n\nmore positivist view  of law,  have suggested that  the right  to\n\nrecover against the government cannot exist unless the government\n\nitself  deigns to create such  a right.7   See, e.g., Kawananakoa\n                                                                 \n\nv.

First, a\n\nwaiver of sovereign immunity must be definitely and unequivocally\n\nexpressed.   See  United States  v. Mitchell,  445 U.S.  535, 538\n                                            \n\n(1980); In re Perry, 882 F.2d at 544.  The Court has gone  so far\n                   \n\nas  to suggest that the unequivocal expression must appear in the\n\ntext of the statute itself.  See United States v. Nordic Village,\n                                                                 \n\nInc., 112 S. Ct. 1011, 1016  (1992); Ardestani v. INS, 112 S.

Second, a waiver of sovereign  immunity always\n\nis to be construed  strictly in favor of the  federal government,\n\nand must not be  enlarged beyond such boundaries as  its language\n\nplainly requires.   See Nordic  Village, 112 S.

See Coleman\n                                                                 \n\nv.

ANALYSIS\n\n          In this  case, the doctrines of  sovereign immunity and\n\nsupervisory  power, each  formidable  in its  own  right, are  in\n\nunavoidable  tension.11  Despite the fact  that, in recent years,\n\n                    \n\n     10Although  the  district  court  in  Woodley  shifted  fees\n                                                  \nagainst the  government partially in reliance  on its supervisory\npower, the  Ninth Circuit overturned the fee  award, reasoning on\nthis issue that the availability of other sanctions precluded the\ncourt from unleashing its supervisory power.  See Woodley, 9 F.3d\n                                                         \nat  781-82.   The  ensuing dictum  to  the effect  that sovereign\nimmunity does  not bar fee-shifting under  the supervisory power,\nsee id. at 782, is both gratuitous and unsupported.\n       \n          Our  research  has  also unearthed  an  occasional near\nmiss.   For example, in Andrulonis v. United States, 724 F. Supp.\n                                                   \n1421, 1537 (N.D.N.Y. 1989), aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other\n                                                                 \ngrounds,  924 F.2d 1210 (2d Cir. 1991), vacated on other grounds,\n                                                                \n112  S. Ct. 39  (1992), the court granted  a motion for sanctions\nagainst  the federal government made  under Rule 11,  28 U.S.C.  \n1926,  and the  court's inherent  powers, without  specifying the\nsource  for  the sanction  imposed.   See  also United  States v.\n                                                              \nPrince, 1994  U.S.  Dist. LEXIS  2962  at *1-*4  (E.D.N.Y.  1994)\n      \n(withdrawing  assessment of  jury costs  against U.S.  Attorney's\nOffice under court's supervisory  power, in the face of  a motion\nfor  reconsideration  arguing  constraints  imposed  by sovereign\nimmunity).\n\n     11We see no  way to avoid this tension by  upholding the fee\naward  on  an alternative  ground.    While government  counsel's\ndisobedience  and deception of the court  perhaps could have been\npunished under the  contempt statute,  18 U.S.C.    401, and  the\nentire  fiasco, if conceived as  a discovery violation within the\n\n                                18\n\nthe domain of sovereign  immunity has tended to contract  and the\n\ndomain of supervisory power has tended to expand, we believe that\n\nsovereign immunity  ordinarily will trump supervisory  power in a\n\nhead-to-head confrontation.  The critical determinant is that the\n\ndoctrines are of fundamentally different character:   supervisory\n\npowers are  discretionary and carefully  circumscribed; sovereign\n\nimmunity is  mandatory and  absolute.  Consequently,  whereas the\n\nformer  may be invoked in  the absence of  an applicable statute,\n           \n\nthe  latter must  be  invoked in  the  absence of  an  applicable\n                \n\nstatute; and  whereas the  former may be  tempered by a  court to\n                                     \n\nimpose  certain remedial  measures  and to  withhold others,  the\n\nlatter must be  applied mechanically,  come what may.   In  other\n           \n\nwords, unlike the  doctrine of supervisory power, the doctrine of\n\nsovereign  immunity proceeds by fiat:  if Congress has not waived\n\nthe  sovereign's immunity  in  a given  context,  the courts  are\n\nobliged to honor that immunity.  See, e.g., Meyer, 114  S. Ct. at\n                                                 \n\n                    \n\nambit  of Fed. R. Crim.  P. 16(b)(2), might  have been punishable\nunder the broadly worded  sanction authority of Fed. R.  Crim. P.\n16(d)(2), these possibilities afford no hope of  averting a head-\non collision  between judicial power and sovereign  immunity.  In\nthe first place, the district court's order made it pellucid that\nsupervisory  power comprised  the  sole foundation  on which  the\nmonetary sanction rested.  See Horn, 811 F. Supp. at  753-54.  We\n                                   \nwill  not go behind such  a determination and  speculate what the\ncourt  might (or  might  not)  have  done  had  it  analyzed  the\nprosecutor's  misconduct under  a different  standard.   See R.W.\n                                                                 \nInt'l  Corp. v.  Welch  Foods, Inc.,  937 F.2d  11, 19  (1st Cir.\n                                   \n1991).  In  the second  place, neither section  401 nor  Criminal\nRule 16  offer a  vehicle  powerful enough  to overrun  sovereign\nimmunity.  See Woodley,  9 F.3d at 781-82  (holding that Fed.  R.\n                      \nCrim. P. 16 does not work  a waiver of sovereign immunity); Espy,\n                                                                \n986  F.2d at 1191 (holding that  18 U.S.C.   401  does not work a\nwaiver  of  sovereign immunity).    Thus,  dressing the  district\ncourt's decision  in different, less  confrontational garb  would\nnot sidestep the imminent doctrinal clash.\n\n                                19\n\n1000.\n\n          The government tells  us that this is  precisely such a\n\ncase:  since Congress has not acted, the government's immunity to\n\nfee awards in criminal cases remains intact.  At first blush, the\n\nconclusion  seems sound.    We are  able  to discern  only  three\n\navenues  by which  appellees arguably  might tip-toe  around this\n\nresult.  We trace each of these routes.\n\n          The most obvious detour around the barrier presented by\n\nsovereign immunity depends on waiver.   If appellees can identify\n\nsome statute or rule,  and show that Congress thereby  lifted the\n\nfederal  government's  sovereign  immunity  in   this  particular\n\ncontext, they would  have an unobstructed path.   But there is no\n\nsuch  statute or rule applicable  here   and  appellees, to their\n\ncredit, do not pretend that one exists.\n\n          The  second detour  embodies  the  assumption that,  in\n\nappropriate  cases, the  judiciary possesses  the naked  power to\n\noverride  sovereign immunity.  We  believe that this  avenue is a\n\ndead end.   One of the main purposes of  sovereign immunity is to\n\nguard against  judicial interference in  executive functions, see\n                                                                 \n\nLarson, 337 U.S.  at 704, and  the notion of a  judicial override\n      \n\noperating ex proprio vigore would largely frustrate this purpose.\n                           \n\nIn  any event,  the proposed  detour runs  headlong into  a stone\n\nwall:  Congress, not the  courts, is the government's  authorized\n\nrepresentative for  purposes of waiving sovereign  immunity.  See\n                                                                 \n\nsupra p.13 and cases cited; see also Hans  v. Louisiana, 134 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n1, 21 (1890) (declaring that, because the \"legislative department\n\n                                20\n\nof a State represents its polity and its will,\" \"the legislature,\n\nand  not the  courts, is  the judge\"  of when  sovereign immunity\n\nought be waived).\n\n          A  third possible route around  the barrier is to argue\n\nthat,  for whatever  reason,  the federal  government's sovereign\n\nimmunity does  not extend to monetary sanctions, such as punitive\n\nfee awards, levied under a court's supervisory power.  It is this\n\navenue  that  appellees  most   vigorously  explore.    Shorn  of\n\nrhetoric,  they assert  three  basic reasons  why  the shield  of\n\nimmunity does not  cover such situations.  We mull each reason in\n\nturn.\n\n          1.   Reward v. Punishment.   Appellees assert that, for\n          1.   Reward v. Punishment.\n                                   \n\npurposes  of  sovereign   immunity,  the  law   historically  has\n\nprecluded  fee-shifting only when it  is employed as  a reward to\n\nprevailing  parties and not when  it is employed  as a punishment\n\nfor  litigation abuse.   This  foray suggests  that what  we have\n\ncalled  the secondary principle of sovereign immunity   the tenet\n\nholding  that  the government  is  immune  to monetary  penalties\n\nimposed  in court  cases   precludes  fee-shifting only  when the\n\nshifted fees are intended  to reward a prevailing party,  and not\n\nwhen they are meant to reprimand a misbehaving party.\n\n          Appellees starts out  on solid ground in the sense that\n\nthe older  cases discussing the secondary  principle of sovereign\n\nimmunity  all  involved  monetary  awards to  prevailing  parties\n\ndirectly attributable to litigatory success.  See, e.g., Fairmont\n                                                                 \n\nCreamery, 275 U.S. at 73-74; McLemore, 45 U.S. at 288.

Apart from a\n\nstatute or rule so providing, counsel fees cannot be shifted as a\n\nreward  to a  prevailing party  in any  case, civil  or criminal,\n\nwhether  or not the  government is the  fee target.   See Alyeska\n                                                                 \n\nPipeline, 421 U.S.  at 247 (limning \"American rule\"). Taking into\n        \n\naccount  the ground  rules  of  American  litigation,  appellees'\n\nargument  must  mean  that  sovereign immunity  bars  fee  awards\n\nagainst  the government only when  the fees are  assessed under a\n\n                    \n\n     12At  early common  law,  costs were  awarded to  prevailing\nparties  as a  matter of  course  in all  cases.   See Arthur  L.\n                                                      \nGoodhart, Costs, 38  Yale L.J.  849, 851-53 (1929).   Before  the\n               \nadoption of  the Civil  Rules,  costs were  generally awarded  to\nprevailing parties as a matter of right in actions at law, and at\nthe  judge's discretion  on  the  equity  side.

But  the  case law  is  arrayed\n\nagainst appellees' position, for the courts have never structured\n\nthe  secondary principle  of  sovereign immunity  in such  an odd\n\nconfiguration.    Cf.,  e.g.,  id.  at  267-68  (stating  without\n                                  \n\nqualification  that  fee  awards  against  the  government,   \"if\n\nallowable at  all, must be  expressly provided for  by statute\").\n\nWhat  is more, a number of courts, ruling on comparable bad-faith\n\nsanctions, have either held  that sovereign immunity applies, see\n                                                                 \n\nsupra pp.  16-17, or  taken for  granted that  sovereign immunity\n     \n\nwould apply absent a waiver, see supra pp. 15-16.13\n                                      \n\n          The  straw that  snaps  the camel's  back  is that  the\n\nappellees have offered no plausible explanation why the shield of\n\nimmunity  should  leave  the  government exposed  to  fee  awards\n\ndesigned as  sanctions for  litigation abuse, but  simultaneously\n\nprotect  it from fees or other monetary awards routinely given to\n\nprevailing  parties  as  virtual  bonuses  to  reward  litigatory\n\nsuccess.   The simple, unarguable  fact is that any  and all such\n\nfee awards  would deplete the public  coffers, and, consequently,\n\n                    \n\n     13In this regard, fines for civil contempt under 18 U.S.C.  \n401,  quoted  supra  note  9,  are of  special  interest  because\n                   \ncontempt originated  as an aspect  of the supervisory  power, see\n                                                                 \nShillitani v. United  States, 384  U.S. 364, 370  (1966), and  it\n                            \ncontinues to serve essentially \"the same purpose\" as do sanctions\nimposed under the supervisory power  in respect to litigants' and\nlawyers' bad-faith  tactics, Chambers,  501 U.S. at  53 (citation\n                                     \nomitted).   The better reasoned decisions hold that, when the two\ndoctrines lock  horns, contempt is barred  by sovereign immunity.\nSee  supra p. 17.   Although these decisions  have little bearing\n          \nhere because  they turn,  explicitly or implicitly,  on statutory\ninterpretation, they  do show that  the principle of  immunity to\nmonetary  damages is  understood  by thoughtful  courts to  sweep\nbroadly.\n\n                                23\n\nthey all must stand  on the same footing vis-a-vis  principles of\n\nsovereign immunity.  It follows inexorably that, absent a statute\n\nor  rule  effectuating  a  waiver,  the  secondary  principle  of\n\nsovereign   immunity   bars  fee-shifting   awards   against  the\n\ngovernment, whatever their intended purpose.\n\n          2.

Separation of  Powers.\n                                   \n\nis  that stripping away the power to assess monetary penalties in\n\ncriminal cases would leave courts  defenseless against litigation\n\nabuses committed by the government   which is, after all, a party\n\nto every criminal case in the federal system   and thereby  would\n\noffend the separation of  powers.  See McBride,  955 F.2d at  582\n                                              \n\n(Lay,  C.J.,  concurring  and  dissenting)   (developing  similar\n\nthesis);  cf. Chilcutt v. United  States, 4 F.3d  1313, 1327 (5th\n                                        \n\nCir.  1993)  (making   comparable  suggestion  in   significantly\n\ndifferent context;  upholding  monetary sanction  levied  against\n\nfederal  prosecutor  personally).     This  contention  seriously\n\noverstates the case, and, in all events, asks us to do Congress's\n\nwork.\n\n          The  fact   that  sovereign  immunity   forecloses  the\n\nimposition of  monetary sanctions against the  federal government\n\nin criminal cases  does not leave federal courts  at the mercy of\n\ncantankerous  prosecutors.   Courts  have many  other weapons  in\n\ntheir armamentarium.  This case aptly illustrates the point.

In  addition, the  judge could have  ordered the  lead\n\nprosecutor to pay the  accumulated fees, see Chilcutt, 4  F.3d at\n                                                     \n\n1319 (upholding  order that  government counsel pay,  inter alia,\n                                                                \n\nfor time  spent by defense  counsel at contempt  hearing, without\n\nbeing reimbursed); United States  v.

See Larson,  337 U.S. at 693 (noting  that sovereign\n                       \nimmunity does not protect federal officials in the performance of\nacts  that  are   unconstitutional  or  beyond   their  statutory\nauthority); see also Chilcutt,  4 F.3d at 1327; Sumitomo  Marine,\n                                                                \n617 F.2d at 1370-71.\n\n     15Although  the  district  court eschewed  these  additional\nremedies,  the  Justice  Department  later  engaged  its internal\ndisciplinary mechanism on its own initiative.\n\n                                26\n\nto catch the Justice  Department's attention, punish the culprit,\n\nand deter future prosecutorial excesses.\n\n          Of  course, there is a more  broadly focused reason why\n\nthe separation-of-powers argument will not wash.  While sovereign\n\nimmunity may  marginally limit  the courts' ability  to function,\n\nthere  is nothing  sacrosanct about  the courts' power  to impose\n\nsanctions.    Congress  has   wide-ranging  authority  to   limit\n\nsupervisory  powers generally.   See  Chambers,  501 U.S.  at 47.\n                                              \n\nThis  includes the  authority  to place  restrictions on  courts'\n\ninherent power  to shift  fees.   See Alyeska,  421  U.S. at  259\n                                             \n\n(recognizing \"inherent  power in  the courts to  allow attorneys'\n\nfees in  particular situations, unless  forbidden by  Congress\").\n\nIt  also includes the authority  to regulate the courts' inherent\n\npower in  respect to contempt.  See 18 U.S.C.   401, quoted supra\n                                                                 \n\nnote  9.   Circumscription  of  the  fee-shifting  power  by  the\n\napplication of an ancient (but still viable) common law doctrine,\n\nsubject  to  waiver through  congressional  action,  comprises no\n\ngreater insult to the independence of the Judicial Branch.\n\n          Our  last  response to  appellees' separation-of-powers\n\nargument is to note  its indeterminacy.  The same  argument could\n\nbe,  and has  been, turned  180  degrees.   At  least one  highly\n\nrespected scholar maintains that sovereign immunity \"furthers the\n                                                             \n\nseparation of powers by  limiting judicial oversight of executive\n\nconduct . . .  [and thus] avoid[ing] situations where  the courts\n\nwill impose orders on the other branches of government that might\n\nbe  disregarded.\"    Erwin  Chemirinsky,  Federal  Jurisdiction  \n                                                               \n\n                                27\n\n9.2.1, at 545-46 (2d ed. 1994) (emphasis supplied).\n\n          We  will  not  paint  the lily.    Neither  policy  nor\n\nprecedent supports the proposition  that the separation of powers\n\nrequires  taking the  quantum leap  essayed by  the  court below.\n\nLeaving  monetary imposts  to one  side, the  range and  reach of\n\nother  sanctions, remedial  and punitive,  that are  available to\n\nfederal criminal  courts permit those courts  to administer their\n\ndockets and  conduct judicial  business with a  sufficiently free\n\nhand.  Courts, like litigants, must abide by certain rules    and\n\nto the  extent that sovereign immunity curbs  judicial power, the\n\nrestraint  is tolerable in the constitutional sense.  In the last\n\nanalysis, then,  appellees' contention that  criminal courts  are\n\nleft impotent if they are deprived of the power to  shift fees as\n\na  sanction against the government  is as empty  as a mendicant's\n\npurse.\n\n          To  summarize, none  of  the  various possible  detours\n\nmanage to bypass  the barrier  of sovereign immunity.   We  hold,\n\ntherefore,  that  fee-shifting  against  the  government  can  be\n\naccomplished only in  conjunction with the  passage of a  statute\n\n(or a sufficiently explicit  rule having the force of  a statute)\n\nthat  authorizes  such an  award.    In the  absence  of such  an\n\nenactment, the  secondary principle  of sovereign  immunity saves\n\nthe federal  government harmless from all  court-imposed monetary\n\nassessments, regardless of their timing and purpose.\n\nIV.  APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n          We have one more  bridge to cross.  It  is hornbook law\n\n                                28\n\nthat  a court  cannot  act  in  the  absence  of  subject  matter\n\njurisdiction;  and that,  when  such jurisdiction  is lacking,  a\n\ncourt is obliged  to note the defect on its  own initiative.  See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States v. Pierro,      F.3d    ,     (1st  Cir. 1994) [No.\n                       \n\n93-1313, slip op. at 13-14]; In  re Recticel Foam Corp., 859 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n1000, 1002  (1st Cir. 1988); see also American Policyholders Ins.\n                                                                 \n\nCo. v.

Parties\n\ncannot confer subject matter jurisdiction on either a trial or an\n\nappellate   court  by  indolence,   oversight,  acquiescence,  or\n\nconsent.\n\n                     A.  Appeal as of Right.\n                                           \n\n          The Appellate Rules require  that an appellant's  brief\n\ncontain \"a statement of  the basis for jurisdiction in  the court\n\nof  appeals .  .  . with  reference to  the  applicable facts  to\n\nestablish  such jurisdiction.\"    Fed. R.  App. P.  28(a)(2)(ii).\n\nComplying, perhaps, with the letter of the rule, but not with its\n\nspirit,  the government's  brief  states in  a purely  conclusory\n\nfashion only that its appeal is authorized under 28 U.S.C.   1291\n\n(1988).16    Despite  this  blithe  assurance,  the  government's\n\nentitlement  to an  appeal  as of  right  under section  1291  is\n\nproblematic.  We explain briefly.\n\n                    \n\n     16The  statute provides in  pertinent part,  with exceptions\nnot relevant here,  that \"the courts of appeals .  . . shall have\njurisdiction  of appeals from all final decisions of the district\ncourts of the United States . . . .\"  28 U.S.C.   1291.\n\n                                29\n\n          An  appeal by the government in a criminal case must be\n\nspecifically authorized by statute.  See United States v. Sanges,\n                                                                \n\n144 U.S.  310, 312  (1892).   The appeal before  us does  not fit\n\nneatly  into  the confines  of 18  U.S.C.    3731  (affording the\n\nUnited  States a right of appeal from certain described orders in\n\ncriminal cases, e.g.,  orders dismissing indictments, suppressing\n                    \n\nevidence, or mandating  the return  of seized  property), or  any\n\nmore  specialized statute  conferring a  right  of appeal  on the\n\ngovernment  in   criminal  cases,  e.g.,  18   U.S.C.     3742(b)\n                                       \n\n(permitting the  United States to appeal  from certain sentencing\n\ndeterminations).  And it is settled that, at least in the absence\n\nof   very  special   circumstances,  the   general  authorization\n\ncontained  in  section  1291  is  not  sufficiently  specific  to\n\nauthorize an appeal by the  government in a criminal case.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., Arizona v. Manypenny,  451 U.S. 232, 246-47 (1981)  (citing\n                          \n\ncases); United States v.  Patterson, 882 F.2d 595, 599  (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1027 (1990).\n                   \n\n          Notwithstanding  this  looming  obstacle  to  appellate\n\njurisdiction  under  section  1291,  we believe  that  this  case\n\ninvolves a  sufficiently special  set of circumstances  to engage\n\nthe exception rather than  the rule.  Some courts  have suggested\n\nthat, under  what we  choose to  call the \"special  circumstance\"\n\nexception, a government appeal may  be entertained in a  criminal\n\ncase on the authority of section 1291 if the appeal satisfies the\n\nconditions  of the  so-called  collateral order  doctrine.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  Carroll  v.

Powers,\n                                                                \n\n622  F.2d 317, 319-20 n.2 (8th Cir.),  cert. denied, 449 U.S. 837\n                                                   \n\n(1980).  Application of the collateral order doctrine is \"limited\n\nto  orders that  (1) conclusively  determine (2)  important legal\n\nquestions  which are (3)  completely separate from  the merits of\n\nthe  underlying action  and are  (4) effectively  unreviewable on\n\nappeal  from  a  final judgment.\"    Doughty  v. Underwriters  at\n                                                                 \n\nLloyd's, London, 6 F.3d 856, 862  (1st Cir. 1993); see also Cohen\n                                                                 \n\nv. Beneficial Loan  Corp., 337 U.S. 541,  546 (1949) (originating\n                         \n\ndoctrine). We think that these conditions are met in  this case.\n\n          Moreover,   the   particular  circumstances   at  hand,\n\nespecially the procedural posture in which this appeal arises and\n\nthe  nature of the relief  sought, are conducive  to allowing the\n\nappeal  to go  forward.   In criminal  cases, the  policy against\n\npermitting appeals to be taken too freely is heightened by speedy\n\ntrial and double jeopardy  concerns.  See Will v.  United States,\n                                                                \n\n389  U.S. 90, 96 (1967); DiBella  v. United States, 369 U.S. 121,\n                                                  \n\n126 (1962).   Here, those concerns do not come  into play at all:\n\nthe  determination  of  the  defendants'  guilt  has  been  made,\n\nsentence  has   been  imposed,   the  attempted  appeal   is  not\n\ninterlocutory  in  any  sense,   and  no  prospect  of  piecemeal\n\nlitigation endures.\n\n          We conclude, therefore, that  we have jurisdiction over\n\nthe  instant  appeal  under 28  U.S.C.     1291.   We  emphasize,\n\nhowever, that our holding is a narrow one.  Rather than importing\n\nthe  collateral order doctrine  lock, stock, and  barrel into our\n\n                                31\n\ncriminal  jurisprudence,  we hold  only  that when,  as  now, the\n\nconditions  of the  collateral  order  doctrine are  satisfied,17\n\nand the prudential concerns   that traditionally militate against\n\nallowing  the government to appeal  in a criminal  case favor, or\n\nare  at  least  neutral in  respect  to,  the  availability of  a\n\ngovernment appeal,  then section  1291 affords a  vehicle through\n\nwhich  the  government may  seek appellate  review in  a criminal\n\ncase.\n\n                          B.  Mandamus.\n                                      \n\n          We are  fortified in our resolve to  hear and determine\n\nthis appeal by the knowledge  that, even if no appeal lies  as of\n\nright, we possess   and can appropriately exercise   the power of\n\ndiscretionary  review, via  mandamus,18 to address  the important\n\nquestion raised in this case.\n\n                    \n\n     17We are not the  first court to deem an  assessment against\nthe government  qua  prosecutor  to  be a  collateral  order  for\n                   \njurisdictional  purposes.  See  United States v.  Baker, 603 F.2d\n                                                       \n759, 761-62 (9th Cir. 1979) (per curiam) (entertaining government\nappeal,  under section  1291,  from district  court's Rule  15(c)\nassessment  against  government of  deposition-related attorneys'\nfees);  United States  v.

Because prohibition\nis simply the obverse of mandamus   the two writs derive from the\nsame  source,  see 28  U.S.C.    1651,  and incorporate  the same\n                  \nstandards    we often use the two  terms interchangeably.

See, e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.

In a still  smaller\n           \n\nclass  of cases,  mandamus  may lie  even  though all  the  usual\n\nstandards are not met.  See In re Arvedon, 523 F.2d 914, 915 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir. 1975); In re Ellsberg, 446 F.2d 954, 956-57 (1st Cir. 1971);\n                          \n\nsee generally 16 Charles  A.

This tiny class  of cases\n         \n\ninvolves what we have come to call advisory mandamus.19\n\n                    \n\n     19We think  it is  wise to distinguish  supervisory mandamus\nfrom advisory mandamus.   The  former is used  when an  appellate\ncourt  issues  the writ  to  correct an  established  trial court\npractice  that  significantly distorts  proper  procedure.   See,\n                                                                \ne.g., United States v. Kane,  646 F.2d 4, 9 n.7 (1st  Cir. 1981);\n                           \nGrinnell  Corp. v. Hackett, 519  F.2d 595, 599  (1st Cir.), cert.\n                                                                 \ndenied, 423 U.S.  1033 (1975); see  also La Buy v.  Howes Leather\n                                                                 \nCo., 352 U.S.  249, 256-60  (1957).  This  differs from  advisory\n   \nmandamus  in that,  far from  being novel,  the  problem sparking\n\n                                33\n\n          Advisory  mandamus   has  its  roots  in   the  Court's\n\nreference to  mandamus review of \"basic,  undecided question[s].\"\n\nSchlagenhauf  v. Holder,  379  U.S.  104,  110  (1964).    It  is\n                       \n\nappropriate when the  issue presented is  novel, of great  public\n\nimportance, and likely  to recur.  See In re  Justices of Supreme\n                                                                 \n\nCourt of Puerto Rico, 695 F.2d  17, 25 (1st Cir. 1982).  Advisory\n                    \n\nmandamus is not meant to allow review of \"interstitial matters of\n\ncase  administration,\"   Recticel,  859  F.2d  at   1006,  or  to\n                                 \n\ncircumvent   limits   on   appellate  review   of   discretionary\n\ninterlocutory  rulings, see  Sorren, 605 F.2d  at 1216.   Rather,\n                                   \n\nadvisory mandamus is reserved for big game.  It \"should primarily\n\nbe  employed   to  address  questions   `likely  of   significant\n\nrepetition prior to  effective review,' so that our opinion would\n\nassist  other  jurists,  parties,  or lawyers.\"    In  re Bushkin\n                                                                 \n\nAssocs.,  Inc.,  864  F.2d 241,  247  (1st  Cir.  1989) (citation\n              \n\nomitted).20\n\n                    \n\nsupervisory mandamus has by  definition manifested itself on many\noccasions.\n\n     20Because  situations  that properly  call  for  the use  of\nadvisory mandamus \"are hen's-teeth rare,\" In re Bushkin, 864 F.2d\n                                                       \nat 247, relatively few prototypes exist.  This is not to say that\nthe writ  has fallen  into desuetude.   See,  e.g.,  In re  Globe\n                                                                 \nNewspaper Co., 920  F.2d 88, 90 (1st Cir. 1990)  (issuing writ of\n             \nmandamus  directing  district court  to  grant  members of  press\naccess  to  jury  list,  on   theory  that  issue  presented  was\n\"sufficiently  novel and  important\"  to warrant  review); In  re\n                                                                 \nJustices,  695 F.2d  at  25  (indicating  that advisory  writ  of\n        \nprohibition is an appropriate  means by which to direct  district\ncourt  not  to hear  facial  challenges  to rules  governing  bar\nmembership  and dues); see also Nasuti v. Scannell, 906 F.2d 802,\n                                                  \n811  n.15 (1st Cir. 1990) (suggesting  advisory mandamus would be\nappropriate to clarify status  of federal employee immunity under\namendments to Federal Tort Claims Act).\n\n                                34\n\n          If no right of appeal were to exist, the case before us\n\ntoday  would be  a prime  candidate for  advisory mandamus.   The\n\nissue  presented has never before been  squarely decided; yet, it\n\nis  likely to recur, given  the pervasiveness of litigation abuse\n\nin modern practice.  There is a sufficient showing of irreparable\n\nharm in  the sense that,  were no  court to  entertain either  an\n\nappeal or a petition  for mandamus, the matter  might perpetually\n\nevade  review.   Finally,  the  issue  bears  importantly on  the\n\nrelationship  between  the  Judicial  Branch  and  the  Executive\n\nBranch.\n\n          We  regard the  case  for mandamus  here as  especially\n\ncompelling because it is important in the right way.  It poses an\n\nelemental  question of  judicial authority    involving precisely\n\nthe sort of \"Article III-type jurisdictional considerations\" that\n\ntraditionally have  triggered mandamus  review.  In  re Justices,\n                                                                \n\n695  F.2d at 25; see also In re  Pearson, 990 F.2d at 656 (noting\n                                        \n\nthat  mandamus  historically  has  been used  to  check  judicial\n\nusurpation of power); In re Attorney General, 596 F.2d 58, 64 (2d\n                                            \n\nCir.)

Either way,\n\nthe government is entitled to the relief that it seeks.\n\nV.  CONCLUSION\n\n          Having satisfied ourselves that  appellate jurisdiction\n\n                                35\n\ninheres, we now recapitulate.  We agree with the lower court that\n\nthe   government  committed   egregious  acts   of  prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct.  We do not  believe, however, that the court had  the\n\nright  to  ignore  sovereign   immunity  in  responding  to  that\n\nmisconduct.   The  court's  supervisory power,  although  potent,\n\ncannot   intrude,  unaided,   into   the  sovereign's   protected\n\npreserves.\n\n          We need go no further.  Because principles of sovereign\n\nimmunity bar a federal court  from invoking its supervisory power\n\nto compel the federal government to pay attorneys' fees and costs\n\nas a sanction for prosecutorial misconduct in a criminal case, we\n\nreverse  the orders of the district court insofar as they purport\n\nto  shift such fees and costs.   All parties shall bear their own\n\ncosts in this court.\n\n          Reversed.  No costs.\n                             \n\n                                36\n",

We   answer  this  question\n\naffirmatively and,  therefore, annul  the  district court's  fee-\n\nshifting orders.\n\nI.

For\n        \n\npurposes of deciding the abstract question of law that  confronts\n\nus today, we largely omit  the former set of facts, and  limn the\n\nlatter in less than exegetic detail.\n\n          In mid-1992, a federal  grand jury returned a 102-count\n\nindictment  against seven  individuals  allegedly  involved in  a\n\nconspiracy  to  market  and   sell  newly  constructed  homes  by\n\nfraudulent means.  The indictment charged violations of 18 U.S.C.\n\n    2371, 1014 and 1344.  The prosecutors who controlled the case\n\n                                2\n\nwere members of the Justice Department's \"New England Bank  Fraud\n\nTask  Force,\" so  called.   The  defendants,  none of  whom  were\n\nindigent, obtained counsel at their own expense.\n\n          During pretrial proceedings,  the government made  more\n\nthan  10,000 documents  available  for inspection  at the  Boston\n\noffice of Aspen Systems,  an independent document management firm\n\nretained  by the  Task Force.   On November 9,  1992, an attorney\n\nrepresenting defendants Matthew Zsofka,  John Lee, and Evangelist\n\nLacroix visited the document repository to search for papers that\n\nmight prove helpful in cross-examination.  A government paralegal\n\nvolunteered to have a member  of Aspen's clerical staff photocopy\n\nany document that caught the lawyer's eye.  The attorney accepted\n\nthe  offer.  When the paralegal mentioned this undertaking to the\n\nlead  prosecutor, she was  instructed to have  the Aspen employee\n\nmake an  extra copy  of each  defense-selected  document for  the\n\ngovernment's edification.   Defense  counsel was not  informed of\n\nthis added flourish.\n\n          To paraphrase the Scottish poet, the  best-laid schemes\n\nof mice  and prosecutors often go  awry.  Cf. Robert  Burns, To a\n                                                                 \n\nMouse (1785).   When the  photocopying of desired  documents took\n     \n\nlonger  than seemed  reasonable, the  defense attorney  smelled a\n\nrat.    A  cursory   investigation  uncovered  the  prosecution's\n\nexperiment  in  duplicitous  duplication.   The  lawyer  promptly\n\ndemanded that  the government  return its  copies  of the  papers\n\nculled by the  defense.  When  his demand fell  on deaf ears,  he\n\nimmediately drafted a motion  to seal, filed the motion  with the\n\n                                3\n\ndistrict court, and servedit before theclose of business thatday.\n\n          At this  delicate juncture, the lead  prosecutor poured\n\nkerosene  on a raging  fire.1   She did  not passively  await the\n\ncourt's ruling on the motion, but, instead, during the three days\n\nthat  elapsed before the district  court took up  the motion, the\n\nprosecutor  reviewed  the  surreptitiously duplicated  documents,\n\ndiscussed  them  with two  of her  subalterns,  and used  them to\n\nprepare  a key prosecution witness  (in the presence  of a second\n\npossible  witness).  Thus, by  November 13, 1992,  when the court\n\ngranted  the motion  to seal and  explicitly instructed  the lead\n\nprosecutor not to make  further use of the papers singled  out by\n\nthe  defense   or  take  further  advantage   of  the  situation,\n\nappreciable damage already had been done.\n\n          The lead  prosecutor then  made a bad  situation worse.\n\nTwo  pages mysteriously  disappeared from  the lead  prosecutor's\n\ncache of ill-gotten documents before the set was submitted to the\n\ndistrict  court for  sealing.   And  in  direct defiance  of  the\n\ncourt's order,  the lead prosecutor  prepared a complete  new set\n\nfor her own  use.  Adding  insult to injury,  she next signed  an\n\naffidavit of  somewhat questionable veracity.   Finally, when she\n\nappeared before  the district court  to discuss the  bizarre game\n\n                    \n\n     1The district court made a  deliberate decision to spare the\nlead prosecutor  public humiliation and revised  its order before\npublication  to  delete any  mention  of  the prosecutor's  name.\nAlthough  we, if  writing on  a pristine  page, might  not  be so\nsolicitous,  we  honor  the  district  court's  exercise  of  its\ndiscretion, mindful that its choice has substantive implications.\nCf.

Thus, the three of them were\n\nequally  vulnerable  to  the   misconduct  that  occurred.    Not\n\nsurprisingly, the trio moved to dismiss the case on the ground of\n\nprosecutorial  misconduct.2     The  government  objected.     In\n\nevaluating the  motions, the lower  court ruled that  the current\n\nselection  during the  discovery phase of  a pending  case offers\n\ninsight  into  counsel's  thoughts,  and,  therefore, constitutes\n\nprivileged  work product.

After rejecting  the  government's  argument that  the\n\nprivilege  had been  waived, the  court determined that  the lead\n\nprosecutor,  by furtively  copying and  thereafter reviewing  the\n\nselected  documents, crossed the ethical line.

The  other sanctions  have been\n\ncarried out and the defense no longer presses  the claim that the\n\ndistrict court should  have dismissed the indictment.  Hence, all\n\nthat  remains of  the case  is the  government's appeal  from the\n\nassessment of fees.\n\n          The government contests the award chiefly on the ground\n\nthat  it  is prohibited  by  principles  of sovereign  immunity.4\n\nExtracted  from its  complicated  factual  predicate, drained  of\n\nrancor,   and  separated   from  other,   essentially  extraneous\n\ndisputes, this appeal requires us to serve as the dispatcher at a\n\ncrossing where two powerful engines   the judiciary's supervisory\n\npower  and  the  government's  sovereign  immunity     are  on  a\n\ncollision course.\n\nII.

Supervisory Power.\n                                           \n\n          Supervisory  power, sometimes known  as inherent power,\n\nencompasses those powers which, though \"not specifically required\n\nby  the Constitution or the  Congress,\" United States v.

Because  we agree  that the\ngovernment is shielded  from the monetary award by  principles of\nsovereign immunity, we take no view of this asseveration.\n\n                                7\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110933\"><a href=\"/opinion/110933/united-states-v-hasting/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 505  (1983),  are nonetheless  \"necessary  to the\n\nexercise of all others,\" Roadway Express, Inc. v.

See  also United  States v.\n                                                              \nPrince, 1994  U.S.  Dist.

While government  counsel's\ndisobedience  and deception of the court  perhaps could have been\npunished under the  contempt statute,  18 U.S.C.    401, and  the\nentire  fiasco, if conceived as  a discovery violation within the\n\n                                18\n\nthe domain of sovereign  immunity has tended to contract  and the\n\ndomain of supervisory power has tended to expand, we believe that\n\nsovereign immunity  ordinarily will trump supervisory  power in a\n\nhead-to-head confrontation.  The critical determinant is that the\n\ndoctrines are of fundamentally different character:   supervisory\n\npowers are  discretionary and carefully  circumscribed; sovereign\n\nimmunity is  mandatory and  absolute.  Consequently,  whereas the\n\nformer  may be invoked in  the absence of  an applicable statute,\n           \n\nthe  latter must  be  invoked in  the  absence of  an  applicable\n                \n\nstatute; and  whereas the  former may be  tempered by a  court to\n                                     \n\nimpose  certain remedial  measures  and to  withhold others,  the\n\nlatter must be  applied mechanically,  come what may.   In  other\n           \n\nwords, unlike the  doctrine of supervisory power, the doctrine of\n\nsovereign  immunity proceeds by fiat:  if Congress has not waived\n\nthe  sovereign's immunity  in  a given  context,  the courts  are\n\nobliged to honor that immunity.  See, e.g., Meyer, 114  S. Ct. at\n                                                 \n\n                    \n\nambit  of Fed. R. Crim.

P.\n16(d)(2), these possibilities afford no hope of  averting a head-\non collision  between judicial power and sovereign  immunity.  In\nthe first place, the district court's order made it pellucid that\nsupervisory  power comprised  the  sole foundation  on which  the\nmonetary sanction rested.

At first blush, the\n\nconclusion  seems sound.    We are  able  to discern  only  three\n\navenues  by which  appellees arguably  might tip-toe  around this\n\nresult.  We trace each of these routes.\n\n          The most obvious detour around the barrier presented by\n\nsovereign immunity depends on waiver.   If appellees can identify\n\nsome statute or rule,  and show that Congress thereby  lifted the\n\nfederal  government's  sovereign  immunity  in   this  particular\n\ncontext, they would  have an unobstructed path.   But there is no\n\nsuch  statute or rule applicable  here   and  appellees, to their\n\ncredit, do not pretend that one exists.\n\n          The  second detour  embodies  the  assumption that,  in\n\nappropriate  cases, the  judiciary possesses  the naked  power to\n\noverride  sovereign immunity.  We  believe that this  avenue is a\n\ndead end.   One of the main purposes of  sovereign immunity is to\n\nguard against  judicial interference in  executive functions, see\n                                                                 \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104700\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Larson,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/104700/larson-v-domestic-and-foreign-commerce-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  at <span class=\"page\">704</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and  the notion of a  judicial override\n      \n\noperating ex proprio vigore would largely frustrate this purpose.\n                           \n\nIn  any event,  the proposed  detour runs  headlong into  a stone\n\nwall:  Congress, not the  courts, is the government's  authorized\n\nrepresentative for  purposes of waiving sovereign  immunity.  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span>\n                                                                 \n\nsupra </span><pre class=\"inline\">p.13 and cases cited; see also Hans  v.

It is this\n\navenue  that  appellees  most   vigorously  explore.    Shorn  of\n\nrhetoric,  they assert  three  basic reasons  why  the shield  of\n\nimmunity does not  cover such situations.

Punishment.\n                                   \n\npurposes  of  sovereign   immunity,  the  law   historically  has\n\nprecluded  fee-shifting only when it  is employed as  a reward to\n\nprevailing  parties and not when  it is employed  as a punishment\n\nfor  litigation abuse.   This  foray suggests  that what  we have\n\ncalled  the secondary principle of sovereign immunity   the tenet\n\nholding  that  the government  is  immune  to monetary  penalties\n\nimposed  in court  cases   precludes  fee-shifting only  when the\n\nshifted fees are intended  to reward a prevailing party,  and not\n\nwhen they are meant to reprimand a misbehaving party.\n\n          Appellees starts out  on solid ground in the sense that\n\nthe older  cases discussing the secondary  principle of sovereign\n\nimmunity  all  involved  monetary  awards to  prevailing  parties\n\ndirectly attributable to litigatory success.

[and thus] avoid[ing] situations where  the courts\n\nwill impose orders on the other branches of government that might\n\nbe  disregarded.\"    Erwin  Chemirinsky,  Federal  Jurisdiction  \n                                                               \n\n                                27\n\n9.2.1, at 545-46 (2d ed. 1994) (emphasis supplied).\n\n          We  will  not  paint  the lily.    Neither  policy  nor\n\nprecedent supports the proposition  that the separation of powers\n\nrequires  taking the  quantum leap  essayed by  the  court below.\n\nLeaving  monetary imposts  to one  side, the  range and  reach of\n\nother  sanctions, remedial  and punitive,  that are  available to\n\nfederal criminal  courts permit those courts  to administer their\n\ndockets and  conduct judicial  business with a  sufficiently free\n\nhand.  Courts, like litigants, must abide by certain rules    and\n\nto the  extent that sovereign immunity curbs  judicial power, the\n\nrestraint  is tolerable in the constitutional sense.  In the last\n\nanalysis, then,  appellees' contention that  criminal courts  are\n\nleft impotent if they are deprived of the power to  shift fees as\n\na  sanction against the government  is as empty  as a mendicant's\n\npurse.\n\n          To  summarize, none  of  the  various possible  detours\n\nmanage to bypass  the barrier  of sovereign immunity.   We  hold,\n\ntherefore,  that  fee-shifting  against  the  government  can  be\n\naccomplished only in  conjunction with the  passage of a  statute\n\n(or a sufficiently explicit  rule having the force of  a statute)\n\nthat  authorizes  such an  award.    In the  absence  of such  an\n\nenactment, the  secondary principle  of sovereign  immunity saves\n\nthe federal  government harmless from all  court-imposed monetary\n\nassessments, regardless of their timing and purpose.\n\nIV.  APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n          We have one more  bridge to cross.  It  is hornbook law\n\n                                28\n\nthat  a court  cannot  act  in  the  absence  of  subject  matter\n\njurisdiction;  and that,  when  such jurisdiction  is lacking,  a\n\ncourt is obliged  to note the defect on its  own initiative.  See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States v.

Parties\n\ncannot confer subject matter jurisdiction on either a trial or an\n\nappellate   court  by  indolence,   oversight,  acquiescence,  or\n\nconsent.\n\n                     A.

R.  App. P.  28(a)(2)(ii).\n\nComplying, perhaps, with the letter of the rule, but not with its\n\nspirit,  the government's  brief  states in  a purely  conclusory\n\nfashion only that its appeal is authorized under 28 U.S.C.   1291\n\n(1988).16    Despite  this  blithe  assurance,  the  government's\n\nentitlement  to an  appeal  as of  right  under section  1291  is\n\nproblematic.  We explain briefly.\n\n                    \n\n     16The  statute provides in  pertinent part,  with exceptions\nnot relevant here,  that \"the courts of appeals .  . . shall have\njurisdiction  of appeals from all final decisions of the district\ncourts of the United States . . . .\"  28 U.S.C.   1291.\n\n                                29\n\n          An  appeal by the government in a criminal case must be\n\nspecifically authorized by statute.  See United States v.

The appeal before  us does  not fit\n\nneatly  into  the confines  of 18  U.S.C.    3731  (affording the\n\nUnited  States a right of appeal from certain described orders in\n\ncriminal cases, e.g.,  orders dismissing indictments, suppressing\n                    \n\nevidence, or mandating  the return  of seized  property), or  any\n\nmore  specialized statute  conferring a  right  of appeal  on the\n\ngovernment  in   criminal  cases,  e.g.,  18   U.S.C.     3742(b)\n                                       \n\n(permitting the  United States to appeal  from certain sentencing\n\ndeterminations).  And it is settled that, at least in the absence\n\nof   very  special   circumstances,  the   general  authorization\n\ncontained  in  section  1291  is  not  sufficiently  specific  to\n\nauthorize an appeal by the  government in a criminal case.

Here, those concerns do not come  into play at all:\n\nthe  determination  of  the  defendants'  guilt  has  been  made,\n\nsentence  has   been  imposed,   the  attempted  appeal   is  not\n\ninterlocutory  in  any  sense,   and  no  prospect  of  piecemeal\n\nlitigation endures.\n\n          We conclude, therefore, that  we have jurisdiction over\n\nthe  instant  appeal  under 28  U.S.C.     1291.   We  emphasize,\n\nhowever, that our holding is a narrow one.  Rather than importing\n\nthe  collateral order doctrine  lock, stock, and  barrel into our\n\n                                31\n\ncriminal  jurisprudence,  we hold  only  that when,  as  now, the\n\nconditions  of the  collateral  order  doctrine are  satisfied,17\n\nand the prudential concerns   that traditionally militate against\n\nallowing  the government to appeal  in a criminal  case favor, or\n\nare  at  least  neutral in  respect  to,  the  availability of  a\n\ngovernment appeal,  then section  1291 affords a  vehicle through\n\nwhich  the  government may  seek appellate  review in  a criminal\n\ncase.\n\n                          B.

The\n\nissue  presented has never before been  squarely decided; yet, it\n\nis  likely to recur, given  the pervasiveness of litigation abuse\n\nin modern practice.

We agree with the lower court that\n\nthe   government  committed   egregious  acts   of  prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct.  We do not  believe, however, that the court had  the\n\nright  to  ignore  sovereign   immunity  in  responding  to  that\n\nmisconduct.   The  court's  supervisory power,  although  potent,\n\ncannot   intrude,  unaided,   into   the  sovereign's   protected\n\npreserves.\n\n          We need go no further.  Because principles of sovereign\n\nimmunity bar a federal court  from invoking its supervisory power\n\nto compel the federal government to pay attorneys' fees and costs\n\nas a sanction for prosecutorial misconduct in a criminal case, we\n\nreverse  the orders of the district court insofar as they purport\n\nto  shift such fees and costs.   All parties shall bear their own\n\ncosts in this court.\n\n          Reversed.  No costs.\n                             \n\n                                36\n</pre>",
