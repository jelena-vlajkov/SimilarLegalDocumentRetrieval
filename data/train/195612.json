She learned of this action by way of a letter,\n\ndated January  29, 1993,  signed by Nelida  Jimenez Velazquez\n\n(\"Jimenez\"), Director of the Legislative Service Office.2\n\n          On June 22, 1993, Negron sued Jimenez in the United\n\nStates  District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.  Also\n\nnamed   as    defendants   were   Zaida    Hernandez   Torres\n\n(\"Hernandez\"), President  of the House of  Representatives of\n\nthe Commonwealth  of Puerto Rico, and  Roberto Rexach Benitez\n\n(\"Rexach\"), President  of the  Senate of the  Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto  Rico. Negron claimed that  she had been dismissed (1)\n\nbecause  of  her  political  affiliation  with  Puerto Rico's\n\n                    \n\n1.  The purpose  of the Legislative  Library is \"to  make all\nkinds of basic reference material available to the members of\n[Puerto Rico's]  Legislative Assembly  and to persons  in the\ncommunity  who may  be  interested in  gathering data  on the\nlegislative proceedings and  other governmental  activities.\"\n1964 P.R.

They\n\nargued  that  their  decision   to  discharge  Negron  was  a\n\nlegislative   act  protected  by   the  Legislative  Immunity\n\nDoctrine.3   See U.S. Const.  art. I,    6 (Speech  or Debate\n                \n\nClause); P.R.  Const. art. III,    14.  On  October 14, 1993,\n\nNegron  moved for an extension of time within which to oppose\n\ndefendants'  motion to dismiss.   Her motion was  denied.  On\n\nOctober  18, 1993,  the district  court issued  the following\n\norder:\n\n               Before the Court is  the defendants'\n          unopposed  motion to dismiss  for lack of\n          jurisdiction.    After fully  reading the\n          same,  the Court  finds itself  in accord\n          with the legal arguments proffered by the\n          defendants in support of their motion.\n               WHEREFORE, for the reasons stated in\n          defendants' motion, this  case is  hereby\n\n                    \n\n3.  \"The doctrine of absolute [legislative] immunity provides\na complete bar to civil liability for damages,  regardless of\nthe culpability  of the actor  . . .  .\"  Acevedo-Cordero  v.\n                                                         \nCordero-Santiago, 958 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir. 1992).\n                \n\n                             -4-\n\n          DISMISSED  pursuant  to Fed.  R.  Civ. P.\n          12(b)(6).4  (footnote supplied).\n\nJudgment was  entered on  October 29,  1993.  Thereafter,  on\n\nNovember 2, 1993, Negron filed a motion to alter or amend the\n\njudgment  pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).  This motion was\n\nsupplemented by  Negron  on November  4,  1993,  subsequently\n\nopposed by defendants, and  ultimately denied by the district\n\ncourt on November 17, 1993.  This appeal followed on November\n\n29,  1993.5  We do not disturb the district court's dismissal\n\nof  Negron's claims  under  the Due  Process  Clause and  the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, but we reverse the dismissal\n\nof her   1983 claim.\n\n                              I.\n\n          Although defendants ostensibly brought their motion\n\nto  dismiss  under  Fed.  R.  Civ.   P.  12(b)(1)  (\"lack  of\n\n                    \n\n4.  The district court observed  that defendants' motion  was\nunopposed.  Pursuant to Local Rule 311.5 of the United States\nDistrict  Court for the  District of  Puerto Rico,  \"[i]f the\nrespondent  opposes a  motion,  [she] shall  file a  response\nwithin ten (10) days  after service of the motion,  including\nbrief and such supporting documents  as are then available. .\n.  .\"  Failure to  so respond renders  a party susceptible to\ninvoluntary dismissal, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b), for\nfailure  to prosecute.  See Local Rule 313.3 (D.P.R.).  Here,\n                           \nhowever, the district  court dismissed for failure to state a\nclaim, not  failure to prosecute,  and neither the  court nor\nappellees suggest that Negron has waived her  right to appeal\nfrom the  dismissal by initially failing  to oppose Hernandez\nand Jimenez's motion. \n\n5.  Negron filed a  second notice  of appeal  on January  24,\n1994, because her Rule 59(e) motion, while denied on November\n17,  1993,  was not  actually  entered  in  the docket  until\nJanuary 12, 1994.\n\n                             -5-\n\njurisdiction over the  subject matter\"),  the district  court\n\ngranted  it pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (\"failure to\n\nstate  a claim  upon  which relief  can  be granted\").    For\n\npurposes of this appeal, however, we need not decide  whether\n\ndefendants' motion is more  appropriately cast under one rule\n\nor the other.  In either case, we review the district court's\n\ndecision  granting defendants'  motion  to  dismiss de  novo.\n\nVartanian  v.

Resolution Trust Corp., 19  F.3d 950,\n                                              \n\n954 (5th Cir. 1994); e.g., Vartanian, 14 F.3d at 700.\n                                    \n\n          Negron's complaint contained the following relevant\n\nallegations.  Negron began  her employment with Puerto Rico's\n\nLegislative  Library on July  14, 1967, as  a Librarian Grade\n\nII.    She  worked continuously  for  the  library  until she\n\nlearned  of her dismissal by  way of a  letter, dated January\n\n29, 1993, signed by Nelida Jimenez Velazquez, Director of the\n\nLegislative  Service  Office.    During  the  period  of  her\n\nemployment, Negron's  job performance was exemplary.   At the\n\ntime of her discharge, she was a Librarian Grade V.  \n\n          On November 4, 1992     prior to Negron's dismissal\n\n   Zaida Hernandez Torres and Roberto Rexach Benitez, members\n\n                             -6-\n\nof  Puerto  Rico's New  Progressive  Party,  were elected  to\n\nPuerto   Rico's   House   of   Representatives   and  Senate,\n\nrespectively.   On or about  January 11, 1993,  Hernandez was\n\nelected President of the  House of Representatives and Rexach\n\nwas chosen to be President of the Senate.  On that same date,\n\nHernandez and Rexach appointed Jimenez, also a member  of the\n\nNew Progressive  Party, Director  of the  Legislative Service\n\nOffice.    Less  than  three  weeks  later,  Negron,  who  is\n\naffiliated  with Puerto Rico's  Popular Democratic Party, was\n\ndischarged.    She was  replaced by  a New  Progressive Party\n\nactivist.\n\n                             II.\n\n          Negron  argues  on  appeal that,  contrary  to  the\n\ndistrict   court's   conclusion,   defendants'  decision   to\n\ndischarge her was not a legislative act entitled  to absolute\n                     \n\nlegislative immunity from damages under   1983.  We agree.\n\n          It is  established  that \"state  legislators  enjoy\n\ncommon-law immunity from liability for their legislative acts\n\n.  .  .  that is  similar  in  origin and  rationale  to that\n\naccorded  Congressmen under  the  Speech  or Debate  Clause.\"\n\nSupreme Court of Va. v.

This motion was\n\nsupplemented by  Negron  on November  4,  1993,  subsequently\n\nopposed by defendants, and  ultimately denied by the district\n\ncourt on November 17, 1993.  This appeal followed on November\n\n29,  1993.5  We do not disturb the district court's dismissal\n\nof  Negron's claims  under  the Due  Process  Clause and  the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, but we reverse the dismissal\n\nof her   1983 claim.\n\n                              I.\n\n          Although defendants ostensibly brought their motion\n\nto  dismiss  under  Fed.

Here,\n                           \nhowever, the district  court dismissed for failure to state a\nclaim, not  failure to prosecute,  and neither the  court nor\nappellees suggest that Negron has waived her  right to appeal\nfrom the  dismissal by initially failing  to oppose Hernandez\nand Jimenez's motion. \n\n5.  Negron filed a  second notice  of appeal  on January  24,\n1994, because her Rule 59(e) motion, while denied on November\n17,  1993,  was not  actually  entered  in  the docket  until\nJanuary 12, 1994.\n\n                             -5-\n\njurisdiction over the  subject matter\"),  the district  court\n\ngranted  it pursuant to Fed.

Negron began  her employment with Puerto Rico's\n\nLegislative  Library on July  14, 1967, as  a Librarian Grade\n\nII.    She  worked continuously  for  the  library  until she\n\nlearned  of her dismissal by  way of a  letter, dated January\n\n29, 1993, signed by Nelida Jimenez Velazquez, Director of the\n\nLegislative  Service  Office.    During  the  period  of  her\n\nemployment, Negron's  job performance was exemplary.   At the\n\ntime of her discharge, she was a Librarian Grade V.  \n\n          On November 4, 1992     prior to Negron's dismissal\n\n   Zaida Hernandez Torres and Roberto Rexach Benitez, members\n\n                             -6-\n\nof  Puerto  Rico's New  Progressive  Party,  were elected  to\n\nPuerto   Rico's   House   of   Representatives   and  Senate,\n\nrespectively.   On or about  January 11, 1993,  Hernandez was\n\nelected President of the  House of Representatives and Rexach\n\nwas chosen to be President of the Senate.  On that same date,\n\nHernandez and Rexach appointed Jimenez, also a member  of the\n\nNew Progressive  Party, Director  of the  Legislative Service\n\nOffice.    Less  than  three  weeks  later,  Negron,  who  is\n\naffiliated  with Puerto Rico's  Popular Democratic Party, was\n\ndischarged.    She was  replaced by  a New  Progressive Party\n\nactivist.\n\n                             II.\n\n          Negron  argues  on  appeal that,  contrary  to  the\n\ndistrict   court's   conclusion,   defendants'  decision   to\n\ndischarge her was not a legislative act entitled  to absolute\n                     \n\nlegislative immunity from damages under   1983.  We agree.\n\n          It is  established  that \"state  legislators  enjoy\n\ncommon-law immunity from liability for their legislative acts\n\n.  .  .  that is  similar  in  origin and  rationale  to that\n\naccorded  Congressmen under  the  Speech  or Debate  Clause.\"\n\nSupreme Court of Va. v.
