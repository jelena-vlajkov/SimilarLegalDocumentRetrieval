Petitioner Edward  W. Seeley  appeals\r                                \r\n\npro se from  the dismissal  of his second  petition under  28\r                  \r\n\nU.S.C.   2255.  For the following reasons, we affirm.\r\n\n          In February  1987, a federal grand  jury returned a\r\n\nsuperseding indictment charging petitioner with conspiracy in\r\n\nviolation  of  18  U.S.C.     371  (count  I); conspiracy  to\r\n\ninterfere with commerce  by robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  1951 (count II); two  counts of interference with  commerce\r\n\nby robbery in violation of  18 U.S.C.    2, 1951 (counts  III\r\n\nand IV); armed bank  robbery in violation of 18  U.S.C.    2,\r\n\n2113(d) (count V); and possession of money stolen from a bank\r\n\nin violation  of 18 U.S.C.     2,  2113(c) (count  VII).   On\r\n\nFebruary  24, 1988,  a jury acquitted  petitioner of  the two\r\n\nconspiracy charges,  but convicted him of  the remaining four\r\n\ncharges.  The district court sentenced petitioner to  a total\r\n\nof thirty-five years imprisonment.  \r\n\n          We  affirmed  petitioner's  conviction   on  direct\r\n\nappeal.  United States v. Seeley, 892 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1989).\r                                            \r\n\nOn  May 18, 1992, petitioner  filed his first    2255 motion.\r\n\nHe alleged that  counts IV  and V were  multiplicitous.   The\r\n\ndistrict  court vacated  the sentence  on count  V, but  left\r\n\nunchanged  the  total punishment  time.   Petitioner appealed\r\n\nfrom  this  decision, and  we  affirmed.   United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nSeeley, 7  F.3d 219 (1st Cir. 1993) (table) (per curiam).  On\r                  \r\n\nAugust 8, 1994,  petitioner filed his  second   2255  motion,\r\r\n\nclaiming  that  (1)  his convictions  on  counts  III and  IV\r\n\nviolate  the  Double  Jeopardy  Clause and  the  doctrine  of\r\n\ncollateral  estoppel  because he  was  acquitted  of the  two\r\n\nconspiracy charges;  and (2)  his  thirty-five year  sentence\r\n\nviolates due  process because  the district court  considered\r\n\nevidence of his involvement in the conspiracy.   The district\r\n\ncourt dismissed  the petition on the  ground that \"petitioner\r\n\nis not entitled to the relief he seeks.\"  This appeal ensued.\r\n\nBecause the  district court disposed  of the instant  case on\r\n\nthe  merits (rather  than on  abuse of  the writ  ground), we\r\n\nshall do likewise.  \r\n\n          In  support of  his claim  that his  convictions on\r\n\ncounts  III and IV violate the Double Jeopardy Clause and the\r\n\ndoctrine of collateral estoppel, petitioner argues that these\r\n\ncounts  are  multiplicitous  with  counts  I  and  II.   This\r\n\nargument  is  meritless.    First,  double  jeopardy  is  not\r\n\nimplicated  here   since  there   was  a  single   trial  and\r\n\npetitioner, who was acquitted  of the conspiracy charges, did\r\n\nnot  receive  multiple  punishments   for  the  offenses   of\r\n\nconspiracy and  interference with  commerce by robbery.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited  States  v.  Dixon,  113  S.  Ct.  2849,  2855  (1993)\r                                     \r\n\n(observing that the  Double Jeopardy Clause protects  against\r\n\nsuccessive  prosecutions and  successive punishments  for the\r\n\nsame offense); United States v. Flores-Rivera, 1995 WL 318726\r                                                         \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nat  *11, n.5 (1st Cir. June  1, 1995).  Second, a substantive\r\n\ncrime and a conspiracy to commit that\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ncrime are not the same offense  for double jeopardy purposes.\r\n\nUnited States v. Felix, 503 U.S. 378, 389-92 (1992); Callanan\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. United  States, 364  U.S. 587,  597 (1961)  (conspiracy to\r                             \r\n\nviolate the  Hobbs Act  and  a substantive  violation of  the\r\n\nHobbs Act based on the same conduct are two separate offenses\r\n\neven  though   both  offenses  violate  the   same  statute).\r\n\nFinally, although  the doctrine  of collateral  estoppel bars\r\n\nrelitigation of issues previously determined in a defendant's\r\n\nfavor, it  does  not, contrary  to  petitioner's  suggestion,\r\n\nrequire the verdict rendered at a single trial to be entirely\r\n\nconsistent.   See United States v. Console, 13 F.3d 641, 664-\r                                                      \r\n\n65  &amp; n.28  (3d  Cir. 1993),  cert. denied,  114 S.  Ct. 1660\r                                                      \r\n\n(1994).\r\n\n          Petitioner's  due  process   argument  is   equally\r\n\nunavailing.   It is well-established that  a sentencing court\r\n\nmay consider relevant conduct--including the facts underlying\r\n\nan acquittal----in  determining the length  of a  defendant's\r\n\nsentence.   See United States v. Mocciola, 891 F.2d 13, 16-17\r                                                     \r\n\n(1st  Cir.  1989)  (sentencing   court  may  consider   facts\r\n\nunderlying  prior acquittal);  United States  v. Wright,  873\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d 437, 441 (1st Cir.  1989) (observing that past practice,\r\n\nand authoritative case  law, indicates that the  Constitution\r\n\ndoes  not,  as  a  general matter,  forbid  consideration  of\r\n\nrelevant conduct).    Assuming, arguendo, that the sentencing\r                                                    \r\n\ncourt in\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nthe   instant  case   considered  evidence   of  petitioner's\r\n\ninvolvement in  the conspiracy  in determining the  length of\r\n\nhis sentence, this was not error.\r\n\n          Affirmed.  \r                              \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n",

Finally, although the doctrine of collateral estoppel bars relitigation of issues previously determined in a defendant's favor, it does not, contrary to petitioner's suggestion, require the verdict rendered at a single trial to be entirely consistent.  See United States v. Console, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"660188\"><a href=\"/opinion/660188/united-states-v-richard-p-console-united-states-of-america-v-morton/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span>, 664-65 &amp; n.28 (3d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is well-established that a sentencing court may consider relevant conduct-including the facts underlying an acquittal----in determining the length of a defendant's sentence.  See United States v. Mocciola, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533000\"><a href=\"/opinion/533000/united-states-v-gerard-peter-mocciola/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1989) (sentencing court may consider facts underlying prior acquittal);  United States v. Wright, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522147\"><a href=\"/opinion/522147/united-states-v-bertie-alexander-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span>, 441 (1st Cir. 1989) (observing that past practice, and authoritative case law, indicates that the Constitution does not, as a general matter, forbid consideration of relevant conduct).  Assuming, arguendo, that the sentencing court in the instant case considered evidence of petitioner's involvement in the conspiracy in determining the length of his sentence, this was not error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
