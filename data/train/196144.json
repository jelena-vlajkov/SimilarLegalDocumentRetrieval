The court did not abuse its discretion\r                                \r\n\nin first denying plaintiff a continuance and later dismissing\r\n\nplaintiff's  action with  prejudice  when plaintiff  did  not\r\n\nappear  for trial.   Plaintiff had  sufficient notice  of the\r\n\ntrial date and adequate time to prepare.  Plaintiff's hope or\r\n\nexpectation  that his  case  would not  be  tried until  mid-\r\n\nNovember  was   unjustified,  for   it  was   quite  possible\r\n\nthroughout   that   the   intervening   case   would  settle.\r\n\nConsequently, plaintiff  should  have been  ready to  proceed\r\n\nwhen the case did settle.\r\n\n          Plaintiff argues that dismissal with  prejudice was\r\n\ntoo harsh because  he had  not exhibited a  pattern of  delay\r\n\n(instead, he had duly appeared at all prior conferences)  and\r\n\nbecause, plaintiff  believes, defendant  would not  have been\r\n\nprejudiced  had  plaintiff been  permitted  to  reinstate his\r\n\ncase.   We disagree.  A continuance had been properly denied,\r\n\nthe jury  had  been empaneled,  and  trial was  scheduled  to\r\n\nproceed when  plaintiff failed to appear.  The district court\r\n\nwas well within its discretion in concluding that plaintiff's\r\n\ndisregard  for the  court's  scheduling  order warranted  the\r\n\nharshest  sanction.

Even if  -- as  plaintiff\r\n\nasserts --  defendant agreed not  to seek costs  if plaintiff\r\n\ndiscontinued his case,  plaintiff essentially repudiated that\r\n\nagreement by moving  to vacate the court's order of dismissal\r\n\nand to set his case for trial.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
