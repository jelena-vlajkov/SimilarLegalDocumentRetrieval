Chapman and Orr  and Reno, Prof.  Assoc. on brief  for\r                                                                \r\nappellees.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  The plaintiff, now  serving a term for\r                                \r\n\npossession  of  child  pornography,  was  the  subject  of  a\r\n\ntelevision program that portrayed him as one who had sexually\r\n\nabused and exploited his  own children.  In this  jury waived\r\n\nlibel action by  the plaintiff against those  involved in the\r\n\nprogram, the  district court ruled on  summary judgment that,\r\n\nwhether  the program was accurate  or not, the defendants had\r\n\nmet  the local libel  rules by exercising  reasonable care in\r\n\ntheir   investigation.    See,   e.g.,  Duchesnaye  v.  Munro\r                                                                         \r\n\nEnterprises, Inc.,  125 N.H.  244, 251 (1984);  accord, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nKassel v. Gannet Co., 875 F.2d 935, 943 (1st Cir. 1989).  For\r                                \r\n\nthe reasons given  by the  district court, we  agree that  no\r\n\nfactual  issue  was  presented  as  to  the  adequacy  of the\r\n\ninvestigation on those charges.\r\n\n          The  television program  itself, despite  a shallow\r\n\npretence  at serious reporting, was -- as to the plaintiff --\r\n\na highly colored and inflammatory version of the events.  But\r\n\nthere seems to have been at least some evidence for, and some\r\n\ninvestigation  of, various  key charges.   The  most dramatic\r\n\nexception  was the suggestion, for which we have been offered\r\n\nno evidence whatever, that  plaintiff served in a pornography\r\n\nring  that was  involved  in the  murder  of children.    But\r\n\nplaintiff   himself  failed  to   stress  this  murder  claim\r\n\nadequately in opposing summary judgment, it went  unmentioned\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nby  the district  judge,  and we  think  it  is too  late  to\r\n\nresurrect it now.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
