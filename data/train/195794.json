Richard  Barrett, a  leader of  and\n\nattorney for the Nationalist Movement, failed to comply with this\n\nrequirement  and  the  Movement  appeals  the  resulting  summary\n\ndismissal of its lawsuit.   Barrett asserted below and  on appeal\n\nthat  his  diligent  efforts   to  secure  local  counsel  proved\n\nunsuccessful,  attributing  this   failure  to  the   Nationalist\n\nMovement's  controversial views.    He argues  that, under  these\n\ncircumstances, dismissing his lawsuit  for failure to comply with\n\nRule 83.5.3 violates several constitutional provisions.\n\n     After careful consideration of  the briefs, we are uncertain\n\nwhether appellant was, in fact, unable to locate local counsel to\n\nmove  his admission  pro  hac  vice.

If the  district court determines that Barrett  engaged in\n\ndiligent  but unavailing  efforts to  find local  counsel and  it\n\nagain  dismisses the suit, appellant, of course, would be free to\n\nappeal  again.     If  the  district  court  finds  that  Barrett\n\nmisrepresented  his efforts to  locate local counsel,  or that he\n\ndeclined  any offer by local  counsel to appear,  it may consider\n\nwhatever sanctions, including those described by  Fed.
