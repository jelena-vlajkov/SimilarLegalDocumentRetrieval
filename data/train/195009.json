Appellant Huvar Valencia  pled guilty\n                    \n\nto  a  two  count indictment  charging  conspiracy  to commit\n\noffenses against the United States in violation of 18  U.S.C.\n\n   371, and  attempted smuggling  of aliens  into the  United\n\nStates in violation of 8 U.S.C.   1324(a)(1)(A).  The objects\n\nof the conspiracy were to travel and use telephone facilities\n\nin interstate  commerce  with intent  to  commit a  crime  in\n\nviolation  of  18  U.S.C.     1952(a)(2)  and  1952(a)(3), to\n\nattempt to bring aliens  into the United States  in violation\n\nof  8  U.S.C.     1324(a)(1)(A),  to  transport  firearms  in\n\ninterstate  commerce  with  intent  to  commit  a  felony  in\n\nviolation of  18 U.S.C.    924(b), and to transfer  a firearm\n\nknowing it would  be used  to commit a  crime of violence  in\n\nviolation  of     18  U.S.C.  924(h).    In   sentencing  the\n\ndefendant,  the district  court  upwardly  departed from  the\n\napplicable  guideline sentencing range  (GSR) of four  to ten\n\nmonths  and sentenced  Valencia  to  a  term  of  twenty-four\n\nmonths.  Valencia appeals from this sentence.  \n\n          For the most  part, the facts in this  case are not\n\nin dispute.   According to the Pre-Sentence  Report, Valencia\n\nwas  a participant  in a  plot to  break some members  of the\n\nMedellin   cocaine  cartel  out  of  a  Canadian  prison  and\n\ntransport them to the United States, from where they would be\n\nflown to Colombia.   Valencia's alleged  role was to  deliver\n\n                             -2-\n\nvehicles and weapons1 from the  United States to members of a\n\nbreak-out team in  Canada.  Co-conspirators based  in Canada,\n\nand not the  defendant, served time  in Canadian prisons  for\n\nconduct  related to  this  break-out  plan,  in  addition  to\n\nreceiving  prison terms in the United States district court.2\n\nThe sole  issue  on  appeal is  whether  the  district  court\n\ndeparted upward to the extent that it did in an impermissible\n\nattempt to  achieve symmetry between Valencia's  sentence and\n\nthe combined Canadian and United States  sentences of his co-\n\nconspirators.\n\n          The district  court stated at  sentencing that  the\n\nupward   departure  was  rooted  principally  in  U.S.S.G.   \n\n5K2.9.3   The  court  found    5K2.9  applicable as  Valencia\n\n                    \n\n1.  Although Valencia pled guilty  to conspiracy to receiving\nand  transferring firearms, he  denied at sentencing  that he\nwas  the person who  actually delivered these  weapons across\nthe border.\n\n2.  Co-conspirators received  sixteen month sentences  in the\nUnited  States  district  court  and,  it  appears,  received\ntwenty-four  month sentences in  Canadian courts (a  total of\nforty  months  in  United  States  and  Canadian  sentences).\nValencia  argues that  he should  have  received, at  most, a\nsixteen month  sentence in  the district  court and that  the\nonly  explanation for his  twenty-four month sentence  was an\nattempt  by the district court to achieve sentencing symmetry\nbetween his term and his co-defendants' total terms.  \n\n3.  Section 5K2.9  Criminal Purpose (Policy Statement) \n                                   \n\n          If  the defendant committed the offense in order to\n          facilitate  or conceal  the  commission of  another\n          offense, the  court may increase the sentence above\n          the   guideline  range   to   reflect  the   actual\n          seriousness of the defendant's conduct.\n\n                             -3-\n\ncommitted  his offenses in order to facilitate or conceal the\n\ncommission of another offense--the attempted prison  breakout\n\nof  the  Medellin cartel  members.   In  addition,  the court\n\nstated that in  deciding to depart upward,  it considered the\n\nfact that semi-automatic weapons were used, the disruption of\n\ngovernmental function that  would have resulted had  the plan\n\nto break into the Canadian  prison been successful, and  \"the\n\nnature of  the unusual and extreme conduct given the analysis\n\nof the Court in United States v. Johnson.\"4 \n                                        \n\n          The  upward departure was  from Offense Level  9 to\n\nOffense Level 17.  The defendant's twenty-four month sentence\n\nrepresented  a  140% increase  over  the GSR's  ceiling.   In\n\nexplaining the extent  of the upward departure,  the district\n\ncourt stated that  it had considered the same  factors it had\n\nconsidered  in deciding  to depart  upward.   The  court also\n\nstated that it  had departed upward to the level  that it did\n\n                    \n\n4.  In Johnson, 952  F.2d 565 (1st Cir.  1991), cert. denied,\n                                                            \n    U.S.     ,  113 S.  Ct.  58, 121  L.  Ed. 2d  27  (1992),\ndefendants  were  convicted  of  conspiracy  and  substantive\noffenses  relating to  their  roles  in terrorist  activities\ndirected towards the British in Northern Ireland.  On appeal,\nwe   upheld  as  proper  grounds  for  upward  departure  the\ncircumstances  relied upon  by the district  court, including\n\"the   potential  for  death  to  innocent  people\"  and  the\n\"extreme\"  amount  of  \"planning and  sophistication\"  in the\nconspiracy.  952 F.2d at 583.   The upward departure here  is\nwarranted on the same grounds.\n\n                             -4-\n\nbased  on the  defendant's role  in  the undertaking  and his\n\nculpability.5 \n\n          In  United  States  v. Wogan,  938  F.2d  1446 (1st\n                                      \n\nCir.), cert. denied,     U.S.    , 112 S. Ct. 441, 116 L. Ed.\n                   \n\n2d 460  (1991), we held that  the district court erred,  as a\n\nmatter of  law, in basing  a downward departure solely  in an\n\neffort to achieve sentencing parity between Wogan and his co-\n\ndefendant.   In  the instant  case, the district  court noted\n\nfrom the  bench that it was mindful  of our decision in Wogan\n                                                             \n\nand  specifically stated that  it did not  depart to maintain\n\nany  kind  of  equalization  or  symmetry  between Valencia's\n\nsentence  and  those  of  his  co-defendants.    The  written\n\njudgment  stated, however,  that the  court  \"also took  into\n\nconsideration the  sentences of the  co-defendants, including\n\nthe  imposition of Canadian prison  terms for like or similar\n\nconduct.\"     Valencia relied  on this  apparent conflict  in\n\nsupport of his contention  that, contrary to the teaching  of\n\n                    \n\n5.  Defendant  argues   that  the  district   court  did  not\nspecifically explain why it departed  upward to Level 17.  We\nhave previously stated that\n     when   the   court   has   provided   a    reasoned\n     justification for  its decision to depart, and that\n     statement  constitutes  an  adequate  summary  from\n     which   an  appellate   tribunal   can  gauge   the\n     reasonableness of the departure's extent, it has no\n     obligation to  go further  and attempt  to quantify\n     the  impact  of  each  incremental  factor  on  the\n     departure sentence.\nUnited States  v. Emery, 991  F.2d 907, 913 (1st  Cir. 1993).\n                       \nHere,  the court's articulated grounds for departing, and for\nthe extent of the departure, were adequate.\n\n                             -5-\n\nWogan, the district court departed  to the extent that it did\n     \n\nto achieve symmetry between his own sentence and those of co-\n\ndefendants.         At   the  request   of  the   government,\n\nhowever,  we  remanded the  case  to  the district  court  to\n\nclarify the record.  In response, the district court issued a\n\nmemorandum stating that the oral statements made by the court\n\nat sentencing correctly  reflect the basis of  its sentencing\n\ndecision and that \"[t]he sentences received by Mr. Valencia's\n\nco-defendants were not  considered by the court  in departing\n\nfrom the Guidelines  or the extent of  such departure.\"    We\n\nare  satisfied that the  district court's response  on remand\n\ndisposes of Valencia's  argument to the  extent based on  any\n\narguable conflict in  statements made by the  district court.\n\nSee also United States  v. Villano, 816 F.2d 1448, 1450 (10th\n                                  \n\nCir. 1987) (en banc) (\"It is a firmly established and settled\n\nprinciple of federal  criminal law that an  orally pronounced\n\nsentence controls over  a judgment and commitment  order when\n\nthe two conflict.

The objects of the conspiracy were to travel and use telephone facilities in interstate commerce with intent to commit a crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1952(a)(2) and 1952(a)(3), to attempt to bring aliens into the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1324(a)(1)(A), to transport firearms in interstate commerce with intent to commit a felony in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(b), and to transfer a firearm knowing it would be used to commit a crime of violence in violation of &#167; 18 U.S.C. 924(h).  In sentencing the defendant, the district court upwardly departed from the applicable guideline sentencing range (GSR) of four to ten months and sentenced Valencia to a term of twenty-four months.  Valencia appeals from this sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the most part, the facts in this case are not in dispute.  According to the Pre-Sentence Report, Valencia was a participant in a plot to break some members of the Medellin cocaine cartel out of a Canadian prison and transport them to the United States, from where they would be flown to Colombia.  Valencia's alleged role was to deliver vehicles and weapons<sup>1</sup> from the United States to members of a break-out team in Canada.  Co-conspirators based in Canada, and not the defendant, served time in Canadian prisons for conduct related to this break-out plan, in addition to receiving prison terms in the United States district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court departed upward to the extent that it did in an impermissible attempt to achieve symmetry between Valencia's sentence and the combined Canadian and United States sentences of his co-conspirators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court stated at sentencing that the upward departure was rooted principally in U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.9.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The court found &#167; 5K2.9 applicable as Valencia committed his offenses in order to facilitate or conceal the commission of another offense-the attempted prison breakout of the Medellin cartel members.  In addition, the court stated that in deciding to depart upward, it considered the fact that semi-automatic weapons were used, the disruption of governmental function that would have resulted had the plan to break into the Canadian prison been successful, and \"the nature of the unusual and extreme conduct given the analysis of the Court in United States v. Johnson.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The upward departure was from Offense Level 9 to Offense Level 17.  The defendant's twenty-four month sentence represented a 140% increase over the GSR's ceiling.  In explaining the extent of the upward departure, the district court stated that it had considered the same factors it had considered in deciding to depart upward.  The court also stated that it had departed upward to the level that it did based on the defendant's role in the undertaking and his culpability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In  United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span> </span>(1991), we held that the district court erred, as a matter of law, in basing a downward departure solely in an effort to achieve sentencing parity between Wogan and his co-defendant.  In the instant case, the district court noted from the bench that it was mindful of our decision in Wogan and specifically stated that it did not depart to maintain any kind of equalization or symmetry between Valencia's sentence and those of his co-defendants.  The written judgment stated, however, that the court \"also took into consideration the sentences of the co-defendants, including the imposition of Canadian prison terms for like or similar conduct.\"  Valencia relied on this apparent conflict in support of his contention that, contrary to the teaching of Wogan, the district court departed to the extent that it did to achieve symmetry between his own sentence and those of co-defendants.  At the request of the government, however, we remanded the case to the district court to clarify the record.  In response, the district court issued a memorandum stating that the oral statements made by the court at sentencing correctly reflect the basis of its sentencing decision and that \"[t]he sentences received by Mr. Valencia's co-defendants were not considered by the court in departing from the Guidelines or the extent of such departure.\"  We are satisfied that the district court's response on remand disposes of Valencia's argument to the extent based on any arguable conflict in statements made by the district court.
