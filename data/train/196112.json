On April  14, 1993, a jury convicted  Flores-Rivera on\r\n\none  count of conspiracy to import cocaine and to possess cocaine\r\n\nwith intent  to distribute it, in  violation of 21  U.S.C.    846\r\n\nand 963 (Count 2), and two counts of assaulting a federal officer\r\n\nwith a deadly weapon, in violation  of 18 U.S.C.   111, (Counts 5\r\n\nand 6).  The jury acquitted Flores-Rivera on Counts 3, 4, and 34,\r\n\nwhich charged importation of  cocaine, possession of cocaine with\r\n\nintent  to distribute,  and  use of  a communication  facility to\r\n\ncommit a drug crime, in violation of 21 U.S.C.    952, 841(a)(1),\r\n\nand 843(b),  respectively.  The district  court sentenced Flores-\r\n\nRivera to 324 months' imprisonment, to be followed by a five-year\r\n\nterm  of supervised release.  Flores-Rivera now appeals.  For the\r\n\nfollowing reasons, we affirm.\r\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We  recite the facts in the light most favorable to the\r\n\ngovernment.  United States  v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675,  676 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1993).  The focus of  this case was a large drug trafficking\r\n\nconspiracy.   The  conspirators, headed  by co-defendant  Eusebio\r\n\nEscobar-de Jes s (\"Escobar\"), worked with members of the Medell n\r\n\nand Cali drug cartels to import cocaine from Colombia into Puerto\r\n\nRico and New York.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          The linchpin witness for  the government's case against\r\n\nFlores-Rivera  was  William  Cedr s  (\"Cedr s\"),  a  confidential\r\n\ninformant.   Cedr s testified that he  infiltrated the conspiracy\r\n\nand gained the confidence of Escobar.  In 1990, Cedr s became the\r\n\n\"number  two man\"  in Escobar's  organization.   Cedr s testified\r\n\nthat  Escobar informed him that Flores-Rivera was a member of the\r\n\norganization.   Cedr s  also  testified  that  Flores-Rivera  had\r\n\naccompanied him to the island of  Vieques to look for sites where\r\n\nan airplane could land or drop-off kilogram quantities of cocaine\r\n\nin  the  future.   Cedr s  indicated that  the  conspirators were\r\n\nplanning  to use  the  new sites  to  import approximately  1,500\r\n\nkilograms  of cocaine.   The  Medell n cartel  was to  supply the\r\n\ncocaine, and the importation  was to be divided into four or five\r\n\nshipments.\r\n\n          Cedr s  also  testified  that  Escobar  had  instructed\r\n\nFlores-Rivera to supervise the importation of between 300 and 500\r\n\nkilograms  of  cocaine from  Colombia.    Flores-Rivera was  tape\r\n\nrecorded  discussing  the  importation  plans  with   Cedr s  and\r\n\nEscobar.    The tape  recording,  along  with Cedr s'  testimony,\r\n\nindicate that Flores-Rivera was to  travel to Colombia and return\r\n\nin a boat loaded with cocaine to one of Escobar's properties.\r\n\n          The  government  also  presented  evidence  of  Flores-\r\n\nRivera's involvement  in  the April  1986  shooting of  two  U.S.\r\n\nCustoms  agents.  Two witnesses testified that on April 14, 1986,\r\n\nthey saw Flores-Rivera arrive at the Isla Grande Flying School in\r\n\na yellow, flatbed  tanker-truck and purchase over 100  gallons of\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\naviation fuel.  Two U.S. Customs agents followed Flores-Rivera as\r\n\nhe  drove the  tanker-truck  from the  flying  school to  a  farm\r\n\nhousing a covert landing strip used by the  Escobar organization.\r\n\nFrom their surveillance post outside the farm, the Customs agents\r\n\nobserved Flores-Rivera and codefendant Andr s  Morales-Cruz enter\r\n\nthe  farm.   Later  that night,  the Customs  agents saw  a small\r\n\nairplane  land  at the  farm.   Shortly  thereafter,  the Customs\r\n\nagents witnessed an  unidentified man clad in army  fatigues exit\r\n\nthe farm in a white van.   The Customs agents followed.  When the\r\n\nvan got to a small curve in the road,  it stopped as if to make a\r\n\nU-turn.    As the  Customs agents  tried to  drive by,  the van's\r\n\noccupants  opened fire  on them,  severely injuring  both agents.\r\n\nThe agents were never able to identify the attackers.\r\n\n                         II.  DISCUSSION\r                                   II.  DISCUSSION\r\n\n          A.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\r                    A.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\r                                                   \r\n\n          Flores-Rivera   contends   that   the    evidence   was\r\n\ninsufficient  to  support  his  convictions  for  conspiracy  and\r\n\nassault on a federal officer.\r\n\n          The  standard of  review governing  a challenge  to the\r\n\nsufficiency of  the evidence is  well established.   An appellate\r\n\ncourt must  determine whether a  rational jury  could find  guilt\r\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.   Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 677;   United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v. Garc a, 983  F.2d 1160, 1163-64  (1st Cir. 1993).   In\r                           \r\n\nmaking this  determination, the reviewing court  must examine the\r\n\nevidence,  together with  all inferences  that may  be reasonably\r\n\ndrawn  from it, in the  light most favorable  to the prosecution.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nEcheverri,  982 F.2d  at 677.   Furthermore, the  reviewing court\r                   \r\n\ndoes  not   evaluate  witness   credibility,  but   resolves  all\r\n\ncredibility issues in favor of the verdict.   Garc a, 983 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n1164  (quoting United States v.  Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 17\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1991)).  \"The evidence may  be entirely circumstantial,\r\n\nand need  not exclude  every reasonable hypothesis  of innocence;\r\n\nthat   is,   the   factfinder   may   decide   among   reasonable\r\n\ninterpretations of  the evidence.\"  Batista-Polanco,  927 F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n17.  Nevertheless, \"[i]f  the 'evidence viewed in the  light most\r\n\nfavorable   to  the   verdict   gives  equal   or  nearly   equal\r\n\ncircumstantial  support  to a  theory of  guilt  and a  theory of\r\n\ninnocence  of the  crime  charged,' this  court must  reverse the\r\n\nconviction.  This  is so because .  . . where an  equal or nearly\r\n\nequal theory of guilt and  a theory of innocence is supported  by\r\n\nthe  evidence  viewed  in   the  light  most  favorable  to   the\r\n\nprosecution,  'a reasonable  jury  must  necessarily entertain  a\r                                                                        \r\n\nreasonable doubt.'\"   United  States v.

Conspiracy\r                      1.  Conspiracy\r\n\n          To establish a  conspiracy conviction, the  prosecution\r\n\nmust prove, inter alia, that  the defendant entered an  agreement\r                                \r\n\nto commit the substantive  offense, and that the defendant  was a\r\n\nvoluntary participant in the conspiracy.   Echeverri, 982 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n679.   The  government must  prove  that the  defendant possessed\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nboth  \"an intent  to  agree  and  an  intent  to  effectuate  the\r\n\ncommission of the substantive offense.\"   United States v. Piper,\r                                                                          \r\n\n35 F.3d 611,  615 (1st Cir. 1994), cert. denied,  115 S.

However,  \"[d]ue to the  clandestine nature of  criminal\r\n\nconspiracies, the  law recognizes that the  illegal agreement may\r\n\nbe either 'express or tacit' and that a '\"common purpose and plan\r\n\nmay   be  inferred   from  a   development  and   collocation  of\r\n\ncircumstance.\"'\"   United States  v. S nchez, 917  F.2d 607,  610\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1990)(citations omitted), cert. denied, 111 S. Ct. 1625\r                                                          \r\n\n(1991).  \"Mere presence  at the scene and close  association with\r\n\nthose involved are insufficient factors alone; nevertheless, they\r\n\nare relevant factors for  the jury.\"   S nchez, 961 F.2d at  1174\r                                                        \r\n\n(5th Cir.) (citation omitted).\r\n\n          Although  he  does not  dispute  the  existence of  the\r\n\nEscobar drug-trafficking conspiracy, Flores-Rivera maintains that\r\n\nthe evidence fails to establish that he was a member.  Given that\r\n\nwe resolve any  credibility issues  in favor of  the verdict,  we\r\n\nfind  that Flores-Rivera's  sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge\r\n\nfails  because   the  record  contains  ample   support  for  his\r\n\nconspiracy  conviction.    A  reasonable jury  could  infer  from\r\n\nCedr s' testimony  that Flores-Rivera was deeply  involved in the\r\n\nentire  operation.   Cedr s  testified that  Flores-Rivera was  a\r\n\nmember  of   the  Escobar  conspiracy,  and   that  Flores-Rivera\r\n\naccompanied  him to  Vieques  to search  for appropriate  landing\r\n\nsites for drug drop-offs.  Moreover, the evidence against Flores-\r\n\nRivera  includes a  tape-recorded  conversation in  which Flores-\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nRivera discusses importation plans with Escobar and Cedr s.   The\r\n\ntape recording also indicates that  Flores-Rivera agreed to go to\r\n\nColombia and  return in a boat  laden with cocaine.   In sum, the\r\n\nevidence demonstrates clearly and convincingly that Flores-Rivera\r\n\nwas  a knowing and voluntary  participant in many  aspects of the\r\n\nEscobar drug conspiracy.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n            2.  Assault on a federal agent\r                      2.

The  jury heard  the\r\n\nfollowing  facts:    On  April 14,  1986,  Flores-Rivera  brought\r\n\nairplane fuel to a  farm housing a covert landing  strip operated\r\n\nby the conspirators.   While the Customs  agents were surveilling\r\n\nthe farm, a  plane landed at the farm and,  shortly thereafter, a\r\n\nman  clad in army  fatigues exited in  a white van.   The Customs\r\n\nagents followed the van.  The van stopped as if to make a U-turn,\r\n\nand  as the Customs agents drove by,  they were fired upon by the\r\n\nvan's occupants.  In these circumstances, a reasonable jury could\r\n\nhave  found that  the shooting  was committed  by members  of the\r\n\nconspiracy, in  furtherance of the conspiracy,  and while Flores-\r\n\nRivera  was still a member of the conspiracy.  Therefore, we find\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nthat there was sufficient evidence to convict Flores-Rivera under\r\n\nPinkerton liability for assault on a federal officer.\r                   \r\n\n          Accordingly, we  reject both  of his challenges  to the\r\n\nsufficiency of the evidence.\r\n\n          B.

P. 14.1  We disagree.\r\n\n          The First Circuit law regarding severance is clear:\r\n\n            As  a  rule,  persons  who  are  indicted\r\n            together should be  tried together.  This\r\n            practice    helps    both   to    prevent\r\n            inconsistent  verdicts  and  to  conserve\r\n            resources   (judicial and prosecutorial).\r\n            Thus,  when    multiple  defendants   are\r\n            named in a single indictment, a defendant\r\n            who seeks a separate trial can ordinarily\r\n            succeed  in obtaining one  only by making\r\n            a  strong  showing of  evident prejudice.\r\n            The hurdle is intentionally  high; recent\r\n            Supreme Court precedent instructs that \"a\r\n            district court should  grant a  severance\r\n            under Rule 14 only  if there is a serious\r\n            risk that a joint trial  would compromise\r\n            a  specific  trial  right of  one  of the\r\n            defendants,  or  prevent  the  jury  from\r\n            making a reliable judgment about guilt or\r\n            innocence.\"\r\n\nUnited  States   v.

Brandon, 17 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n409,  440 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, Granoff v.

In support of this  contention, he points out\r\n\nthat he  was named in  less than  ten percent of  the of  all the\r\n\novert acts charged in the indictment and that his alleged role in\r\n\nthe  conspiracy   was  significantly   less  than  that   of  his\r\n\ncodefendants.  These facts, without more, do not render severance\r\n\nmandatory.  We rejected this argument in O'Bryant, stating:\r                                                           \r\n\n            To  be  sure,  there  is  some  truth  to\r\n            appellant's   complaint  that   a  minnow\r\n            (O'Bryant)  and a  kingfish (Puleo) stood\r\n            trial together.  It is also true that the\r\n            prosecution  drew  a  bead  on  Puleo and\r\n            aimed  most  of  its  ammunition  in  his\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n            direction.    But, these  truths, without\r\n            more,  did  not  necessitate  a  separate\r\n            trial for  O'Bryant.  It is  well settled\r\n            that,  \"[e]ven  where  large  amounts  of\r\n            testimony   are      irrelevant  to   one\r\n            defendant,   or  where   one  defendant's\r\n            involvement in an  overall  agreement  is\r\n            far less than the involvement of others,\"\r\n            the  court of appeals  must be \"reluctant\r\n            to second guess severance denials.\"  Such\r\n            reluctance is fully justified here.\r\n\nO'Bryant,  998  F.2d  at 26  (quoting  Boylan,  898  F.2d at  246\r                                                       \r\n\n(collecting cases)).\r\n\n          Moreover,  we  have held  that  \"'[i]n  the context  of\r\n\nconspiracy,  severance  will  rarely,  if  ever,  be  required.'\"\r\n\nBrandon,  17 F.3d at 440  (quoting United States  v.

In similar cases, we have held that where\r\n\nthe defendant failed  to raise a timely  objection, \"later doubts\r\n\nas to a juror's linguistic competence will not constitute grounds\r\n\nfor relief without a showing of 'manifest' or 'clear' injustice.\"\r\n\nUnited States v.

Flores-Rivera fails\r\nto identify  any statute or  caselaw requiring that  the district\r\ncourts conduct voir dire  entirely in English.  Moreover,  he has\r\nnot explained how he  was prejudiced by the bilingual  voir dire,\r\nespecially  in light  of  the fact  that  he requested  that  the\r                                                                \r\ndistrict court perform  its voir dire in Spanish.   Consequently,\r\nwe deem this argument waived.  See United States v.

We cannot\r\n            necessarily assume that the acquittal was\r\n            proper  --  the  one  the   jury  \"really\r\n            meant.\"  It is equally possible  that the\r\n            jury,   convinced   of  guilt,   properly\r\n            reached  its  conclusion on  one offense,\r\n            and then through mistake,  compromise, or\r\n            lenity,   arrived   at  an   inconsistent\r\n            conclusion on the other offense.

Specifically,\r\n\nFlores-Rivera claims that Agent Tejada misled the grand jury when\r\n\nhe testified (1) that the government's informant, William Cedr s,\r\n\nwas a businessman, (2)  that Cedr s had been arrested  only once,\r\n\nand  (3)  that  Cedr s   had  infiltrated  the  defendant's  drug\r\n\norganization  rather than  being  recruited  by authorities  from\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nwithin the organization and then \"flipping\" pursuant to a  formal\r\n\ncooperation agreement  with the prosecution.   The district court\r\n\naddressed these issues before trial and found them meritless.  In\r\n\nparticular, the district court found (1) that Cedr s was indeed a\r\n\nbusinessman,  (2) that at  the time of  Agent Tejada's testimony,\r\n\nthere was only one arrest listed in Cedr s' criminal history, and\r\n\n(3) that no evidence substantiated the allegation that Cedr s had\r\n\n\"flipped\" pursuant to a formal cooperation agreement.\r\n\n          In Bank of Nova  Scotia v.

An\r\n            indictment   returned    by   a   legally\r\n            constituted and unbiased  grand jury,  if\r\n            valid on its face,  is enough to call for\r\n            trial  of the  charge on  its merits.   A\r\n            court   should   not  inquire   into  the\r\n            sufficiency  of  the evidence  before the\r\n            indicting grand jury,  because the  grand\r\n            jury proceeding is  merely a  preliminary\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n            phase and  all constitutional protections\r\n            are afforded at trial.  Once a  defendant\r\n            has been  convicted by a petit  jury, the\r\n            petit jury's verdict  of guilty beyond  a\r\n            reasonable doubt  demonstrates a fortiori\r\n            that  there was probable  cause to charge\r\n            the  defendants  with  the  offenses  for\r\n            which  they  were  convicted.    At  that\r\n            point,   our  review   is  limited     to\r\n            determining if the district  court abused\r\n            its discretion in  failing to dismiss the\r\n            indictments.\r\n\nValencia-Lucena,  925  F.2d  at  511  (internal   quotations  and\r                         \r\n\ncitations omitted); cf.

Here, Flores-Rivera  was properly convicted\r\n\nby a petit jury after he and his codefendants were afforded ample\r\n\nopportunity to cross-examine Cedr s  at trial.  Moreover, Flores-\r\n\nRivera has not  demonstrated that the alleged misconduct  in fact\r\n\noccurred,  much  less  that  it was  prejudicial  or  outrageous.\r\n\nAccordingly, we find that  Flores-Rivera's proper conviction by a\r\n\npetit jury cures any alleged error before the grand jury.7\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7    Nevertheless,  we  repeat  our  prior  admonishment  against\r\ngovernment misconduct, this time  in the context of prosecutorial\r\nmisconduct before the grand jury:\r\n\n            Before  departing  from these  shores, we\r\n            pause to add a qualification:  the use of\r\n            supervisory    power   to    dismiss   an\r\n            indictment, in the  absence of injury  to\r\n            the defendant, may not be entirely a dead\r\n            letter.

Cedr s  did allude to the fact  that defendant\r\n\nEscobar  had  spent  time  in   prison.    Counsel  for   Escobar\r\n\nimmediately  objected  and demanded  a  mistrial.   Flores-Rivera\r\n\njoined  in this motion.  The court denied the defendants' motions\r\n\nfor mistrial,  issued curative  instructions, and  admonished the\r\n\ngovernment  to  keep  its  questions simple  to  avoid  eliciting\r\n\nfurther  improper  testimony.    Flores-Rivera insists  that  the\r\n\ncurative instructions were insufficient  and that the court erred\r\n\nin not granting a mistrial.  We disagree.\r\n\n          Generally, \"we  will presume  that juries can  and will\r\n\nfollow   instructions   to   disregard    inadmissible   evidence\r\n\ninadvertently  presented.\"   United States v.

Here, the risk  of prejudice  to Flores-\r\n\nRivera  was  slim  because  Cedr s alluded  only  to  codefendant\r\n\nEscobar's prison time; Cedr s did not indicate that Flores-Rivera\r\n\nhad also served prison time.  Moreover, the district court issued\r\n\na  timely and  forceful  curative instruction,  to which  neither\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nFlores-Rivera nor Escobar objected.8   Accordingly, we affirm the\r\n\ndistrict court's refusal to grant a mistrial.\r\n\n            2.  Pre-conspiracy evidence:\r                      2.  Pre-conspiracy evidence:\r\n\n          Flores-Rivera  also  contends that  the  district court\r\n\nerred  in   admitting  evidence  that  drugs   were  imported  by\r\n\ncodefendants Escobar  and Santos-Caraballo in March  of 1986, one\r\n\nmonth  before the  start of  the conspiracy  alleged in  Count 2.\r\n\nFlores-Rivera notes  correctly that  the evidence  was admissible\r\n\nagainst  his codefendants, but not  against him.   He argues that\r\n\nthe  court's  instruction to  this  effect  was insufficient  and\r\n\nconfusing.   This contention has little merit and can be disposed\r\n\nof quickly.\r\n\n          To prevent  prejudice  to  the  other  defendants,  the\r\n\ndistrict court  issued an  extensive limiting instruction  to the\r\n\njury, which included the admonishment:\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8  The curative instruction states, in pertinent part:\r\n\n            . . .

They\r\n            are  not involved  in  that.   So if  you\r\n            consider this evidence, it  pertains only\r\n            to those two defendants.\r\n\nThis instruction clearly instructed  the jury that it was  not to\r\n\nconsider  the  pre-conspiracy  evidence   against  Flores-Rivera.\r\n\nAccordingly,   we  reject  Flores-Rivera's  contention  that  the\r\n\nadmission of this evidence constituted reversible error. \r\n\n            3.  Statements of co-conspirators:\r                      3.  Statements of co-conspirators:\r\n\n          Flores-Rivera  also  contends that  the  district court\r\n\nmisapplied the  co-conspirator exclusion to the  hearsay rule and\r\n\nthus clearly  erred when it admitted  the out-of-court statements\r\n\nof codefendant  Escobar.

The evidence\r                         \r\n\nshows that Escobar intended to make Cedr s \"the number two man in\r\n\nhis organization.\"  Clearly, such a person would need to know the\r\n\nidentities of the  players in the organization, and statements to\r\n\nthis end are  certainly in  furtherance of the  conspiracy.   Cf.\r                                                                           \r\n\nSep lveda,  15 F.3d  at  1180  (explaining  that  \"it  is  common\r                   \r\n\nground--and  common sense--that  the  reporting   of  significant\r\n\nevents   by   one   coconspirator   to   another   advances   the\r\n\nconspiracy\")(citing  United States  v.

Identification testimony:\r                      4.  Identification testimony:\r\n\n          Lastly,  Flores-Rivera contends that  he was prejudiced\r\n\nby the  government's use  of photo  spreads  that were  allegedly\r\n\nimpermissibly  suggestive.   Although  his brief  is unclear,  he\r\n\nappears  to argue that the  photo spreads shown  to two witnesses\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nwere so  impermissibly suggestive  as to render  their subsequent\r\n\nin-court identifications unreliable and inadmissible.\r\n\n          The framework for our appellate review is well settled.\r\n\n            The   Supreme   Court,   in   Manson   v.\r                                                          \r\n            Brathwaite, concluded that reliability is\r                                \r\n            the    \"linchpin\"    in   deciding    the\r\n            admissibility      of      identification\r\n            testimony.  The Court  directed attention\r\n            to  the  factors  indicating  reliability\r\n            previously  set out  in Neil  v.

Guzm n-Rivera, 990 F.2d 681,  683 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. (1993).\r\n\n          Here, Flores-Rivera has not demonstrated  how the photo\r\n\nspreads  were impermissably suggestive,  except to aver generally\r\n\nthat Flores-Rivera has different facial characteristics than  the\r\n\nother  persons featured in the display.  The district court judge\r\n\nrejected  this same  averment  at trial,  stating that  the photo\r\n\nspreads were among  the fairest he had  seen.  Moreover, even  if\r\n\nthe  photo   spreads  had  been  impermissibly   suggestive,  the\r\n\ncircumstances    indicate    that    the   subsequent    in-court\r\n\nidentifications were reliable.\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\n          Two  witnesses testified  that  they  had seen  Flores-\r\n\nRivera purchase aviation fuel at the Isla Grande Flying School on\r\n\nApril 14, 1986,  the  day  that  the Customs  agents  were  shot.\r\n\nAwilda Torres de Reyes, the owner of the flying school, testified\r\n\nthat  Flores-Rivera had  arrived  in a  flatbed tanker-truck  and\r\n\npurchased over 100 gallons  of aviation fuel, an unusually  large\r\n\namount.  She stated that it required between one and two hours to\r\n\ncomplete  the transaction, thus giving her ample time to view the\r\n\ndefendant.  She  testified further that the  transaction stuck in\r\n\nher mind  because the defendant had purchased  an unusually large\r\n\namount  of fuel,  and that  she suspected  that the  purchase was\r\n\nconnected to a drug trafficking scheme because she knew that drug\r\n\ntraffickers often  required large  quantities  of aviation  fuel.\r\n\nShe indicated  that the  transaction became especially  memorable\r\n\nthe  following day when she read that two U.S. Customs agents had\r\n\nbeen shot while investigating a narcotics  operation.  She called\r\n\nthe  Customs office  and  informed  them  that  she  had  sold  a\r\n\nsuspiciously large quantity of  aviation fuel on the same  day as\r\n\nthe shooting, and that  she thought that the two  incidents might\r\n\nbe connected.  The second witness who identified Flores-Rivera as\r\n\nthe April  14  fuel-purchaser  was  Ra l Jim nez,  who  was  then\r\n\nworking as a pilot for the Puerto Rico Department of Justice.  He\r\n\ntestified that the incident  was memorable to him because  he was\r\n\nforced to wait for  over an hour while Flores-Rivera  was filling\r\n\nthe tanks on the flatbed truck.  Mr.  Jim nez also indicated that\r\n\nhe  contacted Customs agents after he heard rumors that a flatbed\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\ntanker truck had  been involved  in the shooting  of two  Customs\r\n\nagents  on  the night  of the  fuel  purchase.   Accordingly, the\r\n\ncircumstances indicate  that the attention of  both witnesses was\r\n\nsufficiently focused on  Flores-Rivera, both at  the time of  the\r\n\nviewing and shortly thereafter.\r\n\n          At trial, both witnesses evinced certainty that Flores-\r\n\nRivera  was  in  fact the  April  14  fuel-purchaser.   The  only\r\n\ntroubling factor  is that their in-court  identifications did not\r\n\noccur until  February 23,  1993, nearly  seven years  after their\r\n\ninitial viewing at the flying school.  Nevertheless, we find that\r\n\nthe  other reliability criteria  were sufficiently  persuasive to\r\n\novercome any unreliability engendered by the delay.  Accordingly,\r\n\nthe district court  did not err  in admitting the  identification\r\n\nevidence.\r\n\n          G.  Sentencing challenge\r                    G.  Sentencing challenge\r                                            \r\n\n          Flores-Rivera   contends   that   the  district   court\r\n\nimproperly determined his appropriate base offense level (\"BOL\").\r\n\nThe district court determined Flores-Rivera's  BOL to be 40 after\r\n\nit  concluded that between 500 and 1500 kilograms of cocaine were\r\n\nattributable to  Flores-Rivera  for  sentencing  purposes.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nU.S.S.G.   2D1.1(c)(2).  Flores-Rivera contends that the evidence\r\n\ndoes not support this conclusion.\r\n\n          The  determinative  factor  for  sentencing  under  the\r\n\nguidelines  is the quantity of drugs.   United States v. Reyes, 3\r                                                                        \r\n\nF.3d 29,  31 (1st Cir.  1993).  That  quantity is the sum  of the\r\n\ncharged  conduct  for  which  defendant  is  convicted  plus  his\r\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\n\"relevant\" uncharged conduct.  United States v.

In the  case  of jointly  undertaken\r\n\ncriminal  activity -- whether or  not charged as  a conspiracy --\r\n\nrelevant conduct includes all  acts reasonably foreseeable by the\r\n\ndefendant and committed in  furtherance of the jointly undertaken\r\n\nactivity.   U.S.S.G.    1B1.3, comment.  (n.1); United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nCastellone, 985 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir.  1993); Garc a, 954 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n15.   To include disputed  transactions as relevant  conduct, the\r\n\ngovernment  must  prove by  a   preponderance  of the  evidence a\r\n\nsufficient  nexus  between  the conduct  underlying  the disputed\r\n\ntransaction and the offense  of conviction.  See Castellone,  985\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d  at 24; United States v.

We accord considerable deference to the district court's\r\n\ndetermination of whether  a given drug transaction  forms part of\r\n\nthe  same course of conduct  as counts of  conviction and, absent\r\n\nmistake  of law,  will  set aside  its  finding only  if  clearly\r\n\nerroneous.  Castellone, 985 F.2d at 24; Garc a, 954 F.2d at 15.\r                                                        \r\n\n          Here,   the  evidence  clearly  supports  the  district\r\n\ncourt's  conclusion  that  between  500 and  1,500  kilograms  of\r\n\ncocaine  were   attributable  to  Flores-Rivera   for  sentencing\r\n\npurposes.  Cedr s testified that Escobar ordered Flores-Rivera to\r\n\nsupervise the  importation of  between 300 and  500 kilograms  of\r\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\ncocaine from Colombia.  The district court could reasonably  have\r\n\nattributed   this  quantity   to  Flores-Rivera   for  sentencing\r\n\npurposes,  and  Flores-Rivera  concedes  as much.    Cedr s  also\r\n\ntestified that the Escobar  Organization was conspiring to import\r\n\napproximately  1,500  kilograms  of  cocaine  from  Colombia  for\r\n\ndistribution in New York,  and that Flores-Rivera had accompanied\r\n\nCedr s  to look  for appropriate  \"drop zones\"  on the  island of\r\n\nVieques.   From  this evidence,  the  district court  could  have\r\n\nreasonably concluded  that there  was a sufficient  nexus between\r\n\nFlores-Rivera's conspiracy conviction and the importation efforts\r\n\nof  the other  members  of the  conspiracy  to attribute  to  him\r\n\nbetween  500  and  1500   kilograms  of  cocaine  for  sentencing\r\n\npurposes.   Accordingly, we find no error in the district court's\r\n\ndetermination of Flores-Rivera's BOL.\r\n\n          We have  considered the other issues  raised by Flores-\r\n\nRivera and find them to be similarly meritless.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                            \r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n",

On April 14, 1993, a jury convicted Flores-Rivera on one count of conspiracy to import cocaine and to possess cocaine with intent to distribute it, in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 846 and 963 (Count 2), and two counts of assaulting a federal officer with a deadly weapon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 111, (Counts 5 and 6).  The jury acquitted Flores-Rivera on Counts 3, 4, and 34, which charged importation of cocaine, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and use of a communication facility to commit a drug crime, in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 952, 841(a)(1), and 843(b), respectively.  The district court sentenced Flores-Rivera to 324 months' imprisonment, to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release.  Flores-Rivera now appeals.  For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the government.  United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 676 (1st Cir.1993).  The focus of this case was a large drug trafficking conspiracy.  The conspirators, headed by co-defendant Eusebio Escobar-de Jesus (\"Escobar\"), worked with members of the Medellin and Cali drug cartels to import cocaine from Colombia into Puerto Rico and New York.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The linchpin witness for the government's case against Flores-Rivera was William Cedres (\"Cedres\"), a confidential informant.  Cedres testified that he infiltrated the conspiracy and gained the confidence of Escobar.  In 1990, Cedres became the \"number two man\" in Escobar's organization.  Cedres testified that Escobar informed him that Flores-Rivera was a member of the organization.  Cedres also testified that Flores-Rivera had accompanied him to the island of Vieques to look for sites where an airplane could land or drop-off kilogram quantities of cocaine in the future.  Cedres indicated that the conspirators were planning to use the new sites to import approximately 1,500 kilograms of cocaine.  The Medellin cartel was to supply the cocaine, and the importation was to be divided into four or five shipments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cedres also testified that Escobar had instructed Flores-Rivera to supervise the importation of between 300 and 500 kilograms of cocaine from Colombia.  Flores-Rivera was tape recorded discussing the importation plans with Cedres and Escobar.  The tape recording, along with Cedres' testimony, indicate that Flores-Rivera was to travel to Colombia and return in a boat loaded with cocaine to one of Escobar's properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also presented evidence of Flores-Rivera's involvement in the April 1986 shooting of two U.S. Customs agents.  Two witnesses testified that on April 14, 1986, they saw Flores-Rivera arrive at the Isla Grande Flying School in a yellow, flatbed tanker-truck and purchase over 100 gallons of aviation fuel.  Two U.S. Customs agents followed Flores-Rivera as he drove the tanker-truck from the flying school to a farm housing a covert landing strip used by the Escobar organization.  From their surveillance post outside the farm, the Customs agents observed Flores-Rivera and codefendant Andres Morales-Cruz enter the farm.  Later that night, the Customs agents saw a small airplane land at the farm.  Shortly thereafter, the Customs agents witnessed an unidentified man clad in army fatigues exit the farm in a white van.  The Customs agents followed.  When the van got to a small curve in the road, it stopped as if to make a U-turn.  As the Customs agents tried to drive by, the van's occupants opened fire on them, severely injuring both agents.  The agents were never able to identify the attackers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores-Rivera contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions for conspiracy and assault on a federal officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard of review governing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is well established.  An appellate court must determine whether a rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 677;  United States v. Garcia, 983 F.2d 1160, 1163-64 (1st Cir.1993).  In making this determination, the reviewing court must examine the evidence, together with all inferences that may be reasonably drawn from it, in the light most favorable to the prosecution.  Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 677.   Furthermore, the reviewing court does not evaluate witness credibility, but resolves all credibility issues in favor of the verdict.  Garcia, 983 F.2d at 1164 (quoting United States v. Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir.1991)).  \"The evidence may be entirely circumstantial, and need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence;  that is, the factfinder may decide among reasonable interpretations of the evidence.\"  Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d at 17.   Nevertheless, \"[i]f the 'evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict gives equal or nearly equal circumstantial support to a theory of guilt and a theory of innocence of the crime charged,' this court must reverse the conviction.  This is so because ... where an equal or nearly equal theory of guilt and a theory of innocence is supported by the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, 'a reasonable jury must necessarily entertain a reasonable doubt.' \"  United States v. Sanchez, 961 F.2d 1169, 1173 (5th Cir.)  (citations omitted), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 330, 121 L.Ed.2d 248 (1992).  With the scope of our review thus defined, we move to the appellants' claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Conspiracy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish a conspiracy conviction, the prosecution must prove, inter alia, that the defendant entered an agreement to commit the substantive offense, and that the defendant was a voluntary participant in the conspiracy.  Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 679.   The government must prove that the defendant possessed both \"an intent to agree and an intent to effectuate the commission of the substantive offense.\"  United States v. Piper, 35 F.3d 611, 615 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1118, 130 L.Ed.2d 1082 (1995).  However, \"[d]ue to the clandestine nature of criminal conspiracies, the law recognizes that the illegal agreement may be either 'express or tacit' and that a ' \"common purpose and plan may be inferred from a development and collocation of circumstance.\" ' \"  United States v.

Given that we resolve any credibility issues in favor of the verdict, we find that Flores-Rivera's sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge fails because the record contains ample support for his conspiracy conviction.  A reasonable jury could infer from Cedres' testimony that Flores-Rivera was deeply involved in the entire operation.  Cedres testified that Flores-Rivera was a member of the Escobar conspiracy, and that Flores-Rivera accompanied him to Vieques to search for appropriate landing sites for drug drop-offs.  Moreover, the evidence against Flores-Rivera includes a tape-recorded conversation in which Flores-Rivera discusses importation plans with Escobar and Cedres.  The tape recording also indicates that Flores-Rivera agreed to go to Colombia and return in a boat laden with cocaine.  In sum, the evidence demonstrates clearly and convincingly that Flores-Rivera was a knowing and voluntary participant in many aspects of the Escobar drug conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Assault on a federal agent</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the well settled Pinkerton doctrine, members of a conspiracy may be held liable for the substantive crimes committed by co-conspirators, provided that the substantive crimes were committed in furtherance of the conspiracy and while the defendant was a member of the conspiracy.  See Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 646-48, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 1183-84, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946);  United States v. Torres-Maldonado, 14 F.3d 95, 101 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 193, 130 L.Ed.2d 125 (1994).  Under Pinkerton, the government was required to prove that the April 14, 1986, assault on the U.S. Customs agents was carried out by members of the Escobar conspiracy, in furtherance of the conspiracy, and at a time when Flores-Rivera was still a member of the conspiracy.  United States v. Munoz, 36 F.3d 1229, 1234 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1164, 130 L.Ed.2d 1120 (1995).  We think it met this burden.  The jury heard the following facts:  On April 14, 1986, Flores-Rivera brought airplane fuel to a farm housing a covert landing strip operated by the conspirators.  While the Customs agents were surveilling the farm, a plane landed at the farm and, shortly thereafter, a man clad in army fatigues exited in a white van.  The Customs agents followed the van.  The van stopped as if to make a U-turn, and as the Customs agents drove by, they were fired upon by the van's occupants.  In these circumstances, a reasonable jury could have found that the shooting was committed by members of the conspiracy, in furtherance of the conspiracy, and while Flores-Rivera was still a member of the conspiracy.  Therefore, we find that there was sufficient evidence to convict Flores-Rivera under Pinkerton liability for assault on a federal officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject both of his challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Separate Trials</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores-Rivera alleges that the district court erroneously denied his Rule 14 motion for severance.

This practice helps both to prevent inconsistent verdicts and to conserve resources (judicial and prosecutorial).  Thus, when multiple defendants are named in a single indictment, a defendant who seeks a separate trial can ordinarily succeed in obtaining one only by making a strong showing of evident prejudice.  The hurdle is intentionally high;  recent Supreme Court precedent instructs that \"a district court should grant a severance under Rule 14 only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

That is, Flores-Rivera claims that the joint trial \"seriously limited the jury's ability to sift through all the evidence against each individual defendant and increased the risk that the jury would base its verdicts on evidence which has no bearing on the guilt or innocence of defendants with a more limited involvement in the scheme.\"  United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 440 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, Granoff v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 80, 130 L.Ed.2d 34 (1994).  In support of this contention, he points out that he was named in less than ten percent of all the overt acts charged in the indictment and that his alleged role in the conspiracy was significantly less than that of his codefendants.  These facts, without more, do not render severance mandatory.  We rejected this argument in O'Bryant, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>To be sure, there is some truth to appellant's complaint that a minnow (O'Bryant) and a kingfish (Puleo) stood trial together.  It is also true that the prosecution drew a bead on Puleo and aimed most of its ammunition in his direction.  But, these truths, without more, did not necessitate a separate trial for O'Bryant.  It is well settled that, \"[e]ven where large amounts of testimony are irrelevant to one defendant, or where one defendant's involvement in an overall agreement is far less than the involvement of others,\" the court of appeals must be \"reluctant to second guess severance denials.\"   Such reluctance is fully justified here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Bryant, 998 F.2d at 26 (quoting Boylan, 898 F.2d at 246 (collecting cases)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we have held that \" '[i]n the context of conspiracy, severance will rarely, if ever, be required.' \"  Brandon, 17 F.3d at 440 (quoting United States v. Searing, 984 F.2d 960, 965 (8th Cir.1993));  see also O'Bryant, 998 F.2d at 24-26.   To convict any of the defendants under a conspiracy theory, the government had to show the existence of an illicit scheme to import and distribute cocaine;  and because Flores-Rivera and his codefendants were charged as coconspirators, virtually all the evidence relating to the other conspirators was also directly relevant to, and, therefore, independently admissible in, the prosecution's case against him.  See O'Bryant, 998 F.2d at 26 (citing United States v. Riehl, 460 F.2d 454, 457-58 (3d Cir.1972)).  And as we have held, \"[w]here evidence featuring one defendant is independently admissible against a codefendant, the latter cannot convincingly complain of an improper spillover effect.\"  Id. (collecting cases).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Accordingly, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant Flores-Rivera's motion for severance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Jury Selection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant asserts two claims regarding jury selection.  First, he contends that the \"English only\" requirement of the jury selection system violates his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights because it effectively excludes two-thirds of the population of Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  This argument is foreclosed by our decision in United States v. Aponte-Suarez, in which we held that even if the English-only requirement \"[results] in a smaller pool of eligible jurors and a 'systematic exclusion' in the jury selection process, the overwhelming national interest served by the use of English in a United States court justifies conducting proceedings in the District of Puerto Rico in English and requiring jurors to be proficient in that language.\"  905 F.2d 483, 492 (1st Cir.)  (citing United States v. Benmuhar, 658 F.2d 14, 19 (1st Cir.1981), cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1117, 102 S.Ct. 2927, 73 L.Ed.2d 1328 (1982)), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 990, 111 S.Ct. 531, 112 L.Ed.2d 541 (1990).  Accordingly, we reject this contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Flores-Rivera maintains that the district court did not adequately inquire whether the jurors could speak and understand English as required by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1865(b)(2) &amp; (3), and that \"[p]resumably, there were many ... jurors who actually sat on this case who may not have comprehended English.\"   We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. Sec. 1865(b) requires that jurors be dismissed if they cannot demonstrate a minimum proficiency in English.  28 U.S.C. Sec. 1867 sets forth the proper procedure for challenging the district court's compliance with selection procedures, and requires that the defendant make an appropriate challenge within seven days \"after the defendant discovered or could have discovered, by the exercise of diligence, ... substantial failure to comply with the provisions of this title in selecting the grand or petit jury.\"   Here, Flores-Rivera did not challenge the English proficiency of the empaneled jurors within the prescribed time frame.  In similar cases, we have held that where the defendant failed to raise a timely objection, \"later doubts as to a juror's linguistic competence will not constitute grounds for relief without a showing of 'manifest' or 'clear' injustice.\"  United States v. Nickens, 955 F.2d 112, 117 (1st Cir.)  (collecting cases), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 108, 121 L.Ed.2d 66 (1992).  Flores-Rivera has shown no such injustice.  In fact, his bald assertion that \"presumably, there were many ... jurors who actually sat on this case who may not have comprehended English\" is unaccompanied by any support whatsoever.  Accordingly, we reject his challenge to the empaneled jury, not only because it was untimely, but also because it is devoid of factual support.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Double Jeopardy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores-Rivera maintains that his conviction for conspiracy to import cocaine and to possess cocaine with intent to distribute cannot stand because it is inconsistent with his acquittal on the substantive crimes charged in the indictment (importation of cocaine, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and use of a telephone to facilitate the importation of cocaine).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We have addressed similar claims before and found them unavailing.  See, e.g., United States v. Gonzales-Torres, 980 F.2d 788 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d 33, 41 (1st Cir.1991).  \"It is well settled that inconsistency in a criminal verdict does not require setting the verdict aside.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Gonzales-Torres, 980 F.2d at 791 (citing Dunn v. United States, 284 U.S. 390, 393-94, 52 S.Ct. 189, 190-91, 76 L.Ed. 356 (1932);  United States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57, 69, 105 S.Ct. 471, 479, 83 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984);  United States v. Bucuvalas, 909 F.2d 593 (1st Cir.1990)).  As we explained in Lopez:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>Although it may seem inconsistent in this case to convict on the conspiracy charge, and acquit the same defendant on the substantive charge alleged to have been the object of the conspiracy, the Supreme Court has made it clear that verdict inconsistency in itself is not a sufficient basis for vacating a conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verdict inconsistency does not indicate that the government necessarily failed to prove an essential element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  We cannot necessarily assume that the acquittal was proper--the one the jury \"really meant.\"   It is equally possible that the jury, convinced of guilt, properly reached its conclusion on one offense, and then through mistake, compromise, or lenity, arrived at an inconsistent conclusion on the other offense.  As long as the trial and appellate courts are convinced on independent review that there was sufficient evidence to sustain a rational verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant is properly protected against any risk of injustice resulting from \"jury irrationality.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez, 944 F.2d at 41 (discussing Powell, 469 U.S. 57, 105 S.Ct. 471, 83 L.Ed.2d 461) (internal quotations omitted).  Accordingly, because we found that Flores-Rivera's conspiracy conviction is supported by sufficient evidence, it must stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores-Rivera claims that Agent Tejada's grand jury testimony was replete with perjury, that the government either cooperated with Agent Tejada or was negligent in allowing him to testify falsely, that this prosecutorial misconduct rose to the level of a due process violation, and that, therefore, the various indictments against him must be dismissed.  Specifically, Flores-Rivera claims that Agent Tejada misled the grand jury when he testified (1) that the government's informant, William Cedres, was a businessman, (2) that Cedres had been arrested only once, and (3) that Cedres had infiltrated the defendant's drug organization rather than being recruited by authorities from within the organization and then \"flipping\" pursuant to a formal cooperation agreement with the prosecution.  The district court addressed these issues before trial and found them meritless.  In particular, the district court found (1) that Cedres was indeed a businessman, (2) that at the time of Agent Tejada's testimony, there was only one arrest listed in Cedres' criminal history, and (3) that no evidence substantiated the allegation that Cedres had \"flipped\" pursuant to a formal cooperation agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U.S. 250, 108 S.Ct. 2369, 101 L.Ed.2d 228 (1988), the Court provided the applicable standard for determining when errors before the grand jury warrant dismissal of an indictment:  \"[A]s a general matter, a district court may not dismiss an indictment for errors in grand jury proceedings unless such errors prejudiced the defendants.\"  Id. at 254, 108 S.Ct. at 2373;  see also United States v. Latorre, 922 F.2d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 876, 112 S.Ct. 217, 116 L.Ed.2d 175 (1991).  As we explained in United States v. Valencia-Lucena, 925 F.2d 506, 511 (1st Cir.1991), errors before the grand jury will often be deemed harmless if the defendants were subsequently and properly convicted before an impartial petit jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>[T]he fact that the defendants were convicted by a petit jury acts as a cure for any error which may have resulted during grand jury proceedings.  An indictment returned by a legally constituted and unbiased grand jury, if valid on its face, is enough to call for trial of the charge on its merits.  A court should not inquire into the sufficiency of the evidence before the indicting grand jury, because the grand jury proceeding is merely a preliminary phase and all constitutional protections are afforded at trial.  Once a defendant has been convicted by a petit jury, the petit jury's verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt demonstrates a fortiori that there was probable cause to charge the defendants with the offenses for which they were convicted.  At that point, our review is limited to determining if the district court abused its discretion in failing to dismiss the indictments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valencia-Lucena, 925 F.2d at 511 (internal quotations and citations omitted);  cf. United States v. Osorio, 929 F.2d 753, 763 (1st Cir.1991).  Here, Flores-Rivera was properly convicted by a petit jury after he and his codefendants were afforded ample opportunity to cross-examine Cedres at trial.  Moreover, Flores-Rivera has not demonstrated that the alleged misconduct in fact occurred, much less that it was prejudicial or outrageous.  Accordingly, we find that Flores-Rivera's proper conviction by a petit jury cures any alleged error before the grand jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. Evidentiary Matters</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores-Rivera maintains that his trial was marred by four evidentiary errors, and that each constitutes reversible error.  We address his contentions in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. \"Other crimes\" evidence:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores-Rivera's first contends that the prosecutor improperly elicited inadmissible evidence of \"other crimes\" from informant Cedres.  Cedres did allude to the fact that defendant Escobar had spent time in prison.  Counsel for Escobar immediately objected and demanded a mistrial.  Flores-Rivera joined in this motion.  The court denied the defendants' motions for mistrial, issued curative instructions, and admonished the government to keep its questions simple to avoid eliciting further improper testimony.  Flores-Rivera insists that the curative instructions were insufficient and that the court erred in not granting a mistrial.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, \"we will presume that juries can and will follow instructions to disregard inadmissible evidence inadvertently presented.\"  United States v. Martinez, 922 F.2d 914 (1st Cir.1991) (citing United States v. Paiva, 892 F.2d 148, 160 (1st Cir.1989)).  Here, the risk of prejudice to Flores-Rivera was slim because Cedres alluded only to codefendant Escobar's prison time;  Cedres did not indicate that Flores-Rivera had also served prison time.  Moreover, the district court issued a timely and forceful curative instruction, to which neither Flores-Rivera nor Escobar objected.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Accordingly, we affirm the district court's refusal to grant a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Pre-conspiracy evidence:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores-Rivera also contends that the district court erred in admitting evidence that drugs were imported by codefendants Escobar and Santos-Caraballo in March of 1986, one month before the start of the conspiracy alleged in Count 2.  Flores-Rivera notes correctly that the evidence was admissible against his codefendants, but not against him.  He argues that the court's instruction to this effect was insufficient and confusing.  This contention has little merit and can be disposed of quickly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevent prejudice to the other defendants, the district court issued an extensive limiting instruction to the jury, which included the admonishment:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>[T]his evidence will only be considered by you in reference to defendants [Escobar] and [Santos-Caraballo].  This evidence only relates to them.  It doesn't relate at all whatsoever to Michael Cruz-Gonzalez, to Eric Flores-Rivera or to Andres Morales-Cruz.  They are not involved in that.  So if you consider this evidence, it pertains only to those two defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This instruction clearly instructed the jury that it was not to consider the pre-conspiracy evidence against Flores-Rivera.  Accordingly, we reject Flores-Rivera's contention that the admission of this evidence constituted reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Statements of co-conspirators:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores-Rivera also contends that the district court misapplied the co-conspirator exclusion to the hearsay rule and thus clearly erred when it admitted the out-of-court statements of codefendant Escobar.  Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E) excludes from the operation of the hearsay rule \"a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).  \"To invoke the exception, a party who wants to introduce a particular statement must show by a preponderance of the evidence that a conspiracy embracing both the declarant and the defendant existed, and that the declarant uttered the statement during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"  United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1180 (1993) (1st Cir.)  (citing Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 175-76, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 2778-79, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987);  United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 714-15 (1st Cir.1992)), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2714, 129 L.Ed.2d 840 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the informant, Cedres, testified that Escobar had told him that Flores-Rivera was a member of the narcotics conspiracy.  Flores-Rivera contends that this statement was improperly admitted under the co-conspirator exclusion because it was not made in furtherance of the conspiracy.  We disagree.  As we have often explained, a damaging statement is admissible under 801(d)(2)(E) if it \"tends to advance the objects of the conspiracy as opposed to thwarting its purpose.\"  United States v. Fahey, 769 F.2d 829, 839 (1st Cir.1985);  see also United States v. Masse, 816 F.2d 805, 811 (1st Cir.1987).  The evidence shows that Escobar intended to make Cedres \"the number two man in his organization.\"   Clearly, such a person would need to know the identities of the players in the organization, and statements to this end are certainly in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Cf. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1180 (explaining that \"it is common ground--and common sense--that the reporting of significant events by one coconspirator to another advances the conspiracy\") (citing United States v. Smith, 833 F.2d 213, 219 (10th Cir.1987)).

The Court directed attention to the factors indicating reliability previously set out in Neil v. Biggers, [including] the opportunity for the witness to view the defendant at the time of the crime, the witness's degree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description, the level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the time between the crime and the confrontation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

The district court judge rejected this same averment at trial, stating that the photo spreads were among the fairest he had seen.  Moreover, even if the photo spreads had been impermissibly suggestive, the circumstances indicate that the subsequent in-court identifications were reliable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two witnesses testified that they had seen Flores-Rivera purchase aviation fuel at the Isla Grande Flying School on April 14, 1986, the day that the Customs agents were shot.  Awilda Torres de Reyes, the owner of the flying school, testified that Flores-Rivera had arrived in a flatbed tanker-truck and purchased over 100 gallons of aviation fuel, an unusually large amount.  She stated that it required between one and two hours to complete the transaction, thus giving her ample time to view the defendant.  She testified further that the transaction stuck in her mind because the defendant had purchased an unusually large amount of fuel, and that she suspected that the purchase was connected to a drug trafficking scheme because she knew that drug traffickers often required large quantities of aviation fuel.  She indicated that the transaction became especially memorable the following day when she read that two U.S. Customs agents had been shot while investigating a narcotics operation.  She called the Customs office and informed them that she had sold a suspiciously large quantity of aviation fuel on the same day as the shooting, and that she thought that the two incidents might be connected.  The second witness who identified Flores-Rivera as the April 14 fuel-purchaser was Raul Jimenez, who was then working as a pilot for the Puerto Rico Department of Justice.  He testified that the incident was memorable to him because he was forced to wait for over an hour while Flores-Rivera was filling the tanks on the flatbed truck.  Mr. Jimenez also indicated that he contacted Customs agents after he heard rumors that a flatbed tanker truck had been involved in the shooting of two Customs agents on the night of the fuel purchase.  Accordingly, the circumstances indicate that the attention of both witnesses was sufficiently focused on Flores-Rivera, both at the time of the viewing and shortly thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, both witnesses evinced certainty that Flores-Rivera was in fact the April 14 fuel-purchaser.  The only troubling factor is that their in-court identifications did not occur until February 23, 1993, nearly seven years after their initial viewing at the flying school.  Nevertheless, we find that the other reliability criteria were sufficiently persuasive to overcome any unreliability engendered by the delay.  Accordingly, the district court did not err in admitting the identification evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">G. Sentencing Challenge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores-Rivera contends that the district court improperly determined his appropriate base offense level (\"BOL\").  The district court determined Flores-Rivera's BOL to be 40 after it concluded that between 500 and 1500 kilograms of cocaine were attributable to Flores-Rivera for sentencing purposes.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(c)(2).  Flores-Rivera contends that the evidence does not support this conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The determinative factor for sentencing under the guidelines is the quantity of drugs.  United States v. Reyes, 3 F.3d 29, 31 (1st Cir.1993).  That quantity is the sum of the charged conduct for which defendant is convicted plus his \"relevant\" uncharged conduct.  United States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d 601, 604 (1st Cir.1990).  \"The drug quantity is to be derived from all acts 'that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.' \"  United States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12, 15 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(2)).  In the case of jointly undertaken criminal activity--whether or not charged as a conspiracy--relevant conduct includes all acts reasonably foreseeable by the defendant and committed in furtherance of the jointly undertaken activity.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3, comment.  (n.1);  United States v. Castellone, 985 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir.1993);  Garcia, 954 F.2d at 15.   To include disputed transactions as relevant conduct, the government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence a sufficient nexus between the conduct underlying the disputed transaction and the offense of conviction.  See Castellone, 985 F.2d at 24;  United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 110 (1st Cir.1990).  We accord considerable deference to the district court's determination of whether a given drug transaction forms part of the same course of conduct as counts of conviction and, absent mistake of law, will set aside its finding only if clearly erroneous.  Castellone, 985 F.2d at 24;  Garcia, 954 F.2d at 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the evidence clearly supports the district court's conclusion that between 500 and 1,500 kilograms of cocaine were attributable to Flores-Rivera for sentencing purposes.  Cedres testified that Escobar ordered Flores-Rivera to supervise the importation of between 300 and 500 kilograms of cocaine from Colombia.  The district court could reasonably have attributed this quantity to Flores-Rivera for sentencing purposes, and Flores-Rivera concedes as much.  Cedres also testified that the Escobar Organization was conspiring to import approximately 1,500 kilograms of cocaine from Colombia for distribution in New York, and that Flores-Rivera had accompanied Cedres to look for appropriate \"drop zones\" on the island of Vieques.  From this evidence, the district court could have reasonably concluded that there was a sufficient nexus between Flores-Rivera's conspiracy conviction and the importation efforts of the other members of the conspiracy to attribute to him between 500 and 1500 kilograms of cocaine for sentencing purposes.  Accordingly, we find no error in the district court's determination of Flores-Rivera's BOL.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered the other issues raised by Flores-Rivera and find them to be similarly meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The rule authorizing motions for severance states in pertinent part:  \"If it appears that a defendant ... is prejudiced by a joinder ... of defendants ... for trial together, the court may ... grant a severance of defendants, or provide whatever other relief justice requires.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 14</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We also note that the jury acquitted Flores-Rivera on Counts 3, 4, and 34, which charged importation of cocaine, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and use of a communication facility to commit a drug crime.  This suggests that the jury was able to sift through the evidence in an analytical fashion and that the alleged spillover effect did not cause the jury merely to enter a lump conviction against Flores-Rivera.  See Brandon, 17 F.3d at 440 (finding acquittals to be a relevant factor in upholding a district court's denial of a severance) (collecting cases)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Federal law requires that all grand and petit jurors have the ability to speak English and read, write and understand English with proficiency sufficient to fill out satisfactorily the juror qualification form.  28 U.S.C.

Flores-Rivera fails to identify any statute or caselaw requiring that the district courts conduct voir dire entirely in English.  Moreover, he has not explained how he was prejudiced by the bilingual voir dire, especially in light of the fact that he requested that the district court perform its voir dire in Spanish.  Consequently, we deem this argument waived.  See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.)  (discussing \"the settled appellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived\") (collecting cases), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Flores-Rivera also maintains that the indictment is multiplicitous and violates the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution because the substantive crimes charged in Counts 3, 4 and 34 are \"in fact and in law\" identical to the overt acts alleged under the conspiracy Count.  This argument falls short for two reasons.  First, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not implicated here because Flores-Rivera was acquitted of the substantive crimes charged in the indictment, and therefore the sentencing court did not impose multiple punishments for the same offense.  See Jones v. Thomas, 491 U.S. 376, 381, 109 S.Ct. 2522, 2525-26, 105 L.Ed.2d 322 (1989) (noting that the Double Jeopardy Clause affords protection against multiple punishments for the same offense imposed in a single proceeding.);  Missouri v. Hunter, 459 U.S. 359, 366, 103 S.Ct. 673, 678, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983) (noting that \"the Double Jeopardy Clause does no more than prevent the sentencing court from prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended\")</p>\n        <p>Second, the fact that Flores-Rivera's indictment charges both conspiracy and the substantive crimes involved in the conspiracy fails to implicate the Double Jeopardy Clause because it has long been the rule that \"a substantive crime, and a conspiracy to commit that crime, are not the 'same offense' for double jeopardy purposes.\"  United States v. Felix, 503 U.S. 378, 389, 112 S.Ct. 1377, 1384, 118 L.Ed.2d 25 (1992) (citing United States v.

On April 14, 1993, a jury convicted Flores-Rivera on one count of conspiracy to import cocaine and to possess cocaine with intent to distribute it, in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 846 and 963 (Count 2), and two counts of assaulting a federal officer with a deadly weapon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 111, (Counts 5 and 6).  The jury acquitted Flores-Rivera on Counts 3, 4, and 34, which charged importation of cocaine, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and use of a communication facility to commit a drug crime, in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 952, 841(a)(1), and 843(b), respectively.  The district court sentenced Flores-Rivera to 324 months' imprisonment, to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release.  Flores-Rivera now appeals.  For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the government.  United States v.

The focus of this case was a large drug trafficking conspiracy.  The conspirators, headed by co-defendant Eusebio Escobar-de Jesus (\"Escobar\"), worked with members of the Medellin and Cali drug cartels to import cocaine from Colombia into Puerto Rico and New York.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The linchpin witness for the government's case against Flores-Rivera was William Cedres (\"Cedres\"), a confidential informant.  Cedres testified that he infiltrated the conspiracy and gained the confidence of Escobar.  In 1990, Cedres became the \"number two man\" in Escobar's organization.  Cedres testified that Escobar informed him that Flores-Rivera was a member of the organization.  Cedres also testified that Flores-Rivera had accompanied him to the island of Vieques to look for sites where an airplane could land or drop-off kilogram quantities of cocaine in the future.  Cedres indicated that the conspirators were planning to use the new sites to import approximately 1,500 kilograms of cocaine.  The Medellin cartel was to supply the cocaine, and the importation was to be divided into four or five shipments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cedres also testified that Escobar had instructed Flores-Rivera to supervise the importation of between 300 and 500 kilograms of cocaine from Colombia.  Flores-Rivera was tape recorded discussing the importation plans with Cedres and Escobar.  The tape recording, along with Cedres' testimony, indicate that Flores-Rivera was to travel to Colombia and return in a boat loaded with cocaine to one of Escobar's properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also presented evidence of Flores-Rivera's involvement in the April 1986 shooting of two U.S. Customs agents.  Two witnesses testified that on April 14, 1986, they saw Flores-Rivera arrive at the Isla Grande Flying School in a yellow, flatbed tanker-truck and purchase over 100 gallons of aviation fuel.  Two U.S. Customs agents followed Flores-Rivera as he drove the tanker-truck from the flying school to a farm housing a covert landing strip used by the Escobar organization.  From their surveillance post outside the farm, the Customs agents observed Flores-Rivera and codefendant Andres Morales-Cruz enter the farm.  Later that night, the Customs agents saw a small airplane land at the farm.  Shortly thereafter, the Customs agents witnessed an unidentified man clad in army fatigues exit the farm in a white van.  The Customs agents followed.  When the van got to a small curve in the road, it stopped as if to make a U-turn.  As the Customs agents tried to drive by, the van's occupants opened fire on them, severely injuring both agents.  The agents were never able to identify the attackers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Given that we resolve any credibility issues in favor of the verdict, we find that Flores-Rivera's sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge fails because the record contains ample support for his conspiracy conviction.  A reasonable jury could infer from Cedres' testimony that Flores-Rivera was deeply involved in the entire operation.  Cedres testified that Flores-Rivera was a member of the Escobar conspiracy, and that Flores-Rivera accompanied him to Vieques to search for appropriate landing sites for drug drop-offs.  Moreover, the evidence against Flores-Rivera includes a tape-recorded conversation in which Flores-Rivera discusses importation plans with Escobar and Cedres.  The tape recording also indicates that Flores-Rivera agreed to go to Colombia and return in a boat laden with cocaine.  In sum, the evidence demonstrates clearly and convincingly that Flores-Rivera was a knowing and voluntary participant in many aspects of the Escobar drug conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.

Under Pinkerton, the government was required to prove that the April 14, 1986, assault on the U.S. Customs agents was carried out by members of the Escobar conspiracy, in furtherance of the conspiracy, and at a time when Flores-Rivera was still a member of the conspiracy.  United States v.

The jury heard the following facts:  On April 14, 1986, Flores-Rivera brought airplane fuel to a farm housing a covert landing strip operated by the conspirators.  While the Customs agents were surveilling the farm, a plane landed at the farm and, shortly thereafter, a man clad in army fatigues exited in a white van.  The Customs agents followed the van.  The van stopped as if to make a U-turn, and as the Customs agents drove by, they were fired upon by the van's occupants.  In these circumstances, a reasonable jury could have found that the shooting was committed by members of the conspiracy, in furtherance of the conspiracy, and while Flores-Rivera was still a member of the conspiracy.  Therefore, we find that there was sufficient evidence to convict Flores-Rivera under Pinkerton liability for assault on a federal officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject both of his challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Separate Trials</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores-Rivera alleges that the district court erroneously denied his Rule 14 motion for severance.

This practice helps both to prevent inconsistent verdicts and to conserve resources (judicial and prosecutorial).  Thus, when multiple defendants are named in a single indictment, a defendant who seeks a separate trial can ordinarily succeed in obtaining one only by making a strong showing of evident prejudice.  The hurdle is intentionally high;  recent Supreme Court precedent instructs that \"a district court should grant a severance under Rule 14 only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

In support of this contention, he points out that he was named in less than ten percent of all the overt acts charged in the indictment and that his alleged role in the conspiracy was significantly less than that of his codefendants.

Specifically, Flores-Rivera claims that Agent Tejada misled the grand jury when he testified (1) that the government's informant, William Cedres, was a businessman, (2) that Cedres had been arrested only once, and (3) that Cedres had infiltrated the defendant's drug organization rather than being recruited by authorities from within the organization and then \"flipping\" pursuant to a formal cooperation agreement with the prosecution.  The district court addressed these issues before trial and found them meritless.  In particular, the district court found (1) that Cedres was indeed a businessman, (2) that at the time of Agent Tejada's testimony, there was only one arrest listed in Cedres' criminal history, and (3) that no evidence substantiated the allegation that Cedres had \"flipped\" pursuant to a formal cooperation agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Bank of Nova Scotia v.

A court should not inquire into the sufficiency of the evidence before the indicting grand jury, because the grand jury proceeding is merely a preliminary phase and all constitutional protections are afforded at trial.  Once a defendant has been convicted by a petit jury, the petit jury's verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt demonstrates a fortiori that there was probable cause to charge the defendants with the offenses for which they were convicted.

Here, Flores-Rivera was properly convicted by a petit jury after he and his codefendants were afforded ample opportunity to cross-examine Cedres at trial.  Moreover, Flores-Rivera has not demonstrated that the alleged misconduct in fact occurred, much less that it was prejudicial or outrageous.  Accordingly, we find that Flores-Rivera's proper conviction by a petit jury cures any alleged error before the grand jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. Evidentiary Matters</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores-Rivera maintains that his trial was marred by four evidentiary errors, and that each constitutes reversible error.  We address his contentions in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. \"Other crimes\" evidence:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores-Rivera's first contends that the prosecutor improperly elicited inadmissible evidence of \"other crimes\" from informant Cedres.  Cedres did allude to the fact that defendant Escobar had spent time in prison.  Counsel for Escobar immediately objected and demanded a mistrial.  Flores-Rivera joined in this motion.  The court denied the defendants' motions for mistrial, issued curative instructions, and admonished the government to keep its questions simple to avoid eliciting further improper testimony.  Flores-Rivera insists that the curative instructions were insufficient and that the court erred in not granting a mistrial.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, \"we will presume that juries can and will follow instructions to disregard inadmissible evidence inadvertently presented.\"  United States v.

Here, the risk of prejudice to Flores-Rivera was slim because Cedres alluded only to codefendant Escobar's prison time;  Cedres did not indicate that Flores-Rivera had also served prison time.  Moreover, the district court issued a timely and forceful curative instruction, to which neither Flores-Rivera nor Escobar objected.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Accordingly, we affirm the district court's refusal to grant a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Pre-conspiracy evidence:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores-Rivera also contends that the district court erred in admitting evidence that drugs were imported by codefendants Escobar and Santos-Caraballo in March of 1986, one month before the start of the conspiracy alleged in Count 2.  Flores-Rivera notes correctly that the evidence was admissible against his codefendants, but not against him.  He argues that the court's instruction to this effect was insufficient and confusing.  This contention has little merit and can be disposed of quickly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevent prejudice to the other defendants, the district court issued an extensive limiting instruction to the jury, which included the admonishment:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>[T]his evidence will only be considered by you in reference to defendants [Escobar] and [Santos-Caraballo].  This evidence only relates to them.  It doesn't relate at all whatsoever to Michael Cruz-Gonzalez, to Eric Flores-Rivera or to Andres Morales-Cruz.  They are not involved in that.  So if you consider this evidence, it pertains only to those two defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This instruction clearly instructed the jury that it was not to consider the pre-conspiracy evidence against Flores-Rivera.  Accordingly, we reject Flores-Rivera's contention that the admission of this evidence constituted reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Statements of co-conspirators:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores-Rivera also contends that the district court misapplied the co-conspirator exclusion to the hearsay rule and thus clearly erred when it admitted the out-of-court statements of codefendant Escobar.  Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E) excludes from the operation of the hearsay rule \"a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).  \"To invoke the exception, a party who wants to introduce a particular statement must show by a preponderance of the evidence that a conspiracy embracing both the declarant and the defendant existed, and that the declarant uttered the statement during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"  United States v.

Flores-Rivera contends that this statement was improperly admitted under the co-conspirator exclusion because it was not made in furtherance of the conspiracy.  We disagree.  As we have often explained, a damaging statement is admissible under 801(d)(2)(E) if it \"tends to advance the objects of the conspiracy as opposed to thwarting its purpose.\"  United States v.

The evidence shows that Escobar intended to make Cedres \"the number two man in his organization.\"   Clearly, such a person would need to know the identities of the players in the organization, and statements to this end are certainly in furtherance of the conspiracy.

The district court judge rejected this same averment at trial, stating that the photo spreads were among the fairest he had seen.  Moreover, even if the photo spreads had been impermissibly suggestive, the circumstances indicate that the subsequent in-court identifications were reliable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two witnesses testified that they had seen Flores-Rivera purchase aviation fuel at the Isla Grande Flying School on April 14, 1986, the day that the Customs agents were shot.  Awilda Torres de Reyes, the owner of the flying school, testified that Flores-Rivera had arrived in a flatbed tanker-truck and purchased over 100 gallons of aviation fuel, an unusually large amount.  She stated that it required between one and two hours to complete the transaction, thus giving her ample time to view the defendant.  She testified further that the transaction stuck in her mind because the defendant had purchased an unusually large amount of fuel, and that she suspected that the purchase was connected to a drug trafficking scheme because she knew that drug traffickers often required large quantities of aviation fuel.  She indicated that the transaction became especially memorable the following day when she read that two U.S. Customs agents had been shot while investigating a narcotics operation.  She called the Customs office and informed them that she had sold a suspiciously large quantity of aviation fuel on the same day as the shooting, and that she thought that the two incidents might be connected.  The second witness who identified Flores-Rivera as the April 14 fuel-purchaser was Raul Jimenez, who was then working as a pilot for the Puerto Rico Department of Justice.  He testified that the incident was memorable to him because he was forced to wait for over an hour while Flores-Rivera was filling the tanks on the flatbed truck.  Mr. Jimenez also indicated that he contacted Customs agents after he heard rumors that a flatbed tanker truck had been involved in the shooting of two Customs agents on the night of the fuel purchase.

In the case of jointly undertaken criminal activity--whether or not charged as a conspiracy--relevant conduct includes all acts reasonably foreseeable by the defendant and committed in furtherance of the jointly undertaken activity.

Cedres testified that Escobar ordered Flores-Rivera to supervise the importation of between 300 and 500 kilograms of cocaine from Colombia.  The district court could reasonably have attributed this quantity to Flores-Rivera for sentencing purposes, and Flores-Rivera concedes as much.  Cedres also testified that the Escobar Organization was conspiring to import approximately 1,500 kilograms of cocaine from Colombia for distribution in New York, and that Flores-Rivera had accompanied Cedres to look for appropriate \"drop zones\" on the island of Vieques.  From this evidence, the district court could have reasonably concluded that there was a sufficient nexus between Flores-Rivera's conspiracy conviction and the importation efforts of the other members of the conspiracy to attribute to him between 500 and 1500 kilograms of cocaine for sentencing purposes.  Accordingly, we find no error in the district court's determination of Flores-Rivera's BOL.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered the other issues raised by Flores-Rivera and find them to be similarly meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The rule authorizing motions for severance states in pertinent part:  \"If it appears that a defendant ... is prejudiced by a joinder ... of defendants ... for trial together, the court may ... grant a severance of defendants, or provide whatever other relief justice requires.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 14</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We also note that the jury acquitted Flores-Rivera on Counts 3, 4, and 34, which charged importation of cocaine, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and use of a communication facility to commit a drug crime.  This suggests that the jury was able to sift through the evidence in an analytical fashion and that the alleged spillover effect did not cause the jury merely to enter a lump conviction against Flores-Rivera.

Flores-Rivera fails to identify any statute or caselaw requiring that the district courts conduct voir dire entirely in English.  Moreover, he has not explained how he was prejudiced by the bilingual voir dire, especially in light of the fact that he requested that the district court perform its voir dire in Spanish.  Consequently, we deem this argument waived.  See United States v.

This argument falls short for two reasons.  First, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not implicated here because Flores-Rivera was acquitted of the substantive crimes charged in the indictment, and therefore the sentencing court did not impose multiple punishments for the same offense.
