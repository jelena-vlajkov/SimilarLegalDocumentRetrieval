Udo challenges  his  layoff from  Taunton State  Hospital\n\n(\"Taunton\"),   which  is   operated   by  the   Massachusetts\n\nDepartment  of Mental  Health (\"DMH\").   Udo claims  that DMH\n\nlaid him  off because of  age discrimination in  violation of\n\nthe Age Discrimination in  Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C.\n\n   626(b), and race discrimination  in violation of Title VII\n\nof the  Civil Rights Act of  1964, 42 U.S.C.    2000(e).  Udo\n\nalso   claims  that   defendant-appellee  Henry   Tomes,  the\n\nCommissioner of DMH, in  his individual capacity deprived him\n\nof his  civil rights in violation  of 42 U.S.C.    1983.  The\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment to defendant, and Udo\n\nappeals.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \n\n                          Background\r                                      Background\r                                                \n\n          In   October   1990,   the    Massachusetts   state\n\nlegislature directed  all state agencies,  including DMH,  to\n\nimplement cost-saving measures to address underfunding in the\n\nFiscal  Year  1991  budget.   DMH  responded  to this  fiscal\n\nemergency  with  a  plan   that  included  significant  staff\n\nreductions.   In connection with its  state-wide reduction in\n\nforce,  DMH  eliminated the  two  Physician  II positions  at\n\nTaunton, one of which Udo held.  At that time, DMH employed a\n\ntotal of nineteen Physician IIs in its various hospitals.  Of\n\nthose, Udo had the most seniority, having been employed since\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n1975.   Udo was also  the only Black and,  at sixty-five, the\n\noldest of the nineteen Physician IIs employed by DMH.\n\n          Tomes  notified Udo  by  letter dated  October  12,\n\n1990, that his position  at Taunton had been eliminated.   In\n\nthe letter, in accordance  with procedures under which senior\n\nemployees  whose positions  are  eliminated  can \"bump\"  less\n\nsenior employees, Tomes offered  Udo certain bumping options.\n\nTomes  also  notified  Udo  that  he  could request  an  exit\n\ninterview  with the  DMH Equal  Employment/Affirmative Action\n\nOffice to determine if any affirmative action rights had been\n\nabridged.    Although Udo  requested  such  an interview,  no\n\ninterview was ever conducted.   Udo elected to bump  into the\n\nPhysician II position at Metropolitan State Hospital, and, on\n\nOctober  26, 1990, Tomes sent Udo a letter indicating that he\n\nhad been awarded that position.\n\n          After awarding  Udo  the Physician  II position  at\n\nMetropolitan  State Hospital,  DMH  became aware  that, as  a\n\nresult  of  a   disciplinary  action  for   malpractice,  the\n\nMassachusetts  Board of  Registration  in  Medicine  had,  on\n\nOctober  17,  1990,  restricted  Udo's  license  to  practice\n\nmedicine  to  Taunton.    Consequently,  in  a  letter  dated\n\nNovember 6, 1990, Tomes informed Udo, \"Since your election to\n\npractice medicine at Metropolitan State Hospital  is contrary\n\nto  this   disciplinary  action,  you   are  hereby  laid-off\n\neffective November 17, 1990.\"\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          Udo,   a   member  of   the   Massachusetts  Nurses\n\nAssociation  (\"MNA\"),  challenged  the  elimination   of  his\n\nposition and his layoff through the grievance process set out\n\nin  the union's collective bargaining agreement, arguing that\n\nthose  actions violated  the collective  bargaining agreement\n\nand  that they were discriminatory  in terms of  both age and\n\nrace.1    The arbitrator  found  that  Udo's layoff  violated\n\nseniority  provisions of the  collective bargaining agreement\n\nand held that the  \"decision to lay off [Udo]  was arbitrary,\n\ncapricious  and   unreasonable  and  in   violation  of   the\n\ncontract.\"2     The  arbitrator   did   not  consider   Udo's\n\ndiscrimination claims.\n\n          In  April 1992,  before  his  arbitration case  was\n\nconcluded,  Udo became  aware that  Taunton had  advertised a\n\nPhysician  II position with a posting date of April 16, 1992,\n\nand a closing date  of April 24, 1992.   On May 8, 1992,  the\n\nMNA  notified Taunton that Udo was eligible to be recalled to\n\nthat position through the collective bargaining agreement, as\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  The  MNA also  pursued an  action with  the Massachusetts\nLabor  Relations Commission against DMH on  behalf of all MNA\nmembers who  had  been laid  off  or bumped  (including  Udo)\nduring   the  state-wide   reduction   in   force,  and   the\nMassachusetts Labor  Relations Commission found  that DMH had\nviolated the collective bargaining agreement.\n\n2.  The  arbitrator  rendered his  decision  on  December 20,\n1992, giving  the parties ninety  days to reach  a settlement\nregarding relief.  Because the parties  were unable to agree,\non  June  11,  1993,  the  arbitrator  ordered  that  Udo  be\nreinstated to  his position  at Taunton and  that he  receive\npartial back pay.\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nthe  agreement provides  for recall  following layoff  at any\n\ntime within two years.   DMH responded that it  had rescinded\n\nthat  announcement  and  that  the  position  was  no  longer\n\navailable.   Udo later found  out that the  position had been\n\nfilled by an  \"03\" physician.  An  03 physician has  the same\n\nduties  as a  Physician  II, but  does  not come  within  the\n\ncollective bargaining agreement.\n\n          In addition to  challenging the elimination of  his\n\nposition and  his layoff  through his  union,  Udo filed  the\n\ninstant  action.    The  district  court  granted defendant's\n\nmotion for summary judgment, and Udo appeals.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \n\nA.

In\r                                               \n\nreduction-in-force cases, the plaintiff establishes the prima\n\nfacie case by demonstrating that  he or she (1) was a  member\n\nof a protected class, (2)  met the employer's legitimate job-\n\nperformance expectations, (3) was laid off, and (4) that  the\n\nemployer either did not treat  members of the protected class\n\nneutrally or retained persons  not within the protected class\n\nin the same position.

As\r                   \n\nits  reason for laying Udo off, DMH points to the restriction\n\non Udo's medical license  that made it impossible for  him to\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nbump  to  another hospital.3    This  reason satisfies  DMH's\n\nburden of production  and shifts  the burden back  to Udo  to\n\nprove  that   DMH's  proffered   reason  is  a   pretext  for\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n          Even assuming arguendo that DMH's immediate seizure\r                                            \n\non  the restriction on Udo's  license was a  pretext for some\n\nother  reason,4  in order  to  survive a  motion  for summary\n\njudgment,  Udo's evidence must also allow a jury to find that\n\nDMH's  articulated reason was  a pretext  for discrimination.\r                                                                        \n\nSee Smith, 40 F.3d at 16 (\"Title VII does not grant relief to\r                     \n\na plaintiff  who has  been discharged unfairly,  even by  the\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  The  exact language  of the  restriction placed  on Udo's\nlicense is as follows:\n          The  Respondent  [Udo] will  restrict his\n          current practice of  medicine to  Taunton\n          State Hospital and its affiliate programs\n          where he currently practices, or to those\r                                                               \n          hospitals  and  their affiliates  who are\r                                                               \n          approved by  the  Board in  advance,  and\r                                                         \n          such  practice will  be  monitored  by  a\n          Board-approved  monitoring physician  who\n          will report  to the  Board, on  a regular\n          basis,  the   Respondent's  activity  and\n          quality of patient care rendered by him.\n(emphasis added).\n          Although  the Board  imposed  this  restriction  on\nUdo's medical  license on October  17, 1990, it  stemmed from\nmalpractice occurring before 1980 at St. Luke's Hospital.  At\nUdo's request, on  November 28, 1990,  the Board changed  the\nrestriction to allow  Udo to practice at  other hospitals and\nclinics under the jurisdiction of DMH.\n\n4.  We note  that the  arbitrator found  Udo's  layoff to  be\n\"arbitrary, capricious  or unreasonable  and in violation  of\nthe  contract.\"  While  we, of course,  are not  bound by the\narbitrator's findings,  Alexander v. Gardner-Denver  Co., 415\r                                                                    \nU.S.  36, 59-60  (1974), the  arbitrator's decision  could be\nconsidered some evidence of pretext.\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nmost   irrational   of  managers,   unless   the   facts  and\n\ncircumstances indicate  that  discriminatory animus  was  the\n\nreason for the decision.\").\n\n          To  establish  that  he  was  the  victim  of  race\n\ndiscrimination, Udo presents an  MNA document that shows that\n\nthe nineteen Physician IIs employed by DMH at the time he was\n\nlaid  off  comprised  eleven   Caucasians,  six  Asians,  one\n\nHispanic, and one Black  (Udo).  Based on this  document, Udo\n\nmaintains that  DMH retained all eleven  Caucasians, but that\n\nit  laid off the only Black (Udo), the only Hispanic, and two\n\nof the six  Asians.  DMH responds with the  affidavit of Jeff\n\nMcCue,  DMH's  Assistant  Commissioner for  Human  Resources.\n\nAccording  to McCue,  DMH  eliminated only  two Physician  II\n\npositions,  not four,  namely the  two positions  at Taunton.\n\nMcCue explains  that because neither  Udo nor Dr.  Pandya, an\n\nAsian  who  held the  other  Taunton  Physician II  position,\n\nexercised  their bumping  options, neither  of the  two least\n\nsenior  Physician IIs, who happened  to be a  Hispanic and an\n\nAsian, were laid off.\n\n          Udo also  argues that DMH's failure  to conduct his\n\nrequested  exit interview  to  determine whether  affirmative\n\naction rights pertaining to him were being abridged evidences\n\nDMH's  discriminatory  animus.    DMH  states  that  no  exit\n\ninterview  was   conducted  because  Udo   asked  Richard  C.\n\nHaddocks, Jr.,  the Director  of Human Resources  at Taunton,\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nfor  an exit interview on October 18, 1990, but Haddocks took\n\na medical  leave of  absence beginning on  October 21,  1990,\n\nprior to taking action  on Udo's request, and did  not return\n\nto work until after Udo had been laid off.5\n\n          As evidence of age  discrimination, Udo notes  that\n\nin  June 1990,  Haddocks sent  him a  letter stating  that he\n\nwould  have to retire since  he turned sixty-five that month.\n\nAfter  Udo  informed  him  that  he  was  mistaken  and  that\n\nretirement  was  not  required  until  age seventy,  Haddocks\n\nchecked  further into the matter and informed Udo that he was\n\ncorrect.  In his affidavit submitted with defendant's summary\n\njudgment motion, Haddocks stated that he wrote the retirement\n\nletter because he had received incorrect information from the\n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.  Udo also notes  that \"the affirmative action plan  of DMH\nspecifically  provides that any layoff  action by DMH must be\nreviewed by the EEO Administrator  before it becomes final to\ndetermine  if  such  action  represents a  breakdown  in  the\naffirmative action  program and therefore  calls for remedial\naction.\"  DMH responds  that \"[t]he EEO Administrator did  in\nfact  review  the plan  for  staff  reductions prior  to  its\nimplementation.\"  Thus, DMH  claims that while Udo  failed to\nreceive his  exit interview, the EEO  Administrator had still\nreviewed his layoff.  \n          Udo points out,  however, that the most DMH did was\ninitially  review  the  reduction  in  force  \"prior  to  its\nimplementation,\" but that this  included only the elimination\nof Udo's Taunton  position and  not his actual  layoff.   Udo\nseems  to cite this as evidence that \"the layoff should never\n[have]  become final,\" rather than as evidence of age or race\ndiscrimination.   While  this evidence  may constitute  proof\nthat DMH violated the  collective bargaining agreement, we do\nnot think that it tends to prove that Udo was laid off as the\nresult of age or race discrimination.\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nMassachusetts State Board of  Retirement that Udo was subject\n\nto mandatory retirement at age sixty-five.\n\n          As evidence  of both age  and race  discrimination,\n\nUdo  also points  to DMH's  behavior after  he applied  for a\n\nPhysician II position  at Taunton that was  advertised by DMH\n\nin April 1992.  DMH allegedly responded to  Udo's application\n\nby  stating  that  the  announcement and  position  had  been\n\nrescinded, but then later hired an \"03\" contract physician to\n\nfill the position.\n\n          We  do  not  think  that, given  this  evidence,  a\n\nrational  jury would be  able to find  that DMH discriminated\n\nagainst  Udo because  of  his age  or  his  race.   That  DMH\n\neliminated two positions, which were occupied by a Black  and\n\nan  Asian, does not show that DMH was improperly motivated by\n\nage or race when it subsequently laid Udo off.   See Lawrence\r                                                                         \n\nv. Northrop Corp., 980 F.2d 66, 74 n.13 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"Nor\r                             \n\ncan the fact that the three oldest associate program managers\n\nin  Organization  4000 were  targeted  for  layoff itself  be\n\nviewed   as   giving   rise    to   an   inference   of   age\n\ndiscrimination.\").  Similarly, we have  trouble understanding\n\nhow  DMH's failure  to  conduct an  exit  interview prior  to\n\nlaying Udo  off shows that  the decision  to lay him  off was\n\ndiscriminatory  in  motive.    Nor   do  we  think  that  the\n\nretirement  letter Udo received shows age  animus on the part\n\nof  DMH;   rather,  it   seems  merely   to  show  that   the\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nMassachusetts State Board  of Retirement  sent DMH  incorrect\n\ninformation.

Ct. 2965 (1992).\r                                       \n\n          We focus in particular on the fact that Udo was not\n\nrecalled to his  position at  Taunton.  While  this tends  to\n\nindicate  that DMH  did  not want  to  rehire him,  and  thus\n\nsupports the  inference that  the restriction on  his license\n\nmay  have been  a pretext,  it does not  by itself  provide a\n\nbasis for inferring age or race discrimination.  That DMH may\n\nhave violated the collective  bargaining agreement yet  again\n\nwhen it  failed to recall Udo  does not indicate  that DMH is\n\nthereby also liable under Title VII or the ADEA.\n\n          Because Udo has  not presented evidence that  would\n\nenable a rational jury to find  that he was laid off  because\n\nof  age or race discrimination, we hold that DMH was entitled\n\nto  summary judgment  on  Udo's age  and race  discrimination\n\nclaims.\n\nC.  Section 1983\r                            \n\n          Udo  also sued  Tomes in  his individual  capacity,\n\nclaiming that  Tomes violated  his civil rights  by depriving\n\nhim of  employment through  an unlawful  layoff based  on his\n\nrace, in violation of 42 U.S.C.    1983.  Because, as we held\n\nabove, Udo failed to raise a  triable issue as to whether his\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nlayoff was motivated  by discriminatory intent, the  district\n\ncourt properly granted Tomes summary judgment on this claim.\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \n\n          We hold that  Udo failed to create  a genuine issue\n\nof triable fact  on his age  and race discrimination  claims,\n\nand  therefore  also  on  his    1983  claim.    Accordingly,\n\ndefendant was entitled to summary judgment.

Udo challenges  his  layoff from  Taunton State  Hospital\n\n(\"Taunton\"),   which  is   operated   by  the   Massachusetts\n\nDepartment  of Mental  Health (\"DMH\").   Udo claims  that DMH\n\nlaid him  off because of  age discrimination in  violation of\n\nthe Age Discrimination in  Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C.\n\n   626(b), and race discrimination  in violation of Title VII\n\nof the  Civil Rights Act of  1964, 42 U.S.C.    2000(e).  Udo\n\nalso   claims  that   defendant-appellee  Henry   Tomes,  the\n\nCommissioner of DMH, in  his individual capacity deprived him\n\nof his  civil rights in violation  of 42 U.S.C.    1983.  The\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment to defendant, and Udo\n\nappeals.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \n\n                          Background\r                                      Background\r                                                \n\n          In   October   1990,   the    Massachusetts   state\n\nlegislature directed  all state agencies,  including DMH,  to\n\nimplement cost-saving measures to address underfunding in the\n\nFiscal  Year  1991  budget.   DMH  responded  to this  fiscal\n\nemergency  with  a  plan   that  included  significant  staff\n\nreductions.   In connection with its  state-wide reduction in\n\nforce,  DMH  eliminated the  two  Physician  II positions  at\n\nTaunton, one of which Udo held.  At that time, DMH employed a\n\ntotal of nineteen Physician IIs in its various hospitals.  Of\n\nthose, Udo had the most seniority, having been employed since\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n1975.   Udo was also  the only Black and,  at sixty-five, the\n\noldest of the nineteen Physician IIs employed by DMH.\n\n          Tomes  notified Udo  by  letter dated  October  12,\n\n1990, that his position  at Taunton had been eliminated.   In\n\nthe letter, in accordance  with procedures under which senior\n\nemployees  whose positions  are  eliminated  can \"bump\"  less\n\nsenior employees, Tomes offered  Udo certain bumping options.\n\nTomes  also  notified  Udo  that  he  could request  an  exit\n\ninterview  with the  DMH Equal  Employment/Affirmative Action\n\nOffice to determine if any affirmative action rights had been\n\nabridged.    Although Udo  requested  such  an interview,  no\n\ninterview was ever conducted.   Udo elected to bump  into the\n\nPhysician II position at Metropolitan State Hospital, and, on\n\nOctober  26, 1990, Tomes sent Udo a letter indicating that he\n\nhad been awarded that position.\n\n          After awarding  Udo  the Physician  II position  at\n\nMetropolitan  State Hospital,  DMH  became aware  that, as  a\n\nresult  of  a   disciplinary  action  for   malpractice,  the\n\nMassachusetts  Board of  Registration  in  Medicine  had,  on\n\nOctober  17,  1990,  restricted  Udo's  license  to  practice\n\nmedicine  to  Taunton.    Consequently,  in  a  letter  dated\n\nNovember 6, 1990, Tomes informed Udo, \"Since your election to\n\npractice medicine at Metropolitan State Hospital  is contrary\n\nto  this   disciplinary  action,  you   are  hereby  laid-off\n\neffective November 17, 1990.\"\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          Udo,   a   member  of   the   Massachusetts  Nurses\n\nAssociation  (\"MNA\"),  challenged  the  elimination   of  his\n\nposition and his layoff through the grievance process set out\n\nin  the union's collective bargaining agreement, arguing that\n\nthose  actions violated  the collective  bargaining agreement\n\nand  that they were discriminatory  in terms of  both age and\n\nrace.1    The arbitrator  found  that  Udo's layoff  violated\n\nseniority  provisions of the  collective bargaining agreement\n\nand held that the  \"decision to lay off [Udo]  was arbitrary,\n\ncapricious  and   unreasonable  and  in   violation  of   the\n\ncontract.\"2     The  arbitrator   did   not  consider   Udo's\n\ndiscrimination claims.\n\n          In  April 1992,  before  his  arbitration case  was\n\nconcluded,  Udo became  aware that  Taunton had  advertised a\n\nPhysician  II position with a posting date of April 16, 1992,\n\nand a closing date  of April 24, 1992.   On May 8, 1992,  the\n\nMNA  notified Taunton that Udo was eligible to be recalled to\n\nthat position through the collective bargaining agreement, as\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  The  MNA also  pursued an  action with  the Massachusetts\nLabor  Relations Commission against DMH on  behalf of all MNA\nmembers who  had  been laid  off  or bumped  (including  Udo)\nduring   the  state-wide   reduction   in   force,  and   the\nMassachusetts Labor  Relations Commission found  that DMH had\nviolated the collective bargaining agreement.\n\n2.  The  arbitrator  rendered his  decision  on  December 20,\n1992, giving  the parties ninety  days to reach  a settlement\nregarding relief.  Because the parties  were unable to agree,\non  June  11,  1993,  the  arbitrator  ordered  that  Udo  be\nreinstated to  his position  at Taunton and  that he  receive\npartial back pay.\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nthe  agreement provides  for recall  following layoff  at any\n\ntime within two years.   DMH responded that it  had rescinded\n\nthat  announcement  and  that  the  position  was  no  longer\n\navailable.   Udo later found  out that the  position had been\n\nfilled by an  \"03\" physician.  An  03 physician has  the same\n\nduties  as a  Physician  II, but  does  not come  within  the\n\ncollective bargaining agreement.\n\n          In addition to  challenging the elimination of  his\n\nposition and  his layoff  through his  union,  Udo filed  the\n\ninstant  action.    The  district  court  granted defendant's\n\nmotion for summary judgment, and Udo appeals.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \n\nA.

Based on this  document, Udo\n\nmaintains that  DMH retained all eleven  Caucasians, but that\n\nit  laid off the only Black (Udo), the only Hispanic, and two\n\nof the six  Asians.  DMH responds with the  affidavit of Jeff\n\nMcCue,  DMH's  Assistant  Commissioner for  Human  Resources.\n\nAccording  to McCue,  DMH  eliminated only  two Physician  II\n\npositions,  not four,  namely the  two positions  at Taunton.\n\nMcCue explains  that because neither  Udo nor Dr.  Pandya, an\n\nAsian  who  held the  other  Taunton  Physician II  position,\n\nexercised  their bumping  options, neither  of the  two least\n\nsenior  Physician IIs, who happened  to be a  Hispanic and an\n\nAsian, were laid off.\n\n          Udo also  argues that DMH's failure  to conduct his\n\nrequested  exit interview  to  determine whether  affirmative\n\naction rights pertaining to him were being abridged evidences\n\nDMH's  discriminatory  animus.    DMH  states  that  no  exit\n\ninterview  was   conducted  because  Udo   asked  Richard  C.\n\nHaddocks, Jr.,  the Director  of Human Resources  at Taunton,\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nfor  an exit interview on October 18, 1990, but Haddocks took\n\na medical  leave of  absence beginning on  October 21,  1990,\n\nprior to taking action  on Udo's request, and did  not return\n\nto work until after Udo had been laid off.5\n\n          As evidence of age  discrimination, Udo notes  that\n\nin  June 1990,  Haddocks sent  him a  letter stating  that he\n\nwould  have to retire since  he turned sixty-five that month.\n\nAfter  Udo  informed  him  that  he  was  mistaken  and  that\n\nretirement  was  not  required  until  age seventy,  Haddocks\n\nchecked  further into the matter and informed Udo that he was\n\ncorrect.  In his affidavit submitted with defendant's summary\n\njudgment motion, Haddocks stated that he wrote the retirement\n\nletter because he had received incorrect information from the\n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.  Udo also notes  that \"the affirmative action plan  of DMH\nspecifically  provides that any layoff  action by DMH must be\nreviewed by the EEO Administrator  before it becomes final to\ndetermine  if  such  action  represents a  breakdown  in  the\naffirmative action  program and therefore  calls for remedial\naction.\"  DMH responds  that \"[t]he EEO Administrator did  in\nfact  review  the plan  for  staff  reductions prior  to  its\nimplementation.\"  Thus, DMH  claims that while Udo  failed to\nreceive his  exit interview, the EEO  Administrator had still\nreviewed his layoff.  \n          Udo points out,  however, that the most DMH did was\ninitially  review  the  reduction  in  force  \"prior  to  its\nimplementation,\" but that this  included only the elimination\nof Udo's Taunton  position and  not his actual  layoff.   Udo\nseems  to cite this as evidence that \"the layoff should never\n[have]  become final,\" rather than as evidence of age or race\ndiscrimination.   While  this evidence  may constitute  proof\nthat DMH violated the  collective bargaining agreement, we do\nnot think that it tends to prove that Udo was laid off as the\nresult of age or race discrimination.\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nMassachusetts State Board of  Retirement that Udo was subject\n\nto mandatory retirement at age sixty-five.\n\n          As evidence  of both age  and race  discrimination,\n\nUdo  also points  to DMH's  behavior after  he applied  for a\n\nPhysician II position  at Taunton that was  advertised by DMH\n\nin April 1992.  DMH allegedly responded to  Udo's application\n\nby  stating  that  the  announcement and  position  had  been\n\nrescinded, but then later hired an \"03\" contract physician to\n\nfill the position.\n\n          We  do  not  think  that, given  this  evidence,  a\n\nrational  jury would be  able to find  that DMH discriminated\n\nagainst  Udo because  of  his age  or  his  race.   That  DMH\n\neliminated two positions, which were occupied by a Black  and\n\nan  Asian, does not show that DMH was improperly motivated by\n\nage or race when it subsequently laid Udo off.

While  this tends  to\n\nindicate  that DMH  did  not want  to  rehire him,  and  thus\n\nsupports the  inference that  the restriction on  his license\n\nmay  have been  a pretext,  it does not  by itself  provide a\n\nbasis for inferring age or race discrimination.  That DMH may\n\nhave violated the collective  bargaining agreement yet  again\n\nwhen it  failed to recall Udo  does not indicate  that DMH is\n\nthereby also liable under Title VII or the ADEA.\n\n          Because Udo has  not presented evidence that  would\n\nenable a rational jury to find  that he was laid off  because\n\nof  age or race discrimination, we hold that DMH was entitled\n\nto  summary judgment  on  Udo's age  and race  discrimination\n\nclaims.\n\nC.

Because, as we held\n\nabove, Udo failed to raise a  triable issue as to whether his\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nlayoff was motivated  by discriminatory intent, the  district\n\ncourt properly granted Tomes summary judgment on this claim.\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \n\n          We hold that  Udo failed to create  a genuine issue\n\nof triable fact  on his age  and race discrimination  claims,\n\nand  therefore  also  on  his    1983  claim.
