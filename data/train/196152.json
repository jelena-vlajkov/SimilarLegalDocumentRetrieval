This is an appeal\r                                                    \r\n\nfrom  a final  judgment of  the district  court in  an action\r\n\nbrought  by  a  number  of  foreign  reinsurance  syndicates,\r\n\ncompanies  and pools  against a domestic  reinsurance company\r\n\nand related parties.  At  issue are reinsurance contracts (or\r\n\n\"treaties,\"  as  they  are  known)  under  which  plaintiffs,\r\n\nCompagnie De Reassurance  D'Ile de France, et al.,1 agreed to\r\n\nreinsure portions  of risks selected, and  also reinsured, by\r\n\ndefendant New  England  Reinsurance Corp.  (\"NERCO\").   After\r\n\nsustaining heavy losses under these Treaties, plaintiffs sued\r\n\ndefendants  NERCO,  First  State  Insurance  Company  (\"First\r\n\nState\"), and Cameron and Colby Co., Inc. (\"Cameron &amp; Colby\"),\r\n\nalleging  that  they  had  been  induced  to  enter  into the\r\n\nreinsurance treaties by fraud, and further claiming breach of\r\n\ncontract,  violations  of Mass.  Gen. L.  ch.  93A,    2, and\r\n\nviolations   of  the   Racketeer   Influenced   and   Corrupt\r\n\nOrganizations  Act   (\"RICO\"),   18  U.S.C.        1961-1968.\r\n\nDefendants  counterclaimed, alleging  breach of  contract and\r\n\nviolations of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93A,   2.  Following a 30-day\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  plaintiffs  are  listed  in  the   district  court's\r\nopinion.  See Compagnie de Reassurance D'Ile de France v. New\r                                                                         \r\nEngland  Reinsurance Corp.,  825 F.  Supp. 370,  373 n.2  (D.\r                                      \r\nMass. 1993).   Plaintiffs Pohjola Insurance  Company Ltd. and\r\nPohjola  Insurance  Company (UK)  Limited  were dismissed  on\r\nmotion of  the defendants, with the consent of the plaintiffs\r\nduring the  trial, and the  parties entered a  Stipulation of\r\nDismissal dated  May 5,  1995, whereby plaintiff  De Centrale\r\nHerzverzekering N.V. dismissed its appeal in No. 93-2338, and\r\nthe defendants dismissed their  appeal in No. 93-2339 against\r\nDe Centrale only, leaving 31 plaintiffs remaining.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nbench trial, the district  court found for the  plaintiffs on\r\n\nall but the RICO claims.  The court ordered rescission of the\r\n\nchallenged reinsurance Treaties and ordered defendants to pay\r\n\nplaintiffs $38,118,940.07, representing  all sums  plaintiffs\r\n\nhad previously paid out on losses incurred under the Treaties\r\n\nwith credit for premiums  received, plus prejudgment interest\r\n\nat 12 percent.  Defendants estimate that the net cost to them\r\n\nof the court's decision, adding together the court's judgment\r\n\nand  the sums plaintiffs have been excused from paying out as\r\n\nreinsurers of various losses, is approximately $106 million.\r\n\n          Defendants have  appealed  from the  judgments  for\r\n\nplaintiffs on the fraud,  contract and Mass. Gen. L.  ch. 93A\r\n\nclaims.   Plaintiffs  have cross-appealed  from the  district\r\n\ncourt's dismissal of their  RICO claim.  For the  reasons set\r\n\nforth  below, we  sustain the  district court's  findings and\r\n\nrulings on  certain matters; reverse others  as being clearly\r\n\nerroneous  or legally  incorrect;  and identify  still others\r\n\nthat require  the district court to make findings and rulings\r\n\nnow  absent.   We,  therefore,  vacate  the district  court's\r\n\njudgments  and  remand  for  further  proceedings  consistent\r\n\nherewith.  Our specific  dispositions are summarized on pages\r\n\n98-100 of this opinion.\r\n\nI.        Background\r                      Background\r\n\n          The following is an  overview.  More specific facts\r\n\nwill  be related as needed  in our discussion  of the various\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nissues.\r\n\n          The defendants are all subsidiaries of the Hartford\r\n\nGroup  of  Insurance  Companies  (\"the  Hartford\").2    First\r\n\nState, based in Boston, Massachusetts, was a primary insurer.\r\n\nNERCO was  a Boston-based reinsurer.   Cameron &amp;  Colby, also\r\n\nbased    in    Boston,   provided    management,   marketing,\r\n\nunderwriting,  and other  services  to both  First State  and\r\n\nNERCO.   Neither First State  nor NERCO had  employees of its\r\n\nown; their businesses were carried on by employees of Cameron\r\n\n&amp; Colby.  Graham  Watson, Inc.,3 not a party,  was created in\r\n\n1979 as  an unincorporated  division of Cameron  &amp; Colby;  it\r\n\nbecame  the  latter's  wholly owned  subsidiary  in mid-1980.\r\n\nGraham   Watson's  role   was   to   provide  marketing   and\r\n\nunderwriting   services   in  the   facultative4  reinsurance\r\n\nventure that is the subject of this litigation.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The  relationship  between  these  defendants  and  their\r\ncorporate parents, the Hartford and  ITT, is described in the\r\ndistrict court's opinion, 825  F. Supp. at 373.   Neither the\r\nHartford nor ITT is a party to this case.\r\n\n3.  This entity is  variously referred to  as \"Graham-Watson\"\r\nand \"Graham Watson\" in the documents contained in the record.\r\nLike  the district court, we will  use the unhyphenated form,\r\nunless quoting directly a source using the hyphenated form. \r\n\n4.  Facultative reinsurance is one of  the two major types of\r\nreinsurance, the  other being  treaty reinsurance.   From the\r\nLatin word for  \"ability\" or \"power,\"  \"facultative,\" broadly\r\nspeaking,  connotes  the option  to  reinsure,  or not,  each\r\nparticular risk, as contrasted  with a binding arrangement to\r\nreinsure all risks of a particular sort.  See infra.  A major\r                                                               \r\nissue in  this case is  whether the  reinsurance provided  by\r\ndefendants  was  \"facultative,\"  as  promised  in  the   SANS\r\nTreaties.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n          The  underlying casualty and property risks germane\r\n\nto  this case were located in North America.  Individuals and\r\n\nentities  wishing  to  insure  against  these  risks procured\r\n\npolicies of insurance from primary insurers.  The latter then\r\n\npurchased  reinsurance  from  NERCO  in  order  to  indemnify\r\n\nthemselves in whole or in part against losses sustained under\r\n\nthe primary policies they had issued.\r\n\n          Not  wanting to keep  all the exposure  that it had\r\n\nassumed as a reinsurer, NERCO itself    often acting with and\r\n\nthrough  Graham Watson     sought  reinsurance on  the London\r\n\ninsurance  market, resulting  in the arrangements  with which\r\n\nthis lawsuit is concerned.  Under these reinsuring agreements\r\n\n-- the  so-called System and Non-System  (\"SANS\") Treaties --\r\n\nmany  syndicates  at Lloyd's  of  London  and other  overseas\r\n\nreinsurance entities (some of whom are the plaintiffs in this\r\n\ncase) agreed to  provide continuing reinsurance to NERCO on a\r\n\nportion of each risk it reinsured.   In industry terminology,\r\n\nNERCO, having been \"ceded\" the risks by the primary insurers,\r\n\nbecame    a    \"retrocedent,\"    the     plaintiffs    became\r\n\n\"retrocessionaires,\" and  the  agreements between  them  were\r\n\n\"retrocessional\" treaties.   The plaintiff  retrocessionaires\r\n\nagreed to indemnify NERCO  for a portion of any  losses NERCO\r\n\nmight sustain  in its  reinsurance of  primary insurers.   In\r\n\nreturn,  NERCO  promised  to  acquire  (\"produce\"),  evaluate\r\n\n(\"underwrite\"),  and price  (\"rate\") the  risks and  to share\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nwith plaintiff retrocessionaires, subject to its retention of\r\n\ncertain commissions, a portion of the premium it received.\r\n\n          A.  Signing the Treaties\r                          Signing the Treaties\r\n\n          In 1979, NERCO retained a U.S. broker, G.L. Hodson,\r\n\nto  assist it in arranging for this reinsurance on the London\r\n\nmarket.   Towards this end, Graves Hewitt, the CEO of Cameron\r\n\n&amp; Colby, and  his associates drafted  and circulated in  late\r\n\n1979 a  document  known as  the  Placing Information.    This\r\n\ndocument  stated that  Cameron  &amp; Colby  had established  the\r\n\nGraham Watson division after studying facultative reinsurance\r\n\noperations in North America  and after receiving the approval\r\n\nand support of the Hartford and ITT.5  The  stated purpose of\r\n\nthe division was:\r\n\n          1.   To participate in  the property  and\r\n               casualty   facultative   reinsurance\r\n               business    which    is    currently\r\n               dominated by the direct writers.\r\n\n          2.   To rationalise [sic] the facultative\r\n               placements of both the  Hartford and\r\n               the  First  State not  only  from an\r\n               administration  [sic] point  of view\r\n               but    also     to    provide    the\r\n               retrocessionaires with a broad cross\r\n               section  of facultative  reinsurance\r\n               emanating from these two companies.\r\n\nAccording  to  the  Placing Information,  Graham  Watson  was\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Plaintiffs'   fraud   claims   rely    significantly   on\r\nrepresentations made  in the Placing  Information, especially\r\nthose pertaining to Graham Watson's intention to procure non-\r\nbrokered, \"direct\" business from \"selected primary companies\"\r\nrather than brokers.  We attach  as an appendix a copy of the\r\nPlacing Information typically circulated to the plaintiffs.\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\ncharged  with  penetrating the  \"non-brokered  .  . .  direct\r\n\nprofessional  reinsurance   market,\"  leaving  \"[f]acultative\r\n\nreinsurance emanating  from reinsurance intermediaries  . . .\r\n\n[to] continue  to be written separately  through NERFAC,\" the\r\n\nlatter being an  existing in-house entity that  had, for some\r\n\ntime,  been  writing reinsurance  for  the  defendants.   The\r\n\nPlacing Information was circulated  to, among others, several\r\n\nEuropean  sub-brokers retained  by Hodson  to act  on NERCO's\r\n\nbehalf in seeking potential retrocessionaires.6\r\n\n          In late 1979, Hewitt traveled to London accompanied\r\n\nby  Thomas Hearn, a Hodson  employee.  Aided  by employees of\r\n\nsub-broker Sedgwick  Payne, they approached Ralph Bailey, the\r\n\nhead underwriter  for plaintiff Terra Nova  Insurance Company\r\n\nLimited, and described to  him the proposed reinsurance plan.\r\n\nSedgwick-Payne's  brokers  thereafter negotiated  with Bailey\r\n\nthe \"slips\" spelling  out the  terms of the  treaties.   With\r\n\nBailey agreeing to act as  \"lead underwriter\" for the  London\r\n\nmarket companies,  the brokers  approached  Ron Kellet,  head\r\n\nunderwriter for  plaintiff B.P.D. Kellet &amp;  Others, a Lloyd's\r\n\nsyndicate, with the  request that he act as  lead underwriter\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  These included Sedgwick Payne, North American Reinsurance\r\nBrokers Ltd.; Anglo-Swiss  Reinsurance Brokers, Ltd.;  Carter\r\nBrito E Cunha Ltd.; Fielding &amp; Partners; and Jardine Thompson\r\nGraham  Ltd.   None of  the sub-brokers  are parties  to this\r\nsuit.\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\non  behalf of all other Lloyd's syndicates.7  After the leads\r\n\nhad   stamped  and  initialed   the  slips,   indicating  the\r\n\nproportion of the total  risk they were bound to  accept, the\r\n\nslips   were  separately   presented  for  approval   to  the\r\n\nunderwriters  for  each  of  the plaintiffs,8  each  of  whom\r\n\nindicated his or her acceptance of a  portion of the risks by\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  A  lead   underwriter   is  initially   responsible   for\r\nnegotiating the  terms of  reinsurance contracts such  as the\r\nSANS Treaties.  The lead underwriter normally commits  his or\r\nher firm or syndicate to a level of participation in a treaty\r\nthat  is somewhat  higher  than that  of other  participating\r\nreinsurers, who  are referred  to as the  \"following market.\"\r\nMembers  of the  following  market rely  on the  underwriting\r\nskill  and judgment of the  lead as an  important factor when\r\ndeciding whether  and by  how much  to  commit themselves  on\r\nreinsurance   obligations.      Thus,   having   a  reputable\r\nunderwriter  as  lead can  have a  significant effect  on the\r\nability  to fully place a retrocessional  treaty.  There were\r\nactually  two lead underwriters in this case:  Bailey for the\r\nLondon  market   companies  and   Kellett  for  the   Lloyd's\r\nsyndicates.   See Edinburgh Assur.  Co. v. R.L.  Burns Corp.,\r                                                                        \r\n479  F.Supp.  138,  145  n.2 (C.D.  Cal.  1979)  (\"The market\r\nsometimes recognizes both a lead underwriter at Lloyd's and a\r\nlead company underwriter.\"), aff'd in relevant part, 669 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n1259 (9th Cir. 1982).\r\n\n8.  Not all  of the 31  plaintiffs participated  in all  four\r\nyears  of  the   SANS  Treaties.    (28  of   the  plaintiffs\r\nparticipated in  the 1980  SANS Treaties; 29  participated in\r\n1981; 27 participated in 1982;  and 15 participated in 1983.)\r\nHowever, the process of stamping and initialling the slips to\r\nindicate  acceptance of a portion of the risk was repeated in\r\neach of the following  three years (1981-83) with respect  to\r\neach individual plaintiff.  We  also note that the plaintiffs\r\nwere not the only retrocessionaires participating in the SANS\r\nTreaties;  in   all,  approximately  100   separate  entities\r\naccepted portions  of  these risks  over  the four  years  in\r\nquestion.\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\ninitialing the slip.9\r\n\n          These  slips constituted, in  abbreviated form, the\r\n\ncontracts   between  the   cedent   NERCO  and   the  various\r\n\nretrocessionaires.10      Briefly   summarized,   the   slips\r\n\nprovided  that  the  subject   matter  of  the  Treaties  was\r\n\n\"Business classified by the Reassured [NERCO] as Property and\r\n\nCasualty   Facultative   Assumed   business    produced   and\r\n\nunderwritten by the Graham Watson division of Cameron &amp; Colby\r\n\nCo.,  Inc.\"  They also  stated that the  Lead Underwriter had\r\n\nauthority to require exclusion of certain types of risks, and\r\n\nto agree to the final wording  of the formal contract.  NERCO\r\n\nwas  to retain a minimum of  $250,000 of each risk ceded, and\r\n\nas  respects system  business (i.e.,  risks written  by First\r\n\nState and  other Hartford entities,  infra), was not  to cede\r                                                      \r\n\nmore than 50 percent of the original reinsurance limit of any\r\n\ngiven risk to  the Treaties,  and was to  co-reinsure for  10\r\n\npercent participation  on  each such  risk.   The slips  also\r\n\nspecified   the  commission   structure  and   various  other\r\n\nconditions of the  Treaties.  The  slips did not  incorporate\r\n\nthe Placing Information as such.\r\n\n          Each   underwriter   subsequently   signed   Treaty\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  For a  detailed discussion  of the business  practices of\r\nthe  London insurance  market, see  Edinburgh Assur.,  479 F.\r                                                                \r\nSupp. at 144-46. \r\n\n10.  We  place in the appendix portions of one of the typical\r\nslips utilized here.\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\nWordings,   formal  contracts  containing  a  more  elaborate\r\n\nstatement  of the parties'  agreements.  These  were based on\r\n\nthe slips, and  the parties agreed that, in the  event of any\r\n\ninconsistency,  the slips  would control.   The first  set of\r\n\nSANS Treaties ran for the eleven month period from February 1\r\n\nthrough December 31, 1980.   Thereafter, those plaintiffs who\r\n\ndesired  to   continue  for  another  year   indicated  their\r\n\nwillingness to  join by initialling new  slips and ultimately\r\n\nexecuting new Treaty Wordings  for 1981.  Successive Treaties\r\n\nwere entered  into  for  1982 and  for  1983.   Some  of  the\r\n\nplaintiffs  entered into Treaties for each of the four years;\r\n\nothers were parties  to the  Treaties for only  one, two,  or\r\n\nthree   of  those   years.    The   Treaties  were   open  to\r\n\nrenegotiation each year, and  certain changes, e.g., relating\r\n\nto commission structure and the like, were in fact made.\r\n\n          For each Treaty year  there were actually two slips\r\n\nprepared,  one for  property  business and  one for  casualty\r\n\nbusiness.   The business  covered by  each  slip was  further\r\n\ndivided  into  \"system business\"  and  \"non-system business.\"\r\n\n\"System business\"  denoted risks written by  member companies\r\n\nof the Hartford, and included,  among others, First State and\r\n\nthe Hartford itself.  \"Non-system business\" referred to risks\r\n\nwritten  by any  other primary  insurer.   As a  condition of\r\n\nparticipation,   although  not   included   in  the   written\r\n\ncontracts, Bailey  insisted that  no  non-system business  be\r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\nceded to the SANS Treaties for the first year.   He testified\r\n\nin  his deposition  that this  was because  he felt  that the\r\n\nsystem  business  was  \"the  steadier,  better  part  of  the\r\n\nportfolio.\"\r\n\n          B.  Performance of the Treaties\r                          Performance of the Treaties\r\n\n          Once the  Treaties were  fully placed for  the 1980\r\n\ntreaty  year,  NERCO  began  retroceding  to  the  plaintiffs\r\n\nportions  of the  risks it  was reinsuring.   Central  to the\r\n\nplaintiffs'  present complaint, and  to the  district court's\r\n\nfinding of liability,  are the source  and nature of  NERCO's\r\n\nbusiness  as ceded  to  them.   In the  first  year, over  95\r\n\npercent  of  the  business  so  ceded  was  system  business.\r\n\nHowever,  few, if  any,  of  the  risks reinsured  were  from\r\n\nHartford companies  other than First  State.  In  the ensuing\r\n\nthree years,  the proportion  of system business  declined in\r\n\nfavor  of non-system business to less than 50 percent.  There\r\n\nwas evidence  that defendants had hoped  that system business\r\n\nwould  grow and  that NERCO  and its  retrocessionaires would\r\n\nobtain  more  reinsurance  business directly  from  the other\r\n\nHartford  companies, in  addition  to First  State, but  that\r\n\nthese hopes were not realized.\r\n\n          The proportion of non-system business rose steadily\r\n\nafter  the first year, but  the non-system business  was of a\r\n\nkind which plaintiffs contend,  and the district court found,\r\n\nwas  different   from  that   represented   in  the   Placing\r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\nInformation.  The court  construed the Placing Information as\r\n\nrepresenting  \"that Graham Watson  would produce 'non-system'\r\n\nreinsurance   business   directly   from  primary   insurance\r\n\ncompanies without the use of intermediaries.\"  In support  of\r\n\nthe court's construction, plaintiffs point to representations\r\n\nin the Placing Information that Graham Watson did  not intend\r\n\nto seek  reinsurance  \"on  a wholesale  basis  from  all  and\r\n\nsundry\" but  rather to  develop a close  working relationship\r\n\n\"with  selected primary companies.\"   The Placing Information\r\n\nstated  that non-brokered business \"placed significantly with\r\n\nthe  direct  professional  reinsurance market\"  characterized\r\n\nover  80 percent  of United  States  facultative reinsurance.\r\n\nThe Placing  Information also  stated that Graham  Watson was\r\n\n\"charged   with  the   responsibility  of   penetrating  this\r\n\nbusiness.\"  Notwithstanding these announced intentions in the\r\n\nPlacing Information, most  of defendants' growing  non-system\r\n\nbusiness  after the end of  1980 was, in  fact, obtained from\r\n\nintermediaries    to wit, brokers and Managing General Agents\r\n\n(\"MGAs\").  MGAs serve as agents of primary insurance carriers\r\n\nwith authority  to underwrite  and place certain  business on\r\n\nthe insurers'  behalf.   Defendants received the  majority of\r\n\ntheir non-system business, portions  of which were then ceded\r\n\nto the  plaintiffs under  the SANS  Treaties, from  Baccala &amp;\r\n\nShoop Insurance  Services, an  MGA representing a  variety of\r\n\nprimary insurance companies.   Baccala &amp; Shoop worked closely\r\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n\nwith the broker, G.L. Hodson; in fact, they were owned by the\r\n\nsame entity.\r\n\n          1.  Semi-Automatic and Automatic Facilities\r                          Semi-Automatic and Automatic Facilities\r\n\n          Another key issue  in the present  litigation stems\r\n\nfrom  the fact that, during the annual periods covered by the\r\n\nTreaties,  almost   all  of  the  non-system   business  that\r\n\ndefendants  produced, and  shared  with  the plaintiffs,  was\r\n\nunderwritten   using   what   are    called   \"semi-automatic\r\n\nfacilities.\"   (A  \"facility\"  is an  agreement setting  out,\r\n\namong other things,  the rules under  which a reinsurer  will\r\n\nreinsure  risks ceded by the other party.)  Defendants insist\r\n\nthat semi-automatic facilities were perfectly consistent with\r\n\nthe  representations  in  the  slips and  Treaties  that  the\r\n\nreinsurance  to be  ceded  to plaintiffs  would be  \"business\r\n\nclassified by the Reassured  [NERCO] as Property and Casualty\r\n\nFacultative   Assumed   business.\"     (Emphasis   supplied.)\r                       \r\n\nPlaintiffs   sharply  dispute  this.     Calling  facultative\r\n\nunderwriting the  \"fundamental  material  term  in  the  SANS\r\n\nTreaties,\" the district court agreed with plaintiffs that the\r\n\nterm \"facultative\" included only reinsurance that a reinsurer\r\n\nunderwrites  and negotiates  with  the primary  insurer on  a\r\n\nrisk-by-risk individual certificate basis in advance, i.e., a\r\n\ncertificate of reinsurance is issued  for each risk after the\r\n\nreinsurer has first looked  into and approved reinsuring that\r\n\nparticular risk.\r\n\n                             -15-\r\r\n\n          Under  the  semi-automatic  method that  defendants\r\n\nmostly used  in  underwriting non-system  risks,  defendants'\r\n\nunderwriters  did not evaluate risks one at a time in advance\r\n\nof  the issuance  of a  policy of  reinsurance on  each risk.\r\n\nInstead,    in    contracts   called    \"Master   Facultative\r\n\nCertificates\" (\"MFCs\"), NERCO agreed  with an MGA, broker, or\r\n\nprimary   insurer  that   the  latter   entity  could   issue\r\n\nreinsurance upon  risks of described types,  and upon certain\r\n\nconditions and  with  certain limits,  prior  to  defendants'\r\n\nunderwriters' scrutiny and approval  of the risk.   After the\r                                                                     \r\n\nreinsurance  attached to  each  risk, however,  the agent  or\r\n\nceding company would send to Graham Watson a \"risk bordereau\"\r\n\n    a  document  identifying   and  providing  a  summary  of\r\n\ninformation as to that, and any other, risks reinsured within\r\n\nthe  reporting period.  Graham Watson then had a brief period\r\n\nafter receipt of  the bordereau, for example 72 hours, within\r\n\nwhich to cancel the reinsurance on a particular risk if it so\r\n\ndesired, cancellation  to  take  effect  within  a  specified\r\n\nperiod, say, 14 days.\r\n\n          Defendants  contend,  and  presented   evidence  at\r\n\ntrial,   that  the   semi-automatic   facility  is   commonly\r\n\nclassified  in the  industry today as  a form  of facultative\r\n\nreinsurance.     They  concede  that,  in   an  earlier  era,\r\n\n\"facultative\"  was   a  term  applied   only  to  reinsurance\r\n\nindividually  underwritten on a risk-by-risk basis in advance\r\n\n                             -16-\r\r\n\nof binding.  But  while accepting that the  reinsurer's right\r\n\nto  reject  individual risks  remains  a  general feature  of\r\n\nfacultative reinsurance, defendants contend that this feature\r\n\nis  adequately   preserved  in   the   more  economical   and\r\n\nstreamlined semi-automatic facility.11\r\n\n          Defendants  also  used,  in   a  few  instances,  a\r\n\nvariation known as  an \"automatic facility.\"  Under this type\r\n\nof  facility,  rather  than  having the  right  to  cancel an\r\n\nindividual risk,  the reinsurer has  the right to  cancel the\r\n\nentire facility on very short notice.  Even without the right\r\n\nto cancel a  particular risk, defendants argue that  this was\r\n\n\"facultative,\"  since  the  reinsured would,  as  a practical\r\n\nmatter,  agree to  cancel individual  risks rather  than face\r\n\ncancellation of the entire facility.  Moreover, the reinsured\r\n\nretained  the freedom  to cede  or not  to cede  a particular\r\n\nrisk,  which   is  not   the  case  in   treaty  reinsurance.\r\n\nAutomatics comprised  only a small portion  of the non-system\r\n\nbusiness,  most  of   which  was  underwritten   using  semi-\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.  Because of  the cedent's right of  cancellation, and the\r\nreinsured's right  not to cede, defendants  and their experts\r\ncontend  that  the  semi-automatic  facility  is  a  form  of\r\nfacultative   reinsurance,  and  is  not  forbidden  \"treaty\"\r\nreinsurance.     The  SANS  Treaties   contained  an  express\r\nexclusion  for  \"assumed  treaty\"   business.    In  \"treaty\"\r\nreinsurance, the reinsurance arises solely as the consequence\r\nof the terms of  a prior general contract,  with no right  on\r\nthe reinsurer's part  to reject a particular  risk that meets\r\nthe  terms  of the  contract, and  without  any right  on the\r\nreinsured's part to decline to cede a particular risk, always\r\nassuming that the risk  in question conforms to the  terms of\r\nthe prior contract.  \r\n\n                             -17-\r\r\n\nautomatics.\r\n\n          2.  The First State Business\r                          The First State Business\r\n\n          With regard  to system business  (which was  almost\r\n\nexclusively with  First State), the defendants did  not use a\r\n\nrisk  bordereau,  nor  did  they ever  enter  into  a  formal\r\n\ncontractual  arrangement  spelling   out  First  State's  and\r\n\nNERCO's relationship in respect to the latter's reinsuring of\r\n\nrisks later  assigned  under the  SANS Treaties.   There  was\r\n\nevidence, however, indicating how matters worked in practice.\r\n\nIn  practice,  First  State's  underwriters  had  the   power\r\n\ninitially  to commit NERCO and the SANS Treaty signatories to\r\n\nthe reinsuring of individual risks primarily insured by First\r\n\nState.   The reinsurance was evidenced by a layoff sheet that\r\n\nFirst State  prepared; each  layoff sheet identified  a First\r\n\nState  risk that  NERCO  and the  Treaty signatories  were to\r\n\nreinsure, and  provided a brief summary  of information about\r\n\nthat risk.  A  packet containing many of these  layoff sheets\r\n\nwas periodically  provided by  First State to  Graham Watson,\r\n\nwhose underwriter could  study the risks  and would have  the\r\n\nright to cancel the reinsurance at will.\r\n\n          Defendants   contend   that    this   method    was\r\n\n\"facultative\" because each risk was individually evaluated in\r\n\ndue  course  by a  Graham  Watson  underwriter based  on  the\r\n\ninformation provided on the layoff sheets    and by follow-up\r\n\nphone  and face-to-face  inquiries, as  well as  by  means of\r\n\n                             -18-\r\r\n\nmicrofiches   which   reproduced    First   State's    entire\r\n\nunderwriting file for a risk, and were available upon request\r\n\n    and it was understood that the reinsurance was subject to\r\n\ncancellation at will by  Graham Watson.  They point  out that\r\n\nbecause  First  State's  and Graham  Watson's  employees were\r\n\nunder  the same roof and  answerable to the  same bosses, the\r\n\nlatter's  underwriters could informally influence First State\r\n\nnot  to cede  business the  latter did  not wish,  as further\r\n\nevidence  of their facultative  control.  Notwithstanding the\r\n\nabsence of a written  understanding between Graham Watson and\r\n\nFirst  State, the  district  court found,  after hearing  the\r\n\nevidence,  that,  \"Graham   Watson  underwrote  all  \"'system\r\n\nbusiness' .  . .  by the 'automatic'  and/or 'semi-automatic'\r\n\nmethod  of  underwriting.\"    Since  practically  all  system\r\n\nbusiness  was with  First  State, this  finding grouped  that\r\n\nunderwriting with the  explicit semi-automatic and  automatic\r\n\nfacilities used in non-system business.\r\n\n          3.  Further Performance\r                          Further Performance\r\n\n          At trial,  plaintiffs made  much of the  absence of\r\n\nproof  of  particular  occasions  when  defendants  had  ever\r\n\nactually  rejected a  risk listed  in a  bordereau or  layoff\r\n\nsheet.    Plaintiffs  also  sharply  questioned  whether  the\r\n\ninformation   in  the  bordereaux   and  layoff   sheets  was\r\n\nsufficient to allow for adequate underwriting (evaluation) of\r\n\nindividual  risks.  Defendants responded by emphasizing that,\r\n\n                             -19-\r\r\n\nwhether  or  not  used, the  right  to  reject  at all  times\r\n\nexisted, and  by pointing  to evidence that  its underwriters\r\n\nadequately reviewed the risks and had other means    personal\r\n\ninquiries,  telephone calls, inspection of First State files,\r\n\nand so on     to make inquiry in doubtful cases.  Defendants'\r\n\nevidence also indicated that Graham Watson conducted periodic\r\n\naudits of the  underwriting practices of  MGAs and others  in\r\n\norder to  assess  compliance with  the terms  of the  various\r\n\nfacilities.    The  district  court found  no  evidence  that\r\n\ndefendants  had  rejected any  risks  and  found that  Graham\r\n\nWatson's underwriting of individual risks was inadequate.\r\n\n          In  any  case,  while defendants  wrote  some small\r\n\npercentage of  reinsurance under  the SANS Treaties  that was\r\n\nfacultative in the traditional  sense of advance risk-by-risk\r\n\nunderwriting, most of the reinsurance produced under the SANS\r\n\nTreaties was  underwritten either  under some variety  of the\r\n\nsemi-automatic facility or, in the case of First State system\r\n\nbusiness, under  the informal in-house  procedures previously\r\n\ndescribed.  And, as  mentioned above, over the four  years of\r\n\nthe SANS Treaties, one MGA, Baccala &amp; Shoop, furnished almost\r\n\nall  of the  non-system business  to defendants.   Non-system\r\n\nbusiness was  found by the court  to constitute approximately\r\n\none-half of the treaty business during the four year period.\r\n\n          The agreement with Ralph Bailey to avoid non-system\r\n\nbusiness for the  first year was not to the  liking of Graham\r\n\n                             -20-\r\r\n\nWatson, whose employees  felt that non-system business  would\r\n\nbe a steadier source of income for the Treaties.  Bailey also\r\n\nmade  known his dislike of  MGAs and his  reluctance to allow\r\n\nMGA  business to  be  ceded to  the  SANS Treaties.    Bailey\r\n\ntestified  that, because  MGAs  did not  themselves bear  any\r\n\nrisk,   they  did   not  underwrite   as  carefully   as  did\r\n\nunderwriters on  the payrolls  of the primary  companies, and\r\n\nhence the  business  produced through  them  was of  a  lower\r\n\nquality.12    Again, this  was not  to  the liking  of Graham\r\n\nWatson;  one internal  memorandum,  dated December  11, 1980,\r\n\nstated that \"Ralph Bailey has an aversion to MGAs and he will\r\n\nhave to be  approached rather delicately because  a good deal\r\n\nof  the business going into this facility will be on business\r\n\nwhich is designed  to provide a real flow of  business from a\r\n\nsingle  source.\"  This memorandum also  noted that Tom Hearn,\r\n\nof Hodson, would  travel to  London on December  15, 1980  to\r\n\nattempt to  overcome this  aversion.  Responding  to repeated\r\n\nrequests from Graham Watson  employees, Bailey agreed at some\r\n\ntime  during  the first  year  to  begin allowing  non-system\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.  Conflicting points  of view were expressed  by insurance\r\nexperts  at trial  about  the relative  effectiveness of  MGA\r\nunderwriting, as filtered through  semi-automatic facilities,\r\nand   risk-by-risk  underwriting   on   a   \"direct\"   basis.\r\nDefendants offered evidence  that the losses sustained  under\r\nthe  SANS  Treaties were  less  than  those suffered  by  the\r\nreinsurance  industry  as a  whole  during  the same  period.\r\nPlaintiffs  did  not  attempt  to disprove  this  but  rather\r\ninsisted  that  the defendants  never  provided  the type  of\r\nreinsurance business they had promised.\r\n\n                             -21-\r\r\n\nbusiness to be  ceded to  the Treaties.   While he  expressly\r\n\nagreed  to the  cession of  certain  MGA business  during the\r\n\nfirst year (from  an MGA known as the London  Agency), he did\r\n\nso only with great  reluctance.  However, he did  not request\r\n\nor  insert  an exclusion  for MGA  business  in the  slips or\r\n\nTreaty Wordings for subsequent years, as he could  have done.\r\n\nNo such express exclusion was ever inserted.\r\n\n          4.  Renewal of the Treaties\r                          Renewal of the Treaties\r\n\n          The SANS Treaties were continuous contracts subject\r\n\nto  cancellation  \"upon  120  days prior  written  notice  at\r\n\nDecember 31,  1980 or  any subsequent December  31st.\"   This\r\n\nallowed  any desired adjustments to  be made in  the terms of\r\n\nthe Treaties  on a  yearly basis.   In practice,  all of  the\r\n\nretrocessionaires   cancelled   during  the   120-day  period\r\n\npreceding December 31, 1980 and then initialled new slips for\r\n\nthe next calendar year.   In order to induce  renewal, Graham\r\n\nWatson, again  through Hodson and  the European  sub-brokers,\r\n\ndisseminated a  document referred to as  the 1981 Anniversary\r\n\nInformation.    In addition  to listing  losses in  excess of\r\n\n$50,000 reported through September  30, 1980, and providing a\r\n\nsummary  of  the business  ceded  thus  far, the  Anniversary\r\n\nInformation included the following statements:\r\n\n          To   date,   the  preponderance   of  the\r\n          business  has  been  assumed  from  First\r\n          State Insurance Company  and written on a\r\n          pro  rata  basis.    Non-System  business\r\n          represents a  relatively small proportion\r\n          of the total and what has been written is\r\n\n                             -22-\r\r\n\n          limited to Casualty business on an excess\r\n          of loss basis  emanating from Baccala and\r\n          Shoop Insurance Services.\r\n\n          Because of the competitive climate in the\r\n          United  States, Non-System  business will\r\n          develop   more  slowly   than  originally\r\n          anticipated.    It  continues to  be  the\r\n          posture  of  Graham-Watson  not  to  seek\r\n          business  on a wholesale basis but rather\r\n          to  develop  close  working  relationship\r\n          [sic] with selected primary sources.\r\n\n          On  March 23, 1981, a meeting was held in Boston to\r\n\ndiscuss the performance of the SANS Treaties.  In  attendance\r\n\nwere Ralph Bailey and several  employees of Hodson and Graham\r\n\nWatson.  One major topic of conversation was the inclusion of\r\n\nMGA business.   Bailey  asked the Graham  Watson underwriters\r\n\nfor  their opinion of  Baccala &amp; Shoop,  and was told  by Bob\r\n\nWright, the  property underwriter,  that Wright knew  most of\r\n\nBaccala &amp; Shoop's home office people and was comfortable with\r\n\nthem.  Later in  the meeting, however, Bailey stated  that he\r\n\nwould not consider any new MGA business for the facility.  He\r\n\ndid  not, however,  make  this a  contractual requirement  by\r\n\ninserting  an exclusion for MGA  business in the  slip at the\r\n\nnext renewal.\r\n\n          At the close of the second year, a 1982 Anniversary\r\n\nInformation was disseminated, which  again provided a list of\r\n\nlosses and a  summary of  the business.   This document  also\r\n\nincluded  figures  as  to  overall  loss  experience  through\r\n\nSeptember 30,  1981, which  disclosed that the  SANS Treaties\r\n\nwere  losing  money.   Indeed, the  loss  ratio for  the 1980\r\n\n                             -23-\r\r\n\nTreaties  was an  alarming  248.65 percent.13   In  addition,\r\n\nthe  1982  Anniversary  Information  included  the  following\r\n\nstatements:\r\n\n          The  rating  basis of  these  treaties is\r\n          being  amended  with   effect  from   1st\r\n          January 1982 to  more accurately  reflect\r\n          the  basis  used by  Graham-Watson.   All\r\n          business other than that assumed from the\r\n          First  State which is  a \"system\" company\r\n          is being written on  a net rated basis in\r\n          that Graham-Watson is quoting their price\r\n          and if a ceding commission is required by\r\n          the  original company, this is then added\r\n          to the premium required  by Graham-Watson\r\n          . . . .\r\n          The  current sources of business is [sic]\r\n          as follows :-\r\n          FIRST STATE INS.

CO.\r\n          CHUBB AND SON\r\n          AETNA CASUALTY &amp; SURETY\r\n\nPlaintiffs point  out defendants'  failure to  mention, other\r\n\nthan in  the case of  Twin City, that  certain of  the listed\r\n\nprimaryinsurersactedthroughBaccala &amp;Shooporotherintermediary.\r\n\n          It appears  that no formal  anniversary information\r\n\nwas  prepared for 1983, the  last year of  the SANS Treaties,\r\n\nalthough  letters   were   sent  to   the   retrocessionaires\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.  Loss  ratio  is  the  ratio of  net  earned  premium  to\r\nincurred  losses.    A  loss  ratio under  100%  indicates  a\r\nprofitable treaty;  a loss ratio greater  than 100% indicates\r\nthat more money is being paid to satisfy claims than is being\r\nmade in the form of premiums.\r\n\n                             -24-\r\r\n\ncontaining a list of  losses, a summary of the  business, and\r\n\nnotification of various  changes that had been made  over the\r\n\npast year, none  of which  are material here.   However,  the\r\n\nretrocessionaires   were  told   that   the   treaties   were\r\n\n\"continuing for 1983 basically as before.\"\r\n\n          Following  the placing  of the  SANS Treaties,  the\r\n\nplaintiffs at first accepted their shares of the premiums and\r\n\npaid their shares of  corresponding losses incurred by NERCO.\r\n\nThe  losses were  considerable, as  they were  throughout the\r\n\ninsurance industry at this  time.  Beginning as early  as the\r\n\nfourth quarter  of 1982,  however, certain of  the plaintiffs\r\n\nceased  paying losses.14   There  was evidence  that some  of\r\n\nthe plaintiffs (in addition to Terra Nova, through Bailey, as\r\n\nrelated  above) began to inquire  as early as  1982 about the\r\n\nuse  of MGAs  to  obtain business  (rather  than through  the\r\n\nformation of direct relationships with primary insurers), and\r\n\nabout the underwriting methods used by the defendants.\r\n\n          C.  The Present Lawsuit  \r                          The Present Lawsuit\r\n\n          In 1985,  some of  the plaintiffs retained  counsel\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.  The  district court  made no  findings as  to  when each\r\nindividual plaintiff first refused to make payments on losses\r\nincurred.   The plaintiffs  introduced evidence  which showed\r\nthe  last quarter in which  each plaintiff made  a payment to\r\nthe Defendants.   The  earliest was Kansa  Reinsurance, which\r\nmade  its last  payment in  the fourth  quarter of  1982; the\r\nlatest were nine plaintiffs including Uni  Storebrand, Sampo,\r\nand the  seven companies  bound through  Aurora Underwriters,\r\nall  of whom made their last payments some time in the fourth\r\nquarter of 1986.\r\n\n                             -25-\r\r\n\nand  sought to  conduct a  preliminary inspection  of NERCO's\r\n\nbooks pursuant to a provision in the Treaty Wordings allowing\r\n\na  right  of inspection  \"at  all  reasonable times  for  the\r\n\npurpose  of obtaining information concerning this contract or\r\n\nthe  subject matter  thereof.\"   NERCO  allowed  a seven  day\r\n\npreliminary inspection  in the fall  of 1985,  but a  dispute\r\n\nthen  arose between  the  parties  concerning the  conditions\r\n\nunder which any further inspection was to be conducted.\r\n\n          Evidently  dissatisfied with  the  results of  this\r\n\ninspection, and  concerned about  the growing loss  ratios of\r\n\nthe SANS  Treaties, a  group of sixteen  plaintiffs (of  whom\r\n\nseven are  no longer  parties) commenced this  action against\r\n\nNERCO  on January  6, 1987.   They  alleged  that they  had a\r\n\ncontractual  right  under  the treaties  to  inspect  NERCO's\r\n\nrecords, and  that although  they had previously  conducted a\r\n\nseven  day inspection, a  further, more exhaustive evaluation\r\n\nwas  needed.    They  sought   an  order  compelling  a   new\r\n\ninspection.   On February  13, 1987,  the  parties entered  a\r\n\nvoluntary stipulation allowing,  and establishing  procedures\r\n\nfor, a further inspection to be conducted by  Roy T. Ward and\r\n\nfour  of his employees.   On February 27,  1987, the district\r\n\ncourt entered  an order  allowing the inspection  to continue\r\n\npursuant to that stipulation.\r\n\n          Meanwhile,  in   late  1986  a   second  group   of\r\n\nreinsurers that had  continued to pay  losses to NERCO  while\r\n\n                             -26-\r\r\n\nthe  parties  discussed the  possibility  of  a commutation15\r\n\nretained a reinsurance inspection firm, Palange &amp; Associates,\r\n\nto inspect  NERCO's books  and records.   The  inspection was\r\n\nconducted in Boston in 1987.  Again, disputes arose as to the\r\n\nscope  and  methods of  this  inspection;  however, no  court\r\n\naction  was  required  to  resolve these  disputes,  and  Mr.\r\n\nPalange completed his inspection in the spring of 1988.\r\n\n          Following these inspections, on July  12, 1988, the\r\n\noriginal  plaintiffs,  now joined  by  the  remainder of  the\r\n\npresent plaintiffs, moved to amend their  complaint.  The new\r\n\ncomplaint omitted the substantive allegations of the original\r\n\ncomplaint,  and deleted  the  plaintiffs'  request  that  the\r\n\ntreaties be enforced.   Instead, the plaintiffs asserted that\r\n\nthe  treaties  had  been  induced  by  fraud  and  should  be\r\n\nrescinded.  They also asserted claims for breach of contract,\r\n\nviolation of Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 93A,    2, and  the Racketeer\r\n\nInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18  U.S.C.\r\n\n   1961-1968.  Denying these allegations, defendants asserted\r\n\nthe statute  of limitations  as a defense  and counterclaimed\r\n\nfor recovery  under the  challenged treaties, and  for treble\r\n\ndamages, costs  and attorneys  fees under  Mass. Gen.  L. ch.\r\n\n93A,   2.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  A commutation  is a method of  terminating a reinsurer's\r\nobligation  to pay  future claims  in return  for a  lump sum\r\npayment.    It does  not  necessarily  involve  any claim  or\r\nadmission of wrongdoing by the reinsured.\r\n\n                             -27-\r\r\n\n          Prior  to  trial the  defendants moved  for summary\r\n\njudgment on the statute of limitations issue, as well as on a\r\n\nvariety of  other grounds not  important here.   The district\r\n\ncourt held a hearing on the matter on January 15, 1992.  In a\r\n\nwritten  order  dated  January  16, 1992,  the  court  denied\r\n\nsummary judgment  on the statute of  limitations ground, with\r\n\nno explanation.\r\n\n          A  jury-waived trial began  on April 5,  1993.  The\r\n\nstatute of  limitations was raised  again during trial.   The\r\n\ncourt  delayed ruling until it could \"find out what the facts\r\n\nwere.\"  On the  twenty-second day of trial, the  judge stated\r\n\nsimply that \"[i]t seems that there is no problem with Statute\r\n\nof Limitations.\"   However,  the court appeared  to entertain\r\n\nthe issue again  two days later, accepting  a deposition into\r\n\nevidence  after  defendants argued  it  was  relevant to  the\r\n\nstatute of limitations.\r\n\n          The  trial  concluded  on  May 19,  1993,  and  the\r\n\ndistrict court  entered a  memorandum and  order  on June  7,\r\n\n1993.  See 825 F. Supp. 370 (D.  Mass. 1993).  The court held\r                      \r\n\nthat  the defendants had induced the plaintiffs to enter into\r\n\nthe treaties  by means of fraudulent  misrepresentations, had\r\n\nbreached their contracts with  plaintiffs, and had engaged in\r\n\nunfair and  deceptive trade  practices in violation  of Mass.\r\n\nGen. L.  ch. 93A.   The RICO count  was rejected.   The court\r\n\n                             -28-\r\r\n\nmade  no  mention  of  defendants'   statute  of  limitations\r\n\ndefenses.16\r\n\n          By  way  of  relief,  the  district  court  ordered\r\n\nrescission   of  the  challenged  reinsurance  contracts  and\r\n\nordered defendants to repay to plaintiffs all sums plaintiffs\r\n\nhad  previously  paid  out  on losses  incurred  under  those\r\n\ncontracts with  credit for  premiums paid to  the plaintiffs,\r\n\nplus  prejudgment  interest  at  12 percent.    Judgment  was\r\n\nentered for the plaintiffs in June 30, 1993  in the amount of\r\n\n$37,501,701.12   plus   postjudgment   interest  and   costs.\r\n\nFollowing  several  motions to  amend  this  judgment, a  new\r\n\njudgment was entered on  September 21, 1993 in the  amount of\r\n\n$38,118,940.07,  which   listed  the   amount  due   to  each\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n16.  The district  court also made no  specific resolution in\r\nits  judgment  of  defendants'  counterclaims.    It  can  be\r\nimplied, however,  as defendants  state in their  brief, that\r\nthe court  dismissed the  counterclaims \"sub silentio.\"   The\r                                                                 \r\ncounterclaims sought  to  hold plaintiffs  liable  for  their\r\nunperformed reinsurance obligations imposed by  the treaties.\r\nWhile it would  have been  better practice for  the court  to\r\nhave denied  the counterclaims expressly, its intent to do so\r\nis apparent from its rescision of the treaties as having been\r\ninduced  by  defendants' fraud  and  breached  by defendants'\r\nactions.  We have held, in parallel circumstances,  that such\r\nelliptical judgments will be  deemed to adjudicate all claims\r\nfor Rule 54(b) purposes notwithstanding their failure to deal\r\nspecifically with  the counterclaims in question.   Joseph E.\r                                                                         \r\nBennett Co. v. Trio Indus., Inc., 306 F.2d 546, 548 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n1962); see Fed. R. Civ.  P. 54(b); 28 U.S.C.   1291.   By the\r                      \r\nsame token, we hold  that defendants, having acted reasonably\r\nby focussing their appeal on the district court's findings of\r\nliability, did not  forfeit the  right to  seek relief  under\r\ntheir  counterclaims  by  not expressly  appealing  from  the\r\ndistrict    court's    unspecified    dismissal   of    those\r\ncounterclaims.\r\n\n                             -29-\r\r\n\nindividual plaintiff, as  opposed to the  lump sum stated  in\r\n\nthe  first judgment.   The defendants' filed  their notice of\r\n\nappeal  from  the fraud,  contract,  and  ch. 93A  claims  on\r\n\nOctober  19,  1993; the  plaintiffs'  filed  their notice  of\r\n\nappeal from  the adverse  RICO finding  on November  2, 1993.\r\n\nMotions relating  to the plaintiffs' requests  for attorney's\r\n\nfees and costs are still pending in the district court.\r\n\n          D.  The District Court's Findings\r                          The District Court's Findings\r\n\n          In its  memorandum and order  of June 7,  1993, the\r\n\ndistrict  court  found  that  the defendants  made,  and  the\r\n\nplaintiffs  relied upon,  \"four material  representations\" to\r\n\nsecure the  plaintiffs' participation  in the SANS  Treaties.\r\n\nThese were:\r\n\n          1.   That Graham Watson would produce and\r\n          underwrite    property    and    casualty\r\n          facultative     reinsurance.         This\r                                 \r\n          representation mean[t] that Graham Watson\r\n          would   underwrite   reinsurance  on   an\r\n          individual,   risk-by-risk,   certificate\r                                \r\n          basis.\r\n          2.   That  Graham  Watson  would  produce\r\n          such reinsurance directly from system and\r                                               \r\n          non-system original  insurers without the\r\n          use   of   any   intermediaries.     This\r\n          representation mean[t] that Graham Watson\r\n          would  be a direct  writer of reinsurance\r\n          from   the    original   insurer,   which\r\n          reinsurance   cessions   would   not   be\r\n          brokered.\r\n          3.   That  the Hartford  Companies, along\r\n          with  First State,  would be  the \"system\r\n          business\"   original   insurers.     This\r\n          representation mean[t]  that the Hartford\r\n          Insurance  Group would  be the  source of\r\n          \"system   business.\"       The   Hartford\r\n          Insurance Group  is made  up  of the  so-\r\n          called   Hartford  Companies   and  First\r                                                               \r\n\n                             -30-\r\r\n\n          State,   an   excess  and   surplus  line\r                           \r\n          carrier.\r\n          4.   That   Graham   Watson  would   seek\r\n          facultative  reinsurance  business   from\r\n          selected  primary companies,  rather than\r                                       \r\n          on    a    wholesale    basis.       This\r\n          representation mean[t] that Graham Watson\r\n          would  assume  reinsurance from  selected\r\n          insurance   companies,  not   reinsurance\r\n          companies  or  Managing  General  Agents,\r\n          that  is,   from  risk-bearing  insurance\r\n          entities.\r\n\n825  F. Supp. at 376-77 (emphasis in original).  The district\r\n\ncourt  found that  although  business had  been assumed  from\r\n\nseveral  of the  Hartford Companies,  including First  State,\r\n\nHartford  Specialty Company,  Nutmeg  Insurance Company,  and\r\n\nTwin City Insurance  Company, all of  this business with  the\r\n\nexception of the First State business had  been classified as\r\n\nnon-system business.   The court  listed, as sources  of non-\r\n\nsystem business, a number of primary insurance companies, but\r\n\nalso  a number  of brokers  and MGAs,  and found  that \"[t]he\r\n\nmajority of  'non-system business' emanated from  Baccala and\r\n\nShoop,  a Managing  General Agent,  through the  intermediary\r\n\nG.L.

After a  further discussion  of Graham\r                                \r\n\nWatson's underwriting practices, the court stated:\r\n\n               Upon a review  of the evidence,  the\r\n          Court  finds that  Graham Watson  did not\r\n          facultatively   underwrite,    that   is,\r\n          underwrite   on    an   individual   risk\r\n          certificate basis as represented,  any of\r\n          the \"system business\"  nor virtually  any\r\n          of  the   \"non-system  business\";  Graham\r\n          Watson  underwrote all  \"system business\"\r\n          and  virtually all  \"non-system business\"\r\n          by   the    \"automatic\"   and/or   \"semi-\r\n          automatic\" method of underwriting.\r\n\n                             -31-\r\r\n\n               The Court also  finds, on the  basis\r\n          of the evidence, that  most of the  \"non-\r\n          system   business\"  emanated   from  MGAs\r\n          through  the  use  of intermediaries  and\r\n          from  intermediaries themselves,  and was\r\n          not  produced  from primary  risk-bearing\r\n          insurance  entities  directly.   Although\r\n          the plaintiff reinsurers were  aware that\r\n          Baccala and Shoop, an  MGA, had ceded  to\r\n          the  SANS   Treaties  approximately  five\r\n          percent of the  total business during the\r\n          first   year,   1980,  they   were  never\r\n          apprised that, during  the ensuing  three\r\n          years, Baccala  and Shoop would  cede the\r\n          majority  of  \"non-system  business\"  and\r\n          that other MGAs and  intermediaries would\r\n          cede,  in  conjunction  with Baccala  and\r\n          Shoop, most of the  \"non-system business\"\r\n          to  the  SANS   Treaties.     \"Non-system\r\n          business\" constituted, over the course of\r\n          the SANS Treaties, approximately one-half\r\n          of   the  total  business  ceded  to  the\r\n          Treaties.\r\n\n825 F. Supp. at 379 (emphasis in original).\r\n\n          With respect  to the plaintiffs' fraud  claims, the\r\n\ndistrict court stated that the plaintiffs understood that the\r\n\nterm  \"facultative,\" as used in  the SANS Treaties, was being\r\n\nused  in   its  \"standard  and   traditional  sense,  namely,\r\n\nunderwriting on a risk-by-risk  certificate basis.\"  It found\r\n\nthat NERCO was aware of this understanding on the plaintiffs'\r\n\npart, \"and was well aware that it, itself, was secretly using\r\n\nthe  term in  a special  sense without  ever disclosing  such\r\n\nspecial  meaning\"  to  the  plaintiffs,  and  that  this  was\r\n\ntherefore a knowing  misrepresentation.  As to  the breach of\r\n\ncontract claims, the district court found that NERCO  did not\r\n\nkeep, and never  intended to keep, its contractual promise to\r\n\n                             -32-\r\r\n\nunderwrite  risks obtained  directly  from  selected  primary\r\n\nsources on an individual risk-by-risk certificate basis.\r\n\nII.

The court  made no  findings and\r\n\nrulings whatsoever  on the important  statute of  limitations\r\n\nissues  discussed  infra,  nor,   in  general,  did  it  make\r                                    \r\n\n                             -34-\r\r\n\nsubsidiary  findings  resolving disputed  evidence.   Thus in\r\n\nfinding that  defendants  had committed  fraud  in  promising\r\n\n\"facultative\" reinsurance, the court stated that all  parties\r\n\nunderstood  that  term   to  mean  risk-by-risk,   individual\r\n\ncertificate underwriting,  but made no attempt to distinguish\r\n\nor explain  the great body  of evidence indicating  a broader\r\n\nmeaning.    Its finding  that  all plaintiffs  relied  on the\r\n\nPlacing Information is similarly  bereft of explanation as to\r\n\nhow this could be, given the absence of  proof of reliance in\r\n\na number of instances.\r\n\n          These  omissions  have required  us  to remand  for\r\n\ncertain  additional findings.   Where  possible,  however, we\r\n\nhave  disposed of key issues or, if that was impossible, have\r\n\nset out  a guiding legal standard for use on remand.  In sum,\r\n\nwe have endeavored to dispose of as much of the appeals as we\r\n\nproperly can at this juncture.\r\n\n          B.  Choice of Law\r                          Choice of Law\r\n\n          We dispose first of certain contentions raised with\r\n\nregard to  legal standards.  Plaintiffs challenge defendants'\r\n\nassertion that the SANS Treaties contain an express choice of\r\n\nlaw provision providing for  the application of Massachusetts\r\n\nlaw  to plaintiffs' common law fraud and contract claims.  In\r\n\nfact, Article XVIII of the SANS Treaties merely provides that\r\n\nif  a dispute  is  litigated, plaintiffs  will submit  to the\r\n\njurisdiction of  any court  of competent jurisdiction  in the\r\n\n                             -35-\r\r\n\nUnited States, and \"all matters hereunder shall be determined\r\n\nin accordance  with the law and practice of such court.\"  But\r\n\nwhile  plaintiffs' point is well taken, they go on to concede\r\n\nthat \"[i]n this case,  Massachusetts choice of law principles\r\n\ndictate the application of  Massachusetts substantive law  to\r\n\nplaintiffs' common law claims.\"  Given the parties'  (and the\r\n\nlower  court's)  general  acceptance  of  Massachusetts  law,\r\n\nalbeit  on  different  theories,  and  in  the absence  of  a\r\n\npreferable choice, we shall apply Massachusetts law except as\r\n\notherwise  noted.  See Bird  v. Centennial Ins.  Co., 11 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n228,  231  n.5 (1st  Cir.  1993)  (accepting parties'  agreed\r\n\nchoice of law where there was a \"reasonable relation\" between\r\n\nthe litigation and the forum whose law had been selected).\r\n\n          C.  The Burden Required to Prove Fraud\r                          The Burden Required to Prove Fraud\r\n\n          The defendants argue  strenuously, and the district\r\n\ncourt  stated, that  the  plaintiffs were  required to  prove\r\n\nfraud  by \"clear  and convincing  evidence.\"   The plaintiffs\r\n\nrespond  that under  applicable Massachusetts law  fraud need\r\n\nnot be shown by anything more than the ordinary preponderance\r\n\nof  the  evidence  standard  applicable  to  civil  cases  in\r\n\ngeneral.   Review  of  Massachusetts law  indicates that  the\r\n\nplaintiffs are right.17\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n17.  Defendants  also  argue  that,  because  the  plaintiffs\r\nadopted \"clear  and  convincing evidence\"  as the  applicable\r\nburden of proof  in the  district court, and  did not  object\r\nwhen defense counsel  stated their burden in those  terms, it\r\nis  now too  late for  them to  contest the burden  of proof.\r\n\n                             -36-\r\r\n\n          In Callahan v.

Recognizing  that the\r                           \r\n\nSupreme  Court required  \"clear  and convincing  proof\" in  a\r\n\nlibel case, the SJC nonetheless noted that,\r\n\n          the  words  \"clear and  convincing proof\"\r\n          had  not  been  discussed  in  our  cases\r\n          [other than in the libel context] because\r\n          the phrase had  not been used theretofore\r\n          in this Commonwealth.  Indeed, because of\r\n          the vagueness of an intermediate standard\r\n          of proof, we have  not looked with  favor\r\n          on the use of such a standard.\r\n\nCallahan, 372 Mass.  at 583, 363 N.E.2d at 241.

We conclude, therefore,  that Massachusetts  has\r\n\nnot adopted  a \"clear  and convincing\" standard  in cases  of\r\n\nfraud.\r\n\n          D.  The Duty Owed to the Reinsurers\r                          The Duty Owed to the Reinsurers\r\n\n          The plaintiffs argue, and the district court found,\r\n\nthat  the defendants were under  a duty to  the plaintiffs of\r\n\nutmost good faith (\"uberrimae  fidei\").  The defendants refer\r                                                \r\n\nto the same standard.  We agree  that a reinsurer like NERCO,\r\n\nhaving  obtained by  treaty the  power to  impose significant\r\n\nrisks  and liabilities upon plaintiff retrocessionaires, owed\r\n\nto  them  the utmost  good faith  in  its dealings  under the\r\n\ntreaties.

Thus,  the\r                       \r\n\ndistrict court properly required the plaintiff to prove that\r\n\n          the defendant made a false representation\r\n          of a material fact with  knowledge of its\r\n          falsity  for the purpose  of inducing the\r\n          plaintiff  to act  thereon, and  that the\r\n          plaintiff relied  upon the representation\r\n          as true and acted upon it to his damage.\r\n\nKennedy v.

The Fraud Claims\r                      The Fraud Claims\r\n\n          We  turn  now  to  the  substantive  issues,   and,\r\n\ninitially, to the  fraud claim  which is pivotal  to all  the\r\n\n                             -39-\r\r\n\ndistrict  court's  findings.    The district  court  saw  two\r\n\nfundamental  issues in the case, both of them relevant to its\r\n\nfinding  of  fraud.    One was  \"whether  Graham  Watson  did\r\n\nunderwrite  facultative reinsurance\"  on the system  and non-\r                                   \r\n\nsystem  business.    The  other was  \"whether  Graham  Watson\r\n\nproduced   'non-system   business'  by   establishing  direct\r\n\nrelationships    with   primary,    risk-bearing,   insurance\r\n\ncompanies.\"\r\n\n          A.  \"Facultative\" Underwriting\r                          \"Facultative\" Underwriting\r\n\n          Plaintiffs  argued, and  the district  court found,\r\n\nthat \"the parties to the contract\" (including, it would seem,\r\n\ndefendants themselves) \"understood the  meaning of that  term\r\n\n[\"facultative\"]   in  its  standard  and  traditional  sense,\r\n\nnamely, underwriting on a risk-by-risk certificate basis, the\r\n\nclassic  meaning  of  the  term.\"    825  F.  Supp.  at  382.\r\n\nAccording   to  the  court,   \"NERCO  knew\"  that  plaintiffs\r\n\nunderstood \"'facultative'  in  its standard  and  traditional\r\n\nsense of risk-by-risk  certificate underwriting and  was well\r\n\naware  that  it, itself,  was secretly  using  the term  in a\r\n\nspecial sense without ever disclosing such special meaning to\r\n\nthe Plaintiff  reinsurers.\"   Thus, the court  concluded, the\r\n\ndefendants'  representation  that   the  business  would   be\r\n\nunderwritten  on a risk-by-risk  individual certificate basis\r\n\nwas \"knowingly false when made.\"  Id.\r                                                 \r\n\n          1.  No Express Misrepresentation\r                          No Express Misrepresentation\r\n\n                             -40-\r\r\n\n          We hold that  these findings are clearly  erroneous\r\n\ninsofar  as  they  attribute  to defendants  an  implicit  or\r\n\nexpress representation that they would engage exclusively  in\r\n\nclassic  risk-by-risk,  individual certificate  underwriting.\r\n\nThe  record is without evidence from which a court could find\r\n\nthat   defendants   represented   to  plaintiffs   that   the\r\n\nfacultative business  underwritten by Graham Watson  would be\r\n\nlimited to individual certificate, risk-by-risk underwriting.\r\n\n          To be  sure, as the court found, there was evidence\r\n\nthat the overseas sub-brokers engaged to represent defendants\r\n\nby their broker, G.L. Hodson, understood \"facultative\" in the\r\n\nclassic  risk-by-risk individual  certificate  sense.   Nigel\r\n\nHuntington-Whitely,  the employee principally assigned to the\r\n\nSANS  Treaty placements by  defendants' sub-broker, Sedgwick-\r\n\nPayne,  testified  to  having  this understanding.    But  he\r\n\nindicated that  it \"may  have just  been an assumption,\"  and\r\n\ncould not identify the source of his understanding beyond his\r\n\nsense of what the term \"facultative\" might mean.  It was  not\r\n\nestablished that the sub-brokers were told this by defendants\r\n\nnor that prior to the initial (1980) Treaties the sub-brokers\r\n\ncommunicated this view to  plaintiffs or to defendants during\r\n\nnegotiations.\r\n\n          To  fill this gap,  plaintiffs point to Huntington-\r\n\nWhitely's letter of June 24, 1981 (well over a year after the\r\n\nTreaties  were entered  into), wherein  he states  in passing\r\n\n                             -41-\r\r\n\nthat \"Graham Watson is underwriting  each risk individually.\"\r\n\nHowever, this statement clearly did not induce the plaintiffs\r\n\nto  enter into  the 1980  and 1981  SANS Treaties,  given its\r\n\ntiming.   Moreover,  it is  arguable that  the semi-automatic\r\n\nfacilities, because they allowed Graham Watson's underwriters\r\n\nto reject  individual risks, were  a form of  individual risk\r\n\nunderwriting and thus not  necessarily inconsistent with this\r\n\nstatement.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs  also  point  to  the  1982  Anniversary\r\n\nInformation,  which  states  that,  on  non-system  business,\r\n\n\"Graham Watson  is  quoting  their  price  and  if  a  ceding\r\n\ncommission is required by the  original company, this is then\r\n\nadded to the premium required by Graham Watson.\"   Plaintiffs\r\n\nargue  that  this  specifically  describes   individual  risk\r\n\nnegotiation.  However,  it could  just as easily  be read  to\r\n\nrefer to  Graham Watson  quoting a  price during the  initial\r\n\nnegotiations  leading to  the  formation of  a semi-automatic\r\n\nfacility.  Thus,  it is  not an explicit  promise to  perform\r\n\nindividual risk-by-risk certificate underwriting.   Moreover,\r\n\nthis  representation,  like  the  statement   in  Huntington-\r\n\nWhitely's letter, was made  in 1981, and thus could  not have\r\n\nfraudulently  induced  the plaintiffs  to participate  in the\r\n\n1980 and 1981 SANS Treaties.\r\n\n          Defendants'   chief   executive,   Graves   Hewitt,\r\n\ntestified  at  the  trial to  having  told  one  of the  lead\r\n\n                             -42-\r\r\n\nunderwriters, Bailey, in 1979, about his dissatisfaction with\r\n\nthe method of using  a separate certificate as to  each risk,\r\n\nand his intention,  in connection with the  SANS Treaties, to\r\n\nuse a single controlling facility for multiple risks, as  was\r\n\nlater  done by means of the semi-automatic MFCs.  Because the\r\n\ndistrict  court found  -- contrary  to Hewitt's  testimony --\r\n\nthat  defendants had not disclosed  their intent to use semi-\r\n\nautomatics,  we  must  assume  that it  did  not  credit that\r\n\ntestimony,  although nowhere  in its  findings did  the court\r\n\nmention  and reject the testimony.   We do  not, in any case,\r\n\nrely upon Hewitt's testimony  in determining that the court's\r\n\nfraud  findings  premised  on  the  term  \"facultative\"  were\r\n\nerroneous.\r\n\n          Bailey  himself did  not attend  the trial  but was\r\n\ndeposed and  his deposition was read.   He did not describe a\r\n\nmeeting with Hewitt in  1979 nor any specific representations\r\n\nhaving  been  made  to him  prior  to  the  execution of  the\r\n\nTreaties  on the  character of the  facultative underwriting.\r\n\nHe testified  generally to \"understanding\" that Graham Watson\r\n\nwould assess and underwrite each risk separately, but did not\r\n\nrefer to any conversation or  occasion where any defendant so\r\n\npromised.   Asked if he would  have considered semi-automatic\r\n\nbinding  authorities to be  facultative underwriting, he said\r\n\nthat \"is not what I had intended and not what I had been told\r\n\nfrom my own  recollection.\"  This was the closest  he came to\r\n\n                             -43-\r\r\n\nsuggesting that he was  told by someone (defendants, brokers,\r\n\nor  others?) that facultative meant what the judge found.  We\r\n\nthink  this  vague testimony,  which  makes  no reference  to\r\n\nspecific sources,  falls short  of supporting a  finding that\r\n\ndefendants  expressly  promised  to  engage  in  risk-by-risk\r                      \r\n\nunderwriting only or knew that plaintiffs misunderstood their\r\n\nintentions in this regard.\r\n\n          2.    The Intended  Meaning  of  the Term\r                            The Intended  Meaning  of  the Term\r\n          \"Facultative\"\r                      \"Facultative\"\r\n\n          We similarly  hold  clearly erroneous  the  finding\r\n\nthat   defendants   \"knew\"    that   plaintiffs    understood\r\n\n\"facultative\"  to  be  limited  to  risk-by-risk  certificate\r\n\nunderwriting.    There  is   no  evidence  of  statements  or\r\n\ncorrespondence  by  plaintiffs  or their  representatives  to\r\n\ndefendants,  prior to  execution of  the slips  and treaties,\r\n\ninforming  defendants  that  the  plaintiffs  understood  the\r\n\nmeaning of facultative to be so limited.\r\n\n           Of course, if the court properly could have found,\r\n\non the basis of the evidence, that the term \"facultative\" was\r\n\nunambiguous, referring only  to individual certificate, risk-\r\n\nby-risk underwriting,  then defendants would  be charged with\r\n\nknowledge of that ordinary meaning.  However, as the evidence\r\n\nclearly showed, that term, both standing alone and as used in\r\n\nthe   Placing  Information,   slips,  and   Treaty  Wordings,\r\n\nencompasses  a variety  of  underwriting  methods, about  the\r\n\npropriety of  which the  parties and their  experts disagree.\r\n\n                             -44-\r\r\n\nWhether or not  a term as  used by parties  to a contract  is\r\n\nambiguous is  a question  of law subject  to plenary  review.\r\n\nITT Corp. v.

Boston Edison Co., 412\r                                                                    \r\n\nMass.  545,  557,  591  N.E.2d  165,  172  (1992)  (citations\r\n\nomitted),  a finding on which may only be reversed if clearly\r\n\nerroneous. Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).\r\n\n          As noted, the district court found that the parties\r\n\nunderstood  the  meaning of  the  term  \"facultative\" in  its\r\n\n\"standard and traditional  sense, namely,  underwriting on  a\r\n\nrisk-by-risk  certificate basis.\"   If  by this  finding, and\r\n\nothers  like it, the district  court meant that  the term was\r\n\nlegally unambiguous,  being limited  in meaning to  only that\r\n\none type of underwriting,  it was wrong as  a matter of  law.\r\n\nExpert  testimony  and  treatises  presented  by  both  sides\r\n\nsupport  the  view that  the term,  as  used in  the industry\r\n\ntoday,  has  been   broadened  beyond   its  classic   roots,\r\n\nnotwithstanding  plaintiffs'  insistence  that   the  classic\r\n\nmethod is alone the proper one.\r\n\n          Most likely  the court  did not  mean the term  was\r\n\n                             -45-\r\r\n\nunambiguous  as a matter of law, but rather concluded, on the\r\n\nbasis  of  all the  evidence, that,  as  used in  the present\r\n\ncircumstances,  it  should  be  given  the  limited   meaning\r\n\nascribed.18  Yet  the district court  offered no reasons  why\r\n\nit gave  the term the  limited reading  it did.   Nor did  it\r\n\nexplain why it believed  defendants \"knew\" that plaintiffs so\r\n\nrestricted the term.   On the latter point,  it may have been\r\n\ninfluenced  by testimony  from defendants'  principal, Graves\r\n\nHewitt,  who  said he  had as  good  an understanding  of the\r\n\nLondon  insurance market as any American.  The judge may have\r\n\nfelt that,  possessing such  insight, Hewitt \"knew\"  that, as\r\n\nsome  English  witnesses  testified, \"facultative\"  would  be\r\n\nunderstood to mean  risk-by-risk certificate underwriting  in\r\n\nthat market.   But absent evidence that  Hewitt actually knew\r\n\nand  believed this,  such  a leap  would be  pure speculation\r\n\ngiven Hewitt's own contrary testimony.  \r\n\n          Moreover,   English   treatises   introduced   into\r\n\nevidence   by   plaintiffs  indicate   that,  notwithstanding\r\n\nplaintiffs'  witnesses, the  reinsurance industry  in England\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n18.  \"When the  written agreement, as applied  to the subject\r\nmatter, is in  any respect uncertain or equivocal in meaning,\r\nall the circumstances of the parties leading to its execution\r\nmay  be  shown for  the purpose  of  elucidating, but  not of\r\ncontradicting or changing its terms.\"  Affiliated FM Ins.

A leading English writer\r\n\non  reinsurance,  Golding,  describes  in  his  authoritative\r\n\ntreatise   (introduced  by   plaintiffs)  various   types  of\r\n\nfacultative   reinsurance   other   than   the   risk-by-risk\r\n\ncertificate variety.   One variation Golding describes is the\r\n\nso-called \"cover in course of post.\"  He states:\r\n\n                    It  will be clear  that much of\r\n          the  labour  involved in  the facultative\r\n          method  is  connected  with  getting  the\r\n          necessary  initials  on  the  slips.   In\r\n          modern  practice  this  can   be  largely\r\n          avoided  by the  system  of  what may  be\r\n          called giving cover \"in course of post\" -\r\n          - though the term nowadays extends to the\r\n          use of telex communications as much as to\r\n          the mail.    The reinsured  will  arrange\r\n          facilities with a  number of  reinsurers,\r\n          whereby  it may  issue  request notes  by\r\n          post, for one or more  lines of a risk to\r\n          be  reinsured,  as may  be  agreed.   The\r\n          reinsurers will then hold covered each up\r\n          to  the amount  of its  agreed  share and\r\n          remains so bound, unless and until it has\r\n          signified its declinature  \"in course  of\r\n          post\".    As a  rule  a  limit is  fixed,\r\n          within which this must be notified say 48\r\n          hours  after  receipt,  though  sometimes\r\n          this  is  extended up  to  as  much as  a\r\n          fortnight to allow for possible delays in\r\n          transmission.  If  no declinature is made\r\n          within the period, the reinsurer is bound\r\n          in  the ordinary  way.   The  system does\r\n          save a  great deal  of work, and  is much\r\n          favored by reinsureds  accordingly.

Such an\r\n          arrangement thus partakes  partly of  the\r\n          nature of a  facultative reinsurance  and\r\n          partly of a treaty.   To the reinsured it\r\n          is   facultative  because   cessions  are\r\n          optional at its discretion.  . . . To the\r\n          reinsurer the open  cover is more  in the\r\n          nature of a treaty.  The obligation is an\r\n          obligatory one and it  applies not to  an\r\n          individual case  but  to all  cases of  a\r\n          given class that may be ceded.  No matter\r\n          how the  open cover may be  regarded in a\r\n          reinsurer's  books, it  is clear  that it\r\n          has  none  of  the  characteristics  of a\r\n          facultative reinsurance and in particular\r\n          it  lacks  the  fundamental feature,  the\r\n          power,   inherent    in   a   facultative\r\n          reinsurer,  to decline  a risk  if though\r\n          fit.\r\n\nGolding,  supra,  at  46-47.    The  open  cover,  as Golding\r                           \r\ndescribes  it,  seems  somewhat  similar   to  the  automatic\r\nfacility,  except that  under the  open cover,  the reinsurer\r\nlacks  the ability to cancel the contract on short notice, as\r\nit may under the  automatic.  As the somewhat  anomalous open\r\ncover is  \"generally regarded\"  as facultative, so  much more\r\nmight  the  automatic  facility  be  so  regarded,  since  it\r\n\n                             -48-\r\r\n\n          But  even ignoring  these indications  that English\r\n\ncustom and  practice  have gone  beyond  classic  facultative\r\n\nmethodology, it is the American,  not the English, usage that\r\n\nseems  to  us key.   The  underwriters  in London  and Europe\r\n\ncontracted  in the  slips with  defendant NERCO,  an American\r\n\ncompany, for reinsurance \"classified by the Reassured [NERCO]\r                                                                 \r\n\nas   Property   and  Casualty Facultative   Assumed  Business\r                                                     \r\n\nproduced and  underwritten by  the Graham Watson  division of\r\n\nCameron  &amp;   Colby,  Inc.\"    (Emphasis   supplied.)20    The\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nexplicitly includes a right to reject  risks by rejecting the\r\nentire facility.  Automatics were, in any event, a minor part\r\nof  defendants'  business,  semi-automatics  having  been the\r\npredominant mode.\r\n\n20.  At footnote 7 of its opinion, the court stated that this\r\nlanguage\r\n\n          was  understood  by  the  parties  to the\r\n          contract  as  providing   NERCO  with   a\r\n          limited  discretion  in  classifying  the\r\n          types of  reinsurance  and that  is  this\r\n          Court's  interpretation  on the  basis of\r\n          the evidence.\r\n\nIt is  unclear precisely what the  court had in mind  by this\r\nstatement.   There was  testimony that the  contract language\r\nmeant that NERCO had discretion to classify a particular risk\r\nas  either a  property or  a casualty  risk; there  was other\r\ntestimony  that it  was  standard language  which gave  NERCO\r\ndiscretion to  determine what business was  facultative.  The\r\nplain  meaning of  the language  seems to  us to  allow NERCO\r\nreasonable, though  not unlimited, discretion  to decide what\r\ntypes of reinsurance fit  within the stated classification --\r\nnamely,  as  \"Property   and  Casualty  Facultative   Assumed\r\nbusiness  .  . .  .\"   Determining  whether the  business was\r\n\"facultative\"  as  well  as  whether  it  was  \"property\"  or\r\n\"casualty\" would all  be included.

One  might argue that  the district judge  was\r\n\nentitled to believe plaintiffs' experts over defendants' (who\r\n\ntestified  to the  opposite  understanding),21  and to  infer\r\n\nthat  the ordinary  meaning  of the  term \"facultative\"  was,\r\n\ntherefore,  the traditional  one of  risk-by-risk certificate\r\n\nunderwriting.\r\n\n          But  the  evidence  that  the  term  \"facultative,\"\r\n\nwithin  the  American market,  embraces  more  than just  the\r\n\nindividual risk  certificate method  is simply too  extensive\r\n\nfor the  court to have rejected.  Normally, of course, we are\r\n\nbound by the district court's choice among competing experts.\r\n\nBut  it is hard to gainsay experts such as defendants' expert\r\n\nJames  Inzerillo, see  supra note  21, when  even plaintiffs'\r                                        \r\n\nexperts did not categorically deny the widespread use, within\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n21.  Defendants'   experts   testified   that   \"facultative\"\r\nincluded reinsurance underwritten  by the semi-automatic  and\r\nrelated  methods.    One  of defendants'  experts  was  James\r\nInzerillo,   the   former   president   of   Munich  American\r\nReinsurance Co., the United States branch of Munich Insurance\r\nCo., the  largest reinsurer in  the world. He  testified that\r\nindividual risk underwriting was \"by no means\"  the only form\r\nof  facultative reinsurance, and that MFCs and semi-automatic\r\nand  automatic  facilities  were  all  forms  of  facultative\r\nreinsurance.  Moreover, he testified that the largest direct-\r\nwriting professional reinsurers in  the country all used such\r\nfacilities  in   their  facultative  operations.     None  of\r\nplaintiffs/  experts categorically denied  the widespread use\r\nof such facilities in facultative operations.\r\n\n                             -51-\r\r\n\nthe  facultative  operations   of  American  reinsurers,   of\r\n\nfacilities  like the semi-automatics  and automatics  here in\r\n\nissue.   Plaintiffs' experts did  not, in fact,  testify that\r\n\nthe ordinary meaning of the term in the American  reinsurance\r\n\nindustry  was limited to  individual certificate risk-by-risk\r\n\nunderwriting.   Rather they intimated that  this was what, in\r\n\ntheir own opinion,  the term properly  meant or should  mean.\r\n\nYet, the question  is not  the abstract use  of language  but\r\n\nwhether NERCO    having discretion under the slips and Treaty\r\n\nWordings    could reasonably classify the semi-automatic  and\r\n\nother  methods it used in its own operations as \"facultative\"\r\n\nand whether it committed fraud when it did so.\r\n\n          The best  approach to answering this  question lies\r\n\nin the  realities of  industry practice.

For instance, Langler, writing in America in the 1950's,\r\ndescribes  an arrangement very much like the MFCs used by the\r\ndefendants, which he places squarely in the facultative camp.\r\nHe says,\r\n\n          Such facultative business as is now being\r\n          done  by  Reinsurance  Companies  in  the\r\n          main,  is   transacted  under  Agreements\r\n          somewhat  similar to  the enclosed.   The\r\n          offices   ceding   the  business   either\r\n          prepare   binders   and/or   certificates\r\n          supplied by the Reinsurer or, if equipped\r\n          to  do so,  will furnish  reports of  the\r\n          business  on an itemized bordereau, . . .\r\n          . It is, however, the invariable right of\r\n          the Reinsurer (or should  be) to ask  for\r\n          the  cancellation,  within  5 days  after\r\n          receipt  of advices,  of  any cession  or\r\n          cessions submitted under the terms of the\r\n          agreement,  otherwise the  reinsurance is\r\n\n                             -53-\r\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          considered binding  on both parties.

This  clause is not  dissimilar to cancellation\r               \r\nclauses  found in the MFCs  used by the  defendants to assume\r\nbusiness.\r\n\n          The district court quoted  from 2 Klaus Gerathewohl\r\net  al.,   Reinsurance  Principles  and   Practice  1   (John\r                                                              \r\nChristofer La Bonte trans., 1980) in support of its view that\r\nsemi-automatic  and automatic facilities are not a legitimate\r\nform of facultative reinsurance.   Gerathewohl does state, as\r\na general proposition,  that facultative reinsurance  \"always\r\ncovers  a single  risk.\"   However, he  states, in  a section\r\nentitled   \"The   management   of   facultative   reinsurance\r\nbusiness,\"  that \"[i]n  order  to keep  the direct  insurer's\r\nmanagement  and  administration  operations  for  facultative\r\nreinsurance  business  at  a  minimum,  it  is  essential  to\r\nrationalize  -  ie  [sic]  standardize    -  all  operational\r                       \r\nprocesses  as far  as  the individual  nature of  facultative\r\nreinsurance  will allow.\"  Id. at 12 (emphasis added).  Among\r                                          \r\nthe   methods  used   \"particularly  by   large  professional\r\nreinsurance  companies  that  specialize in  the  facultative\r\nbusiness,\" id. at 13, is the following:\r                          \r\n\n          Application   of    General   Terms   and\r\n          Conditions  of   Facultative  Reinsurance\r\n          containing general principles  applicable\r\n          to all cessions  made.  Such streamlining\r\n          and   standardization    of   facultative\r\n          reinsurance    agreements    avoids   the\r\n\n                             -54-\r\r\n\nthat, in  recent times,   the term  \"facultative reinsurance\"\r\n\nincludes methods,  in  addition to  traditional  risk-by-risk\r\n\ncertificate  underwriting, similar  in  concept to  the semi-\r\n\nautomatics.\r\n\n          Given this body of evidence,  including plaintiffs'\r\n\nexpert's  concession  as to  the  classification,  we see  no\r\n\nadequate basis,  from the term \"facultative\"  itself, for the\r\n\njudge  to  infer   that  defendants  necessarily  knew   that\r\n\nplaintiffs  would or should  interpret \"facultative,\" as used\r\n\nin  the slips and Treaty Wordings, as limited solely to risk-\r\n\nby-risk certificate  underwriting.   While the latter  is the\r\n\noriginal and classic method, see  Unigard, 4 F.3d at 1053-54,\r                                                     \r\n\nother  \"streamlined\" forms  are  clearly  now being  utilized\r\n\nwithin the  industry under the rubric  of \"facultative,\" both\r\n\nhere  and abroad, including types in  which the reinsurer can\r\n\nbe bound on individual risks by the reinsured acting pursuant\r\n\nto  the  terms of  a general  authorizing  contract.   Such a\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          necessity  to  negotiate  the  terms  and\r\n          conditions  on  each individual  case and\r\n          also  excludes  possible  cases of  doubt\r\n          owing   to   the   absence   of   express\r\n          stipulations.\r\n\nId.  at 14-15.  Thus, Gerathewohl cannot stand as support for\r               \r\na definition  of facultative  underwriting that  excludes all\r\nbut   individual   risk-by-risk   negotiation.      Moreover,\r\nGerathewohl  is  a  German   author,  writing  for  a  German\r\nreinsurance company.  His views, while probably authoritative\r\nin that context, cannot be taken  as authoritative over those\r\nof writers  more intimate with  the common  practices of  the\r\nAmerican reinsurance market.\r\n\n                             -55-\r\r\n\ncontract requires  the reinsured  to report the  placement of\r\n\nthe  reinsurance to the reinsurer via a bordereau; and it may\r\n\ngive the reinsurer the right,  within a specified time frame,\r\n\nto  reject   any  particular  risk  thereafter       but  not\r\n\nnecessarily  ab initio.   The  semi-automatics in  issue here\r                                  \r\n\nwere designed  along these lines.   Facilities employing this\r\n\nmethod were developed  to offset the paperwork and high costs\r\n\nassociated with classic  certificate facultative  reinsurance\r\n\nindividually   negotiated  in   advance  on   a  risk-by-risk\r\n\nbasis.24     The  hallmark  of   facultative  reinsurance    \r\n\nevaluation   of  each  risk  separately  by  the  reinsurer's\r\n\nunderwriter    is  sought to be preserved  by maintaining the\r\n\nright  to  cancel  after the  fact.    Although  a window  of\r\n\nexposure  is  created during  which  the  reinsurer is  bound\r\n\nwithout his consent on what the latter may later decide is an\r\n\nunacceptable risk,  the potential for damage  is minimized by\r\n\nthe  relative  shortness  of  the exposure  and  by  contract\r\n\nconditions which  prevent  the  reinsured  from  binding  the\r\n\nreinsurer to  predescribed types of risks  the reinsurer does\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n24.  The  First  State  reinsurance, as  the  district  court\r\nfound, fell within the automatic and/or semi-automatic method\r\nof  underwriting.    See supra  section  I.B.2.    The record\r                                          \r\nsupports that  finding, in the  sense that the  practices and\r\nunderstanding between  First  State and  Graham  Watson  were\r\ngenerally  analogous  to  those under  the  formalized  MFCs,\r\nalthough  the close  employment  settings may  have indicated\r\ngreater de facto underwriting control.\r                            \r\n\n                             -56-\r\r\n\nnot wish to cover.25\r\n\n          We  conclude that there  is insufficient support in\r\n\nthe record for the court's  key fraud finding that defendants\r\n\nknowingly   misrepresented  to  plaintiffs  that  they  would\r\n\nreceive  one type  of reinsurance  (the  classic risk-by-risk\r\n\ncertificate form  of facultative), while intending  all along\r\n\nto provide another type  (semi-automatic and automatic).  The\r\n\nevidence  does,  indeed,  support  the court's  finding  that\r\n\ndefendants intended to supply reinsurance underwritten by the\r\n\nsemi-automatic  and (to  a  minor degree)  automatic  methods\r\n\n(although  not   to  the   complete   exclusion  of   classic\r\n\nfacultative, a small amount of which was also produced).  But\r\n\nthe record  does not support the finding  that the defendants\r\n\nknew that the plaintiffs expected to receive only the classic\r\n\nrisk-by-risk certificate form of facultative reinsurance, nor\r\n\ndoes  it support  the  finding that  defendants made  knowing\r\n\nmisrepresentations with respect to the term \"facultative\".\r\n\n          3.

The   district   court    found   that    semi-automatic\r\nunderwriting   differed   from   the   classic   risk-by-risk\r\nfacultative method  in that  \"the 'right to  cancel' and  the\r\n'right to reject' are effective only at the time the right is\r                                                            \r\nexercised by  the reinsurance underwriter and  well after the\r                                                                     \r\nreinsured  risks had attached  to the SANS  Treaties.\"  These\r\nrights were  not effective ab initio.

Graves Hewitt's testimony\r\n\nindicated as much.  He testified that most of the facultative\r\n\nbusiness   in  his   company's   NERFAC  division   had  been\r\n\nunderwritten  in the  classic individual  certificate manner.\r\n\nHe  wanted  Graham Watson  to  switch  to the  semi-automatic\r\n\nmethod  in  order to  get rid  of  the paperwork  and expense\r\n\nassociated  with  the  classic  method.26   The  record  also\r\n\nbears  the inference (assuming, as we  infer, supra, that the\r                                                               \r\n\ncourt discredited  Hewitt's  testimony that  he  so  informed\r\n\nBailey in  1979)  that defendants  not  only did  not  inform\r\n\nplaintiffs     or their own sub-brokers    of their intention\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n26.  Hewitt testified that when he approached Bailey in 1979,\r\nhe did so intending to short circuit the  classic facultative\r\narrangements which NERFAC was using because \"we had mountains\r\nof paper to  file . . . .  I  made it clear to  Ralph we were\r\nnot interested in doing business that way.\"  The court, as it\r\nwas entitled to, apparently rejected Hewitt's testimony.  (If\r\naccepted, it  would have  seriously undermined any  theory of\r\nintentional  misrepresentation.)    The  testimony  at  least\r\nindicates  that  Hewitt was  well  aware  that the  MFCs  and\r\naccompanying  modes  of underwriting  were  in  some sense  a\r\ndeparture  from past  practice. There  was evidence  of their\r\noccasional  use by NERFAC in  the past, but  most of NERFAC's\r\nunderwriting was by the traditional facultative method.\r\n\n                             -58-\r\r\n\nto streamline their  underwriting, but kept this  information\r\n\nto  themselves.    Does  it  follow  from  this  that,  while\r\n\nnegotiating the  SANS Treaties, defendants  designedly failed\r\n\nto volunteer  to plaintiffs  facts  material to  the risk    \r\n\ni.e.,  their  intention  to  use  this  type  of  facultative\r                                                        \r\n\nunderwriting     \"which honesty, good faith  and fair dealing\r\n\nrequire[d] that [they] should communicate to the insurer\"?  9\r\n\nCouch   38:2.\r\n\n          Although argued by plaintiffs, the above theory was\r\n\nnot  adopted by the district court.  Instead, the court found\r\n\nthat   defendants  had   misled  plaintiffs  by   making  the\r\n\n\"knowingly    false\"    representation   that    \"reinsurance\r\n\nunderwriting   would   be    individual   risk    certificate\r\n\nunderwriting.\"   While there  is insufficient  record support\r\n\nfor such an express misrepresentation, it can be  argued that\r\n\ndefendants, being under  the duty to exercise the utmost good\r\n\nfaith, Unigard, 4 F.3d at 1066, were required to disclose, as\r                          \r\n\na fact  material to the  risk, their proposed  utilization of\r\n\nstreamlined facultative underwriting procedures  going beyond\r\n\nthe traditional method.\r\n\n          Couch states:\r\n\n          In effecting a  contract of  reinsurance,\r\n          it is incumbent upon the original insurer\r\n          to communicate to the reinsurer all facts\r\n          of  which  it  has  knowledge  which  are\r\n          material to the risk, and where it states\r\n          as  a fact something  untrue, with intent\r\n          to deceive,  or where  it  states a  fact\r\n          positively as true  without knowing it to\r\n\n                             -59-\r\r\n\n          be true, and which tends  to mislead, the\r\n          policy is avoided where such statement or\r\n          fact materially affects  the risk;  also,\r\n          any  undue   concealment  or  intentional\r\n          withholding  of  facts  material  to  the\r\n          risk,  which ought in  good conscience to\r\n          be communicated by the  original insurer,\r\n          avoids  the  contract, without  regard to\r\n          whether the knowledge or information with\r\n          respect to material facts was acquired by\r\n          the   original   insurer  previously   or\r\n          subsequently  to  the   writing  of   the\r\n          original contract.\r\n\n19 Couch   80:77.  While the above speaks of the relationship\r\n\nbetween  original insurer  and reinsurer,  we think  the same\r\n\ngeneral   principles  apply   between   a   retrocedant   and\r\n\nretrocessionares in a reinsurance treaty.  The question boils\r\n\ndown to whether a  failure to disclose plans to  deviate from\r\n\ntraditional risk-by-risk underwriting,  should be  considered\r\n\n\"undue  concealment  or  intentional  withholding   of  facts\r\n\nmaterial  to the risk, which  ought in good  conscience to be\r\n\ncommunicated. . . .\"   Id.

There is a \"wide distinction . . . between\r\n\n[the  insured's  duties in]  those  cases where  there  is no\r\n\ninquiry  and  those where  questions  are  propounded by  the\r\n\ninsurer.\"  Id.\r                          \r\n\n          Here there  is no indication that  plaintiffs asked\r\n\ndefendants during the negotiation  of the first SANS Treaties\r\n\nto  describe  what  types  of  facultative underwriting  they\r\n\nproposed  to  engage  in.    To the  contrary,  the  executed\r\n\ncontracts   expressly   allowed   defendants   a   reasonable\r\n\ndiscretion in  this regard.   And as we  have just  held, the\r\n\ntype  of underwriting  methods they  utilized, while  not the\r\n\nclassic form of facultative reinsurance, fell within industry\r\n\nparameters.\r\n\n          The  parties here  were of  equal power  and highly\r\n\nknowledgeable.  The slips and Treaty Wordings were negotiated\r\n\nby  and  between  sophisticated   reinsurance  professionals.\r\n\nWithout first being asked  by the other party, one  would not\r\n\nexpect defendants to volunteer a plethora of details on their\r\n\nproposed  underwriting practices.   Matters  would have  been\r\n\ndifferent had defendants  affirmatively misrepresented  their\r\n\nintended underwriting practices or given  incomplete, evasive\r\n\nor incorrect  answers to questions asked.  We see no basis to\r\n\ninfer \"undue  concealment\" from  their  failure to  volunteer\r\n\n                             -61-\r\r\n\nfurther    information    about   facultative    underwriting\r\n\ncharacteristics where, for all  that appears, the subject was\r\n\nnot broached.\r\n\n          The  slips,  as said,  were  worded so  as  to vest\r\n\ndiscretion in NERCO as  to the business it would  classify as\r\n\n\"facultative,\" indicating a willingness  to leave this choice\r\n\nto  NERCO.  As previously discussed, NERCO's choice had to be\r\n\nreasonable  and exercised in  good faith.   Salem  Glass, 343\r                                                                    \r\n\nMass. at 106, 176 N.E.2d  at 32-33; Johnson, 754 F.2d at  26.\r                                                       \r\n\nBut, within those  limits, the decision  was left in  NERCO's\r\n\nhands.    To say  that  NERCO  had  a  duty to  volunteer  to\r\n\nplaintiffs, unasked, the nature  of its proposed  facultative\r\n\nunderwriting facilities and, in  effect, secure their advance\r\n\napproval, goes  beyond the parties'  bargain as written.   If\r\n\nplaintiffs  had wished  to limit  defendants to  a particular\r\n\nfacultative  method,  that   requirement  should  have   been\r\n\ninserted in  the contract.  It  was not.  The  duty of utmost\r\n\ngood  faith should  not enable  a party, whose  bargain later\r\n\nturns  sour,  to  expand the  terms  of  an original,  fairly\r\n\nbargained  contract.27     Given   the  equal   strength  and\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n27.  To argue  that the plaintiffs'  underwriters were lulled\r\ninto not asking because they did not  understand the American\r\nmeaning of  \"facultative\"  is  surely  to  underestimate  the\r\nacuity of the London  underwriters who write insurance around\r\nthe world.   As  already mentioned, English  authorities like\r\nGolding, supra,  indicate that,  even in the  British market,\r                          \r\nstreamlined  methods  of  facultative underwriting  are  well\r\nknown.   But assuming different  considerations in reinsuring\r\nrisks in other  parts of the world, underwriters are expected\r\n\n                             -62-\r\r\n\nsophistication of the parties, and the fact that underwriting\r\n\nconsiderations  now in  dispute were  such obvious  topics of\r\n\ninquiry  had  plaintiffs wanted  to  know  more, we  are  not\r\n\nconvinced that  the  record  establishes  that  the  intended\r\n\nmethods  of proposed  facultative underwriting  were material\r\n\nitems of the type  defendants were required, without inquiry,\r\n\nto disclose.\r\n\n          However, even if the materiality of the information\r\n\nwere  such that  defendants should  have volunteered  it, the\r\n\nrecord  lacks evidence  from which  to find  that defendants,\r\n\nrecognizing its materiality, withheld it  deliberately rather\r\n\nthan through  oversight.  Claims in  fraud against non-marine\r\n\nreinsurers  cannot  rest  on  a  showing  of  mere  negligent\r\n\nconcealment.  Unigard, 4  F.3d at 1069.    The semi-automatic\r                                 \r\n\nand like  methods employed  were, as above  indicated, within\r\n\naccepted  parameters of  facultative classification,  and the\r\n\ncontract left their use to defendants' discretion.   Plans to\r\n\nuse  such  facilities  were  not  so  abnormal  as  to  imply\r\n\nfraudulent intent from the mere fact  of non-disclosure.  Any\r\n\nargument  that  plans  to   use  semi-automatics  had  to  be\r\n\ndisclosed because that method  of underwriting was especially\r\n\nrisky is belied by  the absence of evidence linking  the SANS\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nto  seek information  as to  the terms  and practices  in the\r\ninsured's  market  if  they  are interested.    Cf.

To the\r\n\ncontrary,  defendants presented evidence  which, if believed,\r\n\ncould indicate that  the losses under the  Treaties were less\r\n\nthan  the  industry  averages  for  the  period.28    It   is\r\n\nundisputed, as the judge stated, that the market in which the\r\n\nlosses  occurred  was  \"disastrous\" generally.    Substantial\r\n\ncontrary  evidence   was  not   introduced,  nor   was  there\r\n\nsubstantial evidence of large Treaty  losses from risks of  a\r\n\ntype that would likely not have been reinsured under the more\r\n\ndeliberate  classic  facultative  procedures.    We  find the\r\n\nrecord inadequate  to support  a finding that  in failing  to\r\n\ndisclose  their  plans  to  use  semi-automatic  and  related\r\n\nunderwriting  methods, defendants were acting with fraudulent\r\n\nintent.\r\n\n          We  thus  reject,   as  an  alternative  means   of\r\n\naffirming   the  court's  \"facultative\"  fraud  finding,  the\r\n\nfraudulent withholding  theory above discussed.   We conclude\r\n\nthat  the  court clearly  erred to  the  extent it  based its\r\n\nfinding  of  fraud  on  defendants' promise  to  produce  and\r\n\nunderwrite \"facultative\" reinsurance.29\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n28.

First,  that defendants  never intended,  when in\r\n\n1979  they  wrote  and  circulated  the  Placing  Information\r\n\ncontaining  the challenged  representations,  to live  up  to\r\n\nthem.   Second,  that when  later, during  the course  of the\r\n\nTreaties,   it  became  apparent   that  \"direct\"  non-system\r\n\nbusiness was unavailable, and defendants decided to seek non-\r\n\nsystem business through intermediaries, they did not disclose\r\n\n\"these material matters, as [they were] required to do.\"\r\n\n          1.  Fraud in the Inducement\r                          Fraud in the Inducement\r\n\n          The   first  theory   amounts   to  fraud   in  the\r\n\ninducement.   While the misrepresentations were of intentions\r\n\nas  to a  course  of action  in  the future,  the  deliberate\r\n\nmisstatement of present intentions can constitute fraud.\r\n\n          Present intention as to a future act is a\r\n          fact.  It is  susceptible of proof.  When\r\n          such intention  does not exist, .  . . it\r\n          is a misrepresentation of a material fact\r\n          . . . .   The  statement of  fact  as  to\r\n          present intention of the defendant, being\r\n          susceptible of actual knowledge and being\r\n          a fact alleged to have been false, may be\r\n          made  the  foundation  of an  action  for\r\n          deceit.\r\n\nFeldman  v. Witmark,  254  Mass. 480,  481-82,  150 N.E.  329\r                               \r\n\n(1926),  quoted in Barret Assoc.,  Inc. v. Aronson, 346 Mass.\r                                                              \r\n\n150,  190 N.E.2d  867, 868  (1963).   It is true  the Placing\r\n\nInformation  was   never  incorporated  into   the  contracts\r\n\n(consisting  of   the  slips  and  Treaty   Wordings).    But\r\n\ndefendants  prepared and  circulated the  Placing Information\r\n\nspecifically  to  induce   persons  and  entities  like   the\r\n\n                             -66-\r\r\n\nplaintiffs  to  enter into  the  Treaties.   Knowingly  false\r\n\nmaterial  statements  therein  inducing  reliance   would  be\r\n\nactionable fraud.30\r\n\n          Defendants respond that  the representation in  the\r\n\nPlacing  Information  of an  intention  to  \"develop a  close\r\n\nworking  relationship with  selected  primary companies\"  and\r\n\nrelated  statements  were   accurate  reflections  of   their\r\n\nintentions  when made.   In  support of  this, they  point to\r\n\nevidence  of their  efforts after  the Treaties  were entered\r\n\ninto  to   develop  a  working   relationship  with   primary\r\n\ncompanies.  They  also argue that at all times  they did have\r\n\nan ongoing  direct relationship with First  State.  Utilizing\r\n\nbrokers and  MGAs to provide NERCO  with reinsurance business\r\n\nwas said to  have occurred  only after it  was apparent  that\r\n\nthese earlier, sincere efforts had failed.\r\n\n          But the court was entitled to find otherwise, as it\r\n\ndid.  Anderson, 470 U.S. at 573-74 (if evidence is subject to\r                          \r\n\nmore than one reasonable interpretation, it cannot be clearly\r\n\nerroneous).    Before  the Placing  Information  was written,\r\n\nthere was  evidence that NERCO commonly  used intermediaries.\r\n\nStatements by  defendants' witnesses at trial  and in certain\r\n\nof defendants'  planning documents  issued prior to  the SANS\r\n\nTreaties suggest an  intention to  continue to do  so in  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n30.  Defendants challenge  the district court's  finding that\r\nall  plaintiffs  relied  on  these  misrepresentations.    We\r\ndiscuss reliance in the following section.\r\n\n                             -67-\r\r\n\nGraham Watson operation.   And defendants' efforts, after the\r\n\nTreaties were in place, to secure non-brokered business could\r\n\nbe found to be  predictably ineffectual, further suggesting a\r\n\nlack of intention to secure the direct business described  in\r\n\nthe   Placing   Information.      The   Placing   Information\r\n\nrepresentations,  it  might  be inferred,  more  reflected  a\r\n\ncalculated  effort to  entice  plaintiffs to  enter into  the\r\n\nTreaties than honestly  to project defendants' real  business\r\n\nplans.  While susceptible of another construction, the record\r\n\nadequately  supports the court's finding that representations\r\n\nin  the  Placing Information  as  to  Graham Watson's  direct\r\n\nwriting intentions were knowingly misstated.\r\n\n          Defendants argue  that even  though NERCO  may have\r\n\nused   intermediaries,  it  nonetheless   complied  with  its\r\n\nrepresentation  that  it   would  develop  a  close   working\r\n\nrelationship  with primary companies.   Defendants  point out\r\n\nthat the reinsurance it wrote with the  aid of intermediaries\r\n\ncame,  for  the  most  part,  from  highly  regarded  primary\r\n\ninsurance companies.  They also argue that the intermediaries\r\n\nenabled them  to develop  relationships with  these companies\r\n\nthat might, in time,  become \"direct.\"  But the  court, as it\r\n\ndid,  was  entitled  to   read  the  Placing  Information  as\r\n\ninconsistent  with the securing  of business  through brokers\r\n\nand MGAs.   The Placing  Information says, for  example, that\r\n\n\"[f]aculative   reinsurance    emanating   from   reinsurance\r\n\n                             -68-\r\r\n\nintermediaries will continue to be written separately through\r\n\nNERFAC.\"   While defendants seek to place a different meaning\r\n\non this, the  court was entitled to read this  as saying that\r\n\nbusiness through  intermediaries  would  not  be  handled  by\r\n\nGraham Watson.   And  there were other  statements supporting\r\n\nthe same impression.\r\n\n          The court was entitled  to conclude that there were\r\n\nsignificant  differences  between  a   \"direct\"  relationship\r\n\nbetween  NERCO   and   selected  primary   insurers   and   a\r\n\nrelationship by  brokers and  MGAs.  These  differences could\r\n\naffect the quality of the business, at least in some people's\r\n\nminds, and might  have caused some plaintiffs,  had they been\r\n\naware  of  defendants'  actual  plans,  to  reevaluate  their\r\n\ndecision to participate in the SANS Treaties.  In the case of\r\n\nbusiness  obtained  through  MGAs,  for   instance,  the  MGA\r\n\nunderwrote the risk  for the primary  insurer (as opposed  to\r\n\nthe  underwriting  being  performed  by  the  primary insurer\r\n\nitself);   communications,   premiums,   and  reporting   and\r\n\naccounting documents were routed through the broker.  The MGA\r\n\nwas not  at risk should an actual loss arise.  Bailey, a lead\r\n\nunderwriter, strenuously objected to business underwritten by\r\n\nintermediaries, regarding it as of lesser quality.  The court\r\n\nwas entitled to believe that the non-system business provided\r\n\nthrough Baccala and Shoop and others was materially different\r\n\nfrom the  business represented  in  the Placing  Information.\r\n\n                             -69-\r\r\n\nWe,  therefore,  affirm  the  district court's  finding  that\r\n\nmaterial and  knowing  misrepresentations were  made  in  the\r\n\nPlacing Information in 1979.\r\n\n          2.  Concealment\r                          Concealment\r\n\n          The court  also found  that NERCO \"never  disclosed\r\n\nthese material matters to the Plaintiff reinsurers as  it was\r\n\nrequired to do.\"   This appears to  be a finding that,  while\r\n\nthe  Treaties were in  effect, NERCO violated  its good faith\r\n\nduty  to  disclose  to   plaintiffs  matters  coming  to  its\r\n\nattention material to  the risk     most notably its  growing\r\n\nuse   of  intermediaries  for  non-system  business  and  its\r\n\nabandonment of the  plans set out in  the Placing Information\r\n\nto establish direct relationships with primary insurers.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnigard,  4 F.3d  at  1069.   This  trend, however,  was  not\r                   \r\n\ntotally unannounced  by defendants.  In  the 1981 Anniversary\r\n\nInformation,   defendants   revealed   that,   although   the\r\n\npreponderance  of that  year's  business was  system business\r\n\nfrom First  State, a \"relatively small proportion of the non-\r\n\nsystem business had been  written on an excess of  loss basis\r\n\nemanating  from Baccala  and Shoop  Insurance Services.\"   At\r\n\nthis  time,   Bailey was  already well  aware that  NERCO was\r\n\nreceiving the Baccala and Shoop business.  He objected to it,\r\n\nbut  finally went along for that  year.  Because Bailey was a\r\n\nlead  underwriter,  this  conceivably  (although  we  do  not\r\n\ndecide)  put all  the plaintiffs  for whom  he was  acting on\r\n\n                             -70-\r\r\n\nnotice that more  such business could  be anticipated in  the\r\n\nfollowing year,  yet  neither he  nor  anyone else  took  the\r\n\nsimple  precaution of  inserting  a prohibition  against this\r\n\ntype  of business in the renewal slips for 1981 and following\r\n\nyears.\r\n\n          The district  court dismissed the  1981 Anniversary\r\n\nInformation disclosure in the following finding:\r\n\n          Although  the  Plaintiff reinsurers  were\r\n          aware that Baccala and Shoop, an MGA, had\r\n          ceded to the SANS  Treaties approximately\r\n          five percent of the total business during\r\n          the  first  year, 1980,  they  were never\r\n          apprised that, during  the ensuing  three\r\n          years,  Baccala and Shoop  would cede the\r\n          majority  of  \"non-system  business\"  and\r\n          that other MGAs and  intermediaries would\r\n          cede,  in  conjunction  with Baccala  and\r\n          Shoop, most of the  \"non-system business\"\r\n          to the SANS Treaties.\r\n\nThis  finding  does  not  explain, however,  why  Bailey  and\r\n\nothers,  once on notice that business was being accepted that\r\n\nwas contrary  to representations in the  Placing Information,\r\n\ndid  not  continue  to  protest  and  try  to  head  off  the\r\n\nacceptance  of further  such business.   Moreover,  the court\r\n\nmade  no reference  to  other evidence  that  certain of  the\r\n\nplaintiffs may  have learned a considerable  amount about the\r\n\nnature and source of defendant's business during  the life of\r\n\nthe  SANS  Treaties.     Such  evidence  is  relevant,  under\r\n\ndiscovery principles, to the various statutes of limitations,\r\n\nincluding the three year  fraud statute, infra.  It  may also\r                                                          \r\n\nbe substantively relevant to plaintiffs' fraud claims and the\r\n\n                             -71-\r\r\n\nrecovery rights  of individual plaintiffs.   Although we have\r\n\nsustained  the  district  court's  finding   that  defendants\r\n\ndeliberately  misstated  their  business  plans  in  1979, if\r\n\ncertain plaintiffs renewed their annual participations in the\r\n\nSANS Treaties even after  becoming aware that defendants were\r\n\nusing intermediaries and lacked \"direct\" business, this could\r\n\naffect their right  to recover in fraud for subsequent Treaty\r\n\nbusiness, and might conceivably cast doubt as  to their right\r\n\nto  recover at all, on some theory of acquiescence or waiver.\r\n\nThese matters require  the making of  further findings as  to\r\n\nwhat  information  became  known   to  whom,  and  when,  and\r\n\ndetermination  of  the legal  effect  of  any such  knowledge\r\n\nand/or notice.\r\n\n          Therefore, although we affirm the  district court's\r\n\nfinding  that  knowing misrepresentations  were  made  in the\r\n\nPlacing Information, we direct that reconsideration  be given\r\n\non  remand  to  the  legal significance  of  the  information\r\n\nrevealed in  the 1981 Anniversary Information,  and any other\r\n\ninformation the court finds  was subsequently received by the\r\n\nplaintiffs, or  some of  them, as it  relates to  plaintiffs'\r\n\nrights  to abandon  their reinsurance  obligations under  the\r\n\nSANS Treaties,  and recover damages for  losses already paid.\r\n\nIn considering  such matters, the district  court should take\r\n\ninto account, among other  things, defendants' duty of utmost\r\n\ngood faith, the  identity of those plaintiffs affected by the\r\n\n                             -72-\r\r\n\nparticular  information,  the legal  effect on  plaintiffs of\r\n\ninformation possessed  by Bailey because of  his special role\r\n\nas  a lead underwriter, and  the fact that  the Treaties were\r\n\nrenewable annually.   The district court  did not discuss  or\r\n\nmake findings on these matters.  So as to leave a clear field\r\n\non   remand,  we   vacate   (without,  however,   necessarily\r\n\ndisapproving)  and  leave  for   further  evaluation  by  the\r\n\ndistrict  court,  the  court's  finding   that  NERCO  \"never\r\n\ndisclosed these material matters to the plaintiff reinsurers,\r\n\nas it was required  to do.\"  However, we  affirm the district\r\n\ncourt's   finding   that   the   defendants'   made  material\r\n\nmisrepresentations in the Placing Information regarding plans\r\n\nto obtain business directly from primary insurers and related\r\n\nmatters.\r\n\n          On  remand it will also be  necessary for the court\r\n\nto consider exactly  which of the SANS Treaties were infected\r\n\nby the  misrepresentations made in  the Placing  Information.\r\n\nThis question may be  affected not only by which  information\r\n\ncame to what plaintiffs during the term of the SANS Treaties,\r\n\nbut  also by  the fact  that the  business produced  by First\r\n\nState was  obtained directly, without the  involvement of any\r\n\nintermediary.    No part  of  that  business, therefore,  was\r\n\nseemingly affected by these misrepresentations although we do\r\n\nnot  foreclose the issue.  In  addition, because the district\r\n\ncourt  made  no subsidiary  findings  concerning the  various\r\n\n                             -73-\r\r\n\narrangements  under  which Graham  Watson  assumed non-system\r\n\nbusiness,    we cannot  tell  whether  all  of that  business\r\n\ninvolved the use of brokers and/or intermediaries, or whether\r\n\nsome  portion  of  it  was  obtained  directly  from  primary\r\n\ninsurers.   On remand,  the district  court should  take into\r\n\naccount  all  such  issues  in determining      assuming  the\r\n\nstatutes of limitations and other matters do not stand in the\r\n\nway of recovery    what relief to provide.\r\n\n          C.  Reliance\r                          Reliance\r\n\n          The district court properly listed reliance as  one\r\n\nof the  elements of  a common law  fraud under  Massachusetts\r\n\nlaw.  825 F. Supp. at 380 (stating that plaintiffs must prove\r\n\nthat they \"relied upon that representation as true and  acted\r\n\nupon it to their detriment\").   The court then found that the\r\n\nrepresentation that defendants would obtain business directly\r\n\nfrom  primary insurers was \"made  by NERCO with the intention\r\n\nof inducing the Plaintiff reinsurers  to enter into the  SANS\r\n\nTreaties, and,  in reliance on  said . .  . representation[],\r                                          \r\n\nthe Plaintiff reinsurers did enter into  the SANS Treaties to\r\n\ntheir detriment.\"   825 F. Supp. at 383  (emphasis supplied).\r\n\nThe court  made no  subsidiary findings which  would indicate\r\n\nwhat  evidence  it credited  in finding  that  all of  the 32\r\n\nplaintiffs31 relied. \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n31.  Thirty-two  being the  number  of plaintiffs  before the\r\ndistrict court at the time it rendered judgment.\r\n\n                             -74-\r\r\n\n          Defendants  challenge  this  finding, pointing  out\r\n\nthat a majority of the plaintiffs failed to present any proof\r\n\nwhatsoever that  they had  individually read and  relied upon\r\n\nthe Placing  Information.  Underwriters for only  some of the\r\n\nplaintiffs testified that they had relied upon the challenged\r\n\nstatements.  Plaintiffs conceded in closing argument that for\r\n\nmany of the individual plaintiffs there was no specific proof\r\n\nof reliance.\r\n\n          Reliance  is  an element  of  common  law fraud  in\r\n\nMassachusetts,  as the  district  court stated.   Danca,  385\r                                                                   \r\n\nMass. at  8, 429 N.E.2d at  1133 (citations omitted).   It is\r\n\n\"general insurance law\" that reliance  is an element of fraud\r\n\nin the  insurance context.    E.g., Foremost  Guar. Corp.  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nMeritor  Sav.

Supp. at 1247.   The Shapiro line\r                                                                    \r\n\nof  cases  relate to  what have  been called  \"warranties\" in\r\n\ninsurance law.  See  9 Couch,   36:1 (\"Generally  speaking, a\r                               \r\n\nwarranty in the law of insurance is a statement, stipulation,\r\n\nor  condition which forms a part of the contract, whereby the\r                                                            \r\n\ninsured  contracts  as to  the  existence  of certain  facts,\r\n\ncircumstances, or  conditions, the literal truth  as to which\r\n\nis  essential to  the validity  of the  contract.\") (emphasis\r\n\nsupplied).   Warranties are typically  enforced regardless of\r\n\nreliance.  In the  present case, the Placing Information  was\r\n\nnot a warranty.  It was neither incorporated in, nor attached\r\n\nto, the contracts eventually  executed, nor did the contracts\r\n\nthemselves  contain  any  promise that  Graham  Watson  would\r\n\nobtain  business  directly from  primary insurers.   Shapiro,\r                                                                        \r\n\nPahigian, and  Davidson were, in addition,  all cases decided\r                                   \r\n\nunder Mass.

Finally, in Shapiro, the court\r                                                              \r\n\nfound  that even if reliance were a required element of proof\r\n\nunder   186,  such reliance  would be found  on the  evidence\r\n\nbefore  the court.   Shapiro,  584 F.  Supp. at  1249.   This\r                                        \r\n\nobviously cannot be said here of those plaintiffs who did not\r\n\npresent individual evidence of reliance, infra.   Plaintiffs'\r                                                          \r\n\ncounsel  conceded in  closing  argument that  what he  called\r\n\nsubjective reliance by the underwriter who wrote the risk was\r\n\nnot  proven here in many  instances.  We,  therefore, find no\r\n\nbasis  in  Shapiro  for  making  an  exception  here  to  the\r                              \r\n\nMassachusetts requirement  that a plaintiff  seeking recovery\r\n\nin fraud must prove reliance on the misrepresentations made.\r\n\n          As  direct  evidence  of  reliance   is  admittedly\r\n\nlacking as  to many  plaintiffs, the question  arises whether\r\n\nthere may be circumstantial  evidence of reliance to  fill in\r\n\nthe gap.  We cannot find such evidence.  The plaintiffs were,\r\n\nfor the  most part, unrelated entities  from several European\r\n\nnations.  They  were approached  by no fewer  than five  sub-\r\n\nbrokers.  Defendants, it is true, concede in their brief that\r\n\nthe SANS  \"placing materials  were distributed by  the London\r\n\nsub-brokers to prospective  retrocessionaires, including  the\r\n\n                             -77-\r\r\n\nplaintiffs, in London and  Central Europe.\"  But  delivery of\r\n\nthe placing materials to a plaintiff is not the same as proof\r\n\nthat the  recipient looked at and  relied upon them.   Nor is\r\n\nthe fact  that certain other plaintiffs read  and relied upon\r\n\nthe placing  materials evidence  that all plaintiffs  did so.\r\n\nSeveral of  the plaintiffs were  unable to produce  copies of\r\n\nthe  Placing Information from their  own files, and many were\r\n\nunable  to present the testimony of anyone who could say that\r\n\nthe Placing  Information was seen  and relied upon  in making\r\n\nthe decision to enter into the SANS Treaties.  There was also\r\n\nevidence that, at  least as  to some of  the plaintiffs,  the\r\n\nsub-broker soliciting  participation and the  underwriter who\r\n\nmade the  decision to participate were  corporate affiliates,\r\n\nthus raising the possibility of some motive for participation\r\n\nunrelated to the defendants' inducing statements.\r\n\n          In  light  of  these  facts,  the district  court's\r\n\nfinding  that  all  plaintiffs  had  relied  upon  the  false\r\n\nstatements  in  the   Placing  Information  is   legally  and\r\n\nfactually insupportable and must be vacated.   We remand with\r\n\ndirections for the  district court to determine which  of the\r\n\nplaintiffs  have  proven  reliance  in  conformity  with  the\r\n\nrequirements of  Massachusetts law,  and to deny  recovery in\r\n\nfraud to any plaintiff who has not met this burden.\r\n\nIV.       Contract Claims\r                      Contract Claims\r\n\n          We turn to the plaintiffs' contract claims.\r\n\n                             -78-\r\r\n\n          (1) The slips called for the cession of \"[b]usiness\r\n\nclassified  by the  Reassured [NERCO]  as  . .  . Facultative\r\n\nAssumed  business produced  and  underwritten by  the  Graham\r\n\nWatson division of  Cameron &amp; Colby  Co., Inc.\"   As we  have\r\n\nheld, the character of the business ceded could reasonably be\r\n\nclassified  as facultative  business.   We find  insufficient\r\n\nrecord  support   for  the   court's  finding   that,  \"NERCO\r\n\ncontracted under  the SANS Treaties that  Graham Watson would\r\n\nexamine each individual risk submission by the ceding company\r\n\non  a risk-by-risk basis and, if the  risk be accepted, . . .\r\n\nwould  then issue  an  individual certificate  to the  ceding\r\n\ncompany.\"   We accordingly reject, as  clearly erroneous, the\r\n\ncourt's finding of breach of contract based upon the supposed\r\n\nnon-facultative  character of  the reinsurance  retroceded to\r\n\nplaintiffs.\r\n\n          (2) The district court further found that\r\n\n          NERCO   also  breached   its  contractual\r\n          obligation   to   produce  property   and\r\n          casualty  facultative  assumed  business,\r\n          for under the  \"automatic\" and/or  \"semi-\r\n          automatic\"  method  of  underwriting  the\r\n          reinsurance business is actually produced\r\n          by the ceding source companies and not by\r\n          the original reinsurer.\r\n\nWe  hold this  finding to  be clearly  erroneous.   While the\r\n\nprimary insured  or its agent  may indeed have  the authority\r\n\nunder the automatic or semi-automatic methods to initiate the\r\n\nissuance of the  reinsurance, this can only be  done pursuant\r\n\nto the reinsurer's authorization in  the MFC or other advance\r\n\n                             -79-\r\r\n\narrangement.    The  reinsurance  was clearly  \"produced\"  by\r\n\ndefendants  by negotiating and  setting up the  MFCs or other\r\n\narrangements under which the business was assumed.\r\n\n          (3)  The  district  court  also  found  that  NERCO\r\n\nbreached its  contractual  representation that  the  business\r\n\nwould be \"underwritten\" by Graham Watson.  The district court\r\n\nfound  a  contractual  breach because,  under  the  automatic\r\n\nand/or  semi-automatic  methods   employed,  \"Graham   Watson\r\n\ndelegated  its  reinsurance  underwriting  authority  to  the\r\n\nsource  company  to  automatically  cede risks  to  the  SANS\r\n\nTreaties.\"   The  district court  was undoubtedly  right that\r\n\nunder  the   semi-automatic  and  like  methods,  the  ceding\r\n\ncompany, or  the MGA  representing  it, was  given the  right\r\n\ninitially to assign  the risks  to NERCO, and  through it  to\r\n\nplaintiffs,  before review  by Graham  Watson's underwriters.\r\n\nHowever,  this was done  under facilities  previously entered\r\n\ninto with  Graham Watson, containing  underwriting terms  and\r\n\nrequirements satisfactory to the latter.  And, in the case of\r\n\nmost  of the business, Graham  Watson had the  right within a\r\n\nstated  time to reject any risk upon receipt of the bordereau\r\n\nor  lay-off sheet disclosing it, if the risk did not meet its\r\n\nunderwriting approval.   Graham Watson  was underwriting  the\r\n\nbusiness,  albeit using  the streamlined  facultative methods\r\n\ndiscussed earlier in  the opinion.   As we  have held,  these\r\n\nmethods  fall within  the industry's purview  of \"facultative\r\n\n                             -80-\r\r\n\nunderwriting.\"  Our decision on that point dictates rejection\r\n\nof  the   district   court's  above   finding,  which   rests\r\n\nessentially  on   the  erroneous  view  that   the  types  of\r\n\nfacilities   defendants  were  using  were  illegitimate  and\r\n\nunacceptable underwriting vehicles.  We hold, therefore, that\r\n\nthis finding, too, was clearly erroneous.\r\n\n          Having  said  this,  we   remain  troubled  by  the\r\n\nevidence, and the  court's findings,  of possible  systematic\r\n\ninadequacies  in the quality  of the  underwriting performed.\r                                        \r\n\nConceivably,  underwriting could  be  so deficient  as to  be\r\n\ntantamount to a breach of the duty to underwrite.  Plaintiffs\r\n\ninsisted, with support from their experts, that Graham Watson\r\n\nwas less  than diligent in its underwriting  efforts once the\r\n\nrisks were reported  to it by means of the  layoff sheets and\r\n\nbordereau.   There was evidence  of delay  and of  inadequate\r\n\nunderwriting data.   There was also some evidence that Graham\r\n\nWatson's underwriters may never  have rejected a single risk.\r                                           \r\n\nThe district court found that Graham Watson did not have \"the\r\n\nquantity or quality of information it needed to facultatively\r\n\nunderwrite the  risks  ceded to  the  SANS Treaties.\"    This\r\n\nfinding was,  to be  sure, based  on the  court's incorrectly\r\n\nnarrow  definition  of facultative  reinsurance,  and  was in\r\n\nsupport of  its finding  that Graham  Watson did  not perform\r\n\nfacultative underwriting.   Whether, under  this court's very\r\n\ndifferent  view of  the propriety of  defendant's streamlined\r\n\n                             -81-\r\r\n\nfacilities,  Graham Watson's \"underwriting\" could possibly be\r\n\nfound  to  have   been  so  inadequate  as  to   violate  its\r\n\ncontractual duty to \"underwrite\"  is a question we are  in no\r\n\nposition  to answer.   We  leave this  issue to  the district\r\n\ncourt, on  remand, with  instructions to also  decide whether\r\n\nother considerations     such as  the bar of  the statute  of\r\n\nlimitations    leave it viable.\r\n\n          (4) The district  court found that NERCO  \"violated\r\n\nits contractual  obligation  to 'co-reinsure  for 10  percent\r\n\nparticipation on  all 'System Business'  ceded hereunder,' as\r\n\nrequired by  Warranty No.  2 in  the Slip.\"   Warranty  No. 2\r\n\nreads as follows:\r\n\n          2)  Reassured [NERCO] co-reinsure for 10%\r\n          participation  on  all \"System  Business\"\r\n          ceded hereunder.\r\n\nThe plaintiffs  argue that this  term was  inserted into  the\r\n\nSlips at Bailey's  insistence because he wanted NERCO to keep\r\n\na  significant risk in  the business, thus  providing it with\r\n\n\"an increased incentive to exercise care and prudence in risk\r\n\nselection.\"  They then argue that in fact, NERCO did not keep\r\n\na  10   percent  retention,  but  instead   obtained  outside\r\n\nreinsurance of  that 10 percent  which reduced the  amount of\r\n\nrisk it  kept for itself to  a \"minuscule\" amount.   In other\r\n\nwords,  they  read  the  Warranty to  require  a  10  percent\r\n\nunreinsured retention.   The  district court appears  to have\r                       \r\n\nalso  read  the warranty  in this  manner;  this is  the only\r\n\n                             -82-\r\r\n\nreasonable reading of the court's statement,  as there was no\r\n\nevidence  that NERCO  did not  initially  retain at  least 10\r\n\npercent of each risk it ceded.\r\n\n          The  defendants  respond  that  Bailey's  testimony\r\n\nshows  that the  intent of  the Warranty  was not  that NERCO\r\n\ncould not obtain any reinsurance of its retention, but rather\r\n\nthat NERCO should have  exposure to losses that was  equal to\r\n\nor  greater than Bailey's  firm's exposure.   They  point out\r\n\nthat the evidence shows that, in fact, \"NERCO's actual losses\r\n\non  the portion of the  SANS risk portfolio  that it retained\r\n\n(unreinsured) was $105,000,000      an amount virtually equal\r\n\nto  all of  the losses  of all  of the  plaintiffs combined.\"\r                                          \r\n\n(Emphasis in original.)\r\n\n          We  believe  the court  was  entitled  to view  the\r\n\nevidence on  this point as  it did.   There is no  doubt that\r\n\nNERCO  did reinsure  some  portion of  its retention;  Hewitt\r\n\nadmitted as much, and the plaintiffs introduced into evidence\r\n\nsome of the reinsurance  contracts used by NERCO to  reinsure\r\n\nthe retention.  There  was also evidence on both sides of the\r\n\nquestion  whether  the parties  intended  Warranty  No. 2  to\r\n\nrequire NERCO to keep an  unreinsured retention.  While there\r\n\nare   no   contemporaneous   documents   using   the   phrase\r\n\n\"unreinsured  retention\" or words  of similar import, several\r\n\nwitnesses,  including  Nigel   Huntington-Whitely,  who   was\r\n\npivotally  involved  in   the  negotiation  of   this  point,\r\n\n                             -83-\r\r\n\ntestified  that  an   unreinsured  retention  was  what   was\r\n\nintended.\r\n\n          The  issue of  what  the parties  intended by  this\r\n\nlanguage is an  issue of  fact, which we  must uphold  absent\r\n\nclear error.   See Commercial  Union, 412 Mass.  at 557,  591\r                                                \r\n\nN.E.2d at  172.  We,  therefore, affirm the  district court's\r\n\nfinding of  breach of  contract on  this ground, subject,  of\r\n\ncourse, to any relevant findings the district  court may make\r\n\non remand concerning the effect of the statute of limitations\r\n\nand other material issues remaining open, infra.\r                                                           \r\n\nV.        The Statute of Limitations\r                      The Statute of Limitations\r\n\n          The  defendants  argue   that  \"virtually\"  all  of\r\n\nplaintiffs' claims should have  been barred by the applicable\r\n\nstatute  of limitations  defenses raised  below.   As already\r\n\nnoted,  we  have not  been  able to  find  in the  record any\r\n\nexplanation by  the district  judge of  his reasoning or  his\r\n\nview  of  the  law  and   the  facts  on  these   potentially\r\n\ndispositive  issues.   The  possible effects  of the  various\r\n\nstatutes  of limitations  on the  different claims  cannot be\r\n\nreviewed without  findings and  rulings based on  the record.\r\n\nWe, therefore, express no opinion at this time but direct the\r\n\ndistrict court, upon  remand, to consider  the impact of  the\r\n\napplicable statutes of limitations on the various claims, and\r\n\nmake appropriate findings and rulings.\r\n\n          The  parties  agree that  the  date  from which  to\r\n\n                             -84-\r\r\n\nmeasure the statutes  of limitations is  July 12, 1988,  when\r\n\nthe  plaintiffs first raised their claims of fraud and breach\r\n\nof contract,32 by adding these claims to their Second Amended\r\n\nComplaint.   The applicable statute of  limitations for fraud\r\n\nis three  years, Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  260,   2A;  Tagliente v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nHimmer, 949 F.2d  1, 4 (1st  Cir. 1991);  that for breach  of\r                  \r\n\ncontract is  six  years, Mass.  Gen.  L. Ann.  ch.  260,    2\r\n\n(1992).   The plaintiffs argue that each of these statutes is\r\n\nsubject to the discovery rule, meaning that a cause of action\r\n\ndid  not accrue  until the  plaintiffs learned  or reasonably\r\n\nshould  have learned of  the factual basis  for their claims.\r\n\nWhite  v.

If plaintiffs' claims  accrued prior  to\r\n\nJuly 12, 1982 (contract) or July 12, 1985 (fraud), and unless\r\n\nthe discovery rule applies so as to delay the accrual of  the\r\n\nalleged  causes  of action  beyond  these  dates, then  those\r\n\nclaims would have been barred.\r\n\n          There  are various  facts which,  if proven  to the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n32.  As  we say  below, the  district court erred  in finding\r\nliability under Mass. Gen. L. ch.  93A.  Therefore, we do not\r\ndiscuss the  statute of  limitations relevant to  that claim.\r\nNor, do we discuss the statute of limitations relevant to the\r\nRICO  claim because  we affirm  the district  court's finding\r\nthat RICO does not apply to the facts of this case.\r\n\n                             -85-\r\r\n\nsatisfaction  of the factfinder, might necessitate evaluation\r\n\nof  whether any  or all  of  plaintiffs' fraud,  and possibly\r\n\nother,  claims were  time  barred.   There  is, for  example,\r\n\nuncontroverted  evidence that  the  lead  underwriter,  Ralph\r\n\nBailey, had  personal knowledge prior to  1981 of defendants'\r\n\nuse  of  the MGA  Baccala  &amp;  Shoop.   Another  matter  to be\r\n\nexamined   is  the   disclosure  in   the  1981   Anniversary\r\n\nInformation, distributed  to the plaintiffs in  late 1980, of\r\n\nthe fact that business had been assumed from Baccala &amp; Shoop.\r\n\nThere are also in the record other indications of information\r\n\nbeing  conveyed to one  or more plaintiffs  at various times,\r\n\nwhich need evaluation to determine whether the running of the\r\n\nlimitations periods  was triggered at those  moments and with\r\n\nwhat effect.   For  example, some  of the  plaintiffs stopped\r\n\npaying claims made by NERCO as early as the fourth quarter of\r\n\n1982.  The plaintiffs were obligated to make such payments by\r\n\ntheir  own reciprocal duty  of utmost good  faith, unless, of\r\n\ncourse, they had knowledge of a bona fide defense to payment,\r                                                     \r\n\nsuch as the defendants'  fraud.

We  leave  entirely to  it,  in  the  first\r\n\ninstance,  the determination of whether and  how to apply the\r\n\nMassachusetts discovery  rule or  other relevant rule  of law\r\n\nand how to calculate,  on this record, the proper  running of\r\n\nthe applicable statutes of limitations.\r\n\nVI.       The Chapter 93A Claims\r                      The Chapter 93A Claims\r\n\n          In  a footnote,  the district court  found, without\r\n\nmore, that \"the  conduct of NERCO constitutes  a violation of\r\n\nChapter  93A,  Section   2  of  the   General  Laws  of   the\r\n\nCommonwealth of  Massachusetts.\"   825 F.  Supp. at  383 n.9.\r\n\nMass.  Gen. L. ch. 93A,   2 declares unlawful \"unfair methods\r\n\nof  competition and unfair or  deceptive acts or practices in\r\n\nthe conduct of  any trade or  commerce.\"   Mass. Gen. L.  ch.\r\n\n93A,   11 provides for the  bringing of a civil action by the\r\n\nvictim  of such  practices.   An action  may not  be brought,\r\n\nhowever,  \"unless the  actions and  transactions constituting\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n33.  For  example, Eric  Verhes  of Compagnie  de Reassurance\r\nD'Ile de France  apparently knew  of the use  of Baccala  and\r\nShoop  by  mid-1982; and  plaintiff  Imperio  Re exchanged  a\r\nseries of  letters with NERCO via the sub-broker Carter Brito\r\nE Cunha Ltd.  in late 1984 discussing the use  of Baccala and\r\nShoop,  and commented in one dated December 21, 1984 that the\r\nfact that business was \"underwritten by Baccala and Shoop . .\r\n. would appear to be a further point contravening the wording\r\nof the Contract.\"\r\n\n                             -87-\r\r\n\nthe alleged unfair  method of  competition or  the unfair  or\r\n\ndeceptive   act   or   practice   occurred    primarily   and\r\n\nsubstantially within the commonwealth.\"  Id.\r                                                        \r\n\n          The defendants  argued below  as they do  on appeal\r\n\nthat the acts and practices said to constitute a violation of\r\n\n   2 did  not  occur primarily  and substantially  within the\r\n\ncommonwealth,  as  required by     11.   The  district court,\r\n\nhowever,  made  no  finding  on this  important  point.   The\r\n\nclosest the  court came to finding where the critical conduct\r\n\noccurred  was a statement, in  the course of  a colloquy with\r\n\ncounsel, that it  was \"implicit . . . activities  had to have\r\n\nbeen found in Massachusetts.\"  The court went on  to say that\r\n\nwhile  \"there were  activities  within the  state that  would\r\n\nconstitute  a violation of  93A, as I  found . .  . there are\r\n\nmore important activities, more crucial  activities that took\r\n\nplace overseas.\"  We are thus left without a specific finding\r\n\nand with considerable confusion  as to what the court  had in\r\n\nmind.  Given the absence of guidance -- indeed, with guidance\r\n\nthat points in  opposite directions --  we must determine  as\r\n\nbest  we can whether  the   11  locus requirement  was met on\r\n\nthis record.\r\n\n          In insisting  that the  acts and practices  said to\r\n\nconstitute  a   violation   did  not   occur  primarily   and\r\n\nsubstantially within the  commonwealth, the defendants assert\r\n\nas follows:   The  Placing Information  was prepared by  G.L.\r\n\n                             -88-\r\r\n\nHodson in  New York.   It was  then transmitted  to the  sub-\r\n\nbrokers in  London, and communicated by  the sub-brokers from\r\n\nLondon  to the  plaintiffs  at their  places  of business  in\r\n\nLondon and continental Europe.  The plaintiffs, to the extent\r\n\nthey  relied on  any  misrepresentations, did  so in  Europe,\r\n\nsigned the slips and Treaty Wordings in Europe,  and suffered\r\n\nany  financial  injury in  Europe.    As  the  judge  himself\r\n\nindicated, \"notwithstanding that there were activities within\r\n\nthis  state,  at  least  and  maybe  the  most  crucial  were\r\n\noverseas.\"  The latter  reason caused the court to  refuse to\r\n\naward double or treble  damages, a discretionary matter under\r\n\n   11.  Defendants argue that  this shows a misreading of the\r\n\nstatute, because if the district court found that the crucial\r\n\nactions creating liability had  occurred overseas, they could\r\n\nnot   have   occurred    primarily   and   substantially   in\r\n\nMassachusetts, hence he should have found no liability at all\r\n\nunder  ch.  93A.     Defendants  insist  that  if  misleading\r\n\nstatements  are made  in Massachusetts  but are  received and\r\n\nrelied  upon  outside  the  commonwealth,  there  can  be  no\r\n\nliability under ch. 93A.\r\n\n          The  plaintiffs  reply   that  the  district  court\r\n\nimplicitly  found that  the defendants  failed to  meet their\r\n\nstatutory burden of proving that their fraudulent conduct did\r\n\nnot occur  primarily and substantially  in the  commonwealth.\r\n\nPlaintiffs  disagree that  the only  relevant conduct  is the\r\n\n                             -89-\r\r\n\nplacing of the Treaties overseas, and argue that the relevant\r\n\nconduct includes (1) the location of the defendants and their\r\n\nbusiness, (2) the initial drafting of the placing information\r\n\nin Boston, prior to its communication to G.L. Hodson, (3) the\r\n\nfact  that  all  subsequent false  and  deceptive information\r\n\nemanated  from Boston,  (4)  certain  later meetings  between\r\n\nvarious plaintiffs and defendants, and between defendants and\r\n\ntheir brokers, in Boston, (5) the place of performance of the\r\n\ncontracts (Boston), (6) the  day-to-day operation of the SANS\r\n\nprogram in Boston, (7) the alleged obstruction of plaintiffs'\r\n\nattempts  to inspect NERCO's books and records in Boston, and\r\n\n(8) the reaping of the benefits of the fraud in Boston.  They\r\n\nargue that Massachusetts case law does not provide a  bright-\r\n\nline test for the \"primarily and substantially\" standard, but\r\n\nrather requires a \"pragmatic, functional analysis\" which must\r\n\ninclude  consideration not only  of where the communications,\r\n\nreliance, and injury took  place, but also where the  bulk of\r\n\nthe more mundane activities did not occurr.\r\n\n          A  finding   whether  the  defendant  has  met  its\r\n\nstatutory  burden   of  proving   that  its   activities  and\r\n\ntransactions   occurred   primarily   and  substantially   in\r\n\nMassachusetts is a matter of law, subject to plenary  review.\r\n\nClinton Hosp.

The plaintiff, Bushkin, a\r\n\nNew  York  resident, based  his  ch.  93A claim  on  \"alleged\r\n\nrepresentations made during a telephone call or calls in 1975\r\n\nbetween a  Raytheon officer  in Massachusetts and  Bushkin in\r\n\nNew  York.\"  Id. at 638,  473 N.E.2d at 672.   As a result of\r                            \r\n\ninformation Bushkin  disclosed  to Raytheon  over the  phone,\r\n\nRaytheon  learned  that  Beech  Aircraft  Corporation  was  a\r\n\npossible acquisition target.   Bushkin alleged  that Raytheon\r\n\nhad  promised to  pay  him a  fee  if it  were successful  in\r\n\nacquiring Beech.   After telling  him that it  was no  longer\r\n\ninterested in  Beech, Raytheon  acquired it  with the  aid of\r\n\nanother consultant, and denied Bushkin any compensation.  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nat 624-26, 473 N.E.2d at 664-65.\r\n\n          In finding against Bushkin,  the SJC noted that the\r\n\ntelephone calls  were between  the two states,  the allegedly\r\n\ndeceptive statements  were made in Massachusetts but received\r\n\nand acted on in New  York, and that any loss was  incurred in\r\n\nNew York.  Id.  Based on Bushkin, this court in Clinton Hosp.\r                                                                         \r\n\nminimized the location of the dissembler at the time he makes\r\n\na  deceptive statement  for  purposes of  the \"primarily  and\r\n\nsubstantially\" analysis.   \"Rather,\" we  said, \"the  critical\r\n\nfactor is the locus of the  recipient of the deception at the\r\n\n                             -91-\r\r\n\ntime of the reliance.\"   Clinton Hosp., 907 F.2d  at 1265-66.\r                                                  \r\n\nWe likewise gave weight to the situs of the loss.  Id.\r                                                                  \r\n\n          Viewing  the  conduct  surrounding  the  fraudulent\r\n\nmisrepresentations in the  Placing Information points  to the\r\n\nsame result  as that  reached in Bushkin.   As in  that case,\r                                                    \r\n\nnon-Massachusetts  residents are  here attempting  to recover\r\n\nfor the allegedly  unfair trade practices of a corporation in\r\n\nMassachusetts, under a  statute designed  to protect  against\r\n\nin-state frauds.  As in that case, the defendant's day-to-day\r\n\nbusiness activities were largely carried on in Massachusetts.\r\n\nAs in that case, we shall assume that the allegedly deceptive\r\n\nacts or  practices    in particular,  the Placing Information\r\n\n   originated  in Massachusetts, but the  Placing Information\r\n\nwas  intended   to  be,  and  was,   circulated  abroad,  and\r\n\nplaintiffs  received and acted upon  it there.   The situs of\r\n\nthe plaintiffs' losses was  also in Europe.  It  follows that\r\n\nwith  respect   to  plaintiffs'   claims  of  fraud   in  the\r\n\ninducement,  the defendants  have met their  statutory burden\r\n\nunder   11 of  proving that their fraudulent conduct  did not\r\n\noccur primarily and substantially  in Massachusetts.  On this\r\n\npoint, we reverse the district court's ruling that defendants\r\n\nare liable under Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93A,   2.\r\n\n          This does  not, however, end  the matter.   In this\r\n\nopinion, we have sustained the district court's finding  of a\r\n\nbreach of contract stemming from defendants' violation of its\r\n\n                             -92-\r\r\n\ncontractual obligation  to retain 10% of  all system business\r\n\nceded to  the SANS  Treaties.   We have also  left open,  for\r\n\nfurther  consideration  on  remand,  a  contract  claim   for\r\n\npossible failure to perform underwriting as promised.  And we\r\n\nhave  left open the possibility,  on remand, of  a finding of\r\n\nfraudulent concealment  of the  use of intermediaries  and of\r\n\nother conduct  deviating from representations in  the Placing\r\n\nInformation,  in  the years  following the  initial Treaties.\r\n\nThe  above activities,  or  some of  them, might  conceivably\r\n\nsupport --  although we take  no position at  this time --  a\r\n\nfinding   of      2   violations   occurring  primarily   and\r\n\nsubstantially  within Massachusetts.   Accordingly,  while we\r\n\nhold that fraud in  the inducement based upon representations\r\n\nin  the  Placing  Information  did not  occur  primarily  and\r\n\nsubstantially within  Massachusetts, we  do not at  this time\r\n\nforeclose  liability under  Mass. Gen.  L. ch.  93A  based on\r\n\ndifferent conduct of the type mentioned above.  We leave such\r\n\ndetermination to the district court on remand.\r\n\nVII.      The RICO Claims\r                      The RICO Claims\r\n\n          In  the  same  footnote   in  which  it  found  the\r\n\ndefendants liable under ch. 93A, the district court found for\r\n\nthe  defendants  under the  Racketeer Influenced  and Corrupt\r\n\nOrganizations  Act (\"RICO\"), 18  U.S.C.    1961-1968, stating\r\n\nthat,\r\n\n          Title  18,  United States  Code, Sections\r\n          1961-1968 do not  apply to  the facts  of\r\n\n                             -93-\r\r\n\n          this   case  on   the  ground   that  the\r\n          Plaintiffs have failed to  establish that\r\n          they  suffered   an  \"investment\"  injury\r\n          under Section 1962(a) or an \"acquisition\"\r\n          injury under Section  1962(b) or that the\r\n          three Defendants were separate persons as\r\n          required under Section 1962(c).\r\n\n825 F. Supp.  at 383 n.9.34   In No. 93-2338,  the plaintiffs\r\n\nappeal from this ruling, arguing that the district  court was\r\n\nwrong with respect to all three sections of RICO.\r\n\n          In order  to  recover in  a  civil RICO  action,  a\r\n\nplaintiff must  prove both that the defendant violated one of\r\n\nthe provisions of 18 U.S.C.   1962 and that the plaintiff was\r\n\ninjured  \"in  his business  or  property  by  reason of\"  the\r\n\ndefendant's  violation.   18  U.S.C.     1964(c).   Thus,  in\r\n\nproving a right to recover for a RICO violation premised upon\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n34.  No judgment  dismissing the  RICO claims was  entered by\r\nthe  district court; the only disposition  of those claims is\r\nthe above-quoted language in the  district court's Memorandum\r\nand Order of June  7, 1993.  See Fed.  R. Civ. P. 58  (\"Every\r                                            \r\njudgment  shall be  set  forth on  a  separate document.    A\r\njudgment is effective only when so set forth and when entered\r\nas provided in Rule 79(a).\").  We proceed, however, as though\r\nthe judgment  for the plaintiffs issued on September 21, 1993\r\npursuant  to  that  order  had  included  language  expressly\r\ndismissing the RICO claims.

Again,  even assuming that plaintiffs\r\n\nproved the  underlying RICO  violation, they failed  to prove\r\n\nany  harm   beyond  that  resulting  from   the  fraud  which\r\n\nconstituted  the  predicate act.    See,  e.g., Danielsen  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nBurnside-Ott Aviation  Training Ctr.,  Inc.,  941 F.2d  1220,\r                                                       \r\n\n                             -95-\r\r\n\n1231   (D.C.

The  plaintiffs claimed that  they\r\n\nwere harmed by their participation  in the SANS treaties, not\r\n\nby the defendants' acquisition or control of Graham Watson.\r\n\n          As  to  the    1962(c)  claim,  the district  court\r\n\nstated  that  \"the  three  Defendants   were  [not]  separate\r\n\npersons.\"   In fact, however, NERCO, First State, and Cameron\r\n\n&amp; Colby were distinct corporate entities, with separate legal\r\n\nidentities.  The distinction  between those three entities is\r\n\nnot, however, decisive  for   1962(c) purposes.   The statute\r\n\nrequires that the person (i.e., the three defendants) engaged\r                                    \r\n\nin  racketeering be  distinct  from the  enterprise (in  this\r                                                               \r\n\ncase, Graham Watson, not a defendant) whose activities  he or\r\n\nshe  seeks  to  conduct  through racketeering.    See,  e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nMiranda v. Ponce Federal  Bank, 948 F.2d 41, 44-45  (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1991) (citing  cases) (\"the same entity cannot do double duty\r\n\nas  both  the  RICO  defendant  and  the  RICO  enterprise\").\r\n\nAssuming the court meant to find that NERCO, First State, and\r\n\nCameron  &amp; Colby were not distinct from Graham Watson, it was\r\n\nclearly entitled,  on the evidence presented, to  make such a\r\n\nfinding.   Up  until mid-1980,  Graham Watson  was merely  an\r\n\nunincorporated division of Cameron &amp; Colby.  After that time,\r\n\nalthough  it  became   a  separate  wholly-owned   subsidiary\r\n\n                             -96-\r\r\n\ncorporation,  all  of its  employees were  in fact  Cameron &amp;\r\n\nColby  employees, and  there is  no evidence  whatsoever that\r\n\nGraham  Watson took  any actions  independent of  its parent.\r\n\nCf.  Brittingham v.  Mobil Corp., 943  F.2d 297,  302-303 (3d\r                                            \r\n\nCir. 1991)  (noting that    1962(c)  claims may  be dismissed\r\n\n\"when  the   enterprise  and  defendant,   although  facially\r\n\ndistinct,  are in reality no different from each other\").  We\r\n\naccordingly  affirm  the district  court's  dismissal  of the\r\n\nplaintiffs' RICO claims.\r\n\nVIII.     Damages\r                      Damages\r\n\n          The   district   court   ruled   that   \"[i]n   the\r\n\ncircumstances of this case, it  is not feasible to reasonably\r\n\ncalculate  damages  on  the  basis  of  the  'benefit  of the\r\n\nbargain' method  of damages.\"   The court  accordingly (after\r\n\nfurther  proceedings)  entered  judgment  in  the  amount  of\r\n\n$38,118,940.07  (which  sum  included prejudgment  interest),\r\n\nplus  postjudgment   interest  and  costs.     This  sum  was\r\n\ncalculated to  be the difference  between claims paid  by the\r\n\nplaintiff reinsurers less the  premiums they received  during\r\n\nthe course of  the SANS  Treaties.  The  district court  also\r\n\nannounced  in its Memorandum and  Order of June  7, 1993 (but\r\n\nnot  in any  separate judgment),  that \"the  only appropriate\r\n\nremedy  is  to  rescind the  SANS  Treaties  as  a matter  of\r\n\nequity.\"\r\n\n          Defendants  complain  on  appeal   that  plaintiffs\r\n\n                             -97-\r\r\n\nshould have been required  to prove, and could  only recover,\r\n\n\"benefit  of the  bargain\"  damages.   Defendants argue  that\r\n\nplaintiffs  in  fact suffered  no  damage  at all  as  \"[t]he\r\n\nresults achieved under the SANS Treaties were poor, but  they\r\n\nwere   better   than   industry   average   results   . . . .\r\n\nPlaintiffs'  experts,  who  utilized  individual  certificate\r\n\nfacultative  underwriting,  reluctantly  admitted  their  own\r\n\noperations lost money and were closed down.\"   In defendants'\r\n\nview,  the  losses  under  the  SANS  Treaties  were  due  to\r\n\n\"extremely  adverse market  conditions     low  premiums  and\r\n\nunprecedented loss experiences.\"   As the judge commented, it\r\n\nwas \"a disastrous  market.\"   Defendants go on  to point  out\r\n\nthat \"[t]here was no evidence that brokerage-located business\r\n\nresulted in larger losses than business obtained 'directly.'\"\r\n\n          The court, in  its opinion  excused the  plaintiffs\r\n\nfrom establishing  damages  because, for  plaintiffs to  have\r\n\ndone so,\r\n\n          it  would have  been necessary  to obtain\r\n          the financial records of the major direct\r\n          reinsurance     companies     . . . which\r\n          financial  records  are confidential  and\r\n          not accessible to third parties.\r\n\n          We find no  legal error in the  court's decision to\r\n\nfurnish  relief  for fraud  based  on  cancelling plaintiffs'\r\n\nreinsurance obligations under the  Treaties.  When an insurer\r\n\nestablishes that it was induced by fraud to issue policies of\r\n\ninsurance, cancellation of  the policy is a customary form of\r\n\n                             -98-\r\r\n\nrelief.   See, e.g., Century Indem., 333 Mass. at 504-05, 131\r                                               \r\n\nN.E.2d  at 769.   To  the extent  that these  plaintiffs were\r\n\nceded shares in reinsurance  under Treaties they were induced\r\n\nto  join,  and  continued   to  participate  in,  because  of\r\n\ndefendants' fraud, the district  court was authorized,  where\r\n\notherwise appropriate, to provide the remedy of retroactively\r\n\ncancelling  the  applicable Treaties,  reimbursing plaintiffs\r\n\nfor  their   net  losses,  and  absolving   them  from  their\r\n\nunfulfilled reinsurance obligations thereunder.\r\n\n          In this opinion we  have reversed the fraud finding\r\n\nbased on the  \"facultative\" representations, but  have upheld\r\n\nit  in respect  to reliance  on representations  in the  1979\r\n\nPlacing  Information  regarding  securing nontreaty  business\r\n\n\"directly\"  rather  than  through  intermediaries.    Thus  a\r\n\ncancellation remedy for fraud may still be appropriate  as to\r\n\nreinsurance  retroceded to plaintiffs  which was  infected by\r\n\nthat  fraud.     However,   we  have  remanded   for  further\r\n\nconsideration  of   whether  the  statutes   of  limitations,\r\n\nincluding that for fraud,  constitute a bar to the  claims of\r\n\nany   or  all  plaintiffs.     We  have   also  remanded  for\r\n\nconsideration whether,  at least in some  cases, the original\r\n\nfraud was dissipated, or its duration limited to a particular\r\n\nyear or years, by the receipt of knowledge of  the falsity of\r\n\nthe  earlier  representations  coupled  with  renewal  of the\r\n\nTreaty  or other  conduct indicating acquiescence  or waiver.\r\n\n                             -99-\r\r\n\nWe have further remanded for consideration of whether certain\r\n\nof the plaintiffs are barred from relief for fraud because of\r\n\ntheir failure to establish reliance.\r\n\n          We accordingly  vacate all  relief  granted by  the\r\n\ncourt and remand for further findings on what relief, if any,\r\n\nis appropriate in light  of the other findings that  are made\r\n\nupon remand.    If  there are  instances  where  recovery  is\r\n\nappropriate for  breach of contract only,  rather than fraud,\r\n\nthe court should determine the proper measure of relief, and,\r\n\nsubject  to  our rulings  herein,  the  district court  shall\r\n\nrecalculate the proper award, if any  is due, on the basis of\r\n\nits assessment of the law and facts.\r\n\nIX.       Prejudgment Interest\r                      Prejudgment Interest\r\n\n          The  defendants  argue  that  the  district court's\r\n\norder  rescinding  the  SANS  Treaties was  a  restitutionary\r\n\naward, not an  award of damages.  Thus, they say, the court's\r\n\nassessment of prejudgment interest at the rate  of 12 percent\r\n\nset  by  Mass.  Gen. L.  ch.  231,      6B,  6C, and  6H  was\r\n\nerroneous, because the rate of interest set by those statutes\r\n\nis applicable only to awards of damages, not to rescissionary\r\n\nawards.   They  argue  that the  plaintiffs  made an  express\r\n\nelection  of remedies,  choosing rescission  and restitution,\r\n\nand  thus foregoing  their  option to  pursue  the remedy  of\r\n\ncontract  damages  and  interest   on  those  damages.    The\r\n\ndefendants contend that prejudgment interest should have been\r\n\n                            -100-\r\r\n\napplied at the  rate of 6  percent set by  Mass. Gen. L.  ch.\r\n\n107,   3.\r\n\n          In light of the fact that we are vacating the award\r\n\nand remanding  this case  to  the district  court, where  any\r\n\njudgment eventually  awarded to either party  may bear little\r\n\nresemblance  to the judgment we vacate  today, we decline the\r\n\ndefendants' invitation to  consider this point at length.  We\r\n\nfind  it  of  interest, however,  that     6C  has been  held\r\n\napplicable to a recovery based on an action for money paid by\r\n\nmistake, Commercial Union, 412 Mass. at 555-56, 591 N.E.2d at\r                                     \r\n\n171-72, a recovery which  seemingly bears more resemblance to\r\n\nrestitution than to money damages.\r\n\nX.        Conclusion\r                      Conclusion\r\n\n          Appeal No. 93-2339\r                                        \r\n\n          We  sustain  the   district  court's  findings  and\r\n\nrulings on  certain matters;  reverse others either  as being\r\n\nclearly erroneous  or legally incorrect;  and identify  still\r\n\nothers that require the  district court to make findings  and\r\n\nrulings now absent.    We, therefore, vacate in  its entirety\r\n\nthe  judgment  awarding  a  total of  $38,118,940.07  to  the\r\n\nplaintiffs and remand with directions that the district court\r\n\nhold further proceedings and take such further actions as are\r\n\nnecessary to  comply with this  opinion.35  We  summarize our\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n35.  As  a  matter of  consistency,  we  likewise vacate  the\r\ncourt's  other directives  not  incorporated in  its judgment\r\npurporting to afford relief, such as its equitable rescission\r\n\n                            -101-\r\r\n\nspecific dispositions as follows:\r\n\n          (1)  We  reverse  as  being  clearly erroneous  the\r\n\ndistrict court's  finding of fraud  premised upon defendants'\r\n\npromise to cede \"facultative\" reinsurance.\r\n\n          (2)  We   sustain  the  court's  finding  that  the\r\n\ndefendants made misrepresentations in the Placing Information\r\n\nto the effect,  inter alia, that  they would obtain  business\r                                      \r\n\ndirectly from primary insurers.  However, the  claim of fraud\r\n\nbased on  this finding must be given further consideration on\r\n\nremand  in   light  of   our  direction  to   reconsider  the\r\n\ndefendants' defense  based on the statute  of limitations; to\r\n\nrevisit  the  reliance  element  and  deny  recovery  to  any\r\n\nplaintiff  unable  to satisfy  its  burden of  proof  on this\r\n\npoint; and to  reconsider the possible effects  of any notice\r\n\nand knowledge  obtained by any  of the plaintiffs  during the\r\n\nlives of the SANS Treaties and determine whether these defeat\r\n\nor limit the duration of any plaintiffs' continuing rights of\r\n\nrecovery in fraud.\r\n\n          (3)  We  reverse  the district  court's  finding of\r\n\nbreach of  contract based  upon the  supposed non-facultative\r\n\ncharacter of the retroceded reinsurance.  We also reverse the\r\n\ndistrict  court's finding  of breach  of contract  based upon\r\n\nfailure to \"produce\" the  retroceded reinsurance.  We reverse\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nof the SANS  Treaties.   Such orders should  be revisited  on\r\nremand and reissued, modified, or not as the court determines\r\nin light of this opinion and its own findings and rulings.\r\n\n                            -102-\r\r\n\nthe district court's breach of contract  finding based on the\r\n\npromise that Graham Watson would \"underwrite\"  the retroceded\r\n\nreinsurance, except we leave open  for the court to consider,\r\n\non  remand,  whether  the  underwriting might  have  been  so\r\n\nentirely inadequate as to violate  that provision.  We affirm\r\n\nthe district court's finding of breach of contract based upon\r\n\nthe  violation of  Warranty No.  2 in  the slips,  subject to\r\n\nfurther findings on the effect of the  statute of limitations\r\n\nand any other bar to recovery.\r\n\n          (4)  We  direct  the  court to  consider  and  make\r\n\nspecific  findings   and  rulings  as  to   the  statutes  of\r\n\nlimitations defenses and to  find the dates that each  of the\r\n\nrelevant statutes began to run as to each of the plaintiffs.\r\n\n          (5) We  direct the court to  recalculate the proper\r\n\namount  of relief and prejudgment interest  to the extent its\r\n\nother  determinations  on  remand  are  consistent  with  the\r\n\nawarding of relief to any of the plaintiffs.  We have upheld,\r\n\nas a  remedy, the cancellation of any reinsurance infected by\r\n\nfraudulent representations  and leave to the  court on remand\r\n\nthe  determination of any  other theories of  relief that may\r\n\nbecome appropriate.\r\n\n          (6) We reverse the court's allowance of plaintiffs'\r\n\nclaims under Mass. Gen. L.  ch. 93A,   2 insofar as  they are\r\n\nbased on fraud in the inducement.  However, we remand for the\r\n\ndistrict  court's further  consideration  whether  any  other\r\n\n                            -103-\r\r\n\nconduct,  as  mentioned  in  this opinion,  might  support  a\r\n\nfinding of liability under that statute.\r\n\n          Appeal No. 93-2338\r                                        \r\n\n          We  affirm  the   district  court's  dismissal   of\r\n\nplaintiffs' claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\r\n\nOrganizations Act, 18 U.S.C.    1961-1968.\r\n\n          So ordered.

At  issue are reinsurance contracts (or\r\n\n\"treaties,\"  as  they  are  known)  under  which  plaintiffs,\r\n\nCompagnie De Reassurance  D'Ile de France, et al.,1 agreed to\r\n\nreinsure portions  of risks selected, and  also reinsured, by\r\n\ndefendant New  England  Reinsurance Corp.  (\"NERCO\").   After\r\n\nsustaining heavy losses under these Treaties, plaintiffs sued\r\n\ndefendants  NERCO,  First  State  Insurance  Company  (\"First\r\n\nState\"), and Cameron and Colby Co., Inc. (\"Cameron &amp; Colby\"),\r\n\nalleging  that  they  had  been  induced  to  enter  into the\r\n\nreinsurance treaties by fraud, and further claiming breach of\r\n\ncontract,  violations  of Mass.  Gen. L.  ch.  93A,    2, and\r\n\nviolations   of  the   Racketeer   Influenced   and   Corrupt\r\n\nOrganizations  Act   (\"RICO\"),   18  U.S.C.        1961-1968.\r\n\nDefendants  counterclaimed, alleging  breach of  contract and\r\n\nviolations of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93A,   2.  Following a 30-day\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  plaintiffs  are  listed  in  the   district  court's\r\nopinion.  See Compagnie de Reassurance D'Ile de France v. New\r                                                                         \r\nEngland  Reinsurance Corp.,  825 F.  Supp. 370,  373 n.2  (D.\r                                      \r\nMass. 1993).   Plaintiffs Pohjola Insurance  Company Ltd. and\r\nPohjola  Insurance  Company (UK)  Limited  were dismissed  on\r\nmotion of  the defendants, with the consent of the plaintiffs\r\nduring the  trial, and the  parties entered a  Stipulation of\r\nDismissal dated  May 5,  1995, whereby plaintiff  De Centrale\r\nHerzverzekering N.V. dismissed its appeal in No. 93-2338, and\r\nthe defendants dismissed their  appeal in No. 93-2339 against\r\nDe Centrale only, leaving 31 plaintiffs remaining.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nbench trial, the district  court found for the  plaintiffs on\r\n\nall but the RICO claims.  The court ordered rescission of the\r\n\nchallenged reinsurance Treaties and ordered defendants to pay\r\n\nplaintiffs $38,118,940.07, representing  all sums  plaintiffs\r\n\nhad previously paid out on losses incurred under the Treaties\r\n\nwith credit for premiums  received, plus prejudgment interest\r\n\nat 12 percent.  Defendants estimate that the net cost to them\r\n\nof the court's decision, adding together the court's judgment\r\n\nand  the sums plaintiffs have been excused from paying out as\r\n\nreinsurers of various losses, is approximately $106 million.\r\n\n          Defendants have  appealed  from the  judgments  for\r\n\nplaintiffs on the fraud,  contract and Mass. Gen. L.  ch. 93A\r\n\nclaims.   Plaintiffs  have cross-appealed  from the  district\r\n\ncourt's dismissal of their  RICO claim.  For the  reasons set\r\n\nforth  below, we  sustain the  district court's  findings and\r\n\nrulings on  certain matters; reverse others  as being clearly\r\n\nerroneous  or legally  incorrect;  and identify  still others\r\n\nthat require  the district court to make findings and rulings\r\n\nnow  absent.   We,  therefore,  vacate  the district  court's\r\n\njudgments  and  remand  for  further  proceedings  consistent\r\n\nherewith.  Our specific  dispositions are summarized on pages\r\n\n98-100 of this opinion.\r\n\nI.        Background\r                      Background\r\n\n          The following is an  overview.  More specific facts\r\n\nwill  be related as needed  in our discussion  of the various\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nissues.\r\n\n          The defendants are all subsidiaries of the Hartford\r\n\nGroup  of  Insurance  Companies  (\"the  Hartford\").2    First\r\n\nState, based in Boston, Massachusetts, was a primary insurer.\r\n\nNERCO was  a Boston-based reinsurer.   Cameron &amp;  Colby, also\r\n\nbased    in    Boston,   provided    management,   marketing,\r\n\nunderwriting,  and other  services  to both  First State  and\r\n\nNERCO.   Neither First State  nor NERCO had  employees of its\r\n\nown; their businesses were carried on by employees of Cameron\r\n\n&amp; Colby.  Graham  Watson, Inc.,3 not a party,  was created in\r\n\n1979 as  an unincorporated  division of Cameron  &amp; Colby;  it\r\n\nbecame  the  latter's  wholly owned  subsidiary  in mid-1980.\r\n\nGraham   Watson's  role   was   to   provide  marketing   and\r\n\nunderwriting   services   in  the   facultative4  reinsurance\r\n\nventure that is the subject of this litigation.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The  relationship  between  these  defendants  and  their\r\ncorporate parents, the Hartford and  ITT, is described in the\r\ndistrict court's </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">opinion,</span> <span class=\"volume\">825</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">373</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.   Neither the\r\nHartford nor ITT is a party to this case.\r\n\n3.  This entity is  variously referred to  as \"Graham-Watson\"\r\nand \"Graham Watson\" in the documents contained in the record.\r\nLike  the district court, we will  use the unhyphenated form,\r\nunless quoting directly a source using the hyphenated form. \r\n\n4.  Facultative reinsurance is one of  the two major types of\r\nreinsurance, the  other being  treaty reinsurance.   From the\r\nLatin word for  \"ability\" or \"power,\"  \"facultative,\" broadly\r\nspeaking,  connotes  the option  to  reinsure,  or not,  each\r\nparticular risk, as contrasted  with a binding arrangement to\r\nreinsure all risks of a particular sort.  See infra.  A major\r                                                               \r\nissue in  this case is  whether the  reinsurance provided  by\r\ndefendants  was  \"facultative,\"  as  promised  in  the   SANS\r\nTreaties.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n          The  underlying casualty and property risks germane\r\n\nto  this case were located in North America.  Individuals and\r\n\nentities  wishing  to  insure  against  these  risks procured\r\n\npolicies of insurance from primary insurers.  The latter then\r\n\npurchased  reinsurance  from  NERCO  in  order  to  indemnify\r\n\nthemselves in whole or in part against losses sustained under\r\n\nthe primary policies they had issued.\r\n\n          Not  wanting to keep  all the exposure  that it had\r\n\nassumed as a reinsurer, NERCO itself    often acting with and\r\n\nthrough  Graham Watson     sought  reinsurance on  the London\r\n\ninsurance  market, resulting  in the arrangements  with which\r\n\nthis lawsuit is concerned.  Under these reinsuring agreements\r\n\n-- the  so-called System and Non-System  (\"SANS\") Treaties --\r\n\nmany  syndicates  at Lloyd's  of  London  and other  overseas\r\n\nreinsurance entities (some of whom are the plaintiffs in this\r\n\ncase) agreed to  provide continuing reinsurance to NERCO on a\r\n\nportion of each risk it reinsured.   In industry terminology,\r\n\nNERCO, having been \"ceded\" the risks by the primary insurers,\r\n\nbecame    a    \"retrocedent,\"    the     plaintiffs    became\r\n\n\"retrocessionaires,\" and  the  agreements between  them  were\r\n\n\"retrocessional\" treaties.   The plaintiff  retrocessionaires\r\n\nagreed to indemnify NERCO  for a portion of any  losses NERCO\r\n\nmight sustain  in its  reinsurance of  primary insurers.   In\r\n\nreturn,  NERCO  promised  to  acquire  (\"produce\"),  evaluate\r\n\n(\"underwrite\"),  and price  (\"rate\") the  risks and  to share\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nwith plaintiff retrocessionaires, subject to its retention of\r\n\ncertain commissions, a portion of the premium it received.\r\n\n          A.  Signing the Treaties\r                          Signing the Treaties\r\n\n          In 1979, NERCO retained a U.S. broker, G.L. Hodson,\r\n\nto  assist it in arranging for this reinsurance on the London\r\n\nmarket.   Towards this end, Graves Hewitt, the CEO of Cameron\r\n\n&amp; Colby, and  his associates drafted  and circulated in  late\r\n\n1979 a  document  known as  the  Placing Information.    This\r\n\ndocument  stated that  Cameron  &amp; Colby  had established  the\r\n\nGraham Watson division after studying facultative reinsurance\r\n\noperations in North America  and after receiving the approval\r\n\nand support of the Hartford and ITT.5  The  stated purpose of\r\n\nthe division was:\r\n\n          1.   To participate in  the property  and\r\n               casualty   facultative   reinsurance\r\n               business    which    is    currently\r\n               dominated by the direct writers.\r\n\n          2.   To rationalise [sic] the facultative\r\n               placements of both the  Hartford and\r\n               the  First  State not  only  from an\r\n               administration  [sic] point  of view\r\n               but    also     to    provide    the\r\n               retrocessionaires with a broad cross\r\n               section  of facultative  reinsurance\r\n               emanating from these two companies.\r\n\nAccording  to  the  Placing Information,  Graham  Watson  was\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Plaintiffs'   fraud   claims   rely    significantly   on\r\nrepresentations made  in the Placing  Information, especially\r\nthose pertaining to Graham Watson's intention to procure non-\r\nbrokered, \"direct\" business from \"selected primary companies\"\r\nrather than brokers.  We attach  as an appendix a copy of the\r\nPlacing Information typically circulated to the plaintiffs.\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\ncharged  with  penetrating the  \"non-brokered  .  . .  direct\r\n\nprofessional  reinsurance   market,\"  leaving  \"[f]acultative\r\n\nreinsurance emanating  from reinsurance intermediaries  . . .\r\n\n[to] continue  to be written separately  through NERFAC,\" the\r\n\nlatter being an  existing in-house entity that  had, for some\r\n\ntime,  been  writing reinsurance  for  the  defendants.   The\r\n\nPlacing Information was circulated  to, among others, several\r\n\nEuropean  sub-brokers retained  by Hodson  to act  on NERCO's\r\n\nbehalf in seeking potential retrocessionaires.6\r\n\n          In late 1979, Hewitt traveled to London accompanied\r\n\nby  Thomas Hearn, a Hodson  employee.  Aided  by employees of\r\n\nsub-broker Sedgwick  Payne, they approached Ralph Bailey, the\r\n\nhead underwriter  for plaintiff Terra Nova  Insurance Company\r\n\nLimited, and described to  him the proposed reinsurance plan.\r\n\nSedgwick-Payne's  brokers  thereafter negotiated  with Bailey\r\n\nthe \"slips\" spelling  out the  terms of the  treaties.   With\r\n\nBailey agreeing to act as  \"lead underwriter\" for the  London\r\n\nmarket companies,  the brokers  approached  Ron Kellet,  head\r\n\nunderwriter for  plaintiff B.P.D. Kellet &amp;  Others, a Lloyd's\r\n\nsyndicate, with the  request that he act as  lead underwriter\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  These included Sedgwick Payne, North American Reinsurance\r\nBrokers Ltd.; Anglo-Swiss  Reinsurance Brokers, Ltd.;  Carter\r\nBrito E Cunha Ltd.; Fielding &amp; Partners; and Jardine Thompson\r\nGraham  Ltd.   None of  the sub-brokers  are parties  to this\r\nsuit.\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\non  behalf of all other Lloyd's syndicates.7  After the leads\r\n\nhad   stamped  and  initialed   the  slips,   indicating  the\r\n\nproportion of the total  risk they were bound to  accept, the\r\n\nslips   were  separately   presented  for  approval   to  the\r\n\nunderwriters  for  each  of  the plaintiffs,8  each  of  whom\r\n\nindicated his or her acceptance of a  portion of the risks by\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  A  lead   underwriter   is  initially   responsible   for\r\nnegotiating the  terms of  reinsurance contracts such  as the\r\nSANS Treaties.  The lead underwriter normally commits  his or\r\nher firm or syndicate to a level of participation in a treaty\r\nthat  is somewhat  higher  than that  of other  participating\r\nreinsurers, who  are referred  to as the  \"following market.\"\r\nMembers  of the  following  market rely  on the  underwriting\r\nskill  and judgment of the  lead as an  important factor when\r\ndeciding whether  and by  how much  to  commit themselves  on\r\nreinsurance   obligations.      Thus,   having   a  reputable\r\nunderwriter  as  lead can  have a  significant effect  on the\r\nability  to fully place a retrocessional  treaty.  There were\r\nactually  two lead underwriters in this case:  Bailey for the\r\nLondon  market   companies  and   Kellett  for  the   Lloyd's\r\nsyndicates.   See Edinburgh Assur.  Co. v. R.L.

Not all  of the 31  plaintiffs participated  in all  four\r\nyears  of  the   SANS  Treaties.    (28  of   the  plaintiffs\r\nparticipated in  the 1980  SANS Treaties; 29  participated in\r\n1981; 27 participated in 1982;  and 15 participated in 1983.)\r\nHowever, the process of stamping and initialling the slips to\r\nindicate  acceptance of a portion of the risk was repeated in\r\neach of the following  three years (1981-83) with respect  to\r\neach individual plaintiff.  We  also note that the plaintiffs\r\nwere not the only retrocessionaires participating in the SANS\r\nTreaties;  in   all,  approximately  100   separate  entities\r\naccepted portions  of  these risks  over  the four  years  in\r\nquestion.\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\ninitialing the slip.9\r\n\n          These  slips constituted, in  abbreviated form, the\r\n\ncontracts   between  the   cedent   NERCO  and   the  various\r\n\nretrocessionaires.10      Briefly   summarized,   the   slips\r\n\nprovided  that  the  subject   matter  of  the  Treaties  was\r\n\n\"Business classified by the Reassured [NERCO] as Property and\r\n\nCasualty   Facultative   Assumed   business    produced   and\r\n\nunderwritten by the Graham Watson division of Cameron &amp; Colby\r\n\nCo.,  Inc.\"  They also  stated that the  Lead Underwriter had\r\n\nauthority to require exclusion of certain types of risks, and\r\n\nto agree to the final wording  of the formal contract.  NERCO\r\n\nwas  to retain a minimum of  $250,000 of each risk ceded, and\r\n\nas  respects system  business (i.e.,  risks written  by First\r\n\nState and  other Hartford entities,  infra), was not  to cede\r                                                      \r\n\nmore than 50 percent of the original reinsurance limit of any\r\n\ngiven risk to  the Treaties,  and was to  co-reinsure for  10\r\n\npercent participation  on  each such  risk.   The slips  also\r\n\nspecified   the  commission   structure  and   various  other\r\n\nconditions of the  Treaties.  The  slips did not  incorporate\r\n\nthe Placing Information as such.\r\n\n          Each   underwriter   subsequently   signed   Treaty\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  For a  detailed discussion  of the business  practices of\r\nthe  London insurance  market, see  Edinburgh Assur.,  479 F.\r                                                                \r\nSupp. at 144-46. \r\n\n10.  We  place in the appendix portions of one of the typical\r\nslips utilized here.\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\nWordings,   formal  contracts  containing  a  more  elaborate\r\n\nstatement  of the parties'  agreements.  These  were based on\r\n\nthe slips, and  the parties agreed that, in the  event of any\r\n\ninconsistency,  the slips  would control.   The first  set of\r\n\nSANS Treaties ran for the eleven month period from February 1\r\n\nthrough December 31, 1980.   Thereafter, those plaintiffs who\r\n\ndesired  to   continue  for  another  year   indicated  their\r\n\nwillingness to  join by initialling new  slips and ultimately\r\n\nexecuting new Treaty Wordings  for 1981.  Successive Treaties\r\n\nwere entered  into  for  1982 and  for  1983.   Some  of  the\r\n\nplaintiffs  entered into Treaties for each of the four years;\r\n\nothers were parties  to the  Treaties for only  one, two,  or\r\n\nthree   of  those   years.    The   Treaties  were   open  to\r\n\nrenegotiation each year, and  certain changes, e.g., relating\r\n\nto commission structure and the like, were in fact made.\r\n\n          For each Treaty year  there were actually two slips\r\n\nprepared,  one for  property  business and  one for  casualty\r\n\nbusiness.   The business  covered by  each  slip was  further\r\n\ndivided  into  \"system business\"  and  \"non-system business.\"\r\n\n\"System business\"  denoted risks written by  member companies\r\n\nof the Hartford, and included,  among others, First State and\r\n\nthe Hartford itself.  \"Non-system business\" referred to risks\r\n\nwritten  by any  other primary  insurer.   As a  condition of\r\n\nparticipation,   although  not   included   in  the   written\r\n\ncontracts, Bailey  insisted that  no  non-system business  be\r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\nceded to the SANS Treaties for the first year.   He testified\r\n\nin  his deposition  that this  was because  he felt  that the\r\n\nsystem  business  was  \"the  steadier,  better  part  of  the\r\n\nportfolio.\"\r\n\n          B.  Performance of the Treaties\r                          Performance of the Treaties\r\n\n          Once the  Treaties were  fully placed for  the 1980\r\n\ntreaty  year,  NERCO  began  retroceding  to  the  plaintiffs\r\n\nportions  of the  risks it  was reinsuring.   Central  to the\r\n\nplaintiffs'  present complaint, and  to the  district court's\r\n\nfinding of liability,  are the source  and nature of  NERCO's\r\n\nbusiness  as ceded  to  them.   In the  first  year, over  95\r\n\npercent  of  the  business  so  ceded  was  system  business.\r\n\nHowever,  few, if  any,  of  the  risks reinsured  were  from\r\n\nHartford companies  other than First  State.  In  the ensuing\r\n\nthree years,  the proportion  of system business  declined in\r\n\nfavor  of non-system business to less than 50 percent.  There\r\n\nwas evidence  that defendants had hoped  that system business\r\n\nwould  grow and  that NERCO  and its  retrocessionaires would\r\n\nobtain  more  reinsurance  business directly  from  the other\r\n\nHartford  companies, in  addition  to First  State, but  that\r\n\nthese hopes were not realized.\r\n\n          The proportion of non-system business rose steadily\r\n\nafter  the first year, but  the non-system business  was of a\r\n\nkind which plaintiffs contend,  and the district court found,\r\n\nwas  different   from  that   represented   in  the   Placing\r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\nInformation.  The court  construed the Placing Information as\r\n\nrepresenting  \"that Graham Watson  would produce 'non-system'\r\n\nreinsurance   business   directly   from  primary   insurance\r\n\ncompanies without the use of intermediaries.\"  In support  of\r\n\nthe court's construction, plaintiffs point to representations\r\n\nin the Placing Information that Graham Watson did  not intend\r\n\nto seek  reinsurance  \"on  a wholesale  basis  from  all  and\r\n\nsundry\" but  rather to  develop a close  working relationship\r\n\n\"with  selected primary companies.\"   The Placing Information\r\n\nstated  that non-brokered business \"placed significantly with\r\n\nthe  direct  professional  reinsurance market\"  characterized\r\n\nover  80 percent  of United  States  facultative reinsurance.\r\n\nThe Placing  Information also  stated that Graham  Watson was\r\n\n\"charged   with  the   responsibility  of   penetrating  this\r\n\nbusiness.\"  Notwithstanding these announced intentions in the\r\n\nPlacing Information, most  of defendants' growing  non-system\r\n\nbusiness  after the end of  1980 was, in  fact, obtained from\r\n\nintermediaries    to wit, brokers and Managing General Agents\r\n\n(\"MGAs\").  MGAs serve as agents of primary insurance carriers\r\n\nwith authority  to underwrite  and place certain  business on\r\n\nthe insurers'  behalf.   Defendants received the  majority of\r\n\ntheir non-system business, portions  of which were then ceded\r\n\nto the  plaintiffs under  the SANS  Treaties, from  Baccala &amp;\r\n\nShoop Insurance  Services, an  MGA representing a  variety of\r\n\nprimary insurance companies.   Baccala &amp; Shoop worked closely\r\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n\nwith the broker, G.L. Hodson; in fact, they were owned by the\r\n\nsame entity.\r\n\n          1.  Semi-Automatic and Automatic Facilities\r                          Semi-Automatic and Automatic Facilities\r\n\n          Another key issue  in the present  litigation stems\r\n\nfrom  the fact that, during the annual periods covered by the\r\n\nTreaties,  almost   all  of  the  non-system   business  that\r\n\ndefendants  produced, and  shared  with  the plaintiffs,  was\r\n\nunderwritten   using   what   are    called   \"semi-automatic\r\n\nfacilities.\"   (A  \"facility\"  is an  agreement setting  out,\r\n\namong other things,  the rules under  which a reinsurer  will\r\n\nreinsure  risks ceded by the other party.)  Defendants insist\r\n\nthat semi-automatic facilities were perfectly consistent with\r\n\nthe  representations  in  the  slips and  Treaties  that  the\r\n\nreinsurance  to be  ceded  to plaintiffs  would be  \"business\r\n\nclassified by the Reassured  [NERCO] as Property and Casualty\r\n\nFacultative   Assumed   business.\"     (Emphasis   supplied.)\r                       \r\n\nPlaintiffs   sharply  dispute  this.     Calling  facultative\r\n\nunderwriting the  \"fundamental  material  term  in  the  SANS\r\n\nTreaties,\" the district court agreed with plaintiffs that the\r\n\nterm \"facultative\" included only reinsurance that a reinsurer\r\n\nunderwrites  and negotiates  with  the primary  insurer on  a\r\n\nrisk-by-risk individual certificate basis in advance, i.e., a\r\n\ncertificate of reinsurance is issued  for each risk after the\r\n\nreinsurer has first looked  into and approved reinsuring that\r\n\nparticular risk.\r\n\n                             -15-\r\r\n\n          Under  the  semi-automatic  method that  defendants\r\n\nmostly used  in  underwriting non-system  risks,  defendants'\r\n\nunderwriters  did not evaluate risks one at a time in advance\r\n\nof  the issuance  of a  policy of  reinsurance on  each risk.\r\n\nInstead,    in    contracts   called    \"Master   Facultative\r\n\nCertificates\" (\"MFCs\"), NERCO agreed  with an MGA, broker, or\r\n\nprimary   insurer  that   the  latter   entity  could   issue\r\n\nreinsurance upon  risks of described types,  and upon certain\r\n\nconditions and  with  certain limits,  prior  to  defendants'\r\n\nunderwriters' scrutiny and approval  of the risk.   After the\r                                                                     \r\n\nreinsurance  attached to  each  risk, however,  the agent  or\r\n\nceding company would send to Graham Watson a \"risk bordereau\"\r\n\n    a  document  identifying   and  providing  a  summary  of\r\n\ninformation as to that, and any other, risks reinsured within\r\n\nthe  reporting period.  Graham Watson then had a brief period\r\n\nafter receipt of  the bordereau, for example 72 hours, within\r\n\nwhich to cancel the reinsurance on a particular risk if it so\r\n\ndesired, cancellation  to  take  effect  within  a  specified\r\n\nperiod, say, 14 days.\r\n\n          Defendants  contend,  and  presented   evidence  at\r\n\ntrial,   that  the   semi-automatic   facility  is   commonly\r\n\nclassified  in the  industry today as  a form  of facultative\r\n\nreinsurance.     They  concede  that,  in   an  earlier  era,\r\n\n\"facultative\"  was   a  term  applied   only  to  reinsurance\r\n\nindividually  underwritten on a risk-by-risk basis in advance\r\n\n                             -16-\r\r\n\nof binding.  But  while accepting that the  reinsurer's right\r\n\nto  reject  individual risks  remains  a  general feature  of\r\n\nfacultative reinsurance, defendants contend that this feature\r\n\nis  adequately   preserved  in   the   more  economical   and\r\n\nstreamlined semi-automatic facility.11\r\n\n          Defendants  also  used,  in   a  few  instances,  a\r\n\nvariation known as  an \"automatic facility.\"  Under this type\r\n\nof  facility,  rather  than  having the  right  to  cancel an\r\n\nindividual risk,  the reinsurer has  the right to  cancel the\r\n\nentire facility on very short notice.  Even without the right\r\n\nto cancel a  particular risk, defendants argue that  this was\r\n\n\"facultative,\"  since  the  reinsured would,  as  a practical\r\n\nmatter,  agree to  cancel individual  risks rather  than face\r\n\ncancellation of the entire facility.  Moreover, the reinsured\r\n\nretained  the freedom  to cede  or not  to cede  a particular\r\n\nrisk,  which   is  not   the  case  in   treaty  reinsurance.\r\n\nAutomatics comprised  only a small portion  of the non-system\r\n\nbusiness,  most  of   which  was  underwritten   using  semi-\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.  Because of  the cedent's right of  cancellation, and the\r\nreinsured's right  not to cede, defendants  and their experts\r\ncontend  that  the  semi-automatic  facility  is  a  form  of\r\nfacultative   reinsurance,  and  is  not  forbidden  \"treaty\"\r\nreinsurance.     The  SANS  Treaties   contained  an  express\r\nexclusion  for  \"assumed  treaty\"   business.    In  \"treaty\"\r\nreinsurance, the reinsurance arises solely as the consequence\r\nof the terms of  a prior general contract,  with no right  on\r\nthe reinsurer's part  to reject a particular  risk that meets\r\nthe  terms  of the  contract, and  without  any right  on the\r\nreinsured's part to decline to cede a particular risk, always\r\nassuming that the risk  in question conforms to the  terms of\r\nthe prior contract.  \r\n\n                             -17-\r\r\n\nautomatics.\r\n\n          2.  The First State Business\r                          The First State Business\r\n\n          With regard  to system business  (which was  almost\r\n\nexclusively with  First State), the defendants did  not use a\r\n\nrisk  bordereau,  nor  did  they ever  enter  into  a  formal\r\n\ncontractual  arrangement  spelling   out  First  State's  and\r\n\nNERCO's relationship in respect to the latter's reinsuring of\r\n\nrisks later  assigned  under the  SANS Treaties.   There  was\r\n\nevidence, however, indicating how matters worked in practice.\r\n\nIn  practice,  First  State's  underwriters  had  the   power\r\n\ninitially  to commit NERCO and the SANS Treaty signatories to\r\n\nthe reinsuring of individual risks primarily insured by First\r\n\nState.   The reinsurance was evidenced by a layoff sheet that\r\n\nFirst State  prepared; each  layoff sheet identified  a First\r\n\nState  risk that  NERCO  and the  Treaty signatories  were to\r\n\nreinsure, and  provided a brief summary  of information about\r\n\nthat risk.  A  packet containing many of these  layoff sheets\r\n\nwas periodically  provided by  First State to  Graham Watson,\r\n\nwhose underwriter could  study the risks  and would have  the\r\n\nright to cancel the reinsurance at will.\r\n\n          Defendants   contend   that    this   method    was\r\n\n\"facultative\" because each risk was individually evaluated in\r\n\ndue  course  by a  Graham  Watson  underwriter based  on  the\r\n\ninformation provided on the layoff sheets    and by follow-up\r\n\nphone  and face-to-face  inquiries, as  well as  by  means of\r\n\n                             -18-\r\r\n\nmicrofiches   which   reproduced    First   State's    entire\r\n\nunderwriting file for a risk, and were available upon request\r\n\n    and it was understood that the reinsurance was subject to\r\n\ncancellation at will by  Graham Watson.  They point  out that\r\n\nbecause  First  State's  and Graham  Watson's  employees were\r\n\nunder  the same roof and  answerable to the  same bosses, the\r\n\nlatter's  underwriters could informally influence First State\r\n\nnot  to cede  business the  latter did  not wish,  as further\r\n\nevidence  of their facultative  control.  Notwithstanding the\r\n\nabsence of a written  understanding between Graham Watson and\r\n\nFirst  State, the  district  court found,  after hearing  the\r\n\nevidence,  that,  \"Graham   Watson  underwrote  all  \"'system\r\n\nbusiness' .  . .  by the 'automatic'  and/or 'semi-automatic'\r\n\nmethod  of  underwriting.\"    Since  practically  all  system\r\n\nbusiness  was with  First  State, this  finding grouped  that\r\n\nunderwriting with the  explicit semi-automatic and  automatic\r\n\nfacilities used in non-system business.\r\n\n          3.  Further Performance\r                          Further Performance\r\n\n          At trial,  plaintiffs made  much of the  absence of\r\n\nproof  of  particular  occasions  when  defendants  had  ever\r\n\nactually  rejected a  risk listed  in a  bordereau or  layoff\r\n\nsheet.    Plaintiffs  also  sharply  questioned  whether  the\r\n\ninformation   in  the  bordereaux   and  layoff   sheets  was\r\n\nsufficient to allow for adequate underwriting (evaluation) of\r\n\nindividual  risks.  Defendants responded by emphasizing that,\r\n\n                             -19-\r\r\n\nwhether  or  not  used, the  right  to  reject  at all  times\r\n\nexisted, and  by pointing  to evidence that  its underwriters\r\n\nadequately reviewed the risks and had other means    personal\r\n\ninquiries,  telephone calls, inspection of First State files,\r\n\nand so on     to make inquiry in doubtful cases.  Defendants'\r\n\nevidence also indicated that Graham Watson conducted periodic\r\n\naudits of the  underwriting practices of  MGAs and others  in\r\n\norder to  assess  compliance with  the terms  of the  various\r\n\nfacilities.    The  district  court found  no  evidence  that\r\n\ndefendants  had  rejected any  risks  and  found that  Graham\r\n\nWatson's underwriting of individual risks was inadequate.\r\n\n          In  any  case,  while defendants  wrote  some small\r\n\npercentage of  reinsurance under  the SANS Treaties  that was\r\n\nfacultative in the traditional  sense of advance risk-by-risk\r\n\nunderwriting, most of the reinsurance produced under the SANS\r\n\nTreaties was  underwritten either  under some variety  of the\r\n\nsemi-automatic facility or, in the case of First State system\r\n\nbusiness, under  the informal in-house  procedures previously\r\n\ndescribed.  And, as  mentioned above, over the four  years of\r\n\nthe SANS Treaties, one MGA, Baccala &amp; Shoop, furnished almost\r\n\nall  of the  non-system business  to defendants.   Non-system\r\n\nbusiness was  found by the court  to constitute approximately\r\n\none-half of the treaty business during the four year period.\r\n\n          The agreement with Ralph Bailey to avoid non-system\r\n\nbusiness for the  first year was not to the  liking of Graham\r\n\n                             -20-\r\r\n\nWatson, whose employees  felt that non-system business  would\r\n\nbe a steadier source of income for the Treaties.  Bailey also\r\n\nmade  known his dislike of  MGAs and his  reluctance to allow\r\n\nMGA  business to  be  ceded to  the  SANS Treaties.    Bailey\r\n\ntestified  that, because  MGAs  did not  themselves bear  any\r\n\nrisk,   they  did   not  underwrite   as  carefully   as  did\r\n\nunderwriters on  the payrolls  of the primary  companies, and\r\n\nhence the  business  produced through  them  was of  a  lower\r\n\nquality.12    Again, this  was not  to  the liking  of Graham\r\n\nWatson;  one internal  memorandum,  dated December  11, 1980,\r\n\nstated that \"Ralph Bailey has an aversion to MGAs and he will\r\n\nhave to be  approached rather delicately because  a good deal\r\n\nof  the business going into this facility will be on business\r\n\nwhich is designed  to provide a real flow of  business from a\r\n\nsingle  source.\"  This memorandum also  noted that Tom Hearn,\r\n\nof Hodson, would  travel to  London on December  15, 1980  to\r\n\nattempt to  overcome this  aversion.  Responding  to repeated\r\n\nrequests from Graham Watson  employees, Bailey agreed at some\r\n\ntime  during  the first  year  to  begin allowing  non-system\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.  Conflicting points  of view were expressed  by insurance\r\nexperts  at trial  about  the relative  effectiveness of  MGA\r\nunderwriting, as filtered through  semi-automatic facilities,\r\nand   risk-by-risk  underwriting   on   a   \"direct\"   basis.\r\nDefendants offered evidence  that the losses sustained  under\r\nthe  SANS  Treaties were  less  than  those suffered  by  the\r\nreinsurance  industry  as a  whole  during  the same  period.\r\nPlaintiffs  did  not  attempt  to disprove  this  but  rather\r\ninsisted  that  the defendants  never  provided  the type  of\r\nreinsurance business they had promised.\r\n\n                             -21-\r\r\n\nbusiness to be  ceded to  the Treaties.   While he  expressly\r\n\nagreed  to the  cession of  certain  MGA business  during the\r\n\nfirst year (from  an MGA known as the London  Agency), he did\r\n\nso only with great  reluctance.  However, he did  not request\r\n\nor  insert  an exclusion  for MGA  business  in the  slips or\r\n\nTreaty Wordings for subsequent years, as he could  have done.\r\n\nNo such express exclusion was ever inserted.\r\n\n          4.  Renewal of the Treaties\r                          Renewal of the Treaties\r\n\n          The SANS Treaties were continuous contracts subject\r\n\nto  cancellation  \"upon  120  days prior  written  notice  at\r\n\nDecember 31,  1980 or  any subsequent December  31st.\"   This\r\n\nallowed  any desired adjustments to  be made in  the terms of\r\n\nthe Treaties  on a  yearly basis.   In practice,  all of  the\r\n\nretrocessionaires   cancelled   during  the   120-day  period\r\n\npreceding December 31, 1980 and then initialled new slips for\r\n\nthe next calendar year.   In order to induce  renewal, Graham\r\n\nWatson, again  through Hodson and  the European  sub-brokers,\r\n\ndisseminated a  document referred to as  the 1981 Anniversary\r\n\nInformation.    In addition  to listing  losses in  excess of\r\n\n$50,000 reported through September  30, 1980, and providing a\r\n\nsummary  of  the business  ceded  thus  far, the  Anniversary\r\n\nInformation included the following statements:\r\n\n          To   date,   the  preponderance   of  the\r\n          business  has  been  assumed  from  First\r\n          State Insurance Company  and written on a\r\n          pro  rata  basis.    Non-System  business\r\n          represents a  relatively small proportion\r\n          of the total and what has been written is\r\n\n                             -22-\r\r\n\n          limited to Casualty business on an excess\r\n          of loss basis  emanating from Baccala and\r\n          Shoop Insurance Services.\r\n\n          Because of the competitive climate in the\r\n          United  States, Non-System  business will\r\n          develop   more  slowly   than  originally\r\n          anticipated.    It  continues to  be  the\r\n          posture  of  Graham-Watson  not  to  seek\r\n          business  on a wholesale basis but rather\r\n          to  develop  close  working  relationship\r\n          [sic] with selected primary sources.\r\n\n          On  March 23, 1981, a meeting was held in Boston to\r\n\ndiscuss the performance of the SANS Treaties.  In  attendance\r\n\nwere Ralph Bailey and several  employees of Hodson and Graham\r\n\nWatson.  One major topic of conversation was the inclusion of\r\n\nMGA business.   Bailey  asked the Graham  Watson underwriters\r\n\nfor  their opinion of  Baccala &amp; Shoop,  and was told  by Bob\r\n\nWright, the  property underwriter,  that Wright knew  most of\r\n\nBaccala &amp; Shoop's home office people and was comfortable with\r\n\nthem.  Later in  the meeting, however, Bailey stated  that he\r\n\nwould not consider any new MGA business for the facility.  He\r\n\ndid  not, however,  make  this a  contractual requirement  by\r\n\ninserting  an exclusion for MGA  business in the  slip at the\r\n\nnext renewal.\r\n\n          At the close of the second year, a 1982 Anniversary\r\n\nInformation was disseminated, which  again provided a list of\r\n\nlosses and a  summary of  the business.   This document  also\r\n\nincluded  figures  as  to  overall  loss  experience  through\r\n\nSeptember 30,  1981, which  disclosed that the  SANS Treaties\r\n\nwere  losing  money.   Indeed, the  loss  ratio for  the 1980\r\n\n                             -23-\r\r\n\nTreaties  was an  alarming  248.65 percent.13   In  addition,\r\n\nthe  1982  Anniversary  Information  included  the  following\r\n\nstatements:\r\n\n          The  rating  basis of  these  treaties is\r\n          being  amended  with   effect  from   1st\r\n          January 1982 to  more accurately  reflect\r\n          the  basis  used by  Graham-Watson.   All\r\n          business other than that assumed from the\r\n          First  State which is  a \"system\" company\r\n          is being written on  a net rated basis in\r\n          that Graham-Watson is quoting their price\r\n          and if a ceding commission is required by\r\n          the  original company, this is then added\r\n          to the premium required  by Graham-Watson\r\n          . . . .\r\n          The  current sources of business is [sic]\r\n          as follows :-\r\n          FIRST STATE INS.

Loss  ratio  is  the  ratio of  net  earned  premium  to\r\nincurred  losses.    A  loss  ratio under  100%  indicates  a\r\nprofitable treaty;  a loss ratio greater  than 100% indicates\r\nthat more money is being paid to satisfy claims than is being\r\nmade in the form of premiums.\r\n\n                             -24-\r\r\n\ncontaining a list of  losses, a summary of the  business, and\r\n\nnotification of various  changes that had been made  over the\r\n\npast year, none  of which  are material here.   However,  the\r\n\nretrocessionaires   were  told   that   the   treaties   were\r\n\n\"continuing for 1983 basically as before.\"\r\n\n          Following  the placing  of the  SANS Treaties,  the\r\n\nplaintiffs at first accepted their shares of the premiums and\r\n\npaid their shares of  corresponding losses incurred by NERCO.\r\n\nThe  losses were  considerable, as  they were  throughout the\r\n\ninsurance industry at this  time.  Beginning as early  as the\r\n\nfourth quarter  of 1982,  however, certain of  the plaintiffs\r\n\nceased  paying losses.14   There  was evidence  that some  of\r\n\nthe plaintiffs (in addition to Terra Nova, through Bailey, as\r\n\nrelated  above) began to inquire  as early as  1982 about the\r\n\nuse  of MGAs  to  obtain business  (rather  than through  the\r\n\nformation of direct relationships with primary insurers), and\r\n\nabout the underwriting methods used by the defendants.\r\n\n          C.  The Present Lawsuit  \r                          The Present Lawsuit\r\n\n          In 1985,  some of  the plaintiffs retained  counsel\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.  The  district court  made no  findings as  to  when each\r\nindividual plaintiff first refused to make payments on losses\r\nincurred.   The plaintiffs  introduced evidence  which showed\r\nthe  last quarter in which  each plaintiff made  a payment to\r\nthe Defendants.   The  earliest was Kansa  Reinsurance, which\r\nmade  its last  payment in  the fourth  quarter of  1982; the\r\nlatest were nine plaintiffs including Uni  Storebrand, Sampo,\r\nand the  seven companies  bound through  Aurora Underwriters,\r\nall  of whom made their last payments some time in the fourth\r\nquarter of 1986.\r\n\n                             -25-\r\r\n\nand  sought to  conduct a  preliminary inspection  of NERCO's\r\n\nbooks pursuant to a provision in the Treaty Wordings allowing\r\n\na  right  of inspection  \"at  all  reasonable times  for  the\r\n\npurpose  of obtaining information concerning this contract or\r\n\nthe  subject matter  thereof.\"   NERCO  allowed  a seven  day\r\n\npreliminary inspection  in the fall  of 1985,  but a  dispute\r\n\nthen  arose between  the  parties  concerning the  conditions\r\n\nunder which any further inspection was to be conducted.\r\n\n          Evidently  dissatisfied with  the  results of  this\r\n\ninspection, and  concerned about  the growing loss  ratios of\r\n\nthe SANS  Treaties, a  group of sixteen  plaintiffs (of  whom\r\n\nseven are  no longer  parties) commenced this  action against\r\n\nNERCO  on January  6, 1987.   They  alleged  that they  had a\r\n\ncontractual  right  under  the treaties  to  inspect  NERCO's\r\n\nrecords, and  that although  they had previously  conducted a\r\n\nseven  day inspection, a  further, more exhaustive evaluation\r\n\nwas  needed.    They  sought   an  order  compelling  a   new\r\n\ninspection.   On February  13, 1987,  the  parties entered  a\r\n\nvoluntary stipulation allowing,  and establishing  procedures\r\n\nfor, a further inspection to be conducted by  Roy T. Ward and\r\n\nfour  of his employees.   On February 27,  1987, the district\r\n\ncourt entered  an order  allowing the inspection  to continue\r\n\npursuant to that stipulation.\r\n\n          Meanwhile,  in   late  1986  a   second  group   of\r\n\nreinsurers that had  continued to pay  losses to NERCO  while\r\n\n                             -26-\r\r\n\nthe  parties  discussed the  possibility  of  a commutation15\r\n\nretained a reinsurance inspection firm, Palange &amp; Associates,\r\n\nto inspect  NERCO's books  and records.   The  inspection was\r\n\nconducted in Boston in 1987.  Again, disputes arose as to the\r\n\nscope  and  methods of  this  inspection;  however, no  court\r\n\naction  was  required  to  resolve these  disputes,  and  Mr.\r\n\nPalange completed his inspection in the spring of 1988.\r\n\n          Following these inspections, on July  12, 1988, the\r\n\noriginal  plaintiffs,  now joined  by  the  remainder of  the\r\n\npresent plaintiffs, moved to amend their  complaint.  The new\r\n\ncomplaint omitted the substantive allegations of the original\r\n\ncomplaint,  and deleted  the  plaintiffs'  request  that  the\r\n\ntreaties be enforced.   Instead, the plaintiffs asserted that\r\n\nthe  treaties  had  been  induced  by  fraud  and  should  be\r\n\nrescinded.  They also asserted claims for breach of contract,\r\n\nviolation of Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 93A,    2, and  the Racketeer\r\n\nInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18  U.S.C.\r\n\n   1961-1968.  Denying these allegations, defendants asserted\r\n\nthe statute  of limitations  as a defense  and counterclaimed\r\n\nfor recovery  under the  challenged treaties, and  for treble\r\n\ndamages, costs  and attorneys  fees under  Mass. Gen.  L. ch.\r\n\n93A,   2.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  A commutation  is a method of  terminating a reinsurer's\r\nobligation  to pay  future claims  in return  for a  lump sum\r\npayment.    It does  not  necessarily  involve  any claim  or\r\nadmission of wrongdoing by the reinsured.\r\n\n                             -27-\r\r\n\n          Prior  to  trial the  defendants moved  for summary\r\n\njudgment on the statute of limitations issue, as well as on a\r\n\nvariety of  other grounds not  important here.   The district\r\n\ncourt held a hearing on the matter on January 15, 1992.  In a\r\n\nwritten  order  dated  January  16, 1992,  the  court  denied\r\n\nsummary judgment  on the statute of  limitations ground, with\r\n\nno explanation.\r\n\n          A  jury-waived trial began  on April 5,  1993.  The\r\n\nstatute of  limitations was raised  again during trial.   The\r\n\ncourt  delayed ruling until it could \"find out what the facts\r\n\nwere.\"  On the  twenty-second day of trial, the  judge stated\r\n\nsimply that \"[i]t seems that there is no problem with Statute\r\n\nof Limitations.\"   However,  the court appeared  to entertain\r\n\nthe issue again  two days later, accepting  a deposition into\r\n\nevidence  after  defendants argued  it  was  relevant to  the\r\n\nstatute of limitations.\r\n\n          The  trial  concluded  on  May 19,  1993,  and  the\r\n\ndistrict court  entered a  memorandum and  order  on June  7,\r\n\n1993.

The court held\r                      \r\n\nthat  the defendants had induced the plaintiffs to enter into\r\n\nthe treaties  by means of fraudulent  misrepresentations, had\r\n\nbreached their contracts with  plaintiffs, and had engaged in\r\n\nunfair and  deceptive trade  practices in violation  of Mass.\r\n\nGen.

The court\r\n\n                             -28-\r\r\n\nmade  no  mention  of  defendants'   statute  of  limitations\r\n\ndefenses.16\r\n\n          By  way  of  relief,  the  district  court  ordered\r\n\nrescission   of  the  challenged  reinsurance  contracts  and\r\n\nordered defendants to repay to plaintiffs all sums plaintiffs\r\n\nhad  previously  paid  out  on losses  incurred  under  those\r\n\ncontracts with  credit for  premiums paid to  the plaintiffs,\r\n\nplus  prejudgment  interest  at  12 percent.    Judgment  was\r\n\nentered for the plaintiffs in June 30, 1993  in the amount of\r\n\n$37,501,701.12   plus   postjudgment   interest  and   costs.\r\n\nFollowing  several  motions to  amend  this  judgment, a  new\r\n\njudgment was entered on  September 21, 1993 in the  amount of\r\n\n$38,118,940.07,  which   listed  the   amount  due   to  each\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n16.  The district  court also made no  specific resolution in\r\nits  judgment  of  defendants'  counterclaims.    It  can  be\r\nimplied, however,  as defendants  state in their  brief, that\r\nthe court  dismissed the  counterclaims \"sub silentio.\"   The\r                                                                 \r\ncounterclaims sought  to  hold plaintiffs  liable  for  their\r\nunperformed reinsurance obligations imposed by  the treaties.\r\nWhile it would  have been  better practice for  the court  to\r\nhave denied  the counterclaims expressly, its intent to do so\r\nis apparent from its rescision of the treaties as having been\r\ninduced  by  defendants' fraud  and  breached  by defendants'\r\nactions.  We have held, in parallel circumstances,  that such\r\nelliptical judgments will be  deemed to adjudicate all claims\r\nfor Rule 54(b) purposes notwithstanding their failure to deal\r\nspecifically with  the counterclaims in question.

The Fraud Claims\r                      The Fraud Claims\r\n\n          We  turn  now  to  the  substantive  issues,   and,\r\n\ninitially, to the  fraud claim  which is pivotal  to all  the\r\n\n                             -39-\r\r\n\ndistrict  court's  findings.    The district  court  saw  two\r\n\nfundamental  issues in the case, both of them relevant to its\r\n\nfinding  of  fraud.    One was  \"whether  Graham  Watson  did\r\n\nunderwrite  facultative reinsurance\"  on the system  and non-\r                                   \r\n\nsystem  business.    The  other was  \"whether  Graham  Watson\r\n\nproduced   'non-system   business'  by   establishing  direct\r\n\nrelationships    with   primary,    risk-bearing,   insurance\r\n\ncompanies.\"\r\n\n          A.  \"Facultative\" Underwriting\r                          \"Facultative\" Underwriting\r\n\n          Plaintiffs  argued, and  the district  court found,\r\n\nthat \"the parties to the contract\" (including, it would seem,\r\n\ndefendants themselves) \"understood the  meaning of that  term\r\n\n[\"facultative\"]   in  its  standard  and  traditional  sense,\r\n\nnamely, underwriting on a risk-by-risk certificate basis, the\r\n\nclassic  meaning  of  the  term.\"    825  F.  Supp.  at  382.\r\n\nAccording   to  the  court,   \"NERCO  knew\"  that  plaintiffs\r\n\nunderstood \"'facultative'  in  its standard  and  traditional\r\n\nsense of risk-by-risk  certificate underwriting and  was well\r\n\naware  that  it, itself,  was secretly  using  the term  in a\r\n\nspecial sense without ever disclosing such special meaning to\r\n\nthe Plaintiff  reinsurers.\"   Thus, the court  concluded, the\r\n\ndefendants'  representation  that   the  business  would   be\r\n\nunderwritten  on a risk-by-risk  individual certificate basis\r\n\nwas \"knowingly false when made.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\r                                                 \r\n\n          1.  No </span><pre class=\"inline\">Express Misrepresentation\r                          No Express Misrepresentation\r\n\n                             -40-\r\r\n\n          We hold that  these findings are clearly  erroneous\r\n\ninsofar  as  they  attribute  to defendants  an  implicit  or\r\n\nexpress representation that they would engage exclusively  in\r\n\nclassic  risk-by-risk,  individual certificate  underwriting.\r\n\nThe  record is without evidence from which a court could find\r\n\nthat   defendants   represented   to  plaintiffs   that   the\r\n\nfacultative business  underwritten by Graham Watson  would be\r\n\nlimited to individual certificate, risk-by-risk underwriting.\r\n\n          To be  sure, as the court found, there was evidence\r\n\nthat the overseas sub-brokers engaged to represent defendants\r\n\nby their broker, G.L. Hodson, understood \"facultative\" in the\r\n\nclassic  risk-by-risk individual  certificate  sense.   Nigel\r\n\nHuntington-Whitely,  the employee principally assigned to the\r\n\nSANS  Treaty placements by  defendants' sub-broker, Sedgwick-\r\n\nPayne,  testified  to  having  this understanding.    But  he\r\n\nindicated that  it \"may  have just  been an assumption,\"  and\r\n\ncould not identify the source of his understanding beyond his\r\n\nsense of what the term \"facultative\" might mean.  It was  not\r\n\nestablished that the sub-brokers were told this by defendants\r\n\nnor that prior to the initial (1980) Treaties the sub-brokers\r\n\ncommunicated this view to  plaintiffs or to defendants during\r\n\nnegotiations.\r\n\n          To  fill this gap,  plaintiffs point to Huntington-\r\n\nWhitely's letter of June 24, 1981 (well over a year after the\r\n\nTreaties  were entered  into), wherein  he states  in passing\r\n\n                             -41-\r\r\n\nthat \"Graham Watson is underwriting  each risk individually.\"\r\n\nHowever, this statement clearly did not induce the plaintiffs\r\n\nto  enter into  the 1980  and 1981  SANS Treaties,  given its\r\n\ntiming.   Moreover,  it is  arguable that  the semi-automatic\r\n\nfacilities, because they allowed Graham Watson's underwriters\r\n\nto reject  individual risks, were  a form of  individual risk\r\n\nunderwriting and thus not  necessarily inconsistent with this\r\n\nstatement.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs  also  point  to  the  1982  Anniversary\r\n\nInformation,  which  states  that,  on  non-system  business,\r\n\n\"Graham Watson  is  quoting  their  price  and  if  a  ceding\r\n\ncommission is required by the  original company, this is then\r\n\nadded to the premium required by Graham Watson.\"   Plaintiffs\r\n\nargue  that  this  specifically  describes   individual  risk\r\n\nnegotiation.  However,  it could  just as easily  be read  to\r\n\nrefer to  Graham Watson  quoting a  price during the  initial\r\n\nnegotiations  leading to  the  formation of  a semi-automatic\r\n\nfacility.  Thus,  it is  not an explicit  promise to  perform\r\n\nindividual risk-by-risk certificate underwriting.   Moreover,\r\n\nthis  representation,  like  the  statement   in  Huntington-\r\n\nWhitely's letter, was made  in 1981, and thus could  not have\r\n\nfraudulently  induced  the plaintiffs  to participate  in the\r\n\n1980 and 1981 SANS Treaties.\r\n\n          Defendants'   chief   executive,   Graves   Hewitt,\r\n\ntestified  at  the  trial to  having  told  one  of the  lead\r\n\n                             -42-\r\r\n\nunderwriters, Bailey, in 1979, about his dissatisfaction with\r\n\nthe method of using  a separate certificate as to  each risk,\r\n\nand his intention,  in connection with the  SANS Treaties, to\r\n\nuse a single controlling facility for multiple risks, as  was\r\n\nlater  done by means of the semi-automatic MFCs.  Because the\r\n\ndistrict  court found  -- contrary  to Hewitt's  testimony --\r\n\nthat  defendants had not disclosed  their intent to use semi-\r\n\nautomatics,  we  must  assume  that it  did  not  credit that\r\n\ntestimony,  although nowhere  in its  findings did  the court\r\n\nmention  and reject the testimony.   We do  not, in any case,\r\n\nrely upon Hewitt's testimony  in determining that the court's\r\n\nfraud  findings  premised  on  the  term  \"facultative\"  were\r\n\nerroneous.\r\n\n          Bailey  himself did  not attend  the trial  but was\r\n\ndeposed and  his deposition was read.   He did not describe a\r\n\nmeeting with Hewitt in  1979 nor any specific representations\r\n\nhaving  been  made  to him  prior  to  the  execution of  the\r\n\nTreaties  on the  character of the  facultative underwriting.\r\n\nHe testified  generally to \"understanding\" that Graham Watson\r\n\nwould assess and underwrite each risk separately, but did not\r\n\nrefer to any conversation or  occasion where any defendant so\r\n\npromised.   Asked if he would  have considered semi-automatic\r\n\nbinding  authorities to be  facultative underwriting, he said\r\n\nthat \"is not what I had intended and not what I had been told\r\n\nfrom my own  recollection.\"  This was the closest  he came to\r\n\n                             -43-\r\r\n\nsuggesting that he was  told by someone (defendants, brokers,\r\n\nor  others?) that facultative meant what the judge found.  We\r\n\nthink  this  vague testimony,  which  makes  no reference  to\r\n\nspecific sources,  falls short  of supporting a  finding that\r\n\ndefendants  expressly  promised  to  engage  in  risk-by-risk\r                      \r\n\nunderwriting only or knew that plaintiffs misunderstood their\r\n\nintentions in this regard.\r\n\n          2.    The Intended  Meaning  of  the Term\r                            The Intended  Meaning  of  the Term\r\n          \"Facultative\"\r                      \"Facultative\"\r\n\n          We similarly  hold  clearly erroneous  the  finding\r\n\nthat   defendants   \"knew\"    that   plaintiffs    understood\r\n\n\"facultative\"  to  be  limited  to  risk-by-risk  certificate\r\n\nunderwriting.    There  is   no  evidence  of  statements  or\r\n\ncorrespondence  by  plaintiffs  or their  representatives  to\r\n\ndefendants,  prior to  execution of  the slips  and treaties,\r\n\ninforming  defendants  that  the  plaintiffs  understood  the\r\n\nmeaning of facultative to be so limited.\r\n\n           Of course, if the court properly could have found,\r\n\non the basis of the evidence, that the term \"facultative\" was\r\n\nunambiguous, referring only  to individual certificate, risk-\r\n\nby-risk underwriting,  then defendants would  be charged with\r\n\nknowledge of that ordinary meaning.  However, as the evidence\r\n\nclearly showed, that term, both standing alone and as used in\r\n\nthe   Placing  Information,   slips,  and   Treaty  Wordings,\r\n\nencompasses  a variety  of  underwriting  methods, about  the\r\n\npropriety of  which the  parties and their  experts disagree.\r\n\n                             -44-\r\r\n\nWhether or not  a term as  used by parties  to a contract  is\r\n\nambiguous is  a question  of law subject  to plenary  review.\r\n\nITT Corp. v.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).\r\n\n          As noted, the district court found that the parties\r\n\nunderstood  the  meaning of  the  term  \"facultative\" in  its\r\n\n\"standard and traditional  sense, namely,  underwriting on  a\r\n\nrisk-by-risk  certificate basis.\"   If  by this  finding, and\r\n\nothers  like it, the district  court meant that  the term was\r\n\nlegally unambiguous,  being limited  in meaning to  only that\r\n\none type of underwriting,  it was wrong as  a matter of  law.\r\n\nExpert  testimony  and  treatises  presented  by  both  sides\r\n\nsupport  the  view that  the term,  as  used in  the industry\r\n\ntoday,  has  been   broadened  beyond   its  classic   roots,\r\n\nnotwithstanding  plaintiffs'  insistence  that   the  classic\r\n\nmethod is alone the proper one.\r\n\n          Most likely  the court  did not  mean the term  was\r\n\n                             -45-\r\r\n\nunambiguous  as a matter of law, but rather concluded, on the\r\n\nbasis  of  all the  evidence, that,  as  used in  the present\r\n\ncircumstances,  it  should  be  given  the  limited   meaning\r\n\nascribed.18  Yet  the district court  offered no reasons  why\r\n\nit gave  the term the  limited reading  it did.   Nor did  it\r\n\nexplain why it believed  defendants \"knew\" that plaintiffs so\r\n\nrestricted the term.   On the latter point,  it may have been\r\n\ninfluenced  by testimony  from defendants'  principal, Graves\r\n\nHewitt,  who  said he  had as  good  an understanding  of the\r\n\nLondon  insurance market as any American.  The judge may have\r\n\nfelt that,  possessing such  insight, Hewitt \"knew\"  that, as\r\n\nsome  English  witnesses  testified, \"facultative\"  would  be\r\n\nunderstood to mean  risk-by-risk certificate underwriting  in\r\n\nthat market.   But absent evidence that  Hewitt actually knew\r\n\nand  believed this,  such  a leap  would be  pure speculation\r\n\ngiven Hewitt's own contrary testimony.  \r\n\n          Moreover,   English   treatises   introduced   into\r\n\nevidence   by   plaintiffs  indicate   that,  notwithstanding\r\n\nplaintiffs'  witnesses, the  reinsurance industry  in England\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n18.  \"When the  written agreement, as applied  to the subject\r\nmatter, is in  any respect uncertain or equivocal in meaning,\r\nall the circumstances of the parties leading to its execution\r\nmay  be  shown for  the purpose  of  elucidating, but  not of\r\ncontradicting or changing its terms.\"  Affiliated FM Ins.

A leading English writer\r\n\non  reinsurance,  Golding,  describes  in  his  authoritative\r\n\ntreatise   (introduced  by   plaintiffs)  various   types  of\r\n\nfacultative   reinsurance   other   than   the   risk-by-risk\r\n\ncertificate variety.   One variation Golding describes is the\r\n\nso-called \"cover in course of post.\"  He states:\r\n\n                    It  will be clear  that much of\r\n          the  labour  involved in  the facultative\r\n          method  is  connected  with  getting  the\r\n          necessary  initials  on  the  slips.   In\r\n          modern  practice  this  can   be  largely\r\n          avoided  by the  system  of  what may  be\r\n          called giving cover \"in course of post\" -\r\n          - though the term nowadays extends to the\r\n          use of telex communications as much as to\r\n          the mail.    The reinsured  will  arrange\r\n          facilities with a  number of  reinsurers,\r\n          whereby  it may  issue  request notes  by\r\n          post, for one or more  lines of a risk to\r\n          be  reinsured,  as may  be  agreed.   The\r\n          reinsurers will then hold covered each up\r\n          to  the amount  of its  agreed  share and\r\n          remains so bound, unless and until it has\r\n          signified its declinature  \"in course  of\r\n          post\".    As a  rule  a  limit is  fixed,\r\n          within which this must be notified say 48\r\n          hours  after  receipt,  though  sometimes\r\n          this  is  extended up  to  as  much as  a\r\n          fortnight to allow for possible delays in\r\n          transmission.  If  no declinature is made\r\n          within the period, the reinsurer is bound\r\n          in  the ordinary  way.   The  system does\r\n          save a  great deal  of work, and  is much\r\n          favored by reinsureds  accordingly.

Golding also states:\r\n\n          The  subject  of facultative  reinsurance\r\n          w[ould]  not  be  complete  without  some\r\n          reference  to  the  form  of  reinsurance\r\n          called  a   \"facultative  obligatory\"  or\r\n          \"open cover,\" which is generally regarded\r\n          as belonging to  the facultative  section\r\n          of the business and  is often so  treated\r\n          in the books of a reinsurer.\r\n                    An open cover is  a reinsurance\r\n          arrangement under which the reinsured may\r\n          at  its option  cede a  share of  certain\r\n          defined risks, which share  the reinsurer\r\n          is bound obligatorily to accept.  Such an\r\n          arrangement thus partakes  partly of  the\r\n          nature of a  facultative reinsurance  and\r\n          partly of a treaty.   To the reinsured it\r\n          is   facultative  because   cessions  are\r\n          optional at its discretion.  . . . To the\r\n          reinsurer the open  cover is more  in the\r\n          nature of a treaty.  The obligation is an\r\n          obligatory one and it  applies not to  an\r\n          individual case  but  to all  cases of  a\r\n          given class that may be ceded.  No matter\r\n          how the  open cover may be  regarded in a\r\n          reinsurer's  books, it  is clear  that it\r\n          has  none  of  the  characteristics  of a\r\n          facultative reinsurance and in particular\r\n          it  lacks  the  fundamental feature,  the\r\n          power,   inherent    in   a   facultative\r\n          reinsurer,  to decline  a risk  if though\r\n          fit.\r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Golding,</span>  supra,  at  <span class=\"page\">46-47</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.    The  open  cover,  as Golding\r                           \r\ndescribes  it,  seems  somewhat  similar   to  the  automatic\r\nfacility,  except that  under the  open cover,  the reinsurer\r\nlacks  the ability to cancel the contract on short notice, as\r\nit may under the  automatic.  As the somewhat  anomalous open\r\ncover is  \"generally regarded\"  as facultative, so  much more\r\nmight  the  automatic  facility  be  so  regarded,  since  it\r\n\n                             -48-\r\r\n\n          But  even ignoring  these indications  that English\r\n\ncustom and  practice  have gone  beyond  classic  facultative\r\n\nmethodology, it is the American,  not the English, usage that\r\n\nseems  to  us key.   The  underwriters  in London  and Europe\r\n\ncontracted  in the  slips with  defendant NERCO,  an American\r\n\ncompany, for reinsurance \"classified by the Reassured [NERCO]\r                                                                 \r\n\nas   Property   and  Casualty Facultative   Assumed  Business\r                                                     \r\n\nproduced and  underwritten by  the Graham Watson  division of\r\n\nCameron  &amp;   Colby,  Inc.\"    (Emphasis   supplied.)20    The\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nexplicitly includes a right to reject  risks by rejecting the\r\nentire facility.  Automatics were, in any event, a minor part\r\nof  defendants'  business,  semi-automatics  having  been the\r\npredominant mode.\r\n\n20.  At footnote 7 of its opinion, the court stated that this\r\nlanguage\r\n\n          was  understood  by  the  parties  to the\r\n          contract  as  providing   NERCO  with   a\r\n          limited  discretion  in  classifying  the\r\n          types of  reinsurance  and that  is  this\r\n          Court's  interpretation  on the  basis of\r\n          the evidence.\r\n\nIt is  unclear precisely what the  court had in mind  by this\r\nstatement.   There was  testimony that the  contract language\r\nmeant that NERCO had discretion to classify a particular risk\r\nas  either a  property or  a casualty  risk; there  was other\r\ntestimony  that it  was  standard language  which gave  NERCO\r\ndiscretion to  determine what business was  facultative.  The\r\nplain  meaning of  the language  seems to  us to  allow NERCO\r\nreasonable, though  not unlimited, discretion  to decide what\r\ntypes of reinsurance fit  within the stated classification --\r\nnamely,  as  \"Property   and  Casualty  Facultative   Assumed\r\nbusiness  .  . .  .\"   Determining  whether the  business was\r\n\"facultative\"  as  well  as  whether  it  was  \"property\"  or\r\n\"casualty\" would all  be included.

One  might argue that  the district judge  was\r\n\nentitled to believe plaintiffs' experts over defendants' (who\r\n\ntestified  to the  opposite  understanding),21  and to  infer\r\n\nthat  the ordinary  meaning  of the  term \"facultative\"  was,\r\n\ntherefore,  the traditional  one of  risk-by-risk certificate\r\n\nunderwriting.\r\n\n          But  the  evidence  that  the  term  \"facultative,\"\r\n\nwithin  the  American market,  embraces  more  than just  the\r\n\nindividual risk  certificate method  is simply too  extensive\r\n\nfor the  court to have rejected.  Normally, of course, we are\r\n\nbound by the district court's choice among competing experts.\r\n\nBut  it is hard to gainsay experts such as defendants' expert\r\n\nJames  Inzerillo, see  supra note  21, when  even plaintiffs'\r                                        \r\n\nexperts did not categorically deny the widespread use, within\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n21.  Defendants'   experts   testified   that   \"facultative\"\r\nincluded reinsurance underwritten  by the semi-automatic  and\r\nrelated  methods.    One  of defendants'  experts  was  James\r\nInzerillo,   the   former   president   of   Munich  American\r\nReinsurance Co., the United States branch of Munich Insurance\r\nCo., the  largest reinsurer in  the world. He  testified that\r\nindividual risk underwriting was \"by no means\"  the only form\r\nof  facultative reinsurance, and that MFCs and semi-automatic\r\nand  automatic  facilities  were  all  forms  of  facultative\r\nreinsurance.  Moreover, he testified that the largest direct-\r\nwriting professional reinsurers in  the country all used such\r\nfacilities  in   their  facultative  operations.     None  of\r\nplaintiffs/  experts categorically denied  the widespread use\r\nof such facilities in facultative operations.\r\n\n                             -51-\r\r\n\nthe  facultative  operations   of  American  reinsurers,   of\r\n\nfacilities  like the semi-automatics  and automatics  here in\r\n\nissue.   Plaintiffs' experts did  not, in fact,  testify that\r\n\nthe ordinary meaning of the term in the American  reinsurance\r\n\nindustry  was limited to  individual certificate risk-by-risk\r\n\nunderwriting.   Rather they intimated that  this was what, in\r\n\ntheir own opinion,  the term properly  meant or should  mean.\r\n\nYet, the question  is not  the abstract use  of language  but\r\n\nwhether NERCO    having discretion under the slips and Treaty\r\n\nWordings    could reasonably classify the semi-automatic  and\r\n\nother  methods it used in its own operations as \"facultative\"\r\n\nand whether it committed fraud when it did so.\r\n\n          The best  approach to answering this  question lies\r\n\nin the  realities of  industry practice.

For instance, Langler, writing in America in the 1950's,\r\ndescribes  an arrangement very much like the MFCs used by the\r\ndefendants, which he places squarely in the facultative camp.\r\nHe says,\r\n\n          Such facultative business as is now being\r\n          done  by  Reinsurance  Companies  in  the\r\n          main,  is   transacted  under  Agreements\r\n          somewhat  similar to  the enclosed.

It is, however, the invariable right of\r\n          the Reinsurer (or should  be) to ask  for\r\n          the  cancellation,  within  5 days  after\r\n          receipt  of advices,  of  any cession  or\r\n          cessions submitted under the terms of the\r\n          agreement,  otherwise the  reinsurance is\r\n\n                             -53-\r\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          considered binding  on both parties.

Gerathewohl does state, as\r\na general proposition,  that facultative reinsurance  \"always\r\ncovers  a single  risk.\"   However, he  states, in  a section\r\nentitled   \"The   management   of   facultative   reinsurance\r\nbusiness,\"  that \"[i]n  order  to keep  the direct  insurer's\r\nmanagement  and  administration  operations  for  facultative\r\nreinsurance  business  at  a  minimum,  it  is  essential  to\r\nrationalize  -  ie  [sic]  standardize    -  all  operational\r                       \r\nprocesses  as far  as  the individual  nature of  facultative\r\nreinsurance  will allow.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 12 </span><pre class=\"inline\">(emphasis added).

Moreover,\r\nGerathewohl  is  a  German   author,  writing  for  a  German\r\nreinsurance company.  His views, while probably authoritative\r\nin that context, cannot be taken  as authoritative over those\r\nof writers  more intimate with  the common  practices of  the\r\nAmerican reinsurance market.\r\n\n                             -55-\r\r\n\ncontract requires  the reinsured  to report the  placement of\r\n\nthe  reinsurance to the reinsurer via a bordereau; and it may\r\n\ngive the reinsurer the right,  within a specified time frame,\r\n\nto  reject   any  particular  risk  thereafter       but  not\r\n\nnecessarily  ab initio.   The  semi-automatics in  issue here\r                                  \r\n\nwere designed  along these lines.   Facilities employing this\r\n\nmethod were developed  to offset the paperwork and high costs\r\n\nassociated with classic  certificate facultative  reinsurance\r\n\nindividually   negotiated  in   advance  on   a  risk-by-risk\r\n\nbasis.24     The  hallmark  of   facultative  reinsurance    \r\n\nevaluation   of  each  risk  separately  by  the  reinsurer's\r\n\nunderwriter    is  sought to be preserved  by maintaining the\r\n\nright  to  cancel  after the  fact.    Although  a window  of\r\n\nexposure  is  created during  which  the  reinsurer is  bound\r\n\nwithout his consent on what the latter may later decide is an\r\n\nunacceptable risk,  the potential for damage  is minimized by\r\n\nthe  relative  shortness  of  the exposure  and  by  contract\r\n\nconditions which  prevent  the  reinsured  from  binding  the\r\n\nreinsurer to  predescribed types of risks  the reinsurer does\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n24.

The record\r                                          \r\nsupports that  finding, in the  sense that the  practices and\r\nunderstanding between  First  State and  Graham  Watson  were\r\ngenerally  analogous  to  those under  the  formalized  MFCs,\r\nalthough  the close  employment  settings may  have indicated\r\ngreater de facto underwriting control.\r                            \r\n\n                             -56-\r\r\n\nnot wish to cover.25\r\n\n          We  conclude that there  is insufficient support in\r\n\nthe record for the court's  key fraud finding that defendants\r\n\nknowingly   misrepresented  to  plaintiffs  that  they  would\r\n\nreceive  one type  of reinsurance  (the  classic risk-by-risk\r\n\ncertificate form  of facultative), while intending  all along\r\n\nto provide another type  (semi-automatic and automatic).  The\r\n\nevidence  does,  indeed,  support  the court's  finding  that\r\n\ndefendants intended to supply reinsurance underwritten by the\r\n\nsemi-automatic  and (to  a  minor degree)  automatic  methods\r\n\n(although  not   to  the   complete   exclusion  of   classic\r\n\nfacultative, a small amount of which was also produced).  But\r\n\nthe record  does not support the finding  that the defendants\r\n\nknew that the plaintiffs expected to receive only the classic\r\n\nrisk-by-risk certificate form of facultative reinsurance, nor\r\n\ndoes  it support  the  finding that  defendants made  knowing\r\n\nmisrepresentations with respect to the term \"facultative\".\r\n\n          3.

The   district   court    found   that    semi-automatic\r\nunderwriting   differed   from   the   classic   risk-by-risk\r\nfacultative method  in that  \"the 'right to  cancel' and  the\r\n'right to reject' are effective only at the time the right is\r                                                            \r\nexercised by  the reinsurance underwriter and  well after the\r                                                                     \r\nreinsured  risks had attached  to the SANS  Treaties.\"  These\r\nrights were  not effective ab initio.

Graves Hewitt's testimony\r\n\nindicated as much.  He testified that most of the facultative\r\n\nbusiness   in  his   company's   NERFAC  division   had  been\r\n\nunderwritten  in the  classic individual  certificate manner.\r\n\nHe  wanted  Graham Watson  to  switch  to the  semi-automatic\r\n\nmethod  in  order to  get rid  of  the paperwork  and expense\r\n\nassociated  with  the  classic  method.26   The  record  also\r\n\nbears  the inference (assuming, as we  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">infer,</span> supra</span><pre class=\"inline\">, that the\r                                                               \r\n\ncourt discredited  Hewitt's  testimony that  he  so  informed\r\n\nBailey in  1979)  that defendants  not  only did  not  inform\r\n\nplaintiffs     or their own sub-brokers    of their intention\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n26.  Hewitt testified that when he approached Bailey in 1979,\r\nhe did so intending to short circuit the  classic facultative\r\narrangements which NERFAC was using because \"we had mountains\r\nof paper to  file . . . .  I  made it clear to  Ralph we were\r\nnot interested in doing business that way.\"  The court, as it\r\nwas entitled to, apparently rejected Hewitt's testimony.  (If\r\naccepted, it  would have  seriously undermined any  theory of\r\nintentional  misrepresentation.)    The  testimony  at  least\r\nindicates  that  Hewitt was  well  aware  that the  MFCs  and\r\naccompanying  modes  of underwriting  were  in  some sense  a\r\ndeparture  from past  practice. There  was evidence  of their\r\noccasional  use by NERFAC in  the past, but  most of NERFAC's\r\nunderwriting was by the traditional facultative method.\r\n\n                             -58-\r\r\n\nto streamline their  underwriting, but kept this  information\r\n\nto  themselves.    Does  it  follow  from  this  that,  while\r\n\nnegotiating the  SANS Treaties, defendants  designedly failed\r\n\nto volunteer  to plaintiffs  facts  material to  the risk    \r\n\ni.e.,  their  intention  to  use  this  type  of  facultative\r                                                        \r\n\nunderwriting     \"which honesty, good faith  and fair dealing\r\n\nrequire[d] that [they] should communicate to the insurer\"?  9\r\n\nCouch   38:2.\r\n\n          Although argued by plaintiffs, the above theory was\r\n\nnot  adopted by the district court.

Risks Obtained Directly from Primary Insurers\r                          Risks Obtained Directly from Primary Insurers\r\n\n          The district court's fraud determination rests also\r\n\non  findings  of  misrepresentations  in  the  1979   Placing\r\n\nInformation  concerning  Graham  Watson's  intent  to  obtain\r\n\nreinsurance  directly from selected  primary insurers without\r\n\nintermediaries.   The court found that  (1) NERCO represented\r\n\nthat it  would \"produce  'non-system business'  from primary,\r\n\nrisk-bearing, insurance  companies  directly\"; (2)  that  \"in\r\n\nfact,  it  produced  most  of such  business  from  [Managing\r\n\nGeneral    Agents]    through    intermediaries   and    from\r\n\nintermediaries  themselves,  and  yet  never  disclosed these\r\n\nmaterial  matters  to  the  Plaintiff reinsurers  as  it  was\r\n\nrequired  to do\"; (3) that plaintiffs had put their trust and\r\n\nconfidence in, and entered into the SANS Treaties in reliance\r\n\nupon,  the foregoing  representations  (as well  as upon  the\r\n\nsupposed  representation  of   individual  risk   certificate\r\n\nunderwriting,   rejected  above);   (4)  that   the  inducing\r\n\nrepresentations  to produce  and underwrite  reinsurance from\r\n\nselected  primary sources,  and by  a direct  approach rather\r\n\nthan through intermediaries, \"were knowingly false\" and \"were\r\n\nnot  kept  by  NERCO  nor  did  NERCO  intend  to  keep  such\r\n\npromises.\"\r\n\n          Two  complementary  theories   emerge  from   these\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nreinsurance, but rather improperly delegated those duties  to\r\nothers.\r\n\n                             -65-\r\r\n\nfindings.   First,  that defendants  never intended,  when in\r\n\n1979  they  wrote  and  circulated  the  Placing  Information\r\n\ncontaining  the challenged  representations,  to live  up  to\r\n\nthem.   Second,  that when  later, during  the course  of the\r\n\nTreaties,   it  became  apparent   that  \"direct\"  non-system\r\n\nbusiness was unavailable, and defendants decided to seek non-\r\n\nsystem business through intermediaries, they did not disclose\r\n\n\"these material matters, as [they were] required to do.\"\r\n\n          1.  Fraud in the Inducement\r                          Fraud in the Inducement\r\n\n          The   first  theory   amounts   to  fraud   in  the\r\n\ninducement.   While the misrepresentations were of intentions\r\n\nas  to a  course  of action  in  the future,  the  deliberate\r\n\nmisstatement of present intentions can constitute fraud.\r\n\n          Present intention as to a future act is a\r\n          fact.  It is  susceptible of proof.  When\r\n          such intention  does not exist, .  . . it\r\n          is a misrepresentation of a material fact\r\n          . . . .   The  statement of  fact  as  to\r\n          present intention of the defendant, being\r\n          susceptible of actual knowledge and being\r\n          a fact alleged to have been false, may be\r\n          made  the  foundation  of an  action  for\r\n          deceit.\r\n\nFeldman  v.

It is true  the Placing\r\n\nInformation  was   never  incorporated  into   the  contracts\r\n\n(consisting  of   the  slips  and  Treaty   Wordings).    But\r\n\ndefendants  prepared and  circulated the  Placing Information\r\n\nspecifically  to  induce   persons  and  entities  like   the\r\n\n                             -66-\r\r\n\nplaintiffs  to  enter into  the  Treaties.

They  also argue that at all times  they did have\r\n\nan ongoing  direct relationship with First  State.  Utilizing\r\n\nbrokers and  MGAs to provide NERCO  with reinsurance business\r\n\nwas said to  have occurred  only after it  was apparent  that\r\n\nthese earlier, sincere efforts had failed.\r\n\n          But the court was entitled to find otherwise, as it\r\n\ndid.  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Anderson,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">573-74</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(if evidence is subject to\r                          \r\n\nmore than one reasonable interpretation, it cannot be clearly\r\n\nerroneous).    Before  the Placing  Information  was written,\r\n\nthere was  evidence that NERCO commonly  used intermediaries.\r\n\nStatements by  defendants' witnesses at trial  and in certain\r\n\nof defendants'  planning documents  issued prior to  the SANS\r\n\nTreaties suggest an  intention to  continue to do  so in  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n30.  Defendants challenge  the district court's  finding that\r\nall  plaintiffs  relied  on  these  misrepresentations.    We\r\ndiscuss reliance in the following section.\r\n\n                             -67-\r\r\n\nGraham Watson operation.   And defendants' efforts, after the\r\n\nTreaties were in place, to secure non-brokered business could\r\n\nbe found to be  predictably ineffectual, further suggesting a\r\n\nlack of intention to secure the direct business described  in\r\n\nthe   Placing   Information.      The   Placing   Information\r\n\nrepresentations,  it  might  be inferred,  more  reflected  a\r\n\ncalculated  effort to  entice  plaintiffs to  enter into  the\r\n\nTreaties than honestly  to project defendants' real  business\r\n\nplans.  While susceptible of another construction, the record\r\n\nadequately  supports the court's finding that representations\r\n\nin  the  Placing Information  as  to  Graham Watson's  direct\r\n\nwriting intentions were knowingly misstated.\r\n\n          Defendants argue  that even  though NERCO  may have\r\n\nused   intermediaries,  it  nonetheless   complied  with  its\r\n\nrepresentation  that  it   would  develop  a  close   working\r\n\nrelationship  with primary companies.   Defendants  point out\r\n\nthat the reinsurance it wrote with the  aid of intermediaries\r\n\ncame,  for  the  most  part,  from  highly  regarded  primary\r\n\ninsurance companies.  They also argue that the intermediaries\r\n\nenabled them  to develop  relationships with  these companies\r\n\nthat might, in time,  become \"direct.\"  But the  court, as it\r\n\ndid,  was  entitled  to   read  the  Placing  Information  as\r\n\ninconsistent  with the securing  of business  through brokers\r\n\nand MGAs.   The Placing  Information says, for  example, that\r\n\n\"[f]aculative   reinsurance    emanating   from   reinsurance\r\n\n                             -68-\r\r\n\nintermediaries will continue to be written separately through\r\n\nNERFAC.\"   While defendants seek to place a different meaning\r\n\non this, the  court was entitled to read this  as saying that\r\n\nbusiness through  intermediaries  would  not  be  handled  by\r\n\nGraham Watson.   And  there were other  statements supporting\r\n\nthe same impression.\r\n\n          The court was entitled  to conclude that there were\r\n\nsignificant  differences  between  a   \"direct\"  relationship\r\n\nbetween  NERCO   and   selected  primary   insurers   and   a\r\n\nrelationship by  brokers and  MGAs.  These  differences could\r\n\naffect the quality of the business, at least in some people's\r\n\nminds, and might  have caused some plaintiffs,  had they been\r\n\naware  of  defendants'  actual  plans,  to  reevaluate  their\r\n\ndecision to participate in the SANS Treaties.  In the case of\r\n\nbusiness  obtained  through  MGAs,  for   instance,  the  MGA\r\n\nunderwrote the risk  for the primary  insurer (as opposed  to\r\n\nthe  underwriting  being  performed  by  the  primary insurer\r\n\nitself);   communications,   premiums,   and  reporting   and\r\n\naccounting documents were routed through the broker.  The MGA\r\n\nwas not  at risk should an actual loss arise.  Bailey, a lead\r\n\nunderwriter, strenuously objected to business underwritten by\r\n\nintermediaries, regarding it as of lesser quality.  The court\r\n\nwas entitled to believe that the non-system business provided\r\n\nthrough Baccala and Shoop and others was materially different\r\n\nfrom the  business represented  in  the Placing  Information.\r\n\n                             -69-\r\r\n\nWe,  therefore,  affirm  the  district court's  finding  that\r\n\nmaterial and  knowing  misrepresentations were  made  in  the\r\n\nPlacing Information in 1979.\r\n\n          2.  Concealment\r                          Concealment\r\n\n          The court  also found  that NERCO \"never  disclosed\r\n\nthese material matters to the Plaintiff reinsurers as  it was\r\n\nrequired to do.\"   This appears to  be a finding that,  while\r\n\nthe  Treaties were in  effect, NERCO violated  its good faith\r\n\nduty  to  disclose  to   plaintiffs  matters  coming  to  its\r\n\nattention material to  the risk     most notably its  growing\r\n\nuse   of  intermediaries  for  non-system  business  and  its\r\n\nabandonment of the  plans set out in  the Placing Information\r\n\nto establish direct relationships with primary insurers.

This  trend, however,  was  not\r                   \r\n\ntotally unannounced  by defendants.  In  the 1981 Anniversary\r\n\nInformation,   defendants   revealed   that,   although   the\r\n\npreponderance  of that  year's  business was  system business\r\n\nfrom First  State, a \"relatively small proportion of the non-\r\n\nsystem business had been  written on an excess of  loss basis\r\n\nemanating  from Baccala  and Shoop  Insurance Services.\"   At\r\n\nthis  time,   Bailey was  already well  aware that  NERCO was\r\n\nreceiving the Baccala and Shoop business.  He objected to it,\r\n\nbut  finally went along for that  year.  Because Bailey was a\r\n\nlead  underwriter,  this  conceivably  (although  we  do  not\r\n\ndecide)  put all  the plaintiffs  for whom  he was  acting on\r\n\n                             -70-\r\r\n\nnotice that more  such business could  be anticipated in  the\r\n\nfollowing year,  yet  neither he  nor  anyone else  took  the\r\n\nsimple  precaution of  inserting  a prohibition  against this\r\n\ntype  of business in the renewal slips for 1981 and following\r\n\nyears.\r\n\n          The district  court dismissed the  1981 Anniversary\r\n\nInformation disclosure in the following finding:\r\n\n          Although  the  Plaintiff reinsurers  were\r\n          aware that Baccala and Shoop, an MGA, had\r\n          ceded to the SANS  Treaties approximately\r\n          five percent of the total business during\r\n          the  first  year, 1980,  they  were never\r\n          apprised that, during  the ensuing  three\r\n          years,  Baccala and Shoop  would cede the\r\n          majority  of  \"non-system  business\"  and\r\n          that other MGAs and  intermediaries would\r\n          cede,  in  conjunction  with Baccala  and\r\n          Shoop, most of the  \"non-system business\"\r\n          to the SANS Treaties.\r\n\nThis  finding  does  not  explain, however,  why  Bailey  and\r\n\nothers,  once on notice that business was being accepted that\r\n\nwas contrary  to representations in the  Placing Information,\r\n\ndid  not  continue  to  protest  and  try  to  head  off  the\r\n\nacceptance  of further  such business.   Moreover,  the court\r\n\nmade  no reference  to  other evidence  that  certain of  the\r\n\nplaintiffs may  have learned a considerable  amount about the\r\n\nnature and source of defendant's business during  the life of\r\n\nthe  SANS  Treaties.     Such  evidence  is  relevant,  under\r\n\ndiscovery principles, to the various statutes of limitations,\r\n\nincluding the three year  fraud statute, infra.  It  may also\r                                                          \r\n\nbe substantively relevant to plaintiffs' fraud claims and the\r\n\n                             -71-\r\r\n\nrecovery rights  of individual plaintiffs.   Although we have\r\n\nsustained  the  district  court's  finding   that  defendants\r\n\ndeliberately  misstated  their  business  plans  in  1979, if\r\n\ncertain plaintiffs renewed their annual participations in the\r\n\nSANS Treaties even after  becoming aware that defendants were\r\n\nusing intermediaries and lacked \"direct\" business, this could\r\n\naffect their right  to recover in fraud for subsequent Treaty\r\n\nbusiness, and might conceivably cast doubt as  to their right\r\n\nto  recover at all, on some theory of acquiescence or waiver.\r\n\nThese matters require  the making of  further findings as  to\r\n\nwhat  information  became  known   to  whom,  and  when,  and\r\n\ndetermination  of  the legal  effect  of  any such  knowledge\r\n\nand/or notice.\r\n\n          Therefore, although we affirm the  district court's\r\n\nfinding  that  knowing misrepresentations  were  made  in the\r\n\nPlacing Information, we direct that reconsideration  be given\r\n\non  remand  to  the  legal significance  of  the  information\r\n\nrevealed in  the 1981 Anniversary Information,  and any other\r\n\ninformation the court finds  was subsequently received by the\r\n\nplaintiffs, or  some of  them, as it  relates to  plaintiffs'\r\n\nrights  to abandon  their reinsurance  obligations under  the\r\n\nSANS Treaties,  and recover damages for  losses already paid.\r\n\nIn considering  such matters, the district  court should take\r\n\ninto account, among other  things, defendants' duty of utmost\r\n\ngood faith, the  identity of those plaintiffs affected by the\r\n\n                             -72-\r\r\n\nparticular  information,  the legal  effect on  plaintiffs of\r\n\ninformation possessed  by Bailey because of  his special role\r\n\nas  a lead underwriter, and  the fact that  the Treaties were\r\n\nrenewable annually.   The district court  did not discuss  or\r\n\nmake findings on these matters.  So as to leave a clear field\r\n\non   remand,  we   vacate   (without,  however,   necessarily\r\n\ndisapproving)  and  leave  for   further  evaluation  by  the\r\n\ndistrict  court,  the  court's  finding   that  NERCO  \"never\r\n\ndisclosed these material matters to the plaintiff reinsurers,\r\n\nas it was required  to do.\"  However, we  affirm the district\r\n\ncourt's   finding   that   the   defendants'   made  material\r\n\nmisrepresentations in the Placing Information regarding plans\r\n\nto obtain business directly from primary insurers and related\r\n\nmatters.\r\n\n          On  remand it will also be  necessary for the court\r\n\nto consider exactly  which of the SANS Treaties were infected\r\n\nby the  misrepresentations made in  the Placing  Information.\r\n\nThis question may be  affected not only by which  information\r\n\ncame to what plaintiffs during the term of the SANS Treaties,\r\n\nbut  also by  the fact  that the  business produced  by First\r\n\nState was  obtained directly, without the  involvement of any\r\n\nintermediary.    No part  of  that  business, therefore,  was\r\n\nseemingly affected by these misrepresentations although we do\r\n\nnot  foreclose the issue.  In  addition, because the district\r\n\ncourt  made  no subsidiary  findings  concerning the  various\r\n\n                             -73-\r\r\n\narrangements  under  which Graham  Watson  assumed non-system\r\n\nbusiness,    we cannot  tell  whether  all  of that  business\r\n\ninvolved the use of brokers and/or intermediaries, or whether\r\n\nsome  portion  of  it  was  obtained  directly  from  primary\r\n\ninsurers.   On remand,  the district  court should  take into\r\n\naccount  all  such  issues  in determining      assuming  the\r\n\nstatutes of limitations and other matters do not stand in the\r\n\nway of recovery    what relief to provide.\r\n\n          C.

See  9 Couch,   36:1 (\"Generally  speaking, a\r                               \r\n\nwarranty in the law of insurance is a statement, stipulation,\r\n\nor  condition which forms a part of the contract, whereby the\r                                                            \r\n\ninsured  contracts  as to  the  existence  of certain  facts,\r\n\ncircumstances, or  conditions, the literal truth  as to which\r\n\nis  essential to  the validity  of the  contract.\") (emphasis\r\n\nsupplied).   Warranties are typically  enforced regardless of\r\n\nreliance.  In the  present case, the Placing Information  was\r\n\nnot a warranty.

Shapiro,  584 F.  Supp. at  1249.   This\r                                        \r\n\nobviously cannot be said here of those plaintiffs who did not\r\n\npresent individual evidence of reliance, infra.   Plaintiffs'\r                                                          \r\n\ncounsel  conceded in  closing  argument that  what he  called\r\n\nsubjective reliance by the underwriter who wrote the risk was\r\n\nnot  proven here in many  instances.  We,  therefore, find no\r\n\nbasis  in  Shapiro  for  making  an  exception  here  to  the\r                              \r\n\nMassachusetts requirement  that a plaintiff  seeking recovery\r\n\nin fraud must prove reliance on the misrepresentations made.\r\n\n          As  direct  evidence  of  reliance   is  admittedly\r\n\nlacking as  to many  plaintiffs, the question  arises whether\r\n\nthere may be circumstantial  evidence of reliance to  fill in\r\n\nthe gap.  We cannot find such evidence.  The plaintiffs were,\r\n\nfor the  most part, unrelated entities  from several European\r\n\nnations.  They  were approached  by no fewer  than five  sub-\r\n\nbrokers.  Defendants, it is true, concede in their brief that\r\n\nthe SANS  \"placing materials  were distributed by  the London\r\n\nsub-brokers to prospective  retrocessionaires, including  the\r\n\n                             -77-\r\r\n\nplaintiffs, in London and  Central Europe.\"  But  delivery of\r\n\nthe placing materials to a plaintiff is not the same as proof\r\n\nthat the  recipient looked at and  relied upon them.   Nor is\r\n\nthe fact  that certain other plaintiffs read  and relied upon\r\n\nthe placing  materials evidence  that all plaintiffs  did so.\r\n\nSeveral of  the plaintiffs were  unable to produce  copies of\r\n\nthe  Placing Information from their  own files, and many were\r\n\nunable  to present the testimony of anyone who could say that\r\n\nthe Placing  Information was seen  and relied upon  in making\r\n\nthe decision to enter into the SANS Treaties.  There was also\r\n\nevidence that, at  least as  to some of  the plaintiffs,  the\r\n\nsub-broker soliciting  participation and the  underwriter who\r\n\nmade the  decision to participate were  corporate affiliates,\r\n\nthus raising the possibility of some motive for participation\r\n\nunrelated to the defendants' inducing statements.\r\n\n          In  light  of  these  facts,  the district  court's\r\n\nfinding  that  all  plaintiffs  had  relied  upon  the  false\r\n\nstatements  in  the   Placing  Information  is   legally  and\r\n\nfactually insupportable and must be vacated.   We remand with\r\n\ndirections for the  district court to determine which  of the\r\n\nplaintiffs  have  proven  reliance  in  conformity  with  the\r\n\nrequirements of  Massachusetts law,  and to deny  recovery in\r\n\nfraud to any plaintiff who has not met this burden.\r\n\nIV.       Contract Claims\r                      Contract Claims\r\n\n          We turn to the plaintiffs' contract claims.\r\n\n                             -78-\r\r\n\n          (1) The slips called for the cession of \"[b]usiness\r\n\nclassified  by the  Reassured [NERCO]  as  . .  . Facultative\r\n\nAssumed  business produced  and  underwritten by  the  Graham\r\n\nWatson division of  Cameron &amp; Colby  Co., Inc.\"   As we  have\r\n\nheld, the character of the business ceded could reasonably be\r\n\nclassified  as facultative  business.   We find  insufficient\r\n\nrecord  support   for  the   court's  finding   that,  \"NERCO\r\n\ncontracted under  the SANS Treaties that  Graham Watson would\r\n\nexamine each individual risk submission by the ceding company\r\n\non  a risk-by-risk basis and, if the  risk be accepted, . . .\r\n\nwould  then issue  an  individual certificate  to the  ceding\r\n\ncompany.\"   We accordingly reject, as  clearly erroneous, the\r\n\ncourt's finding of breach of contract based upon the supposed\r\n\nnon-facultative  character of  the reinsurance  retroceded to\r\n\nplaintiffs.\r\n\n          (2) The district court further found that\r\n\n          NERCO   also  breached   its  contractual\r\n          obligation   to   produce  property   and\r\n          casualty  facultative  assumed  business,\r\n          for under the  \"automatic\" and/or  \"semi-\r\n          automatic\"  method  of  underwriting  the\r\n          reinsurance business is actually produced\r\n          by the ceding source companies and not by\r\n          the original reinsurer.\r\n\nWe  hold this  finding to  be clearly  erroneous.   While the\r\n\nprimary insured  or its agent  may indeed have  the authority\r\n\nunder the automatic or semi-automatic methods to initiate the\r\n\nissuance of the  reinsurance, this can only be  done pursuant\r\n\nto the reinsurer's authorization in  the MFC or other advance\r\n\n                             -79-\r\r\n\narrangement.    The  reinsurance  was clearly  \"produced\"  by\r\n\ndefendants  by negotiating and  setting up the  MFCs or other\r\n\narrangements under which the business was assumed.\r\n\n          (3)  The  district  court  also  found  that  NERCO\r\n\nbreached its  contractual  representation that  the  business\r\n\nwould be \"underwritten\" by Graham Watson.  The district court\r\n\nfound  a  contractual  breach because,  under  the  automatic\r\n\nand/or  semi-automatic  methods   employed,  \"Graham   Watson\r\n\ndelegated  its  reinsurance  underwriting  authority  to  the\r\n\nsource  company  to  automatically  cede risks  to  the  SANS\r\n\nTreaties.\"   The  district court  was undoubtedly  right that\r\n\nunder  the   semi-automatic  and  like  methods,  the  ceding\r\n\ncompany, or  the MGA  representing  it, was  given the  right\r\n\ninitially to assign  the risks  to NERCO, and  through it  to\r\n\nplaintiffs,  before review  by Graham  Watson's underwriters.\r\n\nHowever,  this was done  under facilities  previously entered\r\n\ninto with  Graham Watson, containing  underwriting terms  and\r\n\nrequirements satisfactory to the latter.  And, in the case of\r\n\nmost  of the business, Graham  Watson had the  right within a\r\n\nstated  time to reject any risk upon receipt of the bordereau\r\n\nor  lay-off sheet disclosing it, if the risk did not meet its\r\n\nunderwriting approval.   Graham Watson  was underwriting  the\r\n\nbusiness,  albeit using  the streamlined  facultative methods\r\n\ndiscussed earlier in  the opinion.   As we  have held,  these\r\n\nmethods  fall within  the industry's purview  of \"facultative\r\n\n                             -80-\r\r\n\nunderwriting.\"  Our decision on that point dictates rejection\r\n\nof  the   district   court's  above   finding,  which   rests\r\n\nessentially  on   the  erroneous  view  that   the  types  of\r\n\nfacilities   defendants  were  using  were  illegitimate  and\r\n\nunacceptable underwriting vehicles.  We hold, therefore, that\r\n\nthis finding, too, was clearly erroneous.\r\n\n          Having  said  this,  we   remain  troubled  by  the\r\n\nevidence, and the  court's findings,  of possible  systematic\r\n\ninadequacies  in the quality  of the  underwriting performed.\r                                        \r\n\nConceivably,  underwriting could  be  so deficient  as to  be\r\n\ntantamount to a breach of the duty to underwrite.  Plaintiffs\r\n\ninsisted, with support from their experts, that Graham Watson\r\n\nwas less  than diligent in its underwriting  efforts once the\r\n\nrisks were reported  to it by means of the  layoff sheets and\r\n\nbordereau.   There was evidence  of delay  and of  inadequate\r\n\nunderwriting data.   There was also some evidence that Graham\r\n\nWatson's underwriters may never  have rejected a single risk.\r                                           \r\n\nThe district court found that Graham Watson did not have \"the\r\n\nquantity or quality of information it needed to facultatively\r\n\nunderwrite the  risks  ceded to  the  SANS Treaties.\"    This\r\n\nfinding was,  to be  sure, based  on the  court's incorrectly\r\n\nnarrow  definition  of facultative  reinsurance,  and  was in\r\n\nsupport of  its finding  that Graham  Watson did  not perform\r\n\nfacultative underwriting.   Whether, under  this court's very\r\n\ndifferent  view of  the propriety of  defendant's streamlined\r\n\n                             -81-\r\r\n\nfacilities,  Graham Watson's \"underwriting\" could possibly be\r\n\nfound  to  have   been  so  inadequate  as  to   violate  its\r\n\ncontractual duty to \"underwrite\"  is a question we are  in no\r\n\nposition  to answer.   We  leave this  issue to  the district\r\n\ncourt, on  remand, with  instructions to also  decide whether\r\n\nother considerations     such as  the bar of  the statute  of\r\n\nlimitations    leave it viable.\r\n\n          (4) The district  court found that NERCO  \"violated\r\n\nits contractual  obligation  to 'co-reinsure  for 10  percent\r\n\nparticipation on  all 'System Business'  ceded hereunder,' as\r\n\nrequired by  Warranty No.  2 in  the Slip.\"   Warranty  No. 2\r\n\nreads as follows:\r\n\n          2)  Reassured [NERCO] co-reinsure for 10%\r\n          participation  on  all \"System  Business\"\r\n          ceded hereunder.\r\n\nThe plaintiffs  argue that this  term was  inserted into  the\r\n\nSlips at Bailey's  insistence because he wanted NERCO to keep\r\n\na  significant risk in  the business, thus  providing it with\r\n\n\"an increased incentive to exercise care and prudence in risk\r\n\nselection.\"  They then argue that in fact, NERCO did not keep\r\n\na  10   percent  retention,  but  instead   obtained  outside\r\n\nreinsurance of  that 10 percent  which reduced the  amount of\r\n\nrisk it  kept for itself to  a \"minuscule\" amount.   In other\r\n\nwords,  they  read  the  Warranty to  require  a  10  percent\r\n\nunreinsured retention.   The  district court appears  to have\r                       \r\n\nalso  read  the warranty  in this  manner;  this is  the only\r\n\n                             -82-\r\r\n\nreasonable reading of the court's statement,  as there was no\r\n\nevidence  that NERCO  did not  initially  retain at  least 10\r\n\npercent of each risk it ceded.\r\n\n          The  defendants  respond  that  Bailey's  testimony\r\n\nshows  that the  intent of  the Warranty  was not  that NERCO\r\n\ncould not obtain any reinsurance of its retention, but rather\r\n\nthat NERCO should have  exposure to losses that was  equal to\r\n\nor  greater than Bailey's  firm's exposure.   They  point out\r\n\nthat the evidence shows that, in fact, \"NERCO's actual losses\r\n\non  the portion of the  SANS risk portfolio  that it retained\r\n\n(unreinsured) was $105,000,000      an amount virtually equal\r\n\nto  all of  the losses  of all  of the  plaintiffs combined.\"\r                                          \r\n\n(Emphasis in original.)\r\n\n          We  believe  the court  was  entitled  to view  the\r\n\nevidence on  this point as  it did.   There is no  doubt that\r\n\nNERCO  did reinsure  some  portion of  its retention;  Hewitt\r\n\nadmitted as much, and the plaintiffs introduced into evidence\r\n\nsome of the reinsurance  contracts used by NERCO to  reinsure\r\n\nthe retention.  There  was also evidence on both sides of the\r\n\nquestion  whether  the parties  intended  Warranty  No. 2  to\r\n\nrequire NERCO to keep an  unreinsured retention.  While there\r\n\nare   no   contemporaneous   documents   using   the   phrase\r\n\n\"unreinsured  retention\" or words  of similar import, several\r\n\nwitnesses,  including  Nigel   Huntington-Whitely,  who   was\r\n\npivotally  involved  in   the  negotiation  of   this  point,\r\n\n                             -83-\r\r\n\ntestified  that  an   unreinsured  retention  was  what   was\r\n\nintended.\r\n\n          The  issue of  what  the parties  intended by  this\r\n\nlanguage is an  issue of  fact, which we  must uphold  absent\r\n\nclear error.

As  we say  below, the  district court erred  in finding\r\nliability under Mass. Gen. L. ch.  93A.  Therefore, we do not\r\ndiscuss the  statute of  limitations relevant to  that claim.\r\nNor, do we discuss the statute of limitations relevant to the\r\nRICO  claim because  we affirm  the district  court's finding\r\nthat RICO does not apply to the facts of this case.\r\n\n                             -85-\r\r\n\nsatisfaction  of the factfinder, might necessitate evaluation\r\n\nof  whether any  or all  of  plaintiffs' fraud,  and possibly\r\n\nother,  claims were  time  barred.   There  is, for  example,\r\n\nuncontroverted  evidence that  the  lead  underwriter,  Ralph\r\n\nBailey, had  personal knowledge prior to  1981 of defendants'\r\n\nuse  of  the MGA  Baccala  &amp;  Shoop.   Another  matter  to be\r\n\nexamined   is  the   disclosure  in   the  1981   Anniversary\r\n\nInformation, distributed  to the plaintiffs in  late 1980, of\r\n\nthe fact that business had been assumed from Baccala &amp; Shoop.\r\n\nThere are also in the record other indications of information\r\n\nbeing  conveyed to one  or more plaintiffs  at various times,\r\n\nwhich need evaluation to determine whether the running of the\r\n\nlimitations periods  was triggered at those  moments and with\r\n\nwhat effect.   For  example, some  of the  plaintiffs stopped\r\n\npaying claims made by NERCO as early as the fourth quarter of\r\n\n1982.  The plaintiffs were obligated to make such payments by\r\n\ntheir  own reciprocal duty  of utmost good  faith, unless, of\r\n\ncourse, they had knowledge of a bona fide defense to payment,\r                                                     \r\n\nsuch as the defendants'  fraud.

The Chapter 93A Claims\r                      The Chapter 93A Claims\r\n\n          In  a footnote,  the district court  found, without\r\n\nmore, that \"the  conduct of NERCO constitutes  a violation of\r\n\nChapter  93A,  Section   2  of  the   General  Laws  of   the\r\n\nCommonwealth of  Massachusetts.\"   825 F.

L. ch. 93A,   2 declares unlawful \"unfair methods\r\n\nof  competition and unfair or  deceptive acts or practices in\r\n\nthe conduct of  any trade or  commerce.\"   Mass. Gen. L.  ch.\r\n\n93A,   11 provides for the  bringing of a civil action by the\r\n\nvictim  of such  practices.   An action  may not  be brought,\r\n\nhowever,  \"unless the  actions and  transactions constituting\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n33.  For  example, Eric  Verhes  of Compagnie  de Reassurance\r\nD'Ile de France  apparently knew  of the use  of Baccala  and\r\nShoop  by  mid-1982; and  plaintiff  Imperio  Re exchanged  a\r\nseries of  letters with NERCO via the sub-broker Carter Brito\r\nE Cunha Ltd.  in late 1984 discussing the use  of Baccala and\r\nShoop,  and commented in one dated December 21, 1984 that the\r\nfact that business was \"underwritten by Baccala and Shoop . .\r\n. would appear to be a further point contravening the wording\r\nof the Contract.\"\r\n\n                             -87-\r\r\n\nthe alleged unfair  method of  competition or  the unfair  or\r\n\ndeceptive   act   or   practice   occurred    primarily   and\r\n\nsubstantially within the commonwealth.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\r                                                        \r\n\n          The defendants </span><pre class=\"inline\"> argued below  as they do  on appeal\r\n\nthat the acts and practices said to constitute a violation of\r\n\n   2 did  not  occur primarily  and substantially  within the\r\n\ncommonwealth,  as  required by     11.   The  district court,\r\n\nhowever,  made  no  finding  on this  important  point.   The\r\n\nclosest the  court came to finding where the critical conduct\r\n\noccurred  was a statement, in  the course of  a colloquy with\r\n\ncounsel, that it  was \"implicit . . . activities  had to have\r\n\nbeen found in Massachusetts.\"  The court went on  to say that\r\n\nwhile  \"there were  activities  within the  state that  would\r\n\nconstitute  a violation of  93A, as I  found . .  . there are\r\n\nmore important activities, more crucial  activities that took\r\n\nplace overseas.\"  We are thus left without a specific finding\r\n\nand with considerable confusion  as to what the court  had in\r\n\nmind.  Given the absence of guidance -- indeed, with guidance\r\n\nthat points in  opposite directions --  we must determine  as\r\n\nbest  we can whether  the   11  locus requirement  was met on\r\n\nthis record.\r\n\n          In insisting  that the  acts and practices  said to\r\n\nconstitute  a   violation   did  not   occur  primarily   and\r\n\nsubstantially within the  commonwealth, the defendants assert\r\n\nas follows:   The  Placing Information  was prepared by  G.L.\r\n\n                             -88-\r\r\n\nHodson in  New York.   It was  then transmitted  to the  sub-\r\n\nbrokers in  London, and communicated by  the sub-brokers from\r\n\nLondon  to the  plaintiffs  at their  places  of business  in\r\n\nLondon and continental Europe.  The plaintiffs, to the extent\r\n\nthey  relied on  any  misrepresentations, did  so in  Europe,\r\n\nsigned the slips and Treaty Wordings in Europe,  and suffered\r\n\nany  financial  injury in  Europe.    As  the  judge  himself\r\n\nindicated, \"notwithstanding that there were activities within\r\n\nthis  state,  at  least  and  maybe  the  most  crucial  were\r\n\noverseas.\"  The latter  reason caused the court to  refuse to\r\n\naward double or treble  damages, a discretionary matter under\r\n\n   11.  Defendants argue that  this shows a misreading of the\r\n\nstatute, because if the district court found that the crucial\r\n\nactions creating liability had  occurred overseas, they could\r\n\nnot   have   occurred    primarily   and   substantially   in\r\n\nMassachusetts, hence he should have found no liability at all\r\n\nunder  ch.  93A.     Defendants  insist  that  if  misleading\r\n\nstatements  are made  in Massachusetts  but are  received and\r\n\nrelied  upon  outside  the  commonwealth,  there  can  be  no\r\n\nliability under ch. 93A.\r\n\n          The  plaintiffs  reply   that  the  district  court\r\n\nimplicitly  found that  the defendants  failed to  meet their\r\n\nstatutory burden of proving that their fraudulent conduct did\r\n\nnot occur  primarily and substantially  in the  commonwealth.\r\n\nPlaintiffs  disagree that  the only  relevant conduct  is the\r\n\n                             -89-\r\r\n\nplacing of the Treaties overseas, and argue that the relevant\r\n\nconduct includes (1) the location of the defendants and their\r\n\nbusiness, (2) the initial drafting of the placing information\r\n\nin Boston, prior to its communication to G.L. Hodson, (3) the\r\n\nfact  that  all  subsequent false  and  deceptive information\r\n\nemanated  from Boston,  (4)  certain  later meetings  between\r\n\nvarious plaintiffs and defendants, and between defendants and\r\n\ntheir brokers, in Boston, (5) the place of performance of the\r\n\ncontracts (Boston), (6) the  day-to-day operation of the SANS\r\n\nprogram in Boston, (7) the alleged obstruction of plaintiffs'\r\n\nattempts  to inspect NERCO's books and records in Boston, and\r\n\n(8) the reaping of the benefits of the fraud in Boston.  They\r\n\nargue that Massachusetts case law does not provide a  bright-\r\n\nline test for the \"primarily and substantially\" standard, but\r\n\nrather requires a \"pragmatic, functional analysis\" which must\r\n\ninclude  consideration not only  of where the communications,\r\n\nreliance, and injury took  place, but also where the  bulk of\r\n\nthe more mundane activities did not occurr.\r\n\n          A  finding   whether  the  defendant  has  met  its\r\n\nstatutory  burden   of  proving   that  its   activities  and\r\n\ntransactions   occurred   primarily   and  substantially   in\r\n\nMassachusetts is a matter of law, subject to plenary  review.\r\n\nClinton Hosp.

As in  that case,\r                                                    \r\n\nnon-Massachusetts  residents are  here attempting  to recover\r\n\nfor the allegedly  unfair trade practices of a corporation in\r\n\nMassachusetts, under a  statute designed  to protect  against\r\n\nin-state frauds.  As in that case, the defendant's day-to-day\r\n\nbusiness activities were largely carried on in Massachusetts.\r\n\nAs in that case, we shall assume that the allegedly deceptive\r\n\nacts or  practices    in particular,  the Placing Information\r\n\n   originated  in Massachusetts, but the  Placing Information\r\n\nwas  intended   to  be,  and  was,   circulated  abroad,  and\r\n\nplaintiffs  received and acted upon  it there.   The situs of\r\n\nthe plaintiffs' losses was  also in Europe.  It  follows that\r\n\nwith  respect   to  plaintiffs'   claims  of  fraud   in  the\r\n\ninducement,  the defendants  have met their  statutory burden\r\n\nunder   11 of  proving that their fraudulent conduct  did not\r\n\noccur primarily and substantially  in Massachusetts.  On this\r\n\npoint, we reverse the district court's ruling that defendants\r\n\nare liable under Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93A,   2.\r\n\n          This does  not, however, end  the matter.   In this\r\n\nopinion, we have sustained the district court's finding  of a\r\n\nbreach of contract stemming from defendants' violation of its\r\n\n                             -92-\r\r\n\ncontractual obligation  to retain 10% of  all system business\r\n\nceded to  the SANS  Treaties.   We have also  left open,  for\r\n\nfurther  consideration  on  remand,  a  contract  claim   for\r\n\npossible failure to perform underwriting as promised.  And we\r\n\nhave  left open the possibility,  on remand, of  a finding of\r\n\nfraudulent concealment  of the  use of intermediaries  and of\r\n\nother conduct  deviating from representations in  the Placing\r\n\nInformation,  in  the years  following the  initial Treaties.\r\n\nThe  above activities,  or  some of  them, might  conceivably\r\n\nsupport --  although we take  no position at  this time --  a\r\n\nfinding   of      2   violations   occurring  primarily   and\r\n\nsubstantially  within Massachusetts.   Accordingly,  while we\r\n\nhold that fraud in  the inducement based upon representations\r\n\nin  the  Placing  Information  did not  occur  primarily  and\r\n\nsubstantially within  Massachusetts, we  do not at  this time\r\n\nforeclose  liability under  Mass. Gen.  L. ch.  93A  based on\r\n\ndifferent conduct of the type mentioned above.  We leave such\r\n\ndetermination to the district court on remand.\r\n\nVII.

Thus,  in\r\n\nproving a right to recover for a RICO violation premised upon\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n34.

Damages\r                      Damages\r\n\n          The   district   court   ruled   that   \"[i]n   the\r\n\ncircumstances of this case, it  is not feasible to reasonably\r\n\ncalculate  damages  on  the  basis  of  the  'benefit  of the\r\n\nbargain' method  of damages.\"   The court  accordingly (after\r\n\nfurther  proceedings)  entered  judgment  in  the  amount  of\r\n\n$38,118,940.07  (which  sum  included prejudgment  interest),\r\n\nplus  postjudgment   interest  and  costs.     This  sum  was\r\n\ncalculated to  be the difference  between claims paid  by the\r\n\nplaintiff reinsurers less the  premiums they received  during\r\n\nthe course of  the SANS  Treaties.  The  district court  also\r\n\nannounced  in its Memorandum and  Order of June  7, 1993 (but\r\n\nnot  in any  separate judgment),  that \"the  only appropriate\r\n\nremedy  is  to  rescind the  SANS  Treaties  as  a matter  of\r\n\nequity.\"\r\n\n          Defendants  complain  on  appeal   that  plaintiffs\r\n\n                             -97-\r\r\n\nshould have been required  to prove, and could  only recover,\r\n\n\"benefit  of the  bargain\"  damages.   Defendants argue  that\r\n\nplaintiffs  in  fact suffered  no  damage  at all  as  \"[t]he\r\n\nresults achieved under the SANS Treaties were poor, but  they\r\n\nwere   better   than   industry   average   results   . . . .\r\n\nPlaintiffs'  experts,  who  utilized  individual  certificate\r\n\nfacultative  underwriting,  reluctantly  admitted  their  own\r\n\noperations lost money and were closed down.\"   In defendants'\r\n\nview,  the  losses  under  the  SANS  Treaties  were  due  to\r\n\n\"extremely  adverse market  conditions     low  premiums  and\r\n\nunprecedented loss experiences.\"   As the judge commented, it\r\n\nwas \"a disastrous  market.\"   Defendants go on  to point  out\r\n\nthat \"[t]here was no evidence that brokerage-located business\r\n\nresulted in larger losses than business obtained 'directly.'\"\r\n\n          The court, in  its opinion  excused the  plaintiffs\r\n\nfrom establishing  damages  because, for  plaintiffs to  have\r\n\ndone so,\r\n\n          it  would have  been necessary  to obtain\r\n          the financial records of the major direct\r\n          reinsurance     companies     . . . which\r\n          financial  records  are confidential  and\r\n          not accessible to third parties.\r\n\n          We find no  legal error in the  court's decision to\r\n\nfurnish  relief  for fraud  based  on  cancelling plaintiffs'\r\n\nreinsurance obligations under the  Treaties.  When an insurer\r\n\nestablishes that it was induced by fraud to issue policies of\r\n\ninsurance, cancellation of  the policy is a customary form of\r\n\n                             -98-\r\r\n\nrelief.   See, e.g., Century </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Indem.,</span> <span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> at <span class=\"page\">504-05</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 131\r                                               \r\n\nN.E.2d  at 769.   To  the extent  that these  plaintiffs were\r\n\nceded shares in reinsurance  under Treaties they were induced\r\n\nto  join,  and  continued   to  participate  in,  because  of\r\n\ndefendants' fraud, the district  court was authorized,  where\r\n\notherwise appropriate, to provide the remedy of retroactively\r\n\ncancelling  the  applicable Treaties,  reimbursing plaintiffs\r\n\nfor  their   net  losses,  and  absolving   them  from  their\r\n\nunfulfilled reinsurance obligations thereunder.\r\n\n          In this opinion we  have reversed the fraud finding\r\n\nbased on the  \"facultative\" representations, but  have upheld\r\n\nit  in respect  to reliance  on representations  in the  1979\r\n\nPlacing  Information  regarding  securing nontreaty  business\r\n\n\"directly\"  rather  than  through  intermediaries.    Thus  a\r\n\ncancellation remedy for fraud may still be appropriate  as to\r\n\nreinsurance  retroceded to plaintiffs  which was  infected by\r\n\nthat  fraud.     However,   we  have  remanded   for  further\r\n\nconsideration  of   whether  the  statutes   of  limitations,\r\n\nincluding that for fraud,  constitute a bar to the  claims of\r\n\nany   or  all  plaintiffs.     We  have   also  remanded  for\r\n\nconsideration whether,  at least in some  cases, the original\r\n\nfraud was dissipated, or its duration limited to a particular\r\n\nyear or years, by the receipt of knowledge of  the falsity of\r\n\nthe  earlier  representations  coupled  with  renewal  of the\r\n\nTreaty  or other  conduct indicating acquiescence  or waiver.\r\n\n                             -99-\r\r\n\nWe have further remanded for consideration of whether certain\r\n\nof the plaintiffs are barred from relief for fraud because of\r\n\ntheir failure to establish reliance.\r\n\n          We accordingly  vacate all  relief  granted by  the\r\n\ncourt and remand for further findings on what relief, if any,\r\n\nis appropriate in light  of the other findings that  are made\r\n\nupon remand.    If  there are  instances  where  recovery  is\r\n\nappropriate for  breach of contract only,  rather than fraud,\r\n\nthe court should determine the proper measure of relief, and,\r\n\nsubject  to  our rulings  herein,  the  district court  shall\r\n\nrecalculate the proper award, if any  is due, on the basis of\r\n\nits assessment of the law and facts.\r\n\nIX.       Prejudgment Interest\r                      Prejudgment Interest\r\n\n          The  defendants  argue  that  the  district court's\r\n\norder  rescinding  the  SANS  Treaties was  a  restitutionary\r\n\naward, not an  award of damages.  Thus, they say, the court's\r\n\nassessment of prejudgment interest at the rate  of 12 percent\r\n\nset  by  Mass.  Gen. L.  ch.  231,      6B,  6C, and  6H  was\r\n\nerroneous, because the rate of interest set by those statutes\r\n\nis applicable only to awards of damages, not to rescissionary\r\n\nawards.   They  argue  that the  plaintiffs  made an  express\r\n\nelection  of remedies,  choosing rescission  and restitution,\r\n\nand  thus foregoing  their  option to  pursue  the remedy  of\r\n\ncontract  damages  and  interest   on  those  damages.    The\r\n\ndefendants contend that prejudgment interest should have been\r\n\n                            -100-\r\r\n\napplied at the  rate of 6  percent set by  Mass. Gen. L.  ch.\r\n\n107,   3.\r\n\n          In light of the fact that we are vacating the award\r\n\nand remanding  this case  to  the district  court, where  any\r\n\njudgment eventually  awarded to either party  may bear little\r\n\nresemblance  to the judgment we vacate  today, we decline the\r\n\ndefendants' invitation to  consider this point at length.  We\r\n\nfind  it  of  interest, however,  that     6C  has been  held\r\n\napplicable to a recovery based on an action for money paid by\r\n\nmistake, Commercial </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2097983\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Union,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2097983/commercial-union-ins-co-v-boston-edison-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> at <span class=\"page\">555-56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 591 N.E.2d at\r                                     \r\n\n171-72, a recovery which  seemingly bears more resemblance to\r\n\nrestitution than to money damages.\r\n\nX.        Conclusion\r                      Conclusion\r\n\n          Appeal No. 93-2339\r                                        \r\n\n          We  sustain  the   district  court's  findings  and\r\n\nrulings on  certain matters;  reverse others either  as being\r\n\nclearly erroneous  or legally incorrect;  and identify  still\r\n\nothers that require the  district court to make findings  and\r\n\nrulings now absent.    We, therefore, vacate in  its entirety\r\n\nthe  judgment  awarding  a  total of  $38,118,940.07  to  the\r\n\nplaintiffs and remand with directions that the district court\r\n\nhold further proceedings and take such further actions as are\r\n\nnecessary to  comply with this  opinion.35  We  summarize our\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n35.  As  a  matter of  consistency,  we  likewise vacate  the\r\ncourt's  other directives  not  incorporated in  its judgment\r\npurporting to afford relief, such as its equitable rescission\r\n\n                            -101-\r\r\n\nspecific dispositions as follows:\r\n\n          (1)  We  reverse  as  being  clearly erroneous  the\r\n\ndistrict court's  finding of fraud  premised upon defendants'\r\n\npromise to cede \"facultative\" reinsurance.\r\n\n          (2)  We   sustain  the  court's  finding  that  the\r\n\ndefendants made misrepresentations in the Placing Information\r\n\nto the effect,  inter alia, that  they would obtain  business\r                                      \r\n\ndirectly from primary insurers.  However, the  claim of fraud\r\n\nbased on  this finding must be given further consideration on\r\n\nremand  in   light  of   our  direction  to   reconsider  the\r\n\ndefendants' defense  based on the statute  of limitations; to\r\n\nrevisit  the  reliance  element  and  deny  recovery  to  any\r\n\nplaintiff  unable  to satisfy  its  burden of  proof  on this\r\n\npoint; and to  reconsider the possible effects  of any notice\r\n\nand knowledge  obtained by any  of the plaintiffs  during the\r\n\nlives of the SANS Treaties and determine whether these defeat\r\n\nor limit the duration of any plaintiffs' continuing rights of\r\n\nrecovery in fraud.\r\n\n          (3)  We  reverse  the district  court's  finding of\r\n\nbreach of  contract based  upon the  supposed non-facultative\r\n\ncharacter of the retroceded reinsurance.  We also reverse the\r\n\ndistrict  court's finding  of breach  of contract  based upon\r\n\nfailure to \"produce\" the  retroceded reinsurance.  We reverse\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nof the SANS  Treaties.   Such orders should  be revisited  on\r\nremand and reissued, modified, or not as the court determines\r\nin light of this opinion and its own findings and rulings.\r\n\n                            -102-\r\r\n\nthe district court's breach of contract  finding based on the\r\n\npromise that Graham Watson would \"underwrite\"  the retroceded\r\n\nreinsurance, except we leave open  for the court to consider,\r\n\non  remand,  whether  the  underwriting might  have  been  so\r\n\nentirely inadequate as to violate  that provision.  We affirm\r\n\nthe district court's finding of breach of contract based upon\r\n\nthe  violation of  Warranty No.  2 in  the slips,  subject to\r\n\nfurther findings on the effect of the  statute of limitations\r\n\nand any other bar to recovery.\r\n\n          (4)  We  direct  the  court to  consider  and  make\r\n\nspecific  findings   and  rulings  as  to   the  statutes  of\r\n\nlimitations defenses and to  find the dates that each  of the\r\n\nrelevant statutes began to run as to each of the plaintiffs.\r\n\n          (5) We  direct the court to  recalculate the proper\r\n\namount  of relief and prejudgment interest  to the extent its\r\n\nother  determinations  on  remand  are  consistent  with  the\r\n\nawarding of relief to any of the plaintiffs.  We have upheld,\r\n\nas a  remedy, the cancellation of any reinsurance infected by\r\n\nfraudulent representations  and leave to the  court on remand\r\n\nthe  determination of any  other theories of  relief that may\r\n\nbecome appropriate.\r\n\n          (6) We reverse the court's allowance of plaintiffs'\r\n\nclaims under Mass. Gen. L.  ch. 93A,   2 insofar as  they are\r\n\nbased on fraud in the inducement.  However, we remand for the\r\n\ndistrict  court's further  consideration  whether  any  other\r\n\n                            -103-\r\r\n\nconduct,  as  mentioned  in  this opinion,  might  support  a\r\n\nfinding of liability under that statute.\r\n\n          Appeal No. 93-2338\r                                        \r\n\n          We  affirm  the   district  court's  dismissal   of\r\n\nplaintiffs' claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\r\n\nOrganizations Act, 18 U.S.C.    1961-1968.\r\n\n          So ordered.
