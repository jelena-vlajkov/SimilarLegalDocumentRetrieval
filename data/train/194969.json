Asserting that \"effective  meaningful\n                    \n\nlegal  research often  requires browsing  through as  many as\n\nthirty different lawbooks  a day,\" and having  been unable to\n\nproceed at such a  pace (at least when the  volumes plaintiff\n\nwished to consult were in the main library rather than in the\n\nsatellite library),  plaintiff filed the present  action.  We\n\nconclude that plaintiff's action was properly dismissed under\n\n28 U.S.C.   1915(d).\n\n          The   deficiencies   plaintiff  described   in  the\n\nsatellite library plus the  limitation to two photocopy cases\n\nper request from the main library  may slow the pace of legal\n\nresearch, but do not rise to the level of an unconstitutional\n\ndenial of access to the courts.  Caldwell v. Miller, 790 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n589, 606 (7th Cir.  1986); Campbell v. Miller, 787  F.2d 217,\n                                             \n\n225-30  (7th  Cir.),  cert.  denied,  479  U.S.  1019  (1986)\n                                   \n\n(prisoner limited to  two books at a  time, for which  he may\n\nwait twenty-four hours to one week to obtain).  Plaintiff has\n\nmisjudged the standard  by which the  constitutional adequacy\n\nof  the  legal  resources  are measured.    The  deficiencies\n\nplaintiff identified may prevent plaintiff from preparing the\n\nhoned brief of a lawyer, but  such is not required from a pro\n\nse, whose filings are  liberally construed.  The deficiencies\n\ncomplained of  would  not prevent  plaintiff from  adequately\n\ncommunicating  with the  courts,  and plaintiff's  conclusory\n\nassertion that  he lost  a case  because of the  deficiencies\n\nadds  nothing.    Nor  was  the  state  required  to  provide\n\nplaintiff with  assistance from  someone trained in  the law.\n\nCepulonis  v. Fair,  732 F.2d  1, 6  (1st Cir.  1984) (inmate\n                  \n\nentitled to  adequate law library or  assistance from persons\n\ntrained in the law, not both).\n\n          Plaintiff also asks this  court to order the warden\n\nof  the Massachusetts  prison  where  plaintiff is  currently\n\nhoused to pay  the postage  for plaintiff's legal  mail.   We\n\ndeny plaintiff's motion.   The Massachusetts warden is not  a\n\nparty to  this action.   Furthermore, while  plaintiff claims\n\nthat he has no funds in his prison account, he has not stated\n\nthat  the   warden  has   refused  to  provide   postage  for\n\nappellant's legal mail.   See Bounds v. Smith, 430  U.S. 817,\n                                             \n\n824-25 (1977) (\"It is indisputable that indigent inmates must\n\nbe  provided at  state expense  with paper  and pen  to draft\n\nlegal  documents  and with  stamps to  mail  them\").   In any\n\nevent, any challenge to the prison's mailing practices should\n\nbe brought in the district court.\n\n          We have considered  all of plaintiff's  allegations\n\nand arguments and find them to be without merit.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -3-\n",
