The State Court Proceedings\r            A.   The State Court Proceedings\r                                            \r\n\n          Reid was  arrested, without a warrant,  on June 21,\r\n\n1986,  and  charged with  three  counts  of felonious  sexual\r\n\n                              2\r\r\n\nassault upon a  six-year-old girl, Misty          (\"Misty\").1\r                                                            \r\n\nHe  was incarcerated  immediately  upon  arrest.   Manchester\r\n\nPolice Sergeant Gary Simmons  testified at the probable cause\r\n\nhearing  ultimately held  on August  22, 1986,  and  Reid was\r\n\nbound over for trial.  Between September 9, 1986 and June 24,\r\n\n1987, with assistance from  stand-by counsel, Reid filed five\r\n\nsuccessful motions to compel  disclosure of exculpatory  evi-\r\n\ndence.  \r\n\n          Reid  represented  himself  at   trial,  personally\r\n\ncross-examining  the State's witnesses, including Misty, with\r\n\nassistance from  stand-by counsel.  After  the jury acquitted\r\n\nReid on one  count, he moved to set  aside his convictions on\r\n\nthe two remaining counts.  \r\n\n          Sometime in  September 1988, in response  to a fur-\r\n\nther  motion  to  disclose exculpatory  evidence,  the  State\r\n\nproduced documents  tending to  undermine the  credibility of\r\n\nMisty, her sister Wendy,  and their mother.  Among  the docu-\r\n\nments were Manchester Police Department reports, dated Decem-\r\n\nber 20, 1985  (\"1985 Report\")  and April 4,  1986 (\"1986  Re-\r\n\nport\"), prepared by Sergeant Simmons, containing questionable\r\n\naccounts of previous sexual  assaults allegedly made  against\r\n\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   1The  arrest was made  pursuant to New  Hampshire Rev. Stat.\r\nAnn.   594:10(II)(b), which provides that \"[a]n arrest by a peace\r\nofficer  without a  warrant on  a charge  of a  felony  is lawful\r\nwhenever: ... The  officer has reasonable ground  to believe that\r\nthe person arrested has  committed a felony.\"  The  New Hampshire\r\ncourts interpret  \"reasonable ground\" as the  substantial equiva-\r\nlent of \"probable cause.\"  See State v. Vachon, 533 A.2d 384, 386\r                                                        \r\n(N.H. 1987).\r\n\n                              3\r\r\n\nMisty by other individuals.2   Reid also was provided  with a\r\n\nNew Hampshire  Department of Children &amp;  Youth Services (\"DC-\r\n\nYS\") file  on Misty  and her  family, which  included reports\r\n\nthat Misty's mother had beaten and bruised Misty and  engaged\r\n\nin sexual intercourse  with her boyfriend in  front of Misty.\r\n\nThese allegations  originated, in part, with  Misty's sister,\r\n\nWendy.   It further revealed  that Misty's mother had charac-\r\n\nterized Wendy's allegations as  lies prompted by Wendy's drug\r\n\nuse and desire to move  in with her boyfriend when Wendy  was\r\n\nonly sixteen years old.   The DCYS file also  described aber-\r\n\nrant  sexual behavior by Misty  herself, at age  six, such as\r\n\nperforming fellatio on another child.3\r\n\n          Reid was released on  bail while the superior court\r\n\nconducted  a \"nonevidentiary  hearing\" on  the motion  to set\r\n\naside  his convictions.  The court  concluded that the police\r\n\nreports  of prior  sexual  assaults  constituted  exculpatory\r\n\nimpeachment evidence  which gave  rise to a  reasonable prob-\r\n\nability that  the outcome  of Reid's  trial  would have  been\r\n\ndifferent had the evidence been disclosed to the trial court,\r\n\nsince it directly  undermined the testimony of Misty  and her\r\n\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   2On  their face,  the  reports do  not  indicate that  Misty\r\nfalsely accused anyone.  The 1985 report indicates that Misty had\r\nbeen sexually  abused by a person  or persons unknown.   The 1986\r\nreport states that Misty  denied allegations made by a  neighbor,\r                                          \r\nwho  complained  that Misty  had been  sexually  abused by  a man\r\nreferred to simply as \"George.\" \r\n\n   3It  is not clear whether the DCYS file was before the state\r\ncourt. \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nmother.   Under the New Hampshire Rape Shield Law, Rev. Stat.\r\n\nAnn.   632-A:6, \"a defendant must be afforded the opportunity\r\n\nto show,  by specific incidents  of sexual conduct,  that the\r\n\nprosecutrix  has the  experience  and ability  to contrive  a\r\n\nstatutory rape  charge against  him.\"   State v.  Howard, 121\r                                                                    \r\n\nN.H. 53, 61 (1981).   On October 5, 1988, the  superior court\r\n\nset the  two remaining  convictions aside  and ordered a  new\r\n\ntrial.   In  December 1988,  all  charges against  Reid  were\r\n\ndropped. \r\n\nB.   The Federal District Court Proceedings\r            B.   The Federal District Court Proceedings\r                                                       \r\n\n     (i)  The Original Complaint\r                 (i)  The Original Complaint\r                                            \r\n\n          The  original  civil  rights complaint  in  federal\r\n\ndistrict court alleged that between the date of arrest,  June\r\n\n1986, and  the date his  convictions were set  aside, October\r\n\n1988, prosecutors  Wageling and  McDonough caused Reid  to be\r\n\ndeprived of  his liberty without probable  cause in violation\r\n\nof the Fourth Amendment.  It alleged that the prosecutors, by\r\n\nwithholding the exculpatory  evidence, violated Reid's rights\r\n\nto due process, a  fair trial, equal protection of  the laws,\r\n\nand to confront  and obtain witnesses.  Reid  further alleged\r\n\nthat  he  was arrested  by  Manchester  Police Sergeant  Gary\r\n\nSimmons  on  the basis  of  unreliable  information and  that\r\n\nSimmons  continuously  withheld exculpatory  evidence between\r\n\nJune 1986 and October 1988.  Finally, he alleged that Richard\r\n\nRenfro, Esquire,  deprived Reid of his  Sixth Amendment right\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nto the effective assistance of counsel  by failing to prepare\r\n\nthe case adequately for trial.  \r\n\n          On June 19, 1989,  a United States magistrate judge\r\n\nrecommended  that all but one  claim be dismissed.4   The re-\r\n\nport and recommendation noted  that prosecutors Wageling  and\r\n\nMcDonough were  absolutely immune  from suit under  Imbler v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nPachtman,  424 U.S. 409 (1976),  and that Reid  had failed to\r                    \r\n\nallege the requisite state action to sustain  a claim against\r\n\ndefense counsel  Renfro under Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n312, 320-21 (1981).  \r\n\n     (ii) The First Amended Complaint\r                 (ii) The First Amended Complaint\r                                                 \r\n\n          Reid filed  an amended  pro se complaint,  alleging\r                                                    \r\n\nfederal and state civil rights violations and adding Manches-\r\n\nter Police  defendants Gilman,  Ahern and  Paul.   It alleged\r\n\nthat  the police  defendants  arrested Reid  on the  basis of\r\n\nunreliable information, in violation of the Fourth Amendment,\r\n\nand deliberately  suppressed  exculpatory evidence  from  the\r\n\ntime of his arrest until after his trial, in violation of his\r\n\nright to equal protection,  the effective assistance of coun-\r\n\nsel, a fair trial, due process, and the right to confront and\r\n\nobtain witnesses.   The first amended  complaint also alleged\r\n\nthat prosecutors Wageling and McDonough  had instructed their\r\n\ncodefendants  in the  present  civil rights  action, and  the\r\n\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   4The magistrate judge recommended  that Reid be permitted to\r\nsubmit  further  documentation  on  the  claim  against  Sergeant\r\nSimmons.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nwitnesses at Reid's criminal trial, not to mention the police\r\n\nreports on prior sexual assault complaints relating to Misty,\r\n\nthereby prompting  these codefendants to  respond falsely  to\r\n\ninquiries  concerning the  withheld evidence both  before and\r\n\nduring the  criminal trial.   See  Hilliard v.  Williams, 465\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 1212, 1215  (6th Cir.  1972), rev'd, 540  F.2d 220,  221\r                                                    \r\n\n(6th Cir. 1976)  (per curiam).   The first amended  complaint\r\n\nreiterated  Reid's allegation  that the  prosecutors deliber-\r\n\nately  withheld the exculpatory  evidence before, during, and\r\n\nfor fourteen months after Reid's criminal trial, resulting in\r\n\nhis unlawful  conviction and  imprisonment.  Finally,  it al-\r\n\nleged that  the defendant  officers and prosecutors  had con-\r\n\nspired to deprive Reid of his constitutional rights.  \r\n\n          The magistrate  judge issued  a Further  Report and\r\n\nRecommendation on February 6,  1990, which concluded that the\r\n\nfirst amended complaint stated an actionable Fourth Amendment\r\n\nclaim for false arrest against the police defendants and that\r\n\nReid's motion to add police defendants Gilman, Ahern and Paul\r\n\nshould  be  allowed.   Citing Imbler,  424  U.S. at  430, the\r                                                \r\n\nmagistrate  judge  concluded,  nonetheless,  that  the claims\r\n\nagainst  prosecutors Wageling  and McDonough  were barred  by\r\n\nabsolute prosecutorial immunity.  Finally,  the report recom-\r\n\nmended that the claim against Attorney Renfro be dismissed. \r\n\n          On March  22, 1991, the district  court adopted the\r\n\nFurther  Report  and  Recommendation, effectively  dismissing\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nprosecutors  Wageling  and  McDonough,  and  defense  counsel\r\n\nRenfro, as defendants.5\r\n\n     (iii)  The Third Amended Complaint6\r                                                    \r                 (iii)  The Third Amended Complaint6\r                                                    \r\n\n          On June 10, 1992, following further discovery, Reid\r\n\nrequested leave  to file  the third amended  complaint, reas-\r\n\nserting all claims against the prosecutors, adding a conspir-\r\n\nacy claim  against Renfro,  and naming additional  police and\r\n\nprosecutor defendants.   The third amended complaint  further\r\n\nparticularized  the  claims  against the  police  defendants,\r\n\nasserting that their failure to disclose exculpatory evidence\r\n\nconstituted  actionable  malicious  prosecution and  violated\r\n\nReid's  constitutional  rights.   In  contrast  to the  first\r\n\namended complaint, which indicated  that the prosecutors knew\r\n\nabout the exculpatory evidence  but instructed the police and\r\n\nothers to conceal it,  Reid's third amended complaint, liber-\r\n\nally  construed,  see Estelle  v.  Gamble, 429  U.S.  97, 106\r                                                     \r\n\n(1976), asserted  that the police defendants  knew the police\r                                                                         \r\n\nreports and  the DCYS file  existed, but concealed  them from\r                                                                         \r\n\nthe prosecutors for almost  two years, between June  1986 and\r                                                 \r\n\nAugust  1988.   Thus,  the third  amended complaint  restated\r\n\nReid's previous allegations against the police defendants and\r\n\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   5Reid  and the  police  defendants objected  to the  Further\r\nReport  and Recommendation.    Although Reid  did  not object  to\r\ndismissal of the claim  against Renfro, he reserved the  right to\r\namend it following discovery.\r\n\n   6A second  amended complaint, naming a  former New Hampshire\r\ngovernor as a defendant, was dismissed by the district court.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\npleaded distinct claims  for negligence, false arrest,  mali-\r\n\ncious  prosecution, wrongful withholding  of exculpatory evi-\r\n\ndence, and conspiracy.\r\n\n          As for  the prosecutors  and  Attorney Renfro,  the\r\n\nthird amended complaint alleged, in the alternative, that the\r\n\nprosecutors knew  of the  exculpatory evidence but  failed to\r\n\ndisclose the  information to Renfro, or  that the prosecutors\r                                                   \r\n\ndisclosed the exculpatory information to  Renfro but enlisted\r\n\nhim in  their conspiracy to conceal  the exculpatory informa-\r\n\ntion  from Reid.   We  turn to the  various claims  raised on\r\n\nappeal. \r\n\n                              II\r                                          II\r\n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\nA.   The Claims Against the Prosecutors\r            A.   The Claims Against the Prosecutors\r                                                   \r\n\n          Reid contends  that  the district  court  erred  in\r\n\ndismissing  his  claims  against  prosecutors   Wageling  and\r\n\nMcDonough.  He argues  that Imbler \"absolute immunity\" should\r                                              \r\n\nnot extend to claims  for withholding exculpatory evidence in\r\n\ndirect violation of  trial court orders, where it  is alleged\r\n\nthat the prosecutors repeatedly misled the trial court itself\r\n\nthroughout the  criminal proceedings.   Reid claims  that the\r\n\ndisclosure orders issued by the trial court displaced whatev-\r\n\ner discretion the prosecutors may have had concerning disclo-\r\n\nsure of exculpatory  evidence, consequently their  failure to\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\ndisclose was not a prosecutorial function  at all, but merely\r\n\nministerial.    Finally,  he  contends  that the  prosecutors\r\n\nrepeatedly lied to the trial court about the existence of the\r\n\nexculpatory evidence, whereas in Imbler the prosecutor volun-\r                                                   \r\n\ntarily disclosed  the evidence shortly after  learning of it.\r\n\n          The district court dismissed the claims against the\r\n\nprosecutors  as  frivolous under  28  U.S.C.    1915(d).   We\r\n\nreview only for abuse of discretion, see Watson v. Caton, 984\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 537, 539 (1st Cir. 1993), and find none.7 \r\n\n          First, Reid  alleged no facts  suggesting that  the\r\n\nprosecutors had anything  to do  with the arrest.   The  com-\r\n\nplaint therefore  failed to state an  actionable false arrest\r\n\nclaim.8 \r\n\n          Second, under  Imbler \"it is 'now  [a] well-settled\r                                           \r\n\nrule  that a prosecutor cannot be  held personally liable for\r\n\nthe  knowing suppression of exculpatory information.'\" Robin-\r                                                                         \r\n\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   7Although the  magistrate judge recommended that  the claims\r\nagainst the prosecutors  be dismissed for  \"fail[ing] to state  a\r\ncause of  action\"    language strongly suggesting a Rule 12(b)(6)\r\ndismissal    Reid was given notice of the deficiencies and a full\r\nopportunity to amend  the complaint.   Thus,  dismissal under  28\r\nU.S.C.   1915(d) was proper.   See Purvis v. Ponte, 929 F.2d 822,\r                                                            \r\n826-27 (1st Cir. 1991).  \r\n\n   8As New Hampshire  recognizes the torts of  false arrest and\r\nmalicious  prosecution, see Stock  v. Byers, 424  A.2d 1122, 1123\r                                                     \r\n(N.H. 1980),  those claims should have been  analyzed under state\r\nlaw,  rather than   1983.  Given an adequate state-law remedy for\r\na procedural due process violation, no   1983 claim lies.  Perez-\r                                                                           \r\nRuiz v.

The\r\n\nImbler  rule has  been  applied where  prosecutors failed  to\r                  \r\n\ndisclose  exculpatory evidence specifically  requested by the\r\n\ndefense, see Jones v. Shankland, 800 F.2d 77, 78-80 (6th Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1048 (1987), and where prosecu-\r                               \r\n\ntors misled the trial court in order to conceal their failure\r\n\nto disclose exculpatory evidence, see Wilkinson v. Ellis, 484\r                                                                    \r\n\nF. Supp. 1072, 1082 (E.D. Pa. 1980). \r\n\n          Thus, we think the trial court discovery orders did\r\n\nnot displace Imbler immunity.  In the first place, it  is in-\r                               \r\n\naccurate  to assert, as Reid does, that there was no prosecu-\r\n\ntorial discretion  left to  be exercised respecting  the dis-\r\n\nclosure of  this evidence.   On the contrary,  the disclosure\r\n\norders were issued  in response to  motions for \"any  'excul-\r\n\npatory' evidence which could assist [Reid] in the preparation\r\n\nand presentation of his defense,\" broad language indicating a\r\n\ngeneral request  for Brady material.   The orders accordingly\r                                      \r\n\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   9As  New  Hampshire law  apparently  affords  no remedy  for\r\nwithholding exculpatory evidence, this claim is subject to   1983\r\nanalysis.   See  also Belcher  v. Paine,  612 A.2d  1318, 1322-23\r                                                 \r\n(N.H. 1992)  (applying Imbler doctrine  to malicious  prosecution\r                                       \r\nclaim under state law.)\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nleft the  prosecutors with something more  than a ministerial\r\n\nfunction to perform.  The prosecutors were required to deter-\r\n\nmine what evidence in  their possession was \"exculpatory\" and\r\n\nsubject to  disclosure.10  Cf.   Buckley v. Fitzsimmons,     \r                                                                         \r\n\nU.S.       ,  113 S.

Imbler expressly recognized that requiring prosecutors\r                         \r\n\nto defend     in section 1983 actions    decisions concerning\r\n\nthe  \"materiality of  evidence  not revealed  to the  defense\r\n\ncould impose unique and intolerable burdens upon a prosecutor\r\n\nresponsible annually for hundreds of indictments and trials.\"\r\n\nImbler, 424 U.S. at 425-26.  The view expressed in the Imbler\r                                                                         \r\n\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   10We recognize that N.H.  Rev. Stat. Ann.   631-A:6,  on its\r\nface,  bans evidence of prior sexual activity by a prosecutrix in\r\na  rape case:    \"Prior consensual  sexual  activity between  the\r\nvictim and any person other than the actor shall  not be admitted\r\ninto  evidence in any prosecution  under this chapter.\"  However,\r\nthe New Hampshire Supreme Court has read a constitutional limita-\r\ntion into this statutory  ban in statutory rape  cases, so as  to\r\npreserve  the statute  from  infirmity to  constitutional attack.\r\nHoward, 121 N.H. at 61 (state constitution requires that the jury\r                \r\nbe informed  of prior sexual  experience of child  prosecutrix in\r\nstatutory rape case,  since jury otherwise  could infer that  the\r\nprosecutrix must have gained her knowledge of sexual anatomy only\r\nthrough the alleged sexual  assault).  Whether and when  to admit\r\nsuch evidence  rests within  the discretion  of the trial  court.\r\nState v. Cox, 575 A.2d 1320, 1322-23 (N.H. 1990) (upholding trial\r                      \r\ncourt's exercise  of  discretion admitting  Howard-type  evidence\r                                                            \r\nonly during  cross-examination  of  prosecutrix).    Thus,  these\r\nprosecutors  retained  some discretion,  at least,  in evaluating\r                                     \r\nwhether  the  putative  prior attacks  against  Misty constituted\r\nBrady evidence.  We do not suggest, of  course, that the prosecu-\r               \r\ntors were free to disregard the state court disclosure order, nor\r\nthat  there were no alternative means of avoiding a violation, as\r\nby submitting the evidence for in camera review.\r                                                  \r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\ndissent    that absolute  immunity should attach only  if the\r\n\nprosecutor  has disclosed all  facts which cast  doubt on the\r\n\nState's evidence    was rejected  by the Imbler Court because\r                                                           \r\n\nsuch a  requirement  would  interfere  \"with  the  legitimate\r                                                                         \r\n\nexercise of prosecutorial  discretion.\"  Id. at  432.

The Claims Against the Police Officers\r                                                       \r\n\n          After  the false  arrest  claims  were  allowed  to\r\n\nproceed, the  police defendants  contended that  the district\r\n\ncourt had dismissed, as frivolous,  the claim that the police\r\n\ndeprived Reid  of due  process  of law  and a  fair trial  by\r\n\nconcealing exculpatory evidence.  Unable to obtain clarifica-\r\n\ntion  of the  district  court dismissal  order, Reid  pursued\r\n\nfurther  discovery in  an  attempt to  establish each  police\r\n\ndefendant's awareness  of the exculpatory evidence and wheth-\r\n\ner,  and when, the officers  had disclosed what  they knew to\r\n\none  another and  to  the prosecutors.    The district  court\r\n\nultimately permitted the  third amended complaint,  including\r\n\nthe false  arrest claims  and the  concealment claims,  to be\r\n\nfiled against the police defendants.  \r\n\n     (i)  The Third Amended Complaint\r                 (i)  The Third Amended Complaint\r                                                 \r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n          On February 14, 1992, the  magistrate judge ordered\r\n\nthe  police defendants to  respond to  Reid's interrogatories\r\n\nand requests for production  of documents.  On June  10, Reid\r\n\nfiled a  motion to  compel further responses  to interrogato-\r\n\nries, followed  by motions to join  additional defendants and\r\n\nfor permission to file  the third amended complaint alleging,\r\n\ninter  alia, that  the police  defendants conspired  with the\r                       \r\n\nprosecutors to conceal the  exculpatory evidence.  There fol-\r\n\nlowed, in July 1992, another motion to compel production.  \r\n\n          Prior to any disposition  of Reid's June 10 motions\r\n\nto  compel responses to interrogatories and for leave to file\r\n\nthe third amended complaint,  the police defendants moved for\r\n\nsummary judgment on qualified immunity grounds based on their\r\n\ncontention that other evidence in their possession was suffi-\r\n\ncient  to establish  probable  cause for  Reid's arrest  even\r\n\nassuming  they had  withheld  the exculpatory  evidence.   In\r\n\naddition, Sergeant  Simmons  submitted an  affidavit  denying\r\n\nthat  he had withheld police  reports relating to  Misty.  On\r\n\nAugust 27, 1992,  Reid requested further  time to respond  to\r\n\nthe police  defendants' motion for summary  judgment, because\r\n\nhe was unable to do so  until the district court ruled on his\r\n\ndiscovery requests.14 \r\n\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   14Although Sergeant Simmons made reference to earlier police\r\nreports relating to Misty, he did not mention the DCYS file.  Nor\r\nis  it  clear whether  the police  defendants  were privy  to its\r\ncontents prior to Reid's arrest or conviction.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\n          In November, 1992,  the case  was transferred  from\r\n\nRhode Island to  New Hampshire and reassigned to  a different\r\n\ndistrict judge.   On  December 14,  the newly  assigned judge\r\n\nallowed Reid until January 11, 1993, to respond to the police\r\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment.  At  the same  time,\r\n\nthe court  directed that  Reid's motions to  compel discovery\r\n\nand to  substitute the third amended  complaint be considered\r\n\n\"withdrawn\"  from  the  docket,  without prejudice  to  their\r\n\nrenewal  by January 4, 1993.  Reid renewed each motion within\r\n\nthe deadline and again  sought additional time to  respond to\r\n\nthe motion for summary judgment.\r\n\n          On  January 22,  1993, the  district  court allowed\r\n\nReid  seven  days to  respond in  writing  to the  motion for\r\n\nsummary judgment.  The court  denied Reid's motion to substi-\r\n\ntute  the third  amended  complaint insofar  as it  would add\r\n\nclaims  against prosecutors Wageling  and McDonough for mali-\r\n\ncious  prosecution, denial of  due process  of law  and false\r\n\nimprisonment caused by the failure to disclose the exculpato-\r\n\nry evidence, and against  Attorney Renfro for conspiring with\r\n\nthe  prosecutors to  conceal  the  exculpatory evidence  from\r\n\nReid.    At the  same time,  the  court allowed  an amendment\r\n\nadding  a  separate malicious  prosecution claim  against all\r\n\npolice  defendants and  restating the  claim that  the police\r\n\ndefendants had violated Reid's constitutional rights by  con-\r\n\ntinuously  withholding the exculpatory evidence.  Lastly, the\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\ndistrict  court  rejected  Reid's  motion to  compel  further\r\n\ndiscovery under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f), on the ground that the\r\n\ndiscovery sought was not  substantially related to the police\r\n\ndefendants' qualified immunity claims.  \r\n\n          On  February 5,  1993, the  district  court granted\r\n\nsummary judgment for all police defendants.  Relying primari-\r\n\nly on  reports of  the police investigation  preceding Reid's\r\n\narrest, the  court reasoned  that the police  defendants were\r\n\nentitled to qualified immunity because an objectively reason-\r\n\nable police officer, based on all the evidence, including the\r\n\nexculpatory  information withheld until August of 1988, none-\r\n\ntheless could have believed that  there was probable cause to\r\n\narrest Reid for sexually  assaulting Misty, even assuming the\r\n\npolice  defendants  concealed  the   exculpatory  evidence.15\r\n\nThe district court did  not mention the malicious prosecution\r\n\nclaims  relating to the alleged  failure of the police defen-\r\n\ndants  to disclose  the  exculpatory evidence,  but concluded\r\n\nthat  \"when probable  cause exists notwithstanding  the exis-\r\n\ntence  of  some exculpatory  evidence,  no  violation of  the\r\n\nFourth Amendment occurs and  the shield of qualified immunity\r                                                                         \r\n\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   15The district  court did not have  the exculpatory evidence\r\nwhen it ruled on  either the motion  for summary judgment or  the\r\nmotion for reconsideration.  Those materials were in the district\r\ncourt, however, for a  single day    February 10    after summary\r                                                                   \r\njudgment  had been entered against Reid and before the motion for\r                                                            \r\nreconsideration was filed.  Nor did the court have the opportuni-\r\nty  to consider Reid's pro se memorandum in opposition to summary\r\njudgment before granting summary  judgment against him, though it\r\ndid so prior to ruling on the motion for reconsideration.  \r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nremains viable.\"  (emphasis added).   Final judgment  was en-\r\n\ntered dismissing all claims  against the police defendants on\r\n\nFebruary 8. \r\n\n          On February 10,  the district court  clerk received\r\n\nand  docketed  Reid's timely  opposition  to  the motion  for\r                                        \r\n\nsummary  judgment, together  with  his supporting  affidavit,\r\n\nexhibits,  memorandum, and  statement of  contested and  unc-\r\n\nontested  facts.16   The  supporting  materials  included the\r\n\n1985 and 1986 police reports, which recorded prior complaints\r\n\nof  sexual assaults against Misty, as well as portions of the\r\n\nDCYS reports describing relevant family history.  \r\n\n          The DCYS  reports described how Misty  and her sis-\r\n\nter,  Wendy, had been physically abused by their mother.  The\r\n\nallegations were made by  Wendy, and by a former  roommate of\r                                           \r\n\nMisty's  mother.   The  reports related  that Misty's  mother\r\n\nengaged  in  sexual intercourse  in  Misty's  presence.   The\r\n\nformer roommate  described how she had  found Misty fellating\r\n\nher four-year-old  son on  April 17,  1985.   Misty's  mother\r\n\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   16Weekends, legal holidays,  and January 22     the date  of\r\nthe denial of the motion to  compel    should have been  excluded\r\nfrom the  running of the  seven-day filing  period.

Rule  6(e) further  required that  three days  be\r\nadded to the prescribed response period since the court order had\r\nbeen mailed to Reid.   Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(e).   Thus, he had until\r\nFebruary 5,  1993, to respond.  Reid  seasonably filed opposition\r\nto  the motion  for summary  judgment by  depositing it  with the\r\nprison warden  on February 5.  See Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266,\r                                                            \r\n275 (1988) (holding that filing periods  for prisoners are deter-\r\nmined when  submitted to prison  warden) (analogous  FRAP 4  con-\r\ntext); Oliver v.

Finally, the DCYS reports reflect that during\r\n\n1985    the year  before Reid's arrest    Misty's  mother was\r\n\nunder investigation for child abuse and neglect.  \r\n\n          Reid  contended  that  these materials  established\r\n\nthat both Misty and  her mother were unreliable and  that the\r\n\nmother had an ulterior motive for fabricating charges against\r\n\nReid since she had  been the subject of a  DCYS investigation\r\n\nfor abuse and neglect  based on Wendy's allegations  that the\r\n\nmother repeatedly had beaten her and Misty.17  \r\n\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   17Reid contended further that  the police defendants had not\r\nestablished their  entitlement to  summary judgment on  his claim\r\nthat they  withheld the exculpatory evidence.

Prior  to the\r\n\nRule 56(f) motion, moreover, the magistrate judge had ordered\r\n\nthe police defendants to respond to interrogatories previous-\r\n\nly  filed by Reid.  The police defendants have never complied\r\n\nwith  the order  to respond  to these  interrogatories.   The\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nunanswered interrogatories directly concern the critical DCYS\r\n\nreports  on Misty, Wendy and their mother, and when the vari-\r\n\nous police defendants became aware of these reports. \r\n\n          The  requested  discovery was  essential  to Reid's\r\n\nclaims against  the police  defendants.  When  the individual\r\n\npolice  defendants learned  of  the  exculpatory evidence  is\r\n\nrelevant to (1) whether  the individual defendants reasonably\r\n\ncould have believed there was  probable cause to arrest  Reid\r\n\n(false  arrest  claim) and  (2)  whether  they initiated  the\r\n\ncriminal prosecution knowing that probable cause was  lacking\r\n\n(malicious prosecution claim).  When the exculpatory evidence\r\n\nwas transmitted to the prosecutors is relevant to determining\r\n\n(3) whether  the individual defendants attempted  to withhold\r\n\nBrady  material from  the prosecutors  (section 1983  claim).\r                 \r\n\nThe unanswered interrogatories  were pertinent  to all  these\r\n\nmatters.    As the  discovery sought  is  such that  it could\r\n\narguably generate  a trialworthy  issue of material  fact, we\r\n\nmust determine  whether Reid  complied with the  other stric-\r\n\ntures of Rule 56(f).\r\n\n          Given the  direct police involvement in  the bitter\r\n\ndispute  between Wendy  and her  mother, and  the two  police\r\n\nreports relating prior  sexual abuse of  Misty, it cannot  be\r\n\nconsidered  implausible  in the  least  that  the police  had\r\n\naccess to the exculpatory information prior to Reid's arrest.\r                  \r\n\nThe  requested  information was  within  the  control of  the\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\npolice defendants, a factor which weighs  heavily in favor of\r\n\nrelief under Rule  56(f).

Furthermore,\r\n\nReid  not only sought discovery  in a timely  manner, but ob-\r\n\ntained  a  court order  requiring  the  police defendants  to\r\n\nrespond to his interrogatories.   See Mattoon, 980 F.2d  at 7\r                                                         \r\n\n(failure of movant to pursue discovery with diligence permits\r\n\ndenial  of Rule 56(f) motion).

The State Court Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid was arrested, without a warrant, on June 21, 1986, and charged with three counts of felonious sexual assault upon a six-year-old girl, Misty ____ (\"Misty\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  He was incarcerated immediately upon arrest.  Manchester Police Sergeant Gary Simmons testified at the probable cause hearing ultimately held on August 22, 1986, and Reid was bound over for trial.  Between September 9, 1986 and June 24, 1987, with assistance from stand-by counsel, Reid filed five successful motions to compel disclosure of exculpatory evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid represented himself at trial, personally cross-examining the State's witnesses, including Misty, with assistance from stand-by counsel.  After the jury acquitted Reid on one count, he moved to set aside his convictions on the two remaining counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime in September 1988, in response to a further motion to disclose exculpatory evidence, the State produced documents tending to undermine the credibility of Misty, her sister Wendy, and their mother.  Among the documents were Manchester Police Department reports, dated December 20, 1985 (\"1985 Report\") and April 4, 1986 (\"1986 Report\"), prepared by Sergeant Simmons, containing questionable accounts of previous sexual assaults allegedly made against Misty by other individuals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Reid also was provided with a New Hampshire Department of Children &amp; Youth Services (\"DCYS\") file on Misty and her family, which included reports that Misty's mother had beaten and bruised Misty and engaged in sexual intercourse with her boyfriend in front of Misty.  These allegations originated, in part, with Misty's sister, Wendy.  It further revealed that Misty's mother had characterized Wendy's allegations as lies prompted by Wendy's drug use and desire to move in with her boyfriend when Wendy was only sixteen years old.  The DCYS file also described aberrant sexual behavior by Misty herself, at age six, such as performing fellatio on another child.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid was released on bail while the superior court conducted a \"nonevidentiary hearing\" on the motion to set aside his convictions.  The court concluded that the police reports of prior sexual assaults constituted exculpatory impeachment evidence which gave rise to a reasonable probability that the outcome of Reid's trial would have been different had the evidence been disclosed to the trial court, since it directly undermined the testimony of Misty and her mother.  Under the New Hampshire Rape Shield Law, Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 632-A:6, \"a defendant must be afforded the opportunity to show, by specific incidents of sexual conduct, that the prosecutrix has the experience and ability to contrive a statutory rape charge against him.\"  State v. Howard, 121 N.H. 53, 61, 426 A.2d 457 (1981).  On October 5, 1988, the superior court set the two remaining convictions aside and ordered a new trial.  In December 1988, all charges against Reid were dropped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Federal District Court Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) The Original Complaint</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original civil rights complaint in federal district court alleged that between the date of arrest, June 1986, and the date his convictions were set aside, October 1988, prosecutors Wageling and McDonough caused Reid to be deprived of his liberty without probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  It alleged that the prosecutors, by withholding the exculpatory evidence, violated Reid's rights to due process, a fair trial, equal protection of the laws, and to confront and obtain witnesses.  Reid further alleged that he was arrested by Manchester Police Sergeant Gary Simmons on the basis of unreliable information and that Simmons continuously withheld exculpatory evidence between June 1986 and October 1988.  Finally, he alleged that Richard Renfro, Esquire, deprived Reid of his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel by failing to prepare the case adequately for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 19, 1989, a United States magistrate judge recommended that all but one claim be dismissed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The report and recommendation noted that prosecutors Wageling and McDonough were absolutely immune from suit under Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976), and that Reid had failed to allege the requisite state action to sustain a claim against defense counsel Renfro under Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 320-21, 102 S.Ct. 445, 450-51, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) The First Amended Complaint</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid filed an amended pro se complaint, alleging federal and state civil rights violations and adding Manchester Police defendants Gilman, Ahern and Paul.  It alleged that the police defendants arrested Reid on the basis of unreliable information, in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and deliberately suppressed exculpatory evidence from the time of his arrest until after his trial, in violation of his right to equal protection, the effective assistance of counsel, a fair trial, due process, and the right to confront and obtain witnesses.  The first amended complaint also alleged that prosecutors Wageling and McDonough had instructed their codefendants in the present civil rights action, and the witnesses at Reid's criminal trial, not to mention the police reports on prior sexual assault complaints relating to Misty, thereby prompting these codefendants to respond falsely to inquiries concerning the withheld evidence both before and during the criminal trial.  See Hilliard v. Williams, 465 F.2d 1212, 1215 (6th Cir.1972), rev'd, 540 F.2d 220, 221 (6th Cir.1976) (per curiam).  The first amended complaint reiterated Reid's allegation that the prosecutors deliberately withheld the exculpatory evidence before, during, and for fourteen months after Reid's criminal trial, resulting in his unlawful conviction and imprisonment.  Finally, it alleged that the defendant officers and prosecutors had conspired to deprive Reid of his constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge issued a Further Report and Recommendation on February 6, 1990, which concluded that the first amended complaint stated an actionable Fourth Amendment claim for false arrest against the police defendants and that Reid's motion to add police defendants Gilman, Ahern and Paul should be allowed.  Citing Imbler, 424 U.S. at 430, 96 S.Ct. at 994, the magistrate judge concluded, nonetheless, that the claims against prosecutors Wageling and McDonough were barred by absolute prosecutorial immunity.  Finally, the report recommended that the claim against Attorney Renfro be dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 22, 1991, the district court adopted the Further Report and Recommendation, effectively dismissing prosecutors Wageling and McDonough, and defense counsel Renfro, as defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iii) The Third Amended Complaint<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 10, 1992, following further discovery, Reid requested leave to file the third amended complaint, reasserting all claims against the prosecutors, adding a conspiracy claim against Renfro, and naming additional police and prosecutor defendants.  The third amended complaint further particularized the claims against the police defendants, asserting that their failure to disclose exculpatory evidence constituted actionable malicious prosecution and violated Reid's constitutional rights.  In contrast to the first amended complaint, which indicated that the prosecutors knew about the exculpatory evidence but instructed the police and others to conceal it, Reid's third amended complaint, liberally construed, see Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 292, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), asserted that the police defendants knew the police reports and the DCYS file existed, but concealed them from the prosecutors for almost two years, between June 1986 and August 1988.  Thus, the third amended complaint restated Reid's previous allegations against the police defendants and pleaded distinct claims for negligence, false arrest, malicious prosecution, wrongful withholding of exculpatory evidence, and conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the prosecutors and Attorney Renfro, the third amended complaint alleged, in the alternative, that the prosecutors knew of the exculpatory evidence but failed to disclose the information to Renfro, or that the prosecutors disclosed the exculpatory information to Renfro but enlisted him in their conspiracy to conceal the exculpatory information from Reid.  We turn to the various claims raised on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. The Claims Against the Prosecutors</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid contends that the district court erred in dismissing his claims against prosecutors Wageling and McDonough.  He argues that Imbler \"absolute immunity\" should not extend to claims for withholding exculpatory evidence in direct violation of trial court orders, where it is alleged that the prosecutors repeatedly misled the trial court itself throughout the criminal proceedings.  Reid claims that the disclosure orders issued by the trial court displaced whatever discretion the prosecutors may have had concerning disclosure of exculpatory evidence, consequently their failure to disclose was not a prosecutorial function at all, but merely ministerial.  Finally, he contends that the prosecutors repeatedly lied to the trial court about the existence of the exculpatory evidence, whereas in Imbler the prosecutor voluntarily disclosed the evidence shortly after learning of it.  The district court dismissed the claims against the prosecutors as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1915(d).  We review only for abuse of discretion, see Watson v. Caton, 984 F.2d 537, 539 (1st Cir.1993), and find none.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Reid alleged no facts suggesting that the prosecutors had anything to do with the arrest.  The complaint therefore failed to state an actionable false arrest claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, under Imbler \"it is 'now [a] well-settled rule that a prosecutor cannot be held personally liable for the knowing suppression of exculpatory information.' \"  Robinson v. Volkswagenwerk AG, 940 F.2d 1369, 1372-73 (10th Cir.1991) (citation omitted), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1091, 112 S.Ct. 1160, 117 L.Ed.2d 408 (1992);  Myers v. Morris, 810 F.2d 1437, 1446 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 828 (1987).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  See Campbell v. Maine, 787 F.2d 776, 777 (1st Cir.1986) (per curiam);  Hilliard v. Williams, 540 F.2d 220, 221-22 (6th Cir.1976) (per curiam).  The Imbler rule has been applied where prosecutors failed to disclose exculpatory evidence specifically requested by the defense, see Jones v. Shankland, 800 F.2d 77, 78-80 (6th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1048, 107 S.Ct. 2177, 95 L.Ed.2d 834 (1987), and where prosecutors misled the trial court in order to conceal their failure to disclose exculpatory evidence, see Wilkinson v. Ellis, 484 F.Supp. 1072, 1082 (E.D.Pa.1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we think the trial court discovery orders did not displace Imbler immunity.  In the first place, it is inaccurate to assert, as Reid does, that there was no prosecutorial discretion left to be exercised respecting the disclosure of this evidence.  On the contrary, the disclosure orders were issued in response to motions for \"any 'exculpatory' evidence which could assist [Reid] in the preparation and presentation of his defense,\" broad language indicating a general request for Brady material.  The orders accordingly left the prosecutors with something more than a ministerial function to perform.  The prosecutors were required to determine what evidence in their possession was \"exculpatory\" and subject to disclosure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Cf. Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2606, 2616, 125 L.Ed.2d 209 (1993) (when prosecutor evaluates evidence and interviews witnesses in preparation for trial, he functions within the scope of absolute immunity).  Imbler expressly recognized that requiring prosecutors to defend--in section 1983 actions--decisions concerning the \"materiality of evidence not revealed to the defense could impose unique and intolerable burdens upon a prosecutor responsible annually for hundreds of indictments and trials.\"  Imbler, 424 U.S. at 425-26, 96 S.Ct. at 993.   The view expressed in the Imbler dissent--that absolute immunity should attach only if the prosecutor has disclosed all facts which cast doubt on the State's evidence--was rejected by the Imbler Court because such a requirement would interfere \"with the legitimate exercise of prosecutorial discretion.\"  Id. at 432, 96 S.Ct. at 996.  Imbler thus implicitly acknowledged that prosecutors retain discretion to determine what evidence is to be disclosed under Brady and that absolute immunity attaches to their exercise of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The further allegation that these prosecutors repeatedly misled the trial court in order to conceal their alleged misconduct does not defeat absolute immunity.  In Burns v. Reed, 500 U.S. 478, 489-90, 111 S.Ct. 1934, 1941, 114 L.Ed.2d 547 (1991), the Court sustained absolute prosecutorial immunity for \"making false or defamatory statements in judicial proceedings (at least so long as the statements were related to the proceeding), and also for eliciting false and defamatory testimony from witnesses.\"  Imbler stated that it is \" 'better to leave unredressed the wrongs done by dishonest officers than to subject those who try to do their duty to the constant dread of retaliation.' \"   See Imbler, 424 U.S. at 428, 96 S.Ct. at 994 (quoting Gregoire v. Biddle, 177 F.2d 579, 581 (2nd Cir.1949), cert. denied, 339 U.S. 949, 70 S.Ct. 803, 94 L.Ed. 1363 (1950)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor was absolute immunity forfeited because the prosecutors continued to withhold the exculpatory evidence long after Reid's conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Imbler specifically noted that absolute prosecutorial immunity is an essential guarantee that reviewing courts focus exclusively on the fairness of the underlying trial, not upon any collateral consequences a reversal might portend for the prosecutor.  Id. at 427, 96 S.Ct. at 993;  cf. Patterson v. Von Riesen, 999 F.2d 1235, 1238 (8th Cir.1993) (\"The Supreme Court has created no requirement that prosecutors reveal their trial mistakes to maintain their absolute immunity....\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid further contends that the district court failed to address his claim against the prosecutors in their official capacities.   In order to prevail on an \"official capacity\" claim, Reid would have to show that the particular governmental entity had an unconstitutional custom or policy, Monell v. New York City Dep't. of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2035, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), which its representatives were executing with at least the tacit approval of governmental policymakers.  Id. at 691, 98 S.Ct. at 2036 (\"customs and usages\" of local government may satisfy Monell requirement).  Reid insists that he pleaded actionable claims against the County Prosecutor's office and the County of Hillsborough by alleging that the defendant prosecutors, themselves policymaking officials, continuously refused to produce the exculpatory evidence the court ordered disclosed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not reach the question whether Reid alleged the requisite custom or practice under Monell, since he has not challenged the magistrate-judge's report and recommendation on this basis.  See Henley Drilling Co. v. McGee, 36 F.3d 143, 150 (1st Cir.1994) (citing Park Motor Mart Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 616 F.2d 603, 605 (1st Cir.1980) (\"A party may file objections within ten days or he may not, as he chooses, but he shall do so if he wishes further appellate consideration.\")).  Accordingly, all claims against the prosecutors were properly dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Claims Against the Police Officers</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the false arrest claims were allowed to proceed, the police defendants contended that the district court had dismissed, as frivolous, the claim that the police deprived Reid of due process of law and a fair trial by concealing exculpatory evidence.  Unable to obtain clarification of the district court dismissal order, Reid pursued further discovery in an attempt to establish each police defendant's awareness of the exculpatory evidence and whether, and when, the officers had disclosed what they knew to one another and to the prosecutors.  The district court ultimately permitted the third amended complaint, including the false arrest claims and the concealment claims, to be filed against the police defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) The Third Amended Complaint</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 14, 1992, the magistrate judge ordered the police defendants to respond to Reid's interrogatories and requests for production of documents.  On June 10, Reid filed a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories, followed by motions to join additional defendants and for permission to file the third amended complaint alleging, inter alia, that the police defendants conspired with the prosecutors to conceal the exculpatory evidence.  There followed, in July 1992, another motion to compel production.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to any disposition of Reid's June 10 motions to compel responses to interrogatories and for leave to file the third amended complaint, the police defendants moved for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds based on their contention that other evidence in their possession was sufficient to establish probable cause for Reid's arrest even assuming they had withheld the exculpatory evidence.  In addition, Sergeant Simmons submitted an affidavit denying that he had withheld police reports relating to Misty.  On August 27, 1992, Reid requested further time to respond to the police defendants' motion for summary judgment, because he was unable to do so until the district court ruled on his discovery requests.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November, 1992, the case was transferred from Rhode Island to New Hampshire and reassigned to a different district judge.  On December 14, the newly assigned judge allowed Reid until January 11, 1993, to respond to the police defendants' motion for summary judgment.  At the same time, the court directed that Reid's motions to compel discovery and to substitute the third amended complaint be considered \"withdrawn\" from the docket, without prejudice to their renewal by January 4, 1993.  Reid renewed each motion within the deadline and again sought additional time to respond to the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 22, 1993, the district court allowed Reid seven days to respond in writing to the motion for summary judgment.  The court denied Reid's motion to substitute the third amended complaint insofar as it would add claims against prosecutors Wageling and McDonough for malicious prosecution, denial of due process of law and false imprisonment caused by the failure to disclose the exculpatory evidence, and against Attorney Renfro for conspiring with the prosecutors to conceal the exculpatory evidence from Reid.  At the same time, the court allowed an amendment adding a separate malicious prosecution claim against all police defendants and restating the claim that the police defendants had violated Reid's constitutional rights by continuously withholding the exculpatory evidence.  Lastly, the district court rejected Reid's motion to compel further discovery under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f), on the ground that the discovery sought was not substantially related to the police defendants' qualified immunity claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 5, 1993, the district court granted summary judgment for all police defendants.  Relying primarily on reports of the police investigation preceding Reid's arrest, the court reasoned that the police defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because an objectively reasonable police officer, based on all the evidence, including the exculpatory information withheld until August of 1988, nonetheless could have believed that there was probable cause to arrest Reid for sexually assaulting Misty, even assuming the police defendants concealed the exculpatory evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  The district court did not mention the malicious prosecution claims relating to the alleged failure of the police defendants to disclose the exculpatory evidence, but concluded that \"when probable cause exists notwithstanding the existence of some exculpatory evidence, no violation of the Fourth Amendment occurs and the shield of qualified immunity remains viable.\"  (emphasis added).  Final judgment was entered dismissing all claims against the police defendants on February 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 10, the district court clerk received and docketed Reid's timely opposition to the motion for summary judgment, together with his supporting affidavit, exhibits, memorandum, and statement of contested and uncontested facts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  The supporting materials included the 1985 and 1986 police reports, which recorded prior complaints of sexual assaults against Misty, as well as portions of the DCYS reports describing relevant family history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DCYS reports described how Misty and her sister, Wendy, had been physically abused by their mother.  The allegations were made by Wendy, and by a former roommate of Misty's mother.  The reports related that Misty's mother engaged in sexual intercourse in Misty's presence.  The former roommate described how she had found Misty fellating her four-year-old son on April 17, 1985.  Misty's mother denied the allegations and accused Wendy of making false charges in order to force the mother into allowing her to move in with a boyfriend, and because Wendy was under the influence of drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DCYS reports further indicated that Wendy had refused to return to her mother's residence for a period of two weeks, and that the Manchester Police had attempted, without success, to find Wendy and return her to her mother.  Wendy requested that she be placed in protective custody, but that her request was denied \"due to lack of concrete evidence.\"   Later, after joint counseling, Wendy voluntarily returned home.  Finally, the DCYS reports reflect that during 1985--the year before Reid's arrest--Misty's mother was under investigation for child abuse and neglect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid contended that these materials established that both Misty and her mother were unreliable and that the mother had an ulterior motive for fabricating charges against Reid since she had been the subject of a DCYS investigation for abuse and neglect based on Wendy's allegations that the mother repeatedly had beaten her and Misty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Reid's timely opposition and supporting materials were received and docketed on February 10, the police reports and the DCYS reports were returned to Reid the same day by the clerk, pursuant to Local Rule 14 which provides that the clerk is not required to retain discovery materials.  On February 22, Reid moved for reconsideration of the summary judgment order entered February 8.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  Reconsideration was summarily denied on May 10, 1993, though the exculpatory evidence was not before the court.  The district court noted, however, that it had considered Reid's pro se objection and memorandum in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, which described some of the exculpatory evidence.  Reid appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the summary judgment order de novo, Lallemand v.

As noted above, see note 8 supra, a procedural due process claim may not be redressed under section 1983 where an adequate state remedy exists.  Perez-Ruiz v. Crespo-Guillen, 25 F.3d 40, 42 (1st Cir.1994);  Smith v. Massachusetts Dept. of Correction, 936 F.2d 1390, 1402 (1st Cir.1991);  Torres v. Superintendent of Police, 893 F.2d 404, 410 (1st Cir.1990).  Since New Hampshire recognizes the common-law torts of false arrest, Hickox v. J.B. Morin Agency, Inc., 110 N.H. 438, 272 A.2d 321, 323 (1970), and malicious prosecution, Stock v. Byers, 120 N.H. 844, 424 A.2d 1122, 1123 (1980), the claim that Reid was arrested without probable cause should have been addressed under New Hampshire law, not section 1983.  Richardson v. Chevrefils, 131 N.H. 227, 552 A.2d 89, 92 (1988);  Opinion of the Justices, 126 N.H. 554, 493 A.2d 1182-90 (1985);  Merrill v.

On the other hand, the allegation that the police withheld the exculpatory evidence from the prosecutors does not state an actionable claim under New Hampshire common law and thus must be analyzed under federal law in accordance with section 1983 jurisprudence.  See Walker v. City of New York, 974 F.2d 293, 300 (2d Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1387, 122 L.Ed.2d 762 (1993), and cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1412, 122 L.Ed.2d 784 (1993);  Henderson v.

Boston Five Cents Savings Bank, 54 F.3d 27, 34-35 (1st Cir.1995) (further discovery sought under Rule 56(f) must be such as could establish a triable issue).  The Rule 56(f) motion must \"(1) articulate a plausible basis for the belief that discoverable materials exist which would raise a trialworthy issue and (2) demonstrate good cause for failure to have conducted discovery earlier.\"  Id.  We have held that where the movant satisfies the requirements of Rule 56(f), \"a strong presumption arises in favor of relief.\"  Resolution Trust Corp. v. North Bridge Assoc., 22 F.3d 1198, 1203 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid made a timely motion to defer ruling on the summary judgment motion, supported by an affidavit sufficiently describing the requested discovery.  Prior to the Rule 56(f) motion, moreover, the magistrate judge had ordered the police defendants to respond to interrogatories previously filed by Reid.  The police defendants have never complied with the order to respond to these interrogatories.  The unanswered interrogatories directly concern the critical DCYS reports on Misty, Wendy and their mother, and when the various police defendants became aware of these reports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requested discovery was essential to Reid's claims against the police defendants.  When the individual police defendants learned of the exculpatory evidence is relevant to (1) whether the individual defendants reasonably could have believed there was probable cause to arrest Reid (false arrest claim) and (2) whether they initiated the criminal prosecution knowing that probable cause was lacking (malicious prosecution claim).  When the exculpatory evidence was transmitted to the prosecutors is relevant to determining (3) whether the individual defendants attempted to withhold Brady material from the prosecutors (section 1983 claim).  The unanswered interrogatories were pertinent to all these matters.  As the discovery sought is such that it could arguably generate a trialworthy issue of material fact, we must determine whether Reid complied with the other strictures of Rule 56(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the direct police involvement in the bitter dispute between Wendy and her mother, and the two police reports relating prior sexual abuse of Misty, it cannot be considered implausible in the least that the police had access to the exculpatory information prior to Reid's arrest.  The requested information was within the control of the police defendants, a factor which weighs heavily in favor of relief under Rule 56(f).  North Bridge Assoc., 22 F.3d at 1208 (reversing denial of Rule 56(f) motion).  Furthermore, Reid not only sought discovery in a timely manner, but obtained a court order requiring the police defendants to respond to his interrogatories.  See Mattoon, 980 F.2d at 7 (failure of movant to pursue discovery with diligence permits denial of Rule 56(f) motion).  Finally, the Reid motion, affidavit and interrogatories plainly identified the information requested.  See Murphy v. Timberlane Regional Sch. Dist., 22 F.3d 1186, 1197 (1st Cir.)  (upholding denial of Rule 56(f) motion where movant failed to identify information sought and to submit supporting affidavit), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 484, 130 L.Ed.2d 396 (1994);  Nestor Colon Medina &amp; Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio, 964 F.2d 32, 39 (1st Cir.1992) (finding abuse of discretion in denying portion of Rule 56(f) motion which clearly related facts which would generate a trialworthy issue).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these circumstances Reid was entitled to receive responses to the unanswered interrogatories as previously ordered by the court, and the additional discovery requested in the Rule 56(f) motion.  See generally Farmer v. Brennan, --- U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1985, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (remanding Rule 56(f) ruling for reconsideration in light of Court's holding that the central issue governing plaintiff's claim was when state officials actually acquired certain information).  On remand, therefore, Reid should be allowed to conduct reasonable further discovery relating to the state-law and section 1983 claims against the police defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>C. The Conspiracy Claim Against Defense Counsel</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, Reid challenges the denial of his motion to amend the third amended complaint by adding the claim that Attorney Renfro conspired with the prosecutors to conceal the exculpatory evidence.  We review for abuse of discretion.  Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 59 (1st Cir.1990).  \"Where an amendment would be futile or would serve no legitimate purpose, the district court should not needlessly prolong matters.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The allegation that Renfro saw the exculpatory evidence, yet did not bring it to Reid's attention, is too conclusory to state a viable conspiracy claim.  See Hunt v. Bennett, 17 F.3d 1263, 1268 (10th Cir.)  (allegation that attorney provided incompetent defense held insufficient to generate triable issue on conspiracy charge), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 107, 130 L.Ed.2d 55 (1994).  The conclusory allegation that Renfro had access to the prosecution's file is insufficient to generate a trialworthy issue as to whether he had actual knowledge of the exculpatory evidence, since there is no allegation that the prosecution materials made available to Renfro included the exculpatory material.  See Slotnick v. Garfinkle, 632 F.2d 163, 165-66 (1st Cir.1980) (per curiam).  Accordingly, we conclude that the refusal to allow yet another amendment to the complaint at the present time did not constitute an abuse of discretion under the Correa-Martinez standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>III</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the summary judgment dismissing the claims against prosecutors Wageling and McDonough and the conspiracy claim against defendant Renfro.  We vacate the judgment entered in favor of the police defendants, Simmons, Gilman, Ahern and Paul, on the false arrest, malicious prosecution, and due process claims, and remand all claims against the police defendants for further proceedings, including reasonable discovery.

Thus, dismissal under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1915(d) was proper.  See Purvis v.

Sec. 632-A:6, on its face, bans evidence of prior sexual activity by a prosecutrix in a rape case:  \"Prior consensual sexual activity between the victim and any person other than the actor shall not be admitted into evidence in any prosecution under this chapter.\"   However, the New Hampshire Supreme Court has read a constitutional limitation into this statutory ban in statutory rape cases, so as to preserve the statute from infirmity to constitutional attack.  Howard, 121 N.H. at 61, 426 A.2d 457 (state constitution requires that the jury be informed of prior sexual experience of child prosecutrix in statutory rape case, since jury otherwise could infer that the prosecutrix must have gained her knowledge of sexual anatomy only through the alleged sexual assault).

Thus, these prosecutors retained some discretion, at least, in evaluating whether the putative prior attacks against Misty constituted Brady evidence.  We do not suggest, of course, that the prosecutors were free to disregard the state court disclosure order, nor that there were no alternative means of avoiding a violation, as by submitting the evidence for in camera review</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Reid counters with Martinez v.

These cases are inapposite, as they involved prosecutors who were not acting as advocates for the State.  Moreover, Martinez was reversed, see Martinez, 778 F.2d 553, 555-56 (10th Cir.1985), as to the point relied on by Reid, vacated by the Court, Tyus v.

We vacate the order dismissing the false arrest and malicious prosecution claims against the police defendants and the due process claim alleging that the police defendants intentionally concealed exculpatory impeachment evidence from the prosecutors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The State Court Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid was arrested, without a warrant, on June 21, 1986, and charged with three counts of felonious sexual assault upon a six-year-old girl, Misty ____ (\"Misty\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  He was incarcerated immediately upon arrest.  Manchester Police Sergeant Gary Simmons testified at the probable cause hearing ultimately held on August 22, 1986, and Reid was bound over for trial.  Between September 9, 1986 and June 24, 1987, with assistance from stand-by counsel, Reid filed five successful motions to compel disclosure of exculpatory evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid represented himself at trial, personally cross-examining the State's witnesses, including Misty, with assistance from stand-by counsel.  After the jury acquitted Reid on one count, he moved to set aside his convictions on the two remaining counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime in September 1988, in response to a further motion to disclose exculpatory evidence, the State produced documents tending to undermine the credibility of Misty, her sister Wendy, and their mother.  Among the documents were Manchester Police Department reports, dated December 20, 1985 (\"1985 Report\") and April 4, 1986 (\"1986 Report\"), prepared by Sergeant Simmons, containing questionable accounts of previous sexual assaults allegedly made against Misty by other individuals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Reid also was provided with a New Hampshire Department of Children &amp; Youth Services (\"DCYS\") file on Misty and her family, which included reports that Misty's mother had beaten and bruised Misty and engaged in sexual intercourse with her boyfriend in front of Misty.  These allegations originated, in part, with Misty's sister, Wendy.  It further revealed that Misty's mother had characterized Wendy's allegations as lies prompted by Wendy's drug use and desire to move in with her boyfriend when Wendy was only sixteen years old.  The DCYS file also described aberrant sexual behavior by Misty herself, at age six, such as performing fellatio on another child.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid was released on bail while the superior court conducted a \"nonevidentiary hearing\" on the motion to set aside his convictions.  The court concluded that the police reports of prior sexual assaults constituted exculpatory impeachment evidence which gave rise to a reasonable probability that the outcome of Reid's trial would have been different had the evidence been disclosed to the trial court, since it directly undermined the testimony of Misty and her mother.  Under the New Hampshire Rape Shield Law, Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 632-A:6, \"a defendant must be afforded the opportunity to show, by specific incidents of sexual conduct, that the prosecutrix has the experience and ability to contrive a statutory rape charge against him.\"  State v. Howard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2074938\"><a href=\"/opinion/2074938/state-v-howard/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 61, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span> </span>(1981).  On October 5, 1988, the superior court set the two remaining convictions aside and ordered a new trial.  In December 1988, all charges against Reid were dropped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

It alleged that the prosecutors, by withholding the exculpatory evidence, violated Reid's rights to due process, a fair trial, equal protection of the laws, and to confront and obtain witnesses.  Reid further alleged that he was arrested by Manchester Police Sergeant Gary Simmons on the basis of unreliable information and that Simmons continuously withheld exculpatory evidence between June 1986 and October 1988.  Finally, he alleged that Richard Renfro, Esquire, deprived Reid of his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel by failing to prepare the case adequately for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 19, 1989, a United States magistrate judge recommended that all but one claim be dismissed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The report and recommendation noted that prosecutors Wageling and McDonough were absolutely immune from suit under Imbler v.

It alleged that the police defendants arrested Reid on the basis of unreliable information, in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and deliberately suppressed exculpatory evidence from the time of his arrest until after his trial, in violation of his right to equal protection, the effective assistance of counsel, a fair trial, due process, and the right to confront and obtain witnesses.  The first amended complaint also alleged that prosecutors Wageling and McDonough had instructed their codefendants in the present civil rights action, and the witnesses at Reid's criminal trial, not to mention the police reports on prior sexual assault complaints relating to Misty, thereby prompting these codefendants to respond falsely to inquiries concerning the withheld evidence both before and during the criminal trial.  See Hilliard v.

The first amended complaint reiterated Reid's allegation that the prosecutors deliberately withheld the exculpatory evidence before, during, and for fourteen months after Reid's criminal trial, resulting in his unlawful conviction and imprisonment.  Finally, it alleged that the defendant officers and prosecutors had conspired to deprive Reid of his constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge issued a Further Report and Recommendation on February 6, 1990, which concluded that the first amended complaint stated an actionable Fourth Amendment claim for false arrest against the police defendants and that Reid's motion to add police defendants Gilman, Ahern and Paul should be allowed.  Citing <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109387\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Imbler,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/109387/imbler-v-pachtman/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span>, 96 S.Ct. at 994, the magistrate judge concluded, nonetheless, that the claims against prosecutors Wageling and McDonough were barred by absolute prosecutorial immunity.

The third amended complaint further particularized the claims against the police defendants, asserting that their failure to disclose exculpatory evidence constituted actionable malicious prosecution and violated Reid's constitutional rights.  In contrast to the first amended complaint, which indicated that the prosecutors knew about the exculpatory evidence but instructed the police and others to conceal it, Reid's third amended complaint, liberally construed, see Estelle v. Gamble, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 106, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, the third amended complaint restated Reid's previous allegations against the police defendants and pleaded distinct claims for negligence, false arrest, malicious prosecution, wrongful withholding of exculpatory evidence, and conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the prosecutors and Attorney Renfro, the third amended complaint alleged, in the alternative, that the prosecutors knew of the exculpatory evidence but failed to disclose the information to Renfro, or that the prosecutors disclosed the exculpatory information to Renfro but enlisted him in their conspiracy to conceal the exculpatory information from Reid.  We turn to the various claims raised on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. The Claims Against the Prosecutors</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid contends that the district court erred in dismissing his claims against prosecutors Wageling and McDonough.  He argues that Imbler \"absolute immunity\" should not extend to claims for withholding exculpatory evidence in direct violation of trial court orders, where it is alleged that the prosecutors repeatedly misled the trial court itself throughout the criminal proceedings.  Reid claims that the disclosure orders issued by the trial court displaced whatever discretion the prosecutors may have had concerning disclosure of exculpatory evidence, consequently their failure to disclose was not a prosecutorial function at all, but merely ministerial.  Finally, he contends that the prosecutors repeatedly lied to the trial court about the existence of the exculpatory evidence, whereas in Imbler the prosecutor voluntarily disclosed the evidence shortly after learning of it.  The district court dismissed the claims against the prosecutors as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1915(d).  We review only for abuse of discretion, see Watson v. Caton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599126\"><a href=\"/opinion/599126/charles-n-watson-v-c-mark-caton/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span>, 539 (1st Cir.1993), and find none.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Reid alleged no facts suggesting that the prosecutors had anything to do with the arrest.

In the first place, it is inaccurate to assert, as Reid does, that there was no prosecutorial discretion left to be exercised respecting the disclosure of this evidence.  On the contrary, the disclosure orders were issued in response to motions for \"any 'exculpatory' evidence which could assist [Reid] in the preparation and presentation of his defense,\" broad language indicating a general request for Brady material.  The orders accordingly left the prosecutors with something more than a ministerial function to perform.  The prosecutors were required to determine what evidence in their possession was \"exculpatory\" and subject to disclosure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Cf. Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112894\"><a href=\"/opinion/112894/buckley-v-fitzsimmons/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span> </a></span>(1993) (when prosecutor evaluates evidence and interviews witnesses in preparation for trial, he functions within the scope of absolute immunity).  Imbler expressly recognized that requiring prosecutors to defend--in section 1983 actions--decisions concerning the \"materiality of evidence not revealed to the defense could impose unique and intolerable burdens upon a prosecutor responsible annually for hundreds of indictments and trials.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109387\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Imbler,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/109387/imbler-v-pachtman/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">425-26</span></a></span>, 96 S.Ct. at 993.   The view expressed in the Imbler dissent--that absolute immunity should attach only if the prosecutor has disclosed all facts which cast doubt on the State's evidence--was rejected by the Imbler Court because such a requirement would interfere \"with the legitimate exercise of prosecutorial discretion.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109387\"><a href=\"/opinion/109387/imbler-v-pachtman/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 432, </a></span>96 S.Ct. at 996.

The Claims Against the Police Officers</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the false arrest claims were allowed to proceed, the police defendants contended that the district court had dismissed, as frivolous, the claim that the police deprived Reid of due process of law and a fair trial by concealing exculpatory evidence.  Unable to obtain clarification of the district court dismissal order, Reid pursued further discovery in an attempt to establish each police defendant's awareness of the exculpatory evidence and whether, and when, the officers had disclosed what they knew to one another and to the prosecutors.  The district court ultimately permitted the third amended complaint, including the false arrest claims and the concealment claims, to be filed against the police defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) The Third Amended Complaint</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 14, 1992, the magistrate judge ordered the police defendants to respond to Reid's interrogatories and requests for production of documents.  On June 10, Reid filed a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories, followed by motions to join additional defendants and for permission to file the third amended complaint alleging, inter alia, that the police defendants conspired with the prosecutors to conceal the exculpatory evidence.  There followed, in July 1992, another motion to compel production.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to any disposition of Reid's June 10 motions to compel responses to interrogatories and for leave to file the third amended complaint, the police defendants moved for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds based on their contention that other evidence in their possession was sufficient to establish probable cause for Reid's arrest even assuming they had withheld the exculpatory evidence.  In addition, Sergeant Simmons submitted an affidavit denying that he had withheld police reports relating to Misty.  On August 27, 1992, Reid requested further time to respond to the police defendants' motion for summary judgment, because he was unable to do so until the district court ruled on his discovery requests.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November, 1992, the case was transferred from Rhode Island to New Hampshire and reassigned to a different district judge.  On December 14, the newly assigned judge allowed Reid until January 11, 1993, to respond to the police defendants' motion for summary judgment.  At the same time, the court directed that Reid's motions to compel discovery and to substitute the third amended complaint be considered \"withdrawn\" from the docket, without prejudice to their renewal by January 4, 1993.  Reid renewed each motion within the deadline and again sought additional time to respond to the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 22, 1993, the district court allowed Reid seven days to respond in writing to the motion for summary judgment.  The court denied Reid's motion to substitute the third amended complaint insofar as it would add claims against prosecutors Wageling and McDonough for malicious prosecution, denial of due process of law and false imprisonment caused by the failure to disclose the exculpatory evidence, and against Attorney Renfro for conspiring with the prosecutors to conceal the exculpatory evidence from Reid.  At the same time, the court allowed an amendment adding a separate malicious prosecution claim against all police defendants and restating the claim that the police defendants had violated Reid's constitutional rights by continuously withholding the exculpatory evidence.  Lastly, the district court rejected Reid's motion to compel further discovery under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f), on the ground that the discovery sought was not substantially related to the police defendants' qualified immunity claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 5, 1993, the district court granted summary judgment for all police defendants.  Relying primarily on reports of the police investigation preceding Reid's arrest, the court reasoned that the police defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because an objectively reasonable police officer, based on all the evidence, including the exculpatory information withheld until August of 1988, nonetheless could have believed that there was probable cause to arrest Reid for sexually assaulting Misty, even assuming the police defendants concealed the exculpatory evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  The district court did not mention the malicious prosecution claims relating to the alleged failure of the police defendants to disclose the exculpatory evidence, but concluded that \"when probable cause exists notwithstanding the existence of some exculpatory evidence, no violation of the Fourth Amendment occurs and the shield of qualified immunity remains viable.\"  (emphasis added).  Final judgment was entered dismissing all claims against the police defendants on February 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 10, the district court clerk received and docketed Reid's timely opposition to the motion for summary judgment, together with his supporting affidavit, exhibits, memorandum, and statement of contested and uncontested facts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  The supporting materials included the 1985 and 1986 police reports, which recorded prior complaints of sexual assaults against Misty, as well as portions of the DCYS reports describing relevant family history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DCYS reports described how Misty and her sister, Wendy, had been physically abused by their mother.  The allegations were made by Wendy, and by a former roommate of Misty's mother.  The reports related that Misty's mother engaged in sexual intercourse in Misty's presence.  The former roommate described how she had found Misty fellating her four-year-old son on April 17, 1985.  Misty's mother denied the allegations and accused Wendy of making false charges in order to force the mother into allowing her to move in with a boyfriend, and because Wendy was under the influence of drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DCYS reports further indicated that Wendy had refused to return to her mother's residence for a period of two weeks, and that the Manchester Police had attempted, without success, to find Wendy and return her to her mother.  Wendy requested that she be placed in protective custody, but that her request was denied \"due to lack of concrete evidence.\"   Later, after joint counseling, Wendy voluntarily returned home.  Finally, the DCYS reports reflect that during 1985--the year before Reid's arrest--Misty's mother was under investigation for child abuse and neglect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid contended that these materials established that both Misty and her mother were unreliable and that the mother had an ulterior motive for fabricating charges against Reid since she had been the subject of a DCYS investigation for abuse and neglect based on Wendy's allegations that the mother repeatedly had beaten her and Misty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Reid's timely opposition and supporting materials were received and docketed on February 10, the police reports and the DCYS reports were returned to Reid the same day by the clerk, pursuant to Local Rule 14 which provides that the clerk is not required to retain discovery materials.  On February 22, Reid moved for reconsideration of the summary judgment order entered February 8.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  Reconsideration was summarily denied on May 10, 1993, though the exculpatory evidence was not before the court.  The district court noted, however, that it had considered Reid's pro se objection and memorandum in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, which described some of the exculpatory evidence.

Prior to the Rule 56(f) motion, moreover, the magistrate judge had ordered the police defendants to respond to interrogatories previously filed by Reid.  The police defendants have never complied with the order to respond to these interrogatories.

When the individual police defendants learned of the exculpatory evidence is relevant to (1) whether the individual defendants reasonably could have believed there was probable cause to arrest Reid (false arrest claim) and (2) whether they initiated the criminal prosecution knowing that probable cause was lacking (malicious prosecution claim).  When the exculpatory evidence was transmitted to the prosecutors is relevant to determining (3) whether the individual defendants attempted to withhold Brady material from the prosecutors (section 1983 claim).  The unanswered interrogatories were pertinent to all these matters.  As the discovery sought is such that it could arguably generate a trialworthy issue of material fact, we must determine whether Reid complied with the other strictures of Rule 56(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the direct police involvement in the bitter dispute between Wendy and her mother, and the two police reports relating prior sexual abuse of Misty, it cannot be considered implausible in the least that the police had access to the exculpatory information prior to Reid's arrest.
