This case  arises from  the\r                                           \n\nfraudulent conduct  of an attorney who  forged check indorsements\n\nand  absconded with a widow's  money.  The  attorney, however, is\n\nnot a party.   Rather, the widow, appellant Jean  Kenerson, suing\n\nin  her  capacity as  administratrix  of  her deceased  husband's\n\nestate, seeks  to recoup her  losses from the  institution (\"Dean\n\nWitter\") that wrote the checks  and the banks on which  they were\n\ndrawn.   We  use \"plaintiff\"  (or \"appellant\")  to refer  to Mrs.\n\nKenerson  in her  capacity  as currently  the administratrix  and\n\nformerly co-administrator with the attorney.\n\n          The  trial court granted  motions for  summary judgment\n\nfor all defendants.  We affirm the judgment for Dean Witter,  but\n\nvacate  the judgment  for other  defendants and  remand  for such\n\nfurther  proceedings, consistent  with  this Opinion,  as may  be\n\nnecessary to final disposition.\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\n\n          One week after the death of Vaughan H. Kenerson in July\n\n1981,  the  Sullivan  County  Probate  Court  appointed  Jean  R.\n\nKenerson  and  John  C.  Fairbanks as  co-administrators  of  his\n\nEstate.   Mrs. Kenerson,  having limited experience  in financial\n\nmatters, including estate  administration and investments, relied\n\non  Fairbanks' legal and investment counsel.  She took little, if\n\nany, role in the Estate administration.\n\n          In  August  1981, Fairbanks  opened an  Estate checking\n\naccount at First Citizens  National Bank, listing himself  as the\n\nsole  authorized signatory.   He also maintained  a trust account\n\n                               -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nfor his law offices at the same bank.\n\n          In November  1981, Fairbanks opened an  account for the\n\nEstate  with Dean  Witter  Reynolds, Inc.,  into which  he placed\n\nstock holdings of  the Estate valued  at $248,660.87.   Fairbanks\n\ndid not inform Mrs. Kenerson of  the existence of the Dean Witter\n\naccount  or of  his  withdrawals from  it, totalling  $255,978.38\n\nbetween November 1981 and  the closing of the account  in October\n\n1984.  Fairbanks received  the withdrawals in the form  of checks\n\nthat were mailed to  him.  Most of the checks  were issued in the\n\nfollowing manner:\n\n            Pay to the order of\n               Estate of Vaughan H. Kenerson\n               Jean R. Kenerson &amp;\n               John C. Fairbanks Administrators\n\nOn  some  checks, however,  \"Admin\"  instead  of \"Administrators\"\n\nappeared  on  the last  line.   The  checks  were  drawn on  Dean\n\nWitter's accounts  at Morgan Guaranty  Trust Company and  Bank of\n\nCalifornia.\n\n          Fairbanks deposited  one of the Dean  Witter checks, in\n\nthe  amount of  $150,000, in  his own  account at  First Citizens\n\nNational  Bank.   He  deposited the  other  checks in  the Estate\n\nchecking account that  he had opened  at First Citizens  National\n\nBank.  Fairbanks indorsed  these checks by writing first  his own\n\nname  (without any description of his role), followed by the name\n\nof  Mrs. Kenerson.   No evidence  was offered at  trial that Mrs.\n\nKenerson had ever affirmatively  authorized Fairbanks to  indorse\n\nany checks in her name.\n\n          In  each instance,  First Citizens  National Bank,  the\n\n                               -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\ndepository  bank, accepted  the check and  transmitted it  to the\n\ndrawee  bank -- Morgan  Guaranty  Trust  or  Bank  of  California\n\n(\"Banks\") -- and  the drawee  bank  paid the  check.   Though the\n\nrecord is not explicit,  the parties appear to have  assumed, and\n\nwe take  it to be  undisputed, that  in each instance  the drawee\n\nbank charged Dean Witter's account.\n\n          Fairbanks withdrew  from the  Estate bank account,  for\n\nhis  own benefit, all  but a small  portion of the  funds in that\n\naccount.  Mrs. Kenerson acknowledged  receiving only $20,000.  In\n\nany  event, appellees do not  contend that she  received any more\n\nthan $66,000.   Beyond this sum, little  if any of the  remaining\n\nfunds  from the Estate account with  First Citizens National Bank\n\nwere disbursed in any way that inured to Mrs. Kenerson's benefit,\n\neither individually or in her capacity as co-administrator.\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\n\n          Plaintiff  did  not   sue  the  most  obvious   target,\n\nFairbanks; he  had disappeared.   Instead  she sued  Dean Witter,\n\ndrawer  of  the checks,  and Morgan  Guaranty  Trust and  Bank of\n\nCalifornia,  drawees  (or  payors)  of the  checks.    (Plaintiff\n\ninitially sued  the depositor bank,  too, but claims  against the\n\nF.D.I.C., as that bank's successor in interest, were dismissed by\n\nstipulation.)\n\n          Plaintiff sued  Dean Witter on  the theory that  it was\n\nstill liable to her on the checks because she had received only a\n\nsmall  portion of  their  value  and,  in  her  capacity  as  co-\n\n                               -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nadministrator  and later  sole  administratrix,  was entitled  to\n\nrecover a sum equal to the remainder of the full value.  She sued\n\nthe  drawee Banks  on  the theory  that  they had  converted  the\n\nproceeds  of the  checks  when they  paid  them over  the  forged\n\nindorsements of her name.\n\n          Plaintiff  sued  all  defendants -- the   drawer  (Dean\n\nWitter)  and drawees  (the Banks) -- on  two  different theories.\n\nThe  trial court, in granting summary judgment to all defendants,\n\nrelied, essentially, on one  proposition -- that under the U.C.C.\n\n(as enacted in New Hampshire) and the common law (as developed in\n\nNew Hampshire) all defendants were entitled to rely on Fairbanks'\n\nindorsement when paying on the checks he forged.\n\n          The  trial  court read  the  checks as  payable  to the\n\nEstate.    Based  on  this  reading,  the  court  concluded  that\n\nFairbanks' negotiation  of the checks --  by  his own indorsement\n\nand   the  forged  indorsement  in  plaintiff's  name -- absolved\n\ndefendants of liability to plaintiff.  We conclude that the trial\n\ncourt's  reasoning  rested on  an  impermissible  reading of  the\n\nchecks and  that the rules of  law invoked by the  trial court do\n\nnot apply to the checks at issue in this case.\n\n          We  assume,  without  deciding,  that,  in  general,  a\n\ndetermination as to  who are the payees  of an instrument may  be\n\none of fact  if on  the evidence received,  under the  applicable\n\nlaw,  reasonable  finders  of fact  could  differ.    Cf. Feldman\r                                                                           \n\nConstruction Co. v.  Union Bank,  104 Cal. Rptr.  912, 913  (Cal.\r                                         \n\nApp.  1972) (referring  to \"trial  court's  findings of  fact and\n\n                               -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nconclusions  of law  that the  check was  payable jointly  to two\n\npayees and required the endorsement of both\").  We agree with the\n\ndistrict court that,  on the  evidence before the  court in  this\n\ncase,  factfinders can  not reasonably  differ as  to  the proper\n\nreading  of   the  instruments   at  issue,  and   therefore  the\n\ndetermination of the meaning of those instruments must be made by\n\nthe court \"as a matter of law.\"\n\n          Contrary  to  the  determination of  the  trial  court,\n\nhowever, we conclude that the only reasonable construction of the\n\nchecks  at  issue in  this  case  is that  they  were payable  to\n\nplaintiff  and  Fairbanks  together  (that  is, collectively)  as\n\npayees, in their capacities as administrators of the Estate.1\n\n          As  we explain more fully  below, under the statute and\n\nthe  applicable  precedents,  a  check  payable  to  two  persons\n\ntogether  (as   distinguished  from   a  check  payable   in  the\n\nalternative, to either of two persons) can properly be negotiated\n\nonly on the valid indorsements of both payees.\n\n          Nevertheless, as  explained in Parts III  and IV below,\n\nbecause  Fairbanks  had authority  to  receive  the checks,  even\r                                                        \n\nthough he did not have authority to indorse them with plaintiff's\r                                                     \n\nsignature and  then negotiate  them, summary judgment  for drawer\n\n                    \r                              \n\n1    We  have chosen  to  use the  word  \"together,\"  rather than\n\"jointly,\" because the drafters  of the U.C.C. expressly declined\nto refer  to the payees of  an instrument written in  this way as\n\"joint payees.\"  The U.C.C. omitted the word \"joint\" because that\nterm might be thought to carry a possible  implication of a right\nof survivorship.   New  Hampshire R.S.A. 382-A:3-110,  comment 1.\nNo  such implication is associated with our use of \"collectively\"\nand \"together\" in this Opinion.\n\n                               -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nDean Witter was appropriate, given that the Banks paid the checks\n\nand charged Dean Witter's  account.  This rule as to the drawer's\n\ndischarge   applies  even  when  the  payment   is  on  a  forged\n\nindorsement.  It is,  however, a rule as to  a drawer's liability\n\nand  does not  apply to  drawees.   For this  and other  reasons,\n\nexplained below,  we vacate  summary judgment for  appellee Banks\n\nand remand for further proceedings.\n\n                               III.\r                                         III.\n\n          Plaintiff sued  Dean Witter,  drawer of the  checks, on\n\nthe ground that Dean Witter was liable  to her on the instruments\n\nthemselves.  She brought  her suit against Dean Witter  under New\n\nHampshire R.S.A. 382-A:3-804, which provides in relevant part:\n\n            The owner of an instrument which is lost,\n            whether   by    destruction,   theft   or\n            otherwise, may maintain  an action in his\n            own  name  and  recover  from  any  party\n            liable  thereon upon  due  proof  of  his\n            ownership,  the  facts which  prevent his\n            production  of  the  instrument  and  its\n            terms.\n\nDean  Witter did not  dispute that plaintiff  properly framed her\n\naction  under this  section.   We assume, without  deciding, that\n\nplaintiff sufficiently alleged a cause of action under  3-804.\n\n          Dean  Witter  asserted  that  it  was  discharged  from\n\nliability  to   plaintiff  under  R.S.A.   382-A:3-603(1),  which\n\nprovides in relevant part:\n\n            The liability of any party  is discharged\n            to   the   extent  of   his   payment  or\n            satisfaction to the holder even though it\n            is  made with  knowledge  of a  claim  of\n            another person to the instrument . . . .\n\n                               -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nThe trial court, relying on this clause, granted summary judgment\n\nfor Dean Witter on the ground that Fairbanks was a holder and had\n\nreceived  payment on  the  checks Dean  Witter drew  on defendant\n\nBanks.\n\n                                A.\r                                          A.\n\n          We  review de  novo the district  court's determination\n\nthat  3-603 applies, because the issue is one of law.   See Salve\r                                                                           \n\nRegina  College v. Russell, 499  U.S. 225, 239  (1991) (courts of\r                                    \n\nappeals must  review state-law determinations of  district courts\n\nde novo).\n\n          New Hampshire  courts  have not  explicitly  considered\n\nwhich U.C.C. provisions apply to instruments drafted precisely in\n\nthe manner of the  instruments in this case.  Thus, in construing\n\n 3-603,  as  well as  other statutes  referred  to later  in this\n\nOpinion, we do not  have the benefit of direct  guidance from New\n\nHampshire case law.   We  are guided, however,  by principles  of\n\nstatutory interpretation  that are well settled  in New Hampshire\n\nlaw.   We begin by considering  the words of the  statute, and on\n\nthe assumption \"that all words in  [the] statute were meant to be\n\ngiven  meaning in  the interpretation  of the  statute,\" Town  of\r                                                                           \n\nWolfeboro v. Smith,  556 A.2d 755, 756-57  (N.H. 1989).   We take\r                            \n\naccount also of our obligation to determine manifested meaning of\n\na statute \"from  its construction  as a whole,  not by  examining\n\nisolated words and phrases.\"  Petition of Jane Doe, 564 A.2d 433,\r                                                            \n\n438 (N.H. 1989).\n\n          We  conclude, in  light  of various  provisions of  the\n\n                               -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nstatute  taken  together,  that  payment  to  Fairbanks  was  not\n\n\"payment   . . .  to   the  holder\"   for  purposes   of   3-603.\n\nNonetheless,  Fairbanks  was  an  agent  of  plaintiff  for  some\n\npurposes, and was authorized to receive the checks on her behalf;\n\ntherefore, under a rule of the  common law that was not abrogated\n\nby  enactment  of  the U.C.C.  in  New  Hampshire,  Dean Witter's\n\ndelivery of the checks  to Fairbanks, followed by the  payment of\n\nthe checks through  the Banks, absolved Dean Witter  of liability\n\non the instruments.\n\n          In  all  relevant respects,  the New  Hampshire statute\n\nmirrors  precisely the  Uniform Commercial  Code.

Negotiation of  an instrument\n\nthat  is payable to the order of specific persons is accomplished\n\nby   delivery  of   the   instrument  with   all  the   necessary\n\nindorsements.  Id.\r                            \n\n          It is  undisputed that  Fairbanks was in  possession of\n\nthe checks, and that the checks were drawn to him in his capacity\n\nas administrator.  They were not drawn to him alone, however, but\n\nto   him  and   plaintiff   together  in   their  capacities   as\n\n                    \r                              \n\n          with any necessary indorsement; if payable to\n          bearer it is negotiated by delivery.  \n\n           3-301  Rights of a Holder.  The holder of an\r                     3-301  Rights of a Holder\n          instrument whether or not he is the owner may\n          transfer  or  negotiate  it  and,  except  as\n          otherwise  provided  in   Section  3-603   on\n          payment  or  satisfaction,  discharge  it  or\n          enforce payment in his own name.  \n\n           3-603  Payment or Satisfaction.\r                     3-603  Payment or Satisfaction.\n            (1)The liability of any party is discharged\n          to  the extent of his payment or satisfaction\n          to  the holder  even though  it is  made with\n          knowledge of a claim of another person to the\n          instrument . . . .\n\n           3-804      Lost,    Destroyed   or    Stolen\r                     3-804      Lost,    Destroyed   or    Stolen\n          Instruments.\r                    Instruments.\n          The owner  of an  instrument  which is  lost,\n          whether by destruction,  theft or  otherwise,\n          may maintain  an action  in his own  name and\n          recover  from any  party liable  thereon upon\n          due proof  of his ownership, the  facts which\n          prevent his production of the  instrument and\n          its terms.\n\n                               -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nadministrators.   Neither co-administrator, acting on  his or her\n\nown, could  negotiate the  checks.   Rather, the  indorsements of\n\nboth administrators were \"necessary,\" as that term is used in  3-\n\n202(1), to \"negotiate[]\" the  checks as that term is  used in  3-\n\n116(b), according to which  an instrument payable to two  or more\n\npersons, if  not in the  alternative, is payable  to all  of them\n\ntogether and  may be \"negotiated\" only by all of them.  Plaintiff\n\nnever  indorsed the  checks.   Thus,  Fairbanks did  not properly\n\nnegotiate the checks  when he signed his  indorsement, forged the\n\nindorsement  of  plaintiff,  and  delivered  the  checks  to  the\n\ndepository   bank.    Consequently,   Dean  Witter's  payment  to\n\nFairbanks  on those checks did not  constitute the \"payment . . .\n\nto  the holder\" that results in discharge of a drawer's liability\n\nunder   3-603.     To   conclude  otherwise  would   be  entirely\n\ninconsistent with  3-116(b), under which, as stated in a comment,\n\n\"the  rights  of one  [co-payee] are  not discharged  without his\n\nconsent by the act of the other [co-payee].\"  See R.S.A. 382-A:3-\r                                                           \n\n116, comment.\n\n          We need not, and do not, decide whether Fairbanks was a\n\nholder  for  any  other  purpose  contemplated  by  the  statute.\n\nRather, we decide only  that, in the circumstances of  this case,\n\nunder   3-603 Fairbanks  was  not a  holder  for the  purpose  of\n\ndischarge  of  Dean  Witter's  liability when  he  received  Dean\n\nWitter's payment through the drawee Banks.\n\n          Similarly,  because  the   checks  were  not   properly\n\nnegotiated by  Fairbanks, the  depository bank did  not become  a\n\n                               -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nholder of the checks  when Fairbanks delivered them to  the bank.\n\nSee R.S.A.  382-A:3-202(1).  Thus,  Dean Witter's payment  to the\r             \n\ndepository  bank,   through  the  drawee  banks,   also  did  not\n\nconstitute payment to a holder under  3-603.\n\n          As  stated above, we  conclude that the  checks in this\n\ncase  were payable to the co-administrators together.  It is true\n\nthat the manner in which the checks were written is  not one that\n\nfalls squarely within an  explicit provision of the statute.   In\n\nthese circumstances, we examine hypothetical variations, at least\n\nsome  of which are explicitly referred to  in the statute.  We do\n\nso with the purpose of  considering which, among our hypothetical\n\ninstruments, the instruments at issue here most closely resemble.\n\n          Suppose,  first, the  checks had  been made  payable to\n\n\"Estate  of  Vaughan  H.  Kenerson,\"  without  more.    It  might\n\nplausibly   have  been   argued  that   under   3-110(1)(e)   the\n\nindorsement  of   either  of  the  co-administrators   (that  is,\n\nFairbanks  as  administrator or  Mrs. Kenerson  as administrator)\n\nwould have  discharged drawer  liability under  3-603.   Another,\n\nand probably  more reasonable,  interpretation of the  statute is\n\nthat a  check drafted in this  manner would be payable  to all of\n\nthe  representatives  together, in  the  absence  of an  explicit\n\nauthorization in fact or in some source of law outside the U.C.C.\n\nfor  each to act alone;  but we need  not and do  not decide this\n\nissue.\n\n          The trial  court applied  3-110(1)(e) to  the checks in\n\nthis case, as if they  had been drawn only to \"Estate  of Vaughan\n\n                               -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nH.  Kenerson.\"   Since  Fairbanks  was  a representative  of  the\n\nEstate,  the court reasoned, the checks were payable to him under\n\n 3-110(1)(e).  As we have stated above and explain further below,\n\nhowever,  on  the record  in this  case,  the application  of  3-\n\n110(1)(e) to these checks was erroneous as a matter of law.\n\n          Suppose, second,  the checks  had been made  payable to\n\n\"John C. Fairbanks &amp; Jean R. Kenerson.\"  Then the indorsements of\n\nboth in their  individual capacities would have been  required to\n\nnegotiate the checks under   3-116(b).  See R.S.A. 382-A:3-116(b)\r                                                     \n\n&amp; comment.  According to that provision, an instrument payable to\n\ntwo or more persons, if not in the alternative, is payable to all\n\nof them (\"together,\"  one may say) and may  be negotiated only by\n\nall  of them (\"together\").  See, e.g., Litchfield v. Pfeffer, 116\r                                                                      \n\nN.H.  485, 487-88, 363 A.2d  413, 415 (1976)  (holding that trial\n\ncourt properly found under   3-116(b) that notes payable to  \"Roy\n\nF.  Litchfield  and  Gloria  B.  Litchfield or  order\"  could  be\n\ndischarged only by both of them).\n\n          Third,  suppose the  checks  had been  made payable  to\n\n\"John C.  Fairbanks &amp;  Jean  R. Kenerson,  Administrators of  the\n\nEstate of Vaughan H. Kenerson.\"  Then the checks would  have been\n\npayable to  the named fiduciaries, according  to  3-117(b), which\n\nprovides that\n\n            [a]n  instrument made payable  to a named\n            person   with   the  addition   of  words\n            describing   him   . . .  as   any  . . .\n            fiduciary [other than an agent or officer\n            of a specified person] is payable  to the\n            payee and may be negotiated . . . by him.\n\nSee also  R.S.A. 382-A:3-117(b), comment 2  (providing example of\r                  \n\n                               -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n\"John Doe, Administrator of the Estate of Richard Roe\").  In this\n\nthird type of case, in  which the checks are payable to  both but\n\nin their fiduciary  capacities, under  3-116(b) the  indorsements\n\nof both  in  their  fiduciary capacities  would  be  required  to\n\nnegotiate the checks.  Accordingly,  the indorsements of both  in\n\ntheir fiduciary capacities would be necessary to invoke  3-603 to\n\nrelieve the drawer of liability.\n\n          \"Persons,\"  as the term is used in  3-116 and elsewhere\n\nin  the  statute, does  not mean  only  \"natural persons.\"   This\n\ncommon  sense  interpretation of  \"persons\"  is  reinforced by  a\n\nstatutory definition.  R.S.A. 382-A:1-201(30) (defining person as\n\nincluding  \"individual\"  or  \"organization\").    It  is   further\n\nreinforced  by usage  elsewhere in  the statute  and  in judicial\n\nopinions.    See  R.S.A. 382-A:3-110(1)(e)  (listing  \"an estate,\r                          \n\ntrust or  fund\" as  possible \"person[s]\"  that  could qualify  as\n\npayees); see also Equipment Distributors v. Charter Oak Bank, 379\r                                                                      \n\nA.2d  682 (Conn. App. Sess. 1977) (two business entities); Alumax\r                                                                           \n\nAluminum Corp.  v. Norstar  Bank, N.A.,  572 N.Y.S.2d  133 (A.D.4\r                                                \n\nDept.  1991)   (same).    Thus,   \"persons\"  includes   corporate\n\nfiduciaries and natural persons in their fiduciary capacities, as\n\nwell as natural persons individually.\n\n          The checks in this  case appear most like those  in the\n\nthird  of the  categories described  above.   Except for  the few\n\ninstances in  which the word \"Administrators\"  was abbreviated to\n\n\"Admin,\" the checks were made payable to the order of:\n\n            Estate of Vaughan H. Kenerson\n            Jean R. Kenerson &amp;\n\n                               -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\n            John C. Fairbanks Administrators\n\n          It is true that the sequence of names on all the checks\n\nin  this  case  is  the reverse  of  the  sequence  in  the third\n\nhypothetical   category   described    above,   in   which    the\n\nadministrators  were  named  first  and  the  estate   afterward.\n\nAppellees  urge  that  we   attach  great  significance  to  this\n\ndifference in  sequence.  They contend that it was proper for the\n\ntrial  court to  apply   3-110(1)(e) because  the Estate  appears\n\nfirst  in  the sequence.    We do  not  interpret the  statute as\n\nsupporting this contention,  and appellees do  not cite a  single\n\ncase that suggests we should.\n\n          A more  reasonable interpretation is  that  3-110(1)(e)\n\nis directed to cases in which the  name of the estate is the only\r                                                                           \n\nname to appear.  Comment 2 to  3-110 makes this point clear:\n\n            2.   Paragraph (e)  of subsection  (1) is\n            intended   to   change   the  result   of\n            decisions   which   have  held   that  an\n            instrument  payable to  the order  of the\n            estate  of  a  decedent  was  payable  to\n            bearer . . . .   The intent in such cases\n            is obviously  not to make  the instrument\n            payable to  bearer, but  to the  order of\n            the representative of the estate.\n\nR.S.A. 382-A:3-110, comment 2.\n\n          Appellees  also contend  that the  checks in  this case\n\nshould  be subject to  3-110(1)(e) because the name of the Estate\n\nappears alone  on the first line and is not connected by \"and\" or\n\n\"or\"  to the names of  its administrators.   For several reasons,\n\nthe argument is not persuasive.\n\n          First,  one  would not  expect  to  see  \"and\" or  \"or\"\n\n                               -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nlinking the name of an estate with its administrators because the\n\naddition of  such language  would ordinarily be  both unnecessary\n\nand  confusing.   Accordingly,  we   decline  to  adopt,   as  an\n\nalternative  reading of  the checks,  either (1)  that  they were\n\npayable to the  Estate and  Mrs. Kenerson and  Fairbanks, or  (2)\r                                                       \n\nthat  they were  payable  to  the  Estate  or  Mrs.  Kenerson  or\r                                                                           \n\nFairbanks.   Nor does the absence of punctuation (whether a comma\n\nor  a semicolon) between  the first and  second lines, strengthen\n\nsignificantly the argument for some alternative reading.  Placing\n\nthe name of  the first  named administrator on  a separate  line,\r                                                                    \n\nbelow the line on which the name of the Estate appeared and above\n\nthe line  on which  \"John C. Fairbanks  Administrators\" appeared,\n\nconveyed the message  that she  and the individual  named on  the\n\nnext  line, with \"&amp;\"  between them, were  named as administrators\n\nand not as individuals.\n\n          Second, we need  not explore  whether it  would make  a\n\ndifference if Jean R.  Kenerson had been named individually  as a\n\npayee.   She was not so named.   Even the checks on which \"Admin\"\n\nrather  than   \"Administrators\"  appeared  are   not  subject  to\n\ninterpretation as  naming her in  her individual capacity.   That\n\nreading   is  rebutted  by  the  sequence   in  which  the  names\n\nappear -- on  the first  line, the  Estate; on  the  second line,\n\n\"Jean R. Kenerson\";  and on  the third line,  \"John C.  Fairbanks\n\nAdmin.\"   If  only Fairbanks  were being named  as administrator,\n\ncommon sense would reject the use of a sequence in which his name\n\nand  designation as administrator were separated from the name of\n\n                               -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nthe estate by the name of another payee who was meant to be named\n\nonly individually.\n\n          Third, if we were  to adopt the proposed interpretation\n\nof  the statute,  the result would  be to  give no  effect to the\n\ndrawer's  manifested   intent  in  naming   the  individuals   as\n\nadministrators only and not as individuals.\n\n          For all  these reasons,  we conclude that   3-110(1)(e)\n\ndoes not apply to this case.  Thus, the trial court erred when it\n\nread the checks as  instruments controlled by  3-110(1)(e) rather\n\nthan instruments  controlled by   3-116(b) and  3-117(b).   These\n\nsections  together made plaintiff's  indorsement essential to the\n\nproper negotiation of the checks under  3-202(1).   Absent proper\n\nnegotiation,  payment to Fairbanks was  not \"payment . . . to the\n\nholder\" under  3-603.\n\n          Our  conclusion derived  from the  text of  the statute\n\nitself, absent New Hampshire  case law in point, is  confirmed by\n\nour examination of interpretations of the U.C.C. by the courts of\n\nother states and a respected commentator.\n\n          A recent decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt  is  closely  analogous.   In  GMAC  v.  Abington  Casualty\r                                                                           \n\nInsurance Co., 602 N.E.2d 1085 (Mass. 1992), the defendant issued\r                       \n\nto an individual  a physical damage  insurance policy covering  a\n\nmotor vehicle that the individual had purchased.   Plaintiff GMAC\n\nwas the  holder of a security  interest in the vehicle  and was a\n\nloss  payee  beneficiary  of  that  policy.    When  the  vehicle\n\nsustained damage,  defendant Abington  issued a check  payable to\n\n                               -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nthe order of the individual and GMAC.  The check was delivered to\n\nthe  individual, who  presented  it to  the  drawee bank  without\n\nGMAC's  indorsement;  the individual  received full  payment, and\n\nGMAC received none of  the proceeds.  The Supreme  Judicial Court\n\n(\"SJC\") held  that  the payee,  GMAC, could  proceed against  the\n\ndrawer on the underlying contract claim, or under  3-804.  Id. at\r                                                                        \n\n1088-89.\n\n          The SJC  specifically observed  that suit  under  3-804\n\nwas  not barred by  3-603  because the individual  who cashed the\n\ncheck  without  GMAC's indorsement  \"was  never a  holder  of the\n\ncheck.\"    Id. at  1089.   Since GMAC  was  named as  a co-payee,\r                        \n\naccording to  3-116(b) the  check could not be discharged  by the\n\nindividual payee acting  alone.   Id. at 1087-88.   The SJC  also\r                                               \n\nrelied on  3-603, observing  that without GMAC's indorsement, the\n\npurchaser  of the  vehicle  could not  have  taken the  check  by\n\nnegotiation and thus  did not  become a  holder under   3-202(1).\n\nId.  at 1088.    Without payment  to a  holder, the  liability of\r             \n\ndefendant was not discharged under   3-603.  Id.  In  relation to\r                                                          \n\nthis issue, the  case before us is in all  material respects like\n\nGMAC v.  Abington, though  different in  details not  material to\r                           \n\nthis  issue.   It is  true that  the SJC  observed that  GMAC and\n\nAbington were \"not in  an agency relationship,\" id. at  1087, and\r                                                             \n\nappellees  in this case have  argued that Fairbanks  was an agent\n\nfor plaintiff.   We  hold, however,  that in  the absence of  any\n\nevidence  that  plaintiff   actually  or  apparently   authorized\n\nFairbanks to indorse and  negotiate checks on her behalf,  he was\n\n                               -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nnot  an agent  for  indorsing  and  negotiating the  Dean  Witter\n\nchecks.  Thus, the present case, like GMAC v. Abington, is one in\r                                                                \n\nwhich  for these  purposes  the payees  were  \"not in  an  agency\n\nrelationship.\"  Id. at 1087.\r                             \n\n          In  other but  closely analogous  circumstances, courts\n\nand  commentators have adopted the same reasoning and come to the\n\nsame conclusion  as we do, namely,  that payment on  a missing or\n\nforged  indorsement does  not discharge  a party  from liability.\n\nWhite  and Summers address, for example, the situation in which a\n\nthief,  rather than a co-payee, steals order paper and forges the\n\npayee's indorsement.   The  thief who  steals order  paper cannot\n\nqualify  as a  holder,  and  the  thief's  signature  is  not  an\n\nindorsement.  White  &amp; Summers, 680 n.7. Subsequent takers, also,\n\nwill not be holders.  Id. at 680.  Thus, when the drawee or maker\r                                   \n\npays the  presenter, the payor  will not have  paid a holder,  no\n\ndischarge under  3-603 will have occurred, and the original owner\n\ncan  recover  on the  stolen instrument  under   3-804 or  on the\n\nunderlying obligation.  Id.\r                                     \n\n          The same result holds  where an indorsement is missing,\n\nrather  than forged.   In a suit  by the drawee  bank against the\n\ncollecting bank for accepting a check with a missing indorsement,\n\na California appeals  court noted  that \"[w]hen a  check is  made\n\npayable  to two  payees jointly,  only proper  negotiation, i.e.,\n\nendorsement by  both, results in the payment contemplated\" by  3-\n\n603.  Feldman Construction Co. v. Union Bank, 104 Cal. Rptr. 912,\r                                                      \n\n914  (Cal. Ct.  App. 1972).   That court  also relied  on  3-201,\n\n                               -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\ndefining a holder, and  3-202, defining proper negotiation.\n\n          It may be suggested that  cases holding that a co-payee\n\nwho absconds with funds is not a holder appear to be inconsistent\n\nwith   3-603's reference  to a  \"party who in  bad faith  pays or\n\nsatisfies  a holder who acquires  the instrument by  theft or who\r                                                                           \n\n. . . holds through  one who  so acquired it.\"   R.S.A.  382-A:3-\r                                                      \n\n603(1)(a) (emphasis  added).  The meaning of holder as it is used\n\nin  this instance, appears, however,  to be a  deviation from the\n\ndefinition of  the term in   1-201(20).  Reading   3-603 together\n\nwith   1-201(20), 3-202(1),  and 3-116(b), one  is driven to  the\n\nconclusion that payment to a thief does not constitute payment to\n\na holder for the purpose of discharge under  3-603.\n\n                                B.\r                                          B.\n\n          The trial court also relied on Protective Check Writers\r                                                                           \n\nCo.  v.  Collins,  23 A.2d  770  (N.H.  1942), interpreting  that\r                          \n\nopinion as standing for  the unqualified proposition (referred to\n\nhere  as the  \"single-entity  rule\") that  the  acts of  one  co-\n\nrepresentative of an  estate -- namely, Fairbanks -- are  treated\n\nin  law as  the acts of  the other -- namely,  plaintiff.   It is\n\nunclear whether the trial  court, in its citation to  the single-\n\nentity rule,  meant that only Fairbanks'  signature was necessary\n\nto  negotiate the checks, or  instead meant that  under this rule\n\nFairbanks  was authorized  to  sign the  indorsement  of his  co-\n\nadministrator, plaintiff.\n\n          To the extent that the trial court meant the former, we\n\n                               -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nhave already  rejected the argument that under  New Hampshire law\n\nDean  Witter  was relieved  of liability  by  paying on  only one\n\neffective  indorsement   where  two  were  required.     Even  if\n\nProtective Check Writers can  properly be interpreted as standing\r                                  \n\nfor  the proposition  that fewer  than all  co-administrators may\n\nnegotiate   an   instrument  made   payable   to   all  of   them\n\ntogether -- and we do not  decide whether it does -- it  would be\n\ndisplaced by the provisions  of the later-enacted statute.\n\n          To the extent that the trial court relied on Protective\r                                                                           \n\nCheck   Writers   for   the   proposition  that   Fairbanks,   as\r                         \n\nadministrator, was authorized  in law to sign  the indorsement of\n\nplaintiff,  his co-administrator,  we  conclude that  the statute\n\ndisplaces  that purported  rule also,  even if  we assume  it did\n\nexist  (in the form  assumed by the  trial judge)  in earlier New\n\nHampshire law.\n\n          In analyzing  the relationship between the  statute and\n\nthe common law that  existed before its enactment, we  start with\n\nnot only the guidance of  Town of Wolfeboro and Petition  of Jane\r                                                                           \n\nDoe, supra,  but as  well  the legislative  mandate that  \"unless\r                    \n\ndisplaced  by  the  particular  provisions of  this  chapter  the\n\nprinciples  of   law  and  equity  . . .   shall  supplement  its\n\nprovisions.\"  See R.S.A.  382-A:1-103. Construing sections of the\r                           \n\nstatute in combination, as we must under Petition of Jane Doe, we\r                                                                       \n\nconclude that   3-116(b) and 3-117(b) leave no room for operation\n\nof the single-entity rule regarding commercial instruments.\n\n          The  statute  is  premised  on an  assumption  that  an\n\n                               -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\ninstrument  may be made payable to an estate, see R.S.A. 382-A:3-\r                                                           \n\n110(1)(e),   or  its  fiduciaries,   see  R.S.A.  382-A:3-117(b).\r                                                  \n\nAlthough   both   clauses    are   worded    in   the    singular\n\n(\"representative\"  in  3-110(1)(e), \"named person\" in  3-117(b)),\n\nand  the illustrations in  the comment to   3-117(b) include only\n\none fiduciary, words in  the singular number include the  plural.\n\nSee R.S.A. 382-A:1-102(5)(a).   We  need not decide,  and do  not\r             \n\ndecide,   whether,   under    3-110(1)(e)   and   other  relevant\n\nprovisions,  a check  made  payable to  an  estate alone  can  be\n\nnegotiated on the indorsement of just one of its  administrators.\n\nWhere, however, a  check is payable to  two named administrators,\n\nnot in the alternative,  3-116(b) declares that the instrument is\n\npayable  to the two fiduciaries  together, and is negotiable only\n\nby  the two together.   It would  render  3-116(b)  a nullity, at\n\nleast with respect to checks made payable to co-administrators of\n\nestates, to hold that  one of two or more  co-administrators can,\n\nas   a  matter   of  law,   sign   the  indorsements   of  fellow\n\nadministrators and proceed to  negotiate what is \"negotiable only\n\nby  all  of them.\"    Thus,  3-117(b)  and   3-116(b), considered\n\ntogether, displace the common law single-entity rule.\n\n          Appellees rely on a  commentator's suggestion that  the\n\nproblem  of who can indorse an instrument made payable to several\n\nadministrators  \"will  depend,  as  it did  under  prior  law, on\n\nwhether  one  personal representative  has  authority  to act  on\n\nbehalf  of the others . . . .\"   See Anderson,  UCC 3d  3-116:31.\r                                              \n\nHis  premise,  that  \"[t]he  Code  makes  no  provision  in  this\n\n                               -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nrespect,\" however, is  subject to  question.  Perhaps  it may  be\n\nsaid that the Code  does not do so in any single  provision.  But\n\nthe  Code,  as  just  noted, explicitly  allows  for  instruments\n\npayable  to several persons together, and we see no reason not to\n\napply   3-116 when the  \"persons\" are individuals  named in their\n\ncapacity as fiduciaries.\n\n          The rules of construction  stated in the statute itself\n\nfurther  strengthen this  interpretation.   The statute  declares\n\nthat it is to be \"liberally construed and applied to  promote its\n\nunderlying purposes  and policies.\"  R.S.A.  382-A:1-102(1).  One\n\npurpose of the statute is to \"simplify, clarify and modernize the\n\nlaw   governing  commercial   transactions.\"     R.S.A.  382-A:1-\n\n102(2)(a).  Appellees have  offered no reason to infer  that, due\n\nto policy considerations unique to the administration of estates,\n\neither  the   drafters  of  the  U.C.C.   or  state  legislatures\n\n(including that of New Hampshire), in proposing and adopting   3-\n\n116(b) and  3-117(b),  manifested an  intent  to leave  intact  a\n\ncommon law single-entity  rule, in those states  where it existed\n\nor where no precedent existed one way or the other.  Furthermore,\n\nthough some recent cases in  other jurisdictions continue to cite\n\nthe single-entity  rule, see, e.g., Holmes  v. Lankenau Hospital,\r                                                                          \n\n627  A.2d  763, 768  (Penn.  Sup. Ct.  1993), a  growing  body of\n\nauthority in the field of probate law (even if still a  minority)\n\nrejects the rule.   See Unif. Probate Code   3-717, 8 U.L.A.  340\r                                 \n\n(1983) (\"If two or  more persons are appointed co-representatives\n\nand unless the will provides otherwise, the concurrence of all is\n\n                               -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nrequired  on  all  acts  connected with  the  administration  and\n\ndistribution of the estate.\").\n\n          Our  conclusion that the statute should  be read as not\n\npreserving  any  purportedly pre-existing  single-entity  rule is\n\nfurther supported by  the lack of any showing that  this rule was\n\never firmly embedded in  New Hampshire law.  Appellees  cite only\n\none  New  Hampshire case,  Protective  Check  Writers, supra,  in\r                                                                      \n\nsupport of their  contention that the single-entity rule  was and\n\nis  now a  part of  New Hampshire  law.   The cited  passage from\n\nProtective Check  Writers, however,  is a passing  reference, not\r                                   \n\nessential to the basis  of the decision, without citation  to any\n\nother case, either in New Hampshire or elsewhere.\n\n          The  reference  to   the  single-entity  rule   in  the\n\nProtective Check  Writers  opinion was  made  in the  process  of\r                                   \n\nexplaining the  holding that each co-representative  of an estate\n\nis liable for  his or her own  wrongdoing.  23 A.2d at  772.  The\n\ncourt thus had no reason to be concerned with  the very different\n\nquestion whether one co-representative  has authority to bind the\n\nestate  by action taken without the approval or even knowledge of\n\nthe  other.  Moreover, the opinion in that case explicitly called\n\nattention  to the  fact  that (1) \"both  administrators [in  that\n\ncase] were equally  participants\" in the transaction at issue, 23\n\nA.2d  at 772 (\"making  payments\"), and  (2) the issue  before the\n\ncourt  \"was only  the  chargeability of  Mrs.  Ney, leaving  [the\n\nchargeability] of her co-administrator  undetermined.\"  Id.    We\r                                                                     \n\nconclude  that  Protective Check  Writers  does  not support  the\r                                                   \n\n                               -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nproposition for which appellees cite it.\n\n          Appellees suggested  in oral argument that  the lack of\n\nreported  New  Hampshire cases  regarding the  single-entity rule\n\nindicates that  the rule  was so  taken  for granted  by the  New\n\nHampshire bar that it was not the subject of litigation, or, more\n\nprecisely, litigation that culminated in a reported opinion.  The\n\nsuggestion is unpersuasive in view of divided authority elsewhere\n\nand  the interest litigants would have in presenting the issue in\n\nany case where it would be likely to affect the outcome.\n\n          Finally, even if  we were  to assume, for  the sake  of\n\nargument, that  New Hampshire had adopted  the single-entity rule\n\nat a  time  before  the  New Hampshire  legislature  enacted  the\n\ncommercial code,  this case  falls within  one of the  \"equitable\n\nexceptions\"  to the rule to which the opinion in Protective Check\r                                                                           \n\nWriters referred.   See id.,  23 A.2d at  772.  Because  the rule\r                                     \n\nitself was  not in issue,  the court  did not explain  what these\n\nexceptions might  be.  The  equities in the case  before us would\n\nweigh strongly  toward recognition of  an exception, even  if the\n\nsingle-entity rule were assumed to be  part of the current law of\n\nNew Hampshire.\n\n          For the  foregoing reasons, we conclude  that we cannot\n\ndetermine that under  the law  of New Hampshire  the trial  court\n\nsummary judgment for Dean Witter can be sustained on the basis of\n\n 3-603 and Protective Check Writers.\r                                             \n\n                               -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\n                                C.\r                                          C.\n\n          Even though payment  to Fairbanks was not  payment to a\n\n\"holder\"  for purposes of  3-603, we conclude that Dean Witter is\n\nrelieved of  liability by a  common law rule  of agency that,  we\n\nconclude,  has been and  continues to be  part of the  law of New\n\nHampshire as in other jurisdictions.\n\n          According to the Restatement (Second) of Agency,\r                                                                   \n\n            If an agent who  is authorized to receive\n            a  check  payable  to  the  principal  as\n            conditional     payment    forges     the\n            principal's endorsement to such  a check,\n            the maker is relieved of liability to the\n            principal  if the  drawee  bank pays  the\n            check  and  charges  the  amount  to  the\n            maker.\n\nRestatement  (Second) of  Agency   178(2) (1958).   Although  the\r                                          \n\nRestatement refers to  a \"maker\"  rather than a  \"drawer,\" it  is\n\nevident  from  the reference  to a  \"drawee  bank\" that  the rule\n\napplies  to a  drawer.    No  reported  New  Hampshire  case  has\n\nconsidered  this rule.  The modern  trend in other jurisdictions,\n\nhowever, is consistent with the Restatement.  Also, jurisdictions\n\nthat have considered the question  since enactment of the  U.C.C.\n\nhave  held that this  rule of the  common law  of agency survives\n\nunder the U.C.C.\n\n          Several  cases have involved  circumstances in which an\n\nattorney forged a  client's indorsement on a  check received from\n\nan alleged  tortfeasor or  the tortfeasor's insurance  company in\n\nsettlement of the client's tort claim.\n\n               See  Terry  v.

The U.C.C. provides, however,\n\nthat  \"[u]nless displaced  by the  particular provisions  of this\n\nchapter the principles of law and equity, including . . . the law\n\nrelative to . . . principal and agent . . .  shall supplement its\n\nprovisions.\"   R.S.A. 382-A:1-103.   We conclude that  the U.C.C.\n\nand  the New  Hampshire statute  do not  displace the  common law\n\nagency rule.\n\n          The U.C.C. and the New Hampshire statute do not contain\n\n\"particular provisions\" that provide  for a cause of action  by a\n\npayee against a drawer  where a co-payee forges the  payee's name\n\nand  alone obtains the proceeds.

Operation  of that  section,\n\nhowever, is based on the stated premise that the defendant drawer\n\nof the instrument  is \"liable  thereon.\"  Thus,   3-804 does  not\n\n\"displace\" common law rules, such as  the rule of agency at issue\n\nhere,  that are  relevant  to determining  the  liability of  the\n\ndrawer.\n\n          The  Supreme  Judicial   Court  of  Massachusetts   has\n\nexplicitly  come to  the same  conclusion.   In Terry  v. Kemper,\r                                                                          \n\nsupra,  the  court adopted  the Restatement  rule  as the  law of\r               \n\nMassachusetts.  A decade later, it held that a payee  could sue a\n\ndrawer -- under   3-804   or   on  the   underlying   contractual\n\n                               -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\nobligation -- where the instrument was drawn to the plaintiff and\n\na co-payee and  the drawer  delivered the instrument  to the  co-\n\npayee, who absconded  with the  plaintiff's funds.   See GMAC  v.\r                                                                       \n\nAbington  Casualty  Insurance Co.,  supra.   In  GMAC,  the court\r                                                               \n\ndistinguished Terry v. Kemper, because that case was one in which\r                                       \n\nthe  absconding  co-payee  was  authorized by  the  plaintiff  to\r                                                    \n\nreceive the check on his behalf.  602 N.E.2d at 1087.   Thus, the\n\nSJC reasoned that there was no inconsistency between recognizing,\n\nin general, a payee's cause of action against a drawer  under  3-\n\n804, and barring such an action where the instrument is delivered\n\nto an authorized agent.\n\n          There is another, perhaps more plausible argument  that\n\n  3-116(b) and 3-404  \"displace\" the common law rule in question.\n\nSection 3-116(b),  the argument goes, requires  the signatures of\n\nboth  principal and agent where they are both named as co-payees,\n\nas in this case.  Section 3-404 provides that \"[a]ny unauthorized\n\nsignature  is wholly inoperative as that of the person whose name\n\nis signed unless he ratifies it or is precluded from denying it.\"\n\n 3-404(1).   Appellant  contends that the  forged signature  of a\n\nprincipal is \"wholly inoperative,\"  and therefore does not excuse\n\nthe  drawer from liability to the principal even after the drawer\n\npaid on the forged instrument that it delivered to the agent.\n\n               See Muzzy v.  Rockingham County  Trust\r                                                               \n            Co., 113 N.H. 520, 523, 309 A.2d 893, 895\r                         \n            (1973) (holding that where  wife, without\n            husband's authorization, signed husband's\n            indorsement on draft, the  instrument was\n            defective under both  3-404 and  3-116);\n               Morris, 517 N.E.2d at 909 (noting that\r                               \n            under   3-404  an unauthorized  signature\n\n                               -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\n            does  not relieve drawer of obligation to\n            pay payee).\nSeveral  jurisdictions that  have adopted  the Restatement  rule,\n\nhowever, have explicitly held that these sections do not displace\n\nthe rule.\n\n            See Terry, 456 N.E.2d at  467 (  3-116(b)\r                               \n            and 3-404);\n            Hutzler, 347 N.E.2d at 630-32 ( 3-404);\r                             \n            Navrides, 488 P.2d at 643-646 (  3-116(b)\r                              \n            and 3-404);\n            Clarkson, 406 F.2d at 498 (  3-116(b) and\r                              \n            3-404).\n\nIndeed,  it  might plausibly  be  argued  that  3-404  should  be\n\ninterpreted as  allowing for the possibility that  a person whose\n\nname is  forged on an instrument  by his agent is,  by his unwise\n\nselection of the agent, \"precluded from denying\" the unauthorized\n\nsignature.   See  Hutzler, 347  N.E.2d at  621 (stating  that the\r                                   \n\ncourt would,  in principle, so hold).   In any event,  all of the\n\njurisdictions that  have considered  whether that section  or  3-\n\n116,  or  both  together,  displace  the  common  law  rule  have\n\nconcluded that they do not.\n\n          We conclude  that summary  judgment for Dean  Witter is\n\nappropriate  on the ground that appellant's action is barred by a\n\nrule  of the  common law  of agency  that remains  a part  of New\n\nHampshire law after enactment  of the commercial code by  the New\n\nHampshire legislature.\n\n                               IV.\r                                         IV.\n\n          Before  the trial court,  plaintiff claimed that drawee\n\nBanks were liable to her for conversion under  3-419(1)(c), which\n\n                               -34-\r                                          34\r\r\n\ntreats an instrument as  converted when \"it  is paid on a  forged\n\nindorsement.\"  The Banks moved for summary judgment on the ground\n\nthat Fairbanks'  indorsement was valid and  sufficient to justify\n\ntheir  payment  of  the checks.    The  Banks  relied on   3-301,\n\ndefining the rights of a holder as follows:\n\n            The  holder of  an instrument  whether or\n            not  he  is  the  owner may  transfer  or\n            negotiate  it  and,  except as  otherwise\n            provided in  Section 3-603 on  payment or\n            satisfaction,  discharge  it  or  enforce\n            payment in his own name.\n\nThe  trial court agreed that Fairbanks was a holder of the checks\n\nand could  rightfully negotiate them with  his indorsement alone,\n\neven though he forged Mrs. Kenerson's indorsement.\n\n                                A.\r                                          A.\n\n          As explained in Part III.A., Fairbanks was not a holder\n\nfor the  purpose of discharge  of drawer liability  under  3-603.\r                                                  \n\nHere, the question presented  is whether Fairbanks, acting alone,\n\ncould exercise the powers  of a holder  under  3-301 in a  manner\n\nthat  would discharge drawees  of liability.   We  conclude here,\r                                       \n\nalso, that Fairbanks could not, acting alone, exercise the powers\n\nof a holder -- in  this instance for the purpose  of invoking  3-\n\n301.    See  GMAC, 602  N.E.2d  at  1087  (considering  3-301  in\r                           \n\nreasoning to the conclusion that the co-payee who took payment on\n\nan instrument not signed by the other payee was not a holder).\n\n          As explained above, this is the only reading consistent\n\nwith other applicable statutory provisions.  A holder's  power of\n\n\"negotiation\" of  an instrument  under  3-301 depends,  under  3-\n\n                               -35-\r                                          35\r\r\n\n202(1),  upon  the  holder's   having  obtained  all  \"necessary\"\n\nindorsements.   In this case, as we have already established,  3-\n\n116(b) renders  \"necessary\" the signatures of  both co-payees, in\n\ntheir fiduciary  capacities.  Indeed, to  conclude that Fairbanks\n\ncould alone  negotiate the checks under   3-301 would practically\n\nnullify  3-116(b).  The district court thus erred as  a matter of\n\nlaw in granting summary judgment for the Banks based on  3-301.\n\n          It follows, as  well, that the district court  erred to\n\nthe extent  that it relied on  Jones v. Van Norman,  522 A.2d 503\r                                                            \n\n(Pa.  1987), in holding that defendant Banks are not liable under\n\n 3-419(1)(c).   In Jones, the agent was authorized to indorse her\r                                  \n\nprincipal's name to the checks she received for her principal and\n\nto deposit them  in her  principal's bank account.   Id. at  505.\r                                                                  \n\nThe court decided that, because the indorsements were authorized,\n\nthey could not be the equivalent of forgeries for purposes of  3-\n\n419(1)(c), even though the  agent misappropriated the proceeds of\n\nthe checks.\n\n          In the present  case, the  Banks did not  argue to  the\n\ntrial  court,  or  to   this  court,  that  plaintiff  authorized\n\nFairbanks  to  indorse  the  checks; they  rely,  rather,  on  an\n\nassertion that  he had  inherent authority  to do  so.   As  just\n\nobserved, however, Fairbanks' status as copayee did not confer on\n\nhim authority to cash the checks without plaintiff's indorsement,\n\nor with a forged  indorsement purporting to be hers.   Similarly,\n\nhis  status  as attorney  and agent  of  Mrs. Kenerson  for other\n\npurposes  did not clothe him with authority to indorse the checks\n\n                               -36-\r                                          36\r\r\n\nin her name.\n\n               See Florida Bar v.

Neither, however, is sufficient to sustain summary\n\njudgment for the Banks.\n\n          The  Banks first contend  that plaintiff cannot satisfy\n\n 3-419's   requirement  that   a   payee  demonstrate   that  the\n\ninstruments in question were  delivered to her, because plaintiff\n\nnever obtained physical possession of the checks.\n\n          No New Hampshire court  has addressed the existence and\n\nscope  of the delivery requirement under  3-419(1)(c).  We do not\n\nrest our  decision on the New Hampshire legislature's revision of\n\nthe  statute, which now requires delivery to the payee before the\n\npayee can sue in conversion, see R.S.A. 382:3-420(a)(ii), because\r                                          \n\n                               -37-\r                                          37\r\r\n\nit took effect after this dispute arose.\n\n          We assume, as an initial matter, that the New Hampshire\n\nSupreme Court would find an implicit delivery requirement  in  3-\n\n419 and that  it would recognize  \"constructive delivery.\"   Most\n\njurisdictions  hold   that  a  payee  cannot   recover  from  the\n\ncollecting  bank that pays on  a forged indorsement  if the check\n\nwas never delivered to the payee.

The  Code expressly  provides  for a\n\nnegligence defense in defined circumstances:\n\n            Any   person   who   by  his   negligence\n            substantially  contributes to  a material\n            alteration  of the  instrument or  to the\n            making  of  an unauthorized  signature is\n            precluded  from asserting  the alteration\n            or  lack of  authority  . . .  against  a\n            drawee  or  other   payee  who  pays  the\n            instrument   in   good   faith   and   in\n            accordance with the reasonable commercial\n            standards  of  the  drawee's  or  payor's\n            business.\n\nR.S.A. 382-A:3-406.\n\n          The  proffer  of evidence  before  the  trial court  by\n\nappellee  Banks in support  of their motion  for summary judgment\n\nfell  short of meeting their burden of showing that no reasonable\n\nfactfinder  could find  that  they  had  failed  to  prove  by  a\n\npreponderance of  the evidence  that plaintiff was  negligent and\n\nthat her  negligence  \"substantially contribute[d]  . . . to  the\n\nmaking of an unauthorized signature.\"\n\n          We do not address what  are the appropriate elements of\n\na  defense  under   3-406  because  that  is  a  question  better\n\naddressed in the first  instance by the trial court, to  which we\n\nremand for reasons explained below.\n\n                                D.\r                                          D.\n\n          Appellee   Banks  assert  that   summary  judgment  for\n\n                               -42-\r                                          42\r\r\n\nappellant is  inappropriate even if all legal  issues are decided\n\nin her favor.   The Banks have failed  to identify precisely  any\n\ndisputed  fact that  is material  to plaintiff's  claim.   We are\n\nconcerned, however, that the trial court's erroneous allowance of\n\nthe  Banks'  motion  for  summary judgment  may  have  distracted\n\nattention  from the fact that if  the Banks wanted to press their\n\ncontention, in the alternative, that the  3-406 defense should go\n\nto  the  factfinder, the  Banks  were  entitled  to a  reasonable\n\nopportunity to proffer evidence that would support such a finding\n\nof fact.  On the record before us, it is not clear that the Banks\n\nwere  appropriately  notified  that  summary  judgment  might  be\n\nentered  against  them as  to this  defense  absent a  proffer of\n\nadmissible  evidence to show the  existence of a material dispute\n\nof fact  on this issue.   Thus, we will vacate  the trial court's\n\nrulings  on the  cross-motions  for summary  judgment  as to  the\n\nBanks' liability and remand for such further proceedings, if any,\n\nas the  district court  deems appropriate before  entry of  final\n\njudgment.\n\n          The judgment  of the district court for  Dean Witter is\n\naffirmed.\r                  \n\n          The  judgment of  the district  court  awarding summary\n\njudgment  for   Morgan  Guaranty   Trust  Company  and   Bank  of\n\nCalifornia, N.A.,  and denying  plaintiff summary judgment  as to\n\nliability  against those  parties,  is  vacated.

The attorney, however, is not a party.  Rather, the widow, appellant Jean Kenerson, suing in her capacity as administratrix of her deceased husband's estate, seeks to recoup her losses from the institution (\"Dean Witter\") that wrote the checks and the banks on which they were drawn.  We use \"plaintiff\" (or \"appellant\") to refer to Mrs. Kenerson in her capacity as currently the administratrix and formerly co-administrator with the attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court granted motions for summary judgment for all defendants.  We affirm the judgment for Dean Witter, but vacate the judgment for other defendants and remand for such further proceedings, consistent with this Opinion, as may be necessary to final disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One week after the death of Vaughan H. Kenerson in July 1981, the Sullivan County Probate Court appointed Jean R. Kenerson and John C. Fairbanks as co-administrators of his Estate.  Mrs. Kenerson, having limited experience in financial matters, including estate administration and investments, relied on Fairbanks' legal and investment counsel.  She took little, if any, role in the Estate administration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1981, Fairbanks opened an Estate checking account at First Citizens National Bank, listing himself as the sole authorized signatory.  He also maintained a trust account for his law offices at the same bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1981, Fairbanks opened an account for the Estate with Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., into which he placed stock holdings of the Estate valued at $248,660.87.  Fairbanks did not inform Mrs. Kenerson of the existence of the Dean Witter account or of his withdrawals from it, totalling $255,978.38 between November 1981 and the closing of the account in October 1984.  Fairbanks received the withdrawals in the form of checks that were mailed to him.  Most of the checks were issued in the following manner:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Pay to the order of</p>\n    <p>Estate of Vaughan H. Kenerson</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>Jean R. Kenerson &amp;</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>John C. Fairbanks Administrators</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On some checks, however, \"Admin\" instead of \"Administrators\" appeared on the last line.  The checks were drawn on Dean Witter's accounts at Morgan Guaranty Trust Company and Bank of California.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fairbanks deposited one of the Dean Witter checks, in the amount of $150,000, in his own account at First Citizens National Bank.  He deposited the other checks in the Estate checking account that he had opened at First Citizens National Bank.  Fairbanks indorsed these checks by writing first his own name (without any description of his role), followed by the name of Mrs. Kenerson.  No evidence was offered at trial that Mrs. Kenerson had ever affirmatively authorized Fairbanks to indorse any checks in her name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In each instance, First Citizens National Bank, the depository bank, accepted the check and transmitted it to the drawee bank--Morgan Guaranty Trust or Bank of California (\"Banks\")--and the drawee bank paid the check.  Though the record is not explicit, the parties appear to have assumed, and we take it to be undisputed, that in each instance the drawee bank charged Dean Witter's account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fairbanks withdrew from the Estate bank account, for his own benefit, all but a small portion of the funds in that account.  Mrs. Kenerson acknowledged receiving only $20,000.  In any event, appellees do not contend that she received any more than $66,000.  Beyond this sum, little if any of the remaining funds from the Estate account with First Citizens National Bank were disbursed in any way that inured to Mrs. Kenerson's benefit, either individually or in her capacity as co-administrator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff did not sue the most obvious target, Fairbanks;  he had disappeared.  Instead she sued Dean Witter, drawer of the checks, and Morgan Guaranty Trust and Bank of California, drawees (or payors) of the checks.  (Plaintiff initially sued the depositor bank, too, but claims against the F.D.I.C., as that bank's successor in interest, were dismissed by stipulation.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff sued Dean Witter on the theory that it was still liable to her on the checks because she had received only a small portion of their value and, in her capacity as co-administrator and later sole administratrix, was entitled to recover a sum equal to the remainder of the full value.  She sued the drawee Banks on the theory that they had converted the proceeds of the checks when they paid them over the forged indorsements of her name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff sued all defendants--the drawer (Dean Witter) and drawees (the Banks)--on two different theories.  The trial court, in granting summary judgment to all defendants, relied, essentially, on one proposition--that under the U.C.C.  (as enacted in New Hampshire) and the common law (as developed in New Hampshire) all defendants were entitled to rely on Fairbanks' indorsement when paying on the checks he forged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court read the checks as payable to the Estate.  Based on this reading, the court concluded that Fairbanks' negotiation of the checks--by his own indorsement and the forged indorsement in plaintiff's name--absolved defendants of liability to plaintiff.  We conclude that the trial court's reasoning rested on an impermissible reading of the checks and that the rules of law invoked by the trial court do not apply to the checks at issue in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume, without deciding, that, in general, a determination as to who are the payees of an instrument may be one of fact if on the evidence received, under the applicable law, reasonable finders of fact could differ.  Cf. Feldman Construction Co. v. Union Bank, 28 Cal.App.3d 731, 104 Cal.Rptr. 912, 913 (1972) (referring to \"trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law that the check was payable jointly to two payees and required the endorsement of both\").  We agree with the district court that, on the evidence before the court in this case, factfinders can not reasonably differ as to the proper reading of the instruments at issue, and therefore the determination of the meaning of those instruments must be made by the court \"as a matter of law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the determination of the trial court, however, we conclude that the only reasonable construction of the checks at issue in this case is that they were payable to plaintiff and Fairbanks together (that is, collectively) as payees, in their capacities as administrators of the Estate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we explain more fully below, under the statute and the applicable precedents, a check payable to two persons together (as distinguished from a check payable in the alternative, to either of two persons) can properly be negotiated only on the valid indorsements of both payees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, as explained in Parts III and IV below, because Fairbanks had authority to receive the checks, even though he did not have authority to indorse them with plaintiff's signature and then negotiate them, summary judgment for drawer Dean Witter was appropriate, given that the Banks paid the checks and charged Dean Witter's account.  This rule as to the drawer's discharge applies even when the payment is on a forged indorsement.  It is, however, a rule as to a drawer's liability and does not apply to drawees.  For this and other reasons, explained below, we vacate summary judgment for appellee Banks and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff sued Dean Witter, drawer of the checks, on the ground that Dean Witter was liable to her on the instruments themselves.  She brought her suit against Dean Witter under New Hampshire R.S.A. 382-A:3-804, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>The owner of an instrument which is lost, whether by destruction, theft or otherwise, may maintain an action in his own name and recover from any party liable thereon upon due proof of his ownership, the facts which prevent his production of the instrument and its terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dean Witter did not dispute that plaintiff properly framed her action under this section.

See Salve Regina College v. Russell, 499 U.S. 225, 239, 111 S.Ct. 1217, 1225, 113 L.Ed.2d 190 (1991) (courts of appeals must review state-law determinations of district courts de novo).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New Hampshire courts have not explicitly considered which U.C.C. provisions apply to instruments drafted precisely in the manner of the instruments in this case.  Thus, in construing Sec. 3-603, as well as other statutes referred to later in this Opinion, we do not have the benefit of direct guidance from New Hampshire case law.  We are guided, however, by principles of statutory interpretation that are well settled in New Hampshire law.  We begin by considering the words of the statute, and on the assumption \"that all words in [the] statute were meant to be given meaning in the interpretation of the statute,\" Town of Wolfeboro v. Smith, 131 N.H. 449, 556 A.2d 755, 756-57 (1989).  We take account also of our obligation to determine manifested meaning of a statute \"from its construction as a whole, not by examining isolated words and phrases.\"  Petition of Jane Doe, 132 N.H. 270, 564 A.2d 433, 438 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, in light of various provisions of the statute taken together, that payment to Fairbanks was not \"payment ... to the holder\" for purposes of Sec. 3-603.  Nonetheless, Fairbanks was an agent of plaintiff for some purposes, and was authorized to receive the checks on her behalf;  therefore, under a rule of the common law that was not abrogated by enactment of the U.C.C. in New Hampshire, Dean Witter's delivery of the checks to Fairbanks, followed by the payment of the checks through the Banks, absolved Dean Witter of liability on the instruments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all relevant respects, the New Hampshire statute mirrors precisely the Uniform Commercial Code.  Our citations will be primarily to the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated.  References to the statute in the text of this Opinion, however, will be by section number alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The New Hampshire statute, as well as the Uniform Commercial Code on which it is based, defines a \"holder\" as a person who is in possession of an instrument drawn, issued, or indorsed to him or to his order.  R.S.A. 382-A:1-201(20).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  A holder of an instrument has the power to negotiate or transfer it, or to discharge the instrument or enforce payment on it in his own name.  R.S.A. 382-A:3-301.  Negotiation is the transfer of an instrument in such form that the transferee becomes a holder.  R.S.A. 382-A:3-202(1).  Negotiation of an instrument that is payable to the order of specific persons is accomplished by delivery of the instrument with all the necessary indorsements.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that Fairbanks was in possession of the checks, and that the checks were drawn to him in his capacity as administrator.  They were not drawn to him alone, however, but to him and plaintiff together in their capacities as administrators.  Neither co-administrator, acting on his or her own, could negotiate the checks.  Rather, the indorsements of both administrators were \"necessary,\" as that term is used in Sec. 3-202(1), to \"negotiate[ ]\" the checks as that term is used in Sec. 3-116(b), according to which an instrument payable to two or more persons, if not in the alternative, is payable to all of them together and may be \"negotiated\" only by all of them.  Plaintiff never indorsed the checks.  Thus, Fairbanks did not properly negotiate the checks when he signed his indorsement, forged the indorsement of plaintiff, and delivered the checks to the depository bank.  Consequently, Dean Witter's payment to Fairbanks on those checks did not constitute the \"payment ... to the holder\" that results in discharge of a drawer's liability under Sec. 3-603.  To conclude otherwise would be entirely inconsistent with Sec. 3-116(b), under which, as stated in a comment, \"the rights of one [co-payee] are not discharged without his consent by the act of the other [co-payee].\"  See R.S.A. 382-A:3-116, comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not, and do not, decide whether Fairbanks was a holder for any other purpose contemplated by the statute.  Rather, we decide only that, in the circumstances of this case, under Sec. 3-603 Fairbanks was not a holder for the purpose of discharge of Dean Witter's liability when he received Dean Witter's payment through the drawee Banks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, because the checks were not properly negotiated by Fairbanks, the depository bank did not become a holder of the checks when Fairbanks delivered them to the bank.  See R.S.A. 382-A:3-202(1).  Thus, Dean Witter's payment to the depository bank, through the drawee banks, also did not constitute payment to a holder under Sec. 3-603.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated above, we conclude that the checks in this case were payable to the co-administrators together.  It is true that the manner in which the checks were written is not one that falls squarely within an explicit provision of the statute.  In these circumstances, we examine hypothetical variations, at least some of which are explicitly referred to in the statute.  We do so with the purpose of considering which, among our hypothetical instruments, the instruments at issue here most closely resemble.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Suppose, first, the checks had been made payable to \"Estate of Vaughan H. Kenerson,\" without more.  It might plausibly have been argued that under Sec. 3-110(1)(e) the indorsement of either of the co-administrators (that is, Fairbanks as administrator or Mrs. Kenerson as administrator) would have discharged drawer liability under Sec. 3-603.  Another, and probably more reasonable, interpretation of the statute is that a check drafted in this manner would be payable to all of the representatives together, in the absence of an explicit authorization in fact or in some source of law outside the U.C.C. for each to act alone;  but we need not and do not decide this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court applied Sec. 3-110(1)(e) to the checks in this case, as if they had been drawn only to \"Estate of Vaughan H. Kenerson.\"   Since Fairbanks was a representative of the Estate, the court reasoned, the checks were payable to him under Sec. 3-110(1)(e).  As we have stated above and explain further below, however, on the record in this case, the application of Sec. 3-110(1)(e) to these checks was erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Suppose, second, the checks had been made payable to \"John C. Fairbanks &amp; Jean R. Kenerson.\"   Then the indorsements of both in their individual capacities would have been required to negotiate the checks under Sec. 3-116(b).  See R.S.A. 382-A:3-116(b) &amp; comment.  According to that provision, an instrument payable to two or more persons, if not in the alternative, is payable to all of them (\"together,\" one may say) and may be negotiated only by all of them (\"together\").  See, e.g., Litchfield v. Pfeffer, 116 N.H. 485, 487-88, 363 A.2d 413, 415 (1976) (holding that trial court properly found under Sec. 3-116(b) that notes payable to \"Roy F. Litchfield and Gloria B. Litchfield or order\" could be discharged only by both of them).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, suppose the checks had been made payable to \"John C. Fairbanks &amp; Jean R. Kenerson, Administrators of the Estate of Vaughan H. Kenerson.\"   Then the checks would have been payable to the named fiduciaries, according to Sec. 3-117(b), which provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>[a]n instrument made payable to a named person with the addition of words describing him ... as any ... fiduciary [other than an agent or officer of a specified person] is payable to the payee and may be negotiated ... by him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See also R.S.A. 382-A:3-117(b), comment 2 (providing example of \"John Doe, Administrator of the Estate of Richard Roe\").  In this third type of case, in which the checks are payable to both but in their fiduciary capacities, under Sec. 3-116(b) the indorsements of both in their fiduciary capacities would be required to negotiate the checks.  Accordingly, the indorsements of both in their fiduciary capacities would be necessary to invoke Sec. 3-603 to relieve the drawer of liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Persons,\" as the term is used in Sec. 3-116 and elsewhere in the statute, does not mean only \"natural persons.\"   This common sense interpretation of \"persons\" is reinforced by a statutory definition.  R.S.A. 382-A:1-201(30) (defining person as including \"individual\" or \"organization\").  It is further reinforced by usage elsewhere in the statute and in judicial opinions.  See R.S.A. 382-A:3-110(1)(e) (listing \"an estate, trust or fund\" as possible \"person[s]\" that could qualify as payees);  see also Equipment Distributors v. Charter Oak Bank, 34 Conn.Sup. 606, 379 A.2d 682 (App.Sess.1977) (two business entities);  Alumax Aluminum Corp. v. Norstar Bank, N.A., 168 A.D.2d 163, 572 N.Y.S.2d 133 (4 Dept.1991) (same).  Thus, \"persons\" includes corporate fiduciaries and natural persons in their fiduciary capacities, as well as natural persons individually.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The checks in this case appear most like those in the third of the categories described above.  Except for the few instances in which the word \"Administrators\" was abbreviated to \"Admin,\" the checks were made payable to the order of:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Estate of Vaughan H. Kenerson</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>Jean R. Kenerson &amp;</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>John C. Fairbanks Administrators</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the sequence of names on all the checks in this case is the reverse of the sequence in the third hypothetical category described above, in which the administrators were named first and the estate afterward.  Appellees urge that we attach great significance to this difference in sequence.  They contend that it was proper for the trial court to apply Sec. 3-110(1)(e) because the Estate appears first in the sequence.  We do not interpret the statute as supporting this contention, and appellees do not cite a single case that suggests we should.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A more reasonable interpretation is that Sec. 3-110(1)(e) is directed to cases in which the name of the estate is the only name to appear.  Comment 2 to Sec. 3-110 makes this point clear:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>2.  Paragraph (e) of subsection (1) is intended to change the result of decisions which have held that an instrument payable to the order of the estate of a decedent was payable to bearer....  The intent in such cases is obviously not to make the instrument payable to bearer, but to the order of the representative of the estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">R.S.A. 382-A:3-110, comment 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees also contend that the checks in this case should be subject to Sec. 3-110(1)(e) because the name of the Estate appears alone on the first line and is not connected by \"and\" or \"or\" to the names of its administrators.  For several reasons, the argument is not persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, one would not expect to see \"and\" or \"or\" linking the name of an estate with its administrators because the addition of such language would ordinarily be both unnecessary and confusing.  Accordingly, we decline to adopt, as an alternative reading of the checks, either (1) that they were payable to the Estate and Mrs. Kenerson and Fairbanks, or (2) that they were payable to the Estate or Mrs. Kenerson or Fairbanks.  Nor does the absence of punctuation (whether a comma or a semicolon) between the first and second lines, strengthen significantly the argument for some alternative reading.  Placing the name of the first named administrator on a separate line, below the line on which the name of the Estate appeared and above the line on which \"John C. Fairbanks Administrators\" appeared, conveyed the message that she and the individual named on the next line, with \" &amp; \" between them, were named as administrators and not as individuals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we need not explore whether it would make a difference if Jean R. Kenerson had been named individually as a payee.  She was not so named.  Even the checks on which \"Admin\" rather than \"Administrators\" appeared are not subject to interpretation as naming her in her individual capacity.  That reading is rebutted by the sequence in which the names appear--on the first line, the Estate;  on the second line, \"Jean R. Kenerson\";  and on the third line, \"John C. Fairbanks Admin.\"   If only Fairbanks were being named as administrator, common sense would reject the use of a sequence in which his name and designation as administrator were separated from the name of the estate by the name of another payee who was meant to be named only individually.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, if we were to adopt the proposed interpretation of the statute, the result would be to give no effect to the drawer's manifested intent in naming the individuals as administrators only and not as individuals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all these reasons, we conclude that Sec. 3-110(1)(e) does not apply to this case.  Thus, the trial court erred when it read the checks as instruments controlled by Sec. 3-110(1)(e) rather than instruments controlled by Sec. 3-116(b) and Sec. 3-117(b).  These sections together made plaintiff's indorsement essential to the proper negotiation of the checks under Sec. 3-202(1).  Absent proper negotiation, payment to Fairbanks was not \"payment ... to the holder\" under Sec. 3-603.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion derived from the text of the statute itself, absent New Hampshire case law in point, is confirmed by our examination of interpretations of the U.C.C. by the courts of other states and a respected commentator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A recent decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court is closely analogous.  In GMAC v. Abington Casualty Insurance Co., 413 Mass. 583, 602 N.E.2d 1085 (1992), the defendant issued to an individual a physical damage insurance policy covering a motor vehicle that the individual had purchased.  Plaintiff GMAC was the holder of a security interest in the vehicle and was a loss payee beneficiary of that policy.  When the vehicle sustained damage, defendant Abington issued a check payable to the order of the individual and GMAC.  The check was delivered to the individual, who presented it to the drawee bank without GMAC's indorsement;  the individual received full payment, and GMAC received none of the proceeds.  The Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") held that the payee, GMAC, could proceed against the drawer on the underlying contract claim, or under Sec. 3-804.  Id. 602 N.E.2d at 1088-89.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC specifically observed that suit under Sec. 3-804 was not barred by Sec. 3-603 because the individual who cashed the check without GMAC's indorsement \"was never a holder of the check.\"  Id. 602 N.E.2d at 1089.   Since GMAC was named as a co-payee, according to Sec. 3-116(b) the check could not be discharged by the individual payee acting alone.  Id. 602 N.E.2d at 1087-88.   The SJC also relied on Sec. 3-603, observing that without GMAC's indorsement, the purchaser of the vehicle could not have taken the check by negotiation and thus did not become a holder under Sec. 3-202(1).  Id. 602 N.E.2d at 1088.   Without payment to a holder, the liability of defendant was not discharged under Sec. 3-603.  Id.  In relation to this issue, the case before us is in all material respects like GMAC v. Abington, though different in details not material to this issue.  It is true that the SJC observed that GMAC and Abington were \"not in an agency relationship,\" id. 602 N.E.2d at 1087, and appellees in this case have argued that Fairbanks was an agent for plaintiff.  We hold, however, that in the absence of any evidence that plaintiff actually or apparently authorized Fairbanks to indorse and negotiate checks on her behalf, he was not an agent for indorsing and negotiating the Dean Witter checks.  Thus, the present case, like GMAC v. Abington, is one in which for these purposes the payees were \"not in an agency relationship.\"  Id. 602 N.E.2d at 1087.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other but closely analogous circumstances, courts and commentators have adopted the same reasoning and come to the same conclusion as we do, namely, that payment on a missing or forged indorsement does not discharge a party from liability.  White and Summers address, for example, the situation in which a thief, rather than a co-payee, steals order paper and forges the payee's indorsement.  The thief who steals order paper cannot qualify as a holder, and the thief's signature is not an indorsement.  White &amp; Summers, 680 n. 7.  Subsequent takers, also, will not be holders.  Id. at 680.  Thus, when the drawee or maker pays the presenter, the payor will not have paid a holder, no discharge under Sec. 3-603 will have occurred, and the original owner can recover on the stolen instrument under Sec. 3-804 or on the underlying obligation.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same result holds where an indorsement is missing, rather than forged.  In a suit by the drawee bank against the collecting bank for accepting a check with a missing indorsement, a California appeals court noted that \"[w]hen a check is made payable to two payees jointly, only proper negotiation, i.e., endorsement by both, results in the payment contemplated\" by Sec. 3-603.  Feldman Construction Co. v. Union Bank, 28 Cal.App.3d 731, 104 Cal.Rptr. 912, 914 (1972).  That court also relied on Sec. 3-201, defining a holder, and Sec. 3-202, defining proper negotiation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be suggested that cases holding that a co-payee who absconds with funds is not a holder appear to be inconsistent with Sec. 3-603's reference to a \"party who in bad faith pays or satisfies a holder who acquires the instrument by theft or who ... holds through one who so acquired it.\"   R.S.A. 382-A:3-603(1)(a) (emphasis added).  The meaning of holder as it is used in this instance, appears, however, to be a deviation from the definition of the term in Sec. 1-201(20).  Reading Sec. 3-603 together with Secs. 1-201(20), 3-202(1), and 3-116(b), one is driven to the conclusion that payment to a thief does not constitute payment to a holder for the purpose of discharge under Sec. 3-603.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court also relied on Protective Check Writer Co. v. Collins, 92 N.H. 27, 23 A.2d 770 (1942), interpreting that opinion as standing for the unqualified proposition (referred to here as the \"single-entity rule\") that the acts of one co-representative of an estate--namely, Fairbanks--are treated in law as the acts of the other--namely, plaintiff.  It is unclear whether the trial court, in its citation to the single-entity rule, meant that only Fairbanks' signature was necessary to negotiate the checks, or instead meant that under this rule Fairbanks was authorized to sign the indorsement of his co-administrator, plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the trial court meant the former, we have already rejected the argument that under New Hampshire law Dean Witter was relieved of liability by paying on only one effective indorsement where two were required.  Even if Protective Check Writer can properly be interpreted as standing for the proposition that fewer than all co-administrators may negotiate an instrument made payable to all of them together--and we do not decide whether it does--it would be displaced by the provisions of the later-enacted statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the trial court relied on Protective Check Writer for the proposition that Fairbanks, as administrator, was authorized in law to sign the indorsement of plaintiff, his co-administrator, we conclude that the statute displaces that purported rule also, even if we assume it did exist (in the form assumed by the trial judge) in earlier New Hampshire law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In analyzing the relationship between the statute and the common law that existed before its enactment, we start with not only the guidance of Town of Wolfeboro and Petition of Jane Doe, supra, but as well the legislative mandate that \"unless displaced by the particular provisions of this chapter the principles of law and equity ... shall supplement its provisions.\"   See R.S.A. 382-A:1-103.  Construing sections of the statute in combination, as we must under Petition of Jane Doe, we conclude that Secs. 3-116(b) and 3-117(b) leave no room for operation of the single-entity rule regarding commercial instruments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute is premised on an assumption that an instrument may be made payable to an estate, see R.S.A. 382-A:3-110(1)(e), or its fiduciaries, see R.S.A. 382-A:3-117(b).  Although both clauses are worded in the singular (\"representative\" in Sec. 3-110(1)(e), \"named person\" in Sec. 3-117(b)), and the illustrations in the comment to Sec. 3-117(b) include only one fiduciary, words in the singular number include the plural.  See R.S.A. 382-A:1-102(5)(a).  We need not decide, and do not decide, whether, under Sec. 3-110(1)(e) and other relevant provisions, a check made payable to an estate alone can be negotiated on the indorsement of just one of its administrators.  Where, however, a check is payable to two named administrators, not in the alternative, Sec. 3-116(b) declares that the instrument is payable to the two fiduciaries together, and is negotiable only by the two together.  It would render Sec. 3-116(b) a nullity, at least with respect to checks made payable to co-administrators of estates, to hold that one of two or more co-administrators can, as a matter of law, sign the indorsements of fellow administrators and proceed to negotiate what is \"negotiable only by all of them.\"   Thus, Sec. 3-117(b) and Sec. 3-116(b), considered together, displace the common law single-entity rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees rely on a commentator's suggestion that the problem of who can indorse an instrument made payable to several administrators \"will depend, as it did under prior law, on whether one personal representative has authority to act on behalf of the others....\"  See Anderson, UCC 3d Sec. 3-116:31.  His premise, that \"[t]he Code makes no provision in this respect,\" however, is subject to question.  Perhaps it may be said that the Code does not do so in any single provision.  But the Code, as just noted, explicitly allows for instruments payable to several persons together, and we see no reason not to apply Sec. 3-116 when the \"persons\" are individuals named in their capacity as fiduciaries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rules of construction stated in the statute itself further strengthen this interpretation.  The statute declares that it is to be \"liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies.\"   R.S.A. 382-A:1-102(1).  One purpose of the statute is to \"simplify, clarify and modernize the law governing commercial transactions.\"   R.S.A. 382-A:1-102(2)(a).  Appellees have offered no reason to infer that, due to policy considerations unique to the administration of estates, either the drafters of the U.C.C. or state legislatures (including that of New Hampshire), in proposing and adopting Secs. 3-116(b) and 3-117(b), manifested an intent to leave intact a common law single-entity rule, in those states where it existed or where no precedent existed one way or the other.  Furthermore, though some recent cases in other jurisdictions continue to cite the single-entity rule, see, e.g., Holmes v. Lankenau Hospital, 426 Pa.Super. 452, 627 A.2d 763, 768 (1993), a growing body of authority in the field of probate law (even if still a minority) rejects the rule.  See Unif.  Probate Code Sec. 3-717, 8 U.L.A. 340 (1983) (\"If two or more persons are appointed co-representatives and unless the will provides otherwise, the concurrence of all is required on all acts connected with the administration and distribution of the estate.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that the statute should be read as not preserving any purportedly pre-existing single-entity rule is further supported by the lack of any showing that this rule was ever firmly embedded in New Hampshire law.  Appellees cite only one New Hampshire case, Protective Check Writer, supra, in support of their contention that the single-entity rule was and is now a part of New Hampshire law.  The cited passage from Protective Check Writer, however, is a passing reference, not essential to the basis of the decision, without citation to any other case, either in New Hampshire or elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reference to the single-entity rule in the Protective Check Writer opinion was made in the process of explaining the holding that each co-representative of an estate is liable for his or her own wrongdoing.  23 A.2d at 772.   The court thus had no reason to be concerned with the very different question whether one co-representative has authority to bind the estate by action taken without the approval or even knowledge of the other.  Moreover, the opinion in that case explicitly called attention to the fact that (1) \"both administrators [in that case] were equally participants\" in the transaction at issue, 23 A.2d at 772 (\"making payments\"), and (2) the issue before the court \"was only the chargeability of Mrs. Ney, leaving [the chargeability] of her co-administrator undetermined.\"  Id.  We conclude that Protective Check Writer does not support the proposition for which appellees cite it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees suggested in oral argument that the lack of reported New Hampshire cases regarding the single-entity rule indicates that the rule was so taken for granted by the New Hampshire bar that it was not the subject of litigation, or, more precisely, litigation that culminated in a reported opinion.  The suggestion is unpersuasive in view of divided authority elsewhere and the interest litigants would have in presenting the issue in any case where it would be likely to affect the outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even if we were to assume, for the sake of argument, that New Hampshire had adopted the single-entity rule at a time before the New Hampshire legislature enacted the commercial code, this case falls within one of the \"equitable exceptions\" to the rule to which the opinion in Protective Check Writer referred.  See id., 23 A.2d at 772.   Because the rule itself was not in issue, the court did not explain what these exceptions might be.  The equities in the case before us would weigh strongly toward recognition of an exception, even if the single-entity rule were assumed to be part of the current law of New Hampshire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that we cannot determine that under the law of New Hampshire the trial court summary judgment for Dean Witter can be sustained on the basis of Sec. 3-603 and Protective Check Writer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though payment to Fairbanks was not payment to a \"holder\" for purposes of Sec. 3-603, we conclude that Dean Witter is relieved of liability by a common law rule of agency that, we conclude, has been and continues to be part of the law of New Hampshire as in other jurisdictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the Restatement (Second) of Agency,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p>If an agent who is authorized to receive a check payable to the principal as conditional payment forges the principal's endorsement to such a check, the maker is relieved of liability to the principal if the drawee bank pays the check and charges the amount to the maker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Second) of Agency Sec. 178(2) (1958).

No reported New Hampshire case has considered this rule.  The modern trend in other jurisdictions, however, is consistent with the Restatement.

Daniel E. Murray, Joint Payee Checks--Forged and Missing Endorsements, 78 Comm.Law J. 393, 399 (1973).  Section 3-804, it is true, allows a cause of action to be maintained by a payee against a drawer even when the payee does not qualify as a holder.  Operation of that section, however, is based on the stated premise that the defendant drawer of the instrument is \"liable thereon.\"   Thus, Sec. 3-804 does not \"displace\" common law rules, such as the rule of agency at issue here, that are relevant to determining the liability of the drawer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has explicitly come to the same conclusion.  In Terry v. Kemper, supra, the court adopted the Restatement rule as the law of Massachusetts.  A decade later, it held that a payee could sue a drawer--under Sec. 3-804 or on the underlying contractual obligation--where the instrument was drawn to the plaintiff and a co-payee and the drawer delivered the instrument to the co-payee, who absconded with the plaintiff's funds.  See GMAC v. Abington Casualty Insurance Co., supra.   In GMAC, the court distinguished Terry v. Kemper, because that case was one in which the absconding co-payee was authorized by the plaintiff to receive the check on his behalf.  602 N.E.2d at 1087.   Thus, the SJC reasoned that there was no inconsistency between recognizing, in general, a payee's cause of action against a drawer under Sec. 3-804, and barring such an action where the instrument is delivered to an authorized agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is another, perhaps more plausible argument that Secs. 3-116(b) and 3-404 \"displace\" the common law rule in question.  Section 3-116(b), the argument goes, requires the signatures of both principal and agent where they are both named as co-payees, as in this case.  Section 3-404 provides that \"[a]ny unauthorized signature is wholly inoperative as that of the person whose name is signed unless he ratifies it or is precluded from denying it.\"  Sec.  3-404(1).  Appellant contends that the forged signature of a principal is \"wholly inoperative,\" and therefore does not excuse the drawer from liability to the principal even after the drawer paid on the forged instrument that it delivered to the agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Muzzy v.

The Banks relied on Sec. 3-301, defining the rights of a holder as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p>The holder of an instrument whether or not he is the owner may transfer or negotiate it and, except as otherwise provided in Section 3-603 on payment or satisfaction, discharge it or enforce payment in his own name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court agreed that Fairbanks was a holder of the checks and could rightfully negotiate them with his indorsement alone, even though he forged Mrs. Kenerson's indorsement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As explained in Part III.A., Fairbanks was not a holder for the purpose of discharge of drawer liability under Sec. 3-603.  Here, the question presented is whether Fairbanks, acting alone, could exercise the powers of a holder under Sec. 3-301 in a manner that would discharge drawees of liability.  We conclude here, also, that Fairbanks could not, acting alone, exercise the powers of a holder--in this instance for the purpose of invoking Sec. 3-301.  See GMAC, 602 N.E.2d at 1087 (considering Sec. 3-301 in reasoning to the conclusion that the co-payee who took payment on an instrument not signed by the other payee was not a holder).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As explained above, this is the only reading consistent with other applicable statutory provisions.  A holder's power of \"negotiation\" of an instrument under Sec. 3-301 depends, under Sec. 3-202(1), upon the holder's having obtained all \"necessary\" indorsements.  In this case, as we have already established, Sec. 3-116(b) renders \"necessary\" the signatures of both co-payees, in their fiduciary capacities.  Indeed, to conclude that Fairbanks could alone negotiate the checks under Sec. 3-301 would practically nullify Sec. 3-116(b).  The district court thus erred as a matter of law in granting summary judgment for the Banks based on Sec. 3-301.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows, as well, that the district court erred to the extent that it relied on Jones v. Van Norman, 513 Pa. 572, 522 A.2d 503 (1987), in holding that defendant Banks are not liable under Sec. 3-419(1)(c).  In Jones, the agent was authorized to indorse her principal's name to the checks she received for her principal and to deposit them in her principal's bank account.  Id. 522 A.2d at 505.   The court decided that, because the indorsements were authorized, they could not be the equivalent of forgeries for purposes of Sec. 3-419(1)(c), even though the agent misappropriated the proceeds of the checks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, the Banks did not argue to the trial court, or to this court, that plaintiff authorized Fairbanks to indorse the checks;  they rely, rather, on an assertion that he had inherent authority to do so.  As just observed, however, Fairbanks' status as copayee did not confer on him authority to cash the checks without plaintiff's indorsement, or with a forged indorsement purporting to be hers.  Similarly, his status as attorney and agent of Mrs. Kenerson for other purposes did not clothe him with authority to indorse the checks in her name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Florida Bar v. Allstate Insurance Co., 391 So.2d 238, 240 (Fla.App.1981) (adopting, in action for conversion where attorney forged client's indorsement on settlement check, the \"majority\" rule that an attorney specifically authorized to compromise a claim and collect the proceeds may not indorse the client's name on a check or draft tendered to effect the settlement);</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morris v.

Consequently, Jones v. Norman is inapposite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee Banks offer two alternative grounds for concluding that appellant cannot maintain a suit for conversion under Sec. 3-419.  Neither, however, is sufficient to sustain summary judgment for the Banks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Banks first contend that plaintiff cannot satisfy Sec. 3-419's requirement that a payee demonstrate that the instruments in question were delivered to her, because plaintiff never obtained physical possession of the checks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No New Hampshire court has addressed the existence and scope of the delivery requirement under Sec. 3-419(1)(c).  We do not rest our decision on the New Hampshire legislature's revision of the statute, which now requires delivery to the payee before the payee can sue in conversion, see R.S.A. 382-A:3-420(a)(ii), because it took effect after this dispute arose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume, as an initial matter, that the New Hampshire Supreme Court would find an implicit delivery requirement in Sec. 3-419 and that it would recognize \"constructive delivery.\"   Most jurisdictions hold that a payee cannot recover from the collecting bank that pays on a forged indorsement if the check was never delivered to the payee.  Papex Intern. Brokers v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 821 F.2d 883, 885 (1st Cir.1987).  Papex and other decisions cited by defendant drawees concern the collecting bank's liability in conversion rather than the drawee bank's liability in conversion;  however, this difference seems unlikely to be material to a delivery requirement.  In any event, appellant concedes in her reply brief that the delivery requirement applies to suits against drawees as well and we assume, without deciding, that this is an accurate statement of New Hampshire law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some courts recognize a constructive delivery where an intended delivery is thwarted, but a premise of invoking this rule is a showing, at minimum, that the drawer surrendered the instrument to the power of the payee or to some third person for the payee's use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 886;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">see also Lincoln Nat.

It is undisputed that plaintiff did not physically receive the checks, and the appellees also maintain that delivery to Fairbanks did not constitute constructive delivery to her.  They insist, in particular, that appellant is foreclosed from arguing constructive delivery because such an argument contradicts her other contention that Fairbanks was not her agent with respect to negotiating the checks;  and that, as a matter of law, delivery to the forger is not sufficient for Sec. 3-419.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant responds that physical delivery of the checks to Fairbanks, the forger, amounted to constructive delivery to her on two grounds--that he was a co-payee of the checks, and that he was authorized as her attorney to receive them for her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that appellant has the better of the Banks on this question.  It has already been established in an earlier portion of this opinion that Mrs. Kenerson and Fairbanks were co-payees in their capacity as co-administrators.  Appellant conceded in another context, moreover, see supra, that Fairbanks was authorized to receive checks on her behalf, even though he was not authorized to indorse her signature.  There is no contradiction in an attorney's being authorized to receive checks for a client, without being authorized to indorse the checks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Morris, 517 N.E.2d at 980 (\"The authority to receive a negotiable instrument on behalf of a client does not imply the power to endorse it.\");</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Florida Bar, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there is authority for the proposition that a co-payee, like an employee, is an agent of the other co-payees for the purpose of receiving the check.  See White &amp; Summers, at 757.  In any event, if the agent receives the check, as co-payee or otherwise, and the agent procures payment over the forged indorsement of the payee, then the payee has a right to recover in conversion.  White &amp; Summers, at 757.  This is a \"conventional [case], grist for the check theft mill.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Banks' second proffered basis for holding that Sec. 3-419 does not afford Mrs. Kenerson a remedy is that the checks reached their intended payee.  It is quite true that no conversion occurs where the owner of a forged instrument receives the proceeds despite the forgery.  Atlantic Bank of New York v. Israel Discount Bank, Ltd., 441 N.Y.S.2d 315, 317 (N.Y.App.1981).  But \"it cannot be said that the monies reached their intended destination when one intended beneficiary, the plaintiff, was deprived of any incident of ownership.\"  True v. Fleet Bank, 138 N.H. 679, 645 A.2d 671 (N.H.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In True, plaintiff sued the drawee bank for conversion of the proceeds of a settlement check payable to plaintiff and her attorney;  her attorney, without authorization, indorsed her name upon and deposited the check in a trust account.  645 A.2d at 671.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court rejected defendant's contention that the funds reached their intended destination when they were deposited in an interest-bearing trust account for the benefit of plaintiff.  Id. at 672.  The court reasoned that \"when the defendant accepted the two-party check without the plaintiff's indorsement, it deprived her of her rights of ownership and placed the funds beyond her control.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have already held that the checks in this case were payable to the co-administrators together, they were \"two-party\" checks as that term was used in True.   We can see no way in which this case is materially different from True.   Furthermore, appellees' contention--that the checks reached their intended destination because they were deposited in the Estate account--is merely another formulation of their argument, rejected above, that the checks were payable to the Estate, rather than to Fairbanks and plaintiff together as co-administrators of the Estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, no funds other than those that the district court determines on remand in fact reached plaintiff's hands--including, but not necessarily limited to, the $20,000 to which she admits receiving--reached the intended payee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final argument advanced by the Banks is that appellant's action for conversion is barred by her own negligence respecting the forgeries.

The Banks have failed to identify precisely any disputed fact that is material to plaintiff's claim.  We are concerned, however, that the trial court's erroneous allowance of the Banks' motion for summary judgment may have distracted attention from the fact that if the Banks wanted to press their contention, in the alternative, that the Sec. 3-406 defense should go to the factfinder, the Banks were entitled to a reasonable opportunity to proffer evidence that would support such a finding of fact.  On the record before us, it is not clear that the Banks were appropriately notified that summary judgment might be entered against them as to this defense absent a proffer of admissible evidence to show the existence of a material dispute of fact on this issue.  Thus, we will vacate the trial court's rulings on the cross-motions for summary judgment as to the Banks' liability and remand for such further proceedings, if any, as the district court deems appropriate before entry of final judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court for Dean Witter is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court awarding summary judgment for Morgan Guaranty Trust Company and Bank of California, N.A., and denying plaintiff summary judgment as to liability against those parties, is vacated.

We affirm the judgment for Dean Witter, but vacate the judgment for other defendants and remand for such further proceedings, consistent with this Opinion, as may be necessary to final disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One week after the death of Vaughan H. Kenerson in July 1981, the Sullivan County Probate Court appointed Jean R. Kenerson and John C. Fairbanks as co-administrators of his Estate.  Mrs. Kenerson, having limited experience in financial matters, including estate administration and investments, relied on Fairbanks' legal and investment counsel.  She took little, if any, role in the Estate administration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1981, Fairbanks opened an Estate checking account at First Citizens National Bank, listing himself as the sole authorized signatory.  He also maintained a trust account for his law offices at the same bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1981, Fairbanks opened an account for the Estate with Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., into which he placed stock holdings of the Estate valued at $248,660.87.  Fairbanks did not inform Mrs. Kenerson of the existence of the Dean Witter account or of his withdrawals from it, totalling $255,978.38 between November 1981 and the closing of the account in October 1984.  Fairbanks received the withdrawals in the form of checks that were mailed to him.  Most of the checks were issued in the following manner:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Pay to the order of</p>\n    <p>Estate of Vaughan H. Kenerson</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>Jean R. Kenerson &amp;</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>John C. Fairbanks Administrators</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On some checks, however, \"Admin\" instead of \"Administrators\" appeared on the last line.  The checks were drawn on Dean Witter's accounts at Morgan Guaranty Trust Company and Bank of California.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fairbanks deposited one of the Dean Witter checks, in the amount of $150,000, in his own account at First Citizens National Bank.  He deposited the other checks in the Estate checking account that he had opened at First Citizens National Bank.  Fairbanks indorsed these checks by writing first his own name (without any description of his role), followed by the name of Mrs. Kenerson.  No evidence was offered at trial that Mrs. Kenerson had ever affirmatively authorized Fairbanks to indorse any checks in her name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In each instance, First Citizens National Bank, the depository bank, accepted the check and transmitted it to the drawee bank--Morgan Guaranty Trust or Bank of California (\"Banks\")--and the drawee bank paid the check.  Though the record is not explicit, the parties appear to have assumed, and we take it to be undisputed, that in each instance the drawee bank charged Dean Witter's account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fairbanks withdrew from the Estate bank account, for his own benefit, all but a small portion of the funds in that account.  Mrs. Kenerson acknowledged receiving only $20,000.  In any event, appellees do not contend that she received any more than $66,000.  Beyond this sum, little if any of the remaining funds from the Estate account with First Citizens National Bank were disbursed in any way that inured to Mrs. Kenerson's benefit, either individually or in her capacity as co-administrator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff did not sue the most obvious target, Fairbanks;  he had disappeared.  Instead she sued Dean Witter, drawer of the checks, and Morgan Guaranty Trust and Bank of California, drawees (or payors) of the checks.  (Plaintiff initially sued the depositor bank, too, but claims against the F.D.I.C., as that bank's successor in interest, were dismissed by stipulation.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff sued Dean Witter on the theory that it was still liable to her on the checks because she had received only a small portion of their value and, in her capacity as co-administrator and later sole administratrix, was entitled to recover a sum equal to the remainder of the full value.  She sued the drawee Banks on the theory that they had converted the proceeds of the checks when they paid them over the forged indorsements of her name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff sued all defendants--the drawer (Dean Witter) and drawees (the Banks)--on two different theories.  The trial court, in granting summary judgment to all defendants, relied, essentially, on one proposition--that under the U.C.C.  (as enacted in New Hampshire) and the common law (as developed in New Hampshire) all defendants were entitled to rely on Fairbanks' indorsement when paying on the checks he forged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court read the checks as payable to the Estate.  Based on this reading, the court concluded that Fairbanks' negotiation of the checks--by his own indorsement and the forged indorsement in plaintiff's name--absolved defendants of liability to plaintiff.  We conclude that the trial court's reasoning rested on an impermissible reading of the checks and that the rules of law invoked by the trial court do not apply to the checks at issue in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume, without deciding, that, in general, a determination as to who are the payees of an instrument may be one of fact if on the evidence received, under the applicable law, reasonable finders of fact could differ.  Cf. Feldman Construction Co. v. Union Bank, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></a></span>, 913 (1972) (referring to \"trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law that the check was payable jointly to two payees and required the endorsement of both\").  We agree with the district court that, on the evidence before the court in this case, factfinders can not reasonably differ as to the proper reading of the instruments at issue, and therefore the determination of the meaning of those instruments must be made by the court \"as a matter of law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the determination of the trial court, however, we conclude that the only reasonable construction of the checks at issue in this case is that they were payable to plaintiff and Fairbanks together (that is, collectively) as payees, in their capacities as administrators of the Estate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we explain more fully below, under the statute and the applicable precedents, a check payable to two persons together (as distinguished from a check payable in the alternative, to either of two persons) can properly be negotiated only on the valid indorsements of both payees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, as explained in Parts III and IV below, because Fairbanks had authority to receive the checks, even though he did not have authority to indorse them with plaintiff's signature and then negotiate them, summary judgment for drawer Dean Witter was appropriate, given that the Banks paid the checks and charged Dean Witter's account.  This rule as to the drawer's discharge applies even when the payment is on a forged indorsement.  It is, however, a rule as to a drawer's liability and does not apply to drawees.  For this and other reasons, explained below, we vacate summary judgment for appellee Banks and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff sued Dean Witter, drawer of the checks, on the ground that Dean Witter was liable to her on the instruments themselves.

Thus, in construing Sec. 3-603, as well as other statutes referred to later in this Opinion, we do not have the benefit of direct guidance from New Hampshire case law.  We are guided, however, by principles of statutory interpretation that are well settled in New Hampshire law.  We begin by considering the words of the statute, and on the assumption \"that all words in [the] statute were meant to be given meaning in the interpretation of the statute,\" Town of Wolfeboro v. Smith, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">755</span></span>, 756-57 (1989).

Nonetheless, Fairbanks was an agent of plaintiff for some purposes, and was authorized to receive the checks on her behalf;  therefore, under a rule of the common law that was not abrogated by enactment of the U.C.C. in New Hampshire, Dean Witter's delivery of the checks to Fairbanks, followed by the payment of the checks through the Banks, absolved Dean Witter of liability on the instruments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all relevant respects, the New Hampshire statute mirrors precisely the Uniform Commercial Code.  Our citations will be primarily to the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated.  References to the statute in the text of this Opinion, however, will be by section number alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The New Hampshire statute, as well as the Uniform Commercial Code on which it is based, defines a \"holder\" as a person who is in possession of an instrument drawn, issued, or indorsed to him or to his order.  R.S.A. 382-A:1-201(20).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  A holder of an instrument has the power to negotiate or transfer it, or to discharge the instrument or enforce payment on it in his own name.  R.S.A. 382-A:3-301.  Negotiation is the transfer of an instrument in such form that the transferee becomes a holder.  R.S.A. 382-A:3-202(1).  Negotiation of an instrument that is payable to the order of specific persons is accomplished by delivery of the instrument with all the necessary indorsements.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that Fairbanks was in possession of the checks, and that the checks were drawn to him in his capacity as administrator.  They were not drawn to him alone, however, but to him and plaintiff together in their capacities as administrators.  Neither co-administrator, acting on his or her own, could negotiate the checks.  Rather, the indorsements of both administrators were \"necessary,\" as that term is used in Sec. 3-202(1), to \"negotiate[ ]\" the checks as that term is used in Sec. 3-116(b), according to which an instrument payable to two or more persons, if not in the alternative, is payable to all of them together and may be \"negotiated\" only by all of them.  Plaintiff never indorsed the checks.  Thus, Fairbanks did not properly negotiate the checks when he signed his indorsement, forged the indorsement of plaintiff, and delivered the checks to the depository bank.  Consequently, Dean Witter's payment to Fairbanks on those checks did not constitute the \"payment ... to the holder\" that results in discharge of a drawer's liability under Sec. 3-603.  To conclude otherwise would be entirely inconsistent with Sec. 3-116(b), under which, as stated in a comment, \"the rights of one [co-payee] are not discharged without his consent by the act of the other [co-payee].\"  See R.S.A. 382-A:3-116, comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not, and do not, decide whether Fairbanks was a holder for any other purpose contemplated by the statute.  Rather, we decide only that, in the circumstances of this case, under Sec. 3-603 Fairbanks was not a holder for the purpose of discharge of Dean Witter's liability when he received Dean Witter's payment through the drawee Banks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, because the checks were not properly negotiated by Fairbanks, the depository bank did not become a holder of the checks when Fairbanks delivered them to the bank.  See R.S.A. 382-A:3-202(1).  Thus, Dean Witter's payment to the depository bank, through the drawee banks, also did not constitute payment to a holder under Sec. 3-603.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated above, we conclude that the checks in this case were payable to the co-administrators together.  It is true that the manner in which the checks were written is not one that falls squarely within an explicit provision of the statute.  In these circumstances, we examine hypothetical variations, at least some of which are explicitly referred to in the statute.  We do so with the purpose of considering which, among our hypothetical instruments, the instruments at issue here most closely resemble.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Suppose, first, the checks had been made payable to \"Estate of Vaughan H. Kenerson,\" without more.  It might plausibly have been argued that under Sec. 3-110(1)(e) the indorsement of either of the co-administrators (that is, Fairbanks as administrator or Mrs. Kenerson as administrator) would have discharged drawer liability under Sec. 3-603.  Another, and probably more reasonable, interpretation of the statute is that a check drafted in this manner would be payable to all of the representatives together, in the absence of an explicit authorization in fact or in some source of law outside the U.C.C. for each to act alone;  but we need not and do not decide this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court applied Sec. 3-110(1)(e) to the checks in this case, as if they had been drawn only to \"Estate of Vaughan H. Kenerson.\"   Since Fairbanks was a representative of the Estate, the court reasoned, the checks were payable to him under Sec. 3-110(1)(e).  As we have stated above and explain further below, however, on the record in this case, the application of Sec. 3-110(1)(e) to these checks was erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Suppose, second, the checks had been made payable to \"John C. Fairbanks &amp; Jean R. Kenerson.\"   Then the indorsements of both in their individual capacities would have been required to negotiate the checks under Sec. 3-116(b).  See R.S.A. 382-A:3-116(b) &amp; comment.  According to that provision, an instrument payable to two or more persons, if not in the alternative, is payable to all of them (\"together,\" one may say) and may be negotiated only by all of them (\"together\").  See, e.g., Litchfield v. Pfeffer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2398316\"><a href=\"/opinion/2398316/litchfield-v-pfeffer/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span>, 487-88, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></span>, 415 (1976) (holding that trial court properly found under Sec. 3-116(b) that notes payable to \"Roy F.

Litchfield or order\" could be discharged only by both of them).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, suppose the checks had been made payable to \"John C. Fairbanks &amp; Jean R. Kenerson, Administrators of the Estate of Vaughan H. Kenerson.\"   Then the checks would have been payable to the named fiduciaries, according to Sec. 3-117(b), which provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>[a]n instrument made payable to a named person with the addition of words describing him ... as any ... fiduciary [other than an agent or officer of a specified person] is payable to the payee and may be negotiated ... by him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See also R.S.A. 382-A:3-117(b), comment 2 (providing example of \"John Doe, Administrator of the Estate of Richard Roe\").  In this third type of case, in which the checks are payable to both but in their fiduciary capacities, under Sec. 3-116(b) the indorsements of both in their fiduciary capacities would be required to negotiate the checks.  Accordingly, the indorsements of both in their fiduciary capacities would be necessary to invoke Sec. 3-603 to relieve the drawer of liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Persons,\" as the term is used in Sec. 3-116 and elsewhere in the statute, does not mean only \"natural persons.\"   This common sense interpretation of \"persons\" is reinforced by a statutory definition.  R.S.A. 382-A:1-201(30) (defining person as including \"individual\" or \"organization\").  It is further reinforced by usage elsewhere in the statute and in judicial opinions.  See R.S.A. 382-A:3-110(1)(e) (listing \"an estate, trust or fund\" as possible \"person[s]\" that could qualify as payees);  see also Equipment Distributors v. Charter Oak Bank, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn. Super.

Thus, \"persons\" includes corporate fiduciaries and natural persons in their fiduciary capacities, as well as natural persons individually.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The checks in this case appear most like those in the third of the categories described above.  Except for the few instances in which the word \"Administrators\" was abbreviated to \"Admin,\" the checks were made payable to the order of:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Estate of Vaughan H. Kenerson</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>Jean R. Kenerson &amp;</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>John C. Fairbanks Administrators</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the sequence of names on all the checks in this case is the reverse of the sequence in the third hypothetical category described above, in which the administrators were named first and the estate afterward.  Appellees urge that we attach great significance to this difference in sequence.  They contend that it was proper for the trial court to apply Sec. 3-110(1)(e) because the Estate appears first in the sequence.  We do not interpret the statute as supporting this contention, and appellees do not cite a single case that suggests we should.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A more reasonable interpretation is that Sec. 3-110(1)(e) is directed to cases in which the name of the estate is the only name to appear.  Comment 2 to Sec. 3-110 makes this point clear:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>2.  Paragraph (e) of subsection (1) is intended to change the result of decisions which have held that an instrument payable to the order of the estate of a decedent was payable to bearer....  The intent in such cases is obviously not to make the instrument payable to bearer, but to the order of the representative of the estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">R.S.A. 382-A:3-110, comment 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees also contend that the checks in this case should be subject to Sec. 3-110(1)(e) because the name of the Estate appears alone on the first line and is not connected by \"and\" or \"or\" to the names of its administrators.  For several reasons, the argument is not persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, one would not expect to see \"and\" or \"or\" linking the name of an estate with its administrators because the addition of such language would ordinarily be both unnecessary and confusing.  Accordingly, we decline to adopt, as an alternative reading of the checks, either (1) that they were payable to the Estate and Mrs. Kenerson and Fairbanks, or (2) that they were payable to the Estate or Mrs. Kenerson or Fairbanks.  Nor does the absence of punctuation (whether a comma or a semicolon) between the first and second lines, strengthen significantly the argument for some alternative reading.  Placing the name of the first named administrator on a separate line, below the line on which the name of the Estate appeared and above the line on which \"John C. Fairbanks Administrators\" appeared, conveyed the message that she and the individual named on the next line, with \" &amp; \" between them, were named as administrators and not as individuals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we need not explore whether it would make a difference if Jean R. Kenerson had been named individually as a payee.  She was not so named.  Even the checks on which \"Admin\" rather than \"Administrators\" appeared are not subject to interpretation as naming her in her individual capacity.  That reading is rebutted by the sequence in which the names appear--on the first line, the Estate;  on the second line, \"Jean R. Kenerson\";  and on the third line, \"John C. Fairbanks Admin.\"   If only Fairbanks were being named as administrator, common sense would reject the use of a sequence in which his name and designation as administrator were separated from the name of the estate by the name of another payee who was meant to be named only individually.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, if we were to adopt the proposed interpretation of the statute, the result would be to give no effect to the drawer's manifested intent in naming the individuals as administrators only and not as individuals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all these reasons, we conclude that Sec. 3-110(1)(e) does not apply to this case.  Thus, the trial court erred when it read the checks as instruments controlled by Sec. 3-110(1)(e) rather than instruments controlled by Sec. 3-116(b) and Sec. 3-117(b).  These sections together made plaintiff's indorsement essential to the proper negotiation of the checks under Sec. 3-202(1).  Absent proper negotiation, payment to Fairbanks was not \"payment ... to the holder\" under Sec. 3-603.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion derived from the text of the statute itself, absent New Hampshire case law in point, is confirmed by our examination of interpretations of the U.C.C. by the courts of other states and a respected commentator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A recent decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court is closely analogous.

Plaintiff GMAC was the holder of a security interest in the vehicle and was a loss payee beneficiary of that policy.  When the vehicle sustained damage, defendant Abington issued a check payable to the order of the individual and GMAC.  The check was delivered to the individual, who presented it to the drawee bank without GMAC's indorsement;  the individual received full payment, and GMAC received none of the proceeds.  The Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") held that the payee, GMAC, could proceed against the drawer on the underlying contract claim, or under Sec. 3-804.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2198446\"><a href=\"/opinion/2198446/gen-motors-acceptance-corp-v-abington-cas-ins-co/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> 602 N.E.2d </a></span>at 1088-89.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC specifically observed that suit under Sec. 3-804 was not barred by Sec. 3-603 because the individual who cashed the check without GMAC's indorsement \"was never a holder of the check.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2198446\"><a href=\"/opinion/2198446/gen-motors-acceptance-corp-v-abington-cas-ins-co/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> 602 N.E.2d </a></span>at 1089.

The SJC also relied on Sec. 3-603, observing that without GMAC's indorsement, the purchaser of the vehicle could not have taken the check by negotiation and thus did not become a holder under Sec. 3-202(1).  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2198446\"><a href=\"/opinion/2198446/gen-motors-acceptance-corp-v-abington-cas-ins-co/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> 602 N.E.2d </a></span>at 1088.

Abington, though different in details not material to this issue.  It is true that the SJC observed that GMAC and Abington were \"not in an agency relationship,\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2198446\"><a href=\"/opinion/2198446/gen-motors-acceptance-corp-v-abington-cas-ins-co/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> 602 N.E.2d </a></span>at 1087, and appellees in this case have argued that Fairbanks was an agent for plaintiff.  We hold, however, that in the absence of any evidence that plaintiff actually or apparently authorized Fairbanks to indorse and negotiate checks on her behalf, he was not an agent for indorsing and negotiating the Dean Witter checks.  Thus, the present case, like GMAC v. Abington, is one in which for these purposes the payees were \"not in an agency relationship.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2198446\"><a href=\"/opinion/2198446/gen-motors-acceptance-corp-v-abington-cas-ins-co/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> 602 N.E.2d </a></span>at 1087.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other but closely analogous circumstances, courts and commentators have adopted the same reasoning and come to the same conclusion as we do, namely, that payment on a missing or forged indorsement does not discharge a party from liability.  White and Summers address, for example, the situation in which a thief, rather than a co-payee, steals order paper and forges the payee's indorsement.  The thief who steals order paper cannot qualify as a holder, and the thief's signature is not an indorsement.  White &amp; Summers, 680 n. 7.  Subsequent takers, also, will not be holders.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2198446\"><a href=\"/opinion/2198446/gen-motors-acceptance-corp-v-abington-cas-ins-co/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 680. </a></span> Thus, when the drawee or maker pays the presenter, the payor will not have paid a holder, no discharge under Sec. 3-603 will have occurred, and the original owner can recover on the stolen instrument under Sec. 3-804 or on the underlying obligation.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same result holds where an indorsement is missing, rather than forged.  In a suit by the drawee bank against the collecting bank for accepting a check with a missing indorsement, a California appeals court noted that \"[w]hen a check is made payable to two payees jointly, only proper negotiation, i.e., endorsement by both, results in the payment contemplated\" by Sec. 3-603.

The meaning of holder as it is used in this instance, appears, however, to be a deviation from the definition of the term in Sec. 1-201(20).  Reading Sec. 3-603 together with Secs. 1-201(20), 3-202(1), and 3-116(b), one is driven to the conclusion that payment to a thief does not constitute payment to a holder for the purpose of discharge under Sec. 3-603.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court also relied on Protective Check Writer Co. v.

It is unclear whether the trial court, in its citation to the single-entity rule, meant that only Fairbanks' signature was necessary to negotiate the checks, or instead meant that under this rule Fairbanks was authorized to sign the indorsement of his co-administrator, plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the trial court meant the former, we have already rejected the argument that under New Hampshire law Dean Witter was relieved of liability by paying on only one effective indorsement where two were required.  Even if Protective Check Writer can properly be interpreted as standing for the proposition that fewer than all co-administrators may negotiate an instrument made payable to all of them together--and we do not decide whether it does--it would be displaced by the provisions of the later-enacted statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the trial court relied on Protective Check Writer for the proposition that Fairbanks, as administrator, was authorized in law to sign the indorsement of plaintiff, his co-administrator, we conclude that the statute displaces that purported rule also, even if we assume it did exist (in the form assumed by the trial judge) in earlier New Hampshire law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In analyzing the relationship between the statute and the common law that existed before its enactment, we start with not only the guidance of Town of Wolfeboro and Petition of Jane <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Doe,</span> supra</span>, but as well the legislative mandate that \"unless displaced by the particular provisions of this chapter the principles of law and equity ... shall supplement its provisions.\"   See R.S.A. 382-A:1-103.  Construing sections of the statute in combination, as we must under Petition of Jane Doe, we conclude that Secs. 3-116(b) and 3-117(b) leave no room for operation of the single-entity rule regarding commercial instruments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute is premised on an assumption that an instrument may be made payable to an estate, see R.S.A. 382-A:3-110(1)(e), or its fiduciaries, see R.S.A. 382-A:3-117(b).  Although both clauses are worded in the singular (\"representative\" in Sec. 3-110(1)(e), \"named person\" in Sec. 3-117(b)), and the illustrations in the comment to Sec. 3-117(b) include only one fiduciary, words in the singular number include the plural.  See R.S.A. 382-A:1-102(5)(a).  We need not decide, and do not decide, whether, under Sec. 3-110(1)(e) and other relevant provisions, a check made payable to an estate alone can be negotiated on the indorsement of just one of its administrators.  Where, however, a check is payable to two named administrators, not in the alternative, Sec. 3-116(b) declares that the instrument is payable to the two fiduciaries together, and is negotiable only by the two together.  It would render Sec. 3-116(b) a nullity, at least with respect to checks made payable to co-administrators of estates, to hold that one of two or more co-administrators can, as a matter of law, sign the indorsements of fellow administrators and proceed to negotiate what is \"negotiable only by all of them.\"   Thus, Sec. 3-117(b) and Sec. 3-116(b), considered together, displace the common law single-entity rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees rely on a commentator's suggestion that the problem of who can indorse an instrument made payable to several administrators \"will depend, as it did under prior law, on whether one personal representative has authority to act on behalf of the others....\"  See Anderson, UCC 3d Sec. 3-116:31.  His premise, that \"[t]he Code makes no provision in this respect,\" however, is subject to question.  Perhaps it may be said that the Code does not do so in any single provision.  But the Code, as just noted, explicitly allows for instruments payable to several persons together, and we see no reason not to apply Sec. 3-116 when the \"persons\" are individuals named in their capacity as fiduciaries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rules of construction stated in the statute itself further strengthen this interpretation.  The statute declares that it is to be \"liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies.\"   R.S.A. 382-A:1-102(1).  One purpose of the statute is to \"simplify, clarify and modernize the law governing commercial transactions.\"   R.S.A. 382-A:1-102(2)(a).  Appellees have offered no reason to infer that, due to policy considerations unique to the administration of estates, either the drafters of the U.C.C. or state legislatures (including that of New Hampshire), in proposing and adopting Secs. 3-116(b) and 3-117(b), manifested an intent to leave intact a common law single-entity rule, in those states where it existed or where no precedent existed one way or the other.  Furthermore, though some recent cases in other jurisdictions continue to cite the single-entity rule, see, e.g., Holmes v. Lankenau Hospital, 426 Pa.Super. 452, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2337087\"><a href=\"/opinion/2337087/holmes-v-lankenau-hosp/\"><span class=\"volume\">627</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span>, 768 (1993), a growing body of authority in the field of probate law (even if still a minority) rejects the rule.  See Unif.  Probate Code Sec. 3-717, 8 U.L.A. 340 (1983) (\"If two or more persons are appointed co-representatives and unless the will provides otherwise, the concurrence of all is required on all acts connected with the administration and distribution of the estate.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that the statute should be read as not preserving any purportedly pre-existing single-entity rule is further supported by the lack of any showing that this rule was ever firmly embedded in New Hampshire law.  Appellees cite only one New Hampshire case, Protective Check <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3554357\"><a href=\"/opinion/3574086/protective-check-writer-co-inc-v-collins/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Writer,</span> supra</a></span>, in support of their contention that the single-entity rule was and is now a part of New Hampshire law.

The court thus had no reason to be concerned with the very different question whether one co-representative has authority to bind the estate by action taken without the approval or even knowledge of the other.

The U.C.C. provides, however, that \"[u]nless displaced by the particular provisions of this chapter the principles of law and equity, including ... the law relative to ... principal and agent ... shall supplement its provisions.\"   R.S.A. 382-A:1-103.  We conclude that the U.C.C. and the New Hampshire statute do not displace the common law agency rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The U.C.C. and the New Hampshire statute do not contain \"particular provisions\" that provide for a cause of action by a payee against a drawer where a co-payee forges the payee's name and alone obtains the proceeds.  Daniel E. Murray, Joint Payee Checks--Forged and Missing Endorsements, 78 Comm.Law J. 393, 399 (1973).  Section 3-804, it is true, allows a cause of action to be maintained by a payee against a drawer even when the payee does not qualify as a holder.  Operation of that section, however, is based on the stated premise that the defendant drawer of the instrument is \"liable thereon.\"   Thus, Sec. 3-804 does not \"displace\" common law rules, such as the rule of agency at issue here, that are relevant to determining the liability of the drawer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has explicitly come to the same conclusion.  In Terry v. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2103206\"><a href=\"/opinion/2103206/terry-v-kemper-ins-co/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Kemper,</span> supra</a></span>, the court adopted the Restatement rule as the law of Massachusetts.  A decade later, it held that a payee could sue a drawer--under Sec. 3-804 or on the underlying contractual obligation--where the instrument was drawn to the plaintiff and a co-payee and the drawer delivered the instrument to the co-payee, who absconded with the plaintiff's funds.  See GMAC v. Abington Casualty Insurance <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>.   In GMAC, the court distinguished Terry v. Kemper, because that case was one in which the absconding co-payee was authorized by the plaintiff to receive the check on his <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2198446\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">behalf.</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/2198446/gen-motors-acceptance-corp-v-abington-cas-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">602</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1087</span></a></span>.   Thus, the SJC reasoned that there was no inconsistency between recognizing, in general, a payee's cause of action against a drawer under Sec. 3-804, and barring such an action where the instrument is delivered to an authorized agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is another, perhaps more plausible argument that Secs. 3-116(b) and 3-404 \"displace\" the common law rule in question.  Section 3-116(b), the argument goes, requires the signatures of both principal and agent where they are both named as co-payees, as in this case.

The Banks relied on Sec. 3-301, defining the rights of a holder as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p>The holder of an instrument whether or not he is the owner may transfer or negotiate it and, except as otherwise provided in Section 3-603 on payment or satisfaction, discharge it or enforce payment in his own name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court agreed that Fairbanks was a holder of the checks and could rightfully negotiate them with his indorsement alone, even though he forged Mrs. Kenerson's indorsement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As explained in Part III.A., Fairbanks was not a holder for the purpose of discharge of drawer liability under Sec. 3-603.  Here, the question presented is whether Fairbanks, acting alone, could exercise the powers of a holder under Sec. 3-301 in a manner that would discharge drawees of liability.  We conclude here, also, that Fairbanks could not, acting alone, exercise the powers of a holder--in this instance for the purpose of invoking Sec. 3-301.

A holder's power of \"negotiation\" of an instrument under Sec. 3-301 depends, under Sec. 3-202(1), upon the holder's having obtained all \"necessary\" indorsements.  In this case, as we have already established, Sec. 3-116(b) renders \"necessary\" the signatures of both co-payees, in their fiduciary capacities.  Indeed, to conclude that Fairbanks could alone negotiate the checks under Sec. 3-301 would practically nullify Sec. 3-116(b).

On the record before us, it is not clear that the Banks were appropriately notified that summary judgment might be entered against them as to this defense absent a proffer of admissible evidence to show the existence of a material dispute of fact on this issue.  Thus, we will vacate the trial court's rulings on the cross-motions for summary judgment as to the Banks' liability and remand for such further proceedings, if any, as the district court deems appropriate before entry of final judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court for Dean Witter is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court awarding summary judgment for Morgan Guaranty Trust Company and Bank of California, N.A., and denying plaintiff summary judgment as to liability against those parties, is vacated.
