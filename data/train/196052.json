We explain briefly.\n\n          A defendant  has the burden of  proving his entitlement\n\nto a downward adjustment  in the base offense level  referable to\n\nhis role in  the offense.  See United States  v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d\r                                                                 \n\n330,  332 (1st Cir. 1990).  Such determinations are primarily for\n\nthe district  court.  Once  they have  been made, we  review them\n\nonly for clear  error.1  See id. at 333.   Moreover, \"where there\r                                          \n\nis  more  than  one  plausible  view  of  the  circumstances, the\n\nsentencing  court's choice among  supportable alternatives cannot\n\nbe clearly erroneous.\"  United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499,  508\r                                                       \n\n(1st Cir. 1990).   On this record, appellant cannot  overcome the\n\ncombined  force of these  tenets.  The  district court's decision\n\nnot  to make any adjustment  for role in  the offense seems amply\n\nwarranted.\n\n          Although this conclusion  is fully  dispositive of  the\n\nappeal, we add a point of clarification.  Contrary to appellant's\n\nimportuning,  a defendant  is  not a  \"minor\" participant  merely\n\nbecause  he  is,  relatively  speaking, less  culpable  than  the\n\ncoconspirators with whom he is aligned.  See U.S.S.G.   3B1.2(b),\r                                                      \n\ncomment.  (n.3).   He  must be  \"less  culpable than  the average\n                    \r                              \n\n     1Here, of course, the standard is even less welcoming to the\ndefendant.  Appellant did not ask the district court for a \"minor\nparticipant\" adjustment  (although he  did unsuccessfully seek  a\n\"minimal  participant\" adjustment).   Because appellant argues on\nappeal a  point not  raised  below, our  review is,  at best,  as\ndefense counsel acknowledges, for plain error.  See United States\r                                                                           \nv.

Brandon,\r                                                                          \n\n17  F.3d 409,  460 (1st  Cir. 1994),  or, put  another  way, only\n\ntangentially involved  in the  offense of conviction,  see United\r                                                                           \n\nStates  v.

On this\r                           \n\nstandard, appellant was obviously not a minor  participant in the\n\ndrug-trafficking scheme.\n\n          We need go no further.  We summarily affirm appellant's\n\nconviction and the sentence  imposed by the district court.   See\r                                                                           \n\n1st Cir.
