Vargas  appeals the\r                            \n\nfinal judgment  entered by  the United States  District Court\n\nfor the District of Rhode Island in favor of appellee, Louise\n\nDurfee,  Director   of  the   Rhode   Island  Department   of\n\nEnvironmental Management [DEM].   Vargas alleged that,  while\n\nemployed at the DEM, he had been subject to racial harassment\n\nand had been  terminated because of his national origin, both\n\nin violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42\n\nU.S.C.   20002 et seq.  Judgment was entered for Durfee after\r                                 \n\na  three day bench trial.  We  affirm.  Only one issue raised\n\nby Vargas merits extended comment.\n\n     Vargas  asserts that  the district  court erred  when it\n\ndenied his request for a  jury trial.  Vargas claims  that he\n\nhad a right to a jury trial because, in addition to equitable\n\nrelief,   his  complaint   sought  compensatory   relief  for\n\nemotional distress, embarrassment and humiliation.  \n\n     Since the conduct alleged in this action occurred before\n\nNovember  21,  1991, it  is not  affected  by the  1991 Civil\n\nRights Act which grants  a Title VII plaintiff the right to a\n\njury  trial  and  the  right to  seek  compensatory  damages.\n\nLandgraf v. USI  Film Prods., 114 S.Ct.  1483, 1505-08 (1994)\r                                       \n\n(jury trial  and compensatory damage provisions  do not apply\n\nto conduct  occurring before November  21, 1991).   While the\n\nSupreme Court has never  decided whether a petitioner seeking\n\nback pay is entitled to a jury trial under Title VII for acts\r\r\n\noccurring before November 21,  1991, see id. at 1490  n.4, in\r                                                       \n\nthis  circuit, \"'it is well established that Title VII [prior\n\nto  the  1991  amendment],  being  essentially  equitable  in\n\nnature, does not carry with it the right to trial  by jury,'\"\n\neven  when  the plaintiff  seeks back  pay.   Ramos  v. Roche\r                                                                         \n\nProducts, Inc., 936 F.2d 43, 49-50 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,\r                                                                        \n\n502 U.S. 941 (1991) (quoting Olin v. Prudential Ins. Co., 798\r                                                                   \n\nF.2d  1, 7 (1st Cir. 1986)).   Furthermore, since the acts of\n\nwhich   Vargas  complains   allegedly  occurred   before  the\n\nenactment  of  the  Civil Rights  Act  of  1991,  he was  not\n\nentitled  to seek  compensatory  relief.   See Landgraf,  114\r                                                                   \n\nS.Ct. at 1490 (\"Before  the enactment of the 1991  Act, Title\n\nVII afforded only 'equitable'  remedies.\");  Phetosomphone v.\r                                                                      \n\nAllison  Reed  Group, Inc.,  984 F.2d  4,  7 (1st  Cir. 1993)\r                                     \n\n(compensatory  damages  were not  available  under  Title VII\n\nbefore passage of 1991 Civil Rights Act).\n\n     Vargas' other  claims require only brief  responses.  We\n\nfind no error in the determination by the district court that\n\nVargas  failed  to   meet  his   burden  of   showing  by   a\n\npreponderance   of   the   evidence   that    the   defendant\n\ndiscriminated against him on the basis of his race.  White v.\r                                                                      \n\nVathally, 732  F.2d 1037, 1040 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 469\r                                                                    \n\nU.S. 933 (1984).   The court considered the various  bases of\n\ndiscrimination alleged  by Vargas.   In each case,  the court\n\nfound  that  Vargas  had   failed  to  establish  an  element\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nessential to his  claim.   We have reviewed  the record  with\n\ncare   and  find  no  clear  error  in  any  of  the  factual\n\ndeterminations made by the district court.\n\n       Even if Vargas were correct in his allegation that the\n\nRhode Island  Commission for Human Rights  violated state law\n\nin its investigation of his claim, Vargas neither raised this\n\nissue  before the  district  court, see  Johnston v.  Holiday\r                                                                         \n\nInns, Inc., 595  F.2d 890,  894 (1st Cir.  1979) (claims  not\r                     \n\nraised  below cannot be raised for the first time on appeal),\n\nnor  has he  shown  on  appeal  that  any  violation  by  the\n\nCommission for Human Rights  prejudiced his action in federal\n\ncourt.  \n\n     Finally, since  no final judgment has  entered requiring\n\nVargas to pay attorneys' fees, this issue is not yet properly\n\nbefore this court.\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
