Without  either forecasting  or\n\ntrammeling further development in the Rhode Island parol evidence\n\nrule, we note simply that the district court ruling in no respect\n\noffends current Rhode Island law.  The Rhode Island Supreme Court\n\nhas yet  to  address  the  broad question  urged  by  appellants:\n\nwhether the  parol evidence  rule precludes, permits  or requires\n\nconsideration of parol evidence in determining whether a particu-\n\nlar  writing embodies an integrated agreement.

But for the fact that it\r               \n\nis  pivotal to appellants'  claims, Fram is  an unremarkable case\r                                                  \n\n                                2\r\r\n\nwhich  simply upheld  the  trial court's  consideration of  parol\n\nevidence  in  determining the  actual  date  on which  a  written\n\nagreement  had been  executed where  it was  clear that  the date\n\nappearing in the writing  was entered by mistake.   See Inleasing\r                                                                           \n\nCorp.  v.
