Having  read the record and\r\n\ncarefully  considered the  parties' briefs,  we find no  basis to\r\n\ndisturb  the district  court's  well-reasoned decision.   To  the\r\n\nprecise  contrary, we regard this as a paradigmatic case in which\r\n\nto put  into practice our stated belief that, when \"a trial court\r\n\nhas  produced a  first-rate  work product,  a reviewing  tribunal\r\n\nshould  hesitate to wax longiloquent simply to hear its own words\r\n\nresonate.\"  In  re San Juan Dupont  Plaza Hotel Fire  Litig., 989\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  36,  38  (1st Cir.  1993).    Consequently,  we affirm  the\r\n\njudgment for substantially the  reasons elucidated in the opinion\r\n\nbelow.  We add only three brief comments.\r\n\n          First:  The plaintiffs  (who are members of  Local 901)\r                    First:\r                         \r\n\nurge   that   they  were   entitled   to   seniority  rights   by\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nclassification,  and  that,  therefore,  the  Union  should  have\r\n\nsafeguarded them against being \"bumped\" from their laborers' jobs\r\n\nby  non-laborers  with  greater  company-wide  seniority.    This\r\n\nexhortation is unavailing.  While the CBA is admittedly ambiguous\r\n\non the key  point of what sort of seniority  (company-wide or in-\r\n\nclassification)  prevails in respect to laborers' positions, past\r\n\npractice over many years   the so-called law of the  shop   makes\r\n\nit  transpicuously clear that  the most plausible  reading of the\r\n\nCBA favors  company-wide seniority  as the  appropriate measure.1\r\n\nIn  this situation,  the law  of the  shop controls.   See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nSteelworkers  v. Warrior  &amp; Gulf  Navig. Co.,  363 U.S.  574, 580\r                                                      \r\n\n(1960).\r\n\n          Second:   In all  events, disaffected employees  do not\r                    Second:\r                          \r\n\npossess  an  absolute  right  to  have  their  union  shepherd  a\r\n\ncomplaint through the grievance  process to the bitter end.   \"In\r\n\nthe   context  of   employee   grievances,  the   duty  of   fair\r\n\nrepresentation  is  not a  straitjacket  which  forces unions  to\r\n\npursue  grievance   remedies  under  the   collective  bargaining\r\n\nagreement in every case where an employee has a complaint against\r\n\nthe company.  . . .  A  union is accorded considerable discretion\r\n\nin dealing  with  grievance  matters,  and it  may  consider  the\r\n\ninterests  of all  its members  when deciding  whether or  not to\r\n\npress the claims  of an  individual employee.\"   Seymour v.  Olin\r                                                                           \r\n\nCorp., 666 F.2d  202, 208  (Former 5th Cir.  1982).  Put  another\r               \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1It  is worthy of note  that several of  the plaintiffs were\r\nthemselves,   on   earlier   occasions,   beneficiaries   of  the\r\ninterpretation that they now strain to repudiate.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nway,  a union, caught in the middle between dueling employees, is\r\n\nnot  obliged to throw some union members  to the wolves merely to\r\n\nplacate others.\r\n\n          In this case,  the Union offered to process a grievance\r\n\nthat presented both sides of the  story.  The plaintiffs asked to\r\n\nhave  this   proposed  grievance  withdrawn.     They  sought  to\r\n\nsubstitute  in  its  place  a grievance  containing  a  one-sided\r\n\npresentation and  adamantly insisted that the  Union embrace this\r\n\nversion.    Understandably, the  Union declined  to  do so.   The\r\n\nundisputed facts  reveal that the Union acted  reasonably both in\r\n\noffering  to press a balanced grievance and in refusing to grieve\r\n\non the plaintiffs' terms.  No  more is exigible.  See, e.g., Vaca\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Sipes, 386 U.S.  171, 190-91 (1967); De Arroyo v. Sindicato de\r                                                                           \r\n\nTrabajadores  Packinghouse, 425  F.2d  281, 284  n.2 (1st  Cir.),\r                                    \r\n\ncert. denied, 400 U.S. 877 (1970).\r                      \r\n\n          This   observation  leads   directly   to   a   further\r\n\nobservation.  Vaca teaches that, even if a union misconstrues the\r                            \r\n\nCBA, its  misconstruction,  simpliciter, does  not  constitute  a\r                                                 \r\n\nbreach of its duty of fair representation.  See Vaca, 386 U.S. at\r                                                              \r\n\n190.  There  is no breach  unless the union's  \"conduct toward  a\r\n\nmember   of  the   collective  bargaining   unit   is  arbitrary,\r\n\ndiscriminatory or in  bad faith.\"   Id.; accord  Air Line  Pilots\r                                                                           \r\n\nAss'n  v.

In this\r                        \r\n\ninstance, no  rational factfinder  could conclude that  the Union\r\n\ncrossed that line.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          Third:  The plaintiffs' case against Crowley is no more\r                    Third:\r                         \r\n\nrobust than  their case against the Union.  In point of fact, the\r\n\ninadequacy of  the plaintiffs'  claim against the  Union presages\r\n\nthe  inadequacy  of their  claim against  Crowley.   In  order to\r\n\nexcuse  their  failure to  exhaust  contractual  remedies in  the\r\n\nconventional manner and prevail in a hybrid section 301 action on\r\n\na  theory  that  the   employer  violated  the  CBA,  disgruntled\r\n\nemployees  must  first  prevail on  their  unfair  representation\r\n\nclaim.  See Breininger v. Sheet Metal Workers Int'l, 493 U.S. 67,\r                                                             \r\n\n82 (1989);  DelCostello v.

To  the\r\n\nprecise  contrary, we regard this as a paradigmatic case in which\r\n\nto put  into practice our stated belief that, when \"a trial court\r\n\nhas  produced a  first-rate  work product,  a reviewing  tribunal\r\n\nshould  hesitate to wax longiloquent simply to hear its own words\r\n\nresonate.\"  In  re San Juan Dupont  Plaza Hotel Fire  Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602834\"><a href=\"/opinion/602834/in-re-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire-litigation-holders-capital/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span>\r                                                                      \r\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  38  (1st Cir.  1993).    Consequently,  we affirm  the\r\n\njudgment for substantially the  reasons elucidated in the opinion\r\n\nbelow.  We add only three brief comments.\r\n\n          First:  The plaintiffs  (who are members of  Local 901)\r                    First:\r                         \r\n\nurge   that   they  were   entitled   to   seniority  rights   by\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nclassification,  and  that,  therefore,  the  Union  should  have\r\n\nsafeguarded them against being \"bumped\" from their laborers' jobs\r\n\nby  non-laborers  with  greater  company-wide  seniority.    This\r\n\nexhortation is unavailing.  While the CBA is admittedly ambiguous\r\n\non the key  point of what sort of seniority  (company-wide or in-\r\n\nclassification)  prevails in respect to laborers' positions, past\r\n\npractice over many years   the so-called law of the  shop   makes\r\n\nit  transpicuously clear that  the most plausible  reading of the\r\n\nCBA favors  company-wide seniority  as the  appropriate measure.1\r\n\nIn  this situation,  the law  of the  shop controls.   See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nSteelworkers  v. Warrior  &amp; Gulf  Navig.

The plaintiffs asked to\r\n\nhave  this   proposed  grievance  withdrawn.     They  sought  to\r\n\nsubstitute  in  its  place  a grievance  containing  a  one-sided\r\n\npresentation and  adamantly insisted that the  Union embrace this\r\n\nversion.    Understandably, the  Union declined  to  do so.   The\r\n\nundisputed facts  reveal that the Union acted  reasonably both in\r\n\noffering  to press a balanced grievance and in refusing to grieve\r\n\non the plaintiffs' terms.  No  more is exigible.  See, e.g., Vaca\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.
