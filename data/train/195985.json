Appellant Cesar  Augusto Cetina-Gomez  was\r                           \n\nconvicted of various offenses related to an effort at cocaine\n\nsmuggling and sentenced to, inter alia, seventy-eight months'\r                                                  \n\nimprisonment.    He  appeals  a  district  court  order  that\n\nsummarily denied  his 28 U.S.C.   2255 motion to  reduce that\n\nsentence.   Appellant contends that the  district court erred\n\nby  refusing to reduce his sentence under an amendment to the\n\nUnited   States  Sentencing   Guidelines  that   was  enacted\n\napproximately two  years after  he was sentenced.  See United\r                                                                  \n\nStates  Sentencing  Commission, Guidelines  Manual  2D1.1(c),\r                                                              \n\nApplication Note  1  (Nov.  1993)(providing  that  weight  of\n\nmaterials that must be  separated from a controlled substance\n\nbefore  it can  be used  are to  be excluded  from sentencing\n\ncalculations).    The  district court  determined  that  this\n\namendment did not apply to appellant because his sentence was\n\nbased  on the net weights  of mixtures that contained cocaine\n\nin a usable form.  We have thoroughly reviewed the record and\n\nthe parties' briefs  on appeal.   We hold  that the  district\n\ncourt's analysis is  correct.  Appellant  has failed to  come\n\nforward with  any  evidence that  the  cocaine which  he  was\n\ncarrying  was not in a usable form when seized.  The portions\n\nof  the record that are  before us indicate  to the contrary.\n\nAccordingly, the judgment of  the district court is affirmed.\r                                                                        \n\nSee Local Rule 27.1.\r               \r\r\n",
