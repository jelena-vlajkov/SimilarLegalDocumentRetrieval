The\n\ndistrict  court issued  a bench  warrant for his  arrest, and\n\nGuyon was apprehended approximately two weeks later in Idaho.\n\nGuyon's  trial  continued   without  his  presence,   he  was\n\nconvicted  in  absentia on  the  bank-fraud  charges, and  on\r                                   \n\nDecember   10,   1991,   was   sentenced   to   thirty-months\n\nimprisonment.  His sentence  included a two-level enhancement\n\nfor obstruction of justice  attributed primarily to a finding\n\nthat  Guyon  had  perjured  himself and  only  incidently  to\n\nGuyon's flight during trial.\n\n          After his arrest  in Idaho, Guyon  faced additional\n\nbank-fraud charges  in the  United States District  Court for\n\nthe  Eastern District of Virginia.   On November  4, 1991, he\n\nwas  convicted on these charges  and on January  24, 1992, he\n\nwas  sentenced  to thirty-seven  months imprisonment,  to run\n\nconcurrently  with the sentence  imposed in the Massachusetts\n\nbank-fraud case.  The Virginia sentence also included  a two-\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nlevel enhancement  for obstruction of justice  due to Guyon's\n\nflight during the Massachusetts bank-fraud trial.\n\n          On May 19, 1993, counsel was appointed to represent\n\nGuyon   in  his   appeal  of  the   Massachusetts  bank-fraud\n\nconviction.1  Two  days later,  on May 21,  1993, nearly  two\n\nyears  after his  flight  from  the Massachusetts  bank-fraud\n\ntrial, the  grand jury  returned an indictment  against Guyon\n\nfor failure to appear at that trial in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n  3146(a)(1).\n\n          Following  the indictment, Guyon filed two separate\n\nmotions, each  entitled \"Motion to Dismiss  Indictment.\"  The\n\nfirst sought  dismissal on  the grounds of  unnecessary delay\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 48(b) (\"Rule 48(b)\") and the due\n\nprocess  clause  of the  Fifth  Amendment,  while the  second\n\nrelied on the ground of vindictive and malicious prosecution.\n\nAfter  a hearing,  the  district court  denied both  motions,\n\nreasoning   that   \"while   the   pre-indictment   delay  was\n\nunquestionably long and the government's justification for it\n\nweak,\" Guyon had nevertheless  suffered no prejudice  because\n\nof it.  The court also held that  a presumption of vindictive\n\nprosecution  did  not  exist  where  the  additional  charges\n\nbrought by the government were unrelated to the substance  of\n\nthe underlying (bank-fraud) charge.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  This conviction  was affirmed in United  States v. Guyon,\r                                                                        \n27 F.3d 723 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          After  a bench  trial, Guyon  was convicted  on the\n\nfailure to  appear charge  and was sentenced  to three  years\n\nprobation with that sentence  to commence after completion of\n\nthe  Virginia  bank-fraud  sentence,  which  Guyon  was  then\n\nserving.  The sentence also provided that he was to spend the\n\nfirst six  months of his  probationary period at  a Community\n\nTreatment Center (\"CTC\").  This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \n\n          Guyon now  argues that the district  court erred in\n\ndenying his motions  to dismiss  on the grounds  of (1)  pre-\n\nindictment delay  pursuant to Rule 48(b)2  and (2) vindictive\n\nprosecution.  Guyon also claims that the district court erred\n\nin  its   application  of  the  Sentencing   Guidelines  when\n\ndetermining   his   sentence   for    the   failure-to-appear\n\nconviction.  We address each argument in turn.\n\nA.  Rule 48(b)\r                          \n\n          The   district  court   refused   to  dismiss   the\n\nindictment based  on pre-indictment delay because it reasoned\n\nthat  Guyon  had not  been prejudiced  by  that delay.   When\n\nreviewing  a  court's refusal  to  dismiss  pursuant to  Rule\n\n48(b), we note that it is  within the discretion of the trial\n\ncourt to invoke this rule, and its decision \"will be reversed\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  On  appeal, Guyon does  not pursue the  argument that the\ndelay violated his Fifth Amendment due process rights.\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nonly for abuse  of discretion.\"   United States v.  Mitchell,\r                                                                        \n\n723 F.2d 1040, 1050 (1st Cir. 1983).  \n\n          Guyon argues that the  ruling of the district court\n\namounted to  an abuse of discretion in  that he was, in fact,\n\nprejudiced by  the timing of the failure-to-appear conviction\n\nand  sentencing.  He points out that his sentence for failure\n\nto appear includes six months at a CTC to commence after  the\n\ncompletion of  the Virginia  bank-fraud sentence.   He argues\n\nthat this additional penalty exceeds the statutory maximum to\n\nwhich he is subject  under the Sentencing Guidelines.   Guyon\n\nalso  claims that had he been tried and sentenced without the\n\ninordinate ordered delay on the failure-to-appear charge, his\n\nsentence  might  have  been   imposed  consecutively  to  the\n\nMassachusetts  bank-fraud sentence and  concurrently with the\n\nVirginia  sentence.  That result would  have enabled Guyon to\n\navoid the additional six months to be served at the  CTC.  We\n\nare not persuaded.\n\n          Rule  48(b) allows  a court  to dismiss a  case for\n\nfailure to prosecute.3   A Rule 48(b) right attaches  after a\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  Fed. R. Crim. P. 48(b) provides:\n\n          By Court.  If there is unnecessary  delay\r                      By Court.\n          in presenting the charge  to a grand jury\n          or  in  filing an  information  against a\n          defendant who has been held  to answer to\n          the  district  court,  or  if   there  is\n          unnecessary delay in bringing a defendant\n          to  trial,  the  court  may  dismiss  the\n          indictment, information or complaint.\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\ndefendant's arrest.  United  States v. Marion, 404  U.S. 307,\r                                                         \n\n319  (1971); see also United  States v. McCoy,  977 F.2d 706,\r                                                         \n\n712 n.6 (1st  Cir. 1992).  When a court  evaluates a claim of\n\nunnecessary delay pursuant to Rule 48(b), it may consider the\n\nlength of and reason for the delay, the defendant's assertion\n\nof his right,  and the  prejudice to the  defendant.   United\r                                                                         \n\nStates  v. Rowbotham, 430 F. Supp. 1254, 1257 (D. Mass. 1977)\r                                \n\n(citing Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 530 (1972)).  See also\r                                                                         \n\nUnited States v. Becker,  585 F.2d 703, 708 (4th  Cir. 1978),\r                                   \n\ncert. denied, 439 U.S. 1080 (1979). \r                        \n\n          In this case,  the district court found a  long and\n\nessentially  unjustified  delay.   However,  in  reaching its\n\ndecision to deny  the motion to  dismiss, the district  court\n\nfound that \"no witnesses have become unavailable or forgetful\n\nand the defendant has not spent and will not spend additional\n\ntime in prison\" due to the delay.\n\n          Guyon  argues prejudice because  the Virginia bank-\n\nfraud  sentence  was  already the  maximum  to  which  he was\n\nsubject and the six months to be served at the CTC should not\n\nhave  been imposed as  an additional penalty.   However, this\n\nargument does  not identify  any prejudice stemming  from the\n\ngovernment's delay in  returning an indictment against  Guyon\r                              \n\nfor  his failure  to  appear.   It  fails to  show  prejudice\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nappropriate to a  Rule 48(b)  dismissal, but  rather goes  to\n\nwhether the Sentencing Guidelines were properly applied.4  \n\n          Guyon  also argues  that he  was prejudiced  by the\n\ndelay because  the court  could have imposed  the failure-to-\n\nappear  sentence consecutively to  the Massachusetts sentence\n\ninstead  of consecutively to the Virginia  sentence.  We find\n\nthis  argument unpersuasive  because regardless  of when  the\n\nsentencing for failure to appear could have  occurred, it was\n\nwholly  within  the discretion  of  the  sentencing court  to\n\nrequire  that the  failure-to-appear sentence  commence after\n\nthe   Virginia  bank-fraud  sentence  instead  of  after  the\n\nMassachusetts sentence.5  \n\n          Accordingly, we  find that  the district  court did\n\nnot abuse  its discretion  denying his  motion to  dismiss by\n\nholding that Guyon was not prejudiced by the delay.6\n\nB.  Vindictive Prosecution\r                                      \n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  We discuss the  application of the  Sentencing Guidelines\nat part C., infra.\r                    C.       \n\n5.  18  U.S.C.     3146(b)  mandates that  the  sentence  for\nfailure  to  appear be  imposed  consecutively  to any  other\nsentence  being served.   We  also note  that Guyon  had been\nconvicted in both districts before being sentenced in either.\n\n6.  Given  the straightforward  resolution  of the  prejudice\nclaim, we need not  decide whether Rule 48(b) applies  to one\nwho  during the period  of delay is being  held on some other\ncharge or sentence and not because of an arrest on the charge\nassociated  with the delay.   Cf. Acha v.  United States, 910\r                                                                    \nF.2d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          The district court also refused  to dismiss Guyon's\n\nindictment   on  the  basis   of  vindictive   and  malicious\n\nprosecution.  Because the facts are not in dispute, we review\n\nonly  the   district  court's   conclusion  of  law   that  a\n\npresumption  of vindictiveness  does  not  exist.    \"Claimed\n\nerrors of law are, of course, reviewed de novo.\"  Williams v.\r                                                                      \n\nPoulos, 11 F.3d 271, 278 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                  \n\n          Guyon  has  not  provided  any actual  evidence  of\n\nvindictiveness, but  instead  has attempted  to  \"convince  a\n\ncourt  that  the circumstances  show  there  is a  sufficient\n\n`likelihood  of vindictiveness'  to warrant a  presumption of\n\nvindictiveness.\"   United States v. Marrapese,  826 F.2d 145,\r                                                         \n\n147 (1st  Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S.  944 (1987) (citation\r                                         \n\nomitted).  He alleges that the government inexplicably waited\n\nnearly  two years to seek an indictment for failure to appear\n\nand then returned  the indictment only  two days after  Guyon\n\nhad secured  counsel to appeal  his Massachusetts  bank-fraud\n\nconviction.   Guyon argues that this turn of events created a\n\npresumption of vindictive prosecution  and that the  district\n\ncourt  erred by not dismissing the indictment on that ground.\n\nWe do not agree.  \n\n          We  need  not  decide  whether   a  presumption  of\n\nvindictiveness can exist where the additional  charge brought\n\nagainst  a defendant  is  unrelated to  the substance  of the\n\nunderlying  offense because  the facts  of this  case  do not\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nreflect a \"reasonable  likelihood of vindictiveness.\"   While\n\nthe  factual setting of this  case is unique,  this Court and\n\nothers have  addressed the  general issue of  presumptions of\n\nprosecutorial  vindictiveness  and have  taken  a restrictive\n\nview as to  the circumstances under which  the presumption is\n\nwarranted.   See, e.g., United  States v.  Goodwin, 457  U.S.\r                                                              \n\n368, 382 n. 15  (1982) (presumption may not exist  where \"the\n\nonly  evidence [a defendant] is able to marshal in support of\n\nhis  allegation  of  vindictiveness  is  that the  additional\n\ncharge was brought at a point in time after his exercise of a\n\nprotected right\");  United States v.

Guyon  contends that  because the  thirty-seven\n\nmonth bank-fraud  sentence is the maximum  possible under the\n\nSentencing Guidelines, no additional penalty for  his failure\n\nto  appear  should have  been imposed.

Sec. 3146(a)(1).  We affirm.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BACKGROUND</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 27, 1991, on the fourth day of his trial on charges of bank fraud in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Guyon failed to appear.  The district court issued a bench warrant for his arrest, and Guyon was apprehended approximately two weeks later in Idaho.  Guyon's trial continued without his presence, he was convicted in absentia on the bank-fraud charges, and on December 10, 1991, was sentenced to thirty-months imprisonment.  His sentence included a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice attributed primarily to a finding that Guyon had perjured himself and only incidently to Guyon's flight during trial.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After his arrest in Idaho, Guyon faced additional bank-fraud charges in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.  On November 4, 1991, he was convicted on these charges and on January 24, 1992, he was sentenced to thirty-seven months imprisonment, to run concurrently with the sentence imposed in the Massachusetts bank-fraud case.  The Virginia sentence also included a two- level enhancement for obstruction of justice due to Guyon's flight during the Massachusetts bank-fraud trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 19, 1993, counsel was appointed to represent Guyon in his appeal of the Massachusetts bank-fraud conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Two days later, on May 21, 1993, nearly two years after his flight from the Massachusetts bank-fraud trial, the grand jury returned an indictment against Guyon for failure to appear at that trial in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3146(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the indictment, Guyon filed two separate motions, each entitled \"Motion to Dismiss Indictment.\"  The first sought dismissal on the grounds of unnecessary delay pursuant to Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 48(b) (\"Rule 48(b)\") and the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, while the second relied on the ground of vindictive and malicious prosecution.  After a hearing, the district court denied both motions, reasoning that \"while the pre-indictment delay was unquestionably long and the government's justification for it weak,\" Guyon had nevertheless suffered no prejudice because of it.  The court also held that a presumption of vindictive prosecution did not exist where the additional charges brought by the government were unrelated to the substance of the underlying (bank-fraud) charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a bench trial, Guyon was convicted on the failure to appear charge and was sentenced to three years probation with that sentence to commence after completion of the Virginia bank-fraud sentence, which Guyon was then serving.  The sentence also provided that he was to spend the first six months of his probationary period at a Community Treatment Center (\"CTC\").  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guyon now argues that the district court erred in denying his motions to dismiss on the grounds of (1) pre- indictment delay pursuant to Rule 48(b)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and (2) vindictive prosecution.  Guyon also claims that the district court erred in its application of the Sentencing Guidelines when determining his sentence for the failure-to-appear conviction.  We address each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Rule 48(b)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court refused to dismiss the indictment based on pre-indictment delay because it reasoned that Guyon had not been prejudiced by that delay.  When reviewing a court's refusal to dismiss pursuant to Rule 48(b), we note that it is within the discretion of the trial court to invoke this rule, and its decision \"will be reversed only for abuse of discretion.\"  United States v. Mitchell, 723 F.2d 1040, 1050 (1st Cir. 1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guyon argues that the ruling of the district court amounted to an abuse of discretion in that he was, in fact, prejudiced by the timing of the failure-to-appear conviction and sentencing.  He points out that his sentence for failure to appear includes six months at a CTC to commence after the completion of the Virginia bank-fraud sentence.  He argues that this additional penalty exceeds the statutory maximum to which he is subject under the Sentencing Guidelines.  Guyon also claims that had he been tried and sentenced without the inordinate ordered delay on the failure-to-appear charge, his sentence might have been imposed consecutively to the Massachusetts bank-fraud sentence and concurrently with the Virginia sentence.  That result would have enabled Guyon to avoid the additional six months to be served at the CTC. We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 48(b) allows a court to dismiss a case for failure to prosecute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  A Rule 48(b) right attaches after a defendant's arrest.  United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 319 (1971);  see also United States v. McCoy, 977 F.2d 706, 712 n.6 (1st Cir. 1992).  When a court evaluates a claim of unnecessary delay pursuant to Rule 48(b), it may consider the length of and reason for the delay, the defendant's assertion of his right, and the prejudice to the defendant.  United States v. Rowbotham, 430 F. Supp. 1254, 1257 (D. Mass. 1977) (citing Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 530 (1972)).  See also United States v. Becker, 585 F.2d 703, 708 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1080 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court found a long and essentially unjustified delay.  However, in reaching its decision to deny the motion to dismiss, the district court found that \"no witnesses have become unavailable or forgetful and the defendant has not spent and will not spend additional time in prison\" due to the delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guyon argues prejudice because the Virginia bank- fraud sentence was already the maximum to which he was subject and the six months to be served at the CTC should not have been imposed as an additional penalty.  However, this argument does not identify any prejudice stemming from the government's delay in returning an indictment against Guyon for his failure to appear.  It fails to show prejudice appropriate to a Rule 48(b) dismissal, but rather goes to whether the Sentencing Guidelines were properly applied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guyon also argues that he was prejudiced by the delay because the court could have imposed the failure-to- appear sentence consecutively to the Massachusetts sentence instead of consecutively to the Virginia sentence.  We find this argument unpersuasive because regardless of when the sentencing for failure to appear could have occurred, it was wholly within the discretion of the sentencing court to require that the failure-to-appear sentence commence after the Virginia bank-fraud sentence instead of after the Massachusetts sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion denying his motion to dismiss by holding that Guyon was not prejudiced by the delay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Vindictive Prosecution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also refused to dismiss Guyon's indictment on the basis of vindictive and malicious prosecution.  Because the facts are not in dispute, we review only the district court's conclusion of law that a presumption of vindictiveness does not exist.  \"Claimed errors of law are, of course, reviewed de novo.\"  Williams v. Poulos, 11 F.3d 271, 278 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guyon has not provided any actual evidence of vindictiveness, but instead has attempted to \"convince a court that the circumstances show there is a sufficient 'likelihood of vindictiveness' to warrant a presumption of vindictiveness.\"  United States v. Marrapese, 826 F.2d 145, 147 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 944 (1987) (citation omitted).  He alleges that the government inexplicably waited nearly two years to seek an indictment for failure to appear and then returned the indictment only two days after Guyon had secured counsel to appeal his Massachusetts bank-fraud conviction.  Guyon argues that this turn of events created a presumption of vindictive prosecution and that the district court erred by not dismissing the indictment on that ground.  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether a presumption of vindictiveness can exist where the additional charge brought against a defendant is unrelated to the substance of the underlying offense because the facts of this case do not reflect a \"reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness.\"  While the factual setting of this case is unique, this Court and others have addressed the general issue of presumptions of prosecutorial vindictiveness and have taken a restrictive view as to the circumstances under which the presumption is warranted.  See, e.g., United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 382 n. 15 (1982) (presumption may not exist where \"the only evidence [a defendant] is able to marshal in support of his allegation of vindictiveness is that the additional charge was brought at a point in time after his exercise of a protected right\");  United States v. Esposito, 968 F.2d 300, 306 (3rd Cir. 1992) (general rule that court \"will not apply a presumption of vindictiveness to a subsequent criminal case where the basis for that case is justified by the evidence and does not put the defendant twice in jeopardy\");  United States v. Pimienta-Redondo, 874 F.2d 9, 13 (1st Cir.)  (\"the presumption does not apply indiscriminately to all instances of detrimental action treading close upon the heels of a defendant's exercise of some legal right\" and should not \"serve to block a legitimate response to criminal conduct\"), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 890 (1989);  United States v. Guthrie, 789 F.2d 356, 360 (5th Cir. 1986) (no presumption is created if any event should indicate that the prosecutor's decision is motivated by some purpose other than a vindictive desire to deter or punish appeals).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the prosecution did nothing out of the ordinary in bringing a failure-to-appear indictment against Guyon, an indictment clearly supported by the evidence.  The single fact that the indictment was returned shortly after Guyon took steps to pursue an appeal of his bank-fraud conviction is simply not sufficient to establish a presumption of vindictiveness on the facts of this case.  Accordingly, we find that, as a matter of law, the facts here do not support a presumption of vindictive prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guyon argues that the district court erred when it sentenced him to a six-month period of confinement in a CTC, to begin after the sentence for the Virginia bank-fraud conviction.  Guyon contends that because the thirty-seven month bank-fraud sentence is the maximum possible under the Sentencing Guidelines, no additional penalty for his failure to appear should have been imposed.  He reasons that no sentence would be a \"reasonable incremental punishment\" under the circumstances and, alternatively, that the failure-to- appear conviction should be grouped with the bank-fraud offense for sentencing purposes.  See U.S.S.G. Secs. 5G1.3 and 2J1.6;  United States v. Agoro, 996 F.2d 1288 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not address the merits of these arguments.  Instead, we resolve this issue by noting that Guyon's term at the CTC was scheduled to expire on (approximately) October 31, 1994.  Since Guyon is presumably no longer confined to the CTC, we therefore treat this issue as moot.  See United States v. Lussier, 929 F.2d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 1991) (question of the propriety of defendant's incarceration as a result of his refusal to provide booking information is moot after defendant has provided the information and been released);  United States v. Vachon, 869 F.2d 653, 656 (1st Cir. 1989) (defendant's claim to pretrial release is moot after his conviction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This conviction was affirmed in United States v.

The Virginia sentence also included a two- level enhancement for obstruction of justice due to Guyon's flight during the Massachusetts bank-fraud trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 19, 1993, counsel was appointed to represent Guyon in his appeal of the Massachusetts bank-fraud conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Two days later, on May 21, 1993, nearly two years after his flight from the Massachusetts bank-fraud trial, the grand jury returned an indictment against Guyon for failure to appear at that trial in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3146(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the indictment, Guyon filed two separate motions, each entitled \"Motion to Dismiss Indictment.\"  The first sought dismissal on the grounds of unnecessary delay pursuant to Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 48(b) (\"Rule 48(b)\") and the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, while the second relied on the ground of vindictive and malicious prosecution.  After a hearing, the district court denied both motions, reasoning that \"while the pre-indictment delay was unquestionably long and the government's justification for it weak,\" Guyon had nevertheless suffered no prejudice because of it.  The court also held that a presumption of vindictive prosecution did not exist where the additional charges brought by the government were unrelated to the substance of the underlying (bank-fraud) charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a bench trial, Guyon was convicted on the failure to appear charge and was sentenced to three years probation with that sentence to commence after completion of the Virginia bank-fraud sentence, which Guyon was then serving.  The sentence also provided that he was to spend the first six months of his probationary period at a Community Treatment Center (\"CTC\").  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guyon now argues that the district court erred in denying his motions to dismiss on the grounds of (1) pre- indictment delay pursuant to Rule 48(b)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and (2) vindictive prosecution.  Guyon also claims that the district court erred in its application of the Sentencing Guidelines when determining his sentence for the failure-to-appear conviction.  We address each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Rule 48(b)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court refused to dismiss the indictment based on pre-indictment delay because it reasoned that Guyon had not been prejudiced by that delay.  When reviewing a court's refusal to dismiss pursuant to Rule 48(b), we note that it is within the discretion of the trial court to invoke this rule, and its decision \"will be reversed only for abuse of discretion.\"  United States v. Mitchell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"429195\"><a href=\"/opinion/429195/united-states-v-mark-a-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span>, 1050 (1st Cir. 1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guyon argues that the ruling of the district court amounted to an abuse of discretion in that he was, in fact, prejudiced by the timing of the failure-to-appear conviction and sentencing.  He points out that his sentence for failure to appear includes six months at a CTC to commence after the completion of the Virginia bank-fraud sentence.  He argues that this additional penalty exceeds the statutory maximum to which he is subject under the Sentencing Guidelines.  Guyon also claims that had he been tried and sentenced without the inordinate ordered delay on the failure-to-appear charge, his sentence might have been imposed consecutively to the Massachusetts bank-fraud sentence and concurrently with the Virginia sentence.  That result would have enabled Guyon to avoid the additional six months to be served at the CTC. We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 48(b) allows a court to dismiss a case for failure to prosecute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  A Rule 48(b) right attaches after a defendant's arrest.

When a court evaluates a claim of unnecessary delay pursuant to Rule 48(b), it may consider the length of and reason for the delay, the defendant's assertion of his right, and the prejudice to the defendant.

However, in reaching its decision to deny the motion to dismiss, the district court found that \"no witnesses have become unavailable or forgetful and the defendant has not spent and will not spend additional time in prison\" due to the delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guyon argues prejudice because the Virginia bank- fraud sentence was already the maximum to which he was subject and the six months to be served at the CTC should not have been imposed as an additional penalty.  However, this argument does not identify any prejudice stemming from the government's delay in returning an indictment against Guyon for his failure to appear.  It fails to show prejudice appropriate to a Rule 48(b) dismissal, but rather goes to whether the Sentencing Guidelines were properly applied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guyon also argues that he was prejudiced by the delay because the court could have imposed the failure-to- appear sentence consecutively to the Massachusetts sentence instead of consecutively to the Virginia sentence.  We find this argument unpersuasive because regardless of when the sentencing for failure to appear could have occurred, it was wholly within the discretion of the sentencing court to require that the failure-to-appear sentence commence after the Virginia bank-fraud sentence instead of after the Massachusetts sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion denying his motion to dismiss by holding that Guyon was not prejudiced by the delay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

He alleges that the government inexplicably waited nearly two years to seek an indictment for failure to appear and then returned the indictment only two days after Guyon had secured counsel to appeal his Massachusetts bank-fraud conviction.  Guyon argues that this turn of events created a presumption of vindictive prosecution and that the district court erred by not dismissing the indictment on that ground.  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether a presumption of vindictiveness can exist where the additional charge brought against a defendant is unrelated to the substance of the underlying offense because the facts of this case do not reflect a \"reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness.\"  While the factual setting of this case is unique, this Court and others have addressed the general issue of presumptions of prosecutorial vindictiveness and have taken a restrictive view as to the circumstances under which the presumption is warranted.  See, e.g., United States v. Goodwin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110748\"><a href=\"/opinion/110748/united-states-v-goodwin/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span>, 382 n. 15 (1982) (presumption may not exist where \"the only evidence [a defendant] is able to marshal in support of his allegation of vindictiveness is that the additional charge was brought at a point in time after his exercise of a protected right\");  United States v.

The single fact that the indictment was returned shortly after Guyon took steps to pursue an appeal of his bank-fraud conviction is simply not sufficient to establish a presumption of vindictiveness on the facts of this case.  Accordingly, we find that, as a matter of law, the facts here do not support a presumption of vindictive prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guyon argues that the district court erred when it sentenced him to a six-month period of confinement in a CTC, to begin after the sentence for the Virginia bank-fraud conviction.  Guyon contends that because the thirty-seven month bank-fraud sentence is the maximum possible under the Sentencing Guidelines, no additional penalty for his failure to appear should have been imposed.  He reasons that no sentence would be a \"reasonable incremental punishment\" under the circumstances and, alternatively, that the failure-to- appear conviction should be grouped with the bank-fraud offense for sentencing purposes.  See U.S.S.G. Secs. 5G1.3 and 2J1.6;  United States v. Agoro, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610548\"><a href=\"/opinion/610548/united-states-v-babatunde-kareem-agoro-aka-kareem-b-agoro/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1288</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not address the merits of these arguments.  Instead, we resolve this issue by noting that Guyon's term at the CTC was scheduled to expire on (approximately) October 31, 1994.  Since Guyon is presumably no longer confined to the CTC, we therefore treat this issue as moot.  See United States v.
