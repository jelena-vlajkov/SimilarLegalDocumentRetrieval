We  have read carefully the record  in this\r                           \r\n\ncase and the briefs of  the parties.  We have  considered the\r\n\nvarious claims raised  by appellant and find  none to possess\r\n\nmerit.   We affirm the grant of summary judgment to appellee,\r\n\nessentially for  the reasons given  by the district  court in\r\n\nits memorandum and order, dated January 9, 1995.  \r\n\n     Appellant's motion  to \"strike or vacate  court order of\r\n\nApril 18,  1995,\" is  denied as  moot.
