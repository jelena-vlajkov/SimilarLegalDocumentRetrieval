We have carefully reviewed the  record\r                                \r\n\nand the briefs of the parties and agree with the  decision of\r\n\nthe district court  for essentially the reasons stated in its\r\n\nMemorandum and Order, dated  September 8, 1994.  We  add only\r\n\nthe following comment.\r\n\n          Aside from taking Pamelor, claimant did not undergo\r\n\nany treatment for her depression.  She maintains that she had\r\n\nlimited insight into her condition and, thus, did not realize\r\n\nthe need for psychotherapy.  The record indicates  otherwise.\r\n\nIn December  1988, claimant informed  Dr. J. Stephen  Fink, a\r\n\nconsulting  neurologist,  that she  was  scheduled  to see  a\r\n\npsychological  counselor.  When she next saw Dr. Fink in July\r\n\n1989, she stated that she never had pursued treatment for her\r\n\ndepression.   This reveals an awareness on claimant's part of\r\n\nthe appropriateness of counseling.\r\n\n          Further, personnel at Baystate Medical Center twice\r\n\nrecommended that claimant undergo  psychotherapy.  The  first\r\n\noccasion  was  in  November  1990  after  claimant  expressed\r\n\nsuicidal ideation.  The second was in July 1991, but claimant\r\n\nrefused  the referral.  Finally, Dr.  Michael Bohnert, one of\r\n\nthe examining consultants,  indicated that  psychotherapeutic\r\n\nintervention might significantly improve claimant's prognosis\r\n\nand,  in  a  related vein,  Dr.  Elizabeth  P.  Hess, another\r\n\nexaminer,  opined that  claimant  needed  a  more  aggressive\r\n\ncourse of medication.\r\r\n\n          As we noted in Tsarelka v.  Secretary of Health and\r                                                                         \r\n\nHuman  Services, 842 F.2d  529 (1st Cir.  1988) (per curiam),\r                           \r\n\nthe Social Security regulations  require a claimant to follow\r\n\nrestorative treatment  prescribed by  her physician.   Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n534 (citing 20 C.F.R.   404.1530(a)).  The failure to observe\r\n\nprescribed treatment without good cause can lead to a finding\r\n\nof  not  disabled.   Id.  (citing 20  C.F.R.    404.1530(b)).\r                                    \r\n\nIndeed, gaps in the  medical record which indicate a  lack of\r\n\ntreatment  are  \"evidence\"  for  purposes  of the  disability\r\n\ndetermination.   Irlanda-Ortiz  v.  Secretary of  Health  and\r                                                                         \r\n\nHuman  Services,  955 F.2d  765,  769  (1st  Cir. 1991)  (per\r                           \r\n\ncuriam).  \r\n\n          Thus,   claimant's   disregard   of  the   specific\r\n\nreferrals to psychotherapy,  as well as the  lack of evidence\r\n\nto indicate  that her  medication ever was  re-evaluated, are\r\n\nproper considerations.  Based on this record, then, we cannot\r\n\nsay  that the Secretary of Health and Human Services erred in\r\n\nciting the lack of  treatment as one  of the reasons for  the\r\n\ndetermination  that  claimant  was  not disabled.    See  id.\r                                                                         \r\n\n(conflicts in the evidence  are for the Secretary).   In this\r\n\ncase, we think, the absence of treatment is dispositive.\r\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
