A pistol  assault  on  a\r                      LYNCH,  Circuit  Judge.\r                                            \r\n\nteenager in the Cathedral Housing Project of the South End of\r\n\nBoston led ultimately to the  conviction of Trevor Watson for\r\n\nthe  federal offense of possession  of a firearm  by a person\r\n\npreviously  convicted of  a  felony, 18  U.S.C.    922(g)(1).\r\n\nWatson was identified by the victim within twenty  minutes of\r\n\nthe attack in a show-up in the project conducted by the alert\r\n\nBoston police officers on the scene.  Watson was sentenced to\r\n\n64  months  of  imprisonment   followed  by  three  years  of\r\n\nsupervised release.\r\n\n          Watson  appeals, saying the district court erred in\r\n\ndenying   his    motion   to   suppress    the   on-the-scene\r\n\nidentification and  in denying his motion for  acquittal.  He\r\n\nalso  says  the  government  withheld  exculpatory  evidence.\r\n\nFinding  that  the  district  court's conclusions,  after  it\r\n\ncarefully  and sensitively considered  these arguments at the\r\n\ntrial stage, were correct, we affirm.\r\n\n          The jury  was entitled to find  the following urban\r\n\nsaga.    As  Alexander  Milette  was bicycling  home  to  the\r\n\nCathedral  Project, a Porsche  drove past him  and stopped in\r\n\nfront  of his  house.   Trevor  Watson  got out  of  the car,\r\n\ncarrying  a loaded pistol of  the type favored  by the Boston\r\n\npolice, a  Glock 9mm semi-automatic.   After accusing Milette\r\n\nof  liking  \"hitting  on\"  women,  Watson  aimed  the gun  at\r\n\nMilette's stomach.  Someone said \"Don't shoot him.\"\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          Instead,  Watson   pistol-whipped  Milette's  head,\r\n\ncausing the  gun to  fire into  a building and  then to  jam.\r\n\nMilette,  bleeding, ran  while  Watson unjammed  the gun  and\r\n\nfired   again,  hitting  the  building  Milette  ran  behind.\r\n\nMilette sought sanctuary  at a friend's house  and was helped\r\n\nwith his bleeding head.\r\n\n          Watson had  jumped back  into the Porsche,  only to\r\n\nhave it stall out in a deep puddle.  A nearby off-duty Boston\r\n\nPolice officer, Officer Christopher Shoulla, heard the shots,\r\n\ndrove to the project, and put out a call on his police radio.\r\n\nOfficer Shoulla saw  Watson and  asked him to  stop.   Watson\r\n\ninstead fled,  clutching his  right pocket, and,  ironically,\r\n\nran right past  Milette and  past another youth.   Two  other\r\n\nBoston officers  arrived and  gave chase.   Watson  threw the\r\n\ngun, as he ran, into a small garden.  Officer Shoulla stopped\r\n\nWatson at gunpoint.  When the officers patted down Watson and\r\n\ndetermined  he had no  gun, they retraced  Watson's steps and\r\n\nfound it within forty seconds.\r\n\n          One  officer saw  Milette, still  holding  a bloody\r\n\ntowel  to his  head, and  had the  others bring  Watson over.\r\n\nWatson was brought over  by patrol car and Milette  was asked\r\n\nby  the  police, \"What's  the  story?\"   Milette  looked, and\r\n\nidentified Watson  as his assailant.   He later  testified he\r\n\nwas 100%  sure  of  that  identification.   Watson  was  also\r\n\nidentified by the other youth past whom he had run.   The two\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nspent cartridges from  the scene of  the assault matched  the\r\n\npistol Watson discarded.\r\n\nThe Show-Up\r                       \r\n\n          Watson  attacks  the   show-up  identification   as\r\n\nimpermissibly suggestive and unreliable  and claims error  in\r\n\nthe denial of  his motion  to suppress.   A district  court's\r\n\ndenial  of a  motion  to  suppress  will  be  upheld  if  any\r\n\nreasonable view of the evidence supports the  denial.  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. De Jesus-Rios,  990 F.2d 672, 677 (1st  Cir. 1993).\r                                   \r\n\nThe  findings  of the  district court  after  a hearing  on a\r\n\npretrial motion  to  suppress are  binding  on the  court  of\r\n\nappeals unless they are clearly erroneous.

Brathwaite,  432  U.S. 98  (1977).   To  determine\r                                 \r\n\nwhether evidence  of  a pre-trial  identification  should  be\r\n\nsuppressed, a  two-pronged analysis  is required.   De Jesus-\r                                                                         \r\n\nRios,   990 F.2d  at 677.   First, the  court must  determine\r                \r\n\nwhether the procedure was impermissibly suggestive.   Id.  If\r                                                                     \r\n\nit so finds, it must decide whether the identification itself\r\n\nwas  reliable  under  the   totality  of  the  circumstances,\r\n\nnotwithstanding the suggestive procedure.   Id.  Furthermore,\r                                                           \r\n\nbefore suppressing identification evidence, a \"court  must be\r\n\npersuaded  that there  was a  very substantial  likelihood of\r\n\nirreparable  misidentification,\"  and  only in  extraordinary\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ncircumstances should identification evidence be withheld from\r\n\nthe jury.  Id. (internal quotations omitted).\r                          \r\n\n          There is no reason  to disturb the district court's\r\n\nfinding  here that  the show-up identification  procedure was\r\n\nnot unnecessarily suggestive, a  finding that eliminates  the\r\n\ndue process argument.  Show-ups immediately after the offense\r\n\nhas been committed  may be  necessary in order  to avoid  the\r\n\nmistaken apprehension of the wrong person.  See, e.g., United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Bautista,  23 F.3d  726, 730 (2d  Cir.)

Here, the crime\r                                                \r\n\nwas very fresh, the police not suggestive, and had Watson not\r\n\nbeen the assailant, Milette could easily have said so.  While\r\n\nshow-ups,  as the  district  court recognized,  contain  some\r\n\ninherent element of suggestiveness, the finding that this one\r\n\ndid not cross the line was not erroneous.1\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  district  court's   second-level  finding  that  the\r\nidentification  was  reliable  under  the   five-factor  test\r\narticulated  in De Jesus-Rios was also not erroneous.  See De\r                                                                         \r\nJesus-Rios,  990 F.2d at 677 (court  should consider \"(1) the\r                      \r\nopportunity of the witness  to view the criminal at  the time\r\nof the crime; (2)  the witness' degree of attention;  (3) the\r\naccuracy of  the witness' prior description  of the criminal;\r\n(4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the\r\nconfrontation; and  (5) the length of time  between the crime\r\nand  the confrontation\";  internal  quotations omitted);  see\r                                                                         \r\nalso Manson v.

The only factor\r                       \r\nthat weighs against admitting the out-of-court identification\r\nis  that there  was no  prior  description of  the assailant.\r\nHowever, \"'the absence  of a prior description by the witness\r\ndoes   not  necessarily   render   his  or   her   subsequent\r\nidentification suspect.'\"  United States v.

The pre-sentence\r\n\nreport recounted  a rumor  that Milette's brother,  who looks\r\n\nlike  Milette, threw water  at a woman  described as Watson's\r\n\ngirlfriend some time before the assault.  Defendant moved for\r\n\na  new trial based on this \"new\" evidence, which the district\r\n\ncourt denied.\r\n\n          To show a Brady  violation, the defendant must show\r                                     \r\n\nthat the  withheld \"evidence was exculpatory,  as measured by\r\n\nits materiality.\"  United  States v.

The argument presented -- that if he had known\r\n\nof the rumor, Watson  could have found a woman,  not Watson's\r\n\ngirlfriend, who had water thrown on her and thus come up with\r\n\na  different  assailant out  to  get  Milette's brother  (and\r\n\ninadvertently Milette) -- is sheer speculation and not enough\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nto  meet Watson's burden.2  In light of the identification of\r\n\nWatson by Milette and by the youth, the gun evidence, and the\r\n\npolice testimony, there is  no \"reasonable probability that .\r\n\n.  . the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"\r\n\nId.\r               \r\n\n          Exposure to Photograph\r                                            \r\n\n          A federal agent may have shown Milette a photograph\r\n\nof  Watson  before  Milette  testified   at  the  suppression\r\n\nhearing.    While  such conduct,  if  it  occurred,  was both\r\n\nimproper and  could have jeopardized  the government's case,3\r\n\non the  facts here  there is no  resulting reversible  error.\r\n\nThat  is because  Watson  was given  this information  before\r\n\ntrial,   the  government   did   not   attempt  an   in-court\r\n\nidentification after the purported showing, and Watson's case\r\n\nwas helped, not  hurt, by  such conduct.   The agent's  usual\r\n\npractice  was  to  carry  photographs of  the  defendant  and\r\n\nsubpoenas  in  the  same  file, which  may  have  resulted in\r\n\nMilette seeing Watson's photograph.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Defendant  also claims  that he  could have  put Watson's\r\ngirlfriend on the stand to testify that no one threw water at\r\nher.   However, the relevancy  of that testimony would depend\r\nupon the  admission of  the rumor,  which the  district court\r\ncorrectly found was inadmissible hearsay.\r\n\n3.  If the single photo  indeed had been shown to  Milette in\r\nan effort  to bolster his  identification of Watson,  we join\r\nthe comments of  the experienced district  judge that he  was\r\n\"astonished that a federal  investigative agency has an agent\r\nwho goes  out, opens her  file folder with  a picture of  the\r\ndefendant as a matter of course.\"\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          Immediately on learning  that Milette  said he  had\r\n\nbeen shown  a photograph  of Watson, the  prosecutor notified\r\n\ndefense  counsel shortly  before  trial began  on October  3,\r\n\n1994.   On October 5, the district  court held a voir dire on\r                                                                      \r\n\nthe issue at which federal agent Sheila O'Hara testified that\r\n\nshe carried photographs of defendant in her case file and may\r\n\nhave inadvertently  exposed them to Milette  when serving him\r\n\nwith one of several subpoenas.  The district court found that\r\n\nthis  happened no  sooner  than the  day  of the  suppression\r\n\nhearing.  The defendant used the information to his advantage\r\n\nby  calling  Agent O'Hara  as  his  sole  defense witness  to\r\n\ntestify that  Milette did not  identify the defendant  as his\r\n\nassailant even  if he saw a  photograph of him  and to attack\r\n\nthe investigation.\r\n\n          Watson's  Brady  violation  argument  is  misplaced\r                                     \r\n\nbecause the evidence was disclosed before trial and there was\r\n\nno demonstrable  prejudice from the delay  in the disclosure.\r\n\nSee United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 480 (1st Cir.)\r                                           \r\n\n(citing United States v.

No in-court\r\n\nidentification  was  sought  by   the  government.    At  the\r\n\nsuppression hearing, almost a year after the assault, Milette\r\n\ntestified that at the  time of the show-up  identification he\r\n\nwas sure Watson  was his  assailant, and agreed  that he  had\r\n\nrecently told Agent  O'Hara that he could  no longer identify\r\n\nhis assailant.  The fact that he may have been  shown a photo\r\n\nafter the  show-up is  not material,  and the  district court\r\n\ncorrectly  found that  it could not  be the  basis for  a new\r\n\ntrial.\r\n\nMotion for Acquittal\r                                \r\n\n          Defendant also argues that the district court erred\r\n\nin denying his motion  for judgment of acquittal.   We review\r\n\nthe evidence  presented at  trial, viewed in  the light  most\r\n\nfavorable to  the government,  to see  if it  could establish\r\n\neach  element  of the  offense  charged  beyond a  reasonable\r\n\ndoubt.

Watson argues\r                                \r\n\nthat the motion  should have been  granted because his  right\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nunder  the  Sixth  Amendment  to  cross-examine  Milette  was\r\n\nimpaired because  of  the out-of-court  nature  of  Milette's\r\n\nidentification of Watson.\r\n\n          But United  States v.  Owens, 484 U.S.  554 (1988),\r                                                  \r\n\nforecloses any such argument.  The Court there said:\r\n\n          \"[T]he Confrontation  Clause is generally\r\n          satisfied when  the  defense is  given  a\r\n          full  and fair  opportunity to  probe and\r\n          expose   . . .   infirmities   [such   as\r\n          witness'   forgetfulness,  confusion   or\r\n          evasion]    through    cross-examination,\r\n          thereby calling  to the attention  of the\r\n          factfinder the reasons  for giving  scant\r\n          weight to the witness' testimony.\"\r\n\nId. at 558 (quoting Delaware v.

Defense counsel's  vigorous attack on\r\n\nthe  reliability  of  Milette's  out-of-court  identification\r\n\nitself refutes the argument  that Watson did not have  a full\r\n\nand fair opportunity to probe.  Indeed, this case presented a\r\n\nsignificantly  better opportunity  to cross-examine  than did\r\n\nOwens.\r                 \r\n\n          Watson  also  argues  that  the  use  of  Milette's\r\n\nstatement at the suppression hearing -- that he was 100% sure\r\n\nat  the  show-up  that  the  person  he  identified  was  his\r\n\nassailant  -- to  refresh his  memory at  trial violated  the\r\n\nConfrontation Clause.   Watson's claim is  that the statement\r\n\nof   certainty  was  not   subject  to   unrestricted  cross-\r\n\nexamination because defense counsel did not know at  the time\r\n\nof  the  suppression  hearing  that  Milette  may  have  been\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nsuggestively exposed to  Watson's photograph.  Accepting  the\r\n\ndubious premise that Milette  was not subject to unrestricted\r\n\ncross-examination  at  the  suppression hearing,4  there  was\r\n\nample  opportunity to  cross-examine  the witness  as to  the\r\n\nreliability  of  that  statement  at trial.    There  was  no\r\n\nviolation  of the Confrontation Clause.   See Owens, 484 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\nat 560.  As a result, the district court correctly denied the\r\n\nmotion to acquit.\r\n\nConclusion\r                      \r\n\n          We find no  error in the  proceeding of the  trial.\r\n\nThe  district  court admirably  handled  these  issues.   The\r                                                                         \r\n\njudgment is affirmed.\r                                 \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Defendant did  not argue in  his brief that  this alleged\r\nimpairment of his opportunity to cross-examine Milette at the\r\nsuppression hearing affected the outcome of that hearing.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n",

Watson was identified by the victim within twenty minutes of the attack in a show-up in the project conducted by the alert Boston police officers on the scene.   Watson was sentenced to 64 months of imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watson appeals, saying the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the on-the-scene identification and in denying his motion for acquittal.   He also says the government withheld exculpatory evidence.   Finding that the district court's conclusions, after it carefully and sensitively considered these arguments at the trial stage, were correct, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury was entitled to find the following urban saga.   As Alexander Milette was bicycling home to the Cathedral Project, a Porsche drove past him and stopped in front of his house.   Trevor Watson got out of the car, carrying a loaded pistol of the type favored by the Boston police, a Glock 9mm semi-automatic.   After accusing Milette of liking \"hitting on\" women, Watson aimed the gun at Milette's stomach.   Someone said \"Don't shoot him.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, Watson pistol-whipped Milette's head, causing the gun to fire into a building and then to jam.   Milette, bleeding, ran while Watson unjammed the gun and fired again, hitting the building Milette ran behind.   Milette sought sanctuary at a friend's house and was helped with his bleeding head.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watson had jumped back into the Porsche, only to have it stall out in a deep puddle.   A nearby off-duty Boston Police officer, Officer Christopher Shoulla, heard the shots, drove to the project, and put out a call on his police radio.   Officer Shoulla saw Watson and asked him to stop.   Watson instead fled, clutching his right pocket, and, ironically, ran right past Milette and past another youth.   Two other Boston officers arrived and gave chase.   Watson threw the gun, as he ran, into a small garden.   Officer Shoulla stopped Watson at gunpoint.   When the officers patted down Watson and determined he had no gun, they retraced Watson's steps and found it within forty seconds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One officer saw Milette, still holding a bloody towel to his head, and had the others bring Watson over.   Watson was brought over by patrol car and Milette was asked by the police, \"What's the story?\"   Milette looked, and identified Watson as his assailant.   He later testified he was 100% sure of that identification.   Watson was also identified by the other youth past whom he had run.   The two spent cartridges from the scene of the assault matched the pistol Watson discarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Show-Up</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watson attacks the show-up identification as impermissibly suggestive and unreliable and claims error in the denial of his motion to suppress.   A district court's denial of a motion to suppress will be upheld if any reasonable view of the evidence supports the denial.  United States v. de Jesus-Rios, 990 F.2d 672, 677 (1st Cir.1993).

Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977).   To determine whether evidence of a pre-trial identification should be suppressed, a two-pronged analysis is required.  de Jesus-Rios, 990 F.2d at 677.   First, the court must determine whether the procedure was impermissibly suggestive.  Id.  If it so finds, it must decide whether the identification itself was reliable under the totality of the circumstances, notwithstanding the suggestive procedure.  Id.  Furthermore, before suppressing identification evidence, a \"court must be persuaded that there was a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification,\" and only in extraordinary circumstances should identification evidence be withheld from the jury.

Show-ups that take place immediately after the offense has been committed may be necessary in order to avoid the mistaken apprehension of the wrong person.   See, e.g., United States v. Bautista, 23 F.3d 726, 730 (2d Cir.)  (\"where an officer has or should have doubts whether a detained suspect is in fact the person sought, the officer must make immediate reasonable efforts to confirm the suspect's identity\";  internal quotations omitted), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 174, 130 L.Ed.2d 110 (1994);  Johnson v.

Schmer, 724 F.2d 249 (1st Cir.1984), proves no help to him, as the police conduct there was at the other end of the scale.   There, the show-up was staged at 3:00 a.m., nine and a half hours after the crime, at the station house, and the defendant was presented to the youthful victims who were asked \"This is him, isn't it?\"  Id. at 250.   Here, the crime was very fresh, the police not suggestive, and had Watson not been the assailant, Milette could easily have said so.   While show-ups, as the district court recognized, contain some inherent element of suggestiveness, the finding that this one did not cross the line was not erroneous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Brady Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also argues, without avail, that the government failed to disclose two items of information in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Rumor</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first has to do with a rumor.   The pre-sentence report recounted a rumor that Milette's brother, who looks like Milette, threw water at a woman described as Watson's girlfriend some time before the assault.   Defendant moved for a new trial based on this \"new\" evidence, which the district court denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To show a Brady violation, the defendant must show that the withheld \"evidence was exculpatory, as measured by its materiality.\"  United States v. Hemmer, 729 F.2d 10, 14 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1218, 104 S.Ct. 2666, 81 L.Ed.2d 371 (1984).   Evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different had the evidence been disclosed.  United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3383-84, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rumor was obviously inculpatory, not exculpatory.   The argument presented--that if he had known of the rumor, Watson could have found a woman, not Watson's girlfriend, who had water thrown on her and thus come up with a different assailant out to get Milette's brother (and inadvertently Milette)--is sheer speculation and not enough to meet Watson's burden.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In light of the identification of Watson by Milette and by the youth, the gun evidence, and the police testimony, there is no \"reasonable probability that ... the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Exposure to Photograph</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal agent may have shown Milette a photograph of Watson before Milette testified at the suppression hearing.   While such conduct, if it occurred, was both improper and could have jeopardized the government's case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> on the facts here there is no resulting reversible error.   That is because Watson was given this information before trial, the government did not attempt an in-court identification after the purported showing, and Watson's case was helped, not hurt, by such conduct.   The agent's usual practice was to carry photographs of the defendant and subpoenas in the same file, which may have resulted in Milette seeing Watson's photograph.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately on learning that Milette said he had been shown a photograph of Watson, the prosecutor notified defense counsel shortly before trial began on October 3, 1994.   On October 5, the district court held a voir dire on the issue at which federal agent Sheila O'Hara testified that she carried photographs of defendant in her case file and may have inadvertently exposed them to Milette when serving him with one of several subpoenas.   The district court found that this happened no sooner than the day of the suppression hearing.   The defendant used the information to his advantage by calling Agent O'Hara as his sole defense witness to testify that Milette did not identify the defendant as his assailant even if he saw a photograph of him and to attack the investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watson's Brady violation argument is misplaced because the evidence was disclosed before trial and there was no demonstrable prejudice from the delay in the disclosure.   See United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 480 (1st Cir.)  (citing United States v. Devin, 918 F.2d 280, 290 (1st Cir.1990)), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 409, 126 L.Ed.2d 356 (1993).   Defendant does not even argue that the delay, if any, was prejudicial.   Indeed, in light of the district court's careful handling of this matter and the failure of the defendant to seek a continuance upon learning that Milette may have been exposed to a photograph of Watson, any delay was not materially prejudicial.   See United States v. Osorio, 929 F.2d 753, 758 (1st Cir.1988) (\"Generally we have viewed the failure to ask for a continuance as an indication that defense counsel was himself satisfied he had sufficient opportunity to use the evidence advantageously.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the only identification Milette made was at the show-up within 20 minutes of the assault.   No in-court identification was sought by the government.   At the suppression hearing, almost a year after the assault, Milette testified that at the time of the show-up identification he was sure Watson was his assailant, and agreed that he had recently told Agent O'Hara that he could no longer identify his assailant.   The fact that he may have been shown a photo after the show-up is not material, and the district court correctly found that it could not be the basis for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Motion for Acquittal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal.   We review the evidence presented at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, to see if it could establish each element of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.  United States v. Hernandez, 995 F.2d 307, 311 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 407, 126 L.Ed.2d 354 (1993).   Watson argues that the motion should have been granted because his right under the Sixth Amendment to cross-examine Milette was impaired because of the out-of-court nature of Milette's identification of Watson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But United States v. Owens, 484 U.S. 554, 108 S.Ct. 838, 98 L.Ed.2d 951 (1988), forecloses any such argument.   The Court there said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>\"[T]he Confrontation Clause is generally satisfied when the defense is given a full and fair opportunity to probe and expose ... infirmities [such as witness' forgetfulness, confusion or evasion] through cross-examination, thereby calling to the attention of the factfinder the reasons for giving scant weight to the witness' testimony.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 558, 108 S.Ct. at 842 (quoting Delaware v.

Defense counsel's vigorous attack on the reliability of Milette's out-of-court identification itself refutes the argument that Watson did not have a full and fair opportunity to probe.   Indeed, this case presented a significantly better opportunity to cross-examine than did Owens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watson also argues that the use of Milette's statement at the suppression hearing--that he was 100% sure at the show-up that the person he identified was his assailant--to refresh his memory at trial violated the Confrontation Clause.   Watson's claim is that the statement of certainty was not subject to unrestricted cross-examination because defense counsel did not know at the time of the suppression hearing that Milette may have been suggestively exposed to Watson's photograph.   Accepting the dubious premise that Milette was not subject to unrestricted cross-examination at the suppression hearing,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> there was ample opportunity to cross-examine the witness as to the reliability of that statement at trial.   There was no violation of the Confrontation Clause.   See Owens, 484 U.S. at 560, 108 S.Ct. at 843.   As a result, the district court correctly denied the motion to acquit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no error in the proceeding of the trial.

See de Jesus-Rios, 990 F.2d at 677 (court should consider \"(1) the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime;  (2) the witness' degree of attention;  (3) the accuracy of the witness' prior description of the criminal;  (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation;  and (5) the length of time between the crime and the confrontation\";  internal quotations omitted);  see also Manson v.

The only factor that weighs against admitting the out-of-court identification is that there was no prior description of the assailant.

Watson was identified by the victim within twenty minutes of the attack in a show-up in the project conducted by the alert Boston police officers on the scene.

As Alexander Milette was bicycling home to the Cathedral Project, a Porsche drove past him and stopped in front of his house.   Trevor Watson got out of the car, carrying a loaded pistol of the type favored by the Boston police, a Glock 9mm semi-automatic.   After accusing Milette of liking \"hitting on\" women, Watson aimed the gun at Milette's stomach.

A nearby off-duty Boston Police officer, Officer Christopher Shoulla, heard the shots, drove to the project, and put out a call on his police radio.   Officer Shoulla saw Watson and asked him to stop.   Watson instead fled, clutching his right pocket, and, ironically, ran right past Milette and past another youth.   Two other Boston officers arrived and gave chase.   Watson threw the gun, as he ran, into a small garden.   Officer Shoulla stopped Watson at gunpoint.   When the officers patted down Watson and determined he had no gun, they retraced Watson's steps and found it within forty seconds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One officer saw Milette, still holding a bloody towel to his head, and had the others bring Watson over.   Watson was brought over by patrol car and Milette was asked by the police, \"What's the story?\"   Milette looked, and identified Watson as his assailant.   He later testified he was 100% sure of that identification.   Watson was also identified by the other youth past whom he had run.

While such conduct, if it occurred, was both improper and could have jeopardized the government's case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> on the facts here there is no resulting reversible error.   That is because Watson was given this information before trial, the government did not attempt an in-court identification after the purported showing, and Watson's case was helped, not hurt, by such conduct.   The agent's usual practice was to carry photographs of the defendant and subpoenas in the same file, which may have resulted in Milette seeing Watson's photograph.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately on learning that Milette said he had been shown a photograph of Watson, the prosecutor notified defense counsel shortly before trial began on October 3, 1994.   On October 5, the district court held a voir dire on the issue at which federal agent Sheila O'Hara testified that she carried photographs of defendant in her case file and may have inadvertently exposed them to Milette when serving him with one of several subpoenas.   The district court found that this happened no sooner than the day of the suppression hearing.   The defendant used the information to his advantage by calling Agent O'Hara as his sole defense witness to testify that Milette did not identify the defendant as his assailant even if he saw a photograph of him and to attack the investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watson's Brady violation argument is misplaced because the evidence was disclosed before trial and there was no demonstrable prejudice from the delay in the disclosure.

Indeed, in light of the district court's careful handling of this matter and the failure of the defendant to seek a continuance upon learning that Milette may have been exposed to a photograph of Watson, any delay was not materially prejudicial.   See United States v.

No in-court identification was sought by the government.   At the suppression hearing, almost a year after the assault, Milette testified that at the time of the show-up identification he was sure Watson was his assailant, and agreed that he had recently told Agent O'Hara that he could no longer identify his assailant.   The fact that he may have been shown a photo after the show-up is not material, and the district court correctly found that it could not be the basis for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Motion for Acquittal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal.

Defense counsel's vigorous attack on the reliability of Milette's out-of-court identification itself refutes the argument that Watson did not have a full and fair opportunity to probe.   Indeed, this case presented a significantly better opportunity to cross-examine than did Owens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watson also argues that the use of Milette's statement at the suppression hearing--that he was 100% sure at the show-up that the person he identified was his assailant--to refresh his memory at trial violated the Confrontation Clause.   Watson's claim is that the statement of certainty was not subject to unrestricted cross-examination because defense counsel did not know at the time of the suppression hearing that Milette may have been suggestively exposed to Watson's photograph.   Accepting the dubious premise that Milette was not subject to unrestricted cross-examination at the suppression hearing,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> there was ample opportunity to cross-examine the witness as to the reliability of that statement at trial.
