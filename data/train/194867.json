Defendant appeals an award of\n                                 \n\nattorney's  and   expert  fees  granted  to   plaintiffs  at  the\n\nconclusion of their successful  challenge to the voting districts\n\nin the Town of Johnston, Rhode Island.  We decrease the amount of\n\nthe expert fees award but otherwise affirm.\n\n                                I.\n\n     The Town  of Johnston  contains five councilmanic  districts\n\nthat, until this litigation, had not been redrawn since they were\n\nadopted in 1963.   In June  1990, two registered voters  sued the\n\ntown pursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C.    1983,\n\n1985(3), to  effect reapportionment  in accordance with  the one-\n\nperson,  one-vote standard  of  Reynolds v.  Sims,  377 U.S.  533\n                                                 \n\n(1964).  In their motion for a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs\n\nsought immediate redistricting according to data collected in the\n\n1980 census  or, alternatively,  electing all  seats  in 1990  at\n\nlarge.    The district  court  determined  that the  councilmanic\n\ndistricts were malapportioned and ordered the town to conduct at-\n\nlarge  elections that year.  It did not yet require redistricting\n\nbecause release of the 1990 census data was imminent and the town\n\ncould  not  reapportion  the  districts  without  postponing  the\n\nelections.  \n\n     Once data from the  1990 census became available, plaintiffs\n\namended their  complaint to request redistricting  based on these\n\npopulation  figures.   Finally,  in August  1992,  on the  eve of\n\ntrial, the town submitted  a reapportionment plan using  the 1990\n\n                               -3-\n\ncensus  data.   The plan,  with some  revisions, was  accepted by\n\nplaintiffs and the court, and a consent judgment was entered.\n\n     Plaintiffs then moved for  attorney's fees, expert fees, and\n\ncosts,   totalling  $26,398.13.     The  town  objected,  arguing\n\nprimarily that  plaintiffs  were not  entitled  to a  full  award\n\nbecause they  had not prevailed  on all of their  claims and that\n\nthe town was not  responsible for the malapportionment.   After a\n\nhearing, the district court  awarded plaintiffs the entire amount\n\nof their request.  This appeal followed.  \n\n                               II.\n\n     In an action  to enforce civil rights,  the prevailing party\n\nmay recover attorney's and expert fees.   42 U.S.C.   1988.1  The\n\ndetermination  of whether a party  has prevailed and the decision\n\nto  award  fees  is committed  to  the  sound  discretion of  the\n\ndistrict  court.    McDonald v.  Secretary  of  Health  and Human\n                                                                 \n\nServs., 884 F.2d 1468, 1474 (1st  Cir. 1989).  The district court\n      \n\nmust   provide  a  clear  explanation  of  its  award  to  ensure\n\nmeaningful  review.  Grendel's Den, Inc. v. Larkin, 749 F.2d 945,\n                                                  \n\n950 (1st Cir. 1984).\n\n     The  town concedes  plaintiffs' entitlement  to an  award of\n\nattorney's and expert fees.   At oral argument, it  also conceded\n\nthat plaintiffs are entitled to the full amount requested if they\n\n                    \n\n1  The retroactive applicability of the Civil Rights Act of 1991,\nwhich  amended Section  1988  to allow  the  prevailing party  to\nrecover  expert fees,  currently  is pending  before the  Supreme\nCourt.   See  Landgraf v.  USI  Film Products,  113 S.  Ct.  1250\n                                             \n(1993), granting cert. in part to, 968 F.2d 427 (5th  Cir. 1992).\n                                 \nWe need not determine whether the Act applies to this proceeding,\nhowever, because defendant has never raised the issue.\n\n                               -4-\n\nare found  to be the prevailing  party on all their  claims.  The\n\ntown  protests,  however, that  the  award  is excessive  because\n\nplaintiffs did not succeed  in obtaining reapportionment based on\n\nthe 1980 census, as they originally requested.\n\n     A party prevails if it \"`succeed[s] on any significant issue\n\nin litigation which achieve[s] some of the benefit [it] sought in\n\nbringing  the suit.'\"  McDonald, 884 F.2d at 1474 (quoting Nadeau\n                                                                 \n\nv. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 278-79 (1st Cir. 1978)).  The district\n           \n\ncourt determined that plaintiffs had achieved their ultimate goal\n\nof  a just  reapportionment,  based  on  the most  recent  census\n\nfigures.  It further determined that the requested attorney's and\n\nexpert fees  were reasonable.   The court therefore  awarded fees\n\nfor work  expended on both the  1980 and 1990 census  claims.  We\n\naffirm.\n\n     Defendant's  technical focus  on  the 1980  census claim  is\n\nmisguided.    Plaintiffs  sued   the  town  to  achieve   a  fair\n\napportionment  of the town's voting districts, and, at every step\n\nof  this   proceeding,  they  succeeded.     At  the  preliminary\n\ninjunction hearing, they proved  that the town's voting districts\n\nwere malapportioned under the 1980  census, and the court forbade\n\nuse  of these  districts in  the 1990  elections.  Once  the 1990\n\ncensus data became available,  plaintiffs amended their complaint\n\nand  eventually effected  redistricting based  on these  figures.\n\nThe district  court therefore  did not  abuse  its discretion  by\n\nawarding  fees  for work  expended  on  plaintiffs' original  and\n\namended claims.\n\n                               -5-\n\n     Alternatively,  the town  argues that  special circumstances\n\nrender  any award  unjust.   The town  explains that  its charter\n\nrequires  districts   based  on  the  number   of  electors,  not\n\nresidents.   Johnston Town Charter Sec. 2-6.  It therefore claims\n\nthat  it \"did  not  create  and  is  powerless  to  prevent\"  the\n\nmalapportionment.   Appellant's Brief at 18-19.  The town asserts\n\nthat  its blamelessness  is  a special  circumstance that  should\n\nrelieve  it of  the  burden of  bearing  plaintiffs' fees.    See\n                                                                 \n\nChastang v.  Flynn and Emrich Co., 541  F.2d 1040, 1045 (4th Cir.\n                                 \n\n1976) (citations omitted).\n\n     The town's argument lacks  merit.  We note that  the charter\n\nitself  requires the town to  redistrict within one  year of each\n\ncensus  and more often if necessary, yet  the town took no action\n\nuntil  it  was  sued 27  years  after  the  districts first  were\n\nestablished.2   The town clearly had the authority to reapportion\n\nthe councilmanic districts, for it drafted the redistricting plan\n\nincorporated in the consent judgment.  \n\n     Finally, the  town contends that the  district court's award\n\nof  fees  resulted from  a biased  perception  that the  town had\n\nprolonged  the litigation  needlessly  and willfully.   The  town\n\nargues that  newspaper articles critical  of its  conduct of  the\n\ncase  impermissibly influenced  the  district  court.   Defendant\n\nappends copies  of these articles to its brief on appeal.  It did\n\n                    \n\n2  On appeal, the town urges that it made attempts to correct the\nmalapportionment before this lawsuit.   The record, however, does\nnot contain any competent evidence of these attempts.  \n\n                               -6-\n\nnot  present the issue  of bias or  the articles to  the district\n\ncourt.  \n\n     We  decline to  consider the  question of  bias, for  it was\n\nraised  for the  first  time on  appeal.   See  United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nYefsky, No. 90-1174, slip op. at 22 n.7 (1st Cir. May 3, 1993).  \n      \n\nWe do  not intend, however,  for our refusal  to be  construed as\n\nconferring  merit  on  defendant's  claim.    The  town  has  not\n\npresented  a   plausible  challenge   to  the   district  court's\n\nimpartiality.\n\n     Affirmed.3\n             \n\n                    \n\n3  In its brief, the town included two pages entitled \"Appellant,\nTown  of Johnston's,  Motion  for Rehearing,\"  which purports  to\nrequest reconsideration  of the  district court's award  of fees.\nThe town has  not filed a  motion requesting this relief,  and we\ndecline to  address  its self-styled  \"motion.\"   The  issues  it\nraises, however, are identical to those raised on appeal.\n\n                               -7-\n",

The district\n           \n\ncourt determined that plaintiffs had achieved their ultimate goal\n\nof  a just  reapportionment,  based  on  the most  recent  census\n\nfigures.  It further determined that the requested attorney's and\n\nexpert fees  were reasonable.   The court therefore  awarded fees\n\nfor work  expended on both the  1980 and 1990 census  claims.  We\n\naffirm.\n\n     Defendant's  technical focus  on  the 1980  census claim  is\n\nmisguided.    Plaintiffs  sued   the  town  to  achieve   a  fair\n\napportionment  of the town's voting districts, and, at every step\n\nof  this   proceeding,  they  succeeded.     At  the  preliminary\n\ninjunction hearing, they proved  that the town's voting districts\n\nwere malapportioned under the 1980  census, and the court forbade\n\nuse  of these  districts in  the 1990  elections.  Once  the 1990\n\ncensus data became available,  plaintiffs amended their complaint\n\nand  eventually effected  redistricting based  on these  figures.\n\nThe district  court therefore  did not  abuse  its discretion  by\n\nawarding  fees  for work  expended  on  plaintiffs' original  and\n\namended claims.\n\n                               -5-\n\n     Alternatively,  the town  argues that  special circumstances\n\nrender  any award  unjust.   The town  explains that  its charter\n\nrequires  districts   based  on  the  number   of  electors,  not\n\nresidents.   Johnston Town Charter Sec. 2-6.  It therefore claims\n\nthat  it \"did  not  create  and  is  powerless  to  prevent\"  the\n\nmalapportionment.   Appellant's Brief at 18-19.  The town asserts\n\nthat  its blamelessness  is  a special  circumstance that  should\n\nrelieve  it of  the  burden of  bearing  plaintiffs' fees.    See\n                                                                 \n\nChastang v.

We note that  the charter\n\nitself  requires the town to  redistrict within one  year of each\n\ncensus  and more often if necessary, yet  the town took no action\n\nuntil  it  was  sued 27  years  after  the  districts first  were\n\nestablished.2   The town clearly had the authority to reapportion\n\nthe councilmanic districts, for it drafted the redistricting plan\n\nincorporated in the consent judgment.  \n\n     Finally, the  town contends that the  district court's award\n\nof  fees  resulted from  a biased  perception  that the  town had\n\nprolonged  the litigation  needlessly  and willfully.   The  town\n\nargues that  newspaper articles critical  of its  conduct of  the\n\ncase  impermissibly influenced  the  district  court.   Defendant\n\nappends copies  of these articles to its brief on appeal.  It did\n\n                    \n\n2  On appeal, the town urges that it made attempts to correct the\nmalapportionment before this lawsuit.   The record, however, does\nnot contain any competent evidence of these attempts.  \n\n                               -6-\n\nnot  present the issue  of bias or  the articles to  the district\n\ncourt.  \n\n     We  decline to  consider the  question of  bias, for  it was\n\nraised  for the  first  time on  appeal.   See  United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nYefsky, No. 90-1174, slip op. at 22 n.7 (1st Cir. May 3, 1993).  \n      \n\nWe do  not intend, however,  for our refusal  to be  construed as\n\nconferring  merit  on  defendant's  claim.    The  town  has  not\n\npresented  a   plausible  challenge   to  the   district  court's\n\nimpartiality.\n\n     Affirmed.3\n             \n\n                    \n\n3  In its brief, the town included two pages entitled \"Appellant,\nTown  of Johnston's,  Motion  for Rehearing,\"  which purports  to\nrequest reconsideration  of the  district court's award  of fees.\nThe town has  not filed a  motion requesting this relief,  and we\ndecline to  address  its self-styled  \"motion.\"   The  issues  it\nraises, however, are identical to those raised on appeal.\n\n                               -7-\n</pre>",
