The plane  was\n\nowned by  the Club and  was being operated  by her  then husband.\n\nThe liability insurer brought this diversity action in the United\n\nStates District Court for  the District of Massachusetts, seeking\n\na declaration that, since the victim was a \"passenger\" within the\n\nmeaning of the policy, even though  she was outside the plane  at\n\nthe  time of  the  accident, its  policy  restricted coverage  to\n\n$100,000  for any judgment that  might be recovered  in the state\n\ncourt action.  The district court granted summary judgment to the\n\ninsurer.  We affirm.\n\n                           Background  \r                                               \n\n     The undisputed facts  are that, on  December 25, 1980,  John\n\nHolden,  his then wife Deborah Crocker, appellant herein, and his\n\ntwo children  flew in a single engine Cessna from a Boston suburb\n\nto the Toronto International Airport.  The aircraft had  overhead\n\nwings and a propeller in the nose.  The plane landed at  dusk and\n\nHolden  taxied it  to an  area near  a building  in which  he saw\n\nsomeone through a lighted window.  Unable to attract attention by\n\nflashing the plane's lights,  Holden spoke with his wife  and she\n\nleft to get help from the person in the window.  The engine still\n\nrunning, she exited, leaving the door open.   She was then struck\n\nin the arm and head by the propeller.\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n     The Club's policy was issued on an insurance form that lists\n\nseven different  categories of  coverage.2  The  parties selected\n\nthe  first category,  \"combined liability  for bodily  injury and\n\nproperty  damage,\"  which  insured  against  \"claims  for  bodily\n\ninjury,  mental anguish  and damage  to someone  else's property,\n\nresulting  from   the  ownership,  maintenance  or   use  of  the\n\naircraft.\"  This insurance covered up to $1,000,000 of liability,\n\nbut  was subject to  a cap of  $100,000 per passenger.   The term\n\n\"passenger\" is  defined as  \"anyone who  enters your  aircraft to\n\nride in or operate it.\"3 \n\n     The   policy  contains   additional  language   relating  to\n\n\"passenger\" in  other options not  selected.   The second  listed\n\noption covers  bodily injury  and property damage  claims \"except\n\nbodily  injury and mental anguish  claims by a  passenger in your\n\naircraft.\"   The fourth option  covers claims \"for  bodily injury\n\nand mental anguish to any passenger in your aircraft.\"  The third\n\noption covers  claims \"for  bodily injury and  mental anguish  to\n\n                    \r                              \n\n2  The  seven  kinds  of  coverage  are  (1)  \"combined liability\ncoverage for  bodily injury  and property damage,\"  (2) \"combined\nliability coverage  for bodily injury (except  to passengers) and\nproperty damage,\"  (3) \"liability  coverage for bodily  injury to\nanyone but passengers,\" (4) \"liability coverage for bodily injury\nto  passengers  only,\"  (5)  \"liability  coverage   for  property\ndamage,\"  (6)  \"medical  coverage,\" and  (7)  \"aircraft  physical\ndamage coverage.\"\n\n3  We, like  appellee,  do not  consider  it important  that  the\ncombined  liability  coverage  option  selected does  not  itself\ncontain this definition  of passenger, which is  given in several\nof  the more  narrow categories  of coverage  listed.   Since the\ncombined liability  coverage is merely  an amalgam  of the  risks\ncovered  by the  narrower  categories, by  implication, the  same\ndefinition of passenger applies.\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nanyone -- except a passenger -- who is injured.\"   The phrase \"in\n\nyour  aircraft,\"  present  in  the former  two  options,  is  not\n\nincluded in the latter.\n\n                    Applicable Legal Standards\r                                                        \n\n     The issue of choice  of law was apparently not  addressed by\n\nthe  parties  or  the court  below,  but,  since  the policy  was\n\ndelivered  to  the  Club  in  Massachusetts, which  is  also  the\n\ndomicile of  insureds  and claimant,  we  shall assume  that  the\n\nsubstantive  law  of  that  commonwealth applies.    We  suspect,\n\nhowever, that in  general there is  no relevant difference  among\n\njurisdictions.  Our review of  the propriety of summary judgment,\n\nin the absence of any factual dispute, is of course plenary.  \n\n     In interpreting the  insurance policy at issue in this case,\n\nwe  apply the  three fundamental  principles articulated  in Camp\r                                                                           \n\nDresser &amp;  McKee, Inc. v. Home  Ins. Co., 30 Mass.  App. Ct. 318,\r                                                  \n\n323-24, 568 N.E.2d 631 (1991): we  construe the policy \"according\n\nto the  fair  and reasonable  meaning  of its  words,\"  interpret\n\nexclusionary  clauses  against  the  insurer,  and   resolve  all\n\nambiguities  against  the  insurer.    These  tasks  of  contract\n\ninterpretation, including the  determination of ambiguity  or its\n\nlack, are matters  for the court.  Boston Edison Co. v. F.E.R.C.,\r                                                                          \n\n856 F.2d  361, 365  (1st Cir.  1988) (referring to  Massachusetts\n\ncases).\n\n     When,  as  here,  both  parties earnestly  contend  that  an\n\ninsurance  policy   is  clear,  unambiguous,  with   a  fair  and\n\nreasonable  meaning exactly  opposite to  that advanced  by their\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nadversary,  a court  is tempted  to say  that, whatever  a policy\n\nreally  means, it is at least ambiguous.   But the discernment of\n\ntwo possible  meanings for a  word is not  the end of  a judicial\n\nassessment of ambiguity.  As we have said: \n\n     Lack of ambiguity is a relative status, not an absolute\n     one.   The  parties need  not choose  phraseology which\n     invariably excludes every possible interpretation other\n     than  the one they intend.  [I]t [is] sufficient if the\n     language  employed is  such that  a  reasonable person,\n     reading  the  document  as  a whole  and  in  realistic\n     context,  clearly  points  to  a  readily ascertainable\n     meaning.\n\nFashion House,  Inc. v. K  Mart Corp., 892  F.2d 1076, 1085  (1st\r                                               \n\nCir. 1989).\n\n                            Analysis  \r                                              \n\n     Appellant  would have us  quickly assume that,  based on its\n\ndictionary  definition,  the word  \"passenger\" under  this policy\n\nmeans someone who has entered the aircraft to ride in  or operate\n\nit and who is in the aircraft at  the time of injury.  If one  is\r                \n\noutside,  no  matter  how near  or  far,  and  regardless if  the\n\nseparation from the  aircraft is recent  or remote, transient  or\n\npermanent,  or  involuntary  or  voluntary, one  is  no  longer a\n\n\"passenger.\"    There is,  indeed,  literary  precedent for  such\n\nliteral and  narrow reading: Portia, a  \"rightful judge,\" refused\n\nto expand  \"a pound of flesh\" to authorize the shedding of even a\n\n\"jot of blood.\"4  \n\n     But we lack the playwright's license.  Literal exactitude is\n\nnot the end of our  quest.  In Hazen Paper Co. v. U.S. Fidelity &amp;\r                                                                           \n                    \r                              \n\n4 William Shakespeare, The  Merchant of Venice, Act IV,  Scene 1,\r                                                        \nlines 306-313.\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nGuar. Co.,  407 Mass.  689, 693, 555  N.E.2d 576,  579 (1990),  a\r                   \n\nliability policy  required the  insurance company \"to  defend any\n\nsuit seeking damages  on account of . . .  property damage.\"  The\n\ninsured had  been accused of releasing  hazardous substances into\n\nthe environment.  The threshold  issue confronting the court  was\n\nwhether a letter from  the Environmental Protection Agency naming\n\nthe  insured   as  a   \"potentially  responsible  person\"   [PRP]\n\nconstituted a \"suit.\"  The court reasoned:\n\n     Obviously, on  the record no lawsuit  has been brought.\n     Literally,  there is no suit.  That fact alone has been\n     sufficient  to  provide  the  answer for  some  courts.\n     [Citations omitted.]  It is, however, not sufficient to\n     provide an answer for us.\n\nId.  After  surveying the importance to the  insured of the early\r             \n\ninvolvement  of  the  insurer on  receipt  of  a  PRP letter,  it\n\nconcluded that  \"[t]he  consequences of  the receipt  of the  EPA\n\nletter were  so substantially equivalent to the commencement of a\n\nlawsuit that  a duty to defend  arose immediately.\"  Id.  at 696,\r                                                                  \n\n555 N.E.2d at 581. \n\n     Similarly, our focus  must be the broader  one of discerning\n\nthe  parties' reasonable  expectations from  the context  and the\n\npurposes sought to be served.   As the Hazen Paper court  put it,\r                                                            \n\n\"[i]t is . . . appropriate, in construing an insurance policy, to\n\nconsider  what an  objectively  reasonable  insured, reading  the\n\nrelevant  policy language, would expect  to be covered.\"   Id. at\r                                                                       \n\n700, 555  N.E.2d at  583.   Accordingly, both  to probe fair  and\n\nreasonable  meaning  and to  test for  ambiguity, we  examine the\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nactual  language  used,  the  context,  the  parties'  reasonable\n\nexpectations, and the relevant cases.  \n\n     The  policy definition  of passenger  -- \"anyone  who enters\n\nyour aircraft to ride in or operate it\" -- does not carry us very\n\nfar.  Indeed, on its  face, it does not seem to  contemplate that\n\nthe  status of passenger ever  terminates.  We  are confident the\n\nparties  did  not  intend  that,  under   this  policy,  once  an\n\nindividual entered the insureds'  aircraft, she would remain, for\n\nall time, a passenger.\n\n     The  context in  which the policy  was written,  however, is\n\ndecidedly  more illuminating.    This is  a  two tier  policy  of\n\nliability  insurance  for a  recreational  flying  group and  its\n\nmembers.  It protects the insureds for up to one hundred thousand\n\ndollars  against claims by  individual passengers  and up  to one\n\nmillion  dollars  against  claims   by  non-passengers.    As  we\n\ncontemplate what  the parties  must reasonably have  intended and\n\nexpected,  we readily  assume that  they were  aware of  the full\n\nrange  of possible injuries that could befall members of the Club\n\nand  their  guests, including  possible  injury or  death  due to\n\nemergency landings  or accidents involving maintenance  work.  We\n\nalso assume they knew the risks of injuries to other aircraft and\n\ntheir owners, operators, and passengers, visitors to the airport,\n\nlicensees,  workmen, and all  third parties.   Finally, we assume\n\nthat  keeping   down  the  cost  of  premiums  was  an  important\n\nconsideration in choosing to cover claims by passengers up to one\n\nhundred thousand dollars instead of up to one million dollars.\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n     In  this context,  we  cannot  believe  that the  Club,  its\n\nmembers,  or the  insurer could  have intended  that members  and\n\ntheir  guests could  suddenly  find themselves  eligible for  the\n\nmillion  dollar  coverage because  they  were forced  to  exit an\n\naircraft by parachute and subsequently were injured or killed, or\n\nbecause  they  suffered  some  injury  or  anguish  while  making\n\nemergency  repairs  in flight,  or while  trying to  remove wheel\n\nblocks or adjust a  propeller before takeoff, or, as  here, while\n\ntemporarily leaving the plane to get assistance prior to securing\n\nthe  aircraft for  the  night.    Conversely, if  only  passenger\n\ncoverage had been purchased and  the same situations occurred, we\n\ndoubt  very much that the parties would expect to find themselves\n\ndeprived of coverage.   We  conclude that there  is a  reasonable\n\nexpectation that \"passenger\" implies some  necessary, unavoidable\n\nor frequently encountered situations occurring in connection with\n\nand in proximity to, but outside, an aircraft.5  \n\n     What we described  as our  sense of the  situation is  amply\n\nborne out by the cases, some of them going back to the 'twenties.\n\nSimilar  language as  that  in  the  policy  at  issue  has  been\n\nconstrued  to apply to persons who, during a journey by aircraft,\n\nhad  occasion  to  approach  the  plane  and  collided  with  the\n                    \r                              \n\n5  It is true that the phrase \"in  your aircraft\" is found in two\nof the (not selected)  coverage descriptions.  See supra  at 3-4.\r                                                                  \nBut it seems likely to  have been inserted to emphasize  that the\nlimitation does not apply  to passengers in another aircraft  who\r                                                             \nhave been  injured.  And, as we have  noted, the clause is not to\nbe  found  in a  companion  clause offering  coverage  for bodily\ninjury   to  anyone  but  passengers.     There  is  no  rational\nexplanation for this varying treatment and we therefore assign no\nother significance to the phrase.\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\npropeller.   In Pittman v.

Audette,  307 Mass. 111, 29 N.E.2d  707 (1940),\r                                   \n\nthe  driver of  the  vehicle gave  plaintiff  a ride  home.   The\n\nplaintiff wanted to stop to buy sandwiches for both to eat at her\n\nhome.   They stopped at a restaurant; plaintiff walked toward it,\n\nthen back  to the  car to  persuade the driver  to join  her; the\n\nmotor  running,   the  car  slipped  into   reverse  and  injured\n\nplaintiff, whose  foot was on the running  board.  The court held\n\nthat  \"[t]he stop,  which  was  for  a  common  purpose,  was  an\n\nincidental  part  of  the  transportation,  and  a  part  of  the\n\nundertaking.\"   Id.  at 113,  29  N.E.2d at  708.   Similarly, in\r                             \n\nBragdon  v.

Scardino,  334  Mass. 178,  134\r                                                    \n\nN.E.2d  444 (1956),  plaintiff helped  the driver  change  a flat\n\ntire.  He was held still to be an \"occupant\" of the vehicle.  The\n\nfact that plaintiff was  not in defendant's vehicle when  injured\n\nwas not material.   \"Both were in its immediate  vicinity engaged\n\nin activities designed to promote a  resumption of its use.\"  Id.\r                                                                           \n\nat 182, 134 N.E.2d at 446. \n\n     In  sum, we  feel  that the  Massachusetts Supreme  Judicial\n\nCourt  would  apply  similar  reasoning  in  determining  whether\n\nappellant  in the case  at bar had  lost her status  as passenger\n\nbecause  she had left the  aircraft momentarily to  seek help and\n\nwas injured almost immediately.\n\n     We have searched for contraindications of these authorities,\n\nancient as  some may be.   Appellant has not favored  us with any\n\ncases  where, in like situations, the narrowest of definitions of\n\n\"passenger\"  or  similar  words   has  been  applied  to  exclude\n\nnecessary or  predictable events so closely tied  to the original\n\nstatus.   She  has argued  mainly against  relying on  precedents\n\nconstruing cases  decided under the Warsaw  Convention and common\n\ncarrier cases where pro-passenger public policy may have played a\n\nmajor role.  We have not relied on any.\n\n     As  for  appellant's urging  that  we  construe exclusionary\n\nclauses against the  insurer, we  observe that  this policy  form\n\ncontains certain options covering passengers and certain  options\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\ncovering  non-passengers.   If the insureds  had chosen  only the\n\noption  covering passengers,  it  could not  be  argued that  the\n\npolicy  provision  that  was  the  source  of  protection was  an\n\nexclusion.   The same  reasoning applies  to the policy  actually\n\nchosen, which combines extensive coverage for non-passengers with\n\nmore  limited   coverage  for  passengers.     The  coverage  for\n\npassengers is not  subject to the  special rules of  construction\n\nfor policy exclusions.\n\n     We therefore, after this considerable journey, conclude that\n\nthe policy language  at issue is not, in law, ambiguous, and that\n\nits  fair and  reasonable purport  is to  include appellant  as a\n\n\"passenger\"  at  the  time  of  her  unfortunate  accident.   The\n\njudgment of the district court is\n\n     AFFIRMED. \n\n                               -14-\r\r\n",

The plane was owned by the Club and was being operated by her then husband.  The liability insurer brought this diversity action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, seeking a declaration that, since the victim was a \"passenger\" within the meaning of the policy, even though she was outside the plane at the time of the accident, its policy restricted coverage to $100,000 for any judgment that might be recovered in the state court action.  The district court granted summary judgment to the insurer.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The undisputed facts are that, on December 25, 1980, John Holden, his then wife Deborah Crocker, appellant herein, and his two children flew in a single engine Cessna from a Boston suburb to the Toronto International Airport.  The aircraft had overhead wings and a propeller in the nose.  The plane landed at dusk and Holden taxied it to an area near a building in which he saw someone through a lighted window.  Unable to attract attention by flashing the plane's lights, Holden spoke with his wife and she left to get help from the person in the window.  The engine still running, she exited, leaving the door open.  She was then struck in the arm and head by the propeller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Club's policy was issued on an insurance form that lists seven different categories of coverage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The parties selected the first category, \"combined liability for bodily injury and property damage,\" which insured against \"claims for bodily injury, mental anguish and damage to someone else's property, resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of the aircraft.\"   This insurance covered up to $1,000,000 of liability, but was subject to a cap of $100,000 per passenger.  The term \"passenger\" is defined as \"anyone who enters your aircraft to ride in or operate it.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy contains additional language relating to \"passenger\" in other options not selected.  The second listed option covers bodily injury and property damage claims \"except bodily injury and mental anguish claims by a passenger in your aircraft.\"   The fourth option covers claims \"for bodily injury and mental anguish to any passenger in your aircraft.\"   The third option covers claims \"for bodily injury and mental anguish to anyone--except a passenger--who is injured.\"   The phrase \"in your aircraft,\" present in the former two options, is not included in the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Applicable Legal Standards</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of choice of law was apparently not addressed by the parties or the court below, but, since the policy was delivered to the Club in Massachusetts, which is also the domicile of insureds and claimant, we shall assume that the substantive law of that commonwealth applies.  We suspect, however, that in general there is no relevant difference among jurisdictions.  Our review of the propriety of summary judgment, in the absence of any factual dispute, is of course plenary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In interpreting the insurance policy at issue in this case, we apply the three fundamental principles articulated in Camp Dresser &amp; McKee, Inc. v. Home Ins. Co., 30 Mass.App.Ct. 318, 323-24, 568 N.E.2d 631 (1991):  we construe the policy \"according to the fair and reasonable meaning of its words,\" interpret exclusionary clauses against the insurer, and resolve all ambiguities against the insurer.  These tasks of contract interpretation, including the determination of ambiguity or its lack, are matters for the court.  Boston Edison Co. v. F.E.R.C., 856 F.2d 361, 365 (1st Cir.1988) (referring to Massachusetts cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, as here, both parties earnestly contend that an insurance policy is clear, unambiguous, with a fair and reasonable meaning exactly opposite to that advanced by their adversary, a court is tempted to say that, whatever a policy really means, it is at least ambiguous.  But the discernment of two possible meanings for a word is not the end of a judicial assessment of ambiguity.  As we have said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Lack of ambiguity is a relative status, not an absolute one.  The parties need not choose phraseology which invariably excludes every possible interpretation other than the one they intend.  [I]t [is] sufficient if the language employed is such that a reasonable person, reading the document as a whole and in realistic context, clearly points to a readily ascertainable meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fashion House, Inc. v. K Mart Corp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1085 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant would have us quickly assume that, based on its dictionary definition, the word \"passenger\" under this policy means someone who has entered the aircraft to ride in or operate it and who is in the aircraft at the time of injury.  If one is outside, no matter how near or far, and regardless if the separation from the aircraft is recent or remote, transient or permanent, or involuntary or voluntary, one is no longer a \"passenger.\"   There is, indeed, literary precedent for such literal and narrow reading:  Portia, a \"rightful judge,\" refused to expand \"a pound of flesh\" to authorize the shedding of even a \"jot of blood.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But we lack the playwright's license.  Literal exactitude is not the end of our quest.  In Hazen Paper Co. v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 407 Mass. 689, 693, 555 N.E.2d 576, 579 (1990), a liability policy required the insurance company \"to defend any suit seeking damages on account of ... property damage.\"   The insured had been accused of releasing hazardous substances into the environment.  The threshold issue confronting the court was whether a letter from the Environmental Protection Agency naming the insured as a \"potentially responsible person\" [PRP] constituted a \"suit.\"   The court reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>Obviously, on the record no lawsuit has been brought.  Literally, there is no suit.  That fact alone has been sufficient to provide the answer for some courts.  [Citations omitted.]  It is, however, not sufficient to provide an answer for us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.  After surveying the importance to the insured of the early involvement of the insurer on receipt of a PRP letter, it concluded that \"[t]he consequences of the receipt of the EPA letter were so substantially equivalent to the commencement of a lawsuit that a duty to defend arose immediately.\"  Id. at 696, 555 N.E.2d at 581.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, our focus must be the broader one of discerning the parties' reasonable expectations from the context and the purposes sought to be served.  As the Hazen Paper court put it, \"[i]t is ... appropriate, in construing an insurance policy, to consider what an objectively reasonable insured, reading the relevant policy language, would expect to be covered.\"  Id. at 700, 555 N.E.2d at 583.   Accordingly, both to probe fair and reasonable meaning and to test for ambiguity, we examine the actual language used, the context, the parties' reasonable expectations, and the relevant cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy definition of passenger--\"anyone who enters your aircraft to ride in or operate it\"--does not carry us very far.  Indeed, on its face, it does not seem to contemplate that the status of passenger ever terminates.  We are confident the parties did not intend that, under this policy, once an individual entered the insureds' aircraft, she would remain, for all time, a passenger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The context in which the policy was written, however, is decidedly more illuminating.  This is a two tier policy of liability insurance for a recreational flying group and its members.  It protects the insureds for up to one hundred thousand dollars against claims by individual passengers and up to one million dollars against claims by non-passengers.  As we contemplate what the parties must reasonably have intended and expected, we readily assume that they were aware of the full range of possible injuries that could befall members of the Club and their guests, including possible injury or death due to emergency landings or accidents involving maintenance work.  We also assume they knew the risks of injuries to other aircraft and their owners, operators, and passengers, visitors to the airport, licensees, workmen, and all third parties.  Finally, we assume that keeping down the cost of premiums was an important consideration in choosing to cover claims by passengers up to one hundred thousand dollars instead of up to one million dollars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this context, we cannot believe that the Club, its members, or the insurer could have intended that members and their guests could suddenly find themselves eligible for the million dollar coverage because they were forced to exit an aircraft by parachute and subsequently were injured or killed, or because they suffered some injury or anguish while making emergency repairs in flight, or while trying to remove wheel blocks or adjust a propeller before takeoff, or, as here, while temporarily leaving the plane to get assistance prior to securing the aircraft for the night.  Conversely, if only passenger coverage had been purchased and the same situations occurred, we doubt very much that the parties would expect to find themselves deprived of coverage.  We conclude that there is a reasonable expectation that \"passenger\" implies some necessary, unavoidable or frequently encountered situations occurring in connection with and in proximity to, but outside, an aircraft.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What we described as our sense of the situation is amply borne out by the cases, some of them going back to the 'twenties.  Similar language as that in the policy at issue has been construed to apply to persons who, during a journey by aircraft, had occasion to approach the plane and collided with the propeller.  In Pittman v. Lamar Life Ins. Co., 17 F.2d 370 (5th Cir.1927), a co-owner of an aircraft, which stopped near a hangar with its engine running, got out, walked toward his automobile, and was struck by the propeller and killed.  The life insurance policy contained a provision that limited benefits in the event that death was caused by \"participating in aeronautical activity.\"   The court held that \"aeronautical activities of one who takes [an airplane] trip ... includes his presence or movements in or near to the machine incidental to beginning or concluding the trip\" and that the activity in this case was so \"connected with and incidental to the airplane trip.\"  Id. at 371.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The narrow term, \"riding in\" an aircraft, was held to include one who jumped or was thrown from it in Willingham v. Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. of Tenn., 216 F.2d 226, 228 (5th Cir.1954).  The court said, \"[w]e think that the phrase 'riding in' in the context here employed is unambiguous and clearly includes falling or being thrown from the airplane because of difficulties in flight.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similarly narrow definition contained in a policy exclusion (injury sustained \"while in or on any vehicle ... for aerial navigation\") was held to apply to a death by drowning after a forced landing on water in Wendorff v. Missouri State Life Ins. Co., 318 Mo. 363, 366-67, 1 S.W.2d 99, 100 (1927).  Almost forty years later, in a case involving a crash during takeoff near a lake, the Ninth Circuit similarly ruled, under policy language covering death from \"operating or serving as a member of a crew of an aircraft.\"  Rauch v. Underwriters at Lloyd's of London, 320 F.2d 525, 526 (9th Cir.1963).  The court held that the \"aeronautical activities of decedent Rauch did not end with the actual flight ... but included his voluntary or involuntary presence and movements in the lake water near the plane following its crash.\"  Id. at 531.   In short, \"operating\" included something following actual operation of the plane.  Other cases recognizing risks of drowning as familiar risks of aviation are Green v. Mutual Benefit Life Ins. Co., 144 F.2d 55 (1st Cir.1944), and Neel v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 131 F.2d 159 (2d Cir.1942).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the activity in which appellant was engaged was not reembarking or parachuting or struggling in the water after a crash but, more like that in Pittman, even more tied to trying to bring about the successful end of the flight, to obtain assistance before securing the aircraft.  The concept of coverage for one who was injured while assisting the transportation enterprise was articulated in Emerson v. Carolina Cas. Ins. Co., 206 F.2d 13 (8th Cir.1953), where a passenger in a truck had been asked by the driver to help uncouple a trailer and was then injured.  The court denied him the status of guest passenger because it was not reasonable that a guest passenger would be instructed to do something that was normally done by the operator at the end of a journey.

Langelier leads us to a number of Massachusetts cases dealing with a related question:  when does the status of a guest passenger in another's automobile cease for purposes of determining the driver's duty of care in tort suits?   In Ruel, the defendant offered plaintiff a ride home, but, because his car was stuck in the snow, he first elicited her help in pushing the car free.  She was injured in the attempt.  The court found that, though she was outside the car at the time of the injury, she was still his guest.  Ruel v.

They stopped at a restaurant;  plaintiff walked toward it, then back to the car to persuade the driver to join her;  the motor running, the car slipped into reverse and injured plaintiff, whose foot was on the running board.  The court held that \"[t]he stop, which was for a common purpose, was an incidental part of the transportation, and a part of the undertaking.\"  Id. at 113, 29 N.E.2d at 708.   Similarly, in Bragdon v. Dinsmore, 312 Mass. 628, 630, 45 N.E.2d 833 (1942), helping a driver park a vehicle was held to be \"necessarily incidental to the accomplishment of the gratuitous undertaking, in order to carry out its prearranged purpose.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in Sutherland v.

Appellant has not favored us with any cases where, in like situations, the narrowest of definitions of \"passenger\" or similar words has been applied to exclude necessary or predictable events so closely tied to the original status.  She has argued mainly against relying on precedents construing cases decided under the Warsaw Convention and common carrier cases where pro-passenger public policy may have played a major role.

If the insureds had chosen only the option covering passengers, it could not be argued that the policy provision that was the source of protection was an exclusion.  The same reasoning applies to the policy actually chosen, which combines extensive coverage for non-passengers with more limited coverage for passengers.  The coverage for passengers is not subject to the special rules of construction for policy exclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore, after this considerable journey, conclude that the policy language at issue is not, in law, ambiguous, and that its fair and reasonable purport is to include appellant as a \"passenger\" at the time of her unfortunate accident.

The plane was owned by the Club and was being operated by her then husband.  The liability insurer brought this diversity action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, seeking a declaration that, since the victim was a \"passenger\" within the meaning of the policy, even though she was outside the plane at the time of the accident, its policy restricted coverage to $100,000 for any judgment that might be recovered in the state court action.  The district court granted summary judgment to the insurer.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The undisputed facts are that, on December 25, 1980, John Holden, his then wife Deborah Crocker, appellant herein, and his two children flew in a single engine Cessna from a Boston suburb to the Toronto International Airport.  The aircraft had overhead wings and a propeller in the nose.  The plane landed at dusk and Holden taxied it to an area near a building in which he saw someone through a lighted window.  Unable to attract attention by flashing the plane's lights, Holden spoke with his wife and she left to get help from the person in the window.  The engine still running, she exited, leaving the door open.  She was then struck in the arm and head by the propeller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Club's policy was issued on an insurance form that lists seven different categories of coverage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The parties selected the first category, \"combined liability for bodily injury and property damage,\" which insured against \"claims for bodily injury, mental anguish and damage to someone else's property, resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of the aircraft.\"   This insurance covered up to $1,000,000 of liability, but was subject to a cap of $100,000 per passenger.  The term \"passenger\" is defined as \"anyone who enters your aircraft to ride in or operate it.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy contains additional language relating to \"passenger\" in other options not selected.  The second listed option covers bodily injury and property damage claims \"except bodily injury and mental anguish claims by a passenger in your aircraft.\"   The fourth option covers claims \"for bodily injury and mental anguish to any passenger in your aircraft.\"   The third option covers claims \"for bodily injury and mental anguish to anyone--except a passenger--who is injured.\"   The phrase \"in your aircraft,\" present in the former two options, is not included in the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Applicable Legal Standards</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of choice of law was apparently not addressed by the parties or the court below, but, since the policy was delivered to the Club in Massachusetts, which is also the domicile of insureds and claimant, we shall assume that the substantive law of that commonwealth applies.  We suspect, however, that in general there is no relevant difference among jurisdictions.  Our review of the propriety of summary judgment, in the absence of any factual dispute, is of course plenary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In interpreting the insurance policy at issue in this case, we apply the three fundamental principles articulated in Camp Dresser &amp; McKee, Inc. v.

These tasks of contract interpretation, including the determination of ambiguity or its lack, are matters for the court.  Boston Edison Co. v. F.E.R.C., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511559\"><a href=\"/opinion/511559/boston-edison-company-v-federal-energy-regulatory-commission-city-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">856</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span>, 365 (1st Cir.1988) (referring to Massachusetts cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, as here, both parties earnestly contend that an insurance policy is clear, unambiguous, with a fair and reasonable meaning exactly opposite to that advanced by their adversary, a court is tempted to say that, whatever a policy really means, it is at least ambiguous.  But the discernment of two possible meanings for a word is not the end of a judicial assessment of ambiguity.  As we have said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Lack of ambiguity is a relative status, not an absolute one.  The parties need not choose phraseology which invariably excludes every possible interpretation other than the one they intend.

If one is outside, no matter how near or far, and regardless if the separation from the aircraft is recent or remote, transient or permanent, or involuntary or voluntary, one is no longer a \"passenger.\"   There is, indeed, literary precedent for such literal and narrow reading:  Portia, a \"rightful judge,\" refused to expand \"a pound of flesh\" to authorize the shedding of even a \"jot of blood.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But we lack the playwright's license.

The threshold issue confronting the court was whether a letter from the Environmental Protection Agency naming the insured as a \"potentially responsible person\" [PRP] constituted a \"suit.\"   The court reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>Obviously, on the record no lawsuit has been brought.

As the Hazen Paper court put it, \"[i]t is ... appropriate, in construing an insurance policy, to consider what an objectively reasonable insured, reading the relevant policy language, would expect to be covered.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2088528\"><a href=\"/opinion/2088528/hazen-paper-co-v-united-states-fidelity-guar-co/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 700, </a></span>555 N.E.2d at 583.   Accordingly, both to probe fair and reasonable meaning and to test for ambiguity, we examine the actual language used, the context, the parties' reasonable expectations, and the relevant cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy definition of passenger--\"anyone who enters your aircraft to ride in or operate it\"--does not carry us very far.  Indeed, on its face, it does not seem to contemplate that the status of passenger ever terminates.  We are confident the parties did not intend that, under this policy, once an individual entered the insureds' aircraft, she would remain, for all time, a passenger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The context in which the policy was written, however, is decidedly more illuminating.  This is a two tier policy of liability insurance for a recreational flying group and its members.  It protects the insureds for up to one hundred thousand dollars against claims by individual passengers and up to one million dollars against claims by non-passengers.  As we contemplate what the parties must reasonably have intended and expected, we readily assume that they were aware of the full range of possible injuries that could befall members of the Club and their guests, including possible injury or death due to emergency landings or accidents involving maintenance work.  We also assume they knew the risks of injuries to other aircraft and their owners, operators, and passengers, visitors to the airport, licensees, workmen, and all third parties.  Finally, we assume that keeping down the cost of premiums was an important consideration in choosing to cover claims by passengers up to one hundred thousand dollars instead of up to one million dollars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this context, we cannot believe that the Club, its members, or the insurer could have intended that members and their guests could suddenly find themselves eligible for the million dollar coverage because they were forced to exit an aircraft by parachute and subsequently were injured or killed, or because they suffered some injury or anguish while making emergency repairs in flight, or while trying to remove wheel blocks or adjust a propeller before takeoff, or, as here, while temporarily leaving the plane to get assistance prior to securing the aircraft for the night.  Conversely, if only passenger coverage had been purchased and the same situations occurred, we doubt very much that the parties would expect to find themselves deprived of coverage.  We conclude that there is a reasonable expectation that \"passenger\" implies some necessary, unavoidable or frequently encountered situations occurring in connection with and in proximity to, but outside, an aircraft.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What we described as our sense of the situation is amply borne out by the cases, some of them going back to the 'twenties.  Similar language as that in the policy at issue has been construed to apply to persons who, during a journey by aircraft, had occasion to approach the plane and collided with the propeller.

The life insurance policy contained a provision that limited benefits in the event that death was caused by \"participating in aeronautical activity.\"   The court held that \"aeronautical activities of one who takes [an airplane] trip ... includes his presence or movements in or near to the machine incidental to beginning or concluding the trip\" and that the activity in this case was so \"connected with and incidental to the airplane trip.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1487929\"><a href=\"/opinion/1487929/pittman-v-lamar-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 371.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The narrow term, \"riding in\" an aircraft, was held to include one who jumped or was thrown from it in Willingham v.

The concept of coverage for one who was injured while assisting the transportation enterprise was articulated in Emerson v. Carolina Cas. Ins.

The court denied him the status of guest passenger because it was not reasonable that a guest passenger would be instructed to do something that was normally done by the operator at the end of a journey.  But it said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>If what Goodman was doing at the time of his injury was a reasonable incident to his relationship of the kind of passenger he initially was, he will continue to be a passenger although not physically in or upon the vehicle.

Langelier leads us to a number of Massachusetts cases dealing with a related question:  when does the status of a guest passenger in another's automobile cease for purposes of determining the driver's duty of care in tort suits?   In Ruel, the defendant offered plaintiff a ride home, but, because his car was stuck in the snow, he first elicited her help in pushing the car free.  She was injured in the attempt.  The court found that, though she was outside the car at the time of the injury, she was still his guest.

The plaintiff wanted to stop to buy sandwiches for both to eat at her home.  They stopped at a restaurant;  plaintiff walked toward it, then back to the car to persuade the driver to join her;  the motor running, the car slipped into reverse and injured plaintiff, whose foot was on the running board.

He was held still to be an \"occupant\" of the vehicle.  The fact that plaintiff was not in defendant's vehicle when injured was not material.  \"Both were in its immediate vicinity engaged in activities designed to promote a resumption of its use.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2064345\"><a href=\"/opinion/2064345/sutherland-v-scardino/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 182, </a></span>134 N.E.2d at 446.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we feel that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court would apply similar reasoning in determining whether appellant in the case at bar had lost her status as passenger because she had left the aircraft momentarily to seek help and was injured almost immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have searched for contraindications of these authorities, ancient as some may be.  Appellant has not favored us with any cases where, in like situations, the narrowest of definitions of \"passenger\" or similar words has been applied to exclude necessary or predictable events so closely tied to the original status.  She has argued mainly against relying on precedents construing cases decided under the Warsaw Convention and common carrier cases where pro-passenger public policy may have played a major role.  We have not relied on any.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for appellant's urging that we construe exclusionary clauses against the insurer, we observe that this policy form contains certain options covering passengers and certain options covering non-passengers.  If the insureds had chosen only the option covering passengers, it could not be argued that the policy provision that was the source of protection was an exclusion.  The same reasoning applies to the policy actually chosen, which combines extensive coverage for non-passengers with more limited coverage for passengers.  The coverage for passengers is not subject to the special rules of construction for policy exclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore, after this considerable journey, conclude that the policy language at issue is not, in law, ambiguous, and that its fair and reasonable purport is to include appellant as a \"passenger\" at the time of her unfortunate accident.  The judgment of the district court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Judge Campbell heard oral argument in this matter but did not participate in the drafting or the issuance of the panel's opinion.  The remaining two panelists therefore issue this opinion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 46(d)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The seven kinds of coverage are (1) \"combined liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage,\" (2) \"combined liability coverage for bodily injury (except to passengers) and property damage,\" (3) \"liability coverage for bodily injury to anyone but passengers,\" (4) \"liability coverage for bodily injury to passengers only,\" (5) \"liability coverage for property damage,\" (6) \"medical coverage,\" and (7) \"aircraft physical damage coverage.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We, like appellee, do not consider it important that the combined liability coverage option selected does not itself contain this definition of passenger, which is given in several of the more narrow categories of coverage listed.  Since the combined liability coverage is merely an amalgam of the risks covered by the narrower categories, by implication, the same definition of passenger applies</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> William Shakespeare, The Merchant of Venice, Act IV, Scene 1, lines 306-313</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> It is true that the phrase \"in your aircraft\" is found in two of the (not selected) coverage descriptions.  See supra at 85-86.  But it seems likely to have been inserted to emphasize that the limitation does not apply to passengers in another aircraft who have been injured.  And, as we have noted, the clause is not to be found in a companion clause offering coverage for bodily injury to anyone but passengers.  There is no rational explanation for this varying treatment and we therefore assign no other significance to the phrase</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
