See United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.  Mena-Robles, 4  F.3d 1026, 1029  (1st Cir.  1993),\n                      \n\ncert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1550 (1994).\n            \n\n          Confidential  informant  Ruben de  los  Santos (the\n\nCI)1  worked on  board the  merchant vessel  Euro-Colombia, a\n\nship  which  routinely travels  between  Colombia  and Puerto\n\nRico.   In  December  of  1991,  the  CI  was  approached  in\n\nCartagena, Colombia, by  a Mr.  Marcial who asked  the CI  to\n\nsmuggle four  kilograms of cocaine on  the Euro-Colombia from\n\nColombia  to Puerto Rico.  Marcial gave the CI the contraband\n\nand a phone number to call when the ship reached Puerto Rico.\n\nThe  phone number was later determined to be a cellular phone\n\nnumber assigned to Ayala.\n\n          In early January,  the ship arrived in  Ponce.  The\n\nCI called the number  and received no answer.   United States\n\n                    \n\n1.  The CI is no relation to defendant Kim de los Santos.\n\n                             -3-\n\nCustoms   agents,   with  whom   the   CI   was  cooperating,\n\nphotographed the drugs and  then allowed the CI to  return to\n\nColombia with the contraband.  In Colombia, Marcial asked the\n\nCI to  try delivering the drugs  again and gave the  CI a new\n\ntelephone number to call.   \n\n          In  February, the  ship arrived  at Ponce  a second\n\ntime.  At 3:30 in the morning, the CI called  the new number.\n\nThe resulting conversation was taped by United States Customs\n\nofficials.    Santos answered  the phone.    The CI  began by\n\nasking  if Santos knew \"Mr.  Estela,\" and said  that he had a\n\n\"present\"  for  Santos.   Santos  replied  that  he knew  Mr.\n\nEstela.   The word cocaine was  not mentioned, but a price of\n\n$4000  per kilogram  was agreed upon.   A time  and place for\n\ndelivery were set.  Santos said  that he would arrive at 5:00\n\na.m. in Ponce  and that he  would be driving a  gold Porsche.\n\nHe  also mentioned  that  he needed  to  raise cash  for  the\n\npurchase.\n\n          A  second phone call was made to the same number at\n\nabout 4:00 a.m., which  was also taped by  customs officials.\n\nThis time, the CI spoke  with Torres.  The delivery time  was\n\nmoved back to 8:00  a.m.  Torres stated, among  other things,\n\nthat he needed the time to raise money. \n\n          At 8:00  a.m., Santos and  Torres showed up  at the\n\nappointed delivery  spot.  They  were riding in  a Mitsubishi\n\nMirage,  not a Porsche.  Ayala, the third defendant, was also\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nwith them.  Santos signaled to the CI, who  replied by asking\n\nwhat  Santos  wanted.   Santos  replied,  \"The  4 kilos  from\n\nColombia.\"   The CI asked to  be paid.  Ayala  opened the car\n\ndoor,  Santos told  the CI to  get into  the car,  and the CI\n\nobliged.    All  three   defendants  were  arrested   shortly\n\nthereafter.   In the car, agents discovered a car phone, with\n\nthe  very phone  number that  the CI  had called,  along with\n\n$3970 in  cash.  Torres was  carrying over $500 in  cash.  In\n\naddition,  Santos' key  chain  had a  Porsche  emblem on  it.\n\nAyala also had a beeper on his person. \n\n          All three defendants were held for several hours by\n\ncustoms officials  without being read their Miranda warnings.\n\nDuring  those  hours, all  were  questioned.   United  States\n\nCustoms  Service Agent  Radames  Sanchez, who  had taped  the\n\nconversations  earlier that  morning,2 then  listened briefly\n\nto the questions  being asked defendants in order to identify\n\ntheir voices.  He determined that Santos' voice was the voice\n\nhe heard  on  the tape  of  the first  phone  call, and  that\n\nTorres' voice was the one he heard on the tape  of the second\n\ncall.  \n\n          Santos  and  Torres  were   charged  with  using  a\n\n\"communication facility\" in  carrying out a drug  transaction\n\n                    \n\n2.  Santos argues in  his brief  that Agent  Sanchez was  not\npresent  when  the  conversations  were  recorded.    Sanchez\ntestified that he actually  taped the two phone conversations\nat issue.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nin  violation  of  21 U.S.C.     843(b)  (Counts  I and  II).\n\nSantos, Torres  and Ayala were all  charged with importation,\n\nincluding aiding and abetting (Count III) and possession with\n\nintent to distribute (Count IV) all in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n   952(a) and 841 (a)(1) and 18 U.S.C.   2.   All pleaded not\n\nguilty.  At trial,  there was a hearing outside  the presence\n\nof the jury to determine the admissibility of the transcripts\n\nof  the  phone conversations.   More  specifically defendants\n\nargued that  the transcripts  should not be  admitted because\n\neach transcript identified defendants by their initials (\"KS\"\n\nfor Santos and \"JM\" for Torres).  The district court admitted\n\nthe  transcripts  with the  initials.    All defendants  were\n\nconvicted  on all  counts, except  that the  third defendant,\n\nAyala,  was  acquitted  of  the  importation  charge.    Each\n\ndefendant raises separate issues.  We address them in turn.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA.  Santos\n          \n\n     1.  The Appearance of Santos' Initials on the Transcript\n                                                             \n\n          Santos argues that the  absence of Miranda warnings\n\nat his  post-arrest detention renders  unconstitutional Agent\n\nSanchez's identification  of his voice as  the voice speaking\n\non the  tape.  Santos goes on to argue that the appearance of\n\nhis initials on the phone transcript, which was  submitted to\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nthe jury, should therefore have been  ruled inadmissible.  We\n\ndisagree.\n\n          As the  Supreme Court has recently  noted, the case\n\nof  Miranda  v.  Arizona,  384  U.S.  436  (1966),  does  not\n                        \n\nestablish  \"an absolute  right  against  being  compelled  to\n\nspeak.\"    Doe v.  United  States, 487  U.S. 201,  214  n. 12\n                                 \n\n(1988).    Rather,  \"that  understanding is  refuted  by  the\n\nCourt's  decision in United  States v.  Dionisio, 410  U.S. 1\n                                                \n\n(1973), in which the Court held that a suspect may not invoke\n\nthe privilege in refusing to speak  for purposes of providing\n\na voice exemplar.\"  Id.   \n                       \n\n          In  short,  these cases  teach  that  the right  to\n\nremain silent does not  include the right to refuse  giving a\n\nvoice  exemplar.   Thus,  even if  Santos  had been  read his\n\nMiranda rights, he had no constitutionally protected interest\n\nin keeping law enforcement  officials from hearing his voice.\n\nWithout a cognizable constitutional interest,  Santos' effort\n\nto suppress the transcript fails.\n\n          Santos'   non-constitutional   challenges  to   the\n\nadmission  of the transcripts are equally fruitless.  We have\n\nfrequently noted that  \"the use of transcripts  to assist the\n\njury  is committed  to  the  sound  discretion of  the  trial\n\njudge.\"   United States v. Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d 42, 48 (1st\n                                       \n\nCir. 1991),  cert. denied, 112 S.  Ct. 954 (1992).   See also\n                                                             \n\nUnited States v. Panzardi-Lespier,  918 F.2d 313, 318-19 (1st\n                                 \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nCir. 1990); United States v. Carbone, 798 F.2d 21, 26-27 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir.  1986); United States v. Rengifo, 789 F.2d 975, 980 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1986).  In this case, the district court listened to the\n\ntapes, interviewed Sanchez, and heard extensive argument from\n\ncounsel, all outside the presence  of the jury, before ruling\n\non the use of  the transcript.  The district  court satisfied\n\nitself as  to Agent  Sanchez's qualifications and  ability to\n\nmake  a voice identification in this case,  as well as to the\n\nauthenticity and  proper chain  of custody  of  the tape  and\n\ntranscripts.  In addition,  the district court properly noted\n\nthat  Santos was  free to  argue to  the jury  that Sanchez's\n\nidentification of the voice on the tape as that of Santos was\n\nunreliable.   Defendant points to no evidence,  in the record\n\nor  otherwise, to  suggest that  any of  these determinations\n\nconstituted an abuse of discretion.  Accordingly, we  find no\n\nabuse  in the district court's  decision to allow  use of the\n\ntranscripts.\n\n2.  Sufficiency of Evidence\n                           \n\n          Santos argues that  there is insufficient  evidence\n\nto  support his  conviction on  Count  III, importation  of a\n\ncontrolled substance.   As  noted above,  for the  purpose of\n\nchallenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, we review  the\n\nevidence in a light most favorable to the government, drawing\n\nall inferences in  favor of  the verdict.   See, e.g.,  Mena-\n                                                             \n\nRobles,  4 F.3d  at  1031.   Moreover,  the evidence  may  be\n      \n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nentirely circumstantial and need not exclude every reasonable\n\nhypothesis of  innocence; that is, the  factfinder may decide\n\namong reasonable interpretations of the evidence.  See United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Torres-Maldonado, 14 F.3d 95, 100 (1st Cir. 1994).\n                          \n\n          When so  viewed, the evidence in  this case clearly\n\nsupports Santos' conviction for  importation.  To begin with,\n\nMarcial gave Santos' number  to the CI in Colombia.   Santos,\n\nwithout more, picked up a phone call late at night, responded\n\nto  code words  about  a  delivery  from  \"Mr.  Estela,\"  and\n\nappeared at the  scene of  delivery requesting  \"the 4  kilos\n\nfrom  Colombia.\"    Thus,  the  evidence  shows  an  intimate\n\nknowledge  of the  importation  scheme and  a willingness  to\n\nparticipate  therein.     In  sum,  we   find  this  evidence\n\nsufficient to support a conviction for importation.\n\n3.  Sentencing\n              \n\n          Santos claims that he  should be sentenced based on\n\none kilogram of cocaine, rather than four, because $3970, the\n\namount  found in  the car,  could not  buy four  kilograms at\n\ncurrent market rates.   (In fact, $3970 will not even buy one\n\nkilogram,  which the district court found to cost $15,000 and\n\nwhich may, in fact, cost considerably more).  \n\n          We begin  by noting that the  facts supporting drug\n\nquantity  determinations  for  sentencing  purposes  must  be\n\nproven by the government by a preponderance of  the evidence.\n\nUnited States v. Legarda,  17 F.3d 496, 499 (1st  Cir. 1994).\n                        \n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nA  district  court's factual  findings on  such an  issue are\n\nreviewed for clear error only.  Id.   We find no error in the\n                                   \n\ndistrict  court's  determination   that  Santos  intended  to\n\npurchase four  kilograms.   Marcial, the seller  in Colombia,\n\ngave  the  CI four  kilograms and  promised  that a  buyer in\n\nPuerto  Rico would  purchase  that amount.   Santos  met that\n\nexpectation, specifically mentioning four kilograms to the CI\n\njust prior to his arrest, and the CI was ushered into Santos'\n\ncar carrying the four kilograms.  As to the low sum of money,\n\nthe record does not  rule out the possibility that  the $3970\n\nwas merely payment to the CI for his role in the importation,\n\nand  that more  money would  be owing  to the  seller through\n\nalternate means.   In  sum, we  find no basis  in the  record\n\nbefore us  for concluding that the  district court's quantity\n\ndetermination was clear error.3  \n\n                    \n\n3.  Santos  also argues that, because  the cash on hand could\nnot purchase four  kilograms of cocaine at  current rates, he\nshould have  been charged with the  \"lesser included offense\"\nof  attempting to  import just  one kilogram  of cocaine.   A\nlesser included  offense is one  which is \"composed  of some,\nbut not all elements of a greater offense and which  does not\nhave  any element  not  included in  [the] greater  offense.\"\nBlack's Law Dictionary, 902  (6th ed. 1990).  For  example, a\n                      \nlesser   included  offense  of   possession  with  intent  to\ndistribute  would be simple possession.   A mere lower amount\nof  drugs, however,  does not  amount to  a \"lesser  included\noffense.\"  \n          In  this  case,  the  district  court,  upon  being\nrequested  to instruct  on a  lesser included  offense, asked\nSantos  if  he  was   requesting  an  instruction  on  simple\npossession.  Santos replied in the negative.  Accordingly, we\ndeem this issue  waived.  Moreover,  we see no  error in  the\ndistrict  court's refusal  to instruct  on a  lesser included\noffense based solely on a lower amount of drugs.\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nB.  Torres\n          \n\n     1.  Sufficiency\n                    \n\n          Torres  also  challenges  the  sufficiency  of  the\n\nevidence supporting his convictions.   Our standard of review\n\nis set out, supra.   Like Santos' challenge, we  find Torres'\n                 \n\nsufficiency challenge unavailing.\n\n          Torres  answered   the  second  phone  call.     He\n\ndisplayed intimate  knowledge  of the  plan to  meet the  CI,\n\nwhich  had been  discussed  in the  earlier  call to  Santos.\n\nTorres' own participation included  an attempt to raise cash.\n\nFinally, Torres  appeared at the purchase  carrying more than\n\n$500 in cash.  Based on these facts, a  reasonable jury could\n\nconclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Torres was guilty  of\n\nboth  aiding  and abetting  the  importation  of cocaine  and\n\npossession with intent to distribute.  \n\n     2.  Sentencing\n                   \n\n          Torres  argues  that  he  is  entitled  to downward\n\ndepartures based on his  acceptance of responsibility and his\n\nminimal  participation.   \"Whether a  defendant  has accepted\n\npersonal responsibility is a `fact-dominated issue.'\"  United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.  Donovan, 996  F.2d  1343,  1346 (1st  Cir.  1993)\n                   \n\n(quoting  United States v. Royer,  895 F.2d 28,  29 (1st Cir.\n                                \n\n1990)).   A downward adjustment for  minimal participation is\n\nsimilarly  fact-dominated and  is  reviewed for  clear  error\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nonly.   See United States  v. Rosado-Sierra, 938  F.2d 1, 1-2\n                                           \n\n(1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          Torres'  presentence report  concluded that  he did\n\nnot   demonstrate  a   genuine  recognition   or  affirmative\n\nacceptance  of  responsibility.    This  characterization  is\n\nbuttressed  by  the fact  that Torres  went  to trial  on the\n\nmerits of his case.  See, e.g., U.S.S.G.   3E1.1, Application\n                              \n\nNote  1(h)  (stating that  sentencing courts  should consider\n\n\"the timeliness  of  defendant's conduct  in manifesting  the\n\nacceptance  of  responsibility.\");  and  Application  Note  2\n                                       \n\n(\"This adjustment is not intended to apply to a defendant who\n\nputs  the government  to  its burden  of  proof at  trial  by\n\ndenying  the   essential  factual   elements  of   guilt,  is\n\nconvicted,  and   only  then   admits  guilt   and  expresses\n\nremorse.\").4   In this case, we find  no error in the court's\n\nfactual determination that Torres did not sufficiently accept\n\nresponsibility  to  warrant  a  downward  departure  in   his\n\nsentence.\n\n          Nor  do we  find  error in  the determination  that\n\nTorres was not  a minimal  participant.  In  the taped  phone\n\nconversation, Torres  revealed an  intimate knowledge  of and\n\ninterest  in the  purchase.    Moreover,  he arrived  at  the\n\npurchase  with over $500  in cash.    Thus, we  find no clear\n\n                    \n\n4.  Even  now,  Torres  argues  that  there  is  insufficient\nevidence  to support  his convictions,  while he  also claims\nthat he has accepted responsibility.\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nerror in the  sentencing court's  determination that  Torres'\n\nparticipation was not minimal.\n\nC.  Ayala\n         \n\n          In essence, Ayala challenges the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence against  him by arguing  that the evidence  shows no\n\nmore  than \"mere presence\" at  the pick-up point  and that he\n\nwas  no  more  than an  observer  at this  drug  crime.   The\n\nrelevant standard of review  is set out, supra.   We conclude\n                                              \n\nthat  Ayala's challenge  to the  sufficiency of  the evidence\n\nmeets the same fate as those of his codefendants. \n\n          As we  have noted  elsewhere,  \"the factfinder  may\n\nfairly  infer . . . that  it runs counter to human experience\n\nto suppose that criminal  conspirators would welcome innocent\n\nnonparticipants as witnesses to their crimes.\"  United States\n                                                             \n\nv.  Batista-Polanco,  927  F.2d   14,  18  (1st  Cir.  1991).\n                   \n\nMoreover,  \"the culpability of  a defendant's presence hinges\n\nupon whether  the  circumstances fairly  imply  participatory\n\ninvolvement.   In other words, a  defendant's `mere presence'\n\nargument  will  fail  in   situations  where  the  `mere'  is\n\nlacking.\"  United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 678 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1993).   Viewed through  this lens, the  record in  this\n\ncase clearly supports Ayala's conviction.\n\n          To begin with, Ayala's phone number was first given\n\nto the CI in January.   Though he was never  directly reached\n\nby phone  on that  trip, Ayala  did show  up at  the February\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\npurchase.    These facts  allow an  inference that  Ayala was\n\ninvolved with this drug scheme from the beginning.  Moreover,\n\nAyala, like his  codefendants, lives in the  Carolina area of\n\nPuerto  Rico,  which is  over an  hour  from Ponce,  where he\n\nappeared early on the morning of the purchase.\n\n          In  addition, Ayala  had a  beeper, a  typical drug\n\ntrade  item, on  his  person when  he  was arrested.    Phone\n\nrecords  show that a call was placed  from Santos' phone to a\n\nbeeper service at 4:30 a.m. on the morning  of the drug deal.\n\nThough there is apparently no record  evidence that Ayala was\n\npaged  that night, Ayala  conceded at oral  argument that the\n\ncall  from Santos' phone went to the very beeper service that\n\nAyala used.  Finally, once at the scene, Ayala opened the car\n\ndoor to  allow the CI to enter the car with four kilograms of\n\ncocaine.    Based  on all  of  this  evidence,  a jury  could\n\nconclude  beyond a reasonable doubt  that Ayala was guilty of\n\naiding  and abetting  possession  with intent  to  distribute\n\ncocaine. \n\n          We have carefully considered  all other aspects  of\n\ndefendants' arguments and find them to be without merit. \n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          For  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  convictions and\n\nsentences of all defendants are\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n",

See United States v.  Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d 1026, 1029 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1550 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Confidential informant Ruben de los Santos (the CI)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> worked on board the merchant vessel Euro-Colombia, a ship which routinely travels between Colombia and Puerto Rico.  In December of 1991, the CI was approached in Cartagena, Colombia, by a Mr. Marcial who asked the CI to smuggle four kilograms of cocaine on the Euro-Colombia from Colombia to Puerto Rico.  Marcial gave the CI the contraband and a phone number to call when the ship reached Puerto Rico.  The phone number was later determined to be a cellular phone number assigned to Ayala.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early January, the ship arrived in Ponce.  The CI called the number and received no answer.  United States Customs agents, with whom the CI was cooperating, photographed the drugs and then allowed the CI to return to Colombia with the contraband.  In Colombia, Marcial asked the CI to try delivering the drugs again and gave the CI a new telephone number to call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February, the ship arrived at Ponce a second time.  At 3:30 in the morning, the CI called the new number.  The resulting conversation was taped by United States Customs officials.  Santos answered the phone.  The CI began by asking if Santos knew \"Mr. Estela,\" and said that he had a \"present\" for Santos.  Santos replied that he knew Mr. Estela.  The word cocaine was not mentioned, but a price of $4000 per kilogram was agreed upon.  A time and place for delivery were set.  Santos said that he would arrive at 5:00 a.m.  in Ponce and that he would be driving a gold Porsche.  He also mentioned that he needed to raise cash for the purchase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second phone call was made to the same number at about 4:00 a.m., which was also taped by customs officials.  This time, the CI spoke with Torres.  The delivery time was moved back to 8:00 a.m.  Torres stated, among other things, that he needed the time to raise money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 8:00 a.m., Santos and Torres showed up at the appointed delivery spot.  They were riding in a Mitsubishi Mirage, not a Porsche.  Ayala, the third defendant, was also with them.  Santos signaled to the CI, who replied by asking what Santos wanted.  Santos replied, \"The 4 kilos from Colombia.\"  The CI asked to be paid.  Ayala opened the car door, Santos told the CI to get into the car, and the CI obliged.  All three defendants were arrested shortly thereafter.  In the car, agents discovered a car phone, with the very phone number that the CI had called, along with $3970 in cash.  Torres was carrying over $500 in cash.  In addition, Santos' key chain had a Porsche emblem on it.  Ayala also had a beeper on his person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All three defendants were held for several hours by customs officials without being read their Miranda warnings.  During those hours, all were questioned.  United States Customs Service Agent Radames Sanchez, who had taped the conversations earlier that morning,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> then listened briefly to the questions being asked defendants in order to identify their voices.  He determined that Santos' voice was the voice he heard on the tape of the first phone call, and that Torres' voice was the one he heard on the tape of the second call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santos and Torres were charged with using a \"communication facility\" in carrying out a drug transaction in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 843(b) (Counts I and II).  Santos, Torres and Ayala were all charged with importation, including aiding and abetting (Count III) and possession with intent to distribute (Count IV) all in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 952(a) and 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2.  All pleaded not guilty.  At trial, there was a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine the admissibility of the transcripts of the phone conversations.  More specifically defendants argued that the transcripts should not be admitted because each transcript identified defendants by their initials (\"KS\" for Santos and \"JM\" for Torres).  The district court admitted the transcripts with the initials.  All defendants were convicted on all counts, except that the third defendant, Ayala, was acquitted of the importation charge.  Each defendant raises separate issues.  We address them in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Santos</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Appearance of Santos' Initials on the Transcript</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santos argues that the absence of Miranda warnings at his post-arrest detention renders unconstitutional Agent Sanchez's identification of his voice as the voice speaking on the tape.  Santos goes on to argue that the appearance of his initials on the phone transcript, which was submitted to the jury, should therefore have been ruled inadmissible.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Supreme Court has recently noted, the case of  Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), does not establish \"an absolute right against being compelled to speak.\"  Doe v. United States, 487 U.S. 201, 214 n. 12 (1988).  Rather, \"that understanding is refuted by the Court's decision in  United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1 (1973), in which the Court held that a suspect may not invoke the privilege in refusing to speak for purposes of providing a voice exemplar.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, these cases teach that the right to remain silent does not include the right to refuse giving a voice exemplar.  Thus, even if Santos had been read his Miranda rights, he had no constitutionally protected interest in keeping law enforcement officials from hearing his voice.  Without a cognizable constitutional interest, Santos' effort to suppress the transcript fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santos' non-constitutional challenges to the admission of the transcripts are equally fruitless.  We have frequently noted that \"the use of transcripts to assist the jury is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\"   United States v. Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d 42, 48 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 954 (1992).  See also United States v.  Panzardi-Lespier, 918 F.2d 313, 318-19 (1st Cir. 1990);   United States v. Carbone, 798 F.2d 21, 26-27 (1st Cir. 1986);   United States v. Rengifo, 789 F.2d 975, 980 (1st Cir. 1986).  In this case, the district court listened to the tapes, interviewed Sanchez, and heard extensive argument from counsel, all outside the presence of the jury, before ruling on the use of the transcript.  The district court satisfied itself as to Agent Sanchez's qualifications and ability to make a voice identification in this case, as well as to the authenticity and proper chain of custody of the tape and transcripts.  In addition, the district court properly noted that Santos was free to argue to the jury that Sanchez's identification of the voice on the tape as that of Santos was unreliable.  Defendant points to no evidence, in the record or otherwise, to suggest that any of these determinations constituted an abuse of discretion.  Accordingly, we find no abuse in the district court's decision to allow use of the transcripts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santos argues that there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction on Count III, importation of a controlled substance.  As noted above, for the purpose of challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, we review the evidence in a light most favorable to the government, drawing all inferences in favor of the verdict.   See, e.g., Mena- Robles, 4 F.3d at 1031.  Moreover, the evidence may be entirely circumstantial and need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence;  that is, the factfinder may decide among reasonable interpretations of the evidence.  See United States v.  Torres-Maldonado, 14 F.3d 95, 100 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When so viewed, the evidence in this case clearly supports Santos' conviction for importation.  To begin with, Marcial gave Santos' number to the CI in Colombia.  Santos, without more, picked up a phone call late at night, responded to code words about a delivery from \"Mr. Estela,\" and appeared at the scene of delivery requesting \"the 4 kilos from Colombia.\"  Thus, the evidence shows an intimate knowledge of the importation scheme and a willingness to participate therein.  In sum, we find this evidence sufficient to support a conviction for importation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santos claims that he should be sentenced based on one kilogram of cocaine, rather than four, because $3970, the amount found in the car, could not buy four kilograms at current market rates.  (In fact, $3970 will not even buy one kilogram, which the district court found to cost $15,000 and which may, in fact, cost considerably more).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that the facts supporting drug quantity determinations for sentencing purposes must be proven by the government by a preponderance of the evidence.   United States v. Legarda, 17 F.3d 496, 499 (1st Cir. 1994).  A district court's factual findings on such an issue are reviewed for clear error only.  Id. We find no error in the district court's determination that Santos intended to purchase four kilograms.  Marcial, the seller in Colombia, gave the CI four kilograms and promised that a buyer in Puerto Rico would purchase that amount.  Santos met that expectation, specifically mentioning four kilograms to the CI just prior to his arrest, and the CI was ushered into Santos' car carrying the four kilograms.  As to the low sum of money, the record does not rule out the possibility that the $3970 was merely payment to the CI for his role in the importation, and that more money would be owing to the seller through alternate means.  In sum, we find no basis in the record before us for concluding that the district court's quantity determination was clear error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Torres</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Sufficiency</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions.  Our standard of review is set out, supra.  Like Santos' challenge, we find Torres' sufficiency challenge unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres answered the second phone call.  He displayed intimate knowledge of the plan to meet the CI, which had been discussed in the earlier call to Santos.  Torres' own participation included an attempt to raise cash.  Finally, Torres appeared at the purchase carrying more than $500 in cash.  Based on these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Torres was guilty of both aiding and abetting the importation of cocaine and possession with intent to distribute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres argues that he is entitled to downward departures based on his acceptance of responsibility and his minimal participation.  \"Whether a defendant has accepted personal responsibility is a 'fact-dominated issue.' \"   United States v. Donovan, 996 F.2d 1343, 1346 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting  United States v. Royer, 895 F.2d 28, 29 (1st Cir. 1990)).  A downward adjustment for minimal participation is similarly fact-dominated and is reviewed for clear error only.   See United States v. Rosado-Sierra, 938 F.2d 1, 1-2 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres' presentence report concluded that he did not demonstrate a genuine recognition or affirmative acceptance of responsibility.  This characterization is buttressed by the fact that Torres went to trial on the merits of his case.  See, e.g., U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1, Application Note 1(h) (stating that sentencing courts should consider \"the timeliness of defendant's conduct in manifesting the acceptance of responsibility.\");  and Application Note 2 (\"This adjustment is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  In this case, we find no error in the court's factual determination that Torres did not sufficiently accept responsibility to warrant a downward departure in his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we find error in the determination that Torres was not a minimal participant.  In the taped phone conversation, Torres revealed an intimate knowledge of and interest in the purchase.  Moreover, he arrived at the purchase with over $500 in cash.  Thus, we find no clear error in the sentencing court's determination that Torres' participation was not minimal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Ayala</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, Ayala challenges the sufficiency of the evidence against him by arguing that the evidence shows no more than \"mere presence\" at the pick-up point and that he was no more than an observer at this drug crime.  The relevant standard of review is set out, supra.  We conclude that Ayala's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence meets the same fate as those of his codefendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have noted elsewhere, \"the factfinder may fairly infer ... that it runs counter to human experience to suppose that criminal conspirators would welcome innocent nonparticipants as witnesses to their crimes.\"  United States v.  Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 1991).  Moreover, \"the culpability of a defendant's presence hinges upon whether the circumstances fairly imply participatory involvement.  In other words, a defendant's 'mere presence' argument will fail in situations where the 'mere' is lacking.\"  United States v.  Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 678 (1st Cir. 1993).  Viewed through this lens, the record in this case clearly supports Ayala's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin with, Ayala's phone number was first given to the CI in January.  Though he was never directly reached by phone on that trip, Ayala did show up at the February purchase.  These facts allow an inference that Ayala was involved with this drug scheme from the beginning.  Moreover, Ayala, like his codefendants, lives in the Carolina area of Puerto Rico, which is over an hour from Ponce, where he appeared early on the morning of the purchase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Ayala had a beeper, a typical drug trade item, on his person when he was arrested.  Phone records show that a call was placed from Santos' phone to a beeper service at 4:30 a.m.  on the morning of the drug deal.  Though there is apparently no record evidence that Ayala was paged that night, Ayala conceded at oral argument that the call from Santos' phone went to the very beeper service that Ayala used.  Finally, once at the scene, Ayala opened the car door to allow the CI to enter the car with four kilograms of cocaine.  Based on all of this evidence, a jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Ayala was guilty of aiding and abetting possession with intent to distribute cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have carefully considered all other aspects of defendants' arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the convictions and sentences of all defendants are</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>*Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The CI is no relation to defendant Kim de los Santos</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Santos argues in his brief that Agent Sanchez was not present when the conversations were recorded.

A lesser included offense is one which is \"composed of some, but not all elements of a greater offense and which does not have any element not included in [the] greater offense.\"  Black's Law Dictionary, 902 (6th ed. 1990).  For example, a lesser included offense of possession with intent to distribute would be simple possession.  A mere lower amount of drugs, however, does not amount to a \"lesser included offense.\"</p>\n        <p>In this case, the district court, upon being requested to instruct on a lesser included offense, asked Santos if he was requesting an instruction on simple possession.  Santos replied in the negative.  Accordingly, we deem this issue waived.  Moreover, we see no error in the district court's refusal to instruct on a lesser included offense based solely on a lower amount of drugs.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Even now, Torres argues that there is insufficient evidence to support his convictions, while he also claims that he has accepted responsibility</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

See United States v.  Mena-Robles, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194956\"><a href=\"/opinion/194956/united-states-v-mena-robles/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1026</span></a></span>, 1029 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In December of 1991, the CI was approached in Cartagena, Colombia, by a Mr. Marcial who asked the CI to smuggle four kilograms of cocaine on the Euro-Colombia from Colombia to Puerto Rico.  Marcial gave the CI the contraband and a phone number to call when the ship reached Puerto Rico.  The phone number was later determined to be a cellular phone number assigned to Ayala.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early January, the ship arrived in Ponce.  The CI called the number and received no answer.  United States Customs agents, with whom the CI was cooperating, photographed the drugs and then allowed the CI to return to Colombia with the contraband.  In Colombia, Marcial asked the CI to try delivering the drugs again and gave the CI a new telephone number to call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February, the ship arrived at Ponce a second time.  At 3:30 in the morning, the CI called the new number.  The resulting conversation was taped by United States Customs officials.  Santos answered the phone.  The CI began by asking if Santos knew \"Mr. Estela,\" and said that he had a \"present\" for Santos.  Santos replied that he knew Mr. Estela.  The word cocaine was not mentioned, but a price of $4000 per kilogram was agreed upon.  A time and place for delivery were set.  Santos said that he would arrive at 5:00 a.m.  in Ponce and that he would be driving a gold Porsche.  He also mentioned that he needed to raise cash for the purchase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second phone call was made to the same number at about 4:00 a.m., which was also taped by customs officials.  This time, the CI spoke with Torres.  The delivery time was moved back to 8:00 a.m.  Torres stated, among other things, that he needed the time to raise money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 8:00 a.m., Santos and Torres showed up at the appointed delivery spot.  They were riding in a Mitsubishi Mirage, not a Porsche.  Ayala, the third defendant, was also with them.  Santos signaled to the CI, who replied by asking what Santos wanted.  Santos replied, \"The 4 kilos from Colombia.\"  The CI asked to be paid.  Ayala opened the car door, Santos told the CI to get into the car, and the CI obliged.  All three defendants were arrested shortly thereafter.  In the car, agents discovered a car phone, with the very phone number that the CI had called, along with $3970 in cash.  Torres was carrying over $500 in cash.  In addition, Santos' key chain had a Porsche emblem on it.  Ayala also had a beeper on his person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All three defendants were held for several hours by customs officials without being read their Miranda warnings.  During those hours, all were questioned.  United States Customs Service Agent Radames Sanchez, who had taped the conversations earlier that morning,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> then listened briefly to the questions being asked defendants in order to identify their voices.  He determined that Santos' voice was the voice he heard on the tape of the first phone call, and that Torres' voice was the one he heard on the tape of the second call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santos and Torres were charged with using a \"communication facility\" in carrying out a drug transaction in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 843(b) (Counts I and II).  Santos, Torres and Ayala were all charged with importation, including aiding and abetting (Count III) and possession with intent to distribute (Count IV) all in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 952(a) and 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2.  All pleaded not guilty.  At trial, there was a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine the admissibility of the transcripts of the phone conversations.  More specifically defendants argued that the transcripts should not be admitted because each transcript identified defendants by their initials (\"KS\" for Santos and \"JM\" for Torres).  The district court admitted the transcripts with the initials.  All defendants were convicted on all counts, except that the third defendant, Ayala, was acquitted of the importation charge.  Each defendant raises separate issues.  We address them in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Santos</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Appearance of Santos' Initials on the Transcript</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santos argues that the absence of Miranda warnings at his post-arrest detention renders unconstitutional Agent Sanchez's identification of his voice as the voice speaking on the tape.  Santos goes on to argue that the appearance of his initials on the phone transcript, which was submitted to the jury, should therefore have been ruled inadmissible.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Supreme Court has recently noted, the case of  Miranda v. Arizona, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span> </a></span>(1966), does not establish \"an absolute right against being compelled to speak.\"  Doe v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112123\"><a href=\"/opinion/112123/doe-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span>, 214 n. 12 (1988).  Rather, \"that understanding is refuted by the Court's decision in  United States v. Dionisio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108709\"><a href=\"/opinion/108709/united-states-v-dionisio/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span> </a></span>(1973), in which the Court held that a suspect may not invoke the privilege in refusing to speak for purposes of providing a voice exemplar.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, these cases teach that the right to remain silent does not include the right to refuse giving a voice exemplar.  Thus, even if Santos had been read his Miranda rights, he had no constitutionally protected interest in keeping law enforcement officials from hearing his voice.  Without a cognizable constitutional interest, Santos' effort to suppress the transcript fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santos' non-constitutional challenges to the admission of the transcripts are equally fruitless.  We have frequently noted that \"the use of transcripts to assist the jury is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\"   United States v. Font-Ramirez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567923\"><a href=\"/opinion/567923/united-states-v-octavio-font-ramirez/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span> </span>(1992).  See also United States v.  Panzardi-Lespier, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></span>, 318-19 (1st Cir. 1990);   United States v. Carbone, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474549\"><a href=\"/opinion/474549/united-states-v-luis-carbone-aka-luiggi/\"><span class=\"volume\">798</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 26-27 (1st Cir. 1986);   United States v.

In this case, the district court listened to the tapes, interviewed Sanchez, and heard extensive argument from counsel, all outside the presence of the jury, before ruling on the use of the transcript.  The district court satisfied itself as to Agent Sanchez's qualifications and ability to make a voice identification in this case, as well as to the authenticity and proper chain of custody of the tape and transcripts.  In addition, the district court properly noted that Santos was free to argue to the jury that Sanchez's identification of the voice on the tape as that of Santos was unreliable.  Defendant points to no evidence, in the record or otherwise, to suggest that any of these determinations constituted an abuse of discretion.  Accordingly, we find no abuse in the district court's decision to allow use of the transcripts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santos argues that there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction on Count III, importation of a controlled substance.  As noted above, for the purpose of challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, we review the evidence in a light most favorable to the government, drawing all inferences in favor of the verdict.   See, e.g., Mena- <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194956\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Robles,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/194956/united-states-v-mena-robles/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1031</span></a></span>.  Moreover, the evidence may be entirely circumstantial and need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence;  that is, the factfinder may decide among reasonable interpretations of the evidence.  See United States v.  Torres-Maldonado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195153\"><a href=\"/opinion/195153/united-states-v-torres-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span>, 100 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When so viewed, the evidence in this case clearly supports Santos' conviction for importation.  To begin with, Marcial gave Santos' number to the CI in Colombia.  Santos, without more, picked up a phone call late at night, responded to code words about a delivery from \"Mr. Estela,\" and appeared at the scene of delivery requesting \"the 4 kilos from Colombia.\"  Thus, the evidence shows an intimate knowledge of the importation scheme and a willingness to participate therein.  In sum, we find this evidence sufficient to support a conviction for importation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santos claims that he should be sentenced based on one kilogram of cocaine, rather than four, because $3970, the amount found in the car, could not buy four kilograms at current market rates.  (In fact, $3970 will not even buy one kilogram, which the district court found to cost $15,000 and which may, in fact, cost considerably more).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that the facts supporting drug quantity determinations for sentencing purposes must be proven by the government by a preponderance of the evidence.   United States v. Legarda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195229\"><a href=\"/opinion/195229/united-states-v-legarda/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span>, 499 (1st Cir. 1994).  A district court's factual findings on such an issue are reviewed for clear error only.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195229\"><a href=\"/opinion/195229/united-states-v-legarda/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> We find </a></span>no error in the district court's determination that Santos intended to purchase four kilograms.  Marcial, the seller in Colombia, gave the CI four kilograms and promised that a buyer in Puerto Rico would purchase that amount.  Santos met that expectation, specifically mentioning four kilograms to the CI just prior to his arrest, and the CI was ushered into Santos' car carrying the four kilograms.  As to the low sum of money, the record does not rule out the possibility that the $3970 was merely payment to the CI for his role in the importation, and that more money would be owing to the seller through alternate means.  In sum, we find no basis in the record before us for concluding that the district court's quantity determination was clear error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Torres</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Sufficiency</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions.  Our standard of review is set <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">out,</span> supra</span>.  Like Santos' challenge, we find Torres' sufficiency challenge unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres answered the second phone call.  He displayed intimate knowledge of the plan to meet the CI, which had been discussed in the earlier call to Santos.  Torres' own participation included an attempt to raise cash.  Finally, Torres appeared at the purchase carrying more than $500 in cash.  Based on these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Torres was guilty of both aiding and abetting the importation of cocaine and possession with intent to distribute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres argues that he is entitled to downward departures based on his acceptance of responsibility and his minimal participation.  \"Whether a defendant has accepted personal responsibility is a 'fact-dominated issue.' \"   United States v. Donovan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610557\"><a href=\"/opinion/610557/united-states-v-richard-j-donovan/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1343</span></a></span>, 1346 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting  United States v.

A downward adjustment for minimal participation is similarly fact-dominated and is reviewed for clear error only.   See United States v. Rosado-Sierra, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564415\"><a href=\"/opinion/564415/united-states-v-jorge-l-rosado-sierra/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 1-2 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres' presentence report concluded that he did not demonstrate a genuine recognition or affirmative acceptance of responsibility.  This characterization is buttressed by the fact that Torres went to trial on the merits of his case.  See, e.g., U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1, Application Note 1(h) (stating that sentencing courts should consider \"the timeliness of defendant's conduct in manifesting the acceptance of responsibility.\");  and Application Note 2 (\"This adjustment is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  In this case, we find no error in the court's factual determination that Torres did not sufficiently accept responsibility to warrant a downward departure in his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we find error in the determination that Torres was not a minimal participant.  In the taped phone conversation, Torres revealed an intimate knowledge of and interest in the purchase.  Moreover, he arrived at the purchase with over $500 in cash.  Thus, we find no clear error in the sentencing court's determination that Torres' participation was not minimal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Ayala</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, Ayala challenges the sufficiency of the evidence against him by arguing that the evidence shows no more than \"mere presence\" at the pick-up point and that he was no more than an observer at this drug crime.  The relevant standard of review is set <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">out,</span> supra</span>.  We conclude that Ayala's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence meets the same fate as those of his codefendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have noted elsewhere, \"the factfinder may fairly infer ... that it runs counter to human experience to suppose that criminal conspirators would welcome innocent nonparticipants as witnesses to their crimes.\"  United States v.

Moreover, \"the culpability of a defendant's presence hinges upon whether the circumstances fairly imply participatory involvement.  In other words, a defendant's 'mere presence' argument will fail in situations where the 'mere' is lacking.\"  United States v.  Echeverri, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597415\"><a href=\"/opinion/597415/united-states-v-marco-a-echeverri/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span>, 678 (1st Cir. 1993).  Viewed through this lens, the record in this case clearly supports Ayala's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin with, Ayala's phone number was first given to the CI in January.  Though he was never directly reached by phone on that trip, Ayala did show up at the February purchase.  These facts allow an inference that Ayala was involved with this drug scheme from the beginning.  Moreover, Ayala, like his codefendants, lives in the Carolina area of Puerto Rico, which is over an hour from Ponce, where he appeared early on the morning of the purchase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Ayala had a beeper, a typical drug trade item, on his person when he was arrested.  Phone records show that a call was placed from Santos' phone to a beeper service at 4:30 a.m.  on the morning of the drug deal.  Though there is apparently no record evidence that Ayala was paged that night, Ayala conceded at oral argument that the call from Santos' phone went to the very beeper service that Ayala used.  Finally, once at the scene, Ayala opened the car door to allow the CI to enter the car with four kilograms of cocaine.  Based on all of this evidence, a jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Ayala was guilty of aiding and abetting possession with intent to distribute cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have carefully considered all other aspects of defendants' arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the convictions and sentences of all defendants are</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>*Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The CI is no relation to defendant Kim de los Santos</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Santos argues in his brief that Agent Sanchez was not present when the conversations were recorded.  Sanchez testified that he actually taped the two phone conversations at issue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Santos also argues that, because the cash on hand could not purchase four kilograms of cocaine at current rates, he should have been charged with the \"lesser included offense\" of attempting to import just one kilogram of cocaine.  A lesser included offense is one which is \"composed of some, but not all elements of a greater offense and which does not have any element not included in [the] greater offense.\"  Black's Law Dictionary, 902 (6th ed. 1990).  For example, a lesser included offense of possession with intent to distribute would be simple possession.  A mere lower amount of drugs, however, does not amount to a \"lesser included offense.\"</p>\n        <p>In this case, the district court, upon being requested to instruct on a lesser included offense, asked Santos if he was requesting an instruction on simple possession.  Santos replied in the negative.  Accordingly, we deem this issue waived.  Moreover, we see no error in the district court's refusal to instruct on a lesser included offense based solely on a lower amount of drugs.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Even now, Torres argues that there is insufficient evidence to support his convictions, while he also claims that he has accepted responsibility</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
