Claimant Frank  Goldman appeals pro se from\r                           \r\n\nthe district  court's grant of  summary judgment in  favor of\r\n\nthe United States  in this civil  forfeiture action under  21\r\n\nU.S.C.    881(a)(6).   Goldman  was previously  convicted  of\r\n\ntrafficking offenses in connection with his attempted sale of\r\n\ncocaine  to a government undercover agent.  The facts and the\r\n\nextensive evidence  against  Goldman are  summarized  in  our\r\n\ndecision affirming his conviction.  United States v. Goldman,\r                                                                        \r\n\n41 F.3d  785 (1st Cir. 1994),  cert. denied, 115 S.  Ct. 1321\r                                                       \r\n\n(1995).\r\n\n     In  connection with  Goldman's  arrest, law  enforcement\r\n\nofficers  at the scene seized  $722 from Goldman's person and\r\n\n$5,400 from  the trunk of Goldman's car.   Most of the seized\r\n\ncurrency was in  small denominations and  the currency  taken\r\n\nfrom the  car was in an  open gym bag underneath  a paper bag\r\n\ncontaining two kilograms of cocaine.  While the criminal case\r\n\nwas pending,  the government filed a  civil forfeiture action\r\n\nagainst the seized currency under 21 U.S.C.   881(a)(6).  \r\n\n     Ultimately, Goldman filed a motion for summary judgment;\r\n\nin  an accompanying affidavit, he asserted  that the money in\r\n\nthe gym bag was  the remainder of a $12,000  inheritance from\r\n\nhis father that Goldman  had been planning to deposit  in the\r\n\nbank.   The  government  cross-moved  for  summary  judgment,\r\n\nsupported  by  transcripts  of  the  testimony  in  Goldman's\r\n\ncriminal trial.  The district court granted the  government's\r\n\nmotion, and this appeal followed.\r\r\n\n     We  need  not  resolve  Goldman's  argument  that  civil\r\n\nforfeiture for  the same conduct previously  made the subject\r\n\nof a  criminal conviction  would violate the  double jeopardy\r\n\nclause of  the Fifth  Amendment.   Compare  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\n$405,089.23 U.S.  Currency, 33  F.3d 1210, 1216-22  (9th Cir.\r                                      \r\n\n1994),  amended 56  F.3d  41 (1995),  with  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nTilley, 18 F.3d 295, 297-300 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nCt. 573 (1994).   There is no indication that the currency in\r\n\nquestion derived  from any transaction for  which Goldman was\r\n\nconvicted  or was linked to  any prior conviction.   Thus, no\r\n\ndouble jeopardy question is presented.    \r\n\n     The  government had  a relatively  light burden  to show\r\n\nprobable   cause  to   believe   the   seized  currency   was\r\n\nforfeitable,  see United States v. 255 Broadway, 9 F.3d 1000,\r                                                           \r\n\n1003  (1st Cir. 1993), and the  facts already described amply\r\n\nmet that burden.   The obligation then shifted to  Goldman to\r\n\nprovide specific facts showing that there was a genuine issue\r\n\nof  material fact for trial.  See Fed.  R. Civ. P. 56(e).  In\r                                             \r\n\nour view,  the notion that Goldman's  alleged inheritance was\r\n\nbeing  carried around  in  small bills  in  an open  gym  bag\r\n\nunderneath cocaine  in the trunk  of his car  is sufficiently\r\n\nfanciful that no trial was required.  Affirmed.\r                                                          \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n",
