The fee application  was\n\npredicated  on the theory  that the  lawsuit BTZ  brought against\n\nGreat  Northern  in  the United  States  District  Court  for the\n\nDistrict  of  Maine  caused Great  Northern  to  capitulate to  a\n\nhostile  takeover by  Georgia Pacific  Corporation (\"GPC\")  which\n\nresulted in  substantial benefit  to other Great  Northern share-\n\nholders.

The Board of Directors of Great Northern\n\n(\"Board\")  balked.  GPC commenced suit  in Maine federal district\n\ncourt,  seeking a  judicial  declaration that  the Board's  anti-\n\ntakeover  defenses violated state and federal law, as well as the\n\nBoard's fiduciary  duty to Great Northern  shareholders.

The  class\n\naction suits were consolidated and  the State of Maine intervened\n\nto  defend  its anti-takeover  statute from  constitutional chal-\n\nlenge.\n\n          The Board concurrently opened  a second line of defense\n\nby  instituting an  antitrust action  against GPC  in Connecticut\n\nfederal  district court.  Plaintiffs' counsel took no part in the\r                                                                    \n\nConnecticut  action.   On February  12,  1990, GPC  announced its\n\ndivestiture of  all paper  company holdings,  thereby effectively\n\nmooting  the Board's antitrust action.  One week later, the Board\r                                                                \n\ncapitulated and accepted  GPC's tender offer.

Rather,  their legal  services\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nmerely mimicked GPC's  legal efforts in  the Maine lawsuits,  and\n\nplayed no role  whatever in the truly  decisive takeover skirmish\r                        \n\n    the Connecticut  antitrust litigation.

The American Rule\r          A.  The American Rule\r                               \n\n          Under the  American Rule,  absent a specific  statutory\n\nauthorization or contractual agreement to the contrary, litigants\n\nare responsible for their own  attorney fees. See In re  San Juan\r                                                                           \n\nDupont  Plaza  Hotel Fire  Litig., 982  F.2d  603, 606  (1st Cir.\r                                           \n\n1992).  One notable exception to the American Rule obtains in so-\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     2The  State of Maine, as amicus curiae, suggests that we may\nlack appellate jurisdiction because the \"clear sailing\" agreement\nobligates  GPC-Great  Northern, not  BTZ,  to pay  fees  to BTZ's\r                                        \nattorneys.  Thus, it says, BTZ    the only appellant named in the\r                                                    \nnotice of appeal    lacks either standing to appeal from a denial\nof the fee  application, see United States v. AVX,  962 F.2d 108,\r                                                           \n112-13 (1st Cir. 1993), or a demonstrable stake in the outcome of\nthe appeal.\n     Although   dismissal  on  jurisdictional  grounds  might  be\nwarranted, the matter is  not without difficulty and there  is no\ncircuit precedent directly  in point.  BTZ signed  no enforceable\nfee agreement with  its attorneys, but the \"clear sailing\" agree-\nment, qua contract, might arguably  afford BTZ a status analogous\r                   \nto  a \"prevailing party\" in  a statutory fee-shifting  case.  Cf.\r                                                                           \nPontarelli v. Stone,  978 F.2d  773, 775 (1st  Cir. 1992)  (since\r                             \nstatute  specifically  authorizes  fees  to  \"prevailing  party,\"\nprevailing party's attorney has no independent standing to appeal\r                                     \nfrom grant or denial  of fee award); Benitez  v. Collazo-Collazo,\r                                                                          \n888 F.2d 930,  933 (1st Cir.  1989) (same).  We  therefore bypass\nthe  jurisdictional issue and turn to the merits. See FDIC v. Bay\r                                                                           \nStreet Dev.

In these common  benefit cases, a  court\n\nmay  invoke its  equitable jurisdiction  to assess  attorney fees\n\nagainst  beneficiaries  of the  legal  services;  and, where  the\n\nbeneficiaries are corporate shareholders, their assessment may be\n\nimposed upon the corporate  defendant.  See, e.g., Reiser  v. Del\r                                                                           \n\nMonte  Properties Co.,  605 F.2d  1135, 1137-38  (9th Cir.  1979)\r                               \n\n(citing cases).\n\n          BTZ insists that its legal services fit squarely within\n\nthe \"common  benefit\" exception to  the American Rule,  since the\n\nGPC  takeover  enhanced  the  pecuniary interests  of  all  Great\n\nNorthern  shareholders.   The threshold  question, of  course, is\n\nwhether the  BTZ lawsuit in Maine federal district court actually\n\ncaused  the  Board to  capitulate  to the  GPC  takeover, thereby\r                \n\ncontributing  substantially  to the  per-share price  increase in\n\nGreat Northern shares.

The fee application was predicated on the theory that the lawsuit BTZ brought against Great Northern in the United States District Court for the District of Maine caused Great Northern to capitulate to a hostile takeover by Georgia Pacific Corporation (\"GPC\") which resulted in substantial benefit to other Great Northern shareholders.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1989, GPC made an unsolicited tender to acquire Great Northern.  The Board of Directors of Great Northern (\"Board\") balked.  GPC commenced suit in Maine federal district court, seeking a judicial declaration that the Board's antitakeover defenses violated state and federal law, as well as the Board's fiduciary duty to Great Northern shareholders.  Several Great Northern shareholders [hereinafter:  \"plaintiffs\"], including appellant BTZ, brought derivative \"class action\" suits against the Board in Maine federal district court.  The class action suits were consolidated and the State of Maine intervened to defend its antitakeover statute from constitutional challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board concurrently opened a second line of defense by instituting an antitrust action against GPC in Connecticut federal district court.  Plaintiffs' counsel took no part in the Connecticut action.  On February 12, 1990, GPC announced its divestiture of all paper company holdings, thereby effectively mooting the Board's antitrust action.  One week later, the Board capitulated and accepted GPC's tender offer.  See Weinberger v. Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., 925 F.2d 518, 521 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concerned that the plaintiffs in the Maine anti-takeover suits might impede the GPC-Great Northern settlement and merger, GPC entered into a \"clear sailing\" agreement with plaintiffs:  plaintiffs would dismiss their federal actions in Maine and \"take no steps to attach any part of the funds to be paid to [Great Northern] shareholders pursuant to the upcoming tender offer\";  GPC-Great Northern, in turn, would \"pay the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and expenses [up to $2 million,] as shall be awarded by the United States District Court for the District of Maine.\"  Id. at 518 n. 1, 521.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal district court in Maine ultimately denied plaintiffs' fee applications, however, ruling that their attorneys' services were not a significant precipitating \"cause\" of the GPC-Great Northern merger.  Rather, their legal services merely mimicked GPC's legal efforts in the Maine lawsuits, and played no role whatever in the truly decisive takeover skirmish--the Connecticut antitrust litigation.

The American Rule</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the American Rule, absent a specific statutory authorization or contractual agreement to the contrary, litigants are responsible for their own attorney fees.  See In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 982 F.2d 603, 606 (1st Cir.1992).  One notable exception to the American Rule obtains in so-called \"common benefit\" cases, where a plaintiff's suit is prematurely mooted but nonetheless results in a \"substantial [pecuniary or nonpecuniary] benefit\" to a larger class [hereinafter:  \"beneficiaries\"].  In these common benefit cases, a court may invoke its equitable jurisdiction to assess attorney fees against beneficiaries of the legal services;  and, where the beneficiaries are corporate shareholders, their assessment may be imposed upon the corporate defendant.  See, e.g., Reiser v. Del Monte Properties Co., 605 F.2d 1135, 1137-38 (9th Cir.1979) (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BTZ insists that its legal services fit squarely within the \"common benefit\" exception to the American Rule, since the GPC takeover enhanced the pecuniary interests of all Great Northern shareholders.  The threshold question, of course, is whether the BTZ lawsuit in Maine federal district court actually caused the Board to capitulate to the GPC takeover, thereby contributing substantially to the per-share price increase in Great Northern shares.  The district court rejected BTZ's claim on two fronts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Causation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the court found insufficient evidence that BTZ's legal services caused the Board to capitulate to the GPC takeover.  As we have noted, \"causation questions are grist for the factfinder's mill ...,\" Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir.1992) (citing Peckham v. Continental Cas. Ins. Co., 895 F.2d 830, 837 (1st Cir.1990)), which we review under the \"clear error\" standard, see ICC v. Holmes Transp., Inc., 983 F.2d 1122, 1129 (1st Cir.1993) (noting that \"clear error\" leaves reviewing court with the \"definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\").  Cf. Lipsett v. Blanco, 975 F.2d 934, 937, 941 (1st Cir.1992) (according deference to trial court's \"front row seat\" determination as to whether legal services contributed to favorable outcome in underlying litigation) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court finding that the efforts of BTZ's counsel were neither a substantial nor a material factor in GPC's \"decision to increase its bid or in Great Northern's decision to auction itself,\" Weinberger, 801 F.Supp. at 809, is amply supported by the record.  The withdrawal of the Connecticut antitrust action and the defeat of Great Northern's anti-takeover mechanisms in the Maine litigation were the decisive factors contributing to the GPC takeover.  See id. at 811 &amp; n. 11.   BTZ's counsel took no part in the pivotal Connecticut litigation.  Id. at 809.   And to the limited extent that BTZ's counsel participated in the Maine litigation, they did little more than track GPC's filings and audit depositions conducted by GPC.  Id. at 808-11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's robust skepticism of the benefits contributed by BTZ's counsel is especially appropriate given the increasing concerns that redundant or peripheral legal services may parasitize the litigation efforts of lead counsel, yet command a substantial fee.  Insofar as lead counsel reasonably perceive a consequent dilution of the limited resources available for legal services, allowances for phantom legal services frustrate the adversary process and undermine the congressional policy favoring private enforcement of the securities laws.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.

The fee application was predicated on the theory that the lawsuit BTZ brought against Great Northern in the United States District Court for the District of Maine caused Great Northern to capitulate to a hostile takeover by Georgia Pacific Corporation (\"GPC\") which resulted in substantial benefit to other Great Northern shareholders.

The Board of Directors of Great Northern (\"Board\") balked.  GPC commenced suit in Maine federal district court, seeking a judicial declaration that the Board's antitakeover defenses violated state and federal law, as well as the Board's fiduciary duty to Great Northern shareholders.  Several Great Northern shareholders [hereinafter:  \"plaintiffs\"], including appellant BTZ, brought derivative \"class action\" suits against the Board in Maine federal district court.  The class action suits were consolidated and the State of Maine intervened to defend its antitakeover statute from constitutional challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board concurrently opened a second line of defense by instituting an antitrust action against GPC in Connecticut federal district court.  Plaintiffs' counsel took no part in the Connecticut action.  On February 12, 1990, GPC announced its divestiture of all paper company holdings, thereby effectively mooting the Board's antitrust action.  One week later, the Board capitulated and accepted GPC's tender offer.  See Weinberger v.

In these common benefit cases, a court may invoke its equitable jurisdiction to assess attorney fees against beneficiaries of the legal services;  and, where the beneficiaries are corporate shareholders, their assessment may be imposed upon the corporate defendant.

None was better positioned than BTZ to establish what caused Great Northern to succumb to the GPC takeover bid.  First, following its merger with GPC, Great Northern no longer existed as an independent legal entity.  Second, immobilized as a fee opponent by the terms of the \"clear sailing agreement,\" GPC could not attempt to rebut a presumption of substantial benefit without breaching its agreement.  Nor, finally, has there been any showing that the State of Maine, intervenor below and amicus on appeal--even assuming it were able and inclined to oppose the BTZ fee application on policy grounds--was better situated than BTZ to establish causation.  There simply is nothing in the record to suggest that the State of Maine, aligned by happenstance with Great Northern below, was privy to its inner workings or litigation strategy during the decisive stages of the takeover battle.
