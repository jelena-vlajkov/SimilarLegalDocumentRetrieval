Appellant John Yates  appeals the granting\n               \n\nof  judgment as a matter  of law to  appellee Officer Michael\n\nGawel of  the Foster Police Department  on appellant's claims\n\nof   civil  rights  violations,  due  to  appellee's  alleged\n\nmalicious  prosecution  and  false arrest  of  appellant, and\n\nappellant's  state law  claim of  malicious prosecution.   We\n\naffirm.\n\n     Judgment as  a  matter of  law was  properly granted  on\n\nappellant's claim for malicious prosecution under 42 U.S.C.  \n\n1983  because appellant failed to show that he had suffered a\n\ndeprivation of  either  his  substantive  or  procedural  due\n\nprocess rights under the Fourteenth  Amendment.  See Senra v.\n                                                          \n\nCunningham,  9  F.3d 168,  173  (1st Cir.  1993).   Appellant\n          \n\nproduced no  evidence, such  as that  he had  been physically\n\nabused,  detained  or  prosecuted  on   racial  or  political\n\ngrounds,  which  would support  a  jury finding  that  he had\n\nsuffered  a substantive due process violation.1  See id.

Moreover, the  recent Supreme  Court case of  Albright v.\n                                                          \nOliver,  114 S.Ct.  807  (1994), \"would  appear virtually  to\n      \nforeclose reliance  on substantive  due process as  the basis\nfor a viable malicious prosecution claim under section 1983.\"\nPerez-Ruiz v. Crespo-Guillen, 25 F.3d 40, 42 (1st Cir. 1994).\n                            \n\n     To  establish  a claim  of  malicious  prosecution under\n\nRhode  Island state  law,  appellant needed  to prove,  inter\n                                                             \n\nalia, that Officer Gawel lacked  probable cause to initiate a\n    \n\ncriminal proceeding against him.  Id. at 174.  Such a finding\n                                    \n\nwas precluded in the instant case, by the fact that appellant\n\nhad previously  been found guilty  of the criminal  charge in\n\nquestion  after trial  in  the Rhode  Island District  Court.\n\nEven though this verdict  was reversed after a jury  trial in\n\nthe  Rhode Island  Superior Court,  the determination  by the\n\nRhode Island District Court is nevertheless determinative  on\n\nthe issue of probable cause under Rhode Island law.  See Nagy\n                                                             \n\nv. McBurney, 120 R.I. 925, 931, 392 A.2d 365,  368 (1978) (\"a\n           \n\njudicial determination by a court of original jurisdiction in\n\nfavor  of the  person  who initiated  .  . .  proceedings  is\n\ngenerally held  to be conclusive evidence  of probable cause,\n\neven though  that  determination is  ultimately  reversed  on\n\nappeal, unless it is shown to have  been obtained by fraud or\n\nother imposition upon the court\") (citing cases).\n\n     Finally,  Gawel   presented  sufficient,  uncontradicted\n\nevidence  to demonstrate that he had a reasonable belief that\n\nprobable cause existed to arrest appellant.  Therefore, Gawel\n\nwas  entitled as a matter  of law to  qualified immunity from\n\nthe  claim  that he  had  violated  appellant's civil  rights\n\nthrough a  false arrest.   See Ricci v.  Urso, 974 F.2d  5, 7\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir. 1992).\n\n                             -3-\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -4-\n",
