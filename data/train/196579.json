Plaintiff\r                                                         \r\n\nappellants  are the widow and administratrix of the estate of\r\n\nGeorge  Stockwell  (Stockwell)   and  the  Stockwells'  minor\r\n\ndaughter.   Defendants  are Michael Sweeney  and the  City of\r\n\nProvidence, Rhode Island.   On May 6, 1993, while acting as a\r\n\ntraffic  officer  of  the   City,  Sweeney  shot  and  killed\r\n\nStockwell,  a driver of an  automobile.  Plaintiffs sue under\r\n\n42 U.S.C.    1983 and  Rhode Island's wrongful  death statute\r\n\n(concededly  raising  the  same  issue),  alleging  that  the\r\n\nofficer's   use  of   deadly   force  was   an  unreasonable,\r\n\nunjustified violation of Stockwell's Fourth Amendment rights.\r\n\nPlaintiffs'  appeal, following  a  jury verdict  in favor  of\r\n\ndefendants,  advances  three  principal   claims:    (1)  the\r\n\nevidence  warranted judgment  as  a matter  of  law in  their\r\n\nfavor, (2) the  court's instructions  regarding deadly  force\r\n\nwere  too   favorable  to  defendants,  and   (3)  the  court\r\n\nerroneously admitted testimony concerning Stockwell's alleged\r\n\nbelligerent  behavior  shortly before  the  encounter.   They\r\n\nfurther  appeal  denial of  post  trial motions  on  the same\r\n\ngrounds.  We affirm.\r\n\n                       Directed Finding\r                                                   \r\n\n          Plaintiffs introduced eight eyewitnesses, no two of\r\n\nwhom  fully agreed  with  each other.    All, in  one way  or\r\n\nanother,  disagreed  with  Sweeney, although  some  partially\r\n\nsupported him.   Plaintiffs' conclusion that  their testimony\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nwas  \"unequivocal, uncontradicted  and unimpeached\"  and that\r\n\nthe  finding in favor of defendants was so \"nonsensical\" that\r\n\nit should have been directed for plaintiffs could be answered\r\n\nin  one sentence:  We  fully agree with  the district court's\r\n\nstatement that the evidence  presented a \"classic question of\r\n\nfact.\"  It is a  rare case where a verdict can  be ordered in\r\n\nfavor of the party  having the burden  of proof, and this  is\r\n\nfar from such.   However, as the evidence bears also upon the\r\n\nquestion whether  plaintiffs' case  was prejudiced by  a less\r\n\nthan perfect charge, we will recount it to some extent.\r\n\n          First,  it was  tacitly or expressly  accepted that\r\n\nSabin Street,  Providence, runs, one  way, east to  west, and\r\n\nintersects with  Mathewson; that Sweeney, in  uniform, was on\r\n\nduty  at this intersection to direct cars bound west on Sabin\r\n\nStreet to  turn left onto  Mathewson because of  a children's\r\n\naffair ahead on  Sabin, and that Stockwell wished to continue\r\n\non.  At some point the officer  drew his service revolver and\r\n\nshot Stockwell in the groin, the bullet \"moving from right to\r\n\nleft,  and  from  front to  back.\"    (Surgeon).   Stockwell,\r\n\nhospitalized, died in a few hours.\r\n\n          Concededly this  is an unusual case.   According to\r\n\nOfficer Sweeney, Stockwell, who was  approaching fast, slowed\r\n\ndown  at his signal, ultimately  to a pace,  but continued on\r\n\ninto  the officer,  pushing  him backward  a couple  of feet.\r\n\nSweeney  yelled  repeatedly   for  Stockwell  to   stop,  but\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nStockwell,  shouting, \"Get out of my  way or I'll f'n run you\r\n\nover,\" hit him again, this time causing his torso to collapse\r\n\nover the hood and his right leg to rise into the air.  Within\r\n\nseconds Sweeney, in  fear, reached  for his gun  and fired  a\r\n\nsingle shot at Stockwell, aiming  through the windshield.  At\r\n\nthis time the car began turning to the left, in effect moving\r\n\nSweeney  to the  right.   (Cf. Carlson,  post.)   Although he\r                                                         \r\n\ninsisted  that he  aimed through  the windshield,  the bullet\r\n\ncame through the open window on the passenger  side.  On this\r\n\ndiscrepancy, though physically understandable on the basis of\r\n\nthe  car's movement,  plaintiffs hang  their as-matter-of-law\r\n\nclaim.\r\n\n          First, plaintiffs' witnesses, briefly.   (Stockwell\r\n\nwill  be referred  to  as  the  \"car,\"  and  Sweeney  as  the\r\n\n\"officer.\")\r\n\n          Joanna Johnson (school bus passenger)\r                                    \r\n\n          Officer  stepped away  from  in front  of the  car,\r\n\npushing  his hand  against  the  right  front  fender.    Car\r\n\nproceeded  and, after it had passed officer by \"a few steps,\"\r\n\nstopped, at which point officer  drew his gun and \"ran up  to\r\n\nthe passenger side of the car  . . . [and] put his gun in the\r\n\nwindow  . . . and  I  heard a  noise which  I  assumed was  a\r\n\ngunshot.\"\r\n\n          Susan Winsor (bus passenger)\r                                  \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n          First saw officer chasing  car, trying to grab onto\r\n\nit  and yelling  \"Stop!\"  \"The  car had turned  onto the side\r\n\nstreet, and the officer was on the passenger side.  He got up\r\n\nto about midway, maybe  like at the cross pieces  between the\r\n\ntwo windows.  And he looked like he was trying to  hold on at\r\n\none point with both hands.  And then he slipped away from the\r\n\ncar and that's when I heard a shot.\"\r\n\n          Kenneth  Carlson  (driver  of  car  directly behind\r                                      \r\n\nStockwell)\r\n\n          Saw  officer  gesture to  car  to  detour but  \"car\r\n\naccelerated really  quickly, threw the policeman  up onto the\r\n\nhood.\"   Car turned to  the left, throwing  officer around to\r\n\nthe passenger  side of  the  car, when  Carlson saw  officer,\r\n\npreviously  empty-handed, holding  a  gun.   On  contemporary\r\n\nstatement  to police Carlson had stated  that officer had run\r\n\nsix feet along the side of the car before pulling his gun and\r\n\nfiring into the car; and by deposition  that he ran after the\r\n\ncar two or three feet.\r\n\n          Melissa Iannotti (automobile driver)\r                                      \r\n\n          Stated on  direct examination she saw  officer make\r\n\nslow  run after  the  car, \"about  a  few car  lengths.\"   \"I\r\n\nremember his hands  on the car  and I heard  pop.\"  On  cross\r\n\nstated she saw the car turn to the right towards the officer.\r\n\nSaw him place his hands on  the hood.  Thought maybe his feet\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nwere  run over,  and that  the gun  was inside  the passenger\r\n\nwindow of the car when officer fired.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n          Richard Heines (children's bus driver)\r                                    \r\n\n          Saw officer  with his back against  the back window\r\n\nof  the  car, pivot  and  fire  through \"the  passenger  side\r\n\nwindow\"  and  then rotate  back  again.   (Obviously  car not\r\n\nmoving.)\r\n\n          David Mello (automobile driver)\r                                 \r\n\n          Had passed into Mathewson  Street ahead of car, saw\r\n\nofficer,  through  side-view mirror,  bumped, hands  onto the\r\n\nhood, dead  center.  Officer moved towards passenger side, at\r\n\nheadlight  was  \"bumped again,  a  little  harder this  time,\r\n\ncausing him to come down  onto the hood this way and  then he\r\n\nstepped around  the side of  the car.\"   The  car was  moving\r\n\nslowly and while standing  at fender, passenger side, officer\r\n\ndrew his  gun and,  after car  moved a  couple of  feet more,\r\n\nfired.  Entire incident took about 30 seconds.\r\n\n          Kim Maddalena (passenger in school bus)\r                                   \r\n\n          After car took slow left-hand turn onto  Mathewson,\r\n\nofficer chased  car from  behind.  Then,  \"I saw  him take  a\r\n\nstance, spread his legs  apart, and take his  gun out of  his\r\n\nholster and hold it like this and he  shot into the passenger\r\n\nside front window.\"\r\n\n          Debra Lusignan (passenger in school bus)\r                                    \r\n\n          After officer gestured, car stopped.  Saw some kind\r\n\nof  argument  between  car  and  officer  that  lasted a  few\r\n\nminutes.   Then made tight  left turn, brushing past officer,\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nand officer pushed  himself away.   As car proceeded  officer\r\n\nbanged on rear window and  yelled stop, and when car  did not\r\n\nstop  officer  ran after  it for  two  or three  car lengths,\r\n\ndrawing  his gun.  He  then stuck gun  inside front passenger\r\n\nwindow and fired.\r\n\n                           Comment\r                                              \r\n\n          So  much  for   what  plaintiffs  consider   \"minor\r\n\ninconsistencies on trivial  matters.\"  Testimony that  placed\r\n\nSweeney as coming from behind would seem clearly inconsistent\r\n\nwith a  bullet entering the  front of the  groin and out  the\r\n\nback; indeed that  point of  entry might be  thought odd  for\r\n\nanyone on foot at the car's side.  Plaintiffs' only reference\r\n\nto  the path  of the bullet  is to  say that  \"the absence of\r\n\nexactitude  in  identifying  the specific  locations  of  the\r\n\nparties and  vehicle is . . .  insubstantial on the  issue of\r\n\nwhether Sweeney had to shoot Stockwell in order to defend his\r\n\nlife.\"   Seemingly  there is  no difference  between shooting\r\n\nfrom the  hood when one has  been picked up on  a moving car,\r\n\nand shooting from  the side,  after coming from  behind in  a\r\n\nchase,  or standing alongside, legs spread, and both hands on\r\n\nthe  gun.  Again, there  is no difference  between being hit,\r\n\ncenter  hood, by  an oncoming car,  (two witnesses,  one said\r\n\nonce, one twice)1,  and chasing  a car that  had disobeyed  a\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Plaintiffs' brief characterizes inescapable  testimony as\r\n\"brushes,\"  a  word never  used by  a  witness, and  fails to\r\nmention Sweeney's (inescapable)  medical records, which  show\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\ntraffic order.  The correctness of  the denial of plaintiffs'\r\n\nmotion for judgment is manifest.\r\n\n                      Jury Instructions\r                                                   \r\n\n          It  is conceded that the court correctly instructed\r\n\nthe  jury that,  in  order to  establish  that the  officer's\r\n\ndecision to shoot was an unlawful or unreasonable  seizure in\r\n\nviolation  of  Stockwell's   Fourth  Amendment  rights,   the\r\n\nplaintiffs had  to prove,  first, that \"that  Officer Sweeney\r\n\nintentionally  shot  Mr.  Stockwell,\"  and  second, \"that  in\r\n\nshooting  [him] Officer Sweeney acted  in a way  that was not\r\n\nobjectively   reasonable  under  the   circumstances.\"    The\r\n\nestablishment  of the  first  element  was  uncontested;  the\r\n\nsecond  received the  following  amplification  by the  court\r\n\n(contested portions emphasized):\r\n\n               The standard for determining whether\r\n          the  use of  deadly  force  by  a  police\r\n          officer  was  objectively  reasonable  is\r\n          whether    under     the    circumstances\r\n          confronting  that  officer  a  reasonable\r\n          police  officer  would  have   used  such\r\n          force.\r\n\n               The  law permits a police officer to\r\n          use deadly force  to the extent necessary\r\n          to  protect himself or  others from death\r\n          or serious bodily injury.\r\n\n               The  law  also   permits  a   police\r                                                               \r\n          officer to use  deadly force  when it  is\r                                                               \r\n          necessary  to  prevent  the escape  of  a\r                                                               \r\n          suspected  felon  if   the  officer   has\r                                                               \r\n          reasonable  cause  to  believe  that  the\r                                                               \r\n          suspect  poses  a  significant threat  of\r                                                               \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nhim work disabled for three months.\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\n          death  or  serious bodily  injury  to the\r                                                               \r\n          officer or to other persons.\r                                                  \r\n\n               Assault with a dangerous weapon is a\r                                                               \r\n          felony.

Allowances must be\r\n          made to the extent that a police  officer\r\n          is forced to make  split-second decisions\r\n          under circumstances that may be  tense or\r\n          uncertain or rapidly changing.\r\n\n          The court's  mentioning  the law  as to  preventing\r\n\nescape was  irrelevant, but,  by the  same  token, we  cannot\r\n\nbelieve a jury, addressing  itself to Sweeney's asserted fear\r\n\nof  serious bodily  injury  would be  led  astray.   Of  more\r\n\npossible  concern  is  that  the  court's  definition  of  an\r\n\nautomobile used for an intentional striking (passing what may\r\n\nbe implicit in that strong  word) was an incomplete statement\r\n\nof Rhode Island criminal law.   In State v. Mercier, 415 A.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n465, 467 (R.I. 1980), the court said,\r\n\n          An automobile  in and  of  itself is  not\r\n          considered a dangerous weapon, but it may\r\n          become  so if  it is  employed in  such a\r\n          manner to render it capable of inflicting\r\n          death or serious bodily injury.\r\n\nWe do not, however, have  a criminal case.  The jury  was not\r\n\nconcerned with legalese, but with substance -- was Sweeney, a\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\ntraffic officer assigned  to protect  children from  oncoming\r\n\ncars, faced  with a driver so determined that he ran into him\r\n\ntwice, the second time harder (Sweeney and Mello), reasonable\r\n\nin fearing for  his safety?   We cannot  think that  judicial\r\n\ndefinitions  were  in  the  jurors' minds,  or  affected  the\r\n\nessential  fairness of the trial.   Elwood v.  Pina, 815 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n173, 177 (1st Cir. 1987).\r\n\n                  Evidence of Prior Conduct\r                                                       \r\n\n          Anthony Sajowski,  a  security guard  in  a  nearby\r\n\nbuilding,   had  encountered  Stockwell  shortly  before  the\r\n\nshooting  incident.     A   conversation   took  place   that\r\n\ndefendants,  before  trial,  gave  notice  they  intended  to\r\n\nintroduce.   Plaintiffs filed  a motion in  limine contending\r                                                              \r\n\nthat  its  substance  was,  in  effect,  character  evidence,\r\n\nFed.R.Evid. 404(b), and, further,  that it should be excluded\r\n\nbecause   the  danger   of  unfair   prejudice  substantially\r\n\noutweighed any probative value.  Fed.R.Evid. 403.   The court\r\n\ndenied the  motion \"without prejudice\" to the right to object\r\n\nat  trial,  noting  that  \"everyone  is  aware  of  what  the\r\n\npotential problems are  and we  will just have  to deal  with\r\n\nthat based  on the evidence  as it is  presented.\"  At  trial\r\n\nSajowski  testified,  over   periodic  objections  on   other\r\n\ngrounds,  that  Stockwell  had  disregarded   his  authority,\r\n\nrebuffed  his assistance,  was  \"aggravated\" and  had several\r\n\ntimes \"towered over\"  and confronted him in a provocative and\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\nbelligerent  manner,  and  that  he   had  felt  sufficiently\r\n\nthreatened to request local police assistance.  No objections\r\n\nfor any of the reasons put forth in the motion in limine were\r                                                                    \r\n\nmade.  Plaintiffs regard the motion as preserving the  issues\r\n\nraised therein for appeal.\r\n\n          Our  rule is that the filing and denial of a motion\r\n\nin  limine, without  subsequent contemporaneous  objection at\r                      \r\n\ntrial, will  normally not preserve an  evidentiary ruling for\r\n\nappeal.

Here the  court  very plainly\r\n\nindicated  that plaintiffs  should renew their  objections as\r\n\nthe evidence  came in.   Undo prejudice, Fed.R.Evid.  403, in\r\n\nparticular  is a  highly subjective  matter, and  plaintiffs'\r\n\nfailure to object -- it  is not for the court to  remember --\r\n\ndeprived the  court of its  requested opportunity to  rule on\r\n\nthe precise record.

Defendants are Michael Sweeney and the City of Providence, Rhode Island.   On May 6, 1993, while acting as a traffic officer of the City, Sweeney shot and killed Stockwell, a driver of an automobile.   Plaintiffs sue under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and Rhode Island's wrongful death statute (concededly raising the same issue), alleging that the officer's use of deadly force was an unreasonable, unjustified violation of Stockwell's Fourth Amendment rights.   Plaintiffs' appeal, following a jury verdict in favor of defendants, advances three principal claims:  (1) the evidence warranted judgment as a matter of law in their favor, (2) the court's instructions regarding deadly force were too favorable to defendants, and (3) the court erroneously admitted testimony concerning Stockwell's alleged belligerent behavior shortly before the encounter.   They further appeal denial of post trial motions on the same grounds.   We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Directed Finding</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs introduced eight eyewitnesses, no two of whom fully agreed with each other.   All, in one way or another, disagreed with Sweeney, although some partially supported him.   Plaintiffs' conclusion that their testimony was \"unequivocal, uncontradicted and unimpeached\" and that the finding in favor of defendants was so \"nonsensical\" that it should have been directed for plaintiffs could be answered in one sentence:  We fully agree with the district court's statement that the evidence presented a \"classic question of fact.\"   It is a rare case where a verdict can be ordered in favor of the party having the burden of proof, and this is far from such.   However, as the evidence bears also upon the question whether plaintiffs' case was prejudiced by a less than perfect charge, we will recount it to some extent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it was tacitly or expressly accepted that Sabin Street, Providence, runs, one way, east to west, and intersects with Mathewson;  that Sweeney, in uniform, was on duty at this intersection to direct cars bound west on Sabin Street to turn left onto Mathewson because of a children's affair ahead on Sabin, and that Stockwell wished to continue on.   At some point the officer drew his service revolver and shot Stockwell in the groin, the bullet \"moving from right to left, and from front to back.\"  (Surgeon).  Stockwell, hospitalized, died in a few hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concededly this is an unusual case.   According to Officer Sweeney, Stockwell, who was approaching fast, slowed down at his signal, ultimately to a pace, but continued on into the officer, pushing him backward a couple of feet.   Sweeney yelled repeatedly for Stockwell to stop, but Stockwell, shouting, \"Get out of my way or I'll f'n run you over,\" hit him again, this time causing his torso to collapse over the hood and his right leg to rise into the air.   Within seconds Sweeney, in fear, reached for his gun and fired a single shot at Stockwell, aiming through the windshield.   At this time the car began turning to the left, in effect moving Sweeney to the right.  (Cf. Carlson, post.)   Although he insisted that he aimed through the windshield, the bullet came through the open window on the passenger side.   On this discrepancy, though physically understandable on the basis of the car's movement, plaintiffs hang their as-matter-of-law claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, plaintiffs' witnesses, briefly.  (Stockwell will be referred to as the \"car,\" and Sweeney as the \"officer.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Joanna Johnson (school bus passenger)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer stepped away from in front of the car, pushing his hand against the right front fender.   Car proceeded and, after it had passed officer by \"a few steps,\" stopped, at which point officer drew his gun and \"ran up to the passenger side of the car ... [and] put his gun in the window ... and I heard a noise which I assumed was a gunshot.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Susan Winsor (bus passenger)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First saw officer chasing car, trying to grab onto it and yelling \"Stop!\" \"The car had turned onto the side street, and the officer was on the passenger side.   He got up to about midway, maybe like at the cross pieces between the two windows.   And he looked like he was trying to hold on at one point with both hands.   And then he slipped away from the car and that's when I heard a shot.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kenneth Carlson (driver of car directly behind Stockwell)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Saw officer gesture to car to detour but \"car accelerated really quickly, threw the policeman up onto the hood.\"   Car turned to the left, throwing officer around to the passenger side of the car, when Carlson saw officer, previously empty-handed, holding a gun.   On contemporary statement to police Carlson had stated that officer had run six feet along the side of the car before pulling his gun and firing into the car;  and by deposition that he ran after the car two or three feet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Melissa Iannotti (automobile driver)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stated on direct examination she saw officer make slow run after the car, \"about a few car lengths.\"  \"I remember his hands on the car and I heard pop.\"   On cross stated she saw the car turn to the right towards the officer.   Saw him place his hands on the hood.   Thought maybe his feet were run over, and that the gun was inside the passenger window of the car when officer fired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Richard Heines (children's bus driver)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Saw officer with his back against the back window of the car, pivot and fire through \"the passenger side window\" and then rotate back again.  (Obviously car not moving.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">David Mello (automobile driver)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had passed into Mathewson Street ahead of car, saw officer, through side-view mirror, bumped, hands onto the hood, dead center.   Officer moved towards passenger side, at headlight was \"bumped again, a little harder this time, causing him to come down onto the hood this way and then he stepped around the side of the car.\"   The car was moving slowly and while standing at fender, passenger side, officer drew his gun and, after car moved a couple of feet more, fired.   Entire incident took about 30 seconds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Kim Maddalena (passenger in school bus)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After car took slow left-hand turn onto Mathewson, officer chased car from behind.   Then, \"I saw him take a stance, spread his legs apart, and take his gun out of his holster and hold it like this and he shot into the passenger side front window.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Debra Lusignan (passenger in school bus)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After officer gestured, car stopped.   Saw some kind of argument between car and officer that lasted a few minutes.   Then made tight left turn, brushing past officer, and officer pushed himself away.   As car proceeded officer banged on rear window and yelled stop, and when car did not stop officer ran after it for two or three car lengths, drawing his gun.   He then stuck gun inside front passenger window and fired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Comment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So much for what plaintiffs consider \"minor inconsistencies on trivial matters.\"   Testimony that placed Sweeney as coming from behind would seem clearly inconsistent with a bullet entering the front of the groin and out the back;  indeed that point of entry might be thought odd for anyone on foot at the car's side.   Plaintiffs' only reference to the path of the bullet is to say that \"the absence of exactitude in identifying the specific locations of the parties and vehicle is ... insubstantial on the issue of whether Sweeney had to shoot Stockwell in order to defend his life.\"   Seemingly there is no difference between shooting from the hood when one has been picked up on a moving car, and shooting from the side, after coming from behind in a chase, or standing alongside, legs spread, and both hands on the gun.   Again, there is no difference between being hit, center hood, by an oncoming car, (two witnesses, one said once, one twice)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>, and chasing a car that had disobeyed a traffic order.   The correctness of the denial of plaintiffs' motion for judgment is manifest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is conceded that the court correctly instructed the jury that, in order to establish that the officer's decision to shoot was an unlawful or unreasonable seizure in violation of Stockwell's Fourth Amendment rights, the plaintiffs had to prove, first, that \"that Officer Sweeney intentionally shot Mr. Stockwell,\" and second, \"that in shooting [him] Officer Sweeney acted in a way that was not objectively reasonable under the circumstances.\"   The establishment of the first element was uncontested;  the second received the following amplification by the court (contested portions emphasized):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard for determining whether the use of deadly force by a police officer was objectively reasonable is whether under the circumstances confronting that officer a reasonable police officer would have used such force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law permits a police officer to use deadly force to the extent necessary to protect himself or others from death or serious bodily injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law also permits a police officer to use deadly force when it is necessary to prevent the escape of a suspected felon if the officer has reasonable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or to other persons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assault with a dangerous weapon is a felony.   Intentionally striking someone or attempting to strike someone with a motor vehicle constitutes an assault with a dangerous weapon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether a reasonable police officer would have considered it necessary to use deadly force, you must focus on the circumstances confronting that officer at the time the deadly force was used, rather than on how those circumstances may appear given the benefit of hindsight which, of course, is always twenty-twenty.   Allowances must be made to the extent that a police officer is forced to make split-second decisions under circumstances that may be tense or uncertain or rapidly changing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's mentioning the law as to preventing escape was irrelevant, but, by the same token, we cannot believe a jury, addressing itself to Sweeney's asserted fear of serious bodily injury would be led astray.   Of more possible concern is that the court's definition of an automobile used for an intentional striking (passing what may be implicit in that strong word) was an incomplete statement of Rhode Island criminal law.   In State v. Mercier, 415 A.2d 465, 467 (R.I.1980), the court said,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>An automobile in and of itself is not considered a dangerous weapon, but it may become so if it is employed in such a manner to render it capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not, however, have a criminal case.   The jury was not concerned with legalese, but with substance--was Sweeney, a traffic officer assigned to protect children from oncoming cars, faced with a driver so determined that he ran into him twice, the second time harder (Sweeney and Mello), reasonable in fearing for his safety?   We cannot think that judicial definitions were in the jurors' minds, or affected the essential fairness of the trial.  Elwood v. Pina, 815 F.2d 173, 177 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Evidence of Prior Conduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anthony Sajowski, a security guard in a nearby building, had encountered Stockwell shortly before the shooting incident.   A conversation took place that defendants, before trial, gave notice they intended to introduce.   Plaintiffs filed a motion in limine contending that its substance was, in effect, character evidence, Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), and, further, that it should be excluded because the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighed any probative value.   Fed.R.Evid. 403.   The court denied the motion \"without prejudice\" to the right to object at trial, noting that \"everyone is aware of what the potential problems are and we will just have to deal with that based on the evidence as it is presented.\"   At trial Sajowski testified, over periodic objections on other grounds, that Stockwell had disregarded his authority, rebuffed his assistance, was \"aggravated\" and had several times \"towered over\" and confronted him in a provocative and belligerent manner, and that he had felt sufficiently threatened to request local police assistance.   No objections for any of the reasons put forth in the motion in limine were made.   Plaintiffs regard the motion as preserving the issues raised therein for appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our rule is that the filing and denial of a motion in limine, without subsequent contemporaneous objection at trial, will normally not preserve an evidentiary ruling for appeal.  Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc., 21 F.3d 1181, 1189-1190 (1st Cir.1994) (citing cases).   Here the court very plainly indicated that plaintiffs should renew their objections as the evidence came in.   Undo prejudice, Fed.R.Evid. 403, in particular is a highly subjective matter, and plaintiffs' failure to object--it is not for the court to remember--deprived the court of its requested opportunity to rule on the precise record.  See Freeman v. Package Machinery Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1337-38 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs invoke the doctrine of plain error that permits late raising.  See Arrieta-Agressot v. United States, 3 F.3d 525, 528 (1st Cir.1993);  Clausen, 21 F.3d at 1190-1191.   The first question is whether it was error at all.   Plaintiffs have had a four day trial, with many witnesses.   We are especially hesitant to say from our poor vantage point, see Reagan v. Brock, 628 F.2d 721, 723 (1st Cir.1980), that plaintiffs should have a new trial because it would have been an abuse of discretion for the court not to have found that the prejudicial effect of this testimony substantially exceeded its possible relevance.   Instead, it is at least arguable that this was not a case where defendants were offering to show that Stockwell was of a belligerent character as permitting an inference that he was in character on this occasion.

Defendants are Michael Sweeney and the City of Providence, Rhode Island.   On May 6, 1993, while acting as a traffic officer of the City, Sweeney shot and killed Stockwell, a driver of an automobile.   Plaintiffs sue under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and Rhode Island's wrongful death statute (concededly raising the same issue), alleging that the officer's use of deadly force was an unreasonable, unjustified violation of Stockwell's Fourth Amendment rights.   Plaintiffs' appeal, following a jury verdict in favor of defendants, advances three principal claims:  (1) the evidence warranted judgment as a matter of law in their favor, (2) the court's instructions regarding deadly force were too favorable to defendants, and (3) the court erroneously admitted testimony concerning Stockwell's alleged belligerent behavior shortly before the encounter.   They further appeal denial of post trial motions on the same grounds.   We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Directed Finding</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs introduced eight eyewitnesses, no two of whom fully agreed with each other.   All, in one way or another, disagreed with Sweeney, although some partially supported him.   Plaintiffs' conclusion that their testimony was \"unequivocal, uncontradicted and unimpeached\" and that the finding in favor of defendants was so \"nonsensical\" that it should have been directed for plaintiffs could be answered in one sentence:  We fully agree with the district court's statement that the evidence presented a \"classic question of fact.\"   It is a rare case where a verdict can be ordered in favor of the party having the burden of proof, and this is far from such.   However, as the evidence bears also upon the question whether plaintiffs' case was prejudiced by a less than perfect charge, we will recount it to some extent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it was tacitly or expressly accepted that Sabin Street, Providence, runs, one way, east to west, and intersects with Mathewson;  that Sweeney, in uniform, was on duty at this intersection to direct cars bound west on Sabin Street to turn left onto Mathewson because of a children's affair ahead on Sabin, and that Stockwell wished to continue on.   At some point the officer drew his service revolver and shot Stockwell in the groin, the bullet \"moving from right to left, and from front to back.\"  (Surgeon).  Stockwell, hospitalized, died in a few hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concededly this is an unusual case.   According to Officer Sweeney, Stockwell, who was approaching fast, slowed down at his signal, ultimately to a pace, but continued on into the officer, pushing him backward a couple of feet.   Sweeney yelled repeatedly for Stockwell to stop, but Stockwell, shouting, \"Get out of my way or I'll f'n run you over,\" hit him again, this time causing his torso to collapse over the hood and his right leg to rise into the air.   Within seconds Sweeney, in fear, reached for his gun and fired a single shot at Stockwell, aiming through the windshield.   At this time the car began turning to the left, in effect moving Sweeney to the right.  (Cf. Carlson, post.)   Although he insisted that he aimed through the windshield, the bullet came through the open window on the passenger side.   On this discrepancy, though physically understandable on the basis of the car's movement, plaintiffs hang their as-matter-of-law claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, plaintiffs' witnesses, briefly.  (Stockwell will be referred to as the \"car,\" and Sweeney as the \"officer.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Joanna Johnson (school bus passenger)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer stepped away from in front of the car, pushing his hand against the right front fender.   Car proceeded and, after it had passed officer by \"a few steps,\" stopped, at which point officer drew his gun and \"ran up to the passenger side of the car ... [and] put his gun in the window ... and I heard a noise which I assumed was a gunshot.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Susan Winsor (bus passenger)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First saw officer chasing car, trying to grab onto it and yelling \"Stop!\" \"The car had turned onto the side street, and the officer was on the passenger side.   He got up to about midway, maybe like at the cross pieces between the two windows.   And he looked like he was trying to hold on at one point with both hands.   And then he slipped away from the car and that's when I heard a shot.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kenneth Carlson (driver of car directly behind Stockwell)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Saw officer gesture to car to detour but \"car accelerated really quickly, threw the policeman up onto the hood.\"   Car turned to the left, throwing officer around to the passenger side of the car, when Carlson saw officer, previously empty-handed, holding a gun.   On contemporary statement to police Carlson had stated that officer had run six feet along the side of the car before pulling his gun and firing into the car;  and by deposition that he ran after the car two or three feet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Melissa Iannotti (automobile driver)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stated on direct examination she saw officer make slow run after the car, \"about a few car lengths.\"  \"I remember his hands on the car and I heard pop.\"   On cross stated she saw the car turn to the right towards the officer.   Saw him place his hands on the hood.   Thought maybe his feet were run over, and that the gun was inside the passenger window of the car when officer fired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Richard Heines (children's bus driver)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Saw officer with his back against the back window of the car, pivot and fire through \"the passenger side window\" and then rotate back again.  (Obviously car not moving.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">David Mello (automobile driver)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had passed into Mathewson Street ahead of car, saw officer, through side-view mirror, bumped, hands onto the hood, dead center.   Officer moved towards passenger side, at headlight was \"bumped again, a little harder this time, causing him to come down onto the hood this way and then he stepped around the side of the car.\"   The car was moving slowly and while standing at fender, passenger side, officer drew his gun and, after car moved a couple of feet more, fired.   Entire incident took about 30 seconds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Kim Maddalena (passenger in school bus)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After car took slow left-hand turn onto Mathewson, officer chased car from behind.   Then, \"I saw him take a stance, spread his legs apart, and take his gun out of his holster and hold it like this and he shot into the passenger side front window.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Debra Lusignan (passenger in school bus)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After officer gestured, car stopped.   Saw some kind of argument between car and officer that lasted a few minutes.   Then made tight left turn, brushing past officer, and officer pushed himself away.   As car proceeded officer banged on rear window and yelled stop, and when car did not stop officer ran after it for two or three car lengths, drawing his gun.   He then stuck gun inside front passenger window and fired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Comment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So much for what plaintiffs consider \"minor inconsistencies on trivial matters.\"   Testimony that placed Sweeney as coming from behind would seem clearly inconsistent with a bullet entering the front of the groin and out the back;  indeed that point of entry might be thought odd for anyone on foot at the car's side.   Plaintiffs' only reference to the path of the bullet is to say that \"the absence of exactitude in identifying the specific locations of the parties and vehicle is ... insubstantial on the issue of whether Sweeney had to shoot Stockwell in order to defend his life.\"   Seemingly there is no difference between shooting from the hood when one has been picked up on a moving car, and shooting from the side, after coming from behind in a chase, or standing alongside, legs spread, and both hands on the gun.   Again, there is no difference between being hit, center hood, by an oncoming car, (two witnesses, one said once, one twice)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>, and chasing a car that had disobeyed a traffic order.   The correctness of the denial of plaintiffs' motion for judgment is manifest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is conceded that the court correctly instructed the jury that, in order to establish that the officer's decision to shoot was an unlawful or unreasonable seizure in violation of Stockwell's Fourth Amendment rights, the plaintiffs had to prove, first, that \"that Officer Sweeney intentionally shot Mr. Stockwell,\" and second, \"that in shooting [him] Officer Sweeney acted in a way that was not objectively reasonable under the circumstances.\"   The establishment of the first element was uncontested;  the second received the following amplification by the court (contested portions emphasized):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard for determining whether the use of deadly force by a police officer was objectively reasonable is whether under the circumstances confronting that officer a reasonable police officer would have used such force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law permits a police officer to use deadly force to the extent necessary to protect himself or others from death or serious bodily injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law also permits a police officer to use deadly force when it is necessary to prevent the escape of a suspected felon if the officer has reasonable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or to other persons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assault with a dangerous weapon is a felony.   Intentionally striking someone or attempting to strike someone with a motor vehicle constitutes an assault with a dangerous weapon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether a reasonable police officer would have considered it necessary to use deadly force, you must focus on the circumstances confronting that officer at the time the deadly force was used, rather than on how those circumstances may appear given the benefit of hindsight which, of course, is always twenty-twenty.   Allowances must be made to the extent that a police officer is forced to make split-second decisions under circumstances that may be tense or uncertain or rapidly changing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's mentioning the law as to preventing escape was irrelevant, but, by the same token, we cannot believe a jury, addressing itself to Sweeney's asserted fear of serious bodily injury would be led astray.   Of more possible concern is that the court's definition of an automobile used for an intentional striking (passing what may be implicit in that strong word) was an incomplete statement of Rhode Island criminal law.   In State v. Mercier, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2393146\"><a href=\"/opinion/2393146/state-v-mercier/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span>, 467 (R.I.1980), the court said,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>An automobile in and of itself is not considered a dangerous weapon, but it may become so if it is employed in such a manner to render it capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not, however, have a criminal case.   The jury was not concerned with legalese, but with substance--was Sweeney, a traffic officer assigned to protect children from oncoming cars, faced with a driver so determined that he ran into him twice, the second time harder (Sweeney and Mello), reasonable in fearing for his safety?   We cannot think that judicial definitions were in the jurors' minds, or affected the essential fairness of the trial.  Elwood v. Pina, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"485656\"><a href=\"/opinion/485656/simonne-elwood-and-cheryl-a-pimental-v-ronald-pina-and-lucia-cardoso/\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span>, 177 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Evidence of Prior Conduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anthony Sajowski, a security guard in a nearby building, had encountered Stockwell shortly before the shooting incident.   A conversation took place that defendants, before trial, gave notice they intended to introduce.   Plaintiffs filed a motion in limine contending that its substance was, in effect, character evidence, Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), and, further, that it should be excluded because the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighed any probative value.   Fed.R.Evid. 403.   The court denied the motion \"without prejudice\" to the right to object at trial, noting that \"everyone is aware of what the potential problems are and we will just have to deal with that based on the evidence as it is presented.\"   At trial Sajowski testified, over periodic objections on other grounds, that Stockwell had disregarded his authority, rebuffed his assistance, was \"aggravated\" and had several times \"towered over\" and confronted him in a provocative and belligerent manner, and that he had felt sufficiently threatened to request local police assistance.   No objections for any of the reasons put forth in the motion in limine were made.   Plaintiffs regard the motion as preserving the issues raised therein for appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our rule is that the filing and denial of a motion in limine, without subsequent contemporaneous objection at trial, will normally not preserve an evidentiary ruling for appeal.  Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668217\"><a href=\"/opinion/668217/eric-clausen-v-sea-3-inc-storage-tank-development-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></a></span>, 1189-1190 (1st Cir.1994) (citing cases).   Here the court very plainly indicated that plaintiffs should renew their objections as the evidence came in.   Undo prejudice, Fed.R.Evid. 403, in particular is a highly subjective matter, and plaintiffs' failure to object--it is not for the court to remember--deprived the court of its requested opportunity to rule on the precise record.  See Freeman v. Package Machinery Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"517427\"><a href=\"/opinion/517427/49-fair-emplpraccas-1139-48-empl-prac-dec-p-38456-27-fed-r-evid/\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1331</span></a></span>, 1337-38 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs invoke the doctrine of plain error that permits late raising.  See Arrieta-Agressot v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628961\"><a href=\"/opinion/628961/juan-arrieta-agressot-regulo-rios-jose-antonio-barroso-adalberto/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span>, 528 (1st Cir.1993);  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668217\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Clausen,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/668217/eric-clausen-v-sea-3-inc-storage-tank-development-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1190-1191</span></a></span>.   The first question is whether it was error at all.   Plaintiffs have had a four day trial, with many witnesses.   We are especially hesitant to say from our poor vantage point, see Reagan v. Brock, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"381359\"><a href=\"/opinion/381359/deborah-reagan-v-alice-brock-dba-alices-at-avaloch-and-avro/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">721</span></a></span>, 723 (1st Cir.1980), that plaintiffs should have a new trial because it would have been an abuse of discretion for the court not to have found that the prejudicial effect of this testimony substantially exceeded its possible relevance.   Instead, it is at least arguable that this was not a case where defendants were offering to show that Stockwell was of a belligerent character as permitting an inference that he was in character on this occasion.   Rather, it would be open here to find that actual belligerence of a few moments ago does not evaporate instanter, particularly when faced with further opposition and conflict.   The evidence could be thought direct, rather than inferential.
