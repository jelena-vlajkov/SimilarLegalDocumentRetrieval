Michael Haggert appeals the  district\r                                \n\ncourt's  grant of  summary judgment  in  favor of  the United\n\nStates,  Philips Medical  Systems,  Inc., Heritage  Bank  for\n\nSavings,  and  two  of   Heritage's  employees.    We  affirm\n\nessentially for  the reasons given  by the district  court in\n\nits decisions dated March 24, 1992 and March 24, 1994, adding\n\nonly the following comments.  \n\n          Haggert complains that  the district court did  not\n\naddress  his  allegation  that the  notice  of  levy  sent to\n\nHeritage  Bank violated  certain  provisions of  the Internal\n\nRevenue  Code  (\"Code\").   His  complaint  is without  merit,\n\nhowever, since  the court  did address the  alleged statutory\n\nviolations.  It correctly concluded that the Internal Revenue\n\nService  (\"IRS\")  could  effect  a  levy  on  Haggert's  bank\n\naccounts at Heritage  Bank by  sending the bank  a notice  of\n\nlevy.   See 26 U.S.C.   6331(b)  (\"The term 'levy' as used in\r                       \n\nthis title includes the power of distraint and seizure by any\n\nmeans.\"); IRS Reg.    301.6331-1(a)(1) (\"Levy may be made  by\n\nserving a notice of levy on any person in possession of . . .\n\nproperty subject to levy, including . . .  bank accounts, . .\n\n.  .\"); see also Schiff  v. Simon &amp;  Schuster, Inc., 780 F.2d\r                                                               \n\n210,  212  (2d Cir.  1985) (levy  on  property has  long been\n\neffected  by serving a notice  of levy, and  so an employee's\n\nargument that  the IRS could not levy on his wages by sending\n\na notice of levy to his employer was \"absolutely meritless\").\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nThe differing  language in  section 6331(a) to  which Haggert\n\npoints  -- the  statute permits  levying  on the  property of\n\ndelinquent taxpayers  \"by levy,\" but provides  for levying on\n\nthe salaries  of federal  employees  by \"notice  of levy\"  to\n\ntheir employers --  is not meaningful in view of the law just\n\ncited.  See  also Sims v.  United States,  359 U.S. 108,  113\r                                                    \n\n(1959) (   6331(a)'s provision relating to  levy upon federal\n\nemployees' salaries was enacted specifically to subject those\n\nsalaries \"to the same  collection procedures as are available\n\nagainst all other taxpayers\").\n\n          The district court also considered  Haggert's other\n\nclaims of procedural irregularity.  It essentially determined\n\nthat  it  need  not   consider  those  claims  in  evaluating\n\nHaggert's  suit against the bank.   As the  court noted, pre-\n\nlevy procedural requirements are imposed only on the IRS, and\n\nthe IRS had been dismissed from the suit.  We see no error in\n\nthe court's reasoning.   See, e.g., 26 U.S.C.    6331(a) (the\r                                              \n\nSecretary  of the  Treasury must  wait a specified  number of\n\ndays  after  providing  the   taxpayer  with  notice  of  his\n\noutstanding taxes  and demand  for payment before  levying on\n\nthe taxpayer's  property); id.  (d)(1) (the Secretary  of the\r                                          \n\nTreasury  may  not  levy  on  the  property  of  a delinquent\n\ntaxpayer until the  taxpayer has been given  a written notice\r                                \r                                \n\n1.  Although 26 U.S.C.    6332(c) requires banks to surrender\r            of intent  to levy); id. (d)(4)  (describing what information\r                                    \na delinquent  taxpayer's property  \"only after 21  days after\nservice  of levy,\"  Haggert  has not  claimed  that the  bank\r            the notice of  intent to  levy must contain).1   Moreover,  a\nfailed to wait the full 21 days after receiving the notice of\nlevy before complying with the notice.  \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nbank which has  received an  IRS notice of  levy must  comply\n\nwith the  levy, and has only two defenses -- that the bank is\n\nnot  in possession of the  property, or that  the property is\n\nsubject  to a  prior judicial attachment  or execution.   See\r                                                                         \n\nUnited States  v. National  Bank of  Commerce, 472  U.S. 713,\r                                                         \n\n722,  727 (1985); see 26  U.S.C.   6332(a)  (\"[A]ny person in\r                                 \n\npossession of (or obligated  with respect to) property .  . .\n\nupon which  a levy has been  made shall . .  . surrender such\n\nproperty . .  . to  the Secretary [of  the Treasury],  except\n\nsuch part of  the property . . .  as is, at the time  of such\n\ndemand,  subject  to an  attachment  or  execution under  any\n\njudicial process.\").  Thus,  any procedural errors  committed\n\nby  the IRS  in serving  the notice  of  levy would  not have\n\nexcused  the bank  from  its obligation  to  comply with  the\n\nnotice of  levy, and the  district court could  grant summary\n\njudgment   for  the  bank   without  first   considering  the\n\nsubstantive merits of the alleged errors by the IRS.2\n\n          Haggert also avers that  the United States has lost\n\nits sovereignty, having  previously declared bankruptcy,  and\n\nso could not be substituted for the individual IRS defendants\n\noriginally sued  by Haggert.   Since  Haggert did  not assert\n\nthis  claim below,  however,  he  has  waived it  on  appeal.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  In passing,  we also  note that Haggert's  claims of  IRS\nerror were meritless.\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nUnited  States  v. Ocasio-Rivera,  991  F.2d 1,  3  (1st Cir.\r                                            \n\n1993).  \n\n          Next,  Haggert says  that  the points  made in  his\n\n\"affidavits\" were never answered, so that summary judgment in\n\nhis favor was warranted.  Those affidavits did not attempt to\n\ndispute any  material fact in  this case,  however, but  were\n\nused  exclusively  to  argue Haggert's  case.    Accordingly,\n\nsummary  judgment  for  the  defendants was  proper.    See 6\r                                                                       \n\nMoore's  Federal Practice Pt. 2,   56.22[1], at 56-746 to 748\r                                     \n\n(1993 ed.) (\"The affidavit is no place for ultimate facts and\n\nconclusions of law, nor for argument of the party's cause.\").\n\n          Haggert's  remaining  claims  were either  resolved\n\ncorrectly  by  the  district  court  or  are  in  any   event\n\nmeritless, and so they need not be further discussed here.\n\n          Finally,  the  United  States  asks   us  to  award\n\nsanctions of  $1,500 against  Haggert for filing  a frivolous\n\nappeal.  In a  previous appeal by Haggert in a  related case,\n\nwe said that Haggert's arguments in support of his claim that\n\nhe was  not required  to pay  federal income  tax -- some  of\n\nwhich  are  reasserted in  this  appeal  -- were  \"meritless,\n\nindeed silly on their face.\"  See In re Haggert, No. 92-1519,\r                                                           \n\nslip  op. at  10 (1st  Cir. Dec.  22, 1992)  (unpublished per\n\ncuriam).  Haggert's  claim that the IRS  had violated certain\n\nCode  provisions  apparently was  not  made  in his  previous\n\nappeal,  but, as  the district  court found,  that  claim was\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nunavailing against the  bank.  Nonetheless, Haggert  appealed\n\nthe judgment  in favor of the bank, yet, on appeal, failed to\n\ndescribe any error  in that  finding.  He  also appealed  the\n\ngrant of  summary judgment for his  employer, Philips Medical\n\nSystems,  Inc.,   despite  the   court's  citation  of   Code\n\nprovisions which expressly immunized  Philips from this suit.\n\nSince Haggert should have known that his appeal had no chance\n\nof success, sanctions are  warranted.  See E.H. Ashley  &amp; Co.\r                                                                         \n\nv.

We affirm essentially for the reasons given by the district court in its decisions dated March 24, 1992 and March 24, 1994, adding only the following comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haggert complains that the district court did not address his allegation that the notice of levy sent to Heritage Bank violated certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (\"Code\").  His complaint is without merit, however, since the court did address the alleged statutory violations.  It correctly concluded that the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") could effect a levy on Haggert's bank accounts at Heritage Bank by sending the bank a notice of levy.  See 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6331(b) (\"The term 'levy' as used in this title includes the power of distraint and seizure by any means.\");  IRS Reg. Sec. 301.6331- 1(a)(1) (\"Levy may be made by serving a notice of levy on any person in possession of ... property subject to levy, including ... bank accounts, ....\");   see also Schiff v. Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc., 780 F.2d 210, 212 (2d Cir. 1985) (levy on property has long been effected by serving a notice of levy, and so an employee's argument that the IRS could not levy on his wages by sending a notice of levy to his employer was \"absolutely meritless\").  The differing language in section 6331(a) to which Haggert points-the statute permits levying on the property of delinquent taxpayers \"by levy,\" but provides for levying on the salaries of federal employees by \"notice of levy\" to their employers-is not meaningful in view of the law just cited.   See also Sims v. United States, 359 U.S. 108, 113 (1959) (Sec. 6331(a)'s provision relating to levy upon federal employees' salaries was enacted specifically to subject those salaries \"to the same collection procedures as are available against all other taxpayers\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also considered Haggert's other claims of procedural irregularity.  It essentially determined that it need not consider those claims in evaluating Haggert's suit against the bank.  As the court noted, pre-levy procedural requirements are imposed only on the IRS, and the IRS had been dismissed from the suit.  We see no error in the court's reasoning.  See, e.g., 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6331(a) (the Secretary of the Treasury must wait a specified number of days after providing the taxpayer with notice of his outstanding taxes and demand for payment before levying on the taxpayer's property);  id.  (d)(1) (the Secretary of the Treasury may not levy on the property of a delinquent taxpayer until the taxpayer has been given a written notice of intent to levy); id.  (d)(4) (describing what information the notice of intent to levy must contain).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Moreover, a bank which has received an IRS notice of levy must comply with the levy, and has only two defenses-that the bank is not in possession of the property, or that the property is subject to a prior judicial attachment or execution.   See United States v. National Bank of Commerce, 472 U.S. 713, 722, 727 (1985);  see 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6332(a) (\"[A]ny person in possession of (or obligated with respect to) property ... upon which a levy has been made shall ... surrender such property ... to the Secretary [of the Treasury], except such part of the property ... as is, at the time of such demand, subject to an attachment or execution under any judicial process.\").  Thus, any procedural errors committed by the IRS in serving the notice of levy would not have excused the bank from its obligation to comply with the notice of levy, and the district court could grant summary judgment for the bank without first considering the substantive merits of the alleged errors by the IRS.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haggert also avers that the United States has lost its sovereignty, having previously declared bankruptcy, and so could not be substituted for the individual IRS defendants originally sued by Haggert.  Since Haggert did not assert this claim below, however, he has waived it on appeal.   United States v. Ocasio-Rivera, 991 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Haggert says that the points made in his \"affidavits\" were never answered, so that summary judgment in his favor was warranted.  Those affidavits did not attempt to dispute any material fact in this case, however, but were used exclusively to argue Haggert's case.  Accordingly, summary judgment for the defendants was proper.  See 6 Moore's Federal Practice Pt. 2, p 56.22, at 56-746 to 748 (1993 ed.)  (\"The affidavit is no place for ultimate facts and conclusions of law, nor for argument of the party's cause.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haggert's remaining claims were either resolved correctly by the district court or are in any event meritless, and so they need not be further discussed here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the United States asks us to award sanctions of $1,500 against Haggert for filing a frivolous appeal.  In a previous appeal by Haggert in a related case, we said that Haggert's arguments in support of his claim that he was not required to pay federal income tax-some of which are reasserted in this appeal-were \"meritless, indeed silly on their face.\"  See In re Haggert, No. 92-1519, slip op. at 10 (1st Cir.  Dec. 22, 1992) (unpublished per curiam).  Haggert's claim that the IRS had violated certain Code provisions apparently was not made in his previous appeal, but, as the district court found, that claim was unavailing against the bank.  Nonetheless, Haggert appealed the judgment in favor of the bank, yet, on appeal, failed to describe any error in that finding.  He also appealed the grant of summary judgment for his employer, Philips Medical Systems, Inc., despite the court's citation of Code provisions which expressly immunized Philips from this suit.  Since Haggert should have known that his appeal had no chance of success, sanctions are warranted.   See E.H. Ashley &amp; Co. v. Wells Fargo Alarm Services, 907 F.2d 1274, 1280 (1st Cir. 1990) (it is enough to find an appeal frivolous under Fed.  R.

We affirm essentially for the reasons given by the district court in its decisions dated March 24, 1992 and March 24, 1994, adding only the following comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haggert complains that the district court did not address his allegation that the notice of levy sent to Heritage Bank violated certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (\"Code\").  His complaint is without merit, however, since the court did address the alleged statutory violations.  It correctly concluded that the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") could effect a levy on Haggert's bank accounts at Heritage Bank by sending the bank a notice of levy.  See 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6331(b) (\"The term 'levy' as used in this title includes the power of distraint and seizure by any means.\");  IRS Reg. Sec. 301.6331- 1(a)(1) (\"Levy may be made by serving a notice of levy on any person in possession of ... property subject to levy, including ... bank accounts, ....\");   see also Schiff v. Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">780</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></span>, 212 (2d Cir. 1985) (levy on property has long been effected by serving a notice of levy, and so an employee's argument that the IRS could not levy on his wages by sending a notice of levy to his employer was \"absolutely meritless\").  The differing language in section 6331(a) to which Haggert points-the statute permits levying on the property of delinquent taxpayers \"by levy,\" but provides for levying on the salaries of federal employees by \"notice of levy\" to their employers-is not meaningful in view of the law just cited.   See also Sims v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105851\"><a href=\"/opinion/105851/sims-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span>, 113 (1959) (Sec. 6331(a)'s provision relating to levy upon federal employees' salaries was enacted specifically to subject those salaries \"to the same collection procedures as are available against all other taxpayers\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also considered Haggert's other claims of procedural irregularity.  It essentially determined that it need not consider those claims in evaluating Haggert's suit against the bank.  As the court noted, pre-levy procedural requirements are imposed only on the IRS, and the IRS had been dismissed from the suit.  We see no error in the court's reasoning.  See, e.g., 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6331(a) (the Secretary of the Treasury must wait a specified number of days after providing the taxpayer with notice of his outstanding taxes and demand for payment before levying on the taxpayer's property);  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105851\"><a href=\"/opinion/105851/sims-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  (d)(1) (the </a></span>Secretary of the Treasury may not levy on the property of a delinquent taxpayer until the taxpayer has been given a written notice of intent to levy); <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105851\"><a href=\"/opinion/105851/sims-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  (d)(4) (describing </a></span>what information the notice of intent to levy must contain).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Moreover, a bank which has received an IRS notice of levy must comply with the levy, and has only two defenses-that the bank is not in possession of the property, or that the property is subject to a prior judicial attachment or execution.   See United States v. National Bank of Commerce, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111489\"><a href=\"/opinion/111489/united-states-v-national-bank-of-commerce/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span>, 722, 727 (1985);  see 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6332(a) (\"[A]ny person in possession of (or obligated with respect to) property ... upon which a levy has been made shall ... surrender such property ... to the Secretary [of the Treasury], except such part of the property ... as is, at the time of such demand, subject to an attachment or execution under any judicial process.\").  Thus, any procedural errors committed by the IRS in serving the notice of levy would not have excused the bank from its obligation to comply with the notice of levy, and the district court could grant summary judgment for the bank without first considering the substantive merits of the alleged errors by the IRS.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haggert also avers that the United States has lost its sovereignty, having previously declared bankruptcy, and so could not be substituted for the individual IRS defendants originally sued by Haggert.  Since Haggert did not assert this claim below, however, he has waived it on appeal.   United States v. Ocasio-Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604815\"><a href=\"/opinion/604815/united-states-v-richard-ocasio-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Haggert says that the points made in his \"affidavits\" were never answered, so that summary judgment in his favor was warranted.  Those affidavits did not attempt to dispute any material fact in this case, however, but were used exclusively to argue Haggert's case.  Accordingly, summary judgment for the defendants was proper.  See 6 Moore's Federal Practice Pt. 2, p 56.22, at 56-746 to 748 (1993 ed.)  (\"The affidavit is no place for ultimate facts and conclusions of law, nor for argument of the party's cause.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haggert's remaining claims were either resolved correctly by the district court or are in any event meritless, and so they need not be further discussed here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the United States asks us to award sanctions of $1,500 against Haggert for filing a frivolous appeal.  In a previous appeal by Haggert in a related case, we said that Haggert's arguments in support of his claim that he was not required to pay federal income tax-some of which are reasserted in this appeal-were \"meritless, indeed silly on their face.\"  See In re Haggert, No. 92-1519, slip op. at 10 (1st Cir.  Dec. 22, 1992) (unpublished per curiam).  Haggert's claim that the IRS had violated certain Code provisions apparently was not made in his previous appeal, but, as the district court found, that claim was unavailing against the bank.  Nonetheless, Haggert appealed the judgment in favor of the bank, yet, on appeal, failed to describe any error in that finding.  He also appealed the grant of summary judgment for his employer, Philips Medical Systems, Inc., despite the court's citation of Code provisions which expressly immunized Philips from this suit.  Since Haggert should have known that his appeal had no chance of success, sanctions are warranted.   See E.H. Ashley &amp; Co. v. Wells Fargo Alarm Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544608\"><a href=\"/opinion/544608/eh-ashley-co-inc-and-willow-associates-v-wells-fargo-alarm/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1274</span></a></span>, 1280 (1st Cir. 1990) (it is enough to find an appeal frivolous under Fed.
