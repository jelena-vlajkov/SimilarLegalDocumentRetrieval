DuBose,\n                                                                 \nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per  Curiam.    Appellant Peter  Georgacarakos  has\n                     \n\nappealed from the  district court's denial  of his motion  to\n\ncorrect sentence under 28 U.S.C.    2255.  Georgacarakos  was\n\nfound  guilty  of  possessing  and  distributing  cocaine  in\n\nviolation  of  21  U.S.C.     841.    Because  Georgacarakos'\n\ncriminal history included prior  convictions for a controlled\n\nsubstance  offense  and  for  burglary  of  a  dwelling,  the\n\ndistrict  court  ruled  that  Georgacarakos   was  a  \"career\n\noffender\"  under section  4B1.1 of the sentencing guidelines.\n\nThe court  therefore assigned Georgacarakos  an offense level\n\nof  32 (including  a  two-level reduction  for acceptance  of\n\nresponsibility) and  sentenced him to a  term of imprisonment\n\nof 260  months plus  a six-year  term  of supervised  release\n\nfollowing incarceration.\n\n          To  be sentenced  as  a career  offender under  the\n\nsentencing  guidelines, a defendant  must be presently guilty\n\nof  \"a  felony that  is  either  a  crime  of violence  or  a\n\ncontrolled substance  offense,\" and  must have had  \"at least\n\ntwo prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or\n\na  controlled substance  offense.\"   U.S.S.G.    4B1.1.   The\n\nguidelines define a \"crime of violence\" for these purposes to\n\ninclude \"any offense under federal or state law punishable by\n\nimprisonment  for a term  exceeding one  year that  . .  . is\n\nburglary of a dwelling . . . .\"  Id. at   4B1.2(1).\n                                    \n\n          Georgacarakos'   sole  argument   in  his      2255\n\npetition, and on appeal, is that this aspect of section 4B1's\n\ndefinition  of \"crime  of  violence\" is  impermissible.   His\n\nreasoning,  in   summary,  runs  as  follows.     Before  the\n\nsentencing guidelines were promulgated, Congress  already had\n\ndefined  \"crime  of  violence\"  in  28  U.S.C.    2901(c)  as\n\nincluding  \"burglary  or  housebreaking  in  the  nighttime.\"\n\nBurglary in the daytime, by implication, was excluded.  Under\n\n   2901(g), a  narcotics  offender charged  with  a crime  of\n\nviolence could not be  eligible for the civil  commitment and\n\nrehabilitation  programs  governed by  that  chapter.   Since\n\nCongress,  in 28  U.S.C.    994(a), later  directed that  the\n\nSentencing   Commission   promulgate  sentencing   guidelines\n\n\"consistent with  all pertinent provisions of  this title and\n\ntitle 18,  United States Code,\"  the definition of  \"crime of\n\nviolence\"  in   4B1 was  impermissible to the  extent that it\n\nwas inconsistent  with the  earlier definition in    2901(c).\n\nFurther, according  to Georgacarakos,  it would be  unfair to\n\nsubject defendants to such  inconsistency in the treatment of\n\nburglary of a dwelling in the daytime. \n\n          We reject  Georgacarakos' argument, and  affirm the\n\ndecision of the district court, for the reasons stated in the\n\ndistrict court's  February 26,  1993 order and  memorandum of\n\nopinion.  Section 2901  expressly states that the definitions\n\ncontained therein  are  for  the terms  \"[a]s  used  in  this\n\n                             -3-\n\nchapter,\" a chapter which is limited  to civil commitment and\n\nrehabilitation   of  narcotics   addicts.     That  section's\n\ndefinition of \"crime of violence,\" therefore, does not govern\n\nany use of the same term outside that chapter.  \n\n          Consequently,   the   inconsistency   between   the\n\ndefinitions of \"crime of violence\" in   4B1 of the sentencing\n\nguidelines and in   2901(c) is perfectly permissible and does\n\nnot  run afoul of the requirement of  28 U.S.C.   994(a) that\n\nthe  sentencing guidelines be  \"consistent with all pertinent\n\nprovisions\" of Titles 18  and 28.  Section  2901's definition\n\nof a \"crime of violence\" \"[a]s  used in this chapter\" did not\n\npreclude   Congress  from   choosing  to   define   the  term\n\ndifferently  in   a  different   context.    The      2901(c)\n\ndefinition,  therefore, was  not a  \"pertinent provision\"  of\n\nTitle  28 with  which  the sentencing  guidelines  had to  be\n\nconsistent.  \n\n          Indeed, as Georgacarakos himself concedes, Congress\n\npermissibly  defined  \"violent felony\"  in  the Armed  Career\n\nCriminal Act [\"ACCA\"], 18 U.S.C.   924(e)(2)(B), as including\n\nsimply \"burglary,\" also a definition  substantially different\n\nfrom  the definition  of \"crime  of violence\"  in    2901(c).\n\nAccording to Georgacarakos, \"Had Congress [in   4B1] intended\n\nany  other meaning than that  given crime of  violence in [ ]\n\n2901, it  would have created a  new term, just  as it created\n\nthe term 'violent  felony' when it  enacted the Armed  Career\n\n                             -4-\n\nCriminal  Act  .  .  .  .    Congress  intended  a  different\n\ndefinition  for that  act so  it created  a  term to  fit its\n\nintentions.  This is what Congress would have done [in   4B1]\n\nhad it intended  any other definition  for crime of  violence\n\nthan  the  one it  has  had  for  two  decades.\"    Thus,  by\n\nGeorgacarakos' reasoning, if   4B1, like the ACCA, had simply\n\nused  the   term  \"violent  felony\"  instead   of  \"crime  of\n\nviolence,\"   but   with   precisely   the   same  substantive\n\ndefinition, there would be no problem.  \n\n          We  will  not,  in  these  circumstances  at least,\n\nattach so much  importance to the labels placed  on statutory\n\nconcepts.   The mere fact that    4B1 uses the  same words --\n\n\"crime of violence\" -- as  in   2901(c) does not  require any\n\ndifferent result than if   4B1 employed some different label.\n\nIndeed, as we  noted in United  States v. Fiore,  983 F.2d  1\n                                               \n\n(1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1830 (1993), \"[t]he\n                             \n\ndefinition  of  'violent  felony'  in  the  ACCA's   sentence\n\nenhancement provision is the  source of the language used  in\n\ndefining a 'crime of  violence' under U.S.S.G.    4B1.2 (Nov.\n\n1991).  Decisions interpreting the ACCA constitute persuasive\n\nauthority  when a court is called upon to construe the career\n\noffender guideline.\"  Id. at 3 n.2 (citations omitted).  \n                         \n\n          The  real crux of  Georgacarakos' argument  is that\n\nthe choice of the label \"crime of violence\" must nevertheless\n\nbe determinative because that label must logically carry with\n\n                             -5-\n\nit   2901(c)'s pre-existing  definition of that term.   As we\n\nhave already  ruled, this argument fails  because   2901(c)'s\n\ndefinition is  expressly limited  to the  term's use  in that\n\nchapter.  \n\n          Nor do we see any adverse practical consequences of\n\nthe presence  of different definitions  of the  same term  in\n\nthese  two  contexts.   As  the district  court  pointed out,\n\ncommission  of a \"crime of violence\" under   2901 precludes a\n\nnarcotics  offender  from  participation   in  rehabilitation\n\nprograms  in lieu  of imprisonment,  whereas commission  of a\n\n\"crime of violence\" under    4B1 may lead to  career offender\n\nstatus  under the  sentencing  guidelines,  resulting  in  an\n\nenhanced   sentence.      These  are   two   very   different\n\ndeterminations  that would  not foreseeably  overlap at  all.\n\nFor  that  reason, the  differing  definitions  should create\n\nneither   unfairness   for    offenders   nor    interpretive\n\ndifficulties  for  courts.    There is  no  genuine  conflict\n\nbetween them.\n\n          The  district  court's  denial   of  Georgacarakos'\n\nmotion under 28 U.S.C.   2255 is affirmed.\n                                         \n\n                             -6-\n",

Further, according to Georgacarakos, it would be unfair to subject defendants to such inconsistency in the treatment of burglary of a dwelling in the daytime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Georgacarakos' argument, and affirm the decision of the district court, for the reasons stated in the district court's February 26, 1993 order and memorandum of opinion.  Section 2901 expressly states that the definitions contained therein are for the terms \"[a]s used in this chapter,\" a chapter which is limited to civil commitment and rehabilitation of narcotics addicts.  That section's definition of \"crime of violence,\" therefore, does not govern any use of the same term outside that chapter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, the inconsistency between the definitions of \"crime of violence\" in &#167; 4B1 of the sentencing guidelines and in &#167; 2901(c) is perfectly permissible and does not run afoul of the requirement of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(a) that the sentencing guidelines be \"consistent with all pertinent provisions\" of Titles 18 and 28.  Section 2901's definition of a \"crime of violence\" \"[a]s used in this chapter\" did not preclude Congress from choosing to define the term differently in a different context.  The &#167; 2901(c) definition, therefore, was not a \"pertinent provision\" of Title 28 with which the sentencing guidelines had to be consistent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, as Georgacarakos himself concedes, Congress permissibly defined \"violent felony\" in the Armed Career Criminal Act [\"ACCA\"], 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(2)(B), as including simply \"burglary,\" also a definition substantially different from the definition of \"crime of violence\" in &#167; 2901(c).  According to Georgacarakos, \"Had Congress [in &#167; 4B1] intended any other meaning than that given crime of violence in [&#167; ] 2901, it would have created a new term, just as it created the term 'violent felony' when it enacted the Armed Career Criminal Act....  Congress intended a different definition for that act so it created a term to fit its intentions.  This is what Congress would have done [in &#167; 4B1] had it intended any other definition for crime of violence than the one it has had for two decades.\"  Thus, by Georgacarakos' reasoning, if &#167; 4B1, like the ACCA, had simply used the term \"violent felony\" instead of \"crime of violence,\" but with precisely the same substantive definition, there would be no problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not, in these circumstances at least, attach so much importance to the labels placed on statutory concepts.  The mere fact that &#167; 4B1 uses the same words-\"crime of violence\"-as in &#167; 2901(c) does not require any different result than if &#167; 4B1 employed some different label.  Indeed, as we noted in  United States v. Fiore, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597517\"><a href=\"/opinion/597517/united-states-v-anthony-fiore/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1830</span> </span>(1993), \"[t]he definition of 'violent felony' in the ACCA's sentence enhancement provision is the source of the language used in defining a 'crime of violence' under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2 (Nov. 1991).  Decisions interpreting the ACCA constitute persuasive authority when a court is called upon to construe the career offender guideline.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 3 </span>n.2 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The real crux of Georgacarakos' argument is that the choice of the label \"crime of violence\" must nevertheless be determinative because that label must logically carry with it &#167; 2901(c)'s pre-existing definition of that term.  As we have already ruled, this argument fails because &#167; 2901(c)'s definition is expressly limited to the term's use in that chapter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we see any adverse practical consequences of the presence of different definitions of the same term in these two contexts.  As the district court pointed out, commission of a \"crime of violence\" under &#167; 2901 precludes a narcotics offender from participation in rehabilitation programs in lieu of imprisonment, whereas commission of a \"crime of violence\" under &#167; 4B1 may lead to career offender status under the sentencing guidelines, resulting in an enhanced sentence.  These are two very different determinations that would not foreseeably overlap at all.  For that reason, the differing definitions should create neither unfairness for offenders nor interpretive difficulties for courts.  There is no genuine conflict between them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's denial of Georgacarakos' motion under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
