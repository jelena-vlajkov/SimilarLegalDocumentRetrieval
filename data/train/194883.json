Defendant-appellant Jose R. Gonzalez-\n                       \n\n  Negron seeks to have his sentence vacated and recalculated in\n\n  the  district  court  on  the  grounds  that  the  government\n\n  breached  its  plea   agreement  with  him.   In  particular,\n\n  defendant contends  the government promised to  file a  5K1.1\n\n  motion  for downward  departure, but  failed to  do so.   The\n\n  district  court  found  that  the  government  made  no  such\n\n  promise.   Appellant further  argues that the  district court\n\n  erred  in  concluding that  it had  no  authority to  grant a\n\n   5K1.1  departure  absent a  motion  by the  government.   We\n\n  affirm.      \n\n                            Background\n                                      \n\n            Appellant pled  guilty to two counts  of a four-count\n\nindictment  charging him  with stealing  and concealing  firearms\n\ncontained in packages intended to be conveyed or delivered by the\n\nPostal Service and which he came  to possess as a Postal  Service\n\nemployee,  in  violation  of  18  U.S.C.       1709,  922(j)  and\n\n924(a)(2).  In return  for appellant's guilty plea to  counts one\n\nand two, the  government agreed  to request  dismissal of  counts\n\nthree and  four and, at the time of sentence, to inform the Court\n\nof  \"the extent and nature of defendant's cooperation.\"  The plea\n\nagreement further provided as follows:\n\n            6.   [Defendant  enters   the  agreement]\n            without   .   .  .   promises   from  the\n            [government] other  than those explicitly\n            indicated in this document.\n\n                               -3-\n\n            7.  No  additional  promises,   terms  or\n            conditions have been  entered into  other\n            than   those  set  forth   in  this  plea\n            agreement and none will be entered unless\n            in writing and signed by all parties.\n\n            The Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) set forth the following\n\nfacts.  On November  8, 1991, a registered parcel  containing two\n\nrevolvers was mailed from Birmingham, Alabama and an unregistered\n\nparcel  containing two  pistols was  mailed from  Miami, Florida.\n\nBoth packages were  addressed to  a gun shop  in Bayamon,  Puerto\n\nRico.   The  packages were  stolen from  the Bayamon  branch Post\n\nOffice  on November 13, 1991.  One of appellant's co-workers told\n\npostal inspectors that appellant was responsible for the thefts.\n\n            A few  weeks after the  theft, appellant sold  one of\n\nthe pistols to a Puerto Rico Police Department undercover  agent.\n\nAppellant sold the  other pistol to an acquaintance for  $700.  A\n\nthird firearm was discovered by appellant's father in appellant's\n\ncar.  In an  interview with a postal inspector,  appellant stated\n\nthat he had  received from his co-worker  a yellow slip of  paper\n\nfor retrieving  the  packages.   He  had given  the  slip to  his\n\nneighbor,  a minor,  who subsequently  obtained the  packages and\n\ndelivered the firearms contained therein to appellant.\n\n            The PSR  reiterated the terms of  the plea agreement,\n\nincluding that \"the government will . . . inform the court at the\n\ntime of  sentencing regarding the  extent and nature  of whatever\n\ncooperation is provided by the defendant.\"  The probation officer\n\nrecommended a base offense level (BOL)  of 12, to be increased by\n\n                              - 4 -\n                                4\n\n1 level because the offense involved more than two, but less than\n\nfive, firearms.  The PSR further recommended an upward adjustment\n\nin the BOL of two levels  for appellant's role in the offense and\n\na  downward  adjustment  of  two  levels  for  his  acceptance of\n\nresponsibility.   Based upon the recommended  total offense level\n\nof 13 and a criminal history category of I, the probation officer\n\narrived at a guideline imprisonment range of 12 to 18 months.\n\n            In discussing factors  that may warrant a  departure,\n\nthe PSR advised as follows:\n\n            A downward departure may be considered by\n            the Court based  on the cooperation which\n            the  defendant  has  afforded  government\n            authorities.      According   to   Postal\n            Inspector  J.R. Cottes,  as  a result  of\n            information  provided  by the  defendant,\n            accomplice  Jacques  Orsini-Martinez,   a\n            minor,  was   arrested  and  successfully\n            prosecuted by state authorities.\n\nThe  PSR also  noted that  appellant had  been arrested  by local\n\nauthorities and charged with unlawful sale and illegal possession\n\nof  a firearm,  arising  out of  the  same facts  underlying  the\n\nfederal indictment.  Trial was at that time pending in the Puerto\n\nRico Superior Court.\n\n            At  the sentencing  hearing on  October 7,  1992, the\n\ncourt  began by  asking appellant  if he had  anything to  say in\n\nmitigation  of  punishment.    Appellant  (through  his  counsel)\n\nresponded  by  stating  that  he   had  been  informed  that  the\n\ngovernment would  not move for  a downward departure  pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G.   5K1.1.    Appellant  objected  that  he  had  provided\n\n                              - 5 -\n                                5\n\nsubstantial assistance to the government, resulting in successful\n\nprosecution in the Puerto Rico courts of a minor who was involved\n\nin  the  offense   with  him.    Appellant   contended  that  the\n\ngovernment's failure to make a  5K1.1 motion constituted a breach\n\nof the plea agreement.\n\n            The  court  asked  the   government  to  respond  and\n\nspecifically  asked,  pursuant  to  the  plea  agreement,  to  be\n\ninformed  about  the  defendant's  cooperation.   The  government\n\nstated that at the time the plea agreement  was entered, the type\n\nof cooperation expected from  appellant was the surrender  of the\n\ntwo missing firearms or the identification of the persons to whom\n\nthey'd  been   delivered.  This  cooperation  was  not  received.\n\nAppellant  neither  delivered  the  guns to  the  government  nor\n\nidentified the persons to whom he had delivered them.\n\n            Appellant   then   argued   that  he   had   provided\n\ncooperation in  locating the  missing weapons  by meeting with  a\n\nspecial agent  of  the federal  Bureau  of Alcohol,  Tobacco  and\n\nFirearms and telling  him to whom he had given  the firearms.  In\n\naddition, he had met  with one of the  recipients of the  missing\n\nfirearms.  That person was murdered on the day after the meeting,\n\ndefeating appellant's  plans to retrieve the  firearm.  Appellant\n\nattempted, also  unsuccessfully, to  locate the recipient  of the\n\nother missing  weapon.   In view  of this  cooperation, appellant\n\nargued  that  the  government's  refusal  to  move  for a   5K1.1\n\ndeparture was arbitrary and capricious.\n\n                              - 6 -\n                                6\n\n            The district court  ruled that  in the  absence of  a\n\nmotion  by the  government, and  without  any evidence  that \"the\n\ngovernment is  lying or  is not  telling the  truth or  is hiding\n\nevidence,\" it was without authority to depart from the guidelines\n\npursuant to  U.S.S.G.  5K1.1.   The court sentenced  appellant to\n\ntwelve  months'   imprisonment  on  each  count,   to  be  served\n\nconcurrently.    The  sentencing  judge  explained  that  he  was\n\nimposing  a  sentence  at the  low  end  of  the guideline  range\n\n\"because  of  [appellant's]  youth  and  the  fact  that  he  has\n\ncooperated  in a way,  not too much  but in a way  with the local\n\ngovernment, but it is not enough for a departure under Section 5K\n\nof the guidelines.\"\n\n            On  October 13,  1992,  appellant filed  a notice  of\n\nappeal  (Appeal No. 92-2224).  The next day, appellant filed with\n\nthe  district  court  a  motion  to  correct  or reduce  sentence\n\npursuant  to Fed.  R.  Crim. P.  35(c).   Appellant  requested  a\n\nhearing on the issue of the government's breach of its obligation\n\nunder  the plea agreement to  move for a  downward departure from\n\nthe guidelines pursuant to U.S.S.G.  5K1.1.   This court remanded\n\nto the district court for a ruling on the Rule 35(c) motion.\n\n            The district court held a hearing on appellant's Rule\n\n35(c) motion on January 28, 1993.  The court ruled  that the plea\n\nagreement  did not provide that  the government would  move for a\n\nreduction pursuant to U.S.S.G.   5K1.1.  Appellant protested that\n\nit  was his understanding when he entered the plea agreement that\n\n                              - 7 -\n                                7\n\n\"the Government would advise [the court] as to what he cooperated\n\n. . . so that [the court] could make the downward departure under\n\n5K.\"  The district court, citing  the \"zipper clause\" in the plea\n\nagreement, providing  that no  additional promises would  be made\n\nunless  in writing  and signed  by both  parties, ruled  that the\n\ngovernment was  only obliged to  advise the court  of appellant's\n\ncooperation, but not  to move for a  5K1.1  reduction.  The court\n\nfound that the government had met its obligation:\n\n            They  complied with  that  part of  their\n            agreement,  and I remember  they told the\n            court what has happened with the weapons.\n            So  they  did  comply  by  informing  the\n            court.\n\nTherefore,  the district  court  denied  appellant's  Rule  35(c)\n\nmotion.  Appellant filed this appeal.\n\n                            Discussion\n                                      \n\n            Breach of Plea Agreement\n                                    \n\n            Regardless whether we apply a clearly erroneous or de\n\nnovo  standard of  review to  the district  court's determination\n\nthat the plea agreement  was not violated, compare United  States\n                                                                 \n\nv.  Tilley, 964  F.2d 66,  71 (1st  Cir. 1992)  (applying clearly\n          \n\nerroneous  standard), with   Kingsley v. United  States, 968 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n109, 114 (1st Cir.  1992) (applying de novo standard),  we uphold\n\nthe  district court's finding of  no breach.   The district court\n\nfound that  the plea agreement  did not include a  promise by the\n\ngovernment to  move  for  a  reduction of  sentence  pursuant  to\n\n 5K1.1.  That  finding is fully  supported by the  record.    The\n\n                              - 8 -\n                                8\n\nplea  agreement makes no mention  of  5K1.1.   Nor does appellant\n\ncontend that any other written or oral agreement was entered.   \n\n            Appellant merely  contends that he  inferred from the\n\ngovernment's promise to inform the court of his cooperation  that\n\nit would also  move for a  5K1.1  departure.  The  plea agreement\n\nspecified,  however,  that  the   government  had  not  made  any\n\nadditional  promises and  that \"none  will be  entered  unless in\n\nwriting and signed by  all parties.\"  At the guilty plea hearing,\n\nappellant  specifically acknowledged  that  \"everything that  was\n\npromised [him] is  included, is inserted  in this document  which\n\nmeans that anything else which  is not here does not exist  or is\n\nnot binding upon the government or upon [him].\"\n\n            Although appellant's reasonable understanding  of the\n\ngovernment's  obligations  under  the plea  agreement  should  be\n\nenforced, in this case a promise to move for a departure under \n\n 5K1.1 could not  reasonably be implied from the plea agreement's\n\npromise  to  inform  the  court  of  the  extent  of  appellant's\n\ncooperation.   See, e.g., United  States v. Massey,  No. 92-3409,\n                                                  \n\n1993  U.S. App. LEXIS 16409  (10th Cir. July  1, 1993) (rejecting\n\nappellant's argument that plea agreement, providing only that the\n\ngovernment would  inform the court  of the extent  of defendant's\n\ncooperation,  obligated  the  government  to move  for  a   5K1.1\n\ndeparture).  As we said in United States v. Atwood, 963 F.2d 476,\n                                                  \n\n479 (1st  Cir. 1992), \"[i]t  is nose-on-the-face  plain that  the\n\n                              - 9 -\n                                9\n\n[plea  agreement] did not obligate  the government to  move for a\n\ndownward departure based on appellant's cooperation.\"\n\n            Appellant  does  not   contend  that  the  government\n\nrefused to inform  the court of  the \"extent and  nature\" of  his\n\ncooperation.     Rather,  appellant's   complaint  is  that   the\n\ngovernment  refused to file a   5K1.1 motion.   As the government\n\nnever  promised to make a   5K1.l motion, the  government did not\n\nviolate the  plea  agreement by  failing  to request  a  downward\n\ndeparture.\n\n            Section 5K1.1 Departure\n                                   \n\n            Appellant    argues    that   the    district   court\n\nmisinterpreted U.S.S.G  5K1.1 as requiring a government motion as\n\na  prerequisite to  a downward  departure based  upon appellant's\n\nsubstantial assistance.    We disagree.   Section 5K1.1 provides,\n\nin relevant part, as follows:\n\n            Upon  motion  of  the government  stating\n            that    the   defendant    has   provided\n            substantial     assistance     in     the\n            investigation  or prosecution  of another\n            person who has  committed an offense, the\n            court may depart from the guidelines.\n\nU.S.S.G   5K1.1.  As this court has recently noted, \"a government\n\nmotion  is  a sine  qua  non to  a  departure  for a  defendant's\n                            \n\nsubstantial assistance, see Wade v.

United\n                                                                 \n\nStates,  112 S.  Ct.  1840,  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  the\n      \n\n                              - 10 -\n                                10\n\ngovernment's  decision  not  to  move for  a  downward  departure\n\npursuant to  5K1.1 was subject to judicial review and reversal if\n\nthe refusal is found to be based upon an unconstitutional motive.\n\nThe Court held  that an  arbitrary refusal of  the government  to\n\nfile  a   5K1.1  motion,  in  that it  \"was  not  related  to any\n\nlegitimate government  end,\" would  entitle appellant  to relief.\n\nId. at 1844.\n  \n\n            At his sentencing hearing, appellant  argued that the\n\ngovernment's failure to move for a  5K1.1 departure was arbitrary\n\nand capricious.  As  in Wade,  however, appellant's  only support\n                            \n\nfor his position  was the  extent of cooperation  provided.   The\n\nCourt in  Wade held that  \"[t]his of course, was  not enough, for\n              \n\nalthough  a showing  of assistance is  a necessary  condition for\n\nrelief,  it is not  a sufficient one.\"   Id.   Similarly, in this\n                                           \n\ncase,   even    assuming   that   appellant's    assistance   was\n\n\"substantial,\"  he is  not entitled  to relief.    The government\n\nexplained  at the sentencing hearing  that the reason  it did not\n\nmove  for  a  downward  departure  was  that  appellant  had  not\n\nfulfilled  his promise to deliver the missing guns or provide the\n\nnames  of the persons  to whom  he sold  them.   The government's\n\nfailure  to move for a departure for this reason is not arbitrary\n\nor capricious.   The district  court did not  err in  determining\n\nthat it had no  authority to grant a downward  departure pursuant\n\nto U.S.S.G.  5K1.1 absent a motion from the government.\n\n            Appellant's conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n                                                            \n\n                              - 11 -\n                                11\n",

Defendant-appellant Jose R. Gonzalez-\n                       \n\n  Negron seeks to have his sentence vacated and recalculated in\n\n  the  district  court  on  the  grounds  that  the  government\n\n  breached  its  plea   agreement  with  him.   In  particular,\n\n  defendant contends  the government promised to  file a  5K1.1\n\n  motion  for downward  departure, but  failed to  do so.   The\n\n  district  court  found  that  the  government  made  no  such\n\n  promise.   Appellant further  argues that the  district court\n\n  erred  in  concluding that  it had  no  authority to  grant a\n\n   5K1.1  departure  absent a  motion  by the  government.   We\n\n  affirm.      \n\n                            Background\n                                      \n\n            Appellant pled  guilty to two counts  of a four-count\n\nindictment  charging him  with stealing  and concealing  firearms\n\ncontained in packages intended to be conveyed or delivered by the\n\nPostal Service and which he came  to possess as a Postal  Service\n\nemployee,  in  violation  of  18  U.S.C.       1709,  922(j)  and\n\n924(a)(2).  In return  for appellant's guilty plea to  counts one\n\nand two, the  government agreed  to request  dismissal of  counts\n\nthree and  four and, at the time of sentence, to inform the Court\n\nof  \"the extent and nature of defendant's cooperation.\"  The plea\n\nagreement further provided as follows:\n\n            6.   [Defendant  enters   the  agreement]\n            without   .   .  .   promises   from  the\n            [government] other  than those explicitly\n            indicated in this document.\n\n                               -3-\n\n            7.  No  additional  promises,   terms  or\n            conditions have been  entered into  other\n            than   those  set  forth   in  this  plea\n            agreement and none will be entered unless\n            in writing and signed by all parties.\n\n            The Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) set forth the following\n\nfacts.  On November  8, 1991, a registered parcel  containing two\n\nrevolvers was mailed from Birmingham, Alabama and an unregistered\n\nparcel  containing two  pistols was  mailed from  Miami, Florida.\n\nBoth packages were  addressed to  a gun shop  in Bayamon,  Puerto\n\nRico.   The  packages were  stolen from  the Bayamon  branch Post\n\nOffice  on November 13, 1991.  One of appellant's co-workers told\n\npostal inspectors that appellant was responsible for the thefts.\n\n            A few  weeks after the  theft, appellant sold  one of\n\nthe pistols to a Puerto Rico Police Department undercover  agent.\n\nAppellant sold the  other pistol to an acquaintance for  $700.  A\n\nthird firearm was discovered by appellant's father in appellant's\n\ncar.  In an  interview with a postal inspector,  appellant stated\n\nthat he had  received from his co-worker  a yellow slip of  paper\n\nfor retrieving  the  packages.   He  had given  the  slip to  his\n\nneighbor,  a minor,  who subsequently  obtained the  packages and\n\ndelivered the firearms contained therein to appellant.\n\n            The PSR  reiterated the terms of  the plea agreement,\n\nincluding that \"the government will . . . inform the court at the\n\ntime of  sentencing regarding the  extent and nature  of whatever\n\ncooperation is provided by the defendant.\"  The probation officer\n\nrecommended a base offense level (BOL)  of 12, to be increased by\n\n                              - 4 -\n                                4\n\n1 level because the offense involved more than two, but less than\n\nfive, firearms.  The PSR further recommended an upward adjustment\n\nin the BOL of two levels  for appellant's role in the offense and\n\na  downward  adjustment  of  two  levels  for  his  acceptance of\n\nresponsibility.   Based upon the recommended  total offense level\n\nof 13 and a criminal history category of I, the probation officer\n\narrived at a guideline imprisonment range of 12 to 18 months.\n\n            In discussing factors  that may warrant a  departure,\n\nthe PSR advised as follows:\n\n            A downward departure may be considered by\n            the Court based  on the cooperation which\n            the  defendant  has  afforded  government\n            authorities.      According   to   Postal\n            Inspector  J.R. Cottes,  as  a result  of\n            information  provided  by the  defendant,\n            accomplice  Jacques  Orsini-Martinez,   a\n            minor,  was   arrested  and  successfully\n            prosecuted by state authorities.\n\nThe  PSR also  noted that  appellant had  been arrested  by local\n\nauthorities and charged with unlawful sale and illegal possession\n\nof  a firearm,  arising  out of  the  same facts  underlying  the\n\nfederal indictment.  Trial was at that time pending in the Puerto\n\nRico Superior Court.\n\n            At  the sentencing  hearing on  October 7,  1992, the\n\ncourt  began by  asking appellant  if he had  anything to  say in\n\nmitigation  of  punishment.    Appellant  (through  his  counsel)\n\nresponded  by  stating  that  he   had  been  informed  that  the\n\ngovernment would  not move for  a downward departure  pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G.   5K1.1.    Appellant  objected  that  he  had  provided\n\n                              - 5 -\n                                5\n\nsubstantial assistance to the government, resulting in successful\n\nprosecution in the Puerto Rico courts of a minor who was involved\n\nin  the  offense   with  him.    Appellant   contended  that  the\n\ngovernment's failure to make a  5K1.1 motion constituted a breach\n\nof the plea agreement.\n\n            The  court  asked  the   government  to  respond  and\n\nspecifically  asked,  pursuant  to  the  plea  agreement,  to  be\n\ninformed  about  the  defendant's  cooperation.   The  government\n\nstated that at the time the plea agreement  was entered, the type\n\nof cooperation expected from  appellant was the surrender  of the\n\ntwo missing firearms or the identification of the persons to whom\n\nthey'd  been   delivered.  This  cooperation  was  not  received.\n\nAppellant  neither  delivered  the  guns to  the  government  nor\n\nidentified the persons to whom he had delivered them.\n\n            Appellant   then   argued   that  he   had   provided\n\ncooperation in  locating the  missing weapons  by meeting with  a\n\nspecial agent  of  the federal  Bureau  of Alcohol,  Tobacco  and\n\nFirearms and telling  him to whom he had given  the firearms.  In\n\naddition, he had met  with one of the  recipients of the  missing\n\nfirearms.  That person was murdered on the day after the meeting,\n\ndefeating appellant's  plans to retrieve the  firearm.  Appellant\n\nattempted, also  unsuccessfully, to  locate the recipient  of the\n\nother missing  weapon.   In view  of this  cooperation, appellant\n\nargued  that  the  government's  refusal  to  move  for a   5K1.1\n\ndeparture was arbitrary and capricious.\n\n                              - 6 -\n                                6\n\n            The district court  ruled that  in the  absence of  a\n\nmotion  by the  government, and  without  any evidence  that \"the\n\ngovernment is  lying or  is not  telling the  truth or  is hiding\n\nevidence,\" it was without authority to depart from the guidelines\n\npursuant to  U.S.S.G.  5K1.1.   The court sentenced  appellant to\n\ntwelve  months'   imprisonment  on  each  count,   to  be  served\n\nconcurrently.    The  sentencing  judge  explained  that  he  was\n\nimposing  a  sentence  at the  low  end  of  the guideline  range\n\n\"because  of  [appellant's]  youth  and  the  fact  that  he  has\n\ncooperated  in a way,  not too much  but in a way  with the local\n\ngovernment, but it is not enough for a departure under Section 5K\n\nof the guidelines.\"\n\n            On  October 13,  1992,  appellant filed  a notice  of\n\nappeal  (Appeal No. 92-2224).  The next day, appellant filed with\n\nthe  district  court  a  motion  to  correct  or reduce  sentence\n\npursuant  to Fed.  R.  Crim. P.  35(c).   Appellant  requested  a\n\nhearing on the issue of the government's breach of its obligation\n\nunder  the plea agreement to  move for a  downward departure from\n\nthe guidelines pursuant to U.S.S.G.  5K1.1.   This court remanded\n\nto the district court for a ruling on the Rule 35(c) motion.\n\n            The district court held a hearing on appellant's Rule\n\n35(c) motion on January 28, 1993.  The court ruled  that the plea\n\nagreement  did not provide that  the government would  move for a\n\nreduction pursuant to U.S.S.G.   5K1.1.  Appellant protested that\n\nit  was his understanding when he entered the plea agreement that\n\n                              - 7 -\n                                7\n\n\"the Government would advise [the court] as to what he cooperated\n\n. . . so that [the court] could make the downward departure under\n\n5K.\"  The district court, citing  the \"zipper clause\" in the plea\n\nagreement, providing  that no  additional promises would  be made\n\nunless  in writing  and signed  by both  parties, ruled  that the\n\ngovernment was  only obliged to  advise the court  of appellant's\n\ncooperation, but not  to move for a  5K1.1  reduction.  The court\n\nfound that the government had met its obligation:\n\n            They  complied with  that  part of  their\n            agreement,  and I remember  they told the\n            court what has happened with the weapons.\n            So  they  did  comply  by  informing  the\n            court.\n\nTherefore,  the district  court  denied  appellant's  Rule  35(c)\n\nmotion.  Appellant filed this appeal.\n\n                            Discussion\n                                      \n\n            Breach of Plea Agreement\n                                    \n\n            Regardless whether we apply a clearly erroneous or de\n\nnovo  standard of  review to  the district  court's determination\n\nthat the plea agreement  was not violated, compare United  States\n                                                                 \n\nv.

The district court\n\nfound that  the plea agreement  did not include a  promise by the\n\ngovernment to  move  for  a  reduction of  sentence  pursuant  to\n\n 5K1.1.  That  finding is fully  supported by the  record.    The\n\n                              - 8 -\n                                8\n\nplea  agreement makes no mention  of  5K1.1.   Nor does appellant\n\ncontend that any other written or oral agreement was entered.   \n\n            Appellant merely  contends that he  inferred from the\n\ngovernment's promise to inform the court of his cooperation  that\n\nit would also  move for a  5K1.1  departure.  The  plea agreement\n\nspecified,  however,  that  the   government  had  not  made  any\n\nadditional  promises and  that \"none  will be  entered  unless in\n\nwriting and signed by  all parties.\"  At the guilty plea hearing,\n\nappellant  specifically acknowledged  that  \"everything that  was\n\npromised [him] is  included, is inserted  in this document  which\n\nmeans that anything else which  is not here does not exist  or is\n\nnot binding upon the government or upon [him].\"\n\n            Although appellant's reasonable understanding  of the\n\ngovernment's  obligations  under  the plea  agreement  should  be\n\nenforced, in this case a promise to move for a departure under \n\n 5K1.1 could not  reasonably be implied from the plea agreement's\n\npromise  to  inform  the  court  of  the  extent  of  appellant's\n\ncooperation.

Rather,  appellant's   complaint  is  that   the\n\ngovernment  refused to file a   5K1.1 motion.   As the government\n\nnever  promised to make a   5K1.l motion, the  government did not\n\nviolate the  plea  agreement by  failing  to request  a  downward\n\ndeparture.\n\n            Section 5K1.1 Departure\n                                   \n\n            Appellant    argues    that   the    district   court\n\nmisinterpreted U.S.S.G  5K1.1 as requiring a government motion as\n\na  prerequisite to  a downward  departure based  upon appellant's\n\nsubstantial assistance.    We disagree.   Section 5K1.1 provides,\n\nin relevant part, as follows:\n\n            Upon  motion  of  the government  stating\n            that    the   defendant    has   provided\n            substantial     assistance     in     the\n            investigation  or prosecution  of another\n            person who has  committed an offense, the\n            court may depart from the guidelines.\n\nU.S.S.G   5K1.1.

As  in Wade,  however, appellant's  only support\n                            \n\nfor his position  was the  extent of cooperation  provided.   The\n\nCourt in  Wade held that  \"[t]his of course, was  not enough, for\n              \n\nalthough  a showing  of assistance is  a necessary  condition for\n\nrelief,  it is not  a sufficient one.\"   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583334\"><a href=\"/opinion/583334/united-states-v-thomas-p-atwood/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>   Similarly, in </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">this\n                                           \n\ncase,   even    assuming   that   appellant's    assistance   was\n\n\"substantial,\"  he is  not entitled  to relief.

The government's\n\nfailure  to move for a departure for this reason is not arbitrary\n\nor capricious.   The district  court did not  err in  determining\n\nthat it had no  authority to grant a downward  departure pursuant\n\nto U.S.S.G.  5K1.1 absent a motion from the government.\n\n            Appellant's conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n                                                            \n\n                              - 11 -\n                                11\n</pre>",
