John  Pappalardo, United States  Attorney, and Andrew  Levchuk,\n                                                                 \nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per Curiam.  Appellant Joseph F. Druan appeals from\n                    \n\nthe denial of his  petition for habeas corpus filed  under 28\n\nU.S.C.    2255.  After carefully reviewing the record and the\n\nparties' briefs, we affirm the judgment of the district court\n\nfor essentially the reasons stated in its Order dated January\n\n5, 1993.  We add to that decision the following comments.\n\n          The district  court properly disposed of  this case\n\nwithout a hearing.  \"An  evidentiary hearing is not  required\n\nwhere  the section 2255  petition, any accompanying exhibits,\n\nand  the record  evidence `plainly  [reveal] .  . .  that the\n\nmovant is not entitled to relief. . . . '\"  Barrett v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates, 965  F.2d 1184,  1186 (1st  Cir. 1992)  (quoting Rule\n      \n\n4(b), Rules  Governing Section  2255 Proceedings).   That is,\n\nsummary dismissal is appropriate where the grounds for relief\n\nare not cognizable under   2255 or are merely bald assertions\n\nwithout specific and particular factual allegations.  Id.  We\n                                                         \n\nagree with the district court that the petition was deficient\n\nin both regards.\n\n          Further, Druan did not submit any valid reasons why\n\nhe  now should be  relieved of the statements  he made in his\n\nchange-of-plea hearing.  See  Ouellette v. United States, 862\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 371, 374 (1st Cir. 1988).  His claims in this regard are\n\nbased  on  facts with  which  the  district court  judge  was\n\nfamiliar  because he  had presided  at both  the Rule  11 and\n\nsentencing hearings.    As  such, he  was  entitled  to  make\n\nfindings  without  an  additional  hearing and  we  will  not\n\noverturn his findings  absent clear error.  See  Barrett, 965\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  at 1186;  Panzardi-Alvarez v.  United States,  879 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n975, 985 n.8  (1st Cir.  1989), cert. denied,  493 U.S.  1082\n                                            \n\n(1990).   Under this standard  of review, the  district court\n\njudge's findings  that Druan's guilty plea  was voluntary and\n\nthat his counsel provided  effective assistance are more than\n\nadequately supported by the record.\n\n          As  for Druan's  attempt to  argue that his    2255\n\npetition  raised a  jurisdictional  issue because  no  \"overt\n\nacts\" had occurred in Massachusetts, we note only that at the\n\nchange-of-plea hearing the government  plainly set forth  the\n\nfact that the videotape, made in Connecticut, was transported\n\nto  Massachusetts.    Druan, at  this  hearing,  specifically\n\nagreed with this description of the facts.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                        \n\n                             -3-\n",
