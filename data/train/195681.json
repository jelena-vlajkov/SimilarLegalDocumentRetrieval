Several transitory employees filed the\n                    \n\npresent     1983 action  claiming  their  contracts were  not\n\nrenewed for  politically discriminatory reasons  in violation\n\nof  their First  Amendment rights.   Contending that  Orta v.\n                                                             \n\nPadilla  Ayala,  92  JTS  96  (1992),  established  that  the\n              \n\ncontracts of transitory employees properly may not be renewed\n\neven for politically discriminatory reasons without violating\n\nany law,  defendants moved for summary  judgment on qualified\n\nimmunity  grounds.  The  district court  rejected defendants'\n\nreading of the Orta decision and,  citing Cheveras Pacheco v.\n                                                             \n\nRivera Gonzalez,  809 F.2d  125 (1st Cir.  1987), where  this\n               \n\ncourt, in rejecting a  qualified immunity defense,  concluded\n\nthat a transitory employee  was protected within the confines\n\nof the  Branti-Elrod line of  cases from a  politically based\n                    \n\nnon-renewal, denied defendants'  motion for summary judgment.\n\nDefendants have now appealed.  \n\n          It is important to  note that, unlike the situation\n\nin Orta, the plaintiffs have not asserted any property rights\n       \n\nin  their transitory  positions.   Rather, their  position is\n\nthat even if they have no property interest under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw  in continued  employment after  the expiration  of their\n\ncontracts, nevertheless defendants  may not  constitutionally\n\nrefuse to  renew  their transitory  appointments  because  of\n\nplaintiffs'    political    affiliation   unless    political\n\naffiliation is  an appropriate job requirement.    Plaintiffs\n\n                             -2-\n\nare correct for the reasons we  explained in Cheveras Pacheco\n                                                             \n\nv. Rivera Gonzalez, 809 F.2d 125, 127-28 (1st Cir. 1987).  As\n                  \n\nthe  Otra  decision  did  not  expressly  address  any  First\n         \n\nAmendment claim  under the Elrod-Branti line of  cases, we do\n                                       \n\nnot  agree with defendants' reading of that decision.  In any\n\nevent,  however,  federal  law governs  whether  an  employee\n\nenjoys First  Amendment protection  from a  politically based\n\nadverse  employment  action.   See Mariani-Giron  v. Acevedo-\n                                                             \n\nRuiz, 877 F.2d  1114, 1119  n. 7 (1st  Cir. 1989);  Santiago-\n                                                             \n\nNegron v.
