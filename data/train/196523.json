We  have   carefully  reviewed  the\r                                 \r\n\ndistrict court record and  the briefs of the parties,  and we\r\n\naffirm the judgment of the district court for essentially the\r\n\nreasons set forth in the Order dated June 1, 1995.\r\n\n          Our decision is  not a reflection on  the merits of\r\n\nappellant's entitlement to the  Congressional Medal of Honor.\r\n\nThe record in this case evidences Mr. Cadigan's extraordinary\r\n\ncourage and service to his country, service which most likely\r\n\nsaved the lives of two platoons of American troops in Germany\r\n\nin  1945.   Simply, as  the district court  found, it  had no\r\n\npower  to  review   the  decision  of  the  Army   Board  for\r\n\nCorrections  of  Military  Records; the  question  before the\r\n\ncourt  was  not  whether  it  had  jurisdiction  to  consider\r                                                           \r\n\nappellant's  case, but  whether  the  question presented  was\r\n\njusticiable.\r                       \r\n\n          Appellant does not complain that the Army failed to\r\n\nfollow  a   mandate  contained  in  a   relevant  statute  or\r\n\nregulation, committed an unauthorized  act, or made a factual\r\n\nerror  which rises to the level of  an injustice -- the kinds\r\n\nof claims  which  usually are  justiciable.   See  Dodson  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nUnited  States, 988 F.2d 1199,  1204 &amp; n.6  (Fed. Cir. 1993).\r                          \r\n\nRather, appellant asserts that, under the facts he presented,\r\n\nthe  Army  should  have  awarded  him  the  Medal  of  Honor.\r\n\nHowever, the decision whether to award a medal is one left to\r\n\nthe complete discretion  of the military.   Wilson v.  United\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nStates,  24 Cl. Ct. 842, 846  (1992) (the decision by the Air\r                  \r\n\nForce to award one  medal to plaintiff instead of  another is\r\n\n\"purely a  discretionary one and therefore  is not reviewable\r\n\nby [a] court\").  Indeed, the criteria for such awards are not\r\n\nwithin the realm of  judicial expertise, implicating  instead\r\n\nthe \"complex, subtle, and professional decisions\" left by the\r\n\nConstitution  to the judgment of  the military.  See Gilligan\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Morgan, 413 U.S.  1, 10 (1973).  The cases appellant cites\r                     \r\n\nare not to the contrary as they involved justiciable matters.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Swann v. Garrett, 811 F.Supp. 1336 (N.D.Ind. 1992)\r                                       \r\n\n(review of  the factual  question whether plaintiff  had been\r                                   \r\n\nawarded the Navy Cross).\r\n\n          Because this  case does  not present  a substantial\r\n\nquestion, the appeal  is summarily affirmed.
