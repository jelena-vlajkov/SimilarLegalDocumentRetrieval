Duensing,\r                                                                             \nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n     Per  Curiam.     Plaintiff-appellant William  J. Riordan\r                            \n\nappeals  from a  judgment  which dismissed  his civil  rights\n\ncomplaint on  the ground that the  defendant, a Massachusetts\n\nSuperior  Court  clerk/magistrate, was  entitled  to immunity\n\nfrom  suit.   We affirm  the dismissal  without reaching  the\n\nimmunity issue.\n\n          Plaintiff pleaded  guilty in  state court  to armed\n\nrobbery  and related  crimes.   Following his  conviction and\n\nsentence,  he filed a pro  se motion seeking  to withdraw his\r                                         \n\nguilty plea and a motion for the appointment of counsel.  The\n\nstate court allowed the motion for the appointment of counsel\n\nand referred it to the  Committee for Public Services Counsel\n\n[\"CPSC\"] on June  8, 1994.   The court's  order included  the\n\nfollowing  language:  \"No  further action  until  counsel  is\n\nappointed.\"   On July 28,  1994, plaintiff attempted  to file\n\nthree  more  pro se  motions  seeking, inter  alia,  an early\r                                                              \n\nevidentiary hearing  on  his motion  to change  his plea  and\n\npermission to  waive the  appointment of  counsel  due to  an\n\nanticipated  delay by  CPSC.   On August  9, 1994,  the clerk\n\nnotified  plaintiff  that  the   new  motions  would  not  be\n\nprocessed  because   they  were  not  filed   by  plaintiff's\n\nattorney.  The rejection letter acknowledged that no attorney\n\nhad yet  been assigned  to represent plaintiff,  and referred\n\nhim to CPSC for further information.\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          A few days later, plaintiff filed this complaint in\n\nfederal  district  court  alleging  that  the  state  clerk's\n\nrefusal  to accept  his pro  se motions  deprived him  of his\r                                           \n\nconstitutional right of access to the courts in violation  of\n\nthe First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, the Massachusetts\n\nDeclaration of  Rights, and state  law.   He sought  damages,\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive  relief.  We are informed that the\n\nclaims  for equitable relief are moot. The clerk named in the\n\ncomplaint  has resigned,  and a  new court clerk  has advised\n\nplaintiff that his pro se pleadings  will be accepted pending\r                                     \n\nan appointment of counsel.\n\n          As  to the damages claims,  it may well  be, as the\n\ndistrict court held, that the complaint is infirm because  it\n\nchallenges   conduct   protected  by   defendant's  qualified\n\nimmunity.  See Lowinger v. Broderick, Dkt. 94-1077,  slip op.\r                                                \n\nat 7-8 (1st  Cir. Mar. 22, 1995).  And, as defendant asserts,\n\nany damages claims against the clerk in his official capacity\n\nwould be  barred by the Eleventh  Amendment, which proscribes\n\nsuits against state officials  which must be paid  from state\n\nfunds.   Hafer v.  Melo, 502 U.S.  21, 26-28  (1991); Will v.\r                                                                      \n\nMichigan  Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 65 (1989).  But\r                                           \n\nwe  think it  unnecessary to reach  these issues  because the\n\ncomplaint obviously is infirm for  another reason:  there are\n\nno  facts indicating  that  the remedies  available from  the\n\nState were inadequate. \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          It   is   well  established   that   an  official's\n\nunauthorized conduct which cannot be foreseen  and controlled\n\nin advance does not constitute a violation of the Due Process\n\nClause  \"until and  unless [the State]  refuses to  provide a\n\nsuitable postdeprivation remedy.\"  Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S.\r                                                               \n\n517, 533 (1984);  see also  Parratt v. Taylor,  451 U.S.  527\r                                                         \n\n(1981);  Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 125 (1990); Lowe v.\r                                                                      \n\nScott, 959 F.2d 323,  340 (1st Cir. 1992).   Since inadequacy\r                 \n\nof  the state's remedy  is a material  element of  the   1983\n\nclaim, plaintiff  had the burden of  setting forth supporting\n\nfactual allegations, either direct or inferential, to sustain\n\nan actionable legal theory.   Gooley v. Mobil Oil  Corp., 851\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d 513,  515 (1st Cir. 1988).  \n\n          Plaintiff's complaint  does  not allege  any  facts\n\nshowing an  absence of state  process to  remedy the  alleged\n\ndeprivation.  The Massachusetts courts in fact provide such a\n\nremedy.   See  Bolton v.  Commonwealth, 407  Mass. 1003,  552\r                                                  \n\nN.E.2d  83  (1990)  (explaining  that remedy  for  a  clerk's\n\nwrongful refusal to accept  papers is by motion to  the court\n\nand failing that, by petition  for a writ of mandamus to  the\n\nSupreme Judicial Court); Burnham v.  Clerk of the First Dist.\r                                                                         \n\nCourt,  352  Mass. 466,  226 N.E.2d  190  (1967) (same).   By\r                 \n\ninstead  seeking redress  through  a    1983 suit,  plaintiff\n\ninvites   collateral  federal   supervision   of  the   state\n\nproceedings.   Lower federal courts lack  jurisdiction to sit\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nin review of state  court proceedings.  District  of Columbia\r                                                                         \n\nCourt of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 476 (1983); Rooker\r                                                                         \n\nv.

Plaintiff's remaining\r               \n\narguments are frivolous.\n\n          Accordingly, the judgment dismissing  the complaint\n\nfor failure to state a claim is affirmed.  See Acha v. United\r                                                                         \n\nStates,  910 F.2d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 1990) (affirmance may rest\r                  \n\non any ground presented by the record).\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",

Since inadequacy of the state's remedy is a material element of the Sec. 1983 claim, plaintiff had the burden of setting forth supporting factual allegations, either direct or inferential, to sustain an actionable legal theory.  Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508719\"><a href=\"/opinion/508719/william-r-gooley-v-mobil-oil-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span>, 515 (1st Cir. 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's complaint does not allege any facts showing an absence of state process to remedy the alleged deprivation.  The Massachusetts courts in fact provide such a remedy.  See Bolton v. Commonwealth, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1003</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span> </span>(1990) (explaining that remedy for a clerk's wrongful refusal to accept papers is by motion to the court and failing that, by petition for a writ of mandamus to the Supreme Judicial Court);  Burnham v. Clerk of the First Dist. Court, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span> </span>(1967) (same).  By instead seeking redress through a Sec. 1983 suit, plaintiff invites collateral federal supervision of the state proceedings.  Lower federal courts lack jurisdiction to sit in review of state court proceedings.  District of Columbia Court of Appeals v.
