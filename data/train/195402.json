Plaintiffs  in this  case\n                                   \n\nappeal the denial  of their motion for  a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe district court denied  the injunction on the ground  that the\n\nplaintiffs failed to show  a likelihood of success on  the merits\n\nof  their underlying claims.   See  Narragansett Indian  Tribe v.\n                                                              \n\nGuilbert, 934 F.2d 4, 5 (1st  Cir. 1991).  We review the district\n        \n\ncourt's denial of the preliminary injunction \"'under a relatively\n\ndeferential  glass,'\" and will disturb  such a ruling  only if we\n\nfind the  court made  a  manifest mistake  of law  or abused  its\n\ndiscretion.   Id. (quoting  Independent  Oil &amp;  Chem. Workers  of\n                                                                 \n\nQuincy, Inc. v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co., 864 F.2d 927, 929 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir. 1988)).\n\n          After  reviewing  the  record  in  this  case  and  the\n\narguments  in the briefs, we conclude that the district court did\n\nnot  abuse its discretion or make any manifest errors of law when\n\nit  found that plaintiffs had failed to establish a likelihood of\n\nsuccess  on  the  merits  of  their  claims  under  the  National\n\nEnvironmental  Policy  Act  (\"NEPA\"),  42  U.S.C.      4321-4347;\n\nSection 404 of the Clean Water  Act (\"CWA\"), 33 U.S.C.   1344(a);\n\nSection 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act (\"DOTA\"), 49\n\nU.S.C.   303(c); and Section 176 of the Clean Air Act (\"CAA\"), 42\n\nU.S.C.     7506(c).   We  therefore affirm  the  district court's\n\ndenial of plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\n          Because  the   district  court's  opinion   presents  a\n\nthorough  and accurate discussion of  the facts of  this case, we\n\nfind  it  appropriate to  incorporate  that  discussion into  our\n\n                               -3-\n\ndecision.\n\n                               -4-\n\n                         I.  Introduction\n\n               This   litigation   stems   from   the\n            proposed  construction  of the  Jamestown\n            Connector,    a    four-lane,    divided,\n            controlled  access   highway  across  the\n            island of Jamestown,  Rhode Island  which\n            will  connect   the  Jamestown-Verrazzano\n            Bridge  and  the  Pell (Newport)  Bridge.\n            Jamestown Island, lies  in the middle  of\n            Narragansett Bay in what is known by some\n            as the Route  138 corridor, a forty  (40)\n            mile  stretch of roadways running from I-\n            95 in Richmond, Rhode Island to  I-195 in\n            Swansea,  Massachusetts.   The plaintiffs\n            are   the  Conservation   Law  Foundation\n            (\"CLF\"), Audubon Society of Rhode Island,\n            Clean  Water   Action,  Concerned  Island\n            Residents,   DOT   Watch,   Environmental\n            Council  of Rhode  Island, Save  the Bay,\n            Sierra Club, South Kingstown Neighborhood\n            Congress,  and   West  Side  Association.\n            Plaintiffs  filed  two separate  actions,\n            which have been consolidated,  seeking to\n            enjoin  construction   of  the  Jamestown\n            Connector.    The   defendants  are   the\n            Federal Highway  Administration (\"FHWA\"),\n            Gordon  G. Hoxie in his official capacity\n            as Division Administrator  for the  Rhode\n            Island  Division  of the  Federal Highway\n            Administration, Arthur E. Williams in his\n            official capacity as  Chief of  Engineers\n            of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\"the\n            Corps\"),  Dante  E.  Boffi,  Jr.  in  his\n            official  capacity  as  Director  of  the\n            Rhode Island Department of Transportation\n            (\"RIDOT\"),    and   the  State   Planning\n            Council.    In  total, plaintiffs  allege\n            violations of five federal statutes:  the\n            National    Environmental    Policy   Act\n            (\"NEPA\"),    the    Intermodal    Surface\n            Transportation Efficiency  Act \"(ISTEA\"),\n            the   Clean   Water   Act  (\"CWA\"),   the\n            Department of Transportation Act (\"DOT\"),\n            and the Clean Air Act (\"CAA\").\n\n                     II.  Factual Background\n\n               The  history  of this  highway project\n            dates back to proposed Interstate Highway\n            895  (\"I-895\"),  which received  original\n            approval in December 1969  as part of the\n\n                               -5-\n\n            Interstate  and  Defense Highway  System.\n            The  original  proposed  12.1 mile  route\n            spanned Narragansett  Bay between Warwick\n            and Barrington, Rhode  Island.  In  1974,\n            FHWA  approved  a  RIDOT  proposal  which\n            recommended  a  substitute  route.    The\n            proposed  substitute  I-895   essentially\n            tracked Route 138,  an undivided  roadway\n            dating  from the early  1920's, from I-95\n            in  Richmond,  Rhode Island  to  I-195 in\n            either    Swansea    or    Fall    River,\n            Massachusetts.   Route  138 is  the  only\n            road crossing Narragansett  Bay south  of\n            Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n               In November 1975,  RIDOT initiated  an\n            Environmental  Impact  Statement/Corridor\n            Location Study for designated I-895.   In\n            April  1979,  RIDOT  published the  I-895\n            Draft   Environmental  Impact   Statement\n            (\"DEIS\").  The 1979 DEIS  recognized that\n            Route   138   \"was   not    intended   to\n            accommodate   the   types  of   vehicles,\n            prevailing  operating   speeds,  and  the\n            volumes of traffic\" that it then carried.\n            Following  the  publication of  the DEIS,\n            community  comment  was received  at four\n            public  hearings.   On February  5, 1982,\n            the  State  of  Rhode   Island  requested\n            withdrawal  of  proposed  I-895 from  the\n            Interstate Highway System.   On  December\n            30,  1982,  FHWA approved  Rhode Island's\n            withdrawal request because I-895  was not\n            \"essential to the completion of a unified\n            and    connected   Interstate    System.\"\n            (Fed.Def.Exh. 6)  Much of the proposed I-\n            895 corridor,  however, remained eligible\n            for   federal    funds   for   substitute\n            projects.\n\n               The  1979  DEIS  contained a  separate\n            section addressing the construction  of a\n            Jamestown  Bridge  replacement structure.\n            Because  of its  functional obsolescence,\n            increases     in     traffic     volumes,\n            skyrocketing  maintenance  costs and  the\n            need for a  completely new concrete deck,\n            RIDOT determined that  the existing  two-\n            lane Jamestown Bridge needed replacement.\n            The  Surface  Transportation Act  of 1978\n            specifically    allocated   discretionary\n            funding   under    the   Highway   Bridge\n\n                               -6-\n\n            Replacement  Program   to  implement  the\n            Jamestown Bridge replacement project.  As\n            a result, FHWA authorized the development\n            of   a  site-specific   Jamestown  Bridge\n            Environmental Impact Statement (\"JBEIS\").\n            The   JBEIS,   completed  in   May  1989,\n            proposed  a four-lane  replacement bridge\n            adjacent to the existing bridge and four-\n            lane access roadways extending from Route\n            1A in  North Kingstown to Helm  Street on\n            Jamestown.\n\n               Following the decision to  withdraw I-\n            895, RIDOT continued  to examine the need\n            for improvements throughout the Route 138\n            Corridor.  RIDOT's analysis culminated in\n            1984  with   the  issuance  of   a  Final\n            Environmental  Impact Statement  (\"FEIS\")\n            for the corridor.  FHWA approved the FEIS\n            on  September 27,  1984.   The  1984 FEIS\n            study   area    encompassed   Washington,\n            Newport,  and  Bristol Counties  in Rhode\n            Island,     as    well     as    Swansea,\n            Massachusetts.  In Washington County, the\n            FEIS  proposed a  mixture of  upgrades to\n            certain existing portions of Route 138, a\n            no-build  option  for  other portions  of\n            Route  138,  and   construction  of   new\n            roadways in other  areas of the corridor.\n            On Jamestown Island, the FEIS  proposed a\n            four-lane   reconstruction   along    the\n            available right  of way on  Eldred Avenue\n            (1.1  miles)  and two  possible four-lane\n            alternatives  for  East  Shore Road  (1.1\n            miles).   The FEIS   recognized  that the\n            Jamestown    Design    Study    Committee\n            (\"JDSC\"),  which  had   been  formed   in\n            February  of  1983,  was considering  the\n            entire   connector  roadway   system  for\n            Jamestown Island.  Accordingly,  the FEIS\n            contemplated draft and final supplemental\n            EIS documents for  the project  following\n            decisions   by  JDSC   and  RIDOT.     On\n            Aquidneck    Island,   the    1984   FEIS\n            recognized the need for  improvements but\n            proposed   a  no-build   alternative  and\n            recommended  further  studies.   Finally,\n            the  FEIS proposed a  no-build option for\n            the East Shore portion of the  study area\n            including  Bristol  County, Rhode  Island\n            and Swansea, Massachusetts.\n\n                               -7-\n\n               Following  the  1984  FEIS,  the  JDSC\n            convened  numerous   public  meetings  on\n            Jamestown    and   collected    community\n            reaction  to  the  proposed  cross-island\n            roadway.  Based upon community input, the\n            JDSC  recommended  a  conceptual plan  to\n            RIDOT  in June  1984 which,  with certain\n            refinements, became  known as Alternative\n            B.   Alternative B  proposed a controlled\n            access  four-lane roadway  extending from\n            the  Jamestown-Verrazzano   Bridge  along\n            Eldred Avenue with  interchanges at  Helm\n            Street and  North Road and flowing into a\n            new  four-lane  roadway  located west  of\n            East Shore Road extending to  the Newport\n            Bridge.\n\n               Based  on the  JDSC's recommendations,\n            RIDOT  completed   a  draft  supplemental\n            environmental impact  statement (\"DSEIS\")\n            in April  1986.   The  FHWA approved  the\n            DSEIS  on  April  22, 1986.    The  DSEIS\n            considered six alternatives for  a cross-\n            island roadway on Jamestown:   a No-Build\n            Alternative,  the  Transportation Systems\n            Management   (\"TSM\")   Alternative,   two\n            unlimited access roadways (Alternatives A\n            and  A1), and two limited access roadways\n            (Alternatives  B  and   C).    The  DSEIS\n            identified  Alternative  B, now  known as\n            the   \"Jamestown   Connector\",   as   the\n            preferred alternative.   RIDOT circulated\n            the  DSEIS on  May  23, 1986  and held  a\n            public    hearing   at    the   Jamestown\n            Elementary School on June 26, 1986.\n\n               Following the submission of the DSEIS,\n            RIDOT  began  pursuing necessary  permits\n            for  Alternative B from  the Rhode Island\n            Department  of  Environmental  Management\n            (\"RIDEM\").  Pursuant to provisions of the\n            Administrative  Procedure  Act and  Rhode\n            Island's   Freshwater  Wetlands   Act,  a\n            wetland  public  hearing   was  held   on\n            February  10,  1987  to   resolve  issues\n            pertaining   to   wetland   impacts   and\n            Alternative  B.   Following  the hearing,\n            RIDOT   and   RIDEM   signed  a   consent\n            agreement which modified Alternative B to\n            minimize  wetlands  impact.    The  RIDEM\n            Wetlands    Public     Hearing    Officer\n            incorporated   the   conditions  of   the\n\n                               -8-\n\n            consent agreement into  the final  design\n            and  order rendered  on  April 30,  1987.\n            The  order  specified conditional  permit\n            approval to alter freshwater wetlands.\n\n               RIDOT  completed a  final supplemental\n            environmental impact statement  (\"FSEIS\")\n            for the Jamestown  Connector in July 1987\n            and   FHWA   approved   the    FSEIS   on\n            December 18, 1987.   The FSEIS  responded\n            to  comments received  on the  1986 DSEIS\n            and  investigated  the  same  six  design\n            alternatives,  with  some  modifications,\n            considered by the  1986 DSEIS.  According\n            to the FSEIS, traffic safety and drainage\n            concerns     rendered     the    No-Build\n            Alternative and the  TSM Alternative  not\n            viable.    The  unlimited access  upgrade\n            alternatives,   A   and  A1,   failed  to\n            separate   local  and   through  traffic,\n            failed  to  maintain highway  continuity,\n            permitted continued development along the\n            alignment frontage, and allowed  for high\n            traffic    volumes,     congestion    and\n            increasing accident rates.  Alternative C\n            affected  the  greatest  acreage  in  the\n            Windmill   Hill  Historic   District  and\n            failed to attract support  from Jamestown\n            residents  because  of undesirable  local\n            access    designs.       Alternative   B,\n            meanwhile, provided the greatest benefits\n            while minimizing adverse  impacts to  the\n            residents  and   surrounding  environment\n            according to the FSEIS.  As a result, the\n            FSEIS  identified  Alternative  B as  the\n            preferred alternative.  On May  27, 1988,\n            FHWA  issued a Record of Decision (\"ROD\")\n            on the FSEIS which expressly ratified the\n            selection  of  Alternative B  for further\n            project development.\n\n               The 1987 FSEIS also  found Alternative\n            B to be consistent with six other planned\n            and committed highway projects within the\n            Route 138 Corridor:   the I-95 to Route 2\n            upgrade; the relocation of Route 138 from\n            Route 2 to U.S. 1;  the reconstruction of\n            Route 138  from U.S.  1 to the  Jamestown\n            Bridge; the Jamestown Bridge Replacement;\n            the Newport Circulator  Project; and  the\n            Route 138 upgrading along East  Main Road\n            from  Route   24  to  Route  113.     The\n\n                               -9-\n\n            cumulative   impacts   of  the   projects\n            located   in    Washington   County   and\n            Jamestown   (all   projects  except   the\n            Newport Circulator and the East Main Road\n            upgrade) had been previously  analyzed in\n            the  corridor-wide  1979  DEIS  and  1984\n            FEIS.\n\n               RIDOT  proposed reconstruction  of the\n            two-lane roadway from I-95  to Route 2 in\n            three phases.  Phase one was completed in\n            1981 and the other  two phases are in the\n            preliminary   design    stage.      RIDOT\n            reevaluated the FEIS  for the  relocation\n            of  Route 138 from  Route 2 to  U.S. 1 in\n            February 1991 and  modified the  original\n            alignment.   The roadway from Route  1 to\n            the  Jamestown  Bridge,  approved in  the\n            1981 JBEIS, was constructed  during 1992.\n            The   new   Jamestown-Verrazzano   Bridge\n            replaced the Jamestown Bridge  and opened\n            to  traffic on  October  19,  1992.   The\n            Newport   Circulator  Project   has  been\n            replaced   by   a   series    of   lesser\n            improvements  expected  to  be  forwarded\n            with  a  request  for  a  Finding  of  No\n            Significant  Impact  (\"FONSI\") in  Summer\n            1993.      Finally,  the   FHWA  approved\n            improvements to the  four-lane East  Main\n            Road  on December 24,  1991 and selection\n            of a consultant to  begin final design is\n            underway.\n\n               The 1987 FSEIS  also examined  impacts\n            to   parklands  and   historic  resources\n            governed   by   Section   4(f)   of   the\n            Department of  Transportation Act (\"DOT\")\n            and Section 106  of the National Historic\n            Preservation   Act.     This   evaluation\n            focuses  on  the  Windmill Hill  Historic\n            District   and    examined   four   build\n            alternatives, a No-Build Alternative, and\n            an Avoidance Alternative.   Although  the\n            No-Build  Alternative  would not  impinge\n            upon  historic  resources,  it failed  to\n            meet the project goals and was determined\n            to be neither prudent nor  feasible.  All\n            four of the build  alternatives adversely\n            effected   the  Windmill   Hill  Historic\n            District.    The  FSEIS  determined  that\n            Alternatives  A  and  A1, both  four-lane\n            uncontrolled  access   roadways  with  at\n\n                               -10-\n\n            grade  intersections,  carried  far  less\n            short-term impacts  on historic resources\n            than  the  preferred alternative.   These\n            alternatives,  however,  failed  to  meet\n            traffic service and  safety concerns  and\n            permitted   the  possibility   of  future\n            development  which  could   have  a   far\n            greater long-term impact on  the historic\n            district.    The  FSEIS  determined  that\n            Alternative C, a  limited access  highway\n            on  a  different alignment,  required the\n            use  of  more  historic   resources  than\n            Alternative    B    without     providing\n            offsetting  traffic  or safety  benefits.\n            Finally,     although    an     Avoidance\n            Alternative,   designed   to  avoid   all\n            protected   Section  4(f)   resources  on\n            Jamestown Island, was feasible, the FSEIS\n            determined  that  it   was  not   prudent\n            because  of  \"a   number  of   disruptive\n            consequences  involved  in  this  or  any\n            alternative that avoids the Windmill Hill\n            Historic  District.\"   Although  it found\n            that  Alternative  A1  caused  the  least\n            impact  to  the  historic  district,  the\n            Rhode   Island  Historical   Preservation\n            Commission recognized that the separation\n            of  through  and  local traffic  achieved\n            with    Alternative     B    necessitated\n            considering this  alternative even though\n            it  had  greater short-term  Section 4(f)\n            impacts.   The  1987 FSEIS  ROD concluded\n            that there  was  no prudent  or  feasible\n            alternative to the use  of land from  the\n            Windmill   Hill  Historic   District  and\n            Alternative   B  included   all  possible\n            planning to minimize harm  resulting from\n            such use. \n\n               On June 8,  1988, FHWA authorized  the\n            acquisition  of  parcels  to establish  a\n            right-of-way  along  Eldred  Avenue  from\n            Seaside   Drive  to   North  Road.     By\n            November 7, 1990, RIDOT  had acquired  at\n            least 143 of the 202 parcels necessary to\n            build the Jamestown Connector.\n\n               In  October,  1986 RIDOT  submitted to\n            the  Corps  the  first  of  a  series  of\n            applications for a permit for the filling\n            of  wetlands  in   connection  with   the\n            Jamestown  Connector.   (Plaintiffs' Exh.\n\n                               -11-\n\n            22 and 23.)   Although the Corps issued a\n            public notice regarding its permit review\n            for    the    Jamestown   Connector    on\n            November 29, 1990, no public  hearing was\n            held  in  connection   with  the   permit\n            application.   On May 22, 1992, the Corps\n            completed  an  Environmental   Assessment\n            (\"EA\") and statement  of findings for the\n            purposes of issuing a Section  404 permit\n            to fill wetlands.  The EA \"considered all\n            factors   relevant   to  th[e]   proposal\n            including   cumulative  effects.\"     The\n            environmental     assessment    minimized\n            wetlands  impacts  by replacing  the Helm\n            Street  overpass with a  frontage road to\n            address  local access concerns.  Based on\n            the  evaluation of  environmental effects\n            discussed  in the  1987 FSEIS,  the Corps\n            determined  that  the  \"decision on  [the\n            Section  404]  application  [was]  not  a\n            major   federal    action   significantly\n            affecting  the  quality   of  the   human\n            environment\"  and  therefore required  no\n            separate environmental  impact statement.\n            The  Corps  concluded that  Alternative B\n            without the Helm  Street overpass was the\n            least       environmentally      damaging\n            practicable alternative.  As a result, on\n            May 21,  1992, the  Corps issued  a final\n            Section 404 permit  authorizing RIDOT  to\n            fill approximately 4.6 acres  of wetlands\n            to construct the Jamestown Connector.\n\n               Throughout  and  following  the  Corps\n            permit   approval   process,   the   JDSC\n            continued  to  hold periodic  meetings to\n            evaluate additional proposed  refinements\n            to the Jamestown Connector  design.  In a\n            JDSC  meeting held on May 7, 1992, Thomas\n            Todd,   an    architect   and   Jamestown\n            resident, presented an alternative design\n            featuring    an   at-grade,    signalized\n            intersection  at  the crossing  of Eldred\n            Avenue  and  North   Road.    Mr.  Todd's\n            conceptual  layout   incuded  two  travel\n            lanes in each direction and separate left\n            and right turn lanes along Eldred Avenue.\n            Minutes  of the meeting  reflect that Mr.\n            Todd  also  had  contacted the  Jamestown\n            Police and  had been informed  that there\n            had  been  213  accidents  (78  involving\n            injury)  on Route  138 in  Jamestown over\n\n                               -12-\n\n            the previous five  year period.   Records\n            at   the   Newport   Bridge  Toll   Plaza\n            indicated  that approximately  31 million\n            trips had been  made over that  same time\n            period.  At  the same  meeting, the  JDSC\n            formed an architectural review committee,\n            with Mr. Todd as a member.  Over the next\n            six  months,  RIDOT incorporated  certain\n            profile  and   architectural  adjustments\n            suggested  by  the  architectural  review\n            committee  into  the Jamestown  Connector\n            design.\n\n               FHWA   conditionally    approved   the\n            receipt   of   bids  for   the  Jamestown\n            Connector on July  31, 1992.   Plaintiffs\n            commenced this action on October 8, 1992.\n            RIDOT  opened  bids  for   the  Jamestown\n            Connector on December 11, 1992.  On April\n            21,  1993,  RIDOT  issued  a  conditional\n            notice   to  proceed   with  construction\n            activity   to   its  contractor,   Tilcon\n            Gammino.   After final notice  to proceed\n            was given, construction began on  May 13,\n            1993.   On May 21, 1993, plaintiffs moved\n            for a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\")\n            to  enjoin further construction.   On May\n            25, 1993, this court  granted plaintiffs'\n            TRO application  which restrained further\n            construction activity within the frontage\n            road area along Eldred Avenue.  The court\n            vacated   the  TRO   on  June   8,  1993.\n            Defendants   have    moved   to   dismiss\n            plaintiffs'  Clean Air Act claim for lack\n            of  jurisdiction and  failure to  state a\n            claim  upon which relief  can be granted.\n            Plaintiffs,  in  turn,  have   moved  for\n            summary judgment  on their Clean  Air Act\n            and  Intermodal   Surface  Transportation\n            Efficiency  Act  claims.   Because  these\n            motions  raise   substantially  the  same\n            issues  as  plaintiffs'  application  for\n            preliminary injunction,  the court defers\n            ruling on  them and considers  all claims\n            under    the    preliminary    injunction\n            standard.\n\nConservation Law  Found. v.

For the\n\nfollowing  reasons, we  uphold the  district court's  findings in\n\nthis case.\n\n                         A.  NEPA CLAIMS\n                                        \n\n                               -14-\n\n          1.  Logical Termini\n\n          The district  court found  that none of  the defendants\n\nviolated its respective obligations  under NEPA to prepare proper\n\nEnvironmental   Impact  Statements  (\"EISs\")  for  the  Jamestown\n\nConnector  highway project.   In  particular, the  court rejected\n\nplaintiffs' argument that the defendants unlawfully segmented the\n\ngeographic area of analysis  in the 1987 Jamestown  Connector EIS\n\n(\"Jamestown FSEIS\")  and that  defendants failed to  consider the\n\ncumulative impacts  of highway projects  all along the  Route 138\n\nCorridor.\n\n          Federal  Highway  Administration  (\"FHWA\")  regulations\n\nprovide that an EIS is of proper geographic scope if the  project\n\nit analyzes connects \"logical termini,\" has \"independent utility\"\n\nand does not restrict \"consideration of alternatives.\"  23 C.F.R.\n\n  771.111(f).    The  district  court found  that  the  Jamestown\n\nConnector project satisfied all three criteria  and, as a result,\n\nthe  1987  Jamestown FSEIS  was of  the  appropriate scope.   The\n\nplaintiffs take issue only with  the court's determination of the\n\nfirst prong (the so-called \"logical termini\" prong).\n\n          \"Termini\" include crossroads, population centers, major\n\ntraffic generators, or similar highway control elements.  37 Fed.\n\nReg. 21,810.   The district court found  that the two bridges  on\n\neach  side  of  the  Jamestown Connector  (entering  and  exiting\n\nJamestown  island)  are  logical  enough termini  to  uphold  the\n\nagencies'   determination  that  the   connector  was   a  proper\n\ngeographic area  for environmental analysis.   In particular, the\n\n                               -15-\n\ncourt accepted defendants' argument  that the bridges are traffic\n\ngenerators or traffic control devices.\n\n          Plaintiffs contend  that the bridges do  not qualify as\n\n\"crossroads\" or  \"traffic  generators,\" but  instead  are  merely\n\nindistinguishable strips of the highway that happen  to pass over\n\nwater.   According to the plaintiffs, because most traffic merely\n\npasses over the bridges and through the island on its  way to and\n\nfrom cities  in Connecticut  and Massachusetts, and  to and  from\n\nvarious highway interchanges that  are located several miles away\n\nfrom  the bridges,  the  bridges themselves  neither control  nor\n\ngenerate any traffic but merely carry it.   Thus, the bridges are\n\nallegedly  not  a  \"beginning  or  end\"  such  that   they  could\n\nreasonably be considered \"termini.\"\n\n          Plaintiffs present a strong  argument, but, given  that\n\nwe  are reviewing this case for an abuse of discretion, we cannot\n\nfind that the  district court  erred in  upholding the  agencies'\n\ndetermination of termini.   See Swain v. Brinegar, 542  F.2d 364,\n                                                 \n\n369 (7th  Cir. 1976)  (\"The task  of the court  is not  to decide\n\nwhere to  draw the line,  but to  review the matter  to ascertain\n\nwhether  the agency has made a reasonable choice.\").  The bridges\n\nmay  not \"control\" or \"generate\"  traffic in the  strict sense of\n\nthose words, but they do represent the only way that cars can get\n\nonto  and off  of  the island.    Thus, traffic  passing  through\n\nsouthern  Rhode  Island  is   controlled  by  the  existence  and\n\ncondition  of those bridges.   Although the  FHWA is  not free to\n\nconsider  every bridge  or culvert  in a highway  system to  be a\n\n                               -16-\n\nsuitable end  point for purposes of conducting  EIS analysis, two\n\nbridges  over  Narragansett Bay,  a  considerably  large body  of\n\nwater,  can  reasonably  constitute  a   major  \"highway  control\n\nelement.\"   37 Fed. Reg. 21,810.  Ultimately, when viewed through\n\nthe lens  of basic common sense, two bridges on either side of an\n\nisland appear to be perfectly logical termini to us.\n\n          None  of   the  authorities  cited  by  the  plaintiffs\n\nindicates that \"logical termini\"  must be located at interchanges\n\nor  major metropolitan  areas.   We  do  not believe  that  those\n\ndecisions which  found indistinguishable strips of  highway to be\n\nimproper termini for EIS purposes apply to the present case.  See\n                                                                 \n\nSwain 542 F.2d at  369-70; Indian Lookout Alliance v.  Volpe, 484\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 11, 19-20 (8th  Cir. 1973); Patterson v. Exon,  415 F. Supp.\n                                                  \n\n1276, 1283 (D. Neb. 1976).  We also do not find any authority for\n\nplaintiffs' assertion that the  district court erred as a  matter\n\nof  law  by considering  the  geographic  situation of  Jamestown\n\nIsland in its determination that the bridges are logical termini.\n\nIndian Lookout  Alliance, 484  F.2d at  18-19, for  example, says\n                        \n\nnothing about the propriety or impropriety of considering special\n\ngeographic features in making  logical termini analysis.  Rather,\n\nthe case simply  states that courts should look to the nature and\n\npurpose of the  project in determining which termini are logical.\n\nId.  In this case, one of the purposes of the Jamestown Connector\n  \n\nis  to facilitate traffic passing from one  side of the island to\n\nthe  other.    From this  perspective,  the  bridges are  logical\n\nendpoints.\n\n                               -17-\n\n          The  district  court  also  considered  the  two  other\n\nelements  in 23  C.F.R.    771.111(f) (\"independent  utility\" and\n\n\"reasonable alternatives\") when it found that the Jamestown FSEIS\n\nwas of the proper scope.  The court found that  these two factors\n\ncarry  more weight in this case than the \"logical termini\" prong.\n\nPlaintiffs argue  that this finding  is error because  courts can\n\nonly accord  \"logical termini\" less importance  where the highway\n\nproject  is in  a major  metropolitan area.   The  relevant cases\n\nconcerning the  reduced weight afforded to  the \"logical termini\"\n\nprong do involve  highway projects in  metropolitan areas.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., Coalition on Sensible  Transp. Inc., v. Dole, 826  F.2d 60,\n                                                  \n\n69  (D.C.  Cir.  1987);  Piedmont  Heights  Civic  Club, Inc.  v.\n                                                             \n\nMoreland, 637 F.2d 430, 440 (5th Cir. 1981).  The courts in those\n        \n\ncases, however, did not reduce the weight afforded to the termini\n\nprong simply because the area in question was urban as opposed to\n\nrural.   Rather, the courts reduced the importance of the termini\n\nfactor in those cases because it was difficult to determine where\n\nprojects  began and  ended in  convoluted urban  highway systems.\n\nCoalition on Sensible Transp., 826 F.2d at 69; Piedmont  Heights,\n                                                                \n\n637 F.2d  at 440.  Therefore,  the district court did  not err in\n\nstating that, as a  matter of law, the \"independent  utility\" and\n\n\"reasonable alternative\" prongs are more important \"where logical\n\ntermini are not so easily determined.\"   Conservation Law Found.,\n                                                               \n\n827 F. Supp. at 879.   Although the Jamestown Connector  does not\n\ninvolve the  usual spaghetti of highway  interchanges often found\n\nin   urban   centers,   it   does   involve   sufficient  special\n\n                               -18-\n\ncircumstances -- the  traversing of  an island in  the middle  of\n\nNarragansett Bay  -- to warrant  a finding that  \"logical termini\n\nare not so easily determined.\"\n\n          2.  Cumulative Impact\n\n          The  plaintiffs next  contend  that the  district court\n\nerred in finding that the Jamestown FSEIS properly considered the\n\ncumulative effects on the  environment of all projects  along the\n\nentire Route 138 corridor as required by NEPA and the regulations\n\npromulgated by the Council on  Environmental Quality (\"CEQ\").  40\n\nC.F.R.     1508.7 &amp; 1508.25(a).   The district  court stated that\n\nthe Jamestown  FSEIS \"concluded that the  Jamestown Connector was\n\nconsistent  with six other planned and  committed projects in the\n\nRoute 138 Corridor.\"  Recognizing that this was not, in itself, a\n\ncomplete  cumulative  analysis, the  court  then  added that  the\n\nJamestown  FSEIS also  referenced the  FHWA's 1984 Route  138 EIS\n\n(\"1984  FEIS\")  and the  original I-895  draft EIS  (\"1979 DEIS\")\n\nwhich  did conduct a sufficient cumulative impact analysis.1  The\n\n                    \n\n1   Plaintiffs  take issue  with the  district court's  use  of a\nquote,  Conservation  Law  Found.,  827  F.  Supp.  at  880, from\n                                 \nFritiofson v. Alexander, 772  F.2d 1225 (5th Cir. 1985),  stating\n                       \nthat a \"full-blown environmental analysis of the impacts of other\nactions\" is not  required.  Although  the plaintiffs are  correct\nthat this quote refers  to a preliminary Environmental Assessment\nand not to a more in-depth EIS, the quote does interpret the very\nsame regulations applied in  this case.  In any event,  the quote\nis  not a crucial part of  the district court opinion because the\ncourt goes on to explain why  the EISs do in fact contain a  full\ncumulative effects analysis.   Similarly, the  following sentence\non page  880, referring to  a satisfaction of  \"statutory minima\"\nunder Piedmont Heights,  637 F.2d at 441,  although pertaining to\n                      \nthe  NEPA  statute  in  general  instead   of  the  specific  CEQ\nregulations  at issue  here,  is still  applicable  to this  case\nbecause it addresses  the basic question of what  information can\nbe  used by  agencies to  analyze cumulative  effects  of various\n\n                               -19-\n\ndistrict court noted that the 1979 DEIS considered the effects of\n\nthe entire Route  138 corridor  and that the  1984 FEIS  analyzed\n\nprojects  in  Washington  County  and  Jamestown,  including  the\n\n\"general  location  and mode  choice  for what  would  become the\n\nJamestown Connector.\"   Conservation Law Found.,  827 F. Supp. at\n                                               \n\n881.\n\n          Plaintiffs first  of all contest the court's conclusion\n\nthat  the 1984  FEIS and  the 1979  DEIS conducted  the necessary\n\ncumulative analysis.  They  do not take issue with  the substance\n\nof the analysis  in these reports or with the thoroughness of the\n\nenvironmental  review  conducted  by  the  defendants.   Instead,\n\nplaintiffs challenge the geographic  scope of the area considered\n\nin those reports,  arguing that  because parts of  the Route  138\n\ncorridor were left out of the various EISs, their analyses cannot\n\nbe  completely cumulative.  They claim that the 1984 FEIS did not\n\nanalyze  proposed  actions for  the  Route 138  corridor  east of\n\nWashington County  (which is  basically the Newport  Rhode Island\n\narea where the  highway continues east of  Jamestown Island after\n\ncrossing the eastern bridge off the island).  While the 1979 DEIS\n\ndid analyze this area, it did not consider the exact same highway\n\nroutes and projects that are presently contemplated for  the area\n\n(i.e., the  original  projects  for that  area  have  since  been\n     \n\ndiscarded).  Consequently, plaintiffs  point out that neither EIS\n\n                    \n\nprojects.  We think  it is reasonable, and plaintiffs  present no\ncaselaw to the contrary, for agencies to consider  prior studies,\ndraft  or otherwise,  in  their  EISs  and  to  include  them  by\nreference.\n\n                               -20-\n\nanalyzed two  of the  six  projects listed  within the  Jamestown\n\nFSEIS as part of  the Route 138 corridor (the  Newport Circulator\n\nand East Main Road upgrade).2\n\n          For  us, the bottom line  is that the relevant agencies\n\nconducted  an analysis  of  the environmental  impact of  highway\n\nconstruction  projects along Route 138.   The 1979  and 1984 EISs\n\ncontain in-depth discussions  (300 pages worth  in the 1979  DEIS\n\nand  200  pages in  the  1984  FEIS)  covering  a wide  range  of\n\nenvironmental  concerns surrounding  highway construction  in the\n\narea of Route  138.  For its part, the Jamestown FSEIS explicitly\n\nreferenced the two prior EISs  and placed the Jamestown connector\n\nin  the context of  the entire Route  138 corridor project.   The\n\n1979  and 1984  EISs  may not  have  covered precisely  the  same\n\ngeographical  areas  or  projects  that are  now  being  built or\n\nproposed in  conjunction with  the Jamestown Connector,  but they\n\ndid sufficiently  consider the  incremental impact  of individual\n\n                    \n\n2  Plaintiffs also claim that the 1984 FEIS \"deferred analysis of\nthe  Jamestown  Connector,\"  by  noting several  times  that  the\nprocess for deciding on the construction design and route for the\nJamestown  Connector was  ongoing and  that no decision  had been\nmade.    Therefore,  plaintiffs  argue, the  1984  FEIS  did  not\nproperly  consider the  cumulative impact  of all  projects taken\ntogether in its environmental analysis.  This argument strikes us\nas a red  herring.  The 1984 FEIS clearly  contemplated some kind\nof  highway construction  between  the two  bridges on  Jamestown\nIsland  and it explicitly discussed the fact that a more in-depth\nenvironmental study of the island would be done in a supplemental\nEIS.  A full  description of the environment on  Jamestown island\nwas  included  in  the  1984  FEIS.    The  Jamestown  FSEIS  was\nsubsequently  written as a supplement  to the 1984  FEIS and both\nEISs  contemplated  that the  two would  be  read together.   The\ndistrict  court  found  this  to  be  sufficient  to satisfy  the\ncumulative impact  analysis requirement  and we see  no abuse  of\ndiscretion in this ruling.\n\n                               -21-\n\nsections  of Route  138 construction \"when  added to  other past,\n\npresent and  reasonably foreseeable future actions.\"  40 C.F.R.  \n\n1508.7.   We therefore do  not believe the  district court abused\n\nits discretion  in rejecting the plaintiffs'  contention that the\n\naforementioned discrepancies in the EISs violated NEPA.\n\n          Plaintiffs  nevertheless  maintain  that  even  if  the\n\ncombined  analyses contained  in all  the EISs  constitute proper\n\ncumulative  impact review, the process of referencing them in the\n\nJamestown  FSEIS  does not  comport  with  the cumulative  impact\n\nrequirements  in   the  CEQ   regulations.    According   to  the\n\nplaintiffs, a  particular EIS cannot incorporate  the findings of\n\nother  EISs unless it  is part of  a proper \"tiering\"  process as\n\nprovided for in 23 C.F.R.   771.111(g).  Under   777.111(g):\n\n            For  major  transportation  actions,  the\n            tiering  of EISs as  discussed in the CEQ\n            regulation (40  C.F.R.   1502.20)  may be\n            appropriate.   The  first tier  EIS would\n            focus on broad issues  . . . . The second\n            tier would  address site-specific details\n            . . . .\n\nThe  district court found the \"tiering\" of the Jamestown FSEIS on\n\ntop of the 1984 FEIS and 1979 DEIS to be proper in this case.\n\n          Plaintiffs claim this finding is erroneous because: (1)\n\nthe 1979  DEIS was just a  draft having no legal  effect; (2) the\n\n1984 FEIS did not qualify as a programmatic evaluation upon which\n\nsmaller  projects could be tiered; and (3) the Route 138 Corridor\n\nis  not a  sufficiently large,  wide-ranging federal  project for\n\nwhich tiering is appropriate.\n\n          Although the plaintiffs are  correct that the 1979 DEIS\n\n                               -22-\n\nhas  no legal effect  and cannot, by  itself, serve as  the first\n\ntier in the  EIS process,  nothing that the  plaintiffs point  to\n\nprecludes  a final  EIS from  referring to  the reports  and data\n\ncontained  in  a draft  EIS  to  analyze  cumulative  impacts  of\n\ngovernmental actions.  Thus, the information in the 1979 DEIS can\n\nbe  considered a part of the cumulative impact analysis for Route\n\n138.\n\n          The plaintiffs further argue that the 1984 FEIS was not\n\nsufficiently  comprehensive to  constitute  a programmatic  first\n\ntier that can support the second tier in the Jamestown FSEIS.  To\n\nsupport  this  contention,  plaintiffs  basically  restate  their\n\nearlier argument that  the 1984  FEIS failed to  analyze all  the\n\nproposed projects  along  the  entire Route  138  corridor.    To\n\nbriefly restate our rejection of this argument, the 1984 FEIS not\n\nonly addressed the Route 138 corridor in a comprehensive fashion,\n\nit explicitly contemplated that a supplemental EIS, the Jamestown\n\nFSEIS, would be prepared in conjunction with the larger  EIS.  We\n\nsee  no abuse  of  discretion  in finding  this  to be  a  proper\n\napplication of the tiering  regulations.  Cases relied on  by the\n\nplaintiff  to  support  its  contention that  the  1984  FEIS  is\n\nincomplete,  Kleppe v.  Sierra  Club, 427  U.S. 390,  410 (1976);\n                                    \n\nNational Wildlife Fed.  v. Appalachian Reg. Comm'n, 677 F.2d 883,\n                                                  \n\n888  (D.C. Cir. 1981), discuss when a single, programmatic EIS is\n\nrequired,  but they do not dictate the precise manner and content\n\nof  those programmatic EISs.   In this case,  it is reasonable to\n\nconclude  that  the 1984  EIS  considered  together the  combined\n\n                               -23-\n\nconsequences  of   proposed  actions   along  Route  138.     See\n                                                                 \n\nAppalachian Reg. Comm'n, 677 F.2d at 888.\n                       \n\n          Finally, plaintiffs claim  that the Route 138  Corridor\n\ncannot  be tiered  because  it  does  not  qualify  as  a  \"major\n\ntransportation  action.\"   Because  plaintiffs point  to no  case\n\nauthority   for   imposing   a  \"major   transportation   action\"\n\nrequirement  in the tiering context, we find this assertion to be\n\nunfounded.  Plaintiffs cite cases involving \"wide ranging federal\n\nprojects\" for which broad \"programmatic\" EISs have been prepared.\n\nSee Kleppe v.  Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390 (1976) (development of a\n                          \n\nnational  coal leasing  program); Tenakee  Springs v.  Block, 778\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  1402  (9th  Cir. 1985)  (land  use  plans  for the  Tongass\n\nNational  Forest);  National Wildlife  Fed.  v.

None of  these cases  say anything  about the\n\nrequirements for tiering,  nor do they  say anything to  indicate\n\nthat  a  highway project,  like Route  138,  cannot qualify  as a\n\n\"major  transportation action\"  or even  a \"wide  ranging federal\n\nproject.\"  Consequently,  plaintiffs provide no  basis for us  to\n\nfind a manifest error of law with respect to the district court's\n\ntiering ruling.\n\n          Even if NEPA  did require  that a first  tier EIS  must\n\ncover  a  \"major transportation  action,\"  Route  138 appears  to\n\nqualify.  Plaintiffs describe  the Route 138 project as  merely a\n\n\"40-mile  state highway that is  being upgraded with  the help of\n\nfederal funds.\"   Even if this characterization is  accurate, the\n\n                               -24-\n\ndistrict court  did not  abuse  its discretion  in finding  forty\n\nmiles of  highway crossing  Narragansett Bay and  passing through\n\nseveral different islands to be a \"major transportation action.\"\n\n          3.  Actions of the Army Corps of Engineers\n\n          Under   404  of the  CWA, the Army  Corps of  Engineers\n\n(the  \"Corps\") must  prepare an  EIS in  compliance with  NEPA if\n\nthere is  a \"substantial  possibility\" that the  proposed actions\n\n(in this  case, the granting of a  permit to fill wetlands) could\n\n\"significantly  affect\"  the  environment.    For  the  Jamestown\n\nConnector,   the  Corps  prepared   a  preliminary  Environmental\n\nAssessment (\"EA\")  and found  no significant impact  warranting a\n\nfull  EIS.   While  the record  does  contain evidence  that  the\n\nproject will  detrimentally affect  some wetlands, this  evidence\n\ndoes not overwhelmingly contradict the Corps' conclusion that the\n\nproject  will not  \"significantly affect\"  the environment.   The\n\ndistrict court upheld the  Corps' determina- tion and we  find no\n\nabuse of discretion on the part of the court or the Corps.\n\n          The district court  also found that  the Corps did  not\n\nimproperly segment their analysis  in the EA or fail  to consider\n\ncumulative  effects.   Plaintiffs  claim error  but the  district\n\ncourt  responded fully  to  their objections.   Conservation  Law\n                                                                 \n\nFound., 827 F.

OF TRANSPORTATION ACT CLAIMS\n                                                             \n\n          Under    404 of the  Clean Water Act,  the Corps cannot\n\nissue  a permit to fill  wetlands if there  exists a \"practicable\n\nalternative\"4  to  the  proposed  action  that  would  have  less\n\nadverse   impact.    Likewise,   the  FHWA  may   not  approve  a\n\ntransportation  project  under      4(f)  of  the  Department  of\n\nTransportation Act  which encroaches on a  National Historic Site\n\nunless no \"prudent and feasible\" alternative exists.\n\n          Plaintiffs  claim  that  the district  court  erred  in\n\ncrediting  the determination of the Corps and the FHWA that there\n\nwere   no  practicable  alternative   designs  to  the  Jamestown\n\nConnector  project.    Specifically,  plaintiffs  argue  that the\n\nagencies failed to  consider the so-called \"Todd design\" which is\n\nidentical to the design  actually chosen (the FHWA and  the Corps\n\nchose \"Alternative  B\") except that  a stoplight and  an at-grade\n\nintersection  would  replace a  proposed overpass  at one  of the\n\nmajor intersections on the island.\n\n          Although the defendants did not explicitly consider the\n\nTodd design itself, the  district court found that the  Corps and\n\nthe FHWA  did consider the main feature of the Todd design -- the\n\n                    \n\nway casting serious doubt on the validity of the district court's\nholding.\n\n4  40 C.F.R.   230.10(a)(2) provides that:\n\n            An  alternative is  practicable if  it is\n            available  and  capable  of  being  done,\n            after  taking  into  consideration  cost,\n            existing  technology,  and  logistics  in\n            light of overall project purposes.\n\n                               -26-\n\nat-grade  intersection  in place  of  the overpass  --  when they\n\nevaluated  two  other  alternatives   (Alternatives  A  and  A1).\n\nPlaintiffs  object to this because Alternatives  A and A1 involve\n\nan  unlimited access road and  other features not  present in the\n\nTodd design.   Therefore,  plaintiffs contend, the  conclusion by\n\nthe  defendant agencies  that  Alternatives  A  and  A1  are  not\n\npracticable because they  involve significant traffic  congestion\n\nand safety hazards  does not necessarily apply to  an alternative\n\nthat  removes all the traffic  hazards with the  exception of one\n\nstoplight at a major intersection.\n\n          This  is a valid  objection, but plaintiffs' contention\n\ndoes not justify a finding of an abuse of discretion or  manifest\n\nerror  of law.  Technical  discrepancies may have existed between\n\nalternatives  actually considered  and an  alternative  which, if\n\nconsidered,  may have been found to be more practicable.  The two\n\nalternatives considered,  however, were somewhat similar  in that\n\nthey  both contained an element of  major concern to the Corps --\n\nan at-grade  intersection which could lead  to traffic congestion\n\nand safety problems.  This similarity is sufficient to render the\n\nCorps' substantive analysis acceptable.\n\n          Plaintiffs also  argue that because two other agencies,\n\nthe Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") and the U.S. Fish and\n\nWildlife Service  (\"FWS\"), criticized  the FHWA's  conclusions in\n\nthe 1987 FSEIS, the  Corps could not \"blindly rely\" on the FHWA's\n\nconclusion  that  Alternative  B  was  the least  environmentally\n\ndamaging practicable  alternative.  As the  district court points\n\n                               -27-\n\nout, however, the Corps did not \"blindly rely\" on the 1987 FSEIS.\n\nRather, the Corps supplemented the FHWA's evaluation with its own\n\nadministrative record, studies, and responses  to public comment.\n\nThe district court's finding is not an abuse of discretion.\n\n          Finally,    4(f) of the DOT requires that the FHWA must\n\nundertake all  possible planning  to minimize harm  to historical\n\nsites.    Plaintiffs  argue  that  the  Todd  design  alternative\n\nconstitutes an example of  required planning which would minimize\n\nsuch harm.  Under   4(f), agency determinations that a particular\n\nplan  minimizes harm  to  historical sites  deserve even  greater\n\ndeference  than  agency  determinations   concerning  practicable\n\nalternatives.

Jurisdiction\n\n          We address, first of all, the defendants' argument that\n                                                  \n\nthe federal court  has no jurisdiction over plaintiffs' Clean Air\n\nAct  (\"CAA\") claims  -- an  issue not  addressed by  the district\n\ncourt but one that we nevertheless may notice on  appeal.

The defendants\n           \n\nclaim  that the  language of  the citizen  suit provision  of the\n\nClean  Air Act, 42 U.S.C.   7604(a)(1), which authorizes suits to\n\nenforce  violations  of  an  \"emission  standard or  limitation,\"\n\nlimits such  suits to  cases involving standards  and limitations\n\nset  in a state implementation plan or  standards set by the EPA.\n\nBecause the  present  suit does  not involve  the enforcement  of\n\nstandards set out in  a state or EPA plan,  defendants argue that\n\nthe  district   court  had   no  jurisdiction  to   consider  the\n\nplaintiffs' claims in the first place.  We disagree.\n\n          Under CAA's  citizen  suit provision,  any  person  may\n\ncommence  a civil  action to enforce  violations of  an \"emission\n\nstandard or  limitation under  this chapter.\"   42  U.S.C.   7604\n\n(a)(1).  The term \"emission standard or limitation\" is defined by\n\n42 U.S.C.   7604(f) as a \"standard  of performance . . . which is\n\nin  effect  under  this chapter  .  . .  or  under  an applicable\n                                           \n\nimplementation plan.\"5 (emphasis added).   According to its plain\n\n                    \n\n5  Defendants' use  of the definition for \"emissions  standard or\nlimitation\"  provided  in  42  U.S.C.    7602(k)  (a  requirement\n\"established by the State  or Administrator\") is improper because\n\n                               -29-\n\nlanguage, this  section includes  \"standards of  performance\" set\n\nout  in  the  Act  itself.   The  specific  statutory  provisions\n\nenumerated in   7604(f)(3) are  not the only statutory provisions\n\nthat can be enforced  under the citizen suit provision.   Rather,\n\nas  long  as  the  claimed  violation  involves  a  \"standard  of\n\nperformance\" \"under\" the CAA, the court has jurisdiction pursuant\n\nto   7604(f)(1), even though  the standard is not imposed  by the\n\nstatutory sections enumerated in   7604(f)(3).\n\n          In   this   case,   plaintiffs  are   challenging   the\n\ndefendants'  violation  of the  CAA  conformity  requirements, 42\n\nU.S.C.    7506 (c)(1)  &amp;  (c)(3), which  mandate that  defendants\n\ndemonstrate that their  transportation projects \"would contribute\n\nto annual  emissions reductions  consistent with\" the  levels set\n\nout  in     7511a(b)(1)  and     7512a(a)(7).   These  conformity\n\nrequirements  plainly   constitute  an  emissions   \"standard  of\n\nperformance\" as that  term is defined in 42 U.S.C.    7602(l) (\"a\n\nrequirement  of  continuous  emission  reduction,  including  any\n\nrequirement relating to the operation  or maintenance of a source\n\nto assure  continuous emission reduction\").   Therefore,  because\n\nthe citizen suit provision allows for suits to enforce \"standards\n\nof  performance,\"   42  U.S.C.     7604(f)(1),   this  court  has\n\njurisdiction over plaintiffs'  CAA claims.

We do  not believe, however, that any of\n\nthese cases have satisfactorily  explained why the plain language\n\nof   7604(f)(1)  would not apply to suits like  the one before us\n\nin this case.  Instead, these cases seem primarily concerned with\n\ndeclining to allow plaintiffs to use   7604 as a vehicle to force\n\ngovernment  agencies or  instrumentalities to  comply  with their\n\ngeneral obligations under the  Clean Air Act.  See,  e.g., League\n                                                                 \n\nto  Save Tahoe,  598 F.2d  at 1168-70,  1173; see  also Coalition\n                                                                 \n\nAgainst Columbus Ctr. v.

Thus, these cases restrict  the\n\nuse of   7604 to  violations of \"objective evidentiary standards\"\n\nand avoid suits requiring a \"reanalysis of technological or other\n\nconsiderations at the enforcement stage.\"  E.g., Wilder, 854 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat 614.\n\n          The  present case is distinguishable in that plaintiffs\n\nsubstantive claims involve statutory  provisions that are  fairly\n\nspecific  and  objective.  See  42  U.S.C.     7506(c)(3)(A)(iii)\n                              \n\n(requiring  transportation  plans  -- which  involve  exclusively\n                          \n\npollution  from automobile  emissions  -- to  be consistent  with\n\n  7511   a(b)(1)   which   requires   states   to  formulate   an\n\nimplementation plan that reduces certain pollutants by 15% from a\n\n1990  baseline  level).   The  provision  is  more  similar to  a\n\nspecific  emission control  standard  applicable  to  a  specific\n\nsource,  than  a  general  air  quality  standard  which  may  be\n\naccomplished   in   any  number   of   ways   depending  on   the\n\n\"technological considerations\" of the state  or agency developing\n\nthe implementation plan designed to reach the proscribed level of\n\nair quality.   Thus, even under  the aforementioned caselaw,  the\n\nfederal court has jurisdiction over this case.6\n\n          2.

The\npreliminary  evaluation set  out above  provides ample  basis for\nproceeding to the merits.   However, because the outcome  of this\ncase  does not depend upon our  jurisdictional ruling, this Court\nremains free to revisit the  issue in a future case where  it may\nbe decisive. \n\n                               -32-\n\nfederal  government  may  not  authorize,  fund  or  support  any\n\nactivity   that  does   not  \"conform\"   to  an   approved  State\n\nImplementation Plan (\"SIP\").  During the relevant period  in this\n\ncase (i.e.,  an  \"interim  period\" when  no  conforming  SIP  yet\n\nexists), conformity  for \"transportation plans  and programs\"  in\n\nRhode  Island  was  demonstrated by  showing  that  the  plan and\n\nprogram  \"contribute[d] to annual emissions reductions consistent\n\nwith   7511a(b)(1) and   7512a(a)(7) of this title.\"  42 U.S.C.  \n\n7506(c)(3)(A)(iii).    In  this  case,  the  relevant  \"plan  and\n\nprogram\" are Rhode Island's Transportation Improvement Program of\n\n1991 (\"TIP\") and its  Transportation Plan of 1992 (\"Plan\").   The\n\nchallenged governmental actions  include the FHWA's authorization\n\nof  construction on the Jamestown  Connector in July  of 1992 and\n\nthe Corps'  issuance of a permit to fill wetlands in May of 1992.\n\nThe  defendants also adopted and  approved the TIP  and the Plan,\n\nactions which the plaintiffs also challenge.\n\n          The district  court found: (1) that  Rhode Island's TIP\n\nand  Plan conformed with the requirements of the CAA because they\n\ncontributed   to  annual  emissions  reductions  consistent  with\n\n  7511a(b)(1);  and (2) that, regardless, the Jamestown Connector\n\nproject was not subject to further conformity review  pursuant to\n\nregulations in effect at the time of approval.  23 C.F.R.   770.9\n\n(d)(3) (w/drawn Dec. 22, 1992, 57 Fed.

Because the district court's  second finding is\n\ndispositive  in this case,  we do not reach  the issues raised in\n\nthe court's first finding.\n\n          Plaintiffs  claim  that  the  regulation  found  by the\n\ndistrict court  to insulate the Jamestown  Connector from further\n\nconformity review, 23 C.F.R.   770.9(d)(3),  does nothing to stop\n\nthe  ban on federal support of nonconforming projects provided in\n\n  7506(c)  as part  of  the 1990  CAA  Amendments.   (Again,  the\n\nchallenged   actions  include   the   FHWA's   authorization   of\n\nconstruction and the Corps' issuance of a permit to fill wetlands\n\nin 1992).  According  to the plaintiffs, the 1990  CAA Amendments\n\neither  trump the effect of the regulation or simply provide new,\n\nindependent  conformity requirements  that  must  be  met  before\n\nfederal  action can be taken  on any project,  regardless of that\n\nproject's own conformity status.   In other words,  the Jamestown\n\nConnector may  itself conform to the CAA, but the TIP and Plan do\n\nnot, so the government is  barred from taking any actions  in the\n\nentire state, including actions for the Jamestown Connector.\n\n          Specifically,  plaintiffs  read      7506(c)(3)(B)7  to\n\n                    \n\n7  42  U.S.C.    7506(c)(3)(B) provides, in  relevant part,  that\nconformity  of transportation  projects  will be  demonstrated if\nthey:\n\n            (i) come from a conforming transportation\n            plan   and   program   as    defined   in\n            subparagraph (A) or  for 12 months  after\n            November 15, 1990, from  a transportation\n            program  found to conform  within 3 years\n            prior to such date of enactment.\n\n                               -34-\n\nmandate  that  no  transportation  project  may  receive  federal\n                 \n\nfunding or  support unless  the project  comes from  a conforming\n\nPlan  and TIP as defined  in 7506(c)(3)(A) or,  until November of\n\n1991,  from a  plan or  program found to  conform within  3 years\n\nprior  to November 15,  1990.  The  issue before us  is whether  \n\n7506(c)(3) applies to all projects regardless of their status, or\n\njust  to  projects  that   have  yet  to  receive   a  conformity\n\ndetermination as of November, 1990.\n\n          Without delving  into statutory  minutiae -- and,  as a\n\nconsequence,  declining  the parties'  invitation  to  engage the\n\nbattle  of dueling legislative histories -- we believe that it is\n\ncertainly  reasonable  for  the  district  court  to (implicitly)\n\ninterpret  the grace  period provision  in    7506(c)(3)(B)(i) as\n\napplying  only prospectively and  not to  past projects  like the\n\nJamestown Connector.   First of all,   7506(c)(3)(B) does not say\n\nthat  no project can receive federal support unless it comes from\n\na  conforming transportation  plan.   Instead,  the grace  period\n\nsentence relied on by the plaintiffs,   7506(c)(3)(B)(i), is part\n\nof a provision explaining the manner in which the \"conformity\" of\n\nplans, TIPs and projects will be demonstrated for purposes of the\n\nrestriction in   7506(c)(1).  Plans whose conformity  has already\n\nbeen demonstrated do  not appear  to fall under  the auspices  of\n\nthis provision.  The grace period in 7506(c)(3)(B)(i) talks about\n\nprojects that \"come from  . . . a transportation program found to\n                                                        \n\nconform within 3 years prior to\" November 1991.   It says nothing\n\nabout  the project itself being found to conform during the prior\n\n                               -35-\n\n3 years.  Consequently, the provision seems specifically aimed at\n\nprojects  whose conformity had yet to be demonstrated by the time\n\nthe 1990  Amendments took effect.8   The Jamestown  Connector was\n\nfound to conform in 1988 at the latest (by means  of the approval\n\nof the Jamestown FSEIS) and we  see no indication in   7506(c)(3)\n\nthat Congress intended to abrogate this determination.\n\n          Furthermore,  the language  of    7506(c)(3)  -- \"Until\n\nsuch time as the implementation plan  revision . . . is approved,\n\nconformity  of   such  plans,  programs  and   projects  will  be\n\ndemonstrated  if .  . .\" --  sounds like  it is  referring to the\n\n\"interim  period,\" that is, the time between the enactment of the\n\nAmendments and the adoption of the new SIPs.  Thus, a prospective\n\napplication  of the provision seems particularly appropriate and,\n\nconversely, a retroactive application particularly inappropriate.\n\nThis interpretation  of   7506(c)(3) has  apparently been adopted\n\nby the  EPA and the  Department of  Transportation.  See  June 7,\n                                                        \n\nEnvironmental  Protection  Agency  and  Dept.  of  Transportation\n                                                                 \n\nGuidance  for  Determining  Conformity of  Transportation  Plans,\n                                                                 \n\nPrograms  and Projects  With Clean  Air Act  Implementation Plans\n                                                                 \n\nDuring Phase  I of the Interim Period, June 7, 1991 at 22-23, 24-\n                                     \n\n                    \n\n8  For this reason, the plaintiffs' argument that the defendants'\ninterpretation of    7506(c)(3)(B)(i)  would make  that provision\nsuperfluous  is specious.   Presumably,  there existed  plenty of\nprojects in  1990 that  were not as  far along  as the  Jamestown\nConnector and had not yet received a conformity determination, as\ndid  Jamestown, prior to the 1990 Amendments.  Those projects may\nhave \"come  from\" conforming Plans  and TIPs  at the time  of the\nAmendments,  but  the projects  themselves had  yet to  receive a\ndetermination  of conformity.  As  a result, the  grace period in\n  7506(c)(3)(B)(i)  was   enacted  to  address   these  types  of\nprojects.\n\n                               -36-\n\n25 (interpreting   7506(c)(3) to apply only to projects that have\n\nyet to receive conformity determinations);  see also 58 Fed.

It  is  well\n\nestablished that we afford  considerable deference to an agency's\n\ninterpretation of a  statute that  it is  primarily charged  with\n\nenforcing, especially  a complicated  one like the  CAA.

In  total, plaintiffs  allege\n            violations of five federal statutes:  the\n            National    Environmental    Policy   Act\n            (\"NEPA\"),    the    Intermodal    Surface\n            Transportation Efficiency  Act \"(ISTEA\"),\n            the   Clean   Water   Act  (\"CWA\"),   the\n            Department of Transportation Act (\"DOT\"),\n            and the Clean Air Act (\"CAA\").\n\n                     II.  Factual Background\n\n               The  history  of this  highway project\n            dates back to proposed Interstate Highway\n            895  (\"I-895\"),  which received  original\n            approval in December 1969  as part of the\n\n                               -5-\n\n            Interstate  and  Defense Highway  System.\n            The  original  proposed  12.1 mile  route\n            spanned Narragansett  Bay between Warwick\n            and Barrington, Rhode  Island.  In  1974,\n            FHWA  approved  a  RIDOT  proposal  which\n            recommended  a  substitute  route.    The\n            proposed  substitute  I-895   essentially\n            tracked Route 138,  an undivided  roadway\n            dating  from the early  1920's, from I-95\n            in  Richmond,  Rhode Island  to  I-195 in\n            either    Swansea    or    Fall    River,\n            Massachusetts.   Route  138 is  the  only\n            road crossing Narragansett  Bay south  of\n            Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n               In November 1975,  RIDOT initiated  an\n            Environmental  Impact  Statement/Corridor\n            Location Study for designated I-895.   In\n            April  1979,  RIDOT  published the  I-895\n            Draft   Environmental  Impact   Statement\n            (\"DEIS\").  The 1979 DEIS  recognized that\n            Route   138   \"was   not    intended   to\n            accommodate   the   types  of   vehicles,\n            prevailing  operating   speeds,  and  the\n            volumes of traffic\" that it then carried.\n            Following  the  publication of  the DEIS,\n            community  comment  was received  at four\n            public  hearings.   On February  5, 1982,\n            the  State  of  Rhode   Island  requested\n            withdrawal  of  proposed  I-895 from  the\n            Interstate Highway System.   On  December\n            30,  1982,  FHWA approved  Rhode Island's\n            withdrawal request because I-895  was not\n            \"essential to the completion of a unified\n            and    connected   Interstate    System.\"\n            (Fed.Def.Exh. 6)  Much of the proposed I-\n            895 corridor,  however, remained eligible\n            for   federal    funds   for   substitute\n            projects.\n\n               The  1979  DEIS  contained a  separate\n            section addressing the construction  of a\n            Jamestown  Bridge  replacement structure.\n            Because  of its  functional obsolescence,\n            increases     in     traffic     volumes,\n            skyrocketing  maintenance  costs and  the\n            need for a  completely new concrete deck,\n            RIDOT determined that  the existing  two-\n            lane Jamestown Bridge needed replacement.\n            The  Surface  Transportation Act  of 1978\n            specifically    allocated   discretionary\n            funding   under    the   Highway   Bridge\n\n                               -6-\n\n            Replacement  Program   to  implement  the\n            Jamestown Bridge replacement project.  As\n            a result, FHWA authorized the development\n            of   a  site-specific   Jamestown  Bridge\n            Environmental Impact Statement (\"JBEIS\").\n            The   JBEIS,   completed  in   May  1989,\n            proposed  a four-lane  replacement bridge\n            adjacent to the existing bridge and four-\n            lane access roadways extending from Route\n            1A in  North Kingstown to Helm  Street on\n            Jamestown.\n\n               Following the decision to  withdraw I-\n            895, RIDOT continued  to examine the need\n            for improvements throughout the Route 138\n            Corridor.  RIDOT's analysis culminated in\n            1984  with   the  issuance  of   a  Final\n            Environmental  Impact Statement  (\"FEIS\")\n            for the corridor.  FHWA approved the FEIS\n            on  September 27,  1984.   The  1984 FEIS\n            study   area    encompassed   Washington,\n            Newport,  and  Bristol Counties  in Rhode\n            Island,     as    well     as    Swansea,\n            Massachusetts.  In Washington County, the\n            FEIS  proposed a  mixture of  upgrades to\n            certain existing portions of Route 138, a\n            no-build  option  for  other portions  of\n            Route  138,  and   construction  of   new\n            roadways in other  areas of the corridor.\n            On Jamestown Island, the FEIS  proposed a\n            four-lane   reconstruction   along    the\n            available right  of way on  Eldred Avenue\n            (1.1  miles)  and two  possible four-lane\n            alternatives  for  East  Shore Road  (1.1\n            miles).   The FEIS   recognized  that the\n            Jamestown    Design    Study    Committee\n            (\"JDSC\"),  which  had   been  formed   in\n            February  of  1983,  was considering  the\n            entire   connector  roadway   system  for\n            Jamestown Island.  Accordingly,  the FEIS\n            contemplated draft and final supplemental\n            EIS documents for  the project  following\n            decisions   by  JDSC   and  RIDOT.     On\n            Aquidneck    Island,   the    1984   FEIS\n            recognized the need for  improvements but\n            proposed   a  no-build   alternative  and\n            recommended  further  studies.   Finally,\n            the  FEIS proposed a  no-build option for\n            the East Shore portion of the  study area\n            including  Bristol  County, Rhode  Island\n            and Swansea, Massachusetts.\n\n                               -7-\n\n               Following  the  1984  FEIS,  the  JDSC\n            convened  numerous   public  meetings  on\n            Jamestown    and   collected    community\n            reaction  to  the  proposed  cross-island\n            roadway.  Based upon community input, the\n            JDSC  recommended  a  conceptual plan  to\n            RIDOT  in June  1984 which,  with certain\n            refinements, became  known as Alternative\n            B.   Alternative B  proposed a controlled\n            access  four-lane roadway  extending from\n            the  Jamestown-Verrazzano   Bridge  along\n            Eldred Avenue with  interchanges at  Helm\n            Street and  North Road and flowing into a\n            new  four-lane  roadway  located west  of\n            East Shore Road extending to  the Newport\n            Bridge.\n\n               Based  on the  JDSC's recommendations,\n            RIDOT  completed   a  draft  supplemental\n            environmental impact  statement (\"DSEIS\")\n            in April  1986.   The  FHWA approved  the\n            DSEIS  on  April  22, 1986.    The  DSEIS\n            considered six alternatives for  a cross-\n            island roadway on Jamestown:   a No-Build\n            Alternative,  the  Transportation Systems\n            Management   (\"TSM\")   Alternative,   two\n            unlimited access roadways (Alternatives A\n            and  A1), and two limited access roadways\n            (Alternatives  B  and   C).    The  DSEIS\n            identified  Alternative  B, now  known as\n            the   \"Jamestown   Connector\",   as   the\n            preferred alternative.   RIDOT circulated\n            the  DSEIS on  May  23, 1986  and held  a\n            public    hearing   at    the   Jamestown\n            Elementary School on June 26, 1986.\n\n               Following the submission of the DSEIS,\n            RIDOT  began  pursuing necessary  permits\n            for  Alternative B from  the Rhode Island\n            Department  of  Environmental  Management\n            (\"RIDEM\").  Pursuant to provisions of the\n            Administrative  Procedure  Act and  Rhode\n            Island's   Freshwater  Wetlands   Act,  a\n            wetland  public  hearing   was  held   on\n            February  10,  1987  to   resolve  issues\n            pertaining   to   wetland   impacts   and\n            Alternative  B.   Following  the hearing,\n            RIDOT   and   RIDEM   signed  a   consent\n            agreement which modified Alternative B to\n            minimize  wetlands  impact.    The  RIDEM\n            Wetlands    Public     Hearing    Officer\n            incorporated   the   conditions  of   the\n\n                               -8-\n\n            consent agreement into  the final  design\n            and  order rendered  on  April 30,  1987.\n            The  order  specified conditional  permit\n            approval to alter freshwater wetlands.\n\n               RIDOT  completed a  final supplemental\n            environmental impact statement  (\"FSEIS\")\n            for the Jamestown  Connector in July 1987\n            and   FHWA   approved   the    FSEIS   on\n            December 18, 1987.   The FSEIS  responded\n            to  comments received  on the  1986 DSEIS\n            and  investigated  the  same  six  design\n            alternatives,  with  some  modifications,\n            considered by the  1986 DSEIS.  According\n            to the FSEIS, traffic safety and drainage\n            concerns     rendered     the    No-Build\n            Alternative and the  TSM Alternative  not\n            viable.    The  unlimited access  upgrade\n            alternatives,   A   and  A1,   failed  to\n            separate   local  and   through  traffic,\n            failed  to  maintain highway  continuity,\n            permitted continued development along the\n            alignment frontage, and allowed  for high\n            traffic    volumes,     congestion    and\n            increasing accident rates.  Alternative C\n            affected  the  greatest  acreage  in  the\n            Windmill   Hill  Historic   District  and\n            failed to attract support  from Jamestown\n            residents  because  of undesirable  local\n            access    designs.       Alternative   B,\n            meanwhile, provided the greatest benefits\n            while minimizing adverse  impacts to  the\n            residents  and   surrounding  environment\n            according to the FSEIS.  As a result, the\n            FSEIS  identified  Alternative  B as  the\n            preferred alternative.  On May  27, 1988,\n            FHWA  issued a Record of Decision (\"ROD\")\n            on the FSEIS which expressly ratified the\n            selection  of  Alternative B  for further\n            project development.\n\n               The 1987 FSEIS also  found Alternative\n            B to be consistent with six other planned\n            and committed highway projects within the\n            Route 138 Corridor:   the I-95 to Route 2\n            upgrade; the relocation of Route 138 from\n            Route 2 to U.S. 1;  the reconstruction of\n            Route 138  from U.S.  1 to the  Jamestown\n            Bridge; the Jamestown Bridge Replacement;\n            the Newport Circulator  Project; and  the\n            Route 138 upgrading along East  Main Road\n            from  Route   24  to  Route  113.     The\n\n                               -9-\n\n            cumulative   impacts   of  the   projects\n            located   in    Washington   County   and\n            Jamestown   (all   projects  except   the\n            Newport Circulator and the East Main Road\n            upgrade) had been previously  analyzed in\n            the  corridor-wide  1979  DEIS  and  1984\n            FEIS.\n\n               RIDOT  proposed reconstruction  of the\n            two-lane roadway from I-95  to Route 2 in\n            three phases.  Phase one was completed in\n            1981 and the other  two phases are in the\n            preliminary   design    stage.      RIDOT\n            reevaluated the FEIS  for the  relocation\n            of  Route 138 from  Route 2 to  U.S. 1 in\n            February 1991 and  modified the  original\n            alignment.   The roadway from Route  1 to\n            the  Jamestown  Bridge,  approved in  the\n            1981 JBEIS, was constructed  during 1992.\n            The   new   Jamestown-Verrazzano   Bridge\n            replaced the Jamestown Bridge  and opened\n            to  traffic on  October  19,  1992.   The\n            Newport   Circulator  Project   has  been\n            replaced   by   a   series    of   lesser\n            improvements  expected  to  be  forwarded\n            with  a  request  for  a  Finding  of  No\n            Significant  Impact  (\"FONSI\") in  Summer\n            1993.      Finally,  the   FHWA  approved\n            improvements to the  four-lane East  Main\n            Road  on December 24,  1991 and selection\n            of a consultant to  begin final design is\n            underway.\n\n               The 1987 FSEIS  also examined  impacts\n            to   parklands  and   historic  resources\n            governed   by   Section   4(f)   of   the\n            Department of  Transportation Act (\"DOT\")\n            and Section 106  of the National Historic\n            Preservation   Act.     This   evaluation\n            focuses  on  the  Windmill Hill  Historic\n            District   and    examined   four   build\n            alternatives, a No-Build Alternative, and\n            an Avoidance Alternative.   Although  the\n            No-Build  Alternative  would not  impinge\n            upon  historic  resources,  it failed  to\n            meet the project goals and was determined\n            to be neither prudent nor  feasible.  All\n            four of the build  alternatives adversely\n            effected   the  Windmill   Hill  Historic\n            District.    The  FSEIS  determined  that\n            Alternatives  A  and  A1, both  four-lane\n            uncontrolled  access   roadways  with  at\n\n                               -10-\n\n            grade  intersections,  carried  far  less\n            short-term impacts  on historic resources\n            than  the  preferred alternative.   These\n            alternatives,  however,  failed  to  meet\n            traffic service and  safety concerns  and\n            permitted   the  possibility   of  future\n            development  which  could   have  a   far\n            greater long-term impact on  the historic\n            district.    The  FSEIS  determined  that\n            Alternative C, a  limited access  highway\n            on  a  different alignment,  required the\n            use  of  more  historic   resources  than\n            Alternative    B    without     providing\n            offsetting  traffic  or safety  benefits.\n            Finally,     although    an     Avoidance\n            Alternative,   designed   to  avoid   all\n            protected   Section  4(f)   resources  on\n            Jamestown Island, was feasible, the FSEIS\n            determined  that  it   was  not   prudent\n            because  of  \"a   number  of   disruptive\n            consequences  involved  in  this  or  any\n            alternative that avoids the Windmill Hill\n            Historic  District.\"   Although  it found\n            that  Alternative  A1  caused  the  least\n            impact  to  the  historic  district,  the\n            Rhode   Island  Historical   Preservation\n            Commission recognized that the separation\n            of  through  and  local traffic  achieved\n            with    Alternative     B    necessitated\n            considering this  alternative even though\n            it  had  greater short-term  Section 4(f)\n            impacts.   The  1987 FSEIS  ROD concluded\n            that there  was  no prudent  or  feasible\n            alternative to the use  of land from  the\n            Windmill   Hill  Historic   District  and\n            Alternative   B  included   all  possible\n            planning to minimize harm  resulting from\n            such use. \n\n               On June 8,  1988, FHWA authorized  the\n            acquisition  of  parcels  to establish  a\n            right-of-way  along  Eldred  Avenue  from\n            Seaside   Drive  to   North  Road.     By\n            November 7, 1990, RIDOT  had acquired  at\n            least 143 of the 202 parcels necessary to\n            build the Jamestown Connector.\n\n               In  October,  1986 RIDOT  submitted to\n            the  Corps  the  first  of  a  series  of\n            applications for a permit for the filling\n            of  wetlands  in   connection  with   the\n            Jamestown  Connector.   (Plaintiffs' Exh.\n\n                               -11-\n\n            22 and 23.)   Although the Corps issued a\n            public notice regarding its permit review\n            for    the    Jamestown   Connector    on\n            November 29, 1990, no public  hearing was\n            held  in  connection   with  the   permit\n            application.   On May 22, 1992, the Corps\n            completed  an  Environmental   Assessment\n            (\"EA\") and statement  of findings for the\n            purposes of issuing a Section  404 permit\n            to fill wetlands.  The EA \"considered all\n            factors   relevant   to  th[e]   proposal\n            including   cumulative  effects.\"     The\n            environmental     assessment    minimized\n            wetlands  impacts  by replacing  the Helm\n            Street  overpass with a  frontage road to\n            address  local access concerns.  Based on\n            the  evaluation of  environmental effects\n            discussed  in the  1987 FSEIS,  the Corps\n            determined  that  the  \"decision on  [the\n            Section  404]  application  [was]  not  a\n            major   federal    action   significantly\n            affecting  the  quality   of  the   human\n            environment\"  and  therefore required  no\n            separate environmental  impact statement.\n            The  Corps  concluded that  Alternative B\n            without the Helm  Street overpass was the\n            least       environmentally      damaging\n            practicable alternative.  As a result, on\n            May 21,  1992, the  Corps issued  a final\n            Section 404 permit  authorizing RIDOT  to\n            fill approximately 4.6 acres  of wetlands\n            to construct the Jamestown Connector.\n\n               Throughout  and  following  the  Corps\n            permit   approval   process,   the   JDSC\n            continued  to  hold periodic  meetings to\n            evaluate additional proposed  refinements\n            to the Jamestown Connector  design.  In a\n            JDSC  meeting held on May 7, 1992, Thomas\n            Todd,   an    architect   and   Jamestown\n            resident, presented an alternative design\n            featuring    an   at-grade,    signalized\n            intersection  at  the crossing  of Eldred\n            Avenue  and  North   Road.    Mr.  Todd's\n            conceptual  layout   incuded  two  travel\n            lanes in each direction and separate left\n            and right turn lanes along Eldred Avenue.\n            Minutes  of the meeting  reflect that Mr.\n            Todd  also  had  contacted the  Jamestown\n            Police and  had been informed  that there\n            had  been  213  accidents  (78  involving\n            injury)  on Route  138 in  Jamestown over\n\n                               -12-\n\n            the previous five  year period.   Records\n            at   the   Newport   Bridge  Toll   Plaza\n            indicated  that approximately  31 million\n            trips had been  made over that  same time\n            period.  At  the same  meeting, the  JDSC\n            formed an architectural review committee,\n            with Mr. Todd as a member.  Over the next\n            six  months,  RIDOT incorporated  certain\n            profile  and   architectural  adjustments\n            suggested  by  the  architectural  review\n            committee  into  the Jamestown  Connector\n            design.\n\n               FHWA   conditionally    approved   the\n            receipt   of   bids  for   the  Jamestown\n            Connector on July  31, 1992.   Plaintiffs\n            commenced this action on October 8, 1992.\n            RIDOT  opened  bids  for   the  Jamestown\n            Connector on December 11, 1992.  On April\n            21,  1993,  RIDOT  issued  a  conditional\n            notice   to  proceed   with  construction\n            activity   to   its  contractor,   Tilcon\n            Gammino.   After final notice  to proceed\n            was given, construction began on  May 13,\n            1993.   On May 21, 1993, plaintiffs moved\n            for a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\")\n            to  enjoin further construction.   On May\n            25, 1993, this court  granted plaintiffs'\n            TRO application  which restrained further\n            construction activity within the frontage\n            road area along Eldred Avenue.  The court\n            vacated   the  TRO   on  June   8,  1993.\n            Defendants   have    moved   to   dismiss\n            plaintiffs'  Clean Air Act claim for lack\n            of  jurisdiction and  failure to  state a\n            claim  upon which relief  can be granted.\n            Plaintiffs,  in  turn,  have   moved  for\n            summary judgment  on their Clean  Air Act\n            and  Intermodal   Surface  Transportation\n            Efficiency  Act  claims.   Because  these\n            motions  raise   substantially  the  same\n            issues  as  plaintiffs'  application  for\n            preliminary injunction,  the court defers\n            ruling on  them and considers  all claims\n            under    the    preliminary    injunction\n            standard.\n\nConservation Law  Found. v.

For the\n\nfollowing  reasons, we  uphold the  district court's  findings in\n\nthis case.\n\n                         A.  NEPA CLAIMS\n                                        \n\n                               -14-\n\n          1.  Logical Termini\n\n          The district  court found  that none of  the defendants\n\nviolated its respective obligations  under NEPA to prepare proper\n\nEnvironmental   Impact  Statements  (\"EISs\")  for  the  Jamestown\n\nConnector  highway project.   In  particular, the  court rejected\n\nplaintiffs' argument that the defendants unlawfully segmented the\n\ngeographic area of analysis  in the 1987 Jamestown  Connector EIS\n\n(\"Jamestown FSEIS\")  and that  defendants failed to  consider the\n\ncumulative impacts  of highway projects  all along the  Route 138\n\nCorridor.\n\n          Federal  Highway  Administration  (\"FHWA\")  regulations\n\nprovide that an EIS is of proper geographic scope if the  project\n\nit analyzes connects \"logical termini,\" has \"independent utility\"\n\nand does not restrict \"consideration of alternatives.\"  23 C.F.R.\n\n  771.111(f).    The  district  court found  that  the  Jamestown\n\nConnector project satisfied all three criteria  and, as a result,\n\nthe  1987  Jamestown FSEIS  was of  the  appropriate scope.   The\n\nplaintiffs take issue only with  the court's determination of the\n\nfirst prong (the so-called \"logical termini\" prong).\n\n          \"Termini\" include crossroads, population centers, major\n\ntraffic generators, or similar highway control elements.  37 Fed.\n\nReg. 21,810.   The district court found  that the two bridges  on\n\neach  side  of  the  Jamestown Connector  (entering  and  exiting\n\nJamestown  island)  are  logical  enough termini  to  uphold  the\n\nagencies'   determination  that  the   connector  was   a  proper\n\ngeographic area  for environmental analysis.   In particular, the\n\n                               -15-\n\ncourt accepted defendants' argument  that the bridges are traffic\n\ngenerators or traffic control devices.\n\n          Plaintiffs contend  that the bridges do  not qualify as\n\n\"crossroads\" or  \"traffic  generators,\" but  instead  are  merely\n\nindistinguishable strips of the highway that happen  to pass over\n\nwater.   According to the plaintiffs, because most traffic merely\n\npasses over the bridges and through the island on its  way to and\n\nfrom cities  in Connecticut  and Massachusetts, and  to and  from\n\nvarious highway interchanges that  are located several miles away\n\nfrom  the bridges,  the  bridges themselves  neither control  nor\n\ngenerate any traffic but merely carry it.   Thus, the bridges are\n\nallegedly  not  a  \"beginning  or  end\"  such  that   they  could\n\nreasonably be considered \"termini.\"\n\n          Plaintiffs present a strong  argument, but, given  that\n\nwe  are reviewing this case for an abuse of discretion, we cannot\n\nfind that the  district court  erred in  upholding the  agencies'\n\ndetermination of termini.

Brinegar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"339199\"><a href=\"/opinion/339199/timothy-w-swain-and-katherine-a-swain-v-claude-s-brinegar-individually/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                                 \n\n369 (7th  Cir. 1976)  (\"The task  of the court  is not  to decide\n\nwhere to  draw the line,  but to  review the matter  to ascertain\n\nwhether  the agency has made a reasonable choice.\").  The bridges\n\nmay  not \"control\" or \"generate\"  traffic in the  strict sense of\n\nthose words, but they do represent the only way that cars can get\n\nonto  and off  of  the island.    Thus, traffic  passing  through\n\nsouthern  Rhode  Island  is   controlled  by  the  existence  and\n\ncondition  of those bridges.   Although the  FHWA is  not free to\n\nconsider  every bridge  or culvert  in a highway  system to  be a\n\n                               -16-\n\nsuitable end  point for purposes of conducting  EIS analysis, two\n\nbridges  over  Narragansett Bay,  a  considerably  large body  of\n\nwater,  can  reasonably  constitute  a   major  \"highway  control\n\nelement.\"   37 Fed. Reg. 21,810.  Ultimately, when viewed through\n\nthe lens  of basic common sense, two bridges on either side of an\n\nisland appear to be perfectly logical termini to us.\n\n          None  of   the  authorities  cited  by  the  plaintiffs\n\nindicates that \"logical termini\"  must be located at interchanges\n\nor  major metropolitan  areas.   We  do  not believe  that  those\n\ndecisions which  found indistinguishable strips of  highway to be\n\nimproper termini for EIS purposes apply to the present case.

They  do not take issue with  the substance\n\nof the analysis  in these reports or with the thoroughness of the\n\nenvironmental  review  conducted  by  the  defendants.   Instead,\n\nplaintiffs challenge the geographic  scope of the area considered\n\nin those reports,  arguing that  because parts of  the Route  138\n\ncorridor were left out of the various EISs, their analyses cannot\n\nbe  completely cumulative.  They claim that the 1984 FEIS did not\n\nanalyze  proposed  actions for  the  Route 138  corridor  east of\n\nWashington County  (which is  basically the Newport  Rhode Island\n\narea where the  highway continues east of  Jamestown Island after\n\ncrossing the eastern bridge off the island).  While the 1979 DEIS\n\ndid analyze this area, it did not consider the exact same highway\n\nroutes and projects that are presently contemplated for  the area\n\n(i.e., the  original  projects  for that  area  have  since  been\n     \n\ndiscarded).  Consequently, plaintiffs  point out that neither EIS\n\n                    \n\nprojects.  We think  it is reasonable, and plaintiffs  present no\ncaselaw to the contrary, for agencies to consider  prior studies,\ndraft  or otherwise,  in  their  EISs  and  to  include  them  by\nreference.\n\n                               -20-\n\nanalyzed two  of the  six  projects listed  within the  Jamestown\n\nFSEIS as part of  the Route 138 corridor (the  Newport Circulator\n\nand East Main Road upgrade).2\n\n          For  us, the bottom line  is that the relevant agencies\n\nconducted  an analysis  of  the environmental  impact of  highway\n\nconstruction  projects along Route 138.   The 1979  and 1984 EISs\n\ncontain in-depth discussions  (300 pages worth  in the 1979  DEIS\n\nand  200  pages in  the  1984  FEIS)  covering  a wide  range  of\n\nenvironmental  concerns surrounding  highway construction  in the\n\narea of Route  138.  For its part, the Jamestown FSEIS explicitly\n\nreferenced the two prior EISs  and placed the Jamestown connector\n\nin  the context of  the entire Route  138 corridor project.   The\n\n1979  and 1984  EISs  may not  have  covered precisely  the  same\n\ngeographical  areas  or  projects  that are  now  being  built or\n\nproposed in  conjunction with  the Jamestown Connector,  but they\n\ndid sufficiently  consider the  incremental impact  of individual\n\n                    \n\n2  Plaintiffs also claim that the 1984 FEIS \"deferred analysis of\nthe  Jamestown  Connector,\"  by  noting several  times  that  the\nprocess for deciding on the construction design and route for the\nJamestown  Connector was  ongoing and  that no decision  had been\nmade.    Therefore,  plaintiffs  argue, the  1984  FEIS  did  not\nproperly  consider the  cumulative impact  of all  projects taken\ntogether in its environmental analysis.  This argument strikes us\nas a red  herring.  The 1984 FEIS clearly  contemplated some kind\nof  highway construction  between  the two  bridges on  Jamestown\nIsland  and it explicitly discussed the fact that a more in-depth\nenvironmental study of the island would be done in a supplemental\nEIS.  A full  description of the environment on  Jamestown island\nwas  included  in  the  1984  FEIS.    The  Jamestown  FSEIS  was\nsubsequently  written as a supplement  to the 1984  FEIS and both\nEISs  contemplated  that the  two would  be  read together.   The\ndistrict  court  found  this  to  be  sufficient  to satisfy  the\ncumulative impact  analysis requirement  and we see  no abuse  of\ndiscretion in this ruling.\n\n                               -21-\n\nsections  of Route  138 construction \"when  added to  other past,\n\npresent and  reasonably foreseeable future actions.\"  40 C.F.R.  \n\n1508.7.   We therefore do  not believe the  district court abused\n\nits discretion  in rejecting the plaintiffs'  contention that the\n\naforementioned discrepancies in the EISs violated NEPA.\n\n          Plaintiffs  nevertheless  maintain  that  even  if  the\n\ncombined  analyses contained  in all  the EISs  constitute proper\n\ncumulative  impact review, the process of referencing them in the\n\nJamestown  FSEIS  does not  comport  with  the cumulative  impact\n\nrequirements  in   the  CEQ   regulations.    According   to  the\n\nplaintiffs, a  particular EIS cannot incorporate  the findings of\n\nother  EISs unless it  is part of  a proper \"tiering\"  process as\n\nprovided for in 23 C.F.R.   771.111(g).  Under   777.111(g):\n\n            For  major  transportation  actions,  the\n            tiering  of EISs as  discussed in the CEQ\n            regulation (40  C.F.R.   1502.20)  may be\n            appropriate.   The  first tier  EIS would\n            focus on broad issues  . . . . The second\n            tier would  address site-specific details\n            . . . .\n\nThe  district court found the \"tiering\" of the Jamestown FSEIS on\n\ntop of the 1984 FEIS and 1979 DEIS to be proper in this case.\n\n          Plaintiffs claim this finding is erroneous because: (1)\n\nthe 1979  DEIS was just a  draft having no legal  effect; (2) the\n\n1984 FEIS did not qualify as a programmatic evaluation upon which\n\nsmaller  projects could be tiered; and (3) the Route 138 Corridor\n\nis  not a  sufficiently large,  wide-ranging federal  project for\n\nwhich tiering is appropriate.\n\n          Although the plaintiffs are  correct that the 1979 DEIS\n\n                               -22-\n\nhas  no legal effect  and cannot, by  itself, serve as  the first\n\ntier in the  EIS process,  nothing that the  plaintiffs point  to\n\nprecludes  a final  EIS from  referring to  the reports  and data\n\ncontained  in  a draft  EIS  to  analyze  cumulative  impacts  of\n\ngovernmental actions.  Thus, the information in the 1979 DEIS can\n\nbe  considered a part of the cumulative impact analysis for Route\n\n138.\n\n          The plaintiffs further argue that the 1984 FEIS was not\n\nsufficiently  comprehensive to  constitute  a programmatic  first\n\ntier that can support the second tier in the Jamestown FSEIS.  To\n\nsupport  this  contention,  plaintiffs  basically  restate  their\n\nearlier argument that  the 1984  FEIS failed to  analyze all  the\n\nproposed projects  along  the  entire Route  138  corridor.    To\n\nbriefly restate our rejection of this argument, the 1984 FEIS not\n\nonly addressed the Route 138 corridor in a comprehensive fashion,\n\nit explicitly contemplated that a supplemental EIS, the Jamestown\n\nFSEIS, would be prepared in conjunction with the larger  EIS.  We\n\nsee  no abuse  of  discretion  in finding  this  to be  a  proper\n\napplication of the tiering  regulations.

Likewise,   the  FHWA  may   not  approve  a\n\ntransportation  project  under      4(f)  of  the  Department  of\n\nTransportation Act  which encroaches on a  National Historic Site\n\nunless no \"prudent and feasible\" alternative exists.\n\n          Plaintiffs  claim  that  the district  court  erred  in\n\ncrediting  the determination of the Corps and the FHWA that there\n\nwere   no  practicable  alternative   designs  to  the  Jamestown\n\nConnector  project.    Specifically,  plaintiffs  argue  that the\n\nagencies failed to  consider the so-called \"Todd design\" which is\n\nidentical to the design  actually chosen (the FHWA and  the Corps\n\nchose \"Alternative  B\") except that  a stoplight and  an at-grade\n\nintersection  would  replace a  proposed overpass  at one  of the\n\nmajor intersections on the island.\n\n          Although the defendants did not explicitly consider the\n\nTodd design itself, the  district court found that the  Corps and\n\nthe FHWA  did consider the main feature of the Todd design -- the\n\n                    \n\nway casting serious doubt on the validity of the district court's\nholding.\n\n4  40 C.F.R.   230.10(a)(2) provides that:\n\n            An  alternative is  practicable if  it is\n            available  and  capable  of  being  done,\n            after  taking  into  consideration  cost,\n            existing  technology,  and  logistics  in\n            light of overall project purposes.\n\n                               -26-\n\nat-grade  intersection  in place  of  the overpass  --  when they\n\nevaluated  two  other  alternatives   (Alternatives  A  and  A1).\n\nPlaintiffs  object to this because Alternatives  A and A1 involve\n\nan  unlimited access road and  other features not  present in the\n\nTodd design.   Therefore,  plaintiffs contend, the  conclusion by\n\nthe  defendant agencies  that  Alternatives  A  and  A1  are  not\n\npracticable because they  involve significant traffic  congestion\n\nand safety hazards  does not necessarily apply to  an alternative\n\nthat  removes all the traffic  hazards with the  exception of one\n\nstoplight at a major intersection.\n\n          This  is a valid  objection, but plaintiffs' contention\n\ndoes not justify a finding of an abuse of discretion or  manifest\n\nerror  of law.  Technical  discrepancies may have existed between\n\nalternatives  actually considered  and an  alternative  which, if\n\nconsidered,  may have been found to be more practicable.  The two\n\nalternatives considered,  however, were somewhat similar  in that\n\nthey  both contained an element of  major concern to the Corps --\n\nan at-grade  intersection which could lead  to traffic congestion\n\nand safety problems.  This similarity is sufficient to render the\n\nCorps' substantive analysis acceptable.\n\n          Plaintiffs also  argue that because two other agencies,\n\nthe Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") and the U.S. Fish and\n\nWildlife Service  (\"FWS\"), criticized  the FHWA's  conclusions in\n\nthe 1987 FSEIS, the  Corps could not \"blindly rely\" on the FHWA's\n\nconclusion  that  Alternative  B  was  the least  environmentally\n\ndamaging practicable  alternative.  As the  district court points\n\n                               -27-\n\nout, however, the Corps did not \"blindly rely\" on the 1987 FSEIS.\n\nRather, the Corps supplemented the FHWA's evaluation with its own\n\nadministrative record, studies, and responses  to public comment.\n\nThe district court's finding is not an abuse of discretion.\n\n          Finally,    4(f) of the DOT requires that the FHWA must\n\nundertake all  possible planning  to minimize harm  to historical\n\nsites.    Plaintiffs  argue  that  the  Todd  design  alternative\n\nconstitutes an example of  required planning which would minimize\n\nsuch harm.  Under   4(f), agency determinations that a particular\n\nplan  minimizes harm  to  historical sites  deserve even  greater\n\ndeference  than  agency  determinations   concerning  practicable\n\nalternatives.

The defendants\n           \n\nclaim  that the  language of  the citizen  suit provision  of the\n\nClean  Air Act, 42 U.S.C.   7604(a)(1), which authorizes suits to\n\nenforce  violations  of  an  \"emission  standard or  limitation,\"\n\nlimits such  suits to  cases involving standards  and limitations\n\nset  in a state implementation plan or  standards set by the EPA.\n\nBecause the  present  suit does  not involve  the enforcement  of\n\nstandards set out in  a state or EPA plan,  defendants argue that\n\nthe  district   court  had   no  jurisdiction  to   consider  the\n\nplaintiffs' claims in the first place.  We disagree.\n\n          Under CAA's  citizen  suit provision,  any  person  may\n\ncommence  a civil  action to enforce  violations of  an \"emission\n\nstandard or  limitation under  this chapter.\"   42  U.S.C.   7604\n\n(a)(1).  The term \"emission standard or limitation\" is defined by\n\n42 U.S.C.   7604(f) as a \"standard  of performance . . . which is\n\nin  effect  under  this chapter  .  . .  or  under  an applicable\n                                           \n\nimplementation plan.\"5 (emphasis added).   According to its plain\n\n                    \n\n5  Defendants' use  of the definition for \"emissions  standard or\nlimitation\"  provided  in  42  U.S.C.    7602(k)  (a  requirement\n\"established by the State  or Administrator\") is improper because\n\n                               -29-\n\nlanguage, this  section includes  \"standards of  performance\" set\n\nout  in  the  Act  itself.   The  specific  statutory  provisions\n\nenumerated in   7604(f)(3) are  not the only statutory provisions\n\nthat can be enforced  under the citizen suit provision.   Rather,\n\nas  long  as  the  claimed  violation  involves  a  \"standard  of\n\nperformance\" \"under\" the CAA, the court has jurisdiction pursuant\n\nto   7604(f)(1), even though  the standard is not imposed  by the\n\nstatutory sections enumerated in   7604(f)(3).\n\n          In   this   case,   plaintiffs  are   challenging   the\n\ndefendants'  violation  of the  CAA  conformity  requirements, 42\n\nU.S.C.    7506 (c)(1)  &amp;  (c)(3), which  mandate that  defendants\n\ndemonstrate that their  transportation projects \"would contribute\n\nto annual  emissions reductions  consistent with\" the  levels set\n\nout  in     7511a(b)(1)  and     7512a(a)(7).   These  conformity\n\nrequirements  plainly   constitute  an  emissions   \"standard  of\n\nperformance\" as that  term is defined in 42 U.S.C.    7602(l) (\"a\n\nrequirement  of  continuous  emission  reduction,  including  any\n\nrequirement relating to the operation  or maintenance of a source\n\nto assure  continuous emission reduction\").   Therefore,  because\n\nthe citizen suit provision allows for suits to enforce \"standards\n\nof  performance,\"   42  U.S.C.     7604(f)(1),   this  court  has\n\njurisdiction over plaintiffs'  CAA claims.

The\n\nchallenged governmental actions  include the FHWA's authorization\n\nof  construction on the Jamestown  Connector in July  of 1992 and\n\nthe Corps'  issuance of a permit to fill wetlands in May of 1992.\n\nThe  defendants also adopted and  approved the TIP  and the Plan,\n\nactions which the plaintiffs also challenge.\n\n          The district  court found: (1) that  Rhode Island's TIP\n\nand  Plan conformed with the requirements of the CAA because they\n\ncontributed   to  annual  emissions  reductions  consistent  with\n\n  7511a(b)(1);  and (2) that, regardless, the Jamestown Connector\n\nproject was not subject to further conformity review  pursuant to\n\nregulations in effect at the time of approval.  23 C.F.R.   770.9\n\n(d)(3) (w/drawn Dec. 22, 1992, 57 Fed. Reg. 60,725).\n\n          For purposes of the present  litigation, which involves\n\nconstruction on the Jamestown Connector, we need not consider the\n\nconformity  of Rhode  Island's TIP  and Plan  to the  extent this\n\n                               -33-\n\nissue  does  not effect  the  status of  the  Jamestown Connector\n\nproject itself.   Because the district court's  second finding is\n\ndispositive  in this case,  we do not reach  the issues raised in\n\nthe court's first finding.\n\n          Plaintiffs  claim  that  the  regulation  found  by the\n\ndistrict court  to insulate the Jamestown  Connector from further\n\nconformity review, 23 C.F.R.   770.9(d)(3),  does nothing to stop\n\nthe  ban on federal support of nonconforming projects provided in\n\n  7506(c)  as part  of  the 1990  CAA  Amendments.   (Again,  the\n\nchallenged   actions  include   the   FHWA's   authorization   of\n\nconstruction and the Corps' issuance of a permit to fill wetlands\n\nin 1992).  According  to the plaintiffs, the 1990  CAA Amendments\n\neither  trump the effect of the regulation or simply provide new,\n\nindependent  conformity requirements  that  must  be  met  before\n\nfederal  action can be taken  on any project,  regardless of that\n\nproject's own conformity status.   In other words,  the Jamestown\n\nConnector may  itself conform to the CAA, but the TIP and Plan do\n\nnot, so the government is  barred from taking any actions  in the\n\nentire state, including actions for the Jamestown Connector.\n\n          Specifically,  plaintiffs  read      7506(c)(3)(B)7  to\n\n                    \n\n7  42  U.S.C.    7506(c)(3)(B) provides, in  relevant part,  that\nconformity  of transportation  projects  will be  demonstrated if\nthey:\n\n            (i) come from a conforming transportation\n            plan   and   program   as    defined   in\n            subparagraph (A) or  for 12 months  after\n            November 15, 1990, from  a transportation\n            program  found to conform  within 3 years\n            prior to such date of enactment.\n\n                               -34-\n\nmandate  that  no  transportation  project  may  receive  federal\n                 \n\nfunding or  support unless  the project  comes from  a conforming\n\nPlan  and TIP as defined  in 7506(c)(3)(A) or,  until November of\n\n1991,  from a  plan or  program found to  conform within  3 years\n\nprior  to November 15,  1990.  The  issue before us  is whether  \n\n7506(c)(3) applies to all projects regardless of their status, or\n\njust  to  projects  that   have  yet  to  receive   a  conformity\n\ndetermination as of November, 1990.\n\n          Without delving  into statutory  minutiae -- and,  as a\n\nconsequence,  declining  the parties'  invitation  to  engage the\n\nbattle  of dueling legislative histories -- we believe that it is\n\ncertainly  reasonable  for  the  district  court  to (implicitly)\n\ninterpret  the grace  period provision  in    7506(c)(3)(B)(i) as\n\napplying  only prospectively and  not to  past projects  like the\n\nJamestown Connector.   First of all,   7506(c)(3)(B) does not say\n\nthat  no project can receive federal support unless it comes from\n\na  conforming transportation  plan.   Instead,  the grace  period\n\nsentence relied on by the plaintiffs,   7506(c)(3)(B)(i), is part\n\nof a provision explaining the manner in which the \"conformity\" of\n\nplans, TIPs and projects will be demonstrated for purposes of the\n\nrestriction in   7506(c)(1).  Plans whose conformity  has already\n\nbeen demonstrated do  not appear  to fall under  the auspices  of\n\nthis provision.  The grace period in 7506(c)(3)(B)(i) talks about\n\nprojects that \"come from  . . . a transportation program found to\n                                                        \n\nconform within 3 years prior to\" November 1991.   It says nothing\n\nabout  the project itself being found to conform during the prior\n\n                               -35-\n\n3 years.  Consequently, the provision seems specifically aimed at\n\nprojects  whose conformity had yet to be demonstrated by the time\n\nthe 1990  Amendments took effect.8   The Jamestown  Connector was\n\nfound to conform in 1988 at the latest (by means  of the approval\n\nof the Jamestown FSEIS) and we  see no indication in   7506(c)(3)\n\nthat Congress intended to abrogate this determination.\n\n          Furthermore,  the language  of    7506(c)(3)  -- \"Until\n\nsuch time as the implementation plan  revision . . . is approved,\n\nconformity  of   such  plans,  programs  and   projects  will  be\n\ndemonstrated  if .  . .\" --  sounds like  it is  referring to the\n\n\"interim  period,\" that is, the time between the enactment of the\n\nAmendments and the adoption of the new SIPs.  Thus, a prospective\n\napplication  of the provision seems particularly appropriate and,\n\nconversely, a retroactive application particularly inappropriate.\n\nThis interpretation  of   7506(c)(3) has  apparently been adopted\n\nby the  EPA and the  Department of  Transportation.  See  June 7,\n                                                        \n\nEnvironmental  Protection  Agency  and  Dept.  of  Transportation\n                                                                 \n\nGuidance  for  Determining  Conformity of  Transportation  Plans,\n                                                                 \n\nPrograms  and Projects  With Clean  Air Act  Implementation Plans\n                                                                 \n\nDuring Phase  I of the Interim Period, June 7, 1991 at 22-23, 24-\n                                     \n\n                    \n\n8  For this reason, the plaintiffs' argument that the defendants'\ninterpretation of    7506(c)(3)(B)(i)  would make  that provision\nsuperfluous  is specious.   Presumably,  there existed  plenty of\nprojects in  1990 that  were not as  far along  as the  Jamestown\nConnector and had not yet received a conformity determination, as\ndid  Jamestown, prior to the 1990 Amendments.  Those projects may\nhave \"come  from\" conforming Plans  and TIPs  at the time  of the\nAmendments,  but  the projects  themselves had  yet to  receive a\ndetermination  of conformity.  As  a result, the  grace period in\n  7506(c)(3)(B)(i)  was   enacted  to  address   these  types  of\nprojects.\n\n                               -36-\n\n25 (interpreting   7506(c)(3) to apply only to projects that have\n\nyet to receive conformity determinations);  see also 58 Fed. Reg.\n                                                    \n\n62190-91  (EPA  and   Department  of  Transportation  regulations\n\nholding    that   its   Interim   Guidance   governs   conformity\n\ndeterminations  made  between  1990  and  1993).     It  is  well\n\nestablished that we afford  considerable deference to an agency's\n\ninterpretation of a  statute that  it is  primarily charged  with\n\nenforcing, especially  a complicated  one like the  CAA.
