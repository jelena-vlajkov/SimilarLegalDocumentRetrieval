The plaintiffs are two minors\r                    TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.\r                                          \r\n\nand their parents.  The minors allege that they were compelled to\r\n\nattend an  indecent AIDS and  sex education program  conducted at\r\n\ntheir  public  high school  by  defendant  Hot,  Sexy  and  Safer\r\n\nProductions (\"Hot,  Sexy, and Safer\").   Plaintiffs allege, inter\r                                                                           \r\n\nalia, that  the compelled attendance deprived the minors of their\r              \r\n\nprivacy rights and their right to an educational environment free\r\n\nfrom  sexual   harassment.    The  district   court  granted  the\r\n\ndefendants'  motion  to  dismiss  under  Federal  Rule  of  Civil\r\n\nProcedure 12(b)(6).  We affirm.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The  plaintiffs  are  Chelmsford High  School  students\r\n\nJason P. Mesiti (\"Mesiti\") and Shannon Silva (\"Silva\"), and their\r\n\nparents  Ronald and Suzanne  Brown (\"the Browns\"),  and Carol and\r\n\nRichard Dubreuil  (\"the Dubreuils\").   The  plaintiffs' complaint\r\n\nalleges the following facts,  which we take as true  for purposes\r\n\nof this  appeal.  On April  8, 1992, Mesiti and  Silva attended a\r\n\nmandatory,  school-wide  \"assembly\"  at Chelmsford  High  School.\r\n\nBoth students were  fifteen years old at the time.   The assembly\r\n\nconsisted  of a  ninety-minute presentation characterized  by the\r\n\ndefendants as  an AIDS awareness  program (the  \"Program\").   The\r\n\nProgram  was staged  by defendant  Suzi Landolphi  (\"Landolphi\"),\r\n\ncontracting  through  defendant Hot,  Sexy,  and  Safer, Inc.,  a\r\n\ncorporation wholly owned by Landolphi.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs allege that Landolphi gave sexually explicit\r\n\nmonologues  and participated  in  sexually suggestive  skits with\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nseveral  minors  chosen from  the  audience.   Specifically,  the\r\n\ncomplaint alleges that Landolphi:  1) told the students that they\r\n\nwere  going to  have  a \"group  sexual experience,  with audience\r\n\nparticipation\"; 2) used profane, lewd, and lascivious language to\r\n\ndescribe  body parts  and excretory  functions; 3)  advocated and\r\n\napproved  oral sex, masturbation, homosexual sexual activity, and\r\n\ncondom  use  during  promiscuous  premarital  sex;  4)  simulated\r\n\nmasturbation;  5) characterized the loose pants worn by one minor\r\n\nas \"erection wear\";  6) referred  to being in  \"deep sh--\"  after\r\n\nanal sex; 7) had a male minor lick an oversized  condom with her,\r\n\nafter which  she had a female minor pull it over the male minor's\r\n\nentire head and blow it up; 8) encouraged a male minor to display\r\n\nhis \"orgasm face\"  with her  for the camera;  9) informed a  male\r\n\nminor  that  he  was  not  having  enough  orgasms;  10)  closely\r\n\ninspected a minor and told him he had a \"nice butt\"; and 11) made\r\n\neighteen references to orgasms,  six references to male genitals,\r\n\nand eight references to female genitals.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs maintain  that the sexually  explicit nature\r\n\nof  Landolphi's speech  and  behavior humiliated  and intimidated\r\n\nMesiti  and Silva.   Moreover,  many students  copied Landolphi's\r\n\nroutines and  generally displayed overtly sexual  behavior in the\r\n\nweeks following  the Program, allegedly exacerbating  the minors'\r\n\nharassment.  The  complaint does  not allege that  either of  the\r\n\nminor plaintiffs  actually participated in  any of the  skits, or\r\n\nwere the direct objects of any of Landolphi's comments.\r\n\n          The complaint names eight co-defendants along with Hot,\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nSexy, and Safer,  and Landolphi, alleging  that each played  some\r\n\nrole in planning, sponsoring, producing, and compelling the minor\r\n\nplaintiffs' attendance at the Program.  In March  1992, defendant\r\n\nJudith Hass  (\"Hass\"), then chairperson of  the Chelmsford Parent\r\n\nTeacher Organization  (the  \"PTO\"), initiated  negotiations  with\r\n\nHot, Sexy,  and Safer.   Hass  and  defendant Michael  Gilchrist,\r\n\nM.D., also a member of the PTO, as well as  the school physician,\r\n\nviewed a  promotional videotape  of segments of  Landolphi's past\r\n\nperformances  and  then recommended  the  Program  to the  school\r\n\nadministration.    On  behalf  of   defendant  Chelmsford  School\r\n\nCommittee  (the \"School Committee\"),  Hass executed  an agreement\r\n\nwith Hot, Sexy, and  Safer, and authorized the release  of $1,000\r\n\nof Chelmsford school funds to pay Landolphi's fee.\r\n\n          The  complaint  also  names  as  defendants  two  other\r\n\nmembers of the School Committee, Wendy Marcks and Mary E. Frantz,\r\n\nas well as the Superintendent and Assistant Superintendent of the\r\n\nChelmsford  Public  Schools,  Richard  H.  Moser,  and  David  S.\r\n\nTroughton, and the Principal of Chelmsford High School, George J.\r\n\nBetses.   Plaintiffs allege that all  the defendants participated\r\n\nin the decisions to hire Landolphi, and to compel the students to\r\n\nattend  the Program.  All the  defendants were physically present\r\n\nduring the Program.\r\n\n          A  school  policy  adopted   by  the  School  Committee\r\n\nrequired   \"[p]ositive   subscription,   with  written   parental\r\n\npermission\"  as   a   prerequisite  to   \"instruction  in   human\r\n\nsexuality.\"   The  plaintiffs allege,  however, that  the parents\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nwere not given advance notice of the content of the Program or an\r\n\nopportunity  to  excuse their  children  from  attendance at  the\r\n\nassembly.\r\n\n          The   district  court  granted  defendants'  motion  to\r\n\ndismiss plaintiffs' complaint, pursuant  to Federal Rule of Civil\r\n\nProcedure  12(b)(6), for  failure  to state  a  claim upon  which\r\n\nrelief  may be granted, and  also dismissed the  state law claims\r\n\nunder  the supplemental  jurisdiction principles  of 28  U.S.C.  \r\n\n1367.1   The  district court  deferred entry  of final  judgment,\r\n\ngiving plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint curative  of\r\n\nthe deficiencies by February  10, 1995.  Plaintiffs failed  to do\r\n\nso, and final judgment  was entered on March 3,  1995, dismissing\r\n\ntheir claims. \r\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\n          We  exercise de  novo  review over  a district  court's\r                                         \r\n\ndismissal  of a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).

We accept the\r                    \r\n\nallegations  of the  complaint  as true,  and determine  whether,\r\n\nunder any theory, the allegations are sufficient to state a cause\r\n\nof action in accordance with the law.

The  Supreme  Court   has\r\n\nexplained that: \"A necessary  concomitant to the determination of\r\n\nwhether  the  constitutional right  asserted  by  a plaintiff  is\r\n\n'clearly established'  at the  time  the defendant  acted is  the\r\n\ndetermination of  whether the plaintiff has  asserted a violation\r\n\nof a constitutional right at all.\"   Siegert v.

We  need not decide here whether  the right\r\n\nto  rear one's children is fundamental because we find that, even\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nif  it  were,  the  plaintiffs  have  failed  to  demonstrate  an\r\n\nintrusion of constitutional magnitude on this right.5\r\n\n          The  Meyer  and  Pierce  cases, we  think,  evince  the\r                                           \r\n\nprinciple  that the state cannot  prevent parents from choosing a\r\n\nspecific  educational   program  --  whether   it  be   religious\r\n\ninstruction  at a  private  school or  instruction  in a  foreign\r\n\nlanguage.    That  is,  the state  does  not  have  the power  to\r\n\n\"standardize  its children\"  or \"foster  a homogenous  people\" by\r\n\ncompletely foreclosing the opportunity  of individuals and groups\r\n\nto choose a different path of education.

Indeed, the  opinions indicate that something less  than the\r\ncurrent  \"compelling  state  interest\"  test  was  then  used  to\r\nevaluate a substantive due process challenge involving one of the\r\nlisted liberty interests:  \"The established doctrine is that this\r\nliberty may not be interfered with, under the guise of protecting\r\nthe public  interest, by legislative action which is arbitrary or\r\nwithout reasonable relation to some purpose within the competency\r\nof the  State to effect.\"   Meyer, 262 U.S. at  399-400; see also\r                                                                           \r\nPierce, 268 U.S. at 535.\r                \r\n\n   Moreover,  it should be noted that these cases were decided in\r\nthe 1920's, before the  Bill of Rights was incorporated  into the\r\nFourteenth  Amendment, and  would  probably be  decided today  on\r\nFirst  Amendment   grounds.

We  think   it  is\r                                   \r\n\nfundamentally  different for the state  to say to  a parent, \"You\r\n\ncan't teach your child German or send him to a parochial school,\"\r\n\nthan for  the parent to  say to  the state, \"You  can't teach  my\r\n\nchild  subjects that  are morally  offensive to  me.\"   The first\r\n\ninstance involves  the state  proscribing parents from  educating\r\n\ntheir  children, while  the second  involves parents  prescribing\r\n\nwhat the state shall teach their  children.  If all parents had a\r\n\nfundamental constitutional right to dictate individually what the\r\n\nschools  teach their  children, the  schools would  be forced  to\r\n\ncater a  curriculum for each  student whose  parents had  genuine\r\n\nmoral disagreements  with the school's choice  of subject matter.\r\n\nWe  cannot see  that the  Constitution imposes  such a  burden on\r\n\nstate educational  systems, and accordingly find  that the rights\r\n\nof parents  as described by Meyer  and Pierce do not  encompass a\r                                                       \r\n\nbroad-based  right to  restrict the  flow  of information  in the\r\n\npublic schools.6  \r\n\n            2.

However,  the\r\ncourt's   holding   specifically    distinguished   the    condom\r\ndistribution program from exposure \"to  talk or literature on the\r\nsubject of sexual behavior,\" finding that  the latter claim would\r\n\"falter  in the  face of  the public  school's role  in preparing\r\nstudents  for participation in  a world replete  with complex and\r\ncontroversial issues.\"  Id. at 266.\r                                    \r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n          The  minor plaintiffs  maintain  that  the  defendants'\r\n\nconduct violated their privacy right to be free from \"exposure to\r\n\nvulgar and offensive language and obnoxiously debasing portrayals\r\n\nof human  sexuality.\"  Plaintiffs  cite no cases  -- and we  have\r\n\nfound  none -- indicating  that such a  fundamental privacy right\r\n\nexists.   Rather, they  attempt to  extract  the claimed  privacy\r\n\nright from the Supreme Court's First Amendment cases which uphold\r\n\nthe state's  limited power  to regulate or  discipline speech  to\r                     \r\n\nprotect  minors from offensive or vulgar speech.

As\r                                                \r\n\npreviously  discussed,  however,  the liberty  protected  by  the\r\n\nFourteenth Amendment does not  encompass a right to be  free from\r\n\nexposure to speech  which one  regards as offensive.   Thus,  the\r\n\nplaintiffs' asserted liberty interest, if one exists, must derive\r\n\nfrom state law.\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n          The plaintiffs  contend that  state law and  the School\r\n\nCommittee's  policy  on  \"Sex   Education\"  (the  \"Sex  Education\r\n\nPolicy\")  confers  a protected  liberty  interest,  and that  the\r\n\ndefendants'  actions deprived  them  of it  without due  process.\r\n\nSpecifically, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to\r\n\nfollow the school's Sex Education Policy, which provides:\r\n\n            The  Committee  believes that  the public\r\n            schools can best transmit  information on\r\n            human  sexuality  to   students  in   the\r\n            context    of   the    health   education\r\n            continuum.    Therefore, information  and\r\n            instructional  tools  appropriate to  the\r\n            age  group  will   be  used  to   include\r\n            instruction  in  human  sexuality in  the\r\n            curricular offerings on health.

The complaint further alleges that the parents\r\n\nwere not  given advance notice of the  contents of the Program or\r\n\nan opportunity to opt out.\r\n\n          Defendants concede  for the  purposes  of their  motion\r\n\nthat  the  Sex Education  Policy  confers a  liberty  interest in\r\n\nfreedom from exposure to  the content of the Program and in being\r\n\nafforded an opportunity to  opt out.8  They argue,  however, that\r\n\nthe  plaintiffs still fail to state a claim because the violation\r\n\nof the Sex Education  Policy was a \"random and  unauthorized\" act\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8  The plaintiffs also maintain that Mass.  Ann. Laws ch. 71,   1\r\n(1995) confers a protected liberty interest.  That statute grants\r\na  right to  opt out  from \"instruction  on disease\"  to students\r\nwhose  \"sincerely  held  religious  beliefs\"  conflict with  such\r\ninstruction.   Defendants assume for the  purposes of this appeal\r\nthat Mass. Gen.

The\r                                                  \r\n\nplaintiffs  maintain that their claim is more akin to that stated\r\n\nin  Zinermon, and is thus outside the scope of the Parratt-Hudson\r                                                                           \r\n\ndoctrine.\r\n\n          In Parratt,  a state prisoner  brought a    1983 action\r                              \r\n\nbecause prison  employees had  negligently lost materials  he had\r\n\nordered by mail.

As  the\r                                                \r\n\nCourt  explained, \"the loss is  not a result  of some established\r\n\nstate procedure and the State  cannot predict precisely when  the\r\n\nloss will  occur.

In addition, the Court has made clear\r                  \r\n\nthat unauthorized deprivations of  property by state employees do\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nnot  constitute  due  process  violations  under  the  Fourteenth\r\n\nAmendment  so long  as  meaningful  postdeprivation remedies  are\r\n\navailable.   Id. at 128-30.   Moreover, the  Court has emphasized\r                         \r\n\nthat \"no matter how significant the private interest at stake and\r\n\nthe  risk  of  its  erroneous deprivation,  the  State  cannot be\r\n\nrequired constitutionally  to  do  the  impossible  by  providing\r\n\npredeprivation  process.\"     Id.  at  129  (citations  omitted).\r                                          \r\n\nTherefore, \"the proper inquiry under Parratt is whether the state\r                                                                           \r\n\nis in a position to provide for predeprivation process.\"   Id. at\r                                                                       \r\n\n130 (quotation omitted).\r\n\n          Zinermon involved a due process claim against the state\r                            \r\n\ndoctors who admitted the plaintiff Burch as a  \"voluntary\" mental\r\n\npatient.  Burch alleged  that he was incompetent  at the time  of\r\n\nhis  admission  and should  have  been  afforded the  protections\r\n\nprovided by  the involuntary  placement procedure.   Although the\r\n\nCourt found that Parratt-Hudson  doctrine applied to deprivations\r                                         \r\n\nof  liberty, it nevertheless  concluded that Burch  had failed to\r\n\nstate a viable   1983 claim.  Id. at 131-32.\r                                          \r\n\n          The court  found that Burch's claim  was not controlled\r\n\nby Parratt and Hudson for three basic reasons.  First,  the Court\r                               \r\n\nexplained  that the timing of Burch's  deprivation of liberty was\r\n\nmore  predictable than  in  Parratt and  Hudson.   As  the  Court\r                                                         \r\n\nexplained, \"it  is hardly unforeseeable that  a person requesting\r\n\ntreatment  for  mental illness  might  be  incapable of  informed\r\n\nconsent.\"  Id. at  136.  Thus, \"[a]ny erroneous  deprivation will\r                       \r\n\noccur,  if at  all,  at  a  specific,  predicable  point  in  the\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nadmission process.\"  Id.  Second, the Court found that the  state\r                                 \r\n\ncould   have  provided  meaningful   predeprivation  process  and\r\n\npossibly averted the deprivation Burch alleged.  Third, the Court\r\n\nfound that because the state had delegated the hospital officials\r\n\nbroad  authority to  \"effect the  very deprivation  complained of\r\n\nhere,\" their conduct could not be characterized as \"unauthorized\"\r\n\nin the same sense  as the destruction of the  prisoners' property\r\n\nin Parratt and Hudson.\r                               \r\n\n          The  Parratt-Hudson-Zinermon   trilogy  \"requires  that\r                                                \r\n\ncourts scrutinize carefully the assertion by state officials that\r\n\ntheir conduct is  'random and unauthorized'  . .  . where such  a\r\n\nconclusion limits the procedural due process inquiry under   1983\r\n\nto  the  question  of   the  adequacy  of  state  postdeprivation\r\n\nremedies.\"   Lowe v.

This contention ignores\r\n\nboth the nature of the deprivation and the relevant caselaw.

For the  reasons stated below, we\r\n\nconclude that  RFRA does  not apply retroactively  to plaintiffs'\r\n\nclaim for monetary damages.\r\n\n          The  Supreme  Court has  explained  that  courts should\r\n\n\"decline[]  to  give  retroactive  effect  to statutes  burdening\r\n\nprivate  rights unless  Congress  ha[s] made  clear its  intent.\"\r\n\nLandgraf  v.

And, when\r\n            combined  with a  free exercise  claim of\r\n            the nature revealed  by this record, more\r\n            than  merely  a  \"reasonable relation  to\r\n            some purpose within the competency of the\r\n            State\"   is   required  to   sustain  the\r\n            validity of the State's requirement under\r\n            the First Amendment.\r\n\nId. at 232 (discussing Pierce,  268 U.S. 510).  We find  that the\r                                       \r\n\nplaintiffs allegations  do not  bring them  within  the sweep  of\r\n\nYoder for two distinct reasons.\r               \r\n\n          First, as we explained, the plaintiffs'  allegations of\r\n\ninterference with  family relations and  parental prerogatives do\r\n\nnot state a privacy or substantive due process claim.  Their free\r\n\nexercise challenge  is thus  not conjoined with  an independently\r\n\nprotected constitutional protection.  Second, their free exercise\r\n\nclaim  is  qualitatively  distinguishable from  that  alleged  in\r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\nYoder.  As the Court in Yoder emphasized: \r                                       \r\n\n            the Amish in this case  have convincingly\r\n            demonstrated   the  sincerity   of  their\r\n            religious beliefs,  the interrelationship\r\n            of belief  with their  mode of life,  the\r\n            vital  role that belief and daily conduct\r\n            play  in the  continued  survival of  Old\r\n            Order   Amish   communities   and   their\r\n            religious  organization, and  the hazards\r\n            presented by the State's enforcement of a\r\n            Statute generally valid as to others.\r\n\nId. at 235.  Here, the plaintiffs do not allege that the one-time\r            \r\n\ncompulsory attendance at the  Program threatened their entire way\r\n\nof  life.  Accordingly,  the plaintiffs' free  exercise claim for\r\n\ndamages was properly dismissed.\r\n\n          The  plaintiffs  also   seek  a  declaratory   judgment\r\n\nconcerning  the  alleged  infringement  of  their  Free  Exercise\r\n\nRights.   The  standing requirement  of Article  III necessitates\r\n\nthat the claimant \"allege personal injury fairly traceable to the\r\n\ndefendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be addressed\r\n\nby the requested  relief.\"  Allen  v. Wright,  468 U.S. 737,  751\r                                                      \r\n\n(1984).  The  Supreme Court has made clear  that past exposure to\r\n\nharm will not in and of itself confer standing upon a litigant to\r\n\nobtain equitable relief \"[a]bsent a sufficient likelihood that he\r\n\nwill again be wronged  in a similar way.\"  City of Los Angeles v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nLyons, 461 U.S. 95, 104-06, 111 (1983).

Frank,  968 F.2d 1373, 1374-76 (1st  Cir. 1992).\r                                \r\n\nHere, the plaintiffs do not allege (nor does it appear) that they\r\n\nare  likely  to  again  be  subject  to  school  activities  that\r\n\nallegedly  violate their  Free Exercise  Rights.   We accordingly\r\n\nlack  jurisdiction  over the  claim  for  declaratory relief  and\r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nconclude  that it also was properly dismissed.\r\n\nIV.

Sexual Harassment\r                                \r\n\n          The plaintiffs' fifth claim alleges that the defendants\r\n\nengaged  in  sexual harassment  by  creating  a sexually  hostile\r\n\nenvironment, in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments\r\n\nof 1972.  Title IX provides in relevant part:\r\n\n            No person  in the United States shall, on\r                                                               \r\n            the  basis  of   sex,  be  excluded  from\r                                          \r\n            participation in, be denied  the benefits\r\n            of,  or  be  subjected to  discrimination\r\n            under any education  program or  activity\r\n            receiving  Federal  financial  assistance\r\n            . . . .\r\n\n20 U.S.C.   1681.

While\r                                                  \r\n\na court  must consider  all of the  circumstances in  determining\r\n\nwhether  a  plaintiff  has  established that  an  environment  is\r\n\nhostile or abusive,  it must be  particularly concerned with  (1)\r\n\nthe frequency  of the  discriminatory conduct; (2)  its severity;\r\n\n(3) whether  it is  physically threatening or  humiliating rather\r\n\nthan a mere  offensive utterance; and (4) whether it unreasonably\r\n\n                               -31-\r\r\n\ninterferes with an employee's work performance.

Although the presence or absence of psychological\r\n\nharm or an unreasonable effect on work performance  are relevant,\r\n\nno single factor is required.  See id.  \r                                               \r\n\n          The Court has explained  that the relevant factors must\r\n\nbe  viewed both objectively and  subjectively.  See  id. at 1454.\r                                                                 \r\n\nIf the  conduct is not so  severe or pervasive  that a reasonable\r\n\nperson would find it hostile or  abusive, it is beyond Title IX's\r\n\npurview.    See  id.    Similarly,  if  the  plaintiff  does  not\r                             \r\n\nsubjectively perceive the environment  to be abusive, the conduct\r\n\nhas not  actually altered the  conditions of her  employment, and\r\n\nthere  is no Title IX violation.   See id.   Thus, the court must\r                                                   \r\n\nconsider  not only  the actual  effect of  the harassment  on the\r\n\nplaintiff,  but  also the  effect such  conduct  would have  on a\r\n\nreasonable person in the plaintiff's position.\r\n\n          Turning  to the  case at  bar, we  find that  the facts\r\n\nalleged here  are  insufficient  to  state  a  claim  for  sexual\r\n\nharassment under  a hostile environment theory.   The plaintiffs'\r\n\nallegations are weak on every one of the Harris factors, and when\r                                                         \r\n\nconsidered  in sum,  are  clearly insufficient  to establish  the\r\n\nexistence  of an  objectively  hostile  or  abusive  environment.\r\n\nFirst, plaintiffs cannot claim that the offensive speech occurred\r\n\nfrequently,  as  they  allege  only a  one-time  exposure  to the\r\n\ncomments.13\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n13  We do not hold that a one-time episode is per se incapable of\r                                                              \r\nsustaining a  hostile environment  claim.  The  frequency of  the\r\nalleged  harassment is a significant factor, but only one of many\r\n\n                               -32-\r\r\n\n          We also  think that the plaintiffs'  allegations do not\r\n\nestablish that Landolphi's  comments were so severe  as to create\r\n\nan objectively  hostile environment.   This finding  is based  on\r\n\nboth  the context and content  of her remarks.   The remarks were\r\n\ngiven to the entire ninth and tenth grades at what the defendants\r\n\nlabelled   an  \"AIDS  awareness  program.\"    Significantly,  the\r\n\nplaintiffs do not allege  that they were required  to participate\r\n\nin  any of  the  offensive skits  or that  they  were the  direct\r\n\nobjects of Landolphi's sexual comments.\r\n\n          Moreover,  during  his introductory  remarks, defendant\r\n\nGilchrist advised students that the purpose of the Program was to\r\n\neducate them about the dangers of sexual activity, stating:\r\n\n            We  [] see young people in their twenties\r\n            who   are   infected   with    the   AIDS\r\n            virus. . . .   It  means they  caught the\r\n            virus when they were in high  school, and\r\n            will be dead before they are thirty years\r\n            old.  That's why the doctors are  scared,\r\n            and they want you to hear the message.\r\n\n            Now,  sometimes  to  hear  a  message, it\r\n            takes a special messenger.  And today, we\r\n            have a  very special messenger,  who uses\r\n            probably one of the most  effective forms\r\n            of communication -- humor.  I want you to\r\n            listen  carefully.   Enjoy  it, but  also\r\n            remember the message.\r\n\nSimilarly, Landolphi stated in  her opening remarks that \"[w]e're\r\n\ngoing  to talk  about AIDS,  but not  in the  usual way.\"   These\r\n\nprefaces  framed  the Program  in such  a  way that  an objective\r\n\nperson would understand that Landolphi's  allegedly vulgar sexual\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nto  be   considered  in  determining  whether   the  conduct  was\r\n\"sufficiently severe or pervasive\" that a reasonable person would\r\nfind that it had rendered the environment hostile or abusive.\r\n\n                               -33-\r\r\n\ncommentary was intended  to educate the  students about the  AIDS\r\n\nvirus rather than to create a sexually hostile environment.\r\n\n          These  introductions also  belie the  plaintiffs' claim\r\n\nthat   Landolphi's  speech   was   physically   threatening   and\r\n\nhumiliating,     rather   than   a  mere   offensive   utterance.\r\n\nLandolphi's   remarks  were  not  directed  specifically  at  the\r\n\nplaintiffs and were couched in an attempt to use humor to educate\r\n\nthe students on sex and  the AIDS virus.  In this  context, while\r\n\naverage  high school  students might  have been  offended by  the\r\n\ngraphic  sexual discussions  alleged  here,  Landolphi's  remarks\r\n\ncould not  reasonably  be considered  physically  threatening  or\r\n\nhumiliating so as to create a hostile environment.\r\n\n          Similarly, the plaintiffs'  allegations establish  that\r\n\nthe  Program   did  not  significantly  alter  their  educational\r\n\nenvironment from an objective  standpoint.  The Program consisted\r\n\nof  two ninety-minute  sex-education presentations,  and although\r\n\nthe plaintiffs allege that  \"coarse jesting, sexual innuendo, and\r\n\novertly sexual  behavior took place  for the weeks  following the\r\n\nProgram,\" they fail to explain how the coarse jesting and overtly\r\n\nsexual  behavior  \"create[d]   an  atmosphere  so   infused  with\r\n\nhostility  toward members  of  one sex  that  [it] alter[ed]  the\r\n\n[educational  environment] for them.\"   Lipsett, 864 F.2d at 897.\r                                                         \r\n\nIn fact, they allege  that the offensive behavior was  visited on\r\n\n\"those students,\" regardless of gender, \"who were not inclined to\r\n\naccept 'the message' about human sexuality.\"   If anything, then,\r\n\nthey  allege discrimination  based upon  the basis  of viewpoint,\r\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\nrather than on the  basis of gender, as required by Title IX.  We\r\n\ntherefore find that their claim under Title IX fails.\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We have  considered the other claims  of the plaintiffs\r\n\nand find them similarly without merit.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                    Affirmed\r                            \r\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n",

The minors allege that they were compelled to\r\n\nattend an  indecent AIDS and  sex education program  conducted at\r\n\ntheir  public  high school  by  defendant  Hot,  Sexy  and  Safer\r\n\nProductions (\"Hot,  Sexy, and Safer\").   Plaintiffs allege, inter\r                                                                           \r\n\nalia, that  the compelled attendance deprived the minors of their\r              \r\n\nprivacy rights and their right to an educational environment free\r\n\nfrom  sexual   harassment.    The  district   court  granted  the\r\n\ndefendants'  motion  to  dismiss  under  Federal  Rule  of  Civil\r\n\nProcedure 12(b)(6).  We affirm.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The  plaintiffs  are  Chelmsford High  School  students\r\n\nJason P. Mesiti (\"Mesiti\") and Shannon Silva (\"Silva\"), and their\r\n\nparents  Ronald and Suzanne  Brown (\"the Browns\"),  and Carol and\r\n\nRichard Dubreuil  (\"the Dubreuils\").   The  plaintiffs' complaint\r\n\nalleges the following facts,  which we take as true  for purposes\r\n\nof this  appeal.  On April  8, 1992, Mesiti and  Silva attended a\r\n\nmandatory,  school-wide  \"assembly\"  at Chelmsford  High  School.\r\n\nBoth students were  fifteen years old at the time.   The assembly\r\n\nconsisted  of a  ninety-minute presentation characterized  by the\r\n\ndefendants as  an AIDS awareness  program (the  \"Program\").   The\r\n\nProgram  was staged  by defendant  Suzi Landolphi  (\"Landolphi\"),\r\n\ncontracting  through  defendant Hot,  Sexy,  and  Safer, Inc.,  a\r\n\ncorporation wholly owned by Landolphi.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs allege that Landolphi gave sexually explicit\r\n\nmonologues  and participated  in  sexually suggestive  skits with\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nseveral  minors  chosen from  the  audience.   Specifically,  the\r\n\ncomplaint alleges that Landolphi:  1) told the students that they\r\n\nwere  going to  have  a \"group  sexual experience,  with audience\r\n\nparticipation\"; 2) used profane, lewd, and lascivious language to\r\n\ndescribe  body parts  and excretory  functions; 3)  advocated and\r\n\napproved  oral sex, masturbation, homosexual sexual activity, and\r\n\ncondom  use  during  promiscuous  premarital  sex;  4)  simulated\r\n\nmasturbation;  5) characterized the loose pants worn by one minor\r\n\nas \"erection wear\";  6) referred  to being in  \"deep sh--\"  after\r\n\nanal sex; 7) had a male minor lick an oversized  condom with her,\r\n\nafter which  she had a female minor pull it over the male minor's\r\n\nentire head and blow it up; 8) encouraged a male minor to display\r\n\nhis \"orgasm face\"  with her  for the camera;  9) informed a  male\r\n\nminor  that  he  was  not  having  enough  orgasms;  10)  closely\r\n\ninspected a minor and told him he had a \"nice butt\"; and 11) made\r\n\neighteen references to orgasms,  six references to male genitals,\r\n\nand eight references to female genitals.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs maintain  that the sexually  explicit nature\r\n\nof  Landolphi's speech  and  behavior humiliated  and intimidated\r\n\nMesiti  and Silva.   Moreover,  many students  copied Landolphi's\r\n\nroutines and  generally displayed overtly sexual  behavior in the\r\n\nweeks following  the Program, allegedly exacerbating  the minors'\r\n\nharassment.  The  complaint does  not allege that  either of  the\r\n\nminor plaintiffs  actually participated in  any of the  skits, or\r\n\nwere the direct objects of any of Landolphi's comments.\r\n\n          The complaint names eight co-defendants along with Hot,\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nSexy, and Safer,  and Landolphi, alleging  that each played  some\r\n\nrole in planning, sponsoring, producing, and compelling the minor\r\n\nplaintiffs' attendance at the Program.  In March  1992, defendant\r\n\nJudith Hass  (\"Hass\"), then chairperson of  the Chelmsford Parent\r\n\nTeacher Organization  (the  \"PTO\"), initiated  negotiations  with\r\n\nHot, Sexy,  and Safer.   Hass  and  defendant Michael  Gilchrist,\r\n\nM.D., also a member of the PTO, as well as  the school physician,\r\n\nviewed a  promotional videotape  of segments of  Landolphi's past\r\n\nperformances  and  then recommended  the  Program  to the  school\r\n\nadministration.    On  behalf  of   defendant  Chelmsford  School\r\n\nCommittee  (the \"School Committee\"),  Hass executed  an agreement\r\n\nwith Hot, Sexy, and  Safer, and authorized the release  of $1,000\r\n\nof Chelmsford school funds to pay Landolphi's fee.\r\n\n          The  complaint  also  names  as  defendants  two  other\r\n\nmembers of the School Committee, Wendy Marcks and Mary E. Frantz,\r\n\nas well as the Superintendent and Assistant Superintendent of the\r\n\nChelmsford  Public  Schools,  Richard  H.  Moser,  and  David  S.\r\n\nTroughton, and the Principal of Chelmsford High School, George J.\r\n\nBetses.   Plaintiffs allege that all  the defendants participated\r\n\nin the decisions to hire Landolphi, and to compel the students to\r\n\nattend  the Program.  All the  defendants were physically present\r\n\nduring the Program.\r\n\n          A  school  policy  adopted   by  the  School  Committee\r\n\nrequired   \"[p]ositive   subscription,   with  written   parental\r\n\npermission\"  as   a   prerequisite  to   \"instruction  in   human\r\n\nsexuality.\"   The  plaintiffs allege,  however, that  the parents\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nwere not given advance notice of the content of the Program or an\r\n\nopportunity  to  excuse their  children  from  attendance at  the\r\n\nassembly.\r\n\n          The   district  court  granted  defendants'  motion  to\r\n\ndismiss plaintiffs' complaint, pursuant  to Federal Rule of Civil\r\n\nProcedure  12(b)(6), for  failure  to state  a  claim upon  which\r\n\nrelief  may be granted, and  also dismissed the  state law claims\r\n\nunder  the supplemental  jurisdiction principles  of 28  U.S.C.  \r\n\n1367.1   The  district court  deferred entry  of final  judgment,\r\n\ngiving plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint curative  of\r\n\nthe deficiencies by February  10, 1995.  Plaintiffs failed  to do\r\n\nso, and final judgment  was entered on March 3,  1995, dismissing\r\n\ntheir claims. \r\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\n          We  exercise de  novo  review over  a district  court's\r                                         \r\n\ndismissal  of a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).

As\r                                                \r\n\npreviously  discussed,  however,  the liberty  protected  by  the\r\n\nFourteenth Amendment does not  encompass a right to be  free from\r\n\nexposure to speech  which one  regards as offensive.   Thus,  the\r\n\nplaintiffs' asserted liberty interest, if one exists, must derive\r\n\nfrom state law.\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n          The plaintiffs  contend that  state law and  the School\r\n\nCommittee's  policy  on  \"Sex   Education\"  (the  \"Sex  Education\r\n\nPolicy\")  confers  a protected  liberty  interest,  and that  the\r\n\ndefendants'  actions deprived  them  of it  without due  process.\r\n\nSpecifically, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to\r\n\nfollow the school's Sex Education Policy, which provides:\r\n\n            The  Committee  believes that  the public\r\n            schools can best transmit  information on\r\n            human  sexuality  to   students  in   the\r\n            context    of   the    health   education\r\n            continuum.    Therefore, information  and\r\n            instructional  tools  appropriate to  the\r\n            age  group  will   be  used  to   include\r\n            instruction  in  human  sexuality in  the\r\n            curricular offerings on health.  Positive\r                                                               \r\n            subscription,   with   written   parental\r                                                               \r\n            permission,  will  be  a prerequisite  to\r                                                               \r\n            enrolling.  \r                               \r\n\n(Emphasis added.)  The complaint further alleges that the parents\r\n\nwere not  given advance notice of the  contents of the Program or\r\n\nan opportunity to opt out.\r\n\n          Defendants concede  for the  purposes  of their  motion\r\n\nthat  the  Sex Education  Policy  confers a  liberty  interest in\r\n\nfreedom from exposure to  the content of the Program and in being\r\n\nafforded an opportunity to  opt out.8  They argue,  however, that\r\n\nthe  plaintiffs still fail to state a claim because the violation\r\n\nof the Sex Education  Policy was a \"random and  unauthorized\" act\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8  The plaintiffs also maintain that Mass.  Ann. Laws ch. 71,   1\r\n(1995) confers a protected liberty interest.  That statute grants\r\na  right to  opt out  from \"instruction  on disease\"  to students\r\nwhose  \"sincerely  held  religious  beliefs\"  conflict with  such\r\ninstruction.   Defendants assume for the  purposes of this appeal\r\nthat Mass. Gen. L.  ch. 71,   1 is an  alternative source for the\r\nclaimed liberty interest.\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nwithin the confines  of the Parratt-Hudson  doctrine.

The plaintiffs'\r\n\nallegations are weak on every one of the Harris factors, and when\r                                                         \r\n\nconsidered  in sum,  are  clearly insufficient  to establish  the\r\n\nexistence  of an  objectively  hostile  or  abusive  environment.\r\n\nFirst, plaintiffs cannot claim that the offensive speech occurred\r\n\nfrequently,  as  they  allege  only a  one-time  exposure  to the\r\n\ncomments.13\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n13  We do not hold that a one-time episode is per se incapable of\r                                                              \r\nsustaining a  hostile environment  claim.  The  frequency of  the\r\nalleged  harassment is a significant factor, but only one of many\r\n\n                               -32-\r\r\n\n          We also  think that the plaintiffs'  allegations do not\r\n\nestablish that Landolphi's  comments were so severe  as to create\r\n\nan objectively  hostile environment.   This finding  is based  on\r\n\nboth  the context and content  of her remarks.   The remarks were\r\n\ngiven to the entire ninth and tenth grades at what the defendants\r\n\nlabelled   an  \"AIDS  awareness  program.\"    Significantly,  the\r\n\nplaintiffs do not allege  that they were required  to participate\r\n\nin  any of  the  offensive skits  or that  they  were the  direct\r\n\nobjects of Landolphi's sexual comments.\r\n\n          Moreover,  during  his introductory  remarks, defendant\r\n\nGilchrist advised students that the purpose of the Program was to\r\n\neducate them about the dangers of sexual activity, stating:\r\n\n            We  [] see young people in their twenties\r\n            who   are   infected   with    the   AIDS\r\n            virus. . . .   It  means they  caught the\r\n            virus when they were in high  school, and\r\n            will be dead before they are thirty years\r\n            old.  That's why the doctors are  scared,\r\n            and they want you to hear the message.\r\n\n            Now,  sometimes  to  hear  a  message, it\r\n            takes a special messenger.  And today, we\r\n            have a  very special messenger,  who uses\r\n            probably one of the most  effective forms\r\n            of communication -- humor.  I want you to\r\n            listen  carefully.   Enjoy  it, but  also\r\n            remember the message.\r\n\nSimilarly, Landolphi stated in  her opening remarks that \"[w]e're\r\n\ngoing  to talk  about AIDS,  but not  in the  usual way.\"   These\r\n\nprefaces  framed  the Program  in such  a  way that  an objective\r\n\nperson would understand that Landolphi's  allegedly vulgar sexual\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nto  be   considered  in  determining  whether   the  conduct  was\r\n\"sufficiently severe or pervasive\" that a reasonable person would\r\nfind that it had rendered the environment hostile or abusive.\r\n\n                               -33-\r\r\n\ncommentary was intended  to educate the  students about the  AIDS\r\n\nvirus rather than to create a sexually hostile environment.\r\n\n          These  introductions also  belie the  plaintiffs' claim\r\n\nthat   Landolphi's  speech   was   physically   threatening   and\r\n\nhumiliating,     rather   than   a  mere   offensive   utterance.\r\n\nLandolphi's   remarks  were  not  directed  specifically  at  the\r\n\nplaintiffs and were couched in an attempt to use humor to educate\r\n\nthe students on sex and  the AIDS virus.  In this  context, while\r\n\naverage  high school  students might  have been  offended by  the\r\n\ngraphic  sexual discussions  alleged  here,  Landolphi's  remarks\r\n\ncould not  reasonably  be considered  physically  threatening  or\r\n\nhumiliating so as to create a hostile environment.\r\n\n          Similarly, the plaintiffs'  allegations establish  that\r\n\nthe  Program   did  not  significantly  alter  their  educational\r\n\nenvironment from an objective  standpoint.  The Program consisted\r\n\nof  two ninety-minute  sex-education presentations,  and although\r\n\nthe plaintiffs allege that  \"coarse jesting, sexual innuendo, and\r\n\novertly sexual  behavior took place  for the weeks  following the\r\n\nProgram,\" they fail to explain how the coarse jesting and overtly\r\n\nsexual  behavior  \"create[d]   an  atmosphere  so   infused  with\r\n\nhostility  toward members  of  one sex  that  [it] alter[ed]  the\r\n\n[educational  environment] for them.\"   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516408\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Lipsett,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/516408/annabelle-lipsett-v-university-of-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">897</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\r                                                         \r\n\nIn fact, they allege  that the offensive behavior was  visited on\r\n\n\"those students,\" regardless of gender, \"who were not inclined to\r\n\naccept 'the message' about human sexuality.\"   If anything, then,\r\n\nthey  allege discrimination  based upon  the basis  of viewpoint,\r\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\nrather than on the  basis of gender, as required by Title IX.  We\r\n\ntherefore find that their claim under Title IX fails.\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We have  considered the other claims  of the plaintiffs\r\n\nand find them similarly without merit.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                    Affirmed\r                            \r\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n</pre>",
