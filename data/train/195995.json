This appeal comes to us on the\r                    TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.\r                                          \n\nbasis  of diversity jurisdiction.   The parties agree  that it is\n\ngoverned by  the substantive law  of the state  of Massachusetts.\n\nThe plaintiff  is  the  former chief  executive  officer  of  the\n\ndefendant corporation, and his claims stem from an alleged breach\n\nof his  employment agreement  with the defendant.   Specifically,\n\nthe  plaintiff  maintains  that  the  district  court  improperly\n\ngranted  the defendant's  summary judgment  motion because  there\n\nwere  genuine  issues  of material  fact  as  to  whether 1)  the\n\ndefendant breached its agreement  to create a long-term incentive\n\nplan  and communicate its goals to the plaintiff; 2) the doctrine\n\nof promissory estoppel required that the defendant create a long-\n\nterm  incentive plan; 3) the defendant fired the plaintiff in bad\n\nfaith,  in order  to deprive  him of  a benefit  to which  he was\n\nentitled; and 4) the  defendant deceived the plaintiff concerning\n\nits intention to establish  a long-term incentive plan.   For the\n\nfollowing  reasons,  we  affirm  the district  court's  grant  of\r                                         \n\nsummary judgment.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Plaintiff  William G.  Coll (\"Coll\") sued  defendant PB\n\nDiagnostic  Systems, Inc.  (\"PB\") in  the United  States District\n\nCourt  for the District of  Massachusetts.  Coll asserted various\n\nclaims  regarding PB's  alleged  promise to  develop a  long-term\n\nincentive bonus  program in connection with  Coll's employment as\n\nPB's Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\").  After extensive discovery,\n\nthe court granted PB's motion for summary judgment.\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          Although  the  parties  heatedly dispute  many  of  the\n\nissues  on appeal, the facts  central to our  inquiry are largely\n\nuncontroverted.1   The  defendant,  PB, was  founded  in 1985  to\n\ndevelop  and  market  medical  diagnostic instruments.    PB  was\n\nstarted  as a  joint venture  owned in  equal shares  by Polaroid\n\nCorporation   (\"Polaroid\")   and    a   German   company   called\n\nBehringwerke,  A.G.  (\"Behring\").   In  1987,  PB representatives\n\ncontacted the  plaintiff,  Coll, and  informed  him that  PB  was\n\nlooking for a CEO to run the start-up company.\n\n          A.  Pre-hire statements\r                    A.  Pre-hire statements\r                                           \n\n          Coll agreed  to an  interview to discuss  the position,\n\nand  met  with  PB  Board  Chairman  Peter  Kliem  (\"Kliem\")  and\n\nPolaroid's Donald Fronzaglia  (\"Fronzaglia\") at the  Pillar House\n\nrestaurant.  Coll expressed concern that PB would  not be able to\n\noffer him an equity share in the company because it was a \"50/50\"\n\njoint venture.  Kliem confirmed that PB could not offer an equity\n\nshare in the company, but explained that PB intended  to create a\n\nLong Term Incentive  Plan (\"LTIP\")  that would give  the CEO  the\n\nopportunity to earn up to $1,000,000 provided that PB met certain\n\nperformance goals.  Kliem indicated that PB did not yet  have the\n\nLTIP  in place, but that the company looked forward to developing\n\nit  with the  new CEO.   In his  deposition, Coll  admits that he\n\nunderstood this to  mean that any payout under  the LTIP would be\n\n                    \r                              \n\n1   Much of  the factual background recited  here comes from PB's\nStatement of Material Facts Concerning Which There Is  No Genuine\nTriable  Issue, the  remainder coming  from  our scrutiny  of the\nexhibits and depositions.\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\ncontingent  upon the achievement of yet-to-be-defined performance\n\ngoals.  Coll also  testified that he understood  that PB had  not\n\nyet extended him an employment offer.\n\n          B.  The offer letters\r                    B.  The offer letters\r                                         \n\n          After  meeting with  several other  PB representatives,\n\nColl  determined that  he  was interested  in  managing PB.    On\n\nDecember 4,  1987, Kliem sent Coll a letter offering Coll the CEO\n\nposition at  PB (the  \"First Offer  Letter\").    The  First Offer\n\nLetter set forth the salary and annual bonus to be paid Coll, and\n\nfurther stated: \"It is our intent, that in 1989, we would jointly\n\nengage in  establishing  criteria to  appropriately reflect  your\n\ndirect contribution to the success of the venture in 1990.\"  Coll\n\ncalled Fronzaglia and  expressed his concern that the First Offer\n\nLetter did not adequately  address the LTIP or what  would happen\n\nin the event that the venture failed.\n\n          In response to Coll's concerns, Kliem sent Coll another\n\noffer  letter,  dated  December   14,  1989  (the  \"Second  Offer\n\nLetter\").  This letter stated:\n\n               As we have  discussed, we are  pleased\n            to  confirm our  offer  of employment  as\n            General  Manager, PB  Diagnostic Systems,\n            Inc.  (PBDS, Inc.) . . . .\n\n               You will be an employee of  PBDS, Inc.\n            at a starting  salary of $160,000.00  per\n            year,   with   a   guaranteed  bonus   of\n            $40,000.00  per year  for 1988  and 1989,\n            payable   on   your   first  and   second\n            anniversary of  employment.  You  must be\n            an employee  of PBDS, Inc. on those dates\n            to receive payment of these bonuses.\n\n               During  1989,  we  intend  to  jointly\r                                                               \n            explore with you  appropriate methods  of\r                                                               \n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n            compensation to reflect your contribution\r                                                               \n            to the success of the venture in 1990 and\r                                                               \n            beyond.\r                             \n\n               In the event PBDS, Inc. initiates your\n            termination of employment  in the  period\n            between   your    employment   date   and\n            December 31st,  1989,   PBDS,  Inc.  will\n            provide you one year's base salary.\n\n               Further,   in   the   event  of   your\n            separation,  for  any  reason,  you  will\n            refrain   from    working   directly   or\n            indirectly for a  competitor in the field\n            of  medical diagnostics  for a  period of\n            one  year.   This  provision,  of course,\n            will not  apply if PBDS, Inc.  has chosen\n            to cease this joint venture.\n\n               For  purposes of  administration only,\n            Polaroid    Corporation   will    provide\n            benefits in areas  of medical and  dental\n            insurance,   life   insurance  and   401K\n            savings plans.\n\n               We   are   enthusiastic   about   your\n            contribution  and  leadership as  we look\n            forward to the long-term success of PBDS,\n            Inc.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n          After  Coll  received  the  Second   Offer  Letter,  he\n\ntelephoned  Fronzaglia  and  accepted  the offer.    During  this\n\nconversation, Fronzaglia said: \"Does that take care of it?\"  Coll\n\nreplied, \"You  and I understand what it is, so I guess it's O.K.\"\n\nColl admitted in  his deposition  that at that  time he  believed\n\nthat  the  Second Offer  Letter  incorporated all  the  terms and\n\nconditions of his employment, and that he believed that there was\n\nno material difference between the First and Second Offer Letters\n\nwith regard to the LTIP.\n\n          C.  Coll's tenure at PB\r                    C.  Coll's tenure at PB\r                                           \n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n          In  October 1988,  the PB Board  of Directors  formed a\n\nCompensation Committee to develop  compensation packages for PB's\n\nsenior  executives.   In April  1989, the  Compensation Committee\n\ndeveloped  an executive compensation  proposal which  included an\n\nAnnual Bonus Plan and a  LTIP.  The proposal, which was  shown to\n\nColl prior to being presented to the Board of Directors, included\n\na  payout package  that gave  Coll the  opportunity to  earn over\n\n$1,000,000 in incentive compensation.\n\n          On  April 20,  1989, PB's  Board of  Directors met  and\n\nunanimously  approved both  the Annual Bonus  Plan and  the LTIP.\n\nPayout  under the  LTIP was  contingent upon  the achievement  of\n\ncertain long term goals, described in the LTIP as:\n\n               Milestones  as  developed  by PBDS  in\n            accordance  with  the  business plan  and\n            subject   to   approval  of   the  Board.\n            Evaluation of business  progress made  by\n            the  Board prior  to  the  1992 and  1994\n            payouts.\n\nOn  July 18,  1989,  in response  to  the Board's  request,  Coll\n\nsubmitted a written memorandum  suggesting payout milestones  for\n\nthe LTIP:\n\n               The  Board  of Directors  has approved\n            conceptually a LTIP for PBDS senior staff\n            (7 persons).  The Board has also approved\n            specific  funding  for  this   Plan,  1/3\n            payable in 1992 and 2/3 payable  in 1994.\n            Per  your  request,  we  have  considered\n            targets appropriate  to such a  long term\n            plan and our recommendation follows.\n\n               Since  the  Annual   Bonus  Plan   has\n            targets  approved  each  year  which  are\n            tactical  and  short-term  in nature,  we\n            believe that the company's  interests can\n            be best served  by emphasizing  strategic\n            and  results-oriented  goals in  the Long\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n            Term Plan.\n\n               For 1992 (year  end), criteria  should\n            include\n            -entrance into US market\n            -entrance into European market\n            -profitability\n            -positive cash flow\n\n            Criteria for 1994, \n            -profitability at \"x\" level or better\n            -internal  rate  of  return  at  \"y%\"  or\n            better\n\n            I look forward to discussing with you the\n            utilization of these strategic goals.\n\n          PB claims that in October 1989, its  Board of Directors\n\nconsidered  and approved the goals proposed by Coll for the LTIP.\n\nThe   relevant  minutes   from   this   meeting  read:   \"Various\n\ncompensation and incentive matters were discussed and approved.\"\n\n          In  April  1990, Coll  presented his  revised five-year\n\nbusiness  plan for PB,  projecting \"profitability\"  and \"positive\n\ncash flow\"  by the end  of 1992.  A  year later, it  became clear\n\nthat PB would not  meet the profitability and positive  cash flow\n\ngoals embodied in the  revised five-year plan.  To  the contrary,\n\nPB  suffered tremendous losses in the years 1989, 1990, 1991, and\n\n1992.    On  April  4,  1991,  Coll  wrote  to  the  Compensation\n\nCommittee, proposing to lower the original goals of the LTIP:\n\n               This memo will address  several issues\n            related   to  the   [LTIP]  and   to  the\n            discussion    points   raised    at   the\n            Compensation    Committee   meeting    on\n            March 27, 1991. . . .\n\n               1.  The  goals originally  established\r                                                               \n            for the  1992  payout of  the [LTIP]  are\r                                                               \n            conceptually satisfactory.   The goal  of\r                                                \n            \"entrance into the US market\"  is already\n            met and  the goal  of \"entrance  into the\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n            European   market\"   is  well   underway.\n            Perhaps  the  more  critical  goals  are,\n            however,  \"profitability\"  and  \"positive\n            cash flow.\"  I believe that we should use\n            the   concepts   of   profitability   and\n            positive  cash flow,  but that  we should\n            look  at  these numbers  not  as absolute\n            dollar  amounts   within  absolute  time-\n            frames,  but  as  measures   of  progress\n            against marketplace, product and business\n            goals.   To  state that  \"our goal  is to\n            become  profitable  and to  have positive\n            cash flow  by Q4,  1992\" is an  excellent\n            tool  to  motivate  managers   and  their\n            organizations  and  we have  communicated\n            profitability  and  cash  flow goals  and\n            responsibilities to our employees. . . .\n\n               Certainly, we will not use these tools\n            indiscriminately    and    without    the\n            concurrence  of the  Board.   Further, we\n            agree  that  we  must  continuously  show\n            positive  results  in  profitability  and\n            cash flow.   As a result,  the management\n            should be measured against its ability to\n            deliver  positive  profitability  on  the\n            incremental  shipments/revenue  that  are\n            made in 1992.\n\n                             . . . .\n\n               Therefore, my  recommendations for the\n            goals are\n            -entrance into US market\n            -entrance into European market\n            -25% operating profit on incremental 1991\n            to 1992 revenues\n\n                             . . . .\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n          PB's  Board  of  Directors  was scheduled  to  meet  on\n\nSeptember 5, 1991.  Just prior to this meeting, Coll submitted  a\n\nlengthy  memo in which he again proposed  to lower the targets of\n\nthe LTIP.  He informed the Board that the current  targets of the\n\nLTIP were unattainable and that, therefore, the LTIP was unlikely\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nto create the desired  incentives.  He  urged the Board to  lower\n\nthe  targets of the  LTIP so that  there would be  a potential in\n\n1992 for payout under the LTIP.  In pertinent part, the memo read\n\nas follows:\n\n               Background:      In  1989   the  Board\n            approved  the  basic Long  Term Incentive\n            (LTI) plan concepts, including  the split\n            of   goals  to   effect  1992   and  1994\n            payments.   At that time, the targets for\n            1992 were suggested to be:\n            -entrance into US market\n            -entrance into European market\n            -profitability\n            -positive cash flow\n\n                             . . . .\n\n            Half of the goals cited above will not be\n            met.   . . .   Profitability and positive\n            cash flow are now  forecast for 1993, not\n            1992.\n\n            The     retentive    and     motivational\n            capabilities  of  the  LTI are  therefore\n            compromised  for  1992, and  the original\n            reason the Compensation Committee had for\n            designing  a  1992 payment  was  to \"keep\n            people interested.\"\n\n               The dilemma  therefore is do we keep a\r                                                               \n            plan  that in  its  current construct  is\r                                                               \n            unlikely to fulfill its purpose?\r                                                      \n\n               Do we keep the  original plan or do we\n            review other options?\n\n                             . . . .\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n          At its September 5, 1991, meeting, the Board considered\n\nColl's proposal and  rejected it.   The minutes  of that  meeting\n\nread as follows:\n\n            A  management  proposal  to  replace  the\n            Company's  Long-Term  Incentive Plan  was\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n            considered.    The existing  Plan appears\n            unlikely     to     produce     incentive\n            compensation payments under the Company's\n            present   business    forecasts.      The\n            management  proposed  replacing the  plan\n            with  one  that  would provide  realistic\n            incentives to the Company's management.\n\n            .  .   .   Directors  pointed   out   the\n            inadvisability of lowering the objectives\n            of  an incentive  plan  to match  lowered\n            performance expectations. . . .  \n\n            After further discussion,  the Board  did\n            not accept  the  proposal to  modify  the\n            current  plan.   The  Board  approved  in\n            principle  the  adoption  of a  successor\n            long-term incentive compensation plan for\n            later years, with the prospect  of a one-\n            third  payout in  1993  and a  two-thirds\n            payout in 1995.\n\n          D.

Coll's termination\r                                          \n\n          On  January  14,  1992,  Coll's employment  at  PB  was\n\nterminated by unanimous decision  of the Board of Directors.   PB\n\nwrote Coll, explaining that the sponsor companies -- Polaroid and\n\nBehring  -- were  disappointed  with  PB's business  performance.\n\nNevertheless,  the letter  explained, because  Coll's termination\n\nwas due in part to corporate restructuring, PB would pay Coll one\n\nyear's salary as a lump sum severance payment, in accordance with\n\nhis employment contract.  Moreover, the letter continued, \"in the\n\nunlikely event of  a payout under the  long term bonus  plan, you\n\nwill be eligible  for participation  on a pro-rated  basis.\"   PB\n\nnever achieved the two  of the four goals originally  proposed by\n\nColl to be the 1992 targets of the LTIP.\n\n                     II.

The Contract Claim\r                                           \n\n          The  crux of Coll's breach of contract claim is that PB\n\nbreached its  agreement to implement a  long-term incentive plan.\n\nHe further  alleges that  the parties'  agreement required PB  to\n\ncommunicate to  Coll  the goals  on which  the incentive  bonuses\n\nwould be premised, and that PB failed to do so.\n\n          To  recover damages  for breach  of contract  at trial,\n\nColl would have been required to demonstrate (1) that the parties\n\nreached  a valid and binding  agreement with regard  to the LTIP;\n\n(2) that PB  breached the terms of this aspect  of his employment\n\ncontract; and  (3) that he suffered damages  from the breach.  To\n\nsurvive PB's  summary judgment motion,  Coll was required  to put\n\nforth competent evidence on each of these issues.\n\n          The  district  court  offered  alternate   holdings  in\n\nsupport  of its  summary judgment  ruling against  Coll.   As one\n\nbasis, the  district court held that  Coll's employment agreement\n\ndid not obligate PB  to create and implement a  LTIP but, rather,\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nwas only a non-binding  \"agreement to agree.\"  As  an alternative\n\nbasis,  the district  court found  that, even  assuming that  the\n\nparties reached  a binding agreement  regarding the LTIP,  PB had\n\nnot  breached  it.   The  court  held  that  the contract  merely\n\nobligated PB to  \"jointly explore  . . .  appropriate methods  of\n\ncompensation to  reflect [Coll's] contribution to  the success of\n\nthe venture in 1990 and  beyond,\" and that PB had  fulfilled this\n\nobligation.\n\n          The   pertinent   law   is  well   settled.      \"Under\n\nMassachusetts law,  interpretation of a contract  is ordinarily a\n\nquestion  of law  for the  court.\"   Fairfield 274-278  Clarendon\r                                                                           \n\nTrust v.

App.Ct. 146, 150, 558 N.E.2d 1134,1136 (1990).\r                  \n\n          With regard to long-term incentive compensation, Coll's\n\nemployment  contract  contains the  following language:   \"During\n\n1989, we intend  to jointly explore with  you appropriate methods\n\nof compensation  to reflect your  contribution to the  success of\n\nthe  venture in  1990  and beyond.\"    Coll maintains  that  this\n\nlanguage embodies  a previously reached agreement  on the subject\n\nand  thus obligated  PB to  develop a  LTIP, establish  clear and\n\nreasonable goals for  the plan,  and communicate  those goals  to\n\nColl.  He relies on his contractual negotiations as evidence that\n\nPB  intended to  obligate  itself to  create  a LTIP  that  would\n\nprovide  Coll with the opportunity to earn at least $1,000,000 in\n\nincentive  compensation.    To   prevail  on  this  theory,  Coll\n\ninitially must show either (1) that his employment  contract with\n\nPB  was not  an integrated  agreement with  respect  to incentive\n\ncompensation, or (2) that  the contractual language is consistent\n\nwith his assertions.  We think he has done neither.\n\n                    \r                              \n\nagreements to  the  extent  that  they  are  within  its  scope.\"\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts   213.\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n          All the relevant evidence indicates that the employment\n\ncontract was an  integrated and final expression  of the parties'\n\nagreement with  respect to  compensation matters.   The agreement\n\nlists  Coll's  base  salary,  his  annual  bonus,  his  severance\n\ncompensation,  and a  non-competition agreement.   In  short, the\n\nface of  the document contains  nothing that would  indicate that\n\nthe  parties  did  not  intend it  to  be  a  complete and  final\n\nexpression  of  their rights  and  obligations.   Moreover,  Coll\n\nadmitted in  his deposition that he thought  at the time that the\n\ncontract embodied all  the material terms  and conditions of  his\n\nemployment.   Given  these  considerations, we  find that  Coll's\n\nemployment agreement  was an  integrated document subject  to the\n\ntenets  of the parol evidence rule, and  as such must be enforced\n\naccording  to its terms unless  the terms are  ambiguous on their\n\nface.\n\n          Coll asserts that the  relevant contractual language is\n\nambiguous  and  should be  submitted  to  the  jury to  determine\n\nwhether it obligated  PB to  develop a LTIP  and communicate  its\n\ngoals to Coll.  We disagree.  The clear language  of the contract\n\nstates only  that PB  \"intend[s] to  jointly explore  with [Coll]\n\nappropriate  methods of  compensation.\"   Any  ambiguity in  this\n\nlanguage  centers around whether it  obligates PB to do anything.\r                                                                          \n\nAssuming it  creates a binding obligation,3  the language clearly\n                    \r                              \n\n3  As we stated  above, the district court held that  the parties\nhad merely created a non-binding agreement  to agree with respect\nto long-term compensation.   For the purposes of this  appeal, we\nassume  arguendo  that the  language  is  binding,  and base  our\nanalysis  on whether  PB  breached  its contractual  obligations.\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\ndoes not support Coll's assertions.  To turn the words \"we intend\n\nto jointly  explore appropriate  methods of compensation\"  into a\n\nbinding obligation  to develop, fund,  and implement a  LTIP that\n\nwould provide up to $1,000,000 of incentive compensation would be\n\ncompletely at odds  with the  common and natural  meaning of  the\n\nwords.  Rather,  we assume  that the parties  intended what  they\n\nwrote: that PB intended to make a good faith effort to explore an\n\nappropriate  compensation package  for Coll,  including incentive\n\nbonuses.\n\n          The   evidence   presented    for   summary    judgment\n\ndemonstrates clearly that PB fulfilled this obligation.  Not only\n\ndid  it explore new incentive packages, it developed and funded a\n\nLTIP plan for Coll  and his senior executives.  And although Coll\n\ndisputes the point, the evidence shows that Coll himself proposed\n\nthe  plan's goals, which PB failed to meet under his stewardship.\n\nUnder these circumstances,  there was no  breach of contract  and\n\nsummary judgment on that claim was certainly appropriate.\n\n          B.

The promissory estoppel claim\r                                                     \n\n          As an  alternative to  his contract claim,  Coll argues\n\nthat  he  is  entitled to  damages  on  the  basis of  promissory\n\nestoppel.    Specifically,  Coll  alleges  that  during  contract\n\nnegotiations PB promised to  develop a LTIP in order  to persuade\n\nColl to  accept  the CEO  position  at PB.    The district  court\n\n                    \r                              \n\nBecause we conclude that there was no breach, we need not address\nwhether  the employment  contract was  in fact  binding regarding\nlong-term compensation or  whether it was, as the  district court\nfound, merely a non-binding agreement to agree.\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nrejected  Coll's promissory  estoppel  claim,  holding that  Coll\n\ncould  not have  reasonably  relied on  the pre-hire  discussions\n\nregarding the LTIP.

Coll's employment offer was clearly at\n\nodds with  his understanding  of PB's prior  oral representations\n\nregarding  long-term compensation.    Upon receipt  of the  First\n\nOffer  Letter, Coll  called PB  and raised  his concern  that the\n\nlanguage in  the offer did  not seem to  obligate PB to  create a\n\nLTIP  that could  pay him  up to  $1,000,000.5   When  the Second\n                    \r                              \n\n5   The First Offer Letter stated,  in pertinent part: \"It is our\nintent, that  in 1989, we  would jointly  engage in  establishing\ncriteria to appropriately reflect your direct contribution to the\nsuccess of the venture in 1990.\"\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nOffer Letter essentially rephrased the same noncommittal language\n\ncontained in  its predecessor, Coll  should have been  aware that\n\nthere was a potential disagreement over the LTIP.   Nevertheless,\n\nColl  acquiesced  to the  language  in the  Second  Offer Letter,\n\npurportedly because he did not  want PB to think that he  did not\n\ntrust them.   He cannot now second-guess his negotiating strategy\n\nand claim  the benefit of a bargain he did  not negotiate.  As we\n\ndiscussed  above, the language in the Second Offer Letter clearly\n\ndid  not obligate  PB  to  do  anything  more  than  explore  the\n\nfeasibility of a LTIP.  Moreover, Coll admitted that, despite the\n\nconcerns he had raised, he recognized that the terms of the offer\n\nletters   were   essentially   identical    regarding   long-term\n\ncompensation.  In short,  PB's refusal to \"firm up\"  the language\n\nregarding long-term compensation rendered  any reliance on  prior\n\noral representations  unreasonable.   Accordingly, we  affirm the\n\ndistrict  court's  grant of  summary  judgment for  PB  on Coll's\n\npromissory estoppel claim.6\n\n          C.

The plaintiff is the former chief executive officer of the defendant corporation, and his claims stem from an alleged breach of his employment agreement with the defendant.  Specifically, the plaintiff maintains that the district court improperly granted the defendant's summary judgment motion because there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether 1) the defendant breached its agreement to create a long-term incentive plan and communicate its goals to the plaintiff;  2) the doctrine of promissory estoppel required that the defendant create a long-term incentive plan;  3) the defendant fired the plaintiff in bad faith, in order to deprive him of a benefit to which he was entitled;  and 4) the defendant deceived the plaintiff concerning its intention to establish a long-term incentive plan.

(\"PB\") in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  Coll asserted various claims regarding PB's alleged promise to develop a long-term incentive bonus program in connection with Coll's employment as PB's Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\").  After extensive discovery, the court granted PB's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the parties heatedly dispute many of the issues on appeal, the facts central to our inquiry are largely uncontroverted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The defendant, PB, was founded in 1985 to develop and market medical diagnostic instruments.  PB was started as a joint venture owned in equal shares by Polaroid Corporation (\"Polaroid\") and a German company called Behringwerke, A.G.  (\"Behring\").  In 1987, PB representatives contacted the plaintiff, Coll, and informed him that PB was looking for a CEO to run the start-up company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Pre-hire statements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coll agreed to an interview to discuss the position, and met with PB Board Chairman Peter Kliem (\"Kliem\") and Polaroid's Donald Fronzaglia (\"Fronzaglia\") at the Pillar House restaurant.  Coll expressed concern that PB would not be able to offer him an equity share in the company because it was a \"50/50\" joint venture.  Kliem confirmed that PB could not offer an equity share in the company, but explained that PB intended to create a Long Term Incentive Plan (\"LTIP\") that would give the CEO the opportunity to earn up to $1,000,000 provided that PB met certain performance goals.  Kliem indicated that PB did not yet have the LTIP in place, but that the company looked forward to developing it with the new CEO.  In his deposition, Coll admits that he understood this to mean that any payout under the LTIP would be contingent upon the achievement of yet-to-be-defined performance goals.  Coll also testified that he understood that PB had not yet extended him an employment offer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The offer letters</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After meeting with several other PB representatives, Coll determined that he was interested in managing PB.  On December 4, 1987, Kliem sent Coll a letter offering Coll the CEO position at PB (the \"First Offer Letter\").  The First Offer Letter set forth the salary and annual bonus to be paid Coll, and further stated:  \"It is our intent, that in 1989, we would jointly engage in establishing criteria to appropriately reflect your direct contribution to the success of the venture in 1990.\"   Coll called Fronzaglia and expressed his concern that the First Offer Letter did not adequately address the LTIP or what would happen in the event that the venture failed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Coll's concerns, Kliem sent Coll another offer letter, dated December 14, 1989 (the \"Second Offer Letter\").

During this conversation, Fronzaglia said:  \"Does that take care of it?\"   Coll replied, \"You and I understand what it is, so I guess it's O.K.\"   Coll admitted in his deposition that at that time he believed that the Second Offer Letter incorporated all the terms and conditions of his employment, and that he believed that there was no material difference between the First and Second Offer Letters with regard to the LTIP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Coll's tenure at PB</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1988, the PB Board of Directors formed a Compensation Committee to develop compensation packages for PB's senior executives.  In April 1989, the Compensation Committee developed an executive compensation proposal which included an Annual Bonus Plan and a LTIP.  The proposal, which was shown to Coll prior to being presented to the Board of Directors, included a payout package that gave Coll the opportunity to earn over $1,000,000 in incentive compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 20, 1989, PB's Board of Directors met and unanimously approved both the Annual Bonus Plan and the LTIP.  Payout under the LTIP was contingent upon the achievement of certain long term goals, described in the LTIP as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Milestones as developed by PBDS in accordance with the business plan and subject to approval of the Board.

The relevant minutes from this meeting read:  \"Various compensation and incentive matters were discussed and approved.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1990, Coll presented his revised five-year business plan for PB, projecting \"profitability\" and \"positive cash flow\" by the end of 1992.  A year later, it became clear that PB would not meet the profitability and positive cash flow goals embodied in the revised five-year plan.  To the contrary, PB suffered tremendous losses in the years 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992.  On April 4, 1991, Coll wrote to the Compensation Committee, proposing to lower the original goals of the LTIP:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This memo will address several issues related to the [LTIP] and to the discussion points raised at the Compensation Committee meeting on March 27, 1991....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  The goals originally established for the 1992 payout of the [LTIP] are conceptually satisfactory.   The goal of \"entrance into the US market\" is already met and the goal of \"entrance into the European market\" is well underway.  Perhaps the more critical goals are, however, \"profitability\" and \"positive cash flow.\"   I believe that we should use the concepts of profitability and positive cash flow, but that we should look at these numbers not as absolute dollar amounts within absolute time-frames, but as measures of progress against marketplace, product and business goals.  To state that \"our goal is to become profitable and to have positive cash flow by Q4, 1992\" is an excellent tool to motivate managers and their organizations and we have communicated profitability and cash flow goals and responsibilities to our employees....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, we will not use these tools indiscriminately and without the concurrence of the Board.  Further, we agree that we must continuously show positive results in profitability and cash flow.  As a result, the management should be measured against its ability to deliver positive profitability on the incremental shipments/revenue that are made in 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, my recommendations for the goals are</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">--entrance into US market</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">--entrance into European market</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">--25% operating profit on incremental 1991 to 1992 revenues</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PB's Board of Directors was scheduled to meet on September 5, 1991.  Just prior to this meeting, Coll submitted a lengthy memo in which he again proposed to lower the targets of the LTIP.  He informed the Board that the current targets of the LTIP were unattainable and that, therefore, the LTIP was unlikely to create the desired incentives.  He urged the Board to lower the targets of the LTIP so that there would be a potential in 1992 for payout under the LTIP.  In pertinent part, the memo read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>Background:  In 1989 the Board approved the basic Long Term Incentive (LTI) plan concepts, including the split of goals to effect 1992 and 1994 payments.  At that time, the targets for 1992 were suggested to be:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>--entrance into US market</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>--entrance into European market</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>--profitability</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>--positive cash flow</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>Half of the goals cited above will not be met....  Profitability and positive cash flow are now forecast for 1993, not 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>The retentive and motivational capabilities of the LTI are therefore compromised for 1992, and the original reason the Compensation Committee had for designing a 1992 payment was to \"keep people interested.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dilemma therefore is do we keep a plan that in its current construct is unlikely to fulfill its purpose?Do we keep the original plan or do we review other options?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At its September 5, 1991, meeting, the Board considered Coll's proposal and rejected it.  The minutes of that meeting read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>A management proposal to replace the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan was considered.  The existing Plan appears unlikely to produce incentive compensation payments under the Company's present business forecasts.  The management proposed replacing the plan with one that would provide realistic incentives to the Company's management.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p>. Directors pointed out the inadvisability of lowering the objectives of an incentive plan to match lowered performance expectations....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>After further discussion, the Board did not accept the proposal to modify the current plan.  The Board approved in principle the adoption of a successor long-term incentive compensation plan for later years, with the prospect of a one-third payout in 1993 and a two-thirds payout in 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Coll's termination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 14, 1992, Coll's employment at PB was terminated by unanimous decision of the Board of Directors.  PB wrote Coll, explaining that the sponsor companies--Polaroid and Behring--were disappointed with PB's business performance.  Nevertheless, the letter explained, because Coll's termination was due in part to corporate restructuring, PB would pay Coll one year's salary as a lump sum severance payment, in accordance with his employment contract.  Moreover, the letter continued, \"in the unlikely event of a payout under the long term bonus plan, you will be eligible for participation on a pro-rated basis.\"   PB never achieved the two of the four goals originally proposed by Coll to be the 1992 targets of the LTIP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo and read the record in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, drawing all inferences in the non-moving party's favor.

Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  A \"material\" fact is one \"that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\"  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).  A dispute about a material fact is \"genuine\" if \"the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"  Id.  Essentially, Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment \"against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\"  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).  The nonmoving party \"may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the ... pleadings, but ... must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e).

The Contract Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crux of Coll's breach of contract claim is that PB breached its agreement to implement a long-term incentive plan.  He further alleges that the parties' agreement required PB to communicate to Coll the goals on which the incentive bonuses would be premised, and that PB failed to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recover damages for breach of contract at trial, Coll would have been required to demonstrate (1) that the parties reached a valid and binding agreement with regard to the LTIP;  (2) that PB breached the terms of this aspect of his employment contract;  and (3) that he suffered damages from the breach.  To survive PB's summary judgment motion, Coll was required to put forth competent evidence on each of these issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court offered alternate holdings in support of its summary judgment ruling against Coll.  As one basis, the district court held that Coll's employment agreement did not obligate PB to create and implement a LTIP but, rather, was only a non-binding \"agreement to agree.\"   As an alternative basis, the district court found that, even assuming that the parties reached a binding agreement regarding the LTIP, PB had not breached it.  The court held that the contract merely obligated PB to \"jointly explore ... appropriate methods of compensation to reflect [Coll's] contribution to the success of the venture in 1990 and beyond,\" and that PB had fulfilled this obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pertinent law is well settled.  \"Under Massachusetts law, interpretation of a contract is ordinarily a question of law for the court.\"  Fairfield 274-278 Clarendon Trust v.

He relies on his contractual negotiations as evidence that PB intended to obligate itself to create a LTIP that would provide Coll with the opportunity to earn at least $1,000,000 in incentive compensation.  To prevail on this theory, Coll initially must show either (1) that his employment contract with PB was not an integrated agreement with respect to incentive compensation, or (2) that the contractual language is consistent with his assertions.  We think he has done neither.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All the relevant evidence indicates that the employment contract was an integrated and final expression of the parties' agreement with respect to compensation matters.  The agreement lists Coll's base salary, his annual bonus, his severance compensation, and a non-competition agreement.  In short, the face of the document contains nothing that would indicate that the parties did not intend it to be a complete and final expression of their rights and obligations.  Moreover, Coll admitted in his deposition that he thought at the time that the contract embodied all the material terms and conditions of his employment.  Given these considerations, we find that Coll's employment agreement was an integrated document subject to the tenets of the parol evidence rule, and as such must be enforced according to its terms unless the terms are ambiguous on their face.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coll asserts that the relevant contractual language is ambiguous and should be submitted to the jury to determine whether it obligated PB to develop a LTIP and communicate its goals to Coll.  We disagree.  The clear language of the contract states only that PB \"intend[s] to jointly explore with [Coll] appropriate methods of compensation.\"   Any ambiguity in this language centers around whether it obligates PB to do anything.   Assuming it creates a binding obligation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the language clearly does not support Coll's assertions.  To turn the words \"we intend to jointly explore appropriate methods of compensation\" into a binding obligation to develop, fund, and implement a LTIP that would provide up to $1,000,000 of incentive compensation would be completely at odds with the common and natural meaning of the words.  Rather, we assume that the parties intended what they wrote:  that PB intended to make a good faith effort to explore an appropriate compensation package for Coll, including incentive bonuses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence presented for summary judgment demonstrates clearly that PB fulfilled this obligation.  Not only did it explore new incentive packages, it developed and funded a LTIP plan for Coll and his senior executives.  And although Coll disputes the point, the evidence shows that Coll himself proposed the plan's goals, which PB failed to meet under his stewardship.  Under these circumstances, there was no breach of contract and summary judgment on that claim was certainly appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The promissory estoppel claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an alternative to his contract claim, Coll argues that he is entitled to damages on the basis of promissory estoppel.  Specifically, Coll alleges that during contract negotiations PB promised to develop a LTIP in order to persuade Coll to accept the CEO position at PB.  The district court rejected Coll's promissory estoppel claim, holding that Coll could not have reasonably relied on the pre-hire discussions regarding the LTIP.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"An element of promissory estoppel is that the party invoking it must have reasonably relied on the alleged promise to his detriment.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Hall v. Horizon House Microwave, 24 Mass.App.Ct. 84, 506 N.E.2d 178, 184 (1987) (emphasis added).  Where a written statement conflicts with a prior oral representation, reliance on the oral representation is generally held to be unreasonable.  See Trifiro v. New York Life Insurance Co., 845 F.2d 30, 33-34 (1st Cir.1988) (\"The conflicting content of [the defendant's] oral statement with [his] written statement ... should have placed [the plaintiff] on notice that he should not rely on either statement.\").

A reasonable person does not gamble with the law of the excluded middle, he suspends judgment until further evidence is obtained.  Explicit conflict engenders doubt, and to rely on a statement the veracity of which one should doubt is unreasonable.  The law does not supply epistemological insurance.  Nor does it countenance reliance on one of a pair of contradictories simply because it facilitates the achievement of one's goal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a case similar to the one at bar, an employee sought entitlement to stock options allegedly promised him during compensation-package negotiations with his employer.  Hall, 506 N.E.2d at 184.   In rejecting the promissory estoppel claim, the court held that \"[g]iven the extended and persistently inconclusive nature of his negotiations ... about an over-all employment and compensation package, [the plaintiff] could not have had more than a well founded hope that the stock option aspect of the deal would work out satisfactorily for him.  Inchoate negotiations are no better basis for reliance than for an action on the purported contract as such.\"  Id. (citing Tull v. Mister Donut Dev.  Corp., 7 Mass.App.Ct. 626, 389 N.E.2d 447 (1979)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming arguendo that PB in fact promised Coll that it would create a LTIP worth $1,000,000, Coll could not have reasonably relied on it.  Coll's employment offer was clearly at odds with his understanding of PB's prior oral representations regarding long-term compensation.  Upon receipt of the First Offer Letter, Coll called PB and raised his concern that the language in the offer did not seem to obligate PB to create a LTIP that could pay him up to $1,000,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  When the Second Offer Letter essentially rephrased the same noncommittal language contained in its predecessor, Coll should have been aware that there was a potential disagreement over the LTIP.  Nevertheless, Coll acquiesced to the language in the Second Offer Letter, purportedly because he did not want PB to think that he did not trust them.  He cannot now second-guess his negotiating strategy and claim the benefit of a bargain he did not negotiate.  As we discussed above, the language in the Second Offer Letter clearly did not obligate PB to do anything more than explore the feasibility of a LTIP.  Moreover, Coll admitted that, despite the concerns he had raised, he recognized that the terms of the offer letters were essentially identical regarding long-term compensation.  In short, PB's refusal to \"firm up\" the language regarding long-term compensation rendered any reliance on prior oral representations unreasonable.  Accordingly, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment for PB on Coll's promissory estoppel claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

An employer's obligation of good faith and fair dealing imposes liability for the loss of compensation clearly related to an employee's past service when that employee is discharged without good cause.  Gram v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 384 Mass. 659, 429 N.E.2d 21, 27-29 (1981).  As we noted in Biggins,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p>[T]he Gram court was careful to distinguish between recovery based on the employee's loss of future wages for past services, and any claim for recovery based on loss of future income for future services.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court explicitly limited this theory of \"wrongful discharge\" to situations in which the employee's discharge without good cause deprives the employee of compensation for services previously earned or past services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biggins v. Hazen Paper Co., 953 F.2d 1405, 1416 (1st Cir.1992) (discussing Gram, 429 N.E.2d at 27-29).  Fortune liability does not encompass situations where the employee merely was fired arbitrarily.  Id.  Rather, in order to establish a claim of wrongful termination, the plaintiff must demonstrate that his discharge was \"contrived to despoil [him] of earned commission or similar compensation due for past services.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, we do not find that Coll's termination deprived him of any particular benefit to which he was entitled.  Coll contends that because his termination occurred just as he was \"pressing [PB's Board] to define the goals of the LTIP,\" there is a genuine issue as to whether the Board terminated him to avoid paying him nearly $1,000,000 under the LTIP.  Brief for Appellant at 44.  The undisputed facts do not support this contention.  Coll's own writings indicate that two of the four goals of the LTIP would not be met, and that there was thus no potential for payout in 1992 under the LTIP:  \"Half of the goals ... will not be met....  Profitability and positive cash flow are now forecast for 1993, not 1992.  The retentive and motivational capabilities of the LTI are therefore compromised for 1992....\"  The Board's minutes echo this:  \"A management proposal to replace the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan was considered.  The existing Plan appears unlikely to produce incentive compensation payments under the Company's present business forecasts.\"   Accordingly, we agree with the district court that Coll's termination did not strip him of compensation due for past services, and affirm the dismissal of Coll's wrongful termination claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered the other issues raised by Coll and find them equally meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Much of the factual background recited here comes from PB's Statement of Material Facts Concerning Which There Is No Genuine Triable Issue, the remainder coming from our scrutiny of the exhibits and depositions</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> \"(1) A binding integrated agreement discharges prior agreements to the extent that it is inconsistent with them.

The parties agree that it is governed by the substantive law of the state of Massachusetts.  The plaintiff is the former chief executive officer of the defendant corporation, and his claims stem from an alleged breach of his employment agreement with the defendant.  Specifically, the plaintiff maintains that the district court improperly granted the defendant's summary judgment motion because there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether 1) the defendant breached its agreement to create a long-term incentive plan and communicate its goals to the plaintiff;  2) the doctrine of promissory estoppel required that the defendant create a long-term incentive plan;  3) the defendant fired the plaintiff in bad faith, in order to deprive him of a benefit to which he was entitled;  and 4) the defendant deceived the plaintiff concerning its intention to establish a long-term incentive plan.  For the following reasons, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff William G. Coll (\"Coll\") sued defendant PB Diagnostic Systems, Inc.  (\"PB\") in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  Coll asserted various claims regarding PB's alleged promise to develop a long-term incentive bonus program in connection with Coll's employment as PB's Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\").  After extensive discovery, the court granted PB's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the parties heatedly dispute many of the issues on appeal, the facts central to our inquiry are largely uncontroverted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The defendant, PB, was founded in 1985 to develop and market medical diagnostic instruments.  PB was started as a joint venture owned in equal shares by Polaroid Corporation (\"Polaroid\") and a German company called Behringwerke, A.G.  (\"Behring\").  In 1987, PB representatives contacted the plaintiff, Coll, and informed him that PB was looking for a CEO to run the start-up company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Pre-hire statements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coll agreed to an interview to discuss the position, and met with PB Board Chairman Peter Kliem (\"Kliem\") and Polaroid's Donald Fronzaglia (\"Fronzaglia\") at the Pillar House restaurant.  Coll expressed concern that PB would not be able to offer him an equity share in the company because it was a \"50/50\" joint venture.  Kliem confirmed that PB could not offer an equity share in the company, but explained that PB intended to create a Long Term Incentive Plan (\"LTIP\") that would give the CEO the opportunity to earn up to $1,000,000 provided that PB met certain performance goals.  Kliem indicated that PB did not yet have the LTIP in place, but that the company looked forward to developing it with the new CEO.  In his deposition, Coll admits that he understood this to mean that any payout under the LTIP would be contingent upon the achievement of yet-to-be-defined performance goals.  Coll also testified that he understood that PB had not yet extended him an employment offer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The offer letters</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After meeting with several other PB representatives, Coll determined that he was interested in managing PB.  On December 4, 1987, Kliem sent Coll a letter offering Coll the CEO position at PB (the \"First Offer Letter\").  The First Offer Letter set forth the salary and annual bonus to be paid Coll, and further stated:  \"It is our intent, that in 1989, we would jointly engage in establishing criteria to appropriately reflect your direct contribution to the success of the venture in 1990.\"   Coll called Fronzaglia and expressed his concern that the First Offer Letter did not adequately address the LTIP or what would happen in the event that the venture failed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Coll's concerns, Kliem sent Coll another offer letter, dated December 14, 1989 (the \"Second Offer Letter\").  This letter stated:As we have discussed, we are pleased to confirm our offer of employment as General Manager, PB Diagnostic Systems, Inc.  (PBDS, Inc.)....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You will be an employee of PBDS, Inc. at a starting salary of $160,000.00 per year, with a guaranteed bonus of $40,000.00 per year for 1988 and 1989, payable on your first and second anniversary of employment.

During this conversation, Fronzaglia said:  \"Does that take care of it?\"   Coll replied, \"You and I understand what it is, so I guess it's O.K.\"   Coll admitted in his deposition that at that time he believed that the Second Offer Letter incorporated all the terms and conditions of his employment, and that he believed that there was no material difference between the First and Second Offer Letters with regard to the LTIP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Coll's tenure at PB</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1988, the PB Board of Directors formed a Compensation Committee to develop compensation packages for PB's senior executives.  In April 1989, the Compensation Committee developed an executive compensation proposal which included an Annual Bonus Plan and a LTIP.  The proposal, which was shown to Coll prior to being presented to the Board of Directors, included a payout package that gave Coll the opportunity to earn over $1,000,000 in incentive compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 20, 1989, PB's Board of Directors met and unanimously approved both the Annual Bonus Plan and the LTIP.  Payout under the LTIP was contingent upon the achievement of certain long term goals, described in the LTIP as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Milestones as developed by PBDS in accordance with the business plan and subject to approval of the Board.

The relevant minutes from this meeting read:  \"Various compensation and incentive matters were discussed and approved.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1990, Coll presented his revised five-year business plan for PB, projecting \"profitability\" and \"positive cash flow\" by the end of 1992.  A year later, it became clear that PB would not meet the profitability and positive cash flow goals embodied in the revised five-year plan.  To the contrary, PB suffered tremendous losses in the years 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992.  On April 4, 1991, Coll wrote to the Compensation Committee, proposing to lower the original goals of the LTIP:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This memo will address several issues related to the [LTIP] and to the discussion points raised at the Compensation Committee meeting on March 27, 1991....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  The goals originally established for the 1992 payout of the [LTIP] are conceptually satisfactory.   The goal of \"entrance into the US market\" is already met and the goal of \"entrance into the European market\" is well underway.  Perhaps the more critical goals are, however, \"profitability\" and \"positive cash flow.\"   I believe that we should use the concepts of profitability and positive cash flow, but that we should look at these numbers not as absolute dollar amounts within absolute time-frames, but as measures of progress against marketplace, product and business goals.  To state that \"our goal is to become profitable and to have positive cash flow by Q4, 1992\" is an excellent tool to motivate managers and their organizations and we have communicated profitability and cash flow goals and responsibilities to our employees....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, we will not use these tools indiscriminately and without the concurrence of the Board.  Further, we agree that we must continuously show positive results in profitability and cash flow.  As a result, the management should be measured against its ability to deliver positive profitability on the incremental shipments/revenue that are made in 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, my recommendations for the goals are</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">--entrance into US market</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">--entrance into European market</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">--25% operating profit on incremental 1991 to 1992 revenues</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PB's Board of Directors was scheduled to meet on September 5, 1991.  Just prior to this meeting, Coll submitted a lengthy memo in which he again proposed to lower the targets of the LTIP.  He informed the Board that the current targets of the LTIP were unattainable and that, therefore, the LTIP was unlikely to create the desired incentives.  He urged the Board to lower the targets of the LTIP so that there would be a potential in 1992 for payout under the LTIP.  In pertinent part, the memo read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>Background:  In 1989 the Board approved the basic Long Term Incentive (LTI) plan concepts, including the split of goals to effect 1992 and 1994 payments.

Coll's termination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 14, 1992, Coll's employment at PB was terminated by unanimous decision of the Board of Directors.  PB wrote Coll, explaining that the sponsor companies--Polaroid and Behring--were disappointed with PB's business performance.  Nevertheless, the letter explained, because Coll's termination was due in part to corporate restructuring, PB would pay Coll one year's salary as a lump sum severance payment, in accordance with his employment contract.  Moreover, the letter continued, \"in the unlikely event of a payout under the long term bonus plan, you will be eligible for participation on a pro-rated basis.\"   PB never achieved the two of the four goals originally proposed by Coll to be the 1992 targets of the LTIP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

The Contract Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crux of Coll's breach of contract claim is that PB breached its agreement to implement a long-term incentive plan.

The court held that the contract merely obligated PB to \"jointly explore ... appropriate methods of compensation to reflect [Coll's] contribution to the success of the venture in 1990 and beyond,\" and that PB had fulfilled this obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pertinent law is well settled.  \"Under Massachusetts law, interpretation of a contract is ordinarily a question of law for the court.\"  Fairfield 274-278 Clarendon Trust v.

He relies on his contractual negotiations as evidence that PB intended to obligate itself to create a LTIP that would provide Coll with the opportunity to earn at least $1,000,000 in incentive compensation.  To prevail on this theory, Coll initially must show either (1) that his employment contract with PB was not an integrated agreement with respect to incentive compensation, or (2) that the contractual language is consistent with his assertions.  We think he has done neither.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All the relevant evidence indicates that the employment contract was an integrated and final expression of the parties' agreement with respect to compensation matters.  The agreement lists Coll's base salary, his annual bonus, his severance compensation, and a non-competition agreement.  In short, the face of the document contains nothing that would indicate that the parties did not intend it to be a complete and final expression of their rights and obligations.  Moreover, Coll admitted in his deposition that he thought at the time that the contract embodied all the material terms and conditions of his employment.  Given these considerations, we find that Coll's employment agreement was an integrated document subject to the tenets of the parol evidence rule, and as such must be enforced according to its terms unless the terms are ambiguous on their face.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coll asserts that the relevant contractual language is ambiguous and should be submitted to the jury to determine whether it obligated PB to develop a LTIP and communicate its goals to Coll.  We disagree.  The clear language of the contract states only that PB \"intend[s] to jointly explore with [Coll] appropriate methods of compensation.\"   Any ambiguity in this language centers around whether it obligates PB to do anything.   Assuming it creates a binding obligation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the language clearly does not support Coll's assertions.  To turn the words \"we intend to jointly explore appropriate methods of compensation\" into a binding obligation to develop, fund, and implement a LTIP that would provide up to $1,000,000 of incentive compensation would be completely at odds with the common and natural meaning of the words.  Rather, we assume that the parties intended what they wrote:  that PB intended to make a good faith effort to explore an appropriate compensation package for Coll, including incentive bonuses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence presented for summary judgment demonstrates clearly that PB fulfilled this obligation.  Not only did it explore new incentive packages, it developed and funded a LTIP plan for Coll and his senior executives.  And although Coll disputes the point, the evidence shows that Coll himself proposed the plan's goals, which PB failed to meet under his stewardship.  Under these circumstances, there was no breach of contract and summary judgment on that claim was certainly appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Specifically, Coll alleges that during contract negotiations PB promised to develop a LTIP in order to persuade Coll to accept the CEO position at PB.  The district court rejected Coll's promissory estoppel claim, holding that Coll could not have reasonably relied on the pre-hire discussions regarding the LTIP.

Coll's employment offer was clearly at odds with his understanding of PB's prior oral representations regarding long-term compensation.  Upon receipt of the First Offer Letter, Coll called PB and raised his concern that the language in the offer did not seem to obligate PB to create a LTIP that could pay him up to $1,000,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  When the Second Offer Letter essentially rephrased the same noncommittal language contained in its predecessor, Coll should have been aware that there was a potential disagreement over the LTIP.  Nevertheless, Coll acquiesced to the language in the Second Offer Letter, purportedly because he did not want PB to think that he did not trust them.  He cannot now second-guess his negotiating strategy and claim the benefit of a bargain he did not negotiate.  As we discussed above, the language in the Second Offer Letter clearly did not obligate PB to do anything more than explore the feasibility of a LTIP.  Moreover, Coll admitted that, despite the concerns he had raised, he recognized that the terms of the offer letters were essentially identical regarding long-term compensation.  In short, PB's refusal to \"firm up\" the language regarding long-term compensation rendered any reliance on prior oral representations unreasonable.

Brief for Appellant at 44.  The undisputed facts do not support this contention.  Coll's own writings indicate that two of the four goals of the LTIP would not be met, and that there was thus no potential for payout in 1992 under the LTIP:  \"Half of the goals ... will not be met....  Profitability and positive cash flow are now forecast for 1993, not 1992.  The retentive and motivational capabilities of the LTI are therefore compromised for 1992....\"  The Board's minutes echo this:  \"A management proposal to replace the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan was considered.  The existing Plan appears unlikely to produce incentive compensation payments under the Company's present business forecasts.\"   Accordingly, we agree with the district court that Coll's termination did not strip him of compensation due for past services, and affirm the dismissal of Coll's wrongful termination claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered the other issues raised by Coll and find them equally meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Much of the factual background recited here comes from PB's Statement of Material Facts Concerning Which There Is No Genuine Triable Issue, the remainder coming from our scrutiny of the exhibits and depositions</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> \"(1) A binding integrated agreement discharges prior agreements to the extent that it is inconsistent with them.
