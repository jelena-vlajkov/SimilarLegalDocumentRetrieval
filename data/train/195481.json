We\n\naffirm substantially for the reasons stated in the magistrate\n\njudge's August  23, 1933  recommended decision, adding  these\n\ncomments.\n\n          1.  We  agree that the district attorney was immune\n\nfrom  damages liability with  respect to his  decision not to\n\nprosecute  appellant.   Harrington v.  Almy, 977 F.2d  37, 40\n                                           \n\n(1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          2.   We turn  to appellant's false  arrest, illegal\n\ndetainment, and illegal search and seizure claims against the\n\npolice department.  Citing to Monell v. Department of  Social\n                                                             \n\nServices, 436  U.S. 658, 690 (1978),  the magistrate's report\n        \n\ncorrectly informed  Murray that these claims  were subject to\n\ndismissal  because  liability  could  not  be imposed  absent\n\nallegations  that  the  harm  was inflicted  pursuant  to  an\n\nofficial policy  or custom.  Despite that notice, Murray made\n\nno  attempt to  correct  the complaint's  deficiency.   There\n\nsimply  are no allegations,  as there must be  to sustain a  \n\n1983 suit,  linking a  department policy  or custom  with any\n\nconstitutional violation.   Monell,  436 U.S. at  691-94; see\n                                                             \n\nalso Canton v.

Because the magistrate's report provided\n\nappellant   with   sufficient  notice   of   his  complaint's\n\ndeficiencies, and because appellant failed timely  to correct\n\nthose  inadequacies, the  complaint  was properly  dismissed.\n\nPurvis  v.
