We  have  before  us  a motion  by\n                     \n\nappellant  denominated  \"motion  for  a  stay  or  injunction\n\npending appeal,\" and a  cross-motion by defendant \"to dismiss\n\nthe appeal.\"  We construe these filings as cross-motions  for\n\nsummary disposition.\n\n          Appellant Cassell was convicted  in a New Hampshire\n\nstate court of  felonious sexual assault.  While his criminal\n\nconviction  was pending  on  direct appeal,  he brought  this\n\naction  for damages under 42 U.S.C.   1983, alleging that the\n\ndefendant had  conspired with the police  to falsify evidence\n\nand otherwise cause the  plaintiff to be wrongfully convicted\n\nin the state case.   The district court initially determined,\n\non  a preliminary review of  the complaint under  28 U.S.C.  \n\n1915, and  circuit precedent, that the  federal damages claim\n\nshould be stayed pending exhaustion by plaintiff of his state\n\nremedies.   Shortly  thereafter, however,  the Supreme  Court\n\nresolved  a conflict among the  circuits by ruling  that \"a  \n\n1983  cause   of  action  for  damages   attributable  to  an\n\nunconstitutional  conviction  does   not  accrue  until   the\n                                                \n\nconviction  . . . has  been invalidated.\"   Heck v. Humphrey,\n                                                            \n\n114  S. Ct.  2364,  2373 (1994)  (emphasis  added); see  also\n                                                             \n\nGuzman-Rivera v.  Rivera-Cruz, 29 F.3d 3, 5  (1st Cir. 1994).\n                             \n\nThe district court then correctly determined that application\n\nof  the Supreme  Court's decision  required the  dismissal of\n\nplaintiff's claim as premature.\n\n          Plaintiff's  motion indicates  that he  is somewhat\n\nconfused  about the  effect of  the  dismissal.   We explain,\n\nfirst,  that plaintiff  is  not prejudiced  by the  dismissal\n\nbecause  it does not prevent  him from later  filing a proper\n\nand timely complaint  for damages should he  first succeed in\n\nhaving his conviction reversed on direct appeal, expunged, or\n\notherwise declared  invalid by a tribunal  authorized to make\n\nsuch a determination.  Id.  Second, plaintiff is incorrect in\n                          \n\nassuming that the dismissal  violates this court's mandate in\n\nan earlier appeal filed by plaintiff in another case.  Appeal\n\nno. 93-16O7 (one of  three consolidated appeals) involved the\n\ndismissal,  by  a different  district  judge,  of a  separate\n\nlawsuit in  which plaintiff  had named  different defendants.\n\nOur  remand of  that  case for  further  consideration as  to\n\nwhether some  of the claims  should be stayed,  also predated\n\nthe  Supreme  Court's decision  in Heck.    The effect  of an\n                                       \n\nintervening Supreme  Court decision on claims  pending in the\n\ndistrict  court at  the time  of the  decision is  a question\n\ncommitted  in  the first  instance  to  the particular  judge\n\npresiding over each case.\n\n          Finding no substantial  question presented, and for\n\nthe reasons  articulated in  the district court's  order, the\n\njudgment below is affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.  \n                                \n\n                             -3-\n",
