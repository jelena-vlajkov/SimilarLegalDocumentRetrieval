The United States Environmental\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\nProtection Agency (EPA), respondent before us, refused to hold an\n\nevidentiary hearing regarding  its determination that a  facility\n\nin  Mayaguez owned by petitioner,  Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer\n\nAuthority  (PRASA),  must  fully   meet  the  Clean  Water  Act's\n\nsecondary  treatment requirements  for  publicly owned  treatment\n\nworks (POTWs).  The  gist of EPA's decision  was straightforward:\n\nhaving  previously  established secondary  treatment requirements\n\nbecause PRASA's POTW emitted  pollutants into stressed waters, it\n\ndetermined  that   PRASA  had  failed  to   proffer  any  legally\n\ncognizable basis for modifying the requirements.\n\n          Petitioner   now   seeks   judicial  review   of   this\n\ndetermination.   Its flagship objection  demands that we place in\n\nbold  relief the  concept  of  administrative  summary  judgment.\n\nPetitioner's  less  touted   objections  implicate  the  agency's\n\n\"stressed  waters\"  standards.1    Descrying  no  flaw  in  EPA's\n\napplication of either its procedural  or substantive regulations,\n\nwe affirm.\n\nI.  STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK\n\n          Under the Clean Water Act,  no pollutant may be emitted\n\ninto this  nation's waters except  in compliance with  a National\n\nPollution Discharge  Elimination System  (NPDES) permit.   See 33\n                                                              \n\nU.S.C.    1311(a) (1988).  Ordinarily, the NPDES permit issued to\n\n                    \n\n     1\"Stressed  waters\"  are  \"those  receiving  environments in\nwhich an applicant  can demonstrate  to the  satisfaction of  the\nAdministrator,  that  the  absence   of  a  balanced,  indigenous\npopulation is caused solely by human perturbations other than the\napplicant's modified discharge.\"  40 C.F.R.   125.58(t) (1993).\n\n                                2\n\na  POTW  includes  certain technology-based  standards  known  as\n\nsecondary treatment  requirements.  See  id.   1311(b)(1)(B).   A\n                                            \n\nPOTW can  obtain relief from  these requirements by  meeting nine\n\nseparate  criteria.   These criteria  are limned  in 33  U.S.C.  \n\n1311(h).     They   require   the  applicant   to  make   various\n\ndemonstrations  regarding matters  such as:   the effects  of the\n\ndischarge  on  other sources  and on  marine life;  standards and\n\nprocedures for monitoring the  discharge; and methods of ensuring\n\ncontrol over the  sources introducing  waste into the  POTW.   Of\n\nthis  ennead,  only the  second  criterion,  embodied in  section\n\n1311(h)(2), is relevant to this appeal.2\n\n          To satisfy section 1311(h)(2), a POTW must show that\n\n          the  discharge  of  pollutants in  accordance\n          with  such  modified  requirements  will  not\n          interfere,  alone  or  in   combination  with\n          pollutants  from  other  sources,   with  the\n          attainment  or  maintenance  of   that  water\n          quality  which  assures protection  of public\n          water   supplies   and  the   protection  and\n          propagation   of   a   balanced,   indigenous\n          population of shellfish, fish,  and wildlife,\n          and allows recreational activities, in and on\n          the water . . . .\n\n33 U.S.C.   1311(h)(2)  (1988).  The information necessary  for a\n\nsection 1311(h)(2) demonstration is described by the implementing\n\n                    \n\n     2While EPA's initial decision may be read to rest in part on\nPRASA's failure to satisfy  subsections 1311(h)(1) and (h)(9), as\nwell  as (h)(2), the  Environmental Appeals  Board did  not reach\nthose issues, see In re Mayaguez Regional Sewage Treatment Plant,\n                                                                \nNPDES Appeal No.  92-93 (August  23, 1993), slip  op. at 9  n.13.\nSince the  initial decision constitutes final  agency action only\nwhen  the Board denies review or summarily affirms, see 40 C.F.R.\n                                                       \n  124.91(f)  (1993), not where, as here,  the Board writes a full\nopinion,  we decline  EPA's invitation  that  we decide  the case\nunder either (h)(1) or (h)(9).\n\n                                3\n\nregulation,  under  which  an   applicant  who  cannot  meet  the\n\nrequirements  of   40  C.F.R.     125.61(a)-(e)   due  to  \"human\n\nperturbations\" other  than its  modified discharge must  meet the\n\nstressed waters  requirements of  40 C.F.R.    125.61(f).   Under\n\nthese  requirements,  the  applicant  must  demonstrate  that its\n\ndischarge will not:\n\n          (1)  contribute  to, increase,  or perpetuate\n          such stressed conditions;\n\n          (2)  contribute to further degradation of the\n          biota or water quality  if the level of human\n          perturbation  from  other sources  increases;\n          and\n\n          (3) retard the recovery of the biota or water\n          quality  if the  level of  human perturbation\n          from other sources decreases.\n\n40  C.F.R.    125.61(f) (1993).   For  ease of  comprehension, we\n\nsometimes  will  refer  to  the (f)(1)  showing  as  the \"current\n\nimpacts\" showing and the  (f)(3) showing as the \"future  impacts\"\n\nshowing.  Although the (f)(2) showing would seem to be intimately\n\nrelated  to the  (f)(3)  showing, it  was  not discussed  in  the\n\nproceedings  below and,  therefore, is  not a  matter of  current\n\nconcern.\n\n          Unlike  typical NPDES  permit proceedings, EPA  makes a\n\ntentative decision to grant or deny section 1311(h) modifications\n\nprior to proposing a  permit.  See 40 C.F.R.    125.59(d) (1993).\n                                  \n\nA  POTW  that  has  submitted  a  timely   application  for  such\n\nmodification  may  revise  it once  as  of  right.    See  id.   \n                                                              \n\n125.59(d)(1).  EPA also  may authorize or request  the submission\n\nof additional information.  See id.   125.59(f)(1).\n                                   \n\n                                4\n\n          After  issuance of  a tentative  decision, followed  by\n\npublic notice  and opportunity for  written comment, EPA  makes a\n\nfinal determination in  regard to  the proposed action.   See  40\n                                                             \n\nC.F.R.    124.15 (1993).  That decision becomes the final permit,\n\neffective in thirty days, unless it is administratively appealed.\n\nSee id.    124.15(b).  If an appeal is taken, a party may request\n       \n\nan evidentiary hearing to contest the  resolution of any question\n\nraised in  the earlier proceedings.   See  id.   124.74(a).   The\n                                              \n\nrequest must  specifically identify the legal  and factual issues\n\nand  their relevance to the permit decision.  Id.   124.75(b)(1).\n                                                 \n\nEPA's Regional  Administrator then grants or  denies the request.\n\nId.   124.75(a)(1).\n   \n\n          If a request  for an evidentiary hearing is denied, the\n\ndenial  becomes final agency  action within thirty  days unless a\n\nprotest  is  filed  with  the Environmental  Appeals  Board  (the\n\nBoard).   See id.    124.60(c)(5), 124.91.   In turn, an order by\n                 \n\nthe   Board   abjuring   review   renders  final   the   Regional\n\nAdministrator's previous decision.  See id.   124.91(f)(1).\n                                           \n\nII.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n          This case aptly  illustrates how the  regulatory scheme\n\nworks.  PRASA initially sought a section 1311(h) modification for\n\nits Mayaguez  sewage facility by application  dated September 13,\n\n1979.   EPA,  hampered by  delays in  obtaining input  from local\n\nenvironmental officials,  did not issue a tentative denial of the\n\nrequest  until February  6, 1984.   One  year later,  after PRASA\n\npresented  a revised  application,  EPA issued  another tentative\n\n                                5\n\ndenial.  On December  13, 1991, following notice, comment,  and a\n\ntwo-day public  hearing, EPA  dashed PRASA's  hopes by  issuing a\n\nfinal denial of its request for modification.\n\n          Hope,  of course, often  springs eternal, see Alexander\n                                                       \n\nPope, An  Essay on Man,  Epistle 1  (1734), and PRASA's  hopes of\n                      \n\nobtaining  a modification were renewed in 1992 by a United States\n\nGeological Survey (USGS) report  that contained some  conclusions\n\nhelpful  to PRASA's  cause.   PRASA commenced  its administrative\n\nappeal  of  EPA's final  denial by  submitting  a request  for an\n\nevidentiary hearing accompanied by the draft USGS study.  On July\n\n23, 1992, the USGS report notwithstanding, EPA Region II rejected\n\nPRASA's request for an evidentiary hearing.  The  Board affirmed.\n\nSee In re  Mayaguez Regional Sewage Treatment Plant, NPDES Appeal\n                                                   \n\nNo. 92-93  (August  23, 1993)  (Board  Op.).   PRASA  immediately\n\ninvoked 33 U.S.C.   1369(b) and petitioned for judicial review.\n\n          In a  passage that  frames the central  battleground in\n\nthis venue, the  Board self-consciously construed the  procedural\n\nstandard governing requests for evidentiary hearings, 40 C.F.R.  \n\n124.75,  to necessitate  the  presence  of  a \"genuine  issue  of\n\nmaterial fact\" as a  prerequisite to avoiding summary disposition\n\nof requests for review, Board Op. at 11.  The Board characterized\n\nthis requirement as \"very similar to the requirement set forth in\n\nRule 56  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\"  Id.; see also\n                                                                 \n\nid.  at 13 (explaining that the Board's  standard and the Rule 56\n   \n\nstandard are \"for our purposes virtually identical\").  Warming to\n\nthe task,  the Board  lauded case  law  dealing with  Rule 56  as\n\n                                6\n\noffering \"useful guidance\" in connection with section 124.75, id.\n                                                                 \n\nat  11, and  proclaimed  that the  Rule  56 standard  \"should  be\n\napplied in the context of evidentiary hearing requests  as well,\"\n\nid. at 13.\n   \n\n          Scrutinizing the  record through this  prism, the Board\n\nheld  that PRASA  did  not merit  a  hearing because  it had  not\n\npresented  a  genuine issue  of material  fact  as to  either the\n\ncurrent impacts  showing required under 40  C.F.R.   125.61(f)(1)\n\nor  the  future  impacts  showing  required  under  40  C.F.R.   \n\n125.61(f)(3).    Put  another  way,  the  Board  thought  that no\n\nevidentiary  hearing should  be  convened because  PRASA had  not\n\nadduced sufficient  proof from which  a reasonable  decisionmaker\n\ncould  find, by a preponderance of the evidence,3 either that the\n\nMayaguez  POTW was  not  currently contributing  to the  stressed\n\ncondition of the surrounding  waters, or that the facility  would\n\nnot in the  future inhibit recovery  of the surrounding  stressed\n\nwaters in the event that other stresses relented.  See id. at 15-\n                                                          \n\n18.  This ruling was tantamount to the entry of summary judgment,\n\neffectively terminating PRASA's administrative appeal.\n\nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n          We are mindful that we operate at the busy intersection\n\nof  three deferential standards of  review.  In  the first place,\n\n                    \n\n     3The Board routinely  applies the preponderance  standard in\npermit determinations.   See Board  Op. at 13  n.18.  This  is of\n                            \nsome consequence for present  purposes because Rule 56 frequently\nimplicates the substantive burdens  of proof that would  apply if\nthe particular  case went forward uninterrupted.   See Villanueva\n                                                                 \nv.

Ct. 181 (1991).\n\n                                7\n\nagency decisions  made by informal adjudication may  be set aside\n\nonly if they are \"arbitrary,  capricious, an abuse of discretion,\n\nor otherwise not in accordance  with law.\"  5 U.S.C.    706(2)(A)\n\n(1988); see also  Motor Vehicle  Mfrs. Ass'n v.  State Farm  Mut.\n                                                                 \n\nAuto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983); Sierra Club v. Marsh, 976\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 763,  769 (1st Cir. 1992).   In the second  place, an agency\n\ndeserves an extra  measure of  deference with  regard to  factual\n\nquestions involving scientific matters  in its area of expertise.\n\nSee, e.g.,  Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec.  Co. v. NRDC, 462  U.S. 87, 103\n                                              \n\n(1983); FPC  v. Florida  Power &amp;  Light Co.,  404  U.S. 453,  463\n                                           \n\n(1972); Town of Brookline  v. Gorsuch, 667 F.2d 215,  219-20 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1981).   Mixed questions  of law and  fact, at least  to the\n\nextent that they are fact-dominated, fall under this rubric.  See\n                                                                 \n\nGorsuch, 667  F.2d at 220; cf.

And,  finally, the  respect\n\nusually accorded an  agency's interpretation of  a statute it  is\n\ncharged to execute,  see Chevron  U.S.A. Inc. v.

Oklahoma,  112  S. Ct.\n                                                   \n\n1046, 1059-60 (1992); Commonwealth of Mass., DPW  v.

ADMINISTRATIVE SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n          In this court,  PRASA hawks most vigorously a  claim of\n\n                                8\n\nprocedural   error.      This  claim   spotlights   the   Board's\n\ninterpretation of  EPA's standard  for dispensing  (or dispensing\n\nwith) evidentiary hearings,  especially its  conclusion that  the\n\ntext  of  the applicable  regulation,  40  C.F.R.    124.75(a)(1)\n\n(stipulating that, to warrant  an evidentiary hearing and deflect\n\nadministrative  summary  judgment,   the  non-moving  party  must\n\nestablish the existence of  \"material issues of fact  relevant to\n\nthe  issuance of the permit\"),  should be read  as the functional\n\nequivalent of  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  56(c) (which  authorizes summary\n\njudgment if there  is \"no genuine issue as to any material fact,\"\n\nand  thereby  requires  the  non-moving party  to  establish  the\n\nexistence  of a  genuinely  disputed material  fact to  forestall\n\nsummary judgment).   Section  124.75, PRASA asserts,  contains no\n\n\"genuineness\" requirement,  and, moreover, even if  the Board had\n\nthe  authority  to  read  a \"genuineness\"  requirement  into  the\n\nregulation, it could not do so without giving advance notice.  We\n\nfind no merit in these assertions.\n\n         The Structure of Administrative Summary Judgment\n                                                         \n\n          In erecting an adjudicatory framework that included  an\n\nadministrative  summary  judgment   procedure,  EPA   necessarily\n\ncontemplated that, to qualify for an evidentiary hearing, a party\n\nwould have to present a genuine and  material dispute.  Those two\n\nrequirements are  inherent in the very  concept of administrative\n\nsummary  judgment.     Any   other  assumption  borders   on  the\n\nchimerical:  under  federal case  law, a \"material\"  fact is  one\n\nthat  may affect the outcome of the case, see Anderson v. Liberty\n                                                                 \n\n                                9\n\nLobby,  Inc.,  477 U.S.  242, 248  (1986);  United States  v. One\n                                                                 \n\nParcel of  Real Property, 960 F.2d  200, 204 (1st Cir.  1992);  a\n                        \n\n\"genuine\"  fact dispute  is one  that a  reasonable decisionmaker\n\ncould decide  in  favor  of either  party  under  the  applicable\n\nstandard of proof, or in other words, one that is worthy of being\n\nmore  fully  adjudicated (trialworthy  in  the courts'  parlance;\n\nhearing-worthy in  the agencies' parlance).4   See Liberty Lobby,\n                                                                \n\n477  U.S. at 248-49;  One Parcel, 960  F.2d at 204.   To force an\n                                \n\nagency fully to adjudicate a  dispute that is patently frivolous,\n\nor that can  be resolved in  only one  way, or that  can have  no\n\nbearing  on the disposition of  the case, would  be mindless, and\n\nwould  suffocate the root purpose for  making available a summary\n\nprocedure.    Indeed, to  argue    as  does petitioner     that a\n\nspeculative  or purely theoretical  dispute    in other  words, a\n\nnon-genuine  dispute     can  derail summary  judgment  is  sheer\n\npersiflage.\n\n          We think that EPA's regulations lawfully can be read to\n\nincorporate   this  binary   test,   featuring  genuineness   and\n\nmateriality.   What  is  more,  we  refuse to  attach  talismanic\n\nsignificance to the absence of the stock phrase \"genuine issue of\n\nmaterial  fact.\"  The reference found in 40 C.F.R.   124.75(a)(1)\n\nto \"material\"  issues of  \"relevant\" fact achieves  precisely the\n\nsame  end.   In  practice, courts  and  agencies regularly  use a\n\nvariety of terms to describe the two pillars of summary judgment.\n\n                    \n\n     4While these definitions developed in the milieu of Rule 56,\nthey are by no means limited to that milieu.\n\n                                10\n\n          We  hasten   to  add  that,  despite   this  linguistic\n\nequivalency,  explicitly   drawing  a   connection  to   Rule  56\n\naccomplishes  three   things.    First,  it   provides  a  common\n\nvocabulary,  easily understandable  by  litigants,  lawyers,  and\n\nadjudicators.     Second,   it   introduces  into   an   agency's\n\njurisprudence  a  ready-made  ensemble of  decisional  precedents\n\nassociated with Rule 56,  see, e.g., Garside v. Osco  Drug, Inc.,\n                                                                \n\n895 F.2d  46, 48  (1st Cir.  1990) (holding  that at  the summary\n\njudgment  stage the evidence must  be examined in  the light most\n\nfavorable to the nonmovant).   Third, it carries with  it certain\n\nexpectations,  conditioned by everyday  experience in the federal\n\ncourts, about the kind and degree of evidence deemed necessary to\n\ncreate  a genuine  dispute  over a  material  fact.   See,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nLiberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at  249-50 (explaining that to  withstand\n             \n\nsummary  judgment, evidence  must be  \"significantly probative\");\n\nGarside, 895 F.2d at  49-50 (discussing type and kind  of opinion\n       \n\nevidence that may forestall summary judgment).\n\n          Notwithstanding  the obvious  advantages  of drawing  a\n\nparallel  between  the  courts'  and the  agencies'  versions  of\n\nsummary judgment, petitioner contends that the Board went too far\n\ntoo fast.  In support, PRASA posits three interrelated arguments:\n\n(1) that summary  judgment, as it  exists in  the courts, has  no\n\nlegitimate  place in  agency  practice;  (2) that  administrative\n\nsummary  judgment does not carry with it  the baggage of Rule 56;\n\nand (3) that, in  all events, EPA took an  impermissible shortcut\n\nand embraced a Rule  56 standard precipitously, without affording\n\n                                11\n\nfair notice or an  opportunity to respond.  These  arguments lack\n\nforce.\n\n         The Validity of Administrative Summary Judgment\n                                                        \n\n          The   choice  between   summary   judgment   and   full\n\nadjudication   in virtually any context   reflects a balancing of\n\nthe  value  of  efficiency against  the  values  of  accuracy and\n\nfairness.    Seen in  that  light, summary  judgment  often makes\n\nespecially  good sense in an administrative forum, for, given the\n\nvolume  of   matters  coursing  through  an   agency's  hallways,\n\nefficiency is perhaps  more central to an agency than to a court.\n\nSee Charles  C. Ames  &amp; Steven  C. McCracken,  Framing Regulatory\n                                                                 \n\nStandards to Avoid Formal Adjudication:  The FDA As a Case Study,\n                                                                \n\n64  Cal. L.  Rev. 14, 34-35  (1976).   At the  same time, summary\n\njudgment  is less  jarring in  the administrative  context; after\n\nall,  even  under  optimal  conditions, agencies  do  not  afford\n\nparties  full-dress  jury  trials.   Taking  these  factors  into\n\naccount, it  is  unsurprising that  most  major agencies  in  the\n\nfederal system  have opted to  make available procedures  for the\n\nsummary  disposition  of adjudicatory  matters.    See, e.g.,  10\n                                                            \n\nC.F.R.   2.749  (1994) (NRC); 16  C.F.R.   3.24 (1994)  (FTC); 21\n\nC.F.R.   12.93 (1994) (FDA); 47  C.F.R.   1.251 (1993) (FCC);  40\n\nC.F.R.    22.20, 124.75, 164.91 (1993) (EPA); 29 C.F.R. 102.35(h)\n\n(1993) (NLRB); 29 C.F.R.   2200.2 (1993) (OSHA).5\n\n                    \n\n     5An  important exception is the SEC.

See  Hynson,  412   U.S.  at  621.     It  follows  that\n                    \n\nadministrative  summary  judgment,  properly  configured,  is  an\n\nacceptable procedural device.\n\n               Applicability of Rule 56 Precedents\n                                                  \n\n          Petitioner's   attempt  to   break  the   bond  between\n\nadministrative summary judgment and its courtroom  counterpart is\n\nsimilarly  unavailing.    From  its  inception,  the  concept  of\n\nadministrative summary judgment  has been linked  inextricably to\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56.   In all probability, it was  Professor Davis\n\nwho first forged this link.  He wrote:  \"Some agencies might well\n\ntake a leaf from the federal  rules of civil procedure and permit\n\nsummary  judgment  without evidence  when  no  issue  of fact  is\n\npresented.\"   1 Kenneth C.

Many agencies habitually look to Rule\n\n56 case  law for  guidance in  respect to administrative  summary\n\njudgments.   See, e.g., Phillips  Pipe Line Co.  v. Phillips Pipe\n                                                                 \n\nCo., 1994  FERC LEXIS 757,  at *3 (April  26, 1994)  (applying 18\n   \n\nC.F.R.     385.217);  United  States  v.

Thus,  \"[w]ith  minor individual  modifications,  the\n\n                                15\n\nsummary judgment  procedures should  be similar in  most agencies\n\n[to  those  under   Rule  56].\"     1  Charles   H.

Here,  the record\n\nreflects  neither a departure from precedent nor an alteration of\n\nthe required showing.   To the contrary, the Board's  approach to\n\nsection 124.75 proceeds  naturally from its earlier  construction\n\nof  the provision  and falls  well within  the mainstream  of its\n\npreviously established practice.  We explain briefly.\n\n          Although the  Board never before has  made the equation\n\nbetween Rule 56 and EPA's summary judgment procedure so explicit,\n\nit traditionally  has equated its procedural  standard for denial\n\nof an evidentiary hearing anent an  NPDES permit with the Rule 56\n\nyardstick.    On  at  least  three  prior  occasions,  the  Board\n\nsuggested that section 124.75's  reference to the presentation of\n\n\"material  issues of fact relevant to the issuance of the permit\"\n\nrequires  the nonmovant to set forth a \"genuine issue of material\n\nfact.\"  See  In re City of  Jacksonville, Etc., NPDES  Appeal No.\n                                              \n\n91-19 (Aug. 4,  1992), slip op.  at 2; In  re Miami-Dade Water  &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nSewer Auth.

See,  e.g., In re  Harmon Elecs., Inc.,\n                                                                \n\n1993 RCRA  LEXIS 113 at  *9-*10 (Aug.  17, 1993);  In re  Premier\n                                                                 \n\nMetal  Prods., 1992 RCRA LEXIS 156, at  *2 (Dec. 23, 1992).

FDIC,  934 F.2d  681, 685 (5th  Cir. 1991)  (suggesting\n              \n\nthat administrative  decisionmakers should look  for guidance  to\n\nthe Civil Rules when interpreting regulations containing concepts\n\nor language derived in part from those rules).\n\n          In sum,  the procedure to  which PRASA objects  did not\n\nspring  suddenly and  unannounced from  EPA's bureaucratic  brow.\n\nRather,  by the  time  that the  agency  decided this  case,  the\n\nconcept  that  only  the presence  of  a  genuine  issue about  a\n\nmaterial fact  could forestall brevis disposition  had taken deep\n                                     \n\n                    \n\n     8Great  Lakes is of special  interest, for in  that case the\n                  \nEPA  made manifest that it considered the term \"material\" as used\nin section 124.75 to be akin to the federal courts' definition of\n\"genuine\" under Rule 56.  After making a casual reference to Rule\n56's language, the Board concluded,  using the terms contained in\nsection 124.75, that the petitioner's evidence was \"relevant\" but\nnot \"material.\"   It  was  not \"material,\"  the Board  explained,\nbecause \"evidentiary hearings [should  not] be granted whenever a\nparty  makes a  bare  assertion, without  anything  more, that  a\npermit's monitoring requirements should  be reduced or modified  \nthis would hopelessly crowd hearing dockets and clearly is not in\naccord  with the  purposes of  . .  . the  Agency's regulations.\"\nGreat Lakes, at 14.\n           \n\n                                18\n\nroot in administrative soil.   Thus, PRASA should have  known all\n\nalong that it would be expected to present a genuine and material\n\ndispute  in order  to earn  an evidentiary  hearing.   Though the\n\nBoard  had never before invoked Rule 56  in haec verba as a guide\n                                                      \n\nto  section   124.75,  any  reasonable   litigant  familiar  with\n\nadministrative practice  in general and with  EPA's precedents in\n\nparticular should have anticipated  that it would be  required to\n\npresent evidence  adequate to overcome the  functional equivalent\n\nof a Rule 56 motion.9\n\n          Little more need be said.   The Board's use of Rule  56\n\nhere  was  consistent  both  with its  prior  practice  and  with\n\nprevalent  understandings  of  administrative  summary  judgment.\n\nThus, the Board's  articulation, albeit \"new\" in a certain sense,\n\nfalls well within the range of hitherto  unspoken principles that\n\nappropriately may  be announced  in the  course  of rendering  an\n\nadjudicative determination.  See Bell Aerospace, 416 U.S. at 294;\n                                               \n\nSEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 202-03 (1947); Molina v.

Those restrictions, properly\n\nconstrued,  do  not  lock an  agency  into  a  position where  it\n\n                    \n\n     9In any event, to the  extent (if at all) that  PRASA failed\nto realize that Rule  56 would inform the Board's  decision about\nwhether to  hold a hearing, we fail to see how it was prejudiced.\nFor  aught that appears,  PRASA's evidentiary  presentation would\nnot have  differed; to this date it  has been unable to deterrate\nany proof  sufficient  to create  a  genuine issue  about  either\ncurrent or future impacts.\n\n                                19\n\ninvariably must parrot the same phrases or perpetually chant  the\n\nsame mantra.   Reasonable  refinement and reformulation  are both\n\npermissible   and   advisable  in   administrative  adjudication.\n\nNothing more transpired here.\n\nV.  THE STRESSED WATERS SHOWINGS\n\n          We now move from the procedural to the substantive.  In\n\nscrutinizing  an  order  of  an  agency  denying  an  evidentiary\n\nhearing, a  reviewing court  must determine whether  the agency's\n\nfindings accurately  mirror the record,  and if they  do, whether\n\nthose findings warrant  denial of a  hearing under the  pertinent\n\nregulations.  See Hynson, 412 U.S. at 622.  In this instance, the\n                        \n\nfirst part of the inquiry tells the tale, for, if PRASA failed to\n\npresent  evidence adequate to create  a genuine issue of material\n\nfact  on one or  more critical criteria,  as EPA  found, then EPA\n\nproperly denied the requested hearing.\n\n                    The Future Impacts Showing\n                                              \n\n          Under 40  C.F.R.   125.61(f)(3), it  was incumbent upon\n\nPRASA to show, inter  alia, that the emissions from  the Mayaguez\n                          \n\nPOTW would not \"retard the recovery of the biota or water quality\n\nif the level of human perturbation from other sources decreases.\"\n\nIn  promulgating this  requirement,  EPA recognized  that it  was\n\nerecting  a high hurdle.  Indeed, it  stated in a preamble to the\n\nregulations:\n\n          As a practical  matter, it will be  extremely\n          difficult  for  most  applicants  discharging\n          into  stressed  waters  to  demonstrate  that\n          their discharge will meet the requirements of\n          section  125.61.   As  a factual  matter, the\n          discharge  of  additional pollutants  into an\n\n                                20\n\n          already polluted marine environment virtually\n          always  increases  or contributes  to adverse\n          impact;  it  is  extremely  difficult,  as  a\n          practical matter, to demonstrate that it does\n          not.\n\n44 Fed. Reg. 34,784, 34,806 (June 15, 1979).\n\n          EPA concluded  that PRASA had not  cleared this hurdle,\n\nand the Board concurred.  It noted that the  studies submitted by\n\npetitioner   principally  the USGS  report    addressed only  the\n\ncurrent  impacts  of the  facility's  emissions  relative to  the\n\ncurrent  impacts of all other  emissions, and did  not purport to\n\nmake  predictions regarding future impacts.  See Board Op. at 15-\n                                                \n\n16.  Accordingly, without defining  exactly what type of evidence\n\nmight  surmount  the (f)(3)  hurdle,  the  Board determined  that\n\npetitioner's  effort came up short.   If this determination holds\n\nwater,  then the  agency  had  a  right  summarily  to  deny  the\n\npetition.10\n\n          This  reasoning finds  a striking  parallel in  Hynson.\n                                                                \n\nThere  the  Court  agreed that  an  agency  was  not required  to\n\n\"provide a formal hearing  where it is apparent at  the threshold\n\n                    \n\n     10PRASA  makes a  rather convoluted threshold  argument that\nimplicates the order of the showings which must be made to secure\nmodification of secondary treatment  requirements.  In this case,\nwe  doubt  that the  order of  the  showings makes  the slightest\ndifference.  Moreover, there is absolutely no basis for believing\neither that the showings  must be made in a  particular sequence,\nor that separate hearings must be held for each showing.   Absent\na  contrary indication in the regulation itself   and none exists\nhere   we think  it is fair to assume  that a party must  satisfy\nevery element of  a provision  written in the  conjunctive.

Reg. 9757 (Mar.\n                                        \n\n13, 1974).  Since that time, the courts have upheld FDA's summary\n\ndenials  of hearings  under  this policy.    As the  District  of\n\nColumbia Circuit explained:\n\n          [E]ven  \"a  regulatory provision  which seems\n          vague  in the  abstract  may  nonetheless  be\n          conclusively  at  odds   with  a   peculiarly\n          deficient  item of  evidence.\"   Thus  . .  .\n          summary  judgment may be entered not only for\n          failure to comply  with precise  regulations,\n          but   also   \"on   the   basis   of  manifest\n          noncompliance   with  general   statutory  or\n          regulatory provisions . . . .\"\n\nCopanos,  854  F.2d  at  522  (citations  omitted).    We  agree.\n       \n\nAlthough in  some cases  an imprecise regulation  may require  an\n\nagency to  give an applicant the benefit of the doubt regarding a\n\nsummary  decision, other cases will be so clear-cut as to warrant\n\nsummary  adverse action,  notwithstanding the imprecision  in the\n\nagency's standards.  We  believe the present case falls  into the\n\nheartland of the latter category.\n\n          The Board's reasoning is also hauntingly reminiscent of\n\nButtrey  v. United States, 690  F.2d 1170 (5th  Cir. 1982), cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied, 461 U.S.  927 (1983),  a case involving  the Clean  Water\n      \n\nAct.  There, the court  of appeals agreed that the Army  Corps of\n\n                                22\n\nEngineers  need not  hold a  hearing on  every application  for a\n\npermit  to  discharge dredged  or  fill  material into  navigable\n\nwaters.    Id.  at  1174-83.    One  reason given  was  that  the\n              \n\npetitioner\n\n          apparently decided  not  even to  attempt  to\n          make the three  showings required under  [the\n          applicable    regulations].        Procedural\n          improvements  in  the  nature  of  trial-type\n          safeguards  could do  nothing  to  remedy  so\n          fundamental a flaw in the prima facie case.\n\nId. at 1183 (footnote omitted).\n   \n\n          PRASA  does not deny  that its  studies failed  to draw\n\ndirect  conclusions regarding  future  impacts.11    Instead,  it\n\nattempts to discredit EPA's  interpretation of the future impacts\n\nregulation, labelling  it absolutist.  This  fusillade misses the\n\nmark.      Though   an   absolutist   interpretation,   rendering\n\nmodifications of secondary  treatment requirements for  emissions\n\ninto stressed waters unobtainable,  might well be problematic, we\n\ndo not read the Board's opinion in that fashion.\n\n          In  considering   this  issue,  the  Board  refused  to\n\npresume,  absent scientific  evidence, that  a large  quantity of\n\nlightly treated sewage   estimated  as 850 tons per year    would\n\nhave  no impact on the  surrounding stressed waters  in the event\n\nthat  other stresses  abated.   See  Board Op.  at  15-16.   This\n                                   \n\n                    \n\n     11PRASA does  offhandedly suggest that its  studies make the\nrequisite  showing  indirectly.   Compliance  with (f)(1),  PRASA\n                              \nmuses, might in  some cases  provide a scientific  basis for  the\nprediction required by (f)(3).  While that may (or may not) be so\nin  theory, it  is certainly not  so on  the facts  of this case.\nHere, PRASA's showing of no current impacts was weak at best, see\n                                                                 \ninfra  note 12,  and cannot  support the  weight of  the proposed\n     \ninference.\n\n                                23\n\nneither  betokens  an  absolutist   mindset  nor  forecloses  the\n\npossibility that  the Board might  entertain a presumption  of no\n\nfuture  harm  if  presented  with  the  prospect  of more  modest\n\nemissions.     Nor  does   the  Board's  opinion   foreclose  the\n\npossibility  that it might find a scientific showing of no future\n\nimpacts  to be persuasive.   On the contrary,  after noting EPA's\n\n\"great reluctance\"  to sanction  emissions into stressed  waters,\n\nthe Board made a point of leaving the door ajar:\n\n          This  is not  to say  that there  is no  case\n          where discharges into  stressed waters  would\n          be   allowed.     Where,  for   example,  the\n          receiving waters are  stressed by  pollutants\n          other  than those  in the  proposed discharge\n          and  such pollutants  do  not  contribute  to\n          existing stresses,  a   301(h)  permit may be\n          appropriate.\n\nId. at 18 &amp; n.22.\n   \n\n          To say more  would be to  paint the lily.   We conclude\n\nthat  EPA  did  not  promulgate an  absolutist  standard.    And,\n\nmoreover, we find  the Board's  rendition of the  evidence to  be\n\nfaithful  to the  record,  its reasoning  to  be sound,  and  its\n\nposition  to be  well-supported by  authority.   Consequently, we\n\nhold  that the  Board  acted  within  its  authority  in  denying\n\npetitioner an evidentiary  hearing and summarily terminating  the\n\nadministrative appeal on the ground that the studies submitted by\n\npetitioner failed to  make any attempt to  satisfy the strictures\n\nof 40 C.F.R.   125.61(f)(3).12\n\n                    \n\n     12The Board  gave an alternative reason  for upholding EPA's\nrefusal to convene an evidentiary hearing, ruling that petitioner\nfailed to show  that its discharge did not  currently \"contribute\nto,  increase,  or perpetuate  . .  .  stressed conditions.\"   40\n\n                                24\n\nVI.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We  need  go  no  further.    PRASA's  application  for\n\nmodification  and  its  concomitant  request for  an  evidentiary\n\nhearing were  fairly considered and appropriately  rejected.

The  gist of EPA's decision  was straightforward:\n\nhaving  previously  established secondary  treatment requirements\n\nbecause PRASA's POTW emitted  pollutants into stressed waters, it\n\ndetermined  that   PRASA  had  failed  to   proffer  any  legally\n\ncognizable basis for modifying the requirements.\n\n          Petitioner   now   seeks   judicial  review   of   this\n\ndetermination.   Its flagship objection  demands that we place in\n\nbold  relief the  concept  of  administrative  summary  judgment.\n\nPetitioner's  less  touted   objections  implicate  the  agency's\n\n\"stressed  waters\"  standards.1    Descrying  no  flaw  in  EPA's\n\napplication of either its procedural  or substantive regulations,\n\nwe affirm.\n\nI.  STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK\n\n          Under the Clean Water Act,  no pollutant may be emitted\n\ninto this  nation's waters except  in compliance with  a National\n\nPollution Discharge  Elimination System  (NPDES) permit.   See 33\n                                                              \n\nU.S.C.    1311(a) (1988).  Ordinarily, the NPDES permit issued to\n\n                    \n\n     1\"Stressed  waters\"  are  \"those  receiving  environments in\nwhich an applicant  can demonstrate  to the  satisfaction of  the\nAdministrator,  that  the  absence   of  a  balanced,  indigenous\npopulation is caused solely by human perturbations other than the\napplicant's modified discharge.\"  40 C.F.R.   125.58(t) (1993).\n\n                                2\n\na  POTW  includes  certain technology-based  standards  known  as\n\nsecondary treatment  requirements.  See  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>   1311(b)(1)(B).   A\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">                                            \n\nPOTW can  obtain relief from  these requirements by  meeting nine\n\nseparate  criteria.   These criteria  are limned  in 33  U.S.C.  \n\n1311(h).     They   require   the  applicant   to  make   various\n\ndemonstrations  regarding matters  such as:   the effects  of the\n\ndischarge  on  other sources  and on  marine life;  standards and\n\nprocedures for monitoring the  discharge; and methods of ensuring\n\ncontrol over the  sources introducing  waste into the  POTW.   Of\n\nthis  ennead,  only the  second  criterion,  embodied in  section\n\n1311(h)(2), is relevant to this appeal.2\n\n          To satisfy section 1311(h)(2), a POTW must show that\n\n          the  discharge  of  pollutants in  accordance\n          with  such  modified  requirements  will  not\n          interfere,  alone  or  in   combination  with\n          pollutants  from  other  sources,   with  the\n          attainment  or  maintenance  of   that  water\n          quality  which  assures protection  of public\n          water   supplies   and  the   protection  and\n          propagation   of   a   balanced,   indigenous\n          population of shellfish, fish,  and wildlife,\n          and allows recreational activities, in and on\n          the water . . . .\n\n33 U.S.C.   1311(h)(2)  (1988).  The information necessary  for a\n\nsection 1311(h)(2) demonstration is described by the implementing\n\n                    \n\n     2While EPA's initial decision may be read to rest in part on\nPRASA's failure to satisfy  subsections 1311(h)(1) and (h)(9), as\nwell  as (h)(2), the  Environmental Appeals  Board did  not reach\nthose issues, see In re Mayaguez Regional Sewage Treatment Plant,\n                                                                \nNPDES Appeal No.  92-93 (August  23, 1993), slip  op. at 9  n.13.\nSince the  initial decision constitutes final  agency action only\nwhen  the Board denies review or summarily affirms, see 40 C.F.R.\n                                                       \n  124.91(f)  (1993), not where, as here,  the Board writes a full\nopinion,  we decline  EPA's invitation  that  we decide  the case\nunder either (h)(1) or (h)(9).\n\n                                3\n\nregulation,  under  which  an   applicant  who  cannot  meet  the\n\nrequirements  of   40  C.F.R.     125.61(a)-(e)   due  to  \"human\n\nperturbations\" other  than its  modified discharge must  meet the\n\nstressed waters  requirements of  40 C.F.R.    125.61(f).   Under\n\nthese  requirements,  the  applicant  must  demonstrate  that its\n\ndischarge will not:\n\n          (1)  contribute  to, increase,  or perpetuate\n          such stressed conditions;\n\n          (2)  contribute to further degradation of the\n          biota or water quality  if the level of human\n          perturbation  from  other sources  increases;\n          and\n\n          (3) retard the recovery of the biota or water\n          quality  if the  level of  human perturbation\n          from other sources decreases.\n\n40  C.F.R.    125.61(f) (1993).   For  ease of  comprehension, we\n\nsometimes  will  refer  to  the (f)(1)  showing  as  the \"current\n\nimpacts\" showing and the  (f)(3) showing as the \"future  impacts\"\n\nshowing.  Although the (f)(2) showing would seem to be intimately\n\nrelated  to the  (f)(3)  showing, it  was  not discussed  in  the\n\nproceedings  below and,  therefore, is  not a  matter of  current\n\nconcern.\n\n          Unlike  typical NPDES  permit proceedings, EPA  makes a\n\ntentative decision to grant or deny section 1311(h) modifications\n\nprior to proposing a  permit.  See 40 C.F.R.    125.59(d) (1993).\n                                  \n\nA  POTW  that  has  submitted  a  timely   application  for  such\n\nmodification  may  revise  it once  as  of  right.

PRASA initially sought a section 1311(h) modification for\n\nits Mayaguez  sewage facility by application  dated September 13,\n\n1979.   EPA,  hampered by  delays in  obtaining input  from local\n\nenvironmental officials,  did not issue a tentative denial of the\n\nrequest  until February  6, 1984.   One  year later,  after PRASA\n\npresented  a revised  application,  EPA issued  another tentative\n\n                                5\n\ndenial.  On December  13, 1991, following notice, comment,  and a\n\ntwo-day public  hearing, EPA  dashed PRASA's  hopes by  issuing a\n\nfinal denial of its request for modification.\n\n          Hope,  of course, often  springs eternal, see Alexander\n                                                       \n\nPope, An  Essay on Man,  Epistle 1  (1734), and PRASA's  hopes of\n                      \n\nobtaining  a modification were renewed in 1992 by a United States\n\nGeological Survey (USGS) report  that contained some  conclusions\n\nhelpful  to PRASA's  cause.   PRASA commenced  its administrative\n\nappeal  of  EPA's final  denial by  submitting  a request  for an\n\nevidentiary hearing accompanied by the draft USGS study.  On July\n\n23, 1992, the USGS report notwithstanding, EPA Region II rejected\n\nPRASA's request for an evidentiary hearing.  The  Board affirmed.\n\nSee In re  Mayaguez Regional Sewage Treatment Plant, NPDES Appeal\n                                                   \n\nNo. 92-93  (August  23, 1993)  (Board  Op.).   PRASA  immediately\n\ninvoked 33 U.S.C.   1369(b) and petitioned for judicial review.\n\n          In a  passage that  frames the central  battleground in\n\nthis venue, the  Board self-consciously construed the  procedural\n\nstandard governing requests for evidentiary hearings, 40 C.F.R.  \n\n124.75,  to necessitate  the  presence  of  a \"genuine  issue  of\n\nmaterial fact\" as a  prerequisite to avoiding summary disposition\n\nof requests for review, Board Op. at 11.  The Board characterized\n\nthis requirement as \"very similar to the requirement set forth in\n\nRule 56  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\"  Id.; see also\n                                                                 \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  at 13 </span><pre class=\"inline\">(explaining that the Board's  standard and the Rule 56\n   \n\nstandard are \"for our purposes virtually identical\").  Warming to\n\nthe task,  the Board  lauded case  law  dealing with  Rule 56  as\n\n                                6\n\noffering \"useful guidance\" in connection with section 124.75, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>\n                                                                 \n\nat  11, </span><pre class=\"inline\">and  proclaimed  that the  Rule  56 standard  \"should  be\n\napplied in the context of evidentiary hearing requests  as well,\"\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 13</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n   \n\n          Scrutinizing the  record through this  prism, the Board\n\nheld  that PRASA  did  not merit  a  hearing because  it had  not\n\npresented  a  genuine issue  of material  fact  as to  either the\n\ncurrent impacts  showing required under 40  C.F.R.   125.61(f)(1)\n\nor  the  future  impacts  showing  required  under  40  C.F.R.   \n\n125.61(f)(3).    Put  another  way,  the  Board  thought  that no\n\nevidentiary  hearing should  be  convened because  PRASA had  not\n\nadduced sufficient  proof from which  a reasonable  decisionmaker\n\ncould  find, by a preponderance of the evidence,3 either that the\n\nMayaguez  POTW was  not  currently contributing  to the  stressed\n\ncondition of the surrounding  waters, or that the facility  would\n\nnot in the  future inhibit recovery  of the surrounding  stressed\n\nwaters in the event that other stresses relented.  See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 15-\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">                                                          \n\n18.  This ruling was tantamount to the entry of summary judgment,\n\neffectively terminating PRASA's administrative appeal.\n\nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n          We are mindful that we operate at the busy intersection\n\nof  three deferential standards of  review.  In  the first place,\n\n                    \n\n     3The Board routinely  applies the preponderance  standard in\npermit determinations.   See Board  Op. at 13  n.18.  This  is of\n                            \nsome consequence for present  purposes because Rule 56 frequently\nimplicates the substantive burdens  of proof that would  apply if\nthe particular  case went forward uninterrupted.

ADMINISTRATIVE SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n          In this court,  PRASA hawks most vigorously a  claim of\n\n                                8\n\nprocedural   error.      This  claim   spotlights   the   Board's\n\ninterpretation of  EPA's standard  for dispensing  (or dispensing\n\nwith) evidentiary hearings,  especially its  conclusion that  the\n\ntext  of  the applicable  regulation,  40  C.F.R.    124.75(a)(1)\n\n(stipulating that, to warrant  an evidentiary hearing and deflect\n\nadministrative  summary  judgment,   the  non-moving  party  must\n\nestablish the existence of  \"material issues of fact  relevant to\n\nthe  issuance of the permit\"),  should be read  as the functional\n\nequivalent of  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  56(c) (which  authorizes summary\n\njudgment if there  is \"no genuine issue as to any material fact,\"\n\nand  thereby  requires  the  non-moving party  to  establish  the\n\nexistence  of a  genuinely  disputed material  fact to  forestall\n\nsummary judgment).   Section  124.75, PRASA asserts,  contains no\n\n\"genuineness\" requirement,  and, moreover, even if  the Board had\n\nthe  authority  to  read  a \"genuineness\"  requirement  into  the\n\nregulation, it could not do so without giving advance notice.  We\n\nfind no merit in these assertions.\n\n         The Structure of Administrative Summary Judgment\n                                                         \n\n          In erecting an adjudicatory framework that included  an\n\nadministrative  summary  judgment   procedure,  EPA   necessarily\n\ncontemplated that, to qualify for an evidentiary hearing, a party\n\nwould have to present a genuine and  material dispute.  Those two\n\nrequirements are  inherent in the very  concept of administrative\n\nsummary  judgment.     Any   other  assumption  borders   on  the\n\nchimerical:  under  federal case  law, a \"material\"  fact is  one\n\nthat  may affect the outcome of the case, see Anderson v. Liberty\n                                                                 \n\n                                9\n\nLobby,  Inc.,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248  (1986);  United States  v.

To force an\n                                \n\nagency fully to adjudicate a  dispute that is patently frivolous,\n\nor that can  be resolved in  only one  way, or that  can have  no\n\nbearing  on the disposition of  the case, would  be mindless, and\n\nwould  suffocate the root purpose for  making available a summary\n\nprocedure.    Indeed, to  argue    as  does petitioner     that a\n\nspeculative  or purely theoretical  dispute    in other  words, a\n\nnon-genuine  dispute     can  derail summary  judgment  is  sheer\n\npersiflage.\n\n          We think that EPA's regulations lawfully can be read to\n\nincorporate   this  binary   test,   featuring  genuineness   and\n\nmateriality.   What  is  more,  we  refuse to  attach  talismanic\n\nsignificance to the absence of the stock phrase \"genuine issue of\n\nmaterial  fact.\"  The reference found in 40 C.F.R.   124.75(a)(1)\n\nto \"material\"  issues of  \"relevant\" fact achieves  precisely the\n\nsame  end.   In  practice, courts  and  agencies regularly  use a\n\nvariety of terms to describe the two pillars of summary judgment.\n\n                    \n\n     4While these definitions developed in the milieu of Rule 56,\nthey are by no means limited to that milieu.\n\n                                10\n\n          We  hasten   to  add  that,  despite   this  linguistic\n\nequivalency,  explicitly   drawing  a   connection  to   Rule  56\n\naccomplishes  three   things.    First,  it   provides  a  common\n\nvocabulary,  easily understandable  by  litigants,  lawyers,  and\n\nadjudicators.     Second,   it   introduces  into   an   agency's\n\njurisprudence  a  ready-made  ensemble of  decisional  precedents\n\nassociated with Rule 56,  see, e.g., Garside v. Osco  Drug, Inc.,\n                                                                \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536033\"><a href=\"/opinion/536033/milissa-garside-v-osco-drug-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 48  (1st Cir.  1990) (holding  that at  the summary\n\njudgment  stage the evidence must  be examined in  the light most\n\nfavorable to the nonmovant).

In support, PRASA posits three interrelated arguments:\n\n(1) that summary  judgment, as it  exists in  the courts, has  no\n\nlegitimate  place in  agency  practice;  (2) that  administrative\n\nsummary  judgment does not carry with it  the baggage of Rule 56;\n\nand (3) that, in  all events, EPA took an  impermissible shortcut\n\nand embraced a Rule  56 standard precipitously, without affording\n\n                                11\n\nfair notice or an  opportunity to respond.  These  arguments lack\n\nforce.\n\n         The Validity of Administrative Summary Judgment\n                                                        \n\n          The   choice  between   summary   judgment   and   full\n\nadjudication   in virtually any context   reflects a balancing of\n\nthe  value  of  efficiency against  the  values  of  accuracy and\n\nfairness.    Seen in  that  light, summary  judgment  often makes\n\nespecially  good sense in an administrative forum, for, given the\n\nvolume  of   matters  coursing  through  an   agency's  hallways,\n\nefficiency is perhaps  more central to an agency than to a court.\n\nSee Charles  C.

At the  same time, summary\n\njudgment  is less  jarring in  the administrative  context; after\n\nall,  even  under  optimal  conditions, agencies  do  not  afford\n\nparties  full-dress  jury  trials.   Taking  these  factors  into\n\naccount, it  is  unsurprising that  most  major agencies  in  the\n\nfederal system  have opted to  make available procedures  for the\n\nsummary  disposition  of adjudicatory  matters.

It  follows  that\n                    \n\nadministrative  summary  judgment,  properly  configured,  is  an\n\nacceptable procedural device.\n\n               Applicability of Rule 56 Precedents\n                                                  \n\n          Petitioner's   attempt  to   break  the   bond  between\n\nadministrative summary judgment and its courtroom  counterpart is\n\nsimilarly  unavailing.    From  its  inception,  the  concept  of\n\nadministrative summary judgment  has been linked  inextricably to\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56.   In all probability, it was  Professor Davis\n\nwho first forged this link.  He wrote:  \"Some agencies might well\n\ntake a leaf from the federal  rules of civil procedure and permit\n\nsummary  judgment  without evidence  when  no  issue  of fact  is\n\npresented.\"   1 Kenneth C.  Davis, Administrative Law  Treatise  \n                                                               \n\n8.13, at  578 (1958).   A  dozen years  later, two  other leading\n\nadministrative   law  scholars  seized  upon  this  sentence  and\n\ndeveloped it into a highly influential report to the Committee on\n\nAgency   Organization   and  Procedure   of   the  Administrative\n\nConference of the United  States.

In our opinion, Rule 56 is the\n\nprototype for administrative summary judgment procedures, and the\n\njurisprudence that has grown up around Rule 56 is, therefore, the\n\nmost  fertile source of  information about administrative summary\n\njudgment.   Thus,  \"[w]ith  minor individual  modifications,  the\n\n                                15\n\nsummary judgment  procedures should  be similar in  most agencies\n\n[to  those  under   Rule  56].\"     1  Charles   H.

We explain briefly.\n\n          Although the  Board never before has  made the equation\n\nbetween Rule 56 and EPA's summary judgment procedure so explicit,\n\nit traditionally  has equated its procedural  standard for denial\n\nof an evidentiary hearing anent an  NPDES permit with the Rule 56\n\nyardstick.

As  a factual  matter, the\n          discharge  of  additional pollutants  into an\n\n                                20\n\n          already polluted marine environment virtually\n          always  increases  or contributes  to adverse\n          impact;  it  is  extremely  difficult,  as  a\n          practical matter, to demonstrate that it does\n          not.\n\n44 Fed. Reg. 34,784, 34,806 (June 15, 1979).\n\n          EPA concluded  that PRASA had not  cleared this hurdle,\n\nand the Board concurred.  It noted that the  studies submitted by\n\npetitioner   principally  the USGS  report    addressed only  the\n\ncurrent  impacts  of the  facility's  emissions  relative to  the\n\ncurrent  impacts of all other  emissions, and did  not purport to\n\nmake  predictions regarding future impacts.  See Board Op. at 15-\n                                                \n\n16.  Accordingly, without defining  exactly what type of evidence\n\nmight  surmount  the (f)(3)  hurdle,  the  Board determined  that\n\npetitioner's  effort came up short.   If this determination holds\n\nwater,  then the  agency  had  a  right  summarily  to  deny  the\n\npetition.10\n\n          This  reasoning finds  a striking  parallel in  Hynson.\n                                                                \n\nThere  the  Court  agreed that  an  agency  was  not required  to\n\n\"provide a formal hearing  where it is apparent at  the threshold\n\n                    \n\n     10PRASA  makes a  rather convoluted threshold  argument that\nimplicates the order of the showings which must be made to secure\nmodification of secondary treatment  requirements.  In this case,\nwe  doubt  that the  order of  the  showings makes  the slightest\ndifference.  Moreover, there is absolutely no basis for believing\neither that the showings  must be made in a  particular sequence,\nor that separate hearings must be held for each showing.   Absent\na  contrary indication in the regulation itself   and none exists\nhere   we think  it is fair to assume  that a party must  satisfy\nevery element of  a provision  written in the  conjunctive.

This  fusillade misses the\n\nmark.      Though   an   absolutist   interpretation,   rendering\n\nmodifications of secondary  treatment requirements for  emissions\n\ninto stressed waters unobtainable,  might well be problematic, we\n\ndo not read the Board's opinion in that fashion.\n\n          In  considering   this  issue,  the  Board  refused  to\n\npresume,  absent scientific  evidence, that  a large  quantity of\n\nlightly treated sewage   estimated  as 850 tons per year    would\n\nhave  no impact on the  surrounding stressed waters  in the event\n\nthat  other stresses  abated.   See  Board Op.  at  15-16.   This\n                                   \n\n                    \n\n     11PRASA does  offhandedly suggest that its  studies make the\nrequisite  showing  indirectly.   Compliance  with (f)(1),  PRASA\n                              \nmuses, might in  some cases  provide a scientific  basis for  the\nprediction required by (f)(3).  While that may (or may not) be so\nin  theory, it  is certainly not  so on  the facts  of this case.\nHere, PRASA's showing of no current impacts was weak at best, see\n                                                                 \ninfra  note 12,  and cannot  support the  weight of  the proposed\n     \ninference.\n\n                                23\n\nneither  betokens  an  absolutist   mindset  nor  forecloses  the\n\npossibility that  the Board might  entertain a presumption  of no\n\nfuture  harm  if  presented  with  the  prospect  of more  modest\n\nemissions.     Nor  does   the  Board's  opinion   foreclose  the\n\npossibility  that it might find a scientific showing of no future\n\nimpacts  to be persuasive.   On the contrary,  after noting EPA's\n\n\"great reluctance\"  to sanction  emissions into stressed  waters,\n\nthe Board made a point of leaving the door ajar:\n\n          This  is not  to say  that there  is no  case\n          where discharges into  stressed waters  would\n          be   allowed.     Where,  for   example,  the\n          receiving waters are  stressed by  pollutants\n          other  than those  in the  proposed discharge\n          and  such pollutants  do  not  contribute  to\n          existing stresses,  a   301(h)  permit may be\n          appropriate.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 18 </span><pre class=\"inline\">&amp; n.22.\n   \n\n          To say more  would be to  paint the lily.   We conclude\n\nthat  EPA  did  not  promulgate an  absolutist  standard.    And,\n\nmoreover, we find  the Board's  rendition of the  evidence to  be\n\nfaithful  to the  record,  its reasoning  to  be sound,  and  its\n\nposition  to be  well-supported by  authority.   Consequently, we\n\nhold  that the  Board  acted  within  its  authority  in  denying\n\npetitioner an evidentiary  hearing and summarily terminating  the\n\nadministrative appeal on the ground that the studies submitted by\n\npetitioner failed to  make any attempt to  satisfy the strictures\n\nof 40 C.F.R.   125.61(f)(3).12\n\n                    \n\n     12The Board  gave an alternative reason  for upholding EPA's\nrefusal to convene an evidentiary hearing, ruling that petitioner\nfailed to show  that its discharge did not  currently \"contribute\nto,  increase,  or perpetuate  . .  .  stressed conditions.\"   40\n\n                                24\n\nVI.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We  need  go  no  further.    PRASA's  application  for\n\nmodification  and  its  concomitant  request for  an  evidentiary\n\nhearing were  fairly considered and appropriately  rejected.  For\n\nthe reasons set forth herein, we uphold the agency's final action\n\nand deny PRASA's petition for review.\n\nIt is so ordered.\n                \n\n                    \n\nC.F.R.   125.61(f)(1) (1993).  We need not pursue this point, for\npetitioner's  failure to  adduce hearing-worthy  evidence  on the\nfuture impacts prong is  in itself enough to justify  denying the\ninstant  petition  for  judicial  review.    We  add in  passing,\nhowever, that the record strongly suggests the correctness of the\nBoard's conclusion on the current impacts prong as well.\n\n                                25\n</pre>",
