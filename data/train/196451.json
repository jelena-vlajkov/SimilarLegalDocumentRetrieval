Background\r\n\n          On May 21, 1989, the plaintiffs' son, Corey, was killed\r\n\nwhen  the aircraft he was  flying, as a  pilot under instruction,\r\n\nwas struck  over the New Hampshire-Vermont border  by an aircraft\r\n\nfrom Florida.   Several months later, the  Sawtelles contacted an\r\n\nattorney in New  Hampshire to  discuss the filing  of a  wrongful\r\n\ndeath  suit on behalf of their son's  estate.  The local attorney\r\n\nreferred plaintiffs to the  California-based law firm of Speiser,\r\n\nKrause,  Madole   &amp;  Cook,  presumably  because   of  the  firm's\r\n\nreputation for expertise in aircraft litigation.2\r\n\n          In  March 1990,  an  attorney at  the California  firm,\r\n\nwhich is not a party to this litigation, sent duplicate originals\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   In an  affidavit dated January 20,  1995, Mr. Sawtelle stated\r\nthat plaintiffs  obtained the  name of  the California  firm when\r\nthey saw an advertisement  for that firm in a  magazine published\r\nby  the Aircraft  Owners  and Pilots  Association (\"AOPA\").   The\r\naffidavit is identical to an unsigned and undated draft affidavit\r\nof Mr. Sawtelle except that the draft states that plaintiffs were\r\nreferred to  the California firm  by the New  Hampshire attorney.\r\nIn defendants' counter-affidavit they deny ever having advertised\r\nin any AOPA publication and, in support of their contention, they\r\nsubmitted an  affidavit of an  advertising assistant at  AOPA who\r\nconfirms  that there were no  advertisements for the  law firm in\r\nthe AOPA magazine for the years 1988 through  1991.  The district\r\ncourt  discounted the  Sawtelles'  claim that  they retained  the\r\nCalifornia law firm on the basis of a magazine advertisement.  We\r\ndo not disturb that determination.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nof  a  retainer agreement,  which  had already  been  executed on\r\n\nbehalf  of the  firm, to  the Sawtelles  in New  Hampshire.   The\r\n\nretainer agreement included a provision granting the firm  a lien\r\n\nupon  any sum received in  the plaintiffs' cause  of action.  The\r\n\nSawtelles signed the agreement  and returned an executed original\r\n\nto  the California firm, which  then transferred the  case to its\r\n\nWashington, D.C. (now Rosslyn, Virginia) affiliate, the defendant\r\n\nSpeiser, Krause, Madole &amp; Lear (\"the Speiser firm\").\r\n\n          The case  was assigned to defendant,  George E. Farrell\r\n\n(\"Farrell\"), a Virginia resident and an attorney with the Speiser\r\n\nfirm.    Mr. Farrell  is  not  licensed to  practice  law  in New\r\n\nHampshire.  Although Farrell never personally met the plaintiffs,\r\n\nhe sent at  least fifteen  letters to them  in New Hampshire  and\r\n\nspoke to  them  by telephone  on  numerous occasions  during  the\r\n\nrepresentation.      Among   the  topics   addressed   in   those\r\n\ncommunications was Farrell's recommendation  that Florida was the\r\n\nmost advantageous forum for the wrongful death claim.\r\n\n          To assist as local  counsel in Florida, Farrell engaged\r\n\nthe Florida  law firm, defendant,  Podhurst, Orseck,  Josefsberg,\r\n\nEaton,  Meadow,  Olin  &amp;  Perwin,  P.A.  (\"the  Podhurst  firm\").\r\n\nDefendant  Michael S.  Olin  (\"Olin\"), a  Florida resident  and a\r\n\nmember of the Podhurst  firm, handled the Sawtelles' claims.   He\r\n\nis licensed to practice law in Florida, but not in New Hampshire.\r\n\nLike  Farrell, Olin  never personally  met the Sawtelles  but did\r\n\nsend numerous letters to  them in New Hampshire  and participated\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nin several telephone conversations with them concerning his legal\r\n\nrepresentation.\r\n\n          In  March 1991,  Attorney Olin  filed a  wrongful death\r\n\naction  on behalf of the Sawtelles in the Broward County Judicial\r\n\nCircuit  Court  in Florida.   The  complaint  for the  estate was\r\n\nsigned on behalf  of the Speiser firm and the  Podhurst firm.  In\r\n\nJuly  1991, negotiations  with the  defendants in  the underlying\r\n\nwrongful  death claim resulted in a settlement offer of $155,000.\r\n\nBy  letter dated August 7,  1991, and in  response to plaintiffs'\r\n\nconcerns regarding the  sufficiency of  the settlement,  Attorney\r\n\nFarrell told  the Sawtelles  that \"[he]  believe[ed] it  [was] in\r\n\n[their]  best interest  to  accept the  settlement.\"   Plaintiffs\r\n\nallege  that  Olin, too,  advised  them, by  telephone,  that the\r\n\nsettlement was in their best interest.   The Sawtelles ultimately\r\n\naccepted the settlement offer.\r\n\n          Olin later  became concerned about the  disbursement of\r\n\nsettlement funds  to Corey  Sawtelle's brother Jason,  who was  a\r\n\nminor  at the  time.   To  determine  his obligations  under  New\r\n\nHampshire law, Olin  contacted an attorney  in New Hampshire  for\r\n\nadvice regarding the distribution of  the funds.  Having obtained\r\n\nsuch advice, Attorney Olin finally disbursed the settlement funds\r\n\nin December 1991.\r\n\n          The Sawtelles subsequently learned  that: 1) the estate\r\n\nof Ronald Brown, Corey's  flight instructor who had also  died in\r\n\nthe  crash, had filed  a wrongful death  suit in  Florida; 2) the\r\n\naction had  been consolidated  with the case  brought by  Corey's\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nestate;  and 3)  the  instructor's  claim  had been  settled  for\r\n\n$500,000.   That  discovery prompted  the Sawtelles  to file  the\r\n\npresent legal malpractice  action against  defendants in  federal\r\n\ndistrict court in New Hampshire.\r\n\n          The  Sawtelles'  malpractice  claims  allege  that  the\r\n\ndefendants negligently negotiated an inadequate settlement of the\r\n\nwrongful  death claim of their  son's estate.   Among the alleged\r\n\nshortcomings in defendants' performance  were the failures: 1) to\r\n\ntake depositions; 2) to obtain an economist's projection of their\r\n\nson's lost earning capacity; and 3) to consult liability  experts\r\n\nor engage  in significant  investigative efforts.   The Sawtelles\r\n\nfurther  allege that  defendants negligently  directed settlement\r\n\nadvice  into New Hampshire (by  telephone and mail), causing them\r\n\nto  rely on that  advice and thereby suffer  economic loss in New\r\n\nHampshire.  \r\n\n          The defendants  moved to  dismiss for lack  of personal\r\n\njurisdiction.   The motion was  granted by the  district court on\r\n\nApril 28, 1995, and this appeal followed.\r\n\nIII.  Analysis\r          III.  Analysis\r\n\n          When a court's jurisdiction is contested, the plaintiff\r\n\nbears the burden of  proving that jurisdiction lies in  the forum\r\n\nstate.   McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 298 U.S. 178,\r                                                            \r\n\n189  (1936); Dalmau Rodr guez v.

In  determining  whether  a  non-resident\r\n\ndefendant  is  subject  to  its  jurisdiction,  a  federal  court\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nexercising diversity jurisdiction  \"is the functional  equivalent\r\n\nof  a state court sitting in the  forum state.\"  Ticketmaster, 26\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d  at 204;  see  also General  Contracting  &amp; Trading  Co.  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nInterpole, Inc. 940 F.2d 20, 23 n.4 (1st  Cir. 1991).   The court\r                         \r\n\nmust, therefore,  find sufficient contacts  between the defendant\r\n\nand the forum to  satisfy both that state's long-arm  statute and\r\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process clause.

In the case  at\r\nhand,  the  Sawtelles'  action  turns  on  a  theory of  specific\r\njurisdiction  (i.e., jurisdiction which a state may assert when a\r\nclaim arises directly out of forum-based activities. Id. at 462.\r                                                                  \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nAccordingly, we must consider the New Hampshire long-arm statutes\r\n\napplicable to each of these defendants.\r\n\n          The New Hampshire  long-arm statute  applicable to  the\r\n\nindividual defendants, Olin  and Farrell, is N.H.

Wetmore, 129 N.H. 520, 523 (1987),\r                                                \r\n\nthe Supreme Court of New  Hampshire interpreted the latter phrase\r\n\nto include situations  where a defendant's out-of-state  activity\r\n\nresults  in  an  injury  within New  Hampshire.    The  Sawtelles\r\n\nexhaustively  argue  that  their  claims  against  the individual\r\n\ndefendants  satisfy  each  of  the possible  bases  for  personal\r\n\njurisdiction.  Not surprisingly, defendants disagree.\r\n\n          We need not  dwell on  this issue.   The New  Hampshire\r\n\nlong-arm statute  applicable to individuals has  been interpreted\r\n\nto  afford  jurisdiction over  foreign  defendants  \"to the  full\r\n\nextent that the  statutory language and due  process will allow.\"\r\n\nPhelps v. Kingston,  130 N.H. 166, 171 (1987).   As recognized by\r                            \r\n\nthe court below,  when a state's long-arm  statute is coextensive\r\n\nwith  the outer  limits  of due  process,  the court's  attention\r\n\nproperly turns to the  issue of whether the exercise  of personal\r\n\njurisdiction comports with federal constitutional standards.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nHolt  Oil &amp;  Gas Corp.  v.

New  Hampshire's  long-arm\r\n\nstatute governing unregistered foreign corporations,  such as the\r\n\nPodhurst  professional association,  is  RSA  293-A:15.10  (Supp.\r\n\n1994).   That statute includes  no restriction upon  the scope of\r\n\njurisdiction  available  under  state  law  and  thus  authorizes\r\n\njurisdiction over such entities  to the full extent  permitted by\r\n\nthe federal Constitution.  See McClary v. Erie Engine &amp; Mfg. Co.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n856 F. Supp. 52, 55 (D.N.H. 1994)(because RSA 293-A:15.10 reaches\r\n\nto  the  federal limit,  the  traditional  two-part analysis  for\r\n\npersonal jurisdiction  \"collapses  into the  single  question  of\r\n\nwhether the constitutional requirements  of due process have been\r\n\nmet\").\r\n\n          The appropriate  treatment of the Speiser  firm is less\r\n\nclear.   The  New Hampshire  long-arm statutes  do not,  by their\r\n\nterms, apply to partnerships,  and the case law does  not discuss\r\n\nany long-arm provision  applicable to such entities.   To address\r\n\nthat  unresolved  issue of  state  law,  the Sawtelles  turn  for\r\n\nguidance to RSA 305-A:6-8 (Supp. 1994), which relates to  service\r\n\nof process on a foreign partnership.  Observing that service on a\r\n\nforeign partnership is treated nearly identically to service on a\r\n\nforeign corporation under RSA  293-A:15.10, plaintiffs argue that\r\n\npartnerships are  to be  treated as corporations  for determining\r\n\npersonal jurisdiction.  If that is so, then, as in the individual\r\n\nand corporate contexts discussed above, the scope of jurisdiction\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nover  the  Speiser firm  partnership  is  commensurate with  that\r\n\npermitted under the Constitution.\r\n\n          We find it unnecessary  to resolve this unsettled issue\r\n\nof   state  law   because  a   plaintiff  seeking   to  establish\r\n\njurisdiction over  a foreign  defendant must satisfy  the demands\r\n\nnot only of state law but also of the federal Constitution.  When\r\n\nconfronted with a similar  quandary in Ticketmaster, we  chose to\r                                                             \r\n\nbypass the statutory phase  of the jurisdictional inquiry because\r\n\nthe plaintiff's  case could not  pass constitutional muster.   26\r\n\nF.3d  at  206.   We therefore  assume,  arguendo, that  under New\r                                                          \r\n\nHampshire law the scope of personal jurisdiction over the Speiser\r\n\nfirm partnership is, as  in the case of the  corporate defendant,\r\n\ncoextensive with the outer limits of due process.\r\n\n                    B.

We therefore must  consider the contacts\r\n\nbetween the  defendants and  the forum  state viewed  through the\r\n\nprism of plaintiffs' legal malpractice claim.\r\n\n          Of the limited contacts  between the defendants and New\r\n\nHampshire during their legal  representation, few are relevant to\r\n\nthe  Sawtelles' claim  of legal  malpractice and thus  few assist\r\n\nthem in satisfying the  relatedness element of the jurisdictional\r\n\ninquiry.  For  the Virginia defendants, Attorney Farrell  and the\r\n\nSpeiser  firm, the relevant contact was the August 7, 1991 letter\r\n\nmailed  to  the plaintiffs  in  New Hampshire,  in  which Farrell\r\n\nstated that he believed it to be in the Sawtelles' best interests\r\n\nto  accept  the  $155,000  settlement  offer.    For the  Florida\r\n\ndefendants,  Attorney Olin  and the  Podhurst firm,  the relevant\r\n\ncontact  with   the  forum,   for  purposes  of   the  Sawtelles'\r\n\nmalpractice claim,  was Olin's telephone call to New Hampshire in\r\n\nwhich he concurred in the settlement recommendation.\r\n\n          The transmission of  information into New Hampshire  by\r\n\nway of telephone or mail is unquestionably a contact for purposes\r\n\nof our analysis.  See Burger  King Corp. v.  Rudzewicz, 471  U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\n462, 476 (1985).   It  would, however, be  illogical to  conclude\r\n\nthat  those isolated  recommendations  constituted the  negligent\r\n\nconduct that  caused the  Florida injury  and thus were  in-forum\r\n\nacts sufficient  to establish  specific personal  jurisdiction in\r\n\nNew  Hampshire.5  A review of all the allegedly negligent actions\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5   The  injury suffered  by  the Sawtelles  as a  result of  the\r\nalleged  negligent  activities--the loss  of  their  right to  an\r\nadequate  recovery on  the wrongful  death claim  which  had been\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nof the  defendants preceding  the injury indicates  numerous non-\r\n\nforum  decisions  reached  by  the  defendants  in  Virginia  and\r\n\nFlorida,  but not  in  New Hampshire.

In short, it  was the aggregate  of the defendants'\r\n\nallegedly negligent  acts and omissions which  caused the Florida\r\n\ninjury, and the out-of-forum  negligence was the effective cause.\r\n\nSee Ticketmaster,  26 F.3d at 207;   Pleasant St. I,  960 F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n1089  (noting how  causation  principles inform  the due  process\r\n\nanalysis).\r\n\n          In  its analysis  of  the relatedness  requirement, the\r\n\ndistrict  court  relied   upon  Kowalski  v.

Ultimately,\r\n\nhowever,  the  gravamen of  the  Sawtelles'  claim is  that  they\r\n\nsuffered  in  New  Hampshire  the \"effects\"  of  the  defendants'\r\n\nnegligence  committed elsewhere.  See Kowalski,  787 F.2d  at 11.\r                                                        \r\n\nThe communications sent into New Hampshire were ancillary  to the\r\n\nallegedly  negligent  non-forum  activities,  and  because  those\r\n\ncommunications were the only relevant contacts with the forum for\r\n\npurposes of  the Sawtelles'  malpractice claim, we  conclude that\r\n\nthe plaintiffs' showing of relatedness should be characterized as\r\n\ntenuous at best.  It hangs, as it were, by a thread.\r\n\n2.  Purposeful Availment.\r          2.  Purposeful Availment.\r\n\n          We  next consider whether defendants' contacts with New\r\n\nHampshire represent  a purposeful availment by  defendants of the\r\n\nprivilege  of conducting business in that State.  The function of\r\n\nthe purposeful  availment requirement is to  assure that personal\r\n\njurisdiction is  not premised solely upon  a defendant's \"random,\r\n\nisolated,  or  fortuitous\" contacts  with  the  forum state.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nKeeton  v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 774 (1984).

Savchuk, 444\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.  320, 329  (1980).   In Ticketmaster, 26  F.3d at  207, this\r                                                   \r\n\nCourt  observed that the  cornerstones upon which  the concept of\r\n\npurposeful availment rest are voluntariness and foreseeability.  \r\n\na.  Voluntariness\r          a.  Voluntariness\r\n\n          The Sawtelles contend  that the requisite voluntariness\r\n\nis   present   because  \"in   the   context   of  attorney-client\r\n\nrelationships the act of knowingly  agreeing to represent an out-\r\n\nof-state client is plainly sufficient.\"  Plaintiffs' Brief at 36.\r\n\nPlaintiffs aim to bolster their argument by pointing to their law\r\n\nfirms'  alleged  promotion  of  their  reputations  beyond  their\r\n\nrespective borders.  We consider these arguments in turn.\r\n\n          At the time  they agreed  to provide  legal advice  and\r\n\nrepresentation  to  the  plaintiffs,  the   defendants  knew  the\r\n\nSawtelles were residents of  New Hampshire.  Defendants' contacts\r\n\nwith New  Hampshire, however, were limited  to communicating with\r\n\nthe clients in their  home state.  The wrongful  death litigation\r\n\nwas prosecuted in Florida, while other legal services  were being\r\n\nrendered  in Florida and other  places outside New  Hampshire.  A\r\n\nreview of the totality of the defendants' contacts with the forum\r\n\nstate leaves us gravely doubtful that the defendants purposefully\r\n\navailed  themselves  of  the  benefits  and  protections  of  New\r\n\nHampshire law.\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n          The  Eighth  Circuit case  of  Austad Co.  v.  Pennie &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nEdmonds, 823 F.2d  223 (8th  Cir. 1987), is  instructive on  this\r                 \r\n\nrequirement for personal jurisdiction.  In Austad, a New York law\r                                                           \r\n\nfirm  represented  a South  Dakota  client  in patent  litigation\r\n\npending in Maryland.   The  contacts between the  firm and  South\r\n\nDakota during the  representation included numerous  phone calls,\r\n\nmailings,  and a three-day factfinding visit to South Dakota by a\r\n\nlawyer from the firm. See  id. at 224-25.  The client  later sued\r                                       \r\n\nthe  firm for  malpractice  in federal  district  court in  South\r\n\nDakota.  The  Court of Appeals held that the defendant law firm's\r\n\ncontacts  with  the  forum   were  insufficient  to  satisfy  the\r\n\n\"purposeful availment\" requirement, stating:\r\n\n          While  we do not dispute [the client's] claim\r\n          that an  attorney-client relationship existed\r\n          between [the parties], we do not believe that\r\n          [the firm] had sufficient contacts with South\r\n          Dakota to confer personal jurisdiction.\r\n\n823 F.2d  at 226.  The  Austad court thus deemed  the firm's only\r                                        \r\n\n\"substantial   connection\"   with   the  forum,   its   voluntary\r\n\nrepresentation  of  a  South  Dakota  corporation  in  litigation\r\n\noutside  of South Dakota, as insufficient to support a finding of\r\n\npurposeful availment.

The  enforcement of\r\n\npersonal   jurisdiction  over   a   non-resident   defendant   is\r\n\nforeseeable  when that  defendant  has  established a  continuing\r\n\nobligation  between itself and the forum state.  See Burger King,\r                                                                          \r\n\n471 U.S. at  476; Travelers  Health Ass'n v.

Among  the continuing obligations  between the\r\n\ndefendants and the forum  state relied upon by the  Sawtelles are\r\n\n1)  the involvement of New  Hampshire law in  the distribution of\r\n\nthe settlement proceeds, and 2) the contract by which the Speiser\r\n\nfirm  obtained a lien on any proceeds received in connection with\r\n\nthe plaintiffs' cause of action.\r\n\n          We  are underwhelmed  by the  force of  the plaintiffs'\r\n\nargument.   The requirements of New Hampshire law with respect to\r\n\nthe distribution of settlement proceeds procured from the Florida\r\n\nlitigation has no bearing upon the question of whether or not the\r\n\ndefendants  purposefully availed  themselves of  that law.   More\r\n\nimportantly, although  the plaintiffs required the  assistance of\r\n\nNew Hampshire counsel in  order to distribute settlement proceeds\r\n\nto their  minor son, the defendant law firms themselves performed\r\n\nno legal services in New Hampshire in that regard.\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\n          In support of their contention that the lien granted to\r\n\nthe Speiser firm by the retainer agreement constitutes purposeful\r\n\navailment of  the privileges and  benefits of New  Hampshire law,\r\n\nthe  Sawtelles rely upon Sher v.

See id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n1363.  Although neither the written and telephonic communications\r\n\nnor the  California visits sufficed, by  themselves, to establish\r\n\npurposeful availment,  the addition of the execution  of the deed\r\n\nof trust  signified a sufficient  invocation of the  benefits and\r\n\nprotections  of the laws of California to warrant the exercise of\r\n\njurisdiction.  See id.  at 1363-64.  The Court reasoned  that the\r                                \r\n\nsecurity    interest     \"contemplated    [significant]    future\r\n\nconsequences\" in the forum-state, i.e., perfecting an interest in\r\n\nreal   estate  would  require   recording  in  California,  while\r\n\nobtaining and enforcing a judgment on the deed would require both\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\nthe  application   of  the  forum's  law  and   court  action  in\r\n\nCalifornia.  Id. at 1363.\r                          \r\n\n          The Sher decision  is readily distinguishable from  the\r                            \r\n\ncase before  us, however.  While  the deed of trust  in Sher gave\r                                                                      \r\n\nthe  Florida partnership  a  security interest  in real  property\r\n\nlocated in California, the  lien granted to the Speiser  firm did\r\n\nnot  encumber or affect title  to any New  Hampshire real estate.\r\n\nThe  Speiser  lien was  a  transitory  obligation which  traveled\r\n\nwherever  the Sawtelles or the  holder of the  proceeds might go.\r\n\nEven  without a lien, a contractual obligation to pay the Speiser\r\n\nfirm's  fee  existed,  an  obligation  enforceable  wherever  the\r\n\nSawtelles  were  located.    Unlike  the  Sher  deed   of  trust,\r                                                        \r\n\ntherefore, the Speiser lien required no entanglement with the law\r\n\nof the forum state.\r\n\n          Consequently,  the frailty  of  plaintiffs' showing  at\r\n\nthis second stage of  the personal jurisdiction analysis  is even\r\n\nmore  pronounced  than   the  tenuous  showing  of   relatedness,\r\n\ndiscussed supra.  This \"thread\" is frayed and tattered.  The mere\r                         \r\n\nact of  agreeing to represent (and then  representing) an out-of-\r\n\nstate  client,  without more,  does  not  suffice to  demonstrate\r\n\nvoluntary purposeful availment of the benefits and protections of\r\n\nthe  laws of the client's  home state.   Furthermore, the alleged\r\n\ncontinuing obligation between the defendants and New Hampshire is\r\n\nvirtually non-existent.  Ultimately, the  weakness of plaintiffs'\r\n\narguments  with respect to the  first two stages  of the personal\r\n\njurisdiction analysis  provides  insufficient support  for  their\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\nappeal, even when stitched together with their argument as to the\r\n\nfinal stage, to which we now turn.\r\n\n3.  The Gestalt Factors.\r          3.  The Gestalt Factors.\r\n\n          A  court's  jurisdictional  inquiry  is  not  merely  a\r\n\n\"mechanical exercise,\" Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d at 208, and concepts\r                                             \r\n\nof reasonableness must illuminate the  minimum contacts analysis.\r\n\nSee  World-Wide  Volkswagen  Corp.,  444 U.S.  286,  292  (1980);\r                                            \r\n\nPleasant  St. I,  960 F.2d  at 1088  (\"[E]ven where  purposefully\r                         \r\n\ngenerated  contacts exist,  courts  must  consider  . .  .  other\r\n\nfactors which bear upon the fairness of subjecting [nonresidents]\r\n\nto the authority of a foreign tribunal\").  The Supreme Court  has\r\n\nidentified five such considerations,  which this Court has termed\r\n\nthe \"gestalt  factors\": (1) the defendant's  burden of appearing;\r\n\n(2) the forum state's  interest in adjudicating the dispute;  (3)\r\n\nthe plaintiff's  interest in  obtaining convenient  and effective\r\n\nrelief;  (4) the judicial system's interest in obtaining the most\r\n\neffective  resolution  of the  controversy;  and  (5) the  common\r\n\ninterests  of  all  sovereigns  in  promoting  substantive social\r\n\npolicies.   See Burger King, 471 U.S. at 477.  Although this part\r                                     \r\n\nof the jurisdictional analysis has parameters which are  not well\r\n\ndefined, we know  it serves  the purpose of  assisting courts  to\r\n\nachieve  substantial justice.   See Pritzker,  42 F.3d  at 63-64;\r                                                      \r\n\nTicketmaster, 26 F.3d at 209.\r                      \r\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\n          In   Ticketmaster,   this  Court   observed   that  the\r                                     \r\n\nreasonableness  stage of  the  jurisdictional  analysis evokes  a\r\n\nsliding scale:\r\n\n          [T]he weaker the  plaintiff's showings on the\r\n          first two prongs (relatedness  and purposeful\r\n          availment), the less a defendant need show in\r\n          terms    of   unreasonableness    to   defeat\r\n          jurisdiction.   The reverse  is equally true:\r\n          an     especially    strong     showing    of\r\n          reasonableness   may   serve  to   fortify  a\r\n          borderline   showing   of   relatedness   and\r\n          purposefulness.\r\n\n26 F.3d at 210.  Moreover, we note that a  failure to demonstrate\r\n\nthe necessary minimum contacts eliminates  the need even to reach\r\n\nthe issue of reasonableness:  \"[t]he [g]estalt factors  come into\r\n\nplay only  if the  first two  segments of  the test for  specific\r\n\njurisdiction have been fulfilled.\"   Pleasant St. I, 960  F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n1091 n.11.  We  proceed to consider the gestalt  factors, bearing\r\n\nin  mind  the  flimsy  showings  of  relatedness  and  purposeful\r\n\navailment made by the plaintiffs in this case.\r\n\na.  The Defendants' Burden of Appearance\r          a.  The Defendants' Burden of Appearance\r\n\n          The extent of the burden  on the defendants to litigate\r\n\nthe  malpractice action in New Hampshire  falls short of reaching\r\n\nconstitutional  significance.    For  Attorney  Farrell  and  the\r\n\nSpeiser  firm, the burden of defending in New Hampshire would not\r\n\nbe  substantively  different from  the  burden  of litigating  in\r\n\nFlorida.   Of course, the comparative burden on Attorney Olin and\r\n\nthe  Podhurst firm  of litigating  in  New Hampshire  rather than\r\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\ntheir  home state would be  greater.  In  Pritzker, however, this\r                                                            \r\n\nCourt recognized that defending  in a foreign jurisdiction almost\r\n\nalways  presents some  measure of  inconvenience, and  hence this\r\n\nfactor becomes meaningful  only where a  party can demonstrate  a\r\n\n\"special or unusual burden.\" 42 F.3d at 64.  When, as here, a law\r\n\nfirm  regularly represents  clients  outside its  home state,  we\r\n\nconclude that the burden is neither special nor unusual.\r\n\nb.  The Forum State's Adjudicatory Interest\r          b.  The Forum State's Adjudicatory Interest\r\n\n          This Court has recently observed that \"[t]he purpose of\r\n\n[this] inquiry is not to compare the  forum's interest to that of\r                                          \r\n\nsome other jurisdiction, but to determine the extent to which the\r\n\nforum  has an interest.\"  Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox\r                                                                           \r\n\nCanada, 46 F.3d 138, 151  (1st Cir. 1995)(emphasis in  original).\r                \r\n\nAlthough  it  is  true that  a  forum  state  has a  demonstrable\r\n\ninterest in  obtaining jurisdiction  over a defendant  who causes\r\n\ntortious  injury within its borders, see Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d at\r                                                               \r\n\n211,  New Hampshire  has a  far less  compelling interest  in the\r\n\nprosecution of  a legal malpractice suit stemming  from an injury\r\n\nthat  occurred outside of its borders.  Here, the acts comprising\r\n\nthe  defendants'  alleged  negligence  occurred  almost  entirely\r\n\noutside  of  New  Hampshire.   See  Donatelli,  893  F.2d at  472\r                                                       \r\n\n(\"[A]part  from a generalized concern  for the rights  of its own\r\n\ndomiciliaries,  the  [forum]  state   has  no  real  interest  in\r\n\nadjudicating the  controversy\").   This factor thus  cuts against\r\n\njurisdiction.\r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\nc.  The Plaintiffs' Interest in Obtaining Convenient Relief\r          c.  The Plaintiffs' Interest in Obtaining Convenient Relief\r\n\n          The  third  factor  to  consider   is  the  plaintiffs'\r\n\ninterest  in obtaining convenient and  effective relief.  We need\r\n\nnot dwell long  here.  This Court has repeatedly  observed that a\r\n\nplaintiff's  choice  of  forum  must  be  accorded  a  degree  of\r\n\ndeference  with respect to the issue of its own convenience. See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g., Foster-Miller, Inc., 46  F.3d at 151; Pritzker, 42  F.3d at\r                                                              \r\n\n64; Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d at 211.  Here, unquestionably, it would\r                          \r\n\nbe  more   convenient  for   the  Sawtelles  to   litigate  their\r\n\nmalpractice claim in their home state rather than elsewhere.\r\n\nd.  The Administration of Justice\r          d.  The Administration of Justice\r\n\n          We  next  evaluate  the judicial  system's  interest in\r\n\nobtaining  the  most  effective resolution  of  the  controversy.\r\n\nAlthough the Virginia defendants  contend that this consideration\r\n\nwould  best be satisfied by litigating the case in Florida, where\r\n\nsome of the defendants reside and where the wrongful death action\r\n\nwas pending, as in  our oft-cited earlier case, \"the  interest of\r\n\nthe judicial  system in  the effective administration  of justice\r\n\ndoes  not appear to cut in either direction\" here.  Ticketmaster,\r                                                                          \r\n\n26 F.3d at 211.\r\n\ne.  Pertinent Policy Arguments\r          e.  Pertinent Policy Arguments\r\n\n          This final \"gestalt\" factor requires us to consider the\r\n\ncommon  interests  of  all  sovereigns  in  promoting substantive\r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nsocial policies.   Here, the most prominent  policy implicated is\r\n\nthe ability  of a  state to  provide a  convenient forum for  its\r\n\nresidents to redress  injuries inflicted by out-of-forum  actors.\r\n\nSee  Burger King,  471 U.S.  at 473.   This policy  assumes added\r                          \r\n\nimportance in  our age of advanced  telecommunications, which has\r\n\nso  facilitated  the  representation  of  geographically  distant\r\n\nclients that it is not uncommon for a firm to  represent a client\r\n\nwithout meeting him or her in person or traveling to the client's\r\n\nstate of residence.  \r\n\n          Although  the concept  of  long-arm  jurisdiction  must\r\n\nadjust as  technological  advances render  blurry the  boundaries\r\n\nbetween the states, see World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at 308-09\r                                                       \r\n\n(Brennan, J., dissenting), we must heed the warning that \"it is a\r\n\nmistake  to assume that this trend heralds the eventual demise of\r\n\nall restrictions  on the personal jurisdiction  of state courts.\"\r\n\nPickens v. Hess, 573 F.2d 380, 387 (6th Cir. 1978)(quoting Hanson\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Denckla, 357 U.S. at 251).  To permit the exercise of personal\r                    \r\n\njurisdiction over the defendants in  this case would require this\r\n\nCourt to disregard that sage advice.\r\n\nIV.  Conclusion\r          IV.  Conclusion\r\n\n          In review, the Sawtelles  have demonstrated little more\r\n\nthan  a bare  minimum, if  that,  with respect  to the  first two\r\n\nstages  of the due process  inquiry.  The  plaintiffs' showing of\r\n\nrelatedness is weak because their claim for legal malpractice did\r\n\nnot  directly arise out of, nor was it related (in any meaningful\r\n\n                               -30-\r\r\n\nway)  to the law firms'  contacts with New  Hampshire.  Moreover,\r\n\nthe law  firms' telephone communications and  correspondence into\r\n\nthe forum did not represent a \"purposeful availment\" by the firms\r\n\nof  the  privilege  of  conducting  business  activities  in  New\r\n\nHampshire.    The  law  firms  did  not meaningfully  invoke  the\r\n\nbenefits and protections  of the  laws of New  Hampshire and  the\r\n\nhaling of such  defendants into  New Hampshire's  courts was  not\r\n\nforeseeable.\r\n\n          The frailty of plaintiffs'  showings on relatedness and\r\n\npurposeful  availment  is not  strengthened  as a  result  of our\r\n\nconsideration  of   the   reasonableness  of   an   exercise   of\r\n\njurisdiction  over  the  defendants  by a  New  Hampshire  court.\r\n\nAlthough the  exercise  of  jurisdiction may  be  proper  when  a\r\n\nborderline  showing of  relatedness and  purposeful  availment is\r\n\nsupported by  an especially solid showing  of reasonableness, see\r\n\nTicketmaster,  26  F.3d at  210,  our \"gestalt\"  analysis  in the\r                      \r\n\ninstant   case   fails   to   reveal  any   such   fortification.\r\n\nAccordingly, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED. \r                                                             AFFIRMED\r\n\n                               -31-\r\r\n",

Background\r          II.  Background\r\n\n          On May 21, 1989, the plaintiffs' son, Corey, was killed\r\n\nwhen  the aircraft he was  flying, as a  pilot under instruction,\r\n\nwas struck  over the New Hampshire-Vermont border  by an aircraft\r\n\nfrom Florida.   Several months later, the  Sawtelles contacted an\r\n\nattorney in New  Hampshire to  discuss the filing  of a  wrongful\r\n\ndeath  suit on behalf of their son's  estate.  The local attorney\r\n\nreferred plaintiffs to the  California-based law firm of Speiser,\r\n\nKrause,  Madole   &amp;  Cook,  presumably  because   of  the  firm's\r\n\nreputation for expertise in aircraft litigation.2\r\n\n          In  March 1990,  an  attorney at  the California  firm,\r\n\nwhich is not a party to this litigation, sent duplicate originals\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   In an  affidavit dated January 20,  1995, Mr. Sawtelle stated\r\nthat plaintiffs  obtained the  name of  the California  firm when\r\nthey saw an advertisement  for that firm in a  magazine published\r\nby  the Aircraft  Owners  and Pilots  Association (\"AOPA\").   The\r\naffidavit is identical to an unsigned and undated draft affidavit\r\nof Mr. Sawtelle except that the draft states that plaintiffs were\r\nreferred to  the California firm  by the New  Hampshire attorney.\r\nIn defendants' counter-affidavit they deny ever having advertised\r\nin any AOPA publication and, in support of their contention, they\r\nsubmitted an  affidavit of an  advertising assistant at  AOPA who\r\nconfirms  that there were no  advertisements for the  law firm in\r\nthe AOPA magazine for the years 1988 through  1991.  The district\r\ncourt  discounted the  Sawtelles'  claim that  they retained  the\r\nCalifornia law firm on the basis of a magazine advertisement.  We\r\ndo not disturb that determination.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nof  a  retainer agreement,  which  had already  been  executed on\r\n\nbehalf  of the  firm, to  the Sawtelles  in New  Hampshire.   The\r\n\nretainer agreement included a provision granting the firm  a lien\r\n\nupon  any sum received in  the plaintiffs' cause  of action.  The\r\n\nSawtelles signed the agreement  and returned an executed original\r\n\nto  the California firm, which  then transferred the  case to its\r\n\nWashington, D.C. (now Rosslyn, Virginia) affiliate, the defendant\r\n\nSpeiser, Krause, Madole &amp; Lear (\"the Speiser firm\").\r\n\n          The case  was assigned to defendant,  George E. Farrell\r\n\n(\"Farrell\"), a Virginia resident and an attorney with the Speiser\r\n\nfirm.    Mr. Farrell  is  not  licensed to  practice  law  in New\r\n\nHampshire.  Although Farrell never personally met the plaintiffs,\r\n\nhe sent at  least fifteen  letters to them  in New Hampshire  and\r\n\nspoke to  them  by telephone  on  numerous occasions  during  the\r\n\nrepresentation.      Among   the  topics   addressed   in   those\r\n\ncommunications was Farrell's recommendation  that Florida was the\r\n\nmost advantageous forum for the wrongful death claim.\r\n\n          To assist as local  counsel in Florida, Farrell engaged\r\n\nthe Florida  law firm, defendant,  Podhurst, Orseck,  Josefsberg,\r\n\nEaton,  Meadow,  Olin  &amp;  Perwin,  P.A.  (\"the  Podhurst  firm\").\r\n\nDefendant  Michael S.  Olin  (\"Olin\"), a  Florida resident  and a\r\n\nmember of the Podhurst  firm, handled the Sawtelles' claims.   He\r\n\nis licensed to practice law in Florida, but not in New Hampshire.\r\n\nLike  Farrell, Olin  never personally  met the Sawtelles  but did\r\n\nsend numerous letters to  them in New Hampshire  and participated\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nin several telephone conversations with them concerning his legal\r\n\nrepresentation.\r\n\n          In  March 1991,  Attorney Olin  filed a  wrongful death\r\n\naction  on behalf of the Sawtelles in the Broward County Judicial\r\n\nCircuit  Court  in Florida.   The  complaint  for the  estate was\r\n\nsigned on behalf  of the Speiser firm and the  Podhurst firm.  In\r\n\nJuly  1991, negotiations  with the  defendants in  the underlying\r\n\nwrongful  death claim resulted in a settlement offer of $155,000.\r\n\nBy  letter dated August 7,  1991, and in  response to plaintiffs'\r\n\nconcerns regarding the  sufficiency of  the settlement,  Attorney\r\n\nFarrell told  the Sawtelles  that \"[he]  believe[ed] it  [was] in\r\n\n[their]  best interest  to  accept the  settlement.\"   Plaintiffs\r\n\nallege  that  Olin, too,  advised  them, by  telephone,  that the\r\n\nsettlement was in their best interest.   The Sawtelles ultimately\r\n\naccepted the settlement offer.\r\n\n          Olin later  became concerned about the  disbursement of\r\n\nsettlement funds  to Corey  Sawtelle's brother Jason,  who was  a\r\n\nminor  at the  time.   To  determine  his obligations  under  New\r\n\nHampshire law, Olin  contacted an attorney  in New Hampshire  for\r\n\nadvice regarding the distribution of  the funds.  Having obtained\r\n\nsuch advice, Attorney Olin finally disbursed the settlement funds\r\n\nin December 1991.\r\n\n          The Sawtelles subsequently learned  that: 1) the estate\r\n\nof Ronald Brown, Corey's  flight instructor who had also  died in\r\n\nthe  crash, had filed  a wrongful death  suit in  Florida; 2) the\r\n\naction had  been consolidated  with the case  brought by  Corey's\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nestate;  and 3)  the  instructor's  claim  had been  settled  for\r\n\n$500,000.   That  discovery prompted  the Sawtelles  to file  the\r\n\npresent legal malpractice  action against  defendants in  federal\r\n\ndistrict court in New Hampshire.\r\n\n          The  Sawtelles'  malpractice  claims  allege  that  the\r\n\ndefendants negligently negotiated an inadequate settlement of the\r\n\nwrongful  death claim of their  son's estate.   Among the alleged\r\n\nshortcomings in defendants' performance  were the failures: 1) to\r\n\ntake depositions; 2) to obtain an economist's projection of their\r\n\nson's lost earning capacity; and 3) to consult liability  experts\r\n\nor engage  in significant  investigative efforts.   The Sawtelles\r\n\nfurther  allege that  defendants negligently  directed settlement\r\n\nadvice  into New Hampshire (by  telephone and mail), causing them\r\n\nto  rely on that  advice and thereby suffer  economic loss in New\r\n\nHampshire.  \r\n\n          The defendants  moved to  dismiss for lack  of personal\r\n\njurisdiction.   The motion was  granted by the  district court on\r\n\nApril 28, 1995, and this appeal followed.\r\n\nIII.  Analysis\r          III.

See\r                                                                           \r\n\nHolt  Oil &amp;  Gas Corp.  v.

New  Hampshire's  long-arm\r\n\nstatute governing unregistered foreign corporations,  such as the\r\n\nPodhurst  professional association,  is  RSA  293-A:15.10  (Supp.\r\n\n1994).   That statute includes  no restriction upon  the scope of\r\n\njurisdiction  available  under  state  law  and  thus  authorizes\r\n\njurisdiction over such entities  to the full extent  permitted by\r\n\nthe federal Constitution.  See McClary v. Erie Engine &amp; Mfg.

The  New Hampshire  long-arm statutes  do not,  by their\r\n\nterms, apply to partnerships,  and the case law does  not discuss\r\n\nany long-arm provision  applicable to such entities.   To address\r\n\nthat  unresolved  issue of  state  law,  the Sawtelles  turn  for\r\n\nguidance to RSA 305-A:6-8 (Supp. 1994), which relates to  service\r\n\nof process on a foreign partnership.  Observing that service on a\r\n\nforeign partnership is treated nearly identically to service on a\r\n\nforeign corporation under RSA  293-A:15.10, plaintiffs argue that\r\n\npartnerships are  to be  treated as corporations  for determining\r\n\npersonal jurisdiction.

In such cases, the\r\n\nSawtelles contend,  the exercise  of personal jurisdiction  would\r\n\nhave been improper  because the malpractice actions did not arise\r\n\nout of the contacts  between the attorneys and the  forum states.\r\n\nIn contrast,  the plaintiffs  argue that their  malpractice claim\r\n\nsatisfies  the relatedness  requirement  because  the  defendants\r\n\ndirected negligent settlement advice into New Hampshire,  thereby\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\ncausing plaintiffs harm  in New  Hampshire as a  result of  their\r\n\nreliance upon such advice.\r\n\n          We  are  not   convinced  that   the  plaintiffs   have\r\n\ndistinguished themselves from  the plaintiff in Kowalski.

We  proceed to consider the gestalt  factors, bearing\r\n\nin  mind  the  flimsy  showings  of  relatedness  and  purposeful\r\n\navailment made by the plaintiffs in this case.\r\n\na.  The Defendants' Burden of Appearance\r          a.  The Defendants' Burden of Appearance\r\n\n          The extent of the burden  on the defendants to litigate\r\n\nthe  malpractice action in New Hampshire  falls short of reaching\r\n\nconstitutional  significance.    For  Attorney  Farrell  and  the\r\n\nSpeiser  firm, the burden of defending in New Hampshire would not\r\n\nbe  substantively  different from  the  burden  of litigating  in\r\n\nFlorida.   Of course, the comparative burden on Attorney Olin and\r\n\nthe  Podhurst firm  of litigating  in  New Hampshire  rather than\r\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\ntheir  home state would be  greater.

When, as here, a law\r\n\nfirm  regularly represents  clients  outside its  home state,  we\r\n\nconclude that the burden is neither special nor unusual.\r\n\nb.

Conclusion\r\n\n          In review, the Sawtelles  have demonstrated little more\r\n\nthan  a bare  minimum, if  that,  with respect  to the  first two\r\n\nstages  of the due process  inquiry.  The  plaintiffs' showing of\r\n\nrelatedness is weak because their claim for legal malpractice did\r\n\nnot  directly arise out of, nor was it related (in any meaningful\r\n\n                               -30-\r\r\n\nway)  to the law firms'  contacts with New  Hampshire.

The  law  firms  did  not meaningfully  invoke  the\r\n\nbenefits and protections  of the  laws of New  Hampshire and  the\r\n\nhaling of such  defendants into  New Hampshire's  courts was  not\r\n\nforeseeable.\r\n\n          The frailty of plaintiffs'  showings on relatedness and\r\n\npurposeful  availment  is not  strengthened  as a  result  of our\r\n\nconsideration  of   the   reasonableness  of   an   exercise   of\r\n\njurisdiction  over  the  defendants  by a  New  Hampshire  court.\r\n\nAlthough the  exercise  of  jurisdiction may  be  proper  when  a\r\n\nborderline  showing of  relatedness and  purposeful  availment is\r\n\nsupported by  an especially solid showing  of reasonableness, see\r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672029\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ticketmaster,</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/672029/ticketmaster-new-york-inc-v-joseph-m-alioto/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at  <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  our \"gestalt\"  analysis  in the\r                      \r\n\ninstant   case   fails   to   reveal  any   such   fortification.\r\n\nAccordingly, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED. \r                                                             AFFIRMED\r\n\n                               -31-\r\r\n</pre>",
