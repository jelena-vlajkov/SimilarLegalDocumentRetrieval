Ramirez Lavandero on brief for appellant.\n                           \nGuillermo  Gil, United States Attorney,  Warren Vazquez, Assistant\n                                                       \nUnited States Attorney, and Jose A. Quiles-Espinosa, Senior Litigation\n                                               \nCounsel, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per   Curiam.    Defendant,  Eugenio  James  Perez,\n                      \n\npleaded guilty  to a  one-count indictment charging  him with\n\npossession  with  intent  to  distribute  approximately  five\n\nkilograms of  cocaine in violation of 21  U.S.C.   841(a)(1);\n\nthe  cocaine  actually  weighed  5.008  kilograms.    He  was\n\nsentenced to  ten years  imprisonment, the  statutory minimum\n\nset forth in    841(b)(1)(A)(ii); the court did not  impose a\n\nfine.  This appeal ensued.\n\n          While  the appeal  was pending,  defendant's court-\n\nappointed counsel filed a brief in  accordance with Anders v.\n                                                          \n\nCalifornia, 386 U.S. 738 (1967).  He requests that we dismiss\n          \n\nthe appeal as frivolous and allow him to withdraw.  Defendant\n\nhad  until May  2, 1994 to  file a supplemental  pro se brief\n\nwhich he has not done.\n\n          In the  Anders brief, counsel states  that upon his\n                        \n\nreview of the record there is no basis on which to attack the\n\nchange of plea or sentencing hearings --  both were conducted\n\nin compliance with the  applicable rules.  See Fed.  R. Crim.\n                                              \n\nP.  11 and 32.  Counsel then  refers to two issues that might\n\ndeserve consideration by this court:  (1) the trial court did\n\nnot consider  the argument, made at  sentencing, that because\n\ndefendant was a minor participant, there should have been  an\n\nadditional downward departure under U.S.S.G.    3B1.2(b); and\n\n(2) the  fact  that  the  amount of  cocaine  that  subjected\n\ndefendant to the ten-year  mandatory term of imprisonment set\n\nforth in   841(b)(1)(A)(ii) (5 kilograms  or more of cocaine)\n\nwas only .008 of a kilogram.\n\n          As for the  first issue, there is  no evidence that\n\nthe  court  ignored the  argument  except in  its  failure to\n\nspecifically mention it  when imposing the sentence.   In any\n\nevent,   counsel  and   defendant  only   offered  conclusory\n\nstatements that  defendant was a carrier.   Finally, assuming\n\nthat  the  cocaine   weighed  5.008  kilograms,  a   downward\n\ndeparture  would have  run  afoul of  the ten-year  statutory\n\nminimum.\n\n          The question  of the  amount of cocaine  involves a\n\nsignificant  change   in  the  sentencing  options  to  which\n\ndefendant  might have  been  subject.    If the  cocaine  had\n\nweighed less than 5 kilograms, the statutory minimum drops to\n                 \n\nfive  years.    See    841(b)(1)(B)(ii).    Defendant's  base\n                   \n\noffense level  then changes  from 32 to  30.  See  U.S.S.G.  \n                                                 \n\n2D1.1(c)(7) (at least 3.5 kilograms but less than 5 kilograms\n\nof cocaine;  level 30).   With the three-level  reduction for\n\nacceptance of responsibility ordered by the sentencing court,\n\ndefendant's BOL would have been 27.  Combined with a Criminal\n\nHistory Category of II, the guideline range would be 78 to 97\n\nmonths.  Thus, defendant's sentence might have been less than\n\n10 years.\n\n          Although  defendant's  trial  attorney retained  an\n\nexpert  to weigh  the cocaine,  he never  filed  the expert's\n\n                             -3-\n\nreport  (as ordered by the  district court) nor  did he raise\n\nthe issue at the sentencing hearing.  One possible reason for\n\nthis omission could be  that the expert, in fact,  found that\n\nthe cocaine weighed more than 5 kilograms.  We note only that\n\nbecause a challenge  to counsel's failure to  file the report\n\nor  mention the issue at sentencing  turns on matters outside\n\nof the record,  we would  not consider it  on direct  review.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Arango-Echeberry, 927 F.2d 35, 39\n                                            \n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (such a claim may be brought in a 28 U.S.C.  \n\n2255  motion).   We,  of course,  express  no opinion  on the\n\nmerits  of such  a  claim.    The  bottom  line  for  present\n\npurposes, however, is that there is absolutely nothing in the\n\nrecord to  support an argument that the  cocaine weighed less\n\nthan 5 kilograms.\n\n          The brief shows that counsel conducted the required\n\nreview and analysis of the case.  See Anders, 386 U.S. at 744\n                                            \n\n(counsel must  conscientiously examine the record  and file a\n\nbrief pointing to anything that conceivably could support the\n\nappeal).    Upon  our  own  examination   of  all  the  trial\n\nproceedings, we conclude that the appeal is indeed frivolous.\n\nAs  a  result, we  allow  counsel's  motion to  withdraw  and\n                        \n\nsummarily  affirm the  judgment of  the district  court under\n                 \n\nLocal Rule 27.1.\n\n                             -4-\n",
