At  the close\n\nof  CPC's evidence in  the jury trial  of the  case, the district\n\ncourt granted Northbrook's  motion, pursuant to  Fed. R. Civ.  P.\n\n50(a), for  judgment as  a matter  of law.

CPC  is  a  multinational  packaging  and  manufacturing\n\ncorporation headquartered  in New Jersey.   From July 1,  1979 to\n\nJuly  1, 1980,  Northbrook  served as  CPC's  first layer  excess\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n insurance carrier, with a $25 million umbrella liability policy.\n\n          In 1968, CPC  acquired the Puritan Aerosol  Company and\n\nrenamed  it  Peterson/Puritan.    Peterson/Puritan  manufactures,\n\namong other things, flea spray, hair spray, spot remover and oven\n\ncleaner.   Its manufacturing facility  is located in the  town of\n\nCumberland,  Rhode   Island,  on  a   seventeen-acre  site  (\"the\n\nPeterson-Puritan  site\") fronted  on  its  western  side  by  the\n\nBlackstone River.   In 1979, both Cumberland  and the neighboring\n\ntown  of  Lincoln  discovered  chemical  contamination  in  their\n\nmunicipal water supplies,  the Quinnville Wellfields.   The wells\n\nwere closed later that year.\n\n          In  1980,  the United  States  Environmental Protection\n\nAgency (\"EPA\") hired the environmental engineering firm Goldberg-\n\nZoino and  Associates to conduct  a hydrogeological study  of the\n\naquifer underlying the Blackstone  River (the \"GZA Report\").   In\n\n1982, based on the results of the GZA Report, the Town of Lincoln\n\nsued Peterson/Puritan for contamination  of the Quinnville Wells.\n\nThat  suit was settled in 1984 for  $780,000.  The settlement was\n\npaid  by Northwestern  National Insurance  Company (\"Northwestern\n\nNational\"),  CPC's primary insurance carrier, under a policy with\n\na coverage limit of $1 million.\n\n          In   1983,   EPA   placed   an   area   including   the\n\nPeterson/Puritan  site and  the aquifer  east  of the  Blackstone\n\nRiver    (designated  by  the  EPA as  \"OU-1\")  on  its  National\n\nPriorities  List.     In   1987,  following   several  years   of\n\nnegotiations, EPA  issued  an Administrative  Order  by  Consent,\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n pursuant   to    the   Comprehensive    Environmental   Response,\n\nCompensation and  Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"),  42 U.S.C.    9601 et\r                                                                           \n\nseq., which identified Peterson/Puritan  as the party responsible\r             \n\nfor numerous hazardous chemicals migrating  into the groundwater,\n\nand   ordered   Peterson/Puritan    to   investigate   additional\n\nresponsible parties and  further analyze site conditions.   Later\n\nthat year, Northwestern National informed CPC and Northbrook that\n\nthe  primary   insurance  policy  was  exhausted,  thus  bringing\n\nNorthbrook into the fold.1\n\n          In July of  1987, CPC filed suit  against Northbrook in\n\nNew  Jersey state court seeking a  declaration that Northbrook is\n\nobligated to  indemnify it  for environmental  cleanup costs  and\n\ndamages arising from the Town  of Lincoln settlement and the EPA-\n\nordered  cleanup.    On  the  basis  of  diversity  jurisdiction,\n\nNorthbrook removed the case  to the United States  District Court\n\nfor the District of New Jersey.  In 1989, the New Jersey district\n\ncourt granted Northbrook's motion to transfer venue to the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Rhode Island.\n\n          After   the  transfer,  CPC   filed  a  motion   for  a\n\ndeclaration  that the substantive law of  New Jersey governs this\n\nlitigation.  In an Opinion dated  June 21, 1990, the Rhode Island\n\ndistrict court concluded, first, that in ruling  upon the choice-\n\n                    \r                              \n\n1  In May of 1987, CPC agreed to sell Peterson/Puritan to Hi-Port\nIndustries,  Inc.,  a  Texas  corporation.    As  part   of  that\nagreement,  Peterson/Puritan assigned to CPC its rights to claims\nunder any  insurance policy for  expenses already paid by  CPC in\nconnection with  the environmental  contamination claims  against\nPeterson/Puritan.\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n of-law issue it must apply the law of the state which  would have\n\nbeen applied  had the change  of venue not occurred  and, second,\n\nthat a New Jersey  court would apply New Jersey law  to this case\n\nbecause, as the  home base of the  insured, CPC, it has  the most\n\nsignificant interest in the outcome of the case.

The district  court\n\nconcluded that CPC failed to sustain its burden of establishing a\n\ngenuine issue of fact  with respect to whether the  contamination\n\nof the aquifer was \"sudden and accidental,\" within the meaning of\n\nNew Jersey law,  and therefore held that the  pollution exclusion\n\napplied.   CPC Int'l,  Inc. v. Northbrook  Excess &amp;  Surplus Ins.\r                                                                           \n\nCo., 759 F. Supp. 966, 976 (D.R.I. 1991).\r             \n\n          CPC appealed  and, on March  24, 1992, we  reversed the\n\ndistrict court's  grant of  summary judgment  for Northbrook  and\n\nremanded the case  to the district court.  We  concluded that, in\n\npredicting how the New Jersey  Supreme Court would interpret  the\n\n\"sudden  and  accidental\"  provision,  the  district  court  gave\n\ninsufficient  weight  to  decisions of  the  New  Jersey Superior\n\nCourt's Appellate  Division (New Jersey's  intermediate appellate\n\ncourt),  which had  concluded that  the  \"sudden and  accidental\"\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n provision  is ambiguous  and  had  interpreted  it  favorably  to\n\ninsureds as  providing coverage for  gradual pollution.   See CPC\r                                                                           \n\nInt'l, Inc. v.  Northbrook Excess and Surplus Ins.  Co., 962 F.2d\r                                                                 \n\n77, 97-98, reh'g denied, 962 F.2d 98 (1st Cir. 1992).2\r                                 \n\n          After  the  case  was  remanded,  Northbrook moved  for\n\nreconsideration  of  the  district   court's  1990  choice-of-law\n\ndecision.  In a Memorandum and Order dated December 16, 1993 (the\n\n\"Second Choice-of-Law  Decision\"),  the  district  court  granted\n\nNorthbrook's  motion, holding that  the substantive law  of Rhode\n\nIsland  would  henceforth  govern  the case.    We  denied  CPC's\n\npetition for mandamus.\n\n          The  case went  to trial  on  January 28,  1994.   Over\n\neleven  days,  CPC  offered  testimony  from  several  witnesses,\n\nincluding  three   experts,   and   employees   of   the   former\n\nPeterson/Puritan  facility.    At the  close  of  CPC's evidence,\n\nNorthbrook moved for  judgment as a matter  of law under Fed.  R.\n\nCiv.  P.  50(a).    On  February 16,  1994,  the  district  court\n\ndelivered a detailed oral opinion concluding that CPC had  failed\n\nto present evidence  from which a reasonable  jury could conclude\n\nthat there was an \"occurrence\"  -- an event resulting in property\n\ndamage -- during the policy period.  The district court therefore\r                                            \n\ngranted Northbrook's  motion  for judgment  as a  matter of  law.\n                    \r                              \n\n2  Because the New Jersey Supreme Court had never interpreted the\n\"sudden and accidental\" provision, and New Jersey does not have a\nprocedure  for  certification of  questions,  the district  court\nbased  its decision on  its interpretation of  decisions from New\nJersey's  trial and appellate  courts, and general  principles of\ncontract  interpretation  gleaned  from a  review  of  New Jersey\nSupreme Court cases.

With respect  to the  district\n\ncourt's  grant of judgment  as a matter  of law, we  note, at the\n\noutset, that judgment as a matter  of law is proper at the  close\n\nof the plaintiffs' case only when, after scrutinizing plaintiffs'\n\nevidence and the  inferences reasonably to be  drawn therefrom in\n\nthe  light most  favorable  to the  plaintiffs,  the trial  court\n\nconcludes that no reasonable jury could find in plaintiffs' favor\n\non   any  permissible  claim   or  theory.

Choice of Law\r                    A.  Choice of Law\r                                     \n\n          CPC asserts that  the district court erred  in changing\n\nits  original choice-of-law determination.  CPC makes two related\n\narguments in support of this assertion.  First, CPC contends that\n\nthe district  court violated  the \"law of  the case\"  doctrine in\n\nchanging  its  original   choice-of-law  ruling.    Second,   CPC\n\nmaintains  that the district  court's second choice-of-law ruling\n\nwas erroneous  -- i.e., that a  New Jersey court would  not apply\n\nthe substantive law of Rhode Island to this case.\n\n          In its  original choice-of-law  decision, the  district\n\ncourt ruled that  a New Jersey court would  apply the substantive\n\nlaw of New Jersey to the facts of this case.  The court concluded\n\nthat, under New Jersey's choice-of-law rules, New Jersey, as  the\n\nlocation  of  the insured,  has  the  strongest interest  in  the\n\noutcome of the case.  The court rejected  Northbrook's contention\n\nthat  the  substantive law  of  Rhode  Island,  the site  of  the\n\ncontamination, or, in the alternative,  the law of Illinois,  the\n\nstate  in which  the  insurer accepted  the  risk, should  apply.\n\n                    \r                              \n\n3   CPC also maintains that the  district court erred in deciding\nthe case on \"general  principles of law,\" rather than  the law of\nNew Jersey or  Rhode Island.  We address this contention with our\ndiscussion of the merits of the case.\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n Northbrook  sought,  unsuccessfully,  to have  the  choice-of-law\n\nquestion certified  to  this  court.   The  district  court  then\n\ngranted Northbrook's motion for summary judgment under New Jersey\n\nlaw.\n\n          In reversing  the  district  court's  summary  judgment\n\nruling, we noted that the  district court's June 21, 1990 choice-\n\nof-law decision that New Jersey law governs was not questioned on\n\nappeal and that,  therefore, it \"is law of the case.\"  CPC Int'l,\r                                                                          \n\n962 F.2d at 91.   We rejected Northbrook's petition for rehearing\n\non  the choice-of-law issue,  concluding that Northbrook  did not\n\npreserve  the issue  on appeal.    After the  case was  remanded,\n\nNorthbrook  filed a  motion requesting  that  the district  court\n\nreconsider its previous choice-of-law ruling.\n\n          In its  Second  Choice-of-Law  Decision,  the  district\n\ncourt  made  two  related rulings.    First,  the district  court\n\ndecided  that the New  Jersey Supreme Court's  recent decision in\n\nGilbert  Spruance   Co.  v.  Pennsylvania   Manufacturers'  Ass'n\r                                                                           \n\nInsurance Co., 629 A.2d 885  (N.J. 1993), represents \"a clear and\r                       \n\ncontrary  change  in  the  law   applicable  to  the  case\"  and,\n\ntherefore, that  \"the law of  the case presumption  is overcome.\"\n\nSecond,  the court  held that  a New  Jersey court,  applying the\n\nnewly articulated principles of Gilbert Spruance, would apply the\r                                                          \n\nsubstantive law  of Rhode Island to  the facts of  this case and,\n\ntherefore, that Rhode  Island law,  rather than  New Jersey  law,\n\nwould govern this litigation.\n\n          As noted  previously,  under  normal  circumstances  we\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n review de novo  a district court's choice of  the substantive law\r                        \n\nto  apply in  a  particular  case.   In  this  case, however,  an\n\nadditional  consideration  guides  our  review  of  the  district\n\ncourt's  choice-of law  decision.   Under the  \"law of  the case\"\n\ndoctrine, a decision by an appellate court on a particular issue,\n\nunless  vacated  or  set  aside,  governs the  issue  during  all\n\nsubsequent  stages of the  litigation.

The District Court Decision\r                                                     \n\n          In  ruling upon Northbrook's  motion for judgment  as a\n\nmatter of  law, the district  court made the  following pertinent\n\nfindings   of   fact.     Between  1963   and  the   late  1970s,\n\nPeterson/Puritan  polluted the  environment in  the  area of  its\n\nplant in Cumberland,  Rhode Island.   Peterson/Puritan  employees\n\nroutinely dumped chemicals, including  volatile organic compounds\n\n(\"VOCs\"), into the drain and septic systems.  In 1974, a railroad\n\ntank container at Peterson/Puritan spilled causing  approximately\n\n6,200 gallons of  the solvent perchloroethylene to spill onto and\n\ninto the soil (the \"1974 PERC spill\").\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n           The  theory of  the  case presented  by  CPC at  trial,\n\nprimarily through the testimony of two expert witnesses, was that\n\nprior   to   the  1974   PERC   spill,  the   VOCs   dumped  from\n\nPeterson/Puritan were in the soil but, because of the presence of\n\nsilt and clay, had not reached groundwater.  In other words, they\n\nwere stagnant.   Dr. Tod Delaney  testified that  the PERC  spill\n\nmobilized  these  VOCs  in  the   soil  and  led  them  into  the\n\ngroundwater  and, eventually,  the  combined  force  travelled  a\n\nseveral thousand foot path to  the Quinnville Wells.  Dr. Delaney\n\ntestified that,  but for  the 1974 PERC  spill, there  would have\n\nbeen  no pollution  of the  Quinnville Wells.   Dr.  Delaney also\n\ntestified that  the leading edge  of the 1974 PERC  spill reached\n\nand contaminated the Quinnville Wells in 1979,  during the policy\n\nperiod.  Pollution of the Quinnville Wellfields was discovered in\n\nOctober 1979, during the policy period.\n\n          In its  detailed oral  opinion granting  judgment as  a\n\nmatter of law  for Northbrook, the district  court reasoned that,\n\nbecause the policy was  only in effect from July 1,  1979 to July\n\n1,  1980, the burden  at trial was  upon CPC  to present evidence\n\nfrom  which a  reasonable  jury  could infer  that  there was  an\n\n\"occurrence\" during that period.\n\n          The  district court stated  that CPC's theory  at trial\n\nwas that because the EPA  desires to reopen the Quinnville Wells,\n\nand cleaning  the aquifer is  directly related to that  goal, the\n\n\"occurrence\" for purposes of insurance should be measured by when\n\nthe contamination  of the  wells occurred.   The  difficulty with\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\n this theory, as the district court explained, is that the Town of\n\nLincoln's  claim   against  Peterson/Puritan  to  clean   up  the\n\nQuinnville Wells had been settled  in 1984 and Northwood had paid\n\nthe  settlement under its  insurance policy.   The present action\n\nconcerns the  EPA's claims against CPC regarding the aquifer east\n\nof the Blackstone River -- the area designated by the EPA as OU-1\n\n-- not the Quinnville Wells.\n\n          The  district court  stated  that  whatever  the  EPA's\n\nmotivations concerning  reactivating the Quinnville Wells  in the\n\nfuture  may be, \"the  fact of the  matter is that  the area being\n\nremediated  is east  of the  Blackstone River.\"   The  court then\n\nconcluded that the  \"occurrence\" in this  case took place  before\n\nthe policy became effective.\n\n            The plaintiff seeks to recover the  costs\n            of remediation of the aquifer east of the\n            Blackstone  River  from  this  defendant.\n            The  evidence is clear  in this case from\n            the experts  presented by  the plaintiff,\n            that the aquifer  was damaged within  the\r                                                               \n            meaning  of   the  policy  when   it  was\r                                                               \n            polluted by the PERC spill in 1974 within\r                                                               \n            days or at  best, weeks of June  21, 1974\r                                                               \n            when  this PERC  spill  took place,  five\r                                                        \n            years  or more before  July 1,  1979 when\n            this policy took effect.\n\n          Because  it  found  that the  \"occurrence\"  took  place\n\nbefore the policy came into  effect, the district court concluded\n\nthat,  as  a matter  of  law,  Northbrook  was not  obligated  to\n\nindemnify CPC.  The district court explained that:\n\n            If  there is a principle of insurance law\n            that means  anything it is  the principle\n            that  insurance  protects  a policyholder\n            against future contingent events.  It  is\n            not   for   the  purpose   of   providing\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\n             compensation for events that have already\n            taken place, and that is so under the law\n            of New  Jersey, Rhode  Island, the  First\n            Circuit, or any other jurisdiction within\n            the United  States.   So, simply  on that\n            ground alone, the occurrence in this case\n            clearly  took  place  before  the  policy\n            became   effective,  there   can  be   no\n            recovery  of the  remediation costs  from\n            this insurance carrier.\n\n          The district court also rejected CPC's case for another\n\nreason.     The  court,  accepting  arguendo  CPC's  theory  that\r                                                      \n\nremediation  of  the  aquifer  is  tied  in  with  reopening  the\n\nQuinnville Wells,  concluded that CPC  had failed to  sustain its\n\nburden of showing that damage  to the Quinnville Wells took place\n\nduring the  policy period.   Dr. Willard  Murray testified  that,\n\ndepending upon the undetermined porosity of the soil, the leading\n\nedge  of  the PERC  plume  reached the  Quinnville  Wells between\n\nOctober  or November  1978, and  December 1981.   Reviewing  that\n\ntestimony, the district court noted  that it is \"just as probable\n\nthat that army of VOC's led by the PERC arrived at the Quinnville\n\nWells in 1978  or early 1979 as it is that  it arrived after July\n\n1, 1979.\"  The district court therefore concluded that \"[n]o jury\n\ncould find that  this pollution plume  arrived at the  Quinnville\n\nWells after July 1, 1979 without completely speculating.\"\n\n          The  district court held that there is \"no possibility\"\n\nthat  CPC  could  recover  from  Northbrook  for  the  costs   of\n\nremediation of the OU-1 area and, therefore, granted Northbrook's\n\nmotion.   In conclusion,  the court stated  that \"[t]his  case is\n\nbeing decided on general principles  of law and it really doesn't\n\nmatter whose law applies in this case.\"\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\n           By declining  to look  specifically to the  controlling\n\nlaw in  this case, the  law of  Rhode Island, the  district court\n\nessentially held that, under general principles of insurance law,\n\nthere  is one  trigger  date  for calculating  the  time when  an\n\n\"occurrence\"  causing \"property damage\" takes place; or, at least\n\nthat, if there is more than one possible trigger date, CPC  could\n\nnot recover under any of them.  In fact, there are at least seven\n\ntrigger dates utilized by different jurisdictions for determining\n\nthe  time at  which an occurrence  causing property  damage takes\n\nplace.6    Moreover,  as  discussed  below,  CPC  could  possibly\n\nrecover  under one  or  more of  these  theories.   Thus,  it  is\n\ncritical  to determine  which trigger  theory  of coverage  Rhode\n\nIsland would apply to this case.\n\n          As  noted, there  are at  least seven theories  used in\n\ndifferent jurisdictions for determining when an occurrence policy\n\nprovision is triggered.

Insurance  Co. of  North\r                                                                           \n\nAmerica,  667 F.2d 1034, 1047  (D.C.Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455\r                                                                      \n\nU.S. 1007, 102 S. Ct. 1644, 71 L.Ed.2d 875 (1982).\n\n          The  question of  which  trigger  theory  to  apply  is\n\ncritical in this case.  If  the Rhode Island Supreme Court  would\n\napply the wrongful act, exposure, or injury-in-fact theories, the\n\ndistrict  court's decision  should  be affirmed.    If the  Rhode\n\nIsland  Supreme  Court  would  apply   the  manifestation,  first\n\ndiscovery,  or \"reasonably knew  or should have  known\" theories,\n\nthe case  should be  remanded to  the  district court  for a  new\n\ntrial.  The  reason for this is  that, based on the  testimony at\n\ntrial,  a reasonable  jury could  have found  that the  1974 PERC\n\nspill caused the VOCs to migrate to the Quinnville Wells and that\n\nthe  PERC-led  contaminants  reached  the  wells  before  October\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\n 1979.8  Under  the manifestation theory, a  reasonable jury would\n\nbe entitled  to infer,  based on  CPC's uncontroverted  evidence,\n\nthat  the  first time  CPC  should have  known  of damage  to the\n\naquifer  was  in  October  1979, when  the  contamination  of the\n\nQuinnville  Wells was  discovered.9   It  follows  that the  same\n\nholds  true for  the first  discovery  and \"knew  or should  have\n\nknown\" theories.\n\n          The  district court was obligated to determine which of\n\nthese trigger-of-coverage theories the Rhode Island Supreme Court\n\nwould apply in this case.  Because it did not, we have endeavored\n\nto do  so here.   In  the end,  however, we  conclude that  Rhode\n\nIsland law  is unclear as  to which trigger-of-coverage is  to be\n\napplied  and, therefore, choose  to certify  the question  to the\n\nRhode Island Supreme Court.  \n\n          CPC argues  that Bartholomew,  a case  from the  United\r                                                \n\n                    \r                              \n\n8   The  particular  testimony  that would  support  this is:  1)\nDr. Delaney's  testimony, that,  but  for  the  PERC  spill,  the\nQuinnville wells  would not have been polluted;  2) the testimony\nthat  the pollution  was  discovered  in  October  1979;  and  3)\nDr. Murray's testimony  that the leading  edge of the  PERC plume\nreached  the Quinnville Wells  between October or  November 1978,\nand December 1981.  If the jury accepted all these facts as true,\nwhich we must  do on appeal, it could determine that the PERC-led\npollutants, stimulated by  the 1974 PERC spill, reached the wells\nbefore October 1979.\n\n9   The  district court  did  not make  specific  findings as  to\nwhether CPC  (or Peterson/Puritan)  reasonably should  have known\nthat the 1974  Perc spill would damage  the environment, although\nthe court  did note that  \"the event  was well recognized  by the\nmanagement of Peterson/Puritan.\"   The district court  also noted\nthat  it is  \"unfortunate that  people  were not  environmentally\ntuned in at  that time because, of course, Peterson/Puritan could\nhave made a substantial claim  against [the railroad carrier] for\npolluting the environment.\"\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\n States District Court for Rhode Island, purporting to apply Rhode\n\nIsland   law,  is   the  controlling   Rhode  Island   precedent.\n\nBartholomew holds  that the  date of the  occurrence is  the date\r                     \n\nwhen  the insured  \"knew or  should have  known\" of  the property\n\ndamage.10   Northbrook, on  the other  hand,  maintains that  the\n\nRhode Island Supreme Court's recent decision  in Textron, Inc. v.\r                                                                        \n\nLiberty Mut. Ins. Co., 639  A.2d 1358 (R.I. 1994), indicates that\r                               \n\nRhode Island  follows the  \"injury-in-fact\" theory  -- i.e.,  the\n\ndate  of an  occurrence  is  the date  when  the property  damage\n\noccurs.  We  agree that Bartholomew and Textron are  the most apt\r                                                         \n\ncases from  Rhode Island on  the trigger-of-coverage issue.   Our\n\nanalysis of  the two cases,  however, leads us to  the conclusion\n\nthat they raise more questions than they answer.\n\n          The district  court in  Bartholomew,  finding no  Rhode\r                                                       \n\nIsland  law  on  the subject,  predicted  that  the Rhode  Island\n\nSupreme Court  would adopt  the \"reasonably knew  or should  have\n\nknown\"   trigger-of-coverage  standard.      There  are   several\n\ndifficulties with this case as  an indicator of Rhode Island law.\n\nFirst,  our research  indicates that  no Rhode  Island court  has\n\neither explicitly  adopted or rejected  the Bartholomew standard;\r                                                                 \n\nin fact,  to our knowledge, no  Rhode Island court has  ever even\n\n                    \r                              \n\n10    CPC  actually  maintains  that  Bartholomew  establishes  a\r                                                           \n\"manifestation\"   trigger  of  coverage  --  i.e.,  there  is  no\n\"occurrence\" under the policy until the \"property damage\" becomes\nknown.   Bartholomew,  however,  clearly holds  that the  date of\r                              \noccurrence  is the  date when  the  insured \"knew,  or reasonably\r                                                                           \nshould  have   known,\"  of   the  injury   or  property   damage.\r                              \nBartholomew, 502 F.

Northbrook maintains that this statement indicates\n\nthat  Rhode Island looks  to the  point when  the injury  in fact\n\noccurs  as the trigger date for coverage.  Although we agree that\n\nit could  be read that  way, we  have several concerns  about the\r                  \n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\n reliability of  this general  statement as  a predictor  of Rhode\n\nIsland law in this case.\n\n          First,  the statement in Textron is entirely dictum; it\r                                                    \n\nappears only in a very general fashion and in a footnote;  and it\n\nwas not relevant to decision of the case.  In Textron, an insured\r                                                               \n\nsought  indemnification  for  property   damage  which  allegedly\n\noccurred  during the coverage  period but which  was not reported\n\nuntil twenty-one years  after the last policy's  expiration.  The\n\ncase  was disposed  of, in  favor of the  insurer, pursuant  to a\n\npolicy  provision  which  required that  the  insured  report the\n\nproperty damage within one year  of the expiration of the policy.\n\nTextron, 639 A.2d at 1363.  Thus,  the outcome of the case in  no\r                 \n\nway depended upon the langauge in the footnote.\n\n          Second, Textron  does  not  cite  Bartholomew,  a  case\r                                                                 \n\npurportedly applying Rhode Island law, which is cited extensively\n\nby courts in the First Circuit and other jurisdictions, and which\n\nadopts  an entirely  different standard.   We  think this  raises\n\nquestions  as to  exactly how  broad  a sweep  the Textron  court\r                                                                    \n\nintended its statement to have.\n\n          Third, the  phrase  \"injury-causing  event\"  could  (we\n\nthink reasonably)  be interpreted  as either  of three  potential\n\ntrigger theories.  It could  mean Rhode Island uses the \"wrongful\n\nact theory\"  in its trigger  of coverage analysis, which  in this\n\ncase would be the 1974 PERC spill.   It could mean, as Northbrook\n\nargues,  that  Rhode Island  follows  the  injury-in-fact theory.\n\nHere, according to CPC's own expert witnesses, the injury in fact\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\n would have occurred within days of the 1974 PERC spill.  Finally,\n\nit could refer  to the exposure theory.  In this case, that would\n\nhave been  when the VOCs  leeched into the environment  -- within\n\nminutes of the  1974 PERC spill.11  Moreover,  as the Bartholomew\r                                                                           \n\ncourt noted, the wrongful act theory, which  we think is the most\n\nliteral  reading of \"injury-causing event,\" \"has been rejected by\n\nthe vast majority  of jurisdictions.\"  Bartholomew, 502  F. Supp.\r                                                            \n\nat 253 (citing Annotation, 57 A.L.R.2d 1358 (1958)).12\n\n          For the reasons stated above,  we think that the law of\n\nRhode Island is \"unclear\" with respect to the trigger-of-coverage\n\nissue.  See  Lehman Brothers v. Schein,  416 U.S. 386, 94  S. Ct.\r                                                \n\n1741, 40  L.Ed.2d 215 (1974).  We also think that the trigger-of-\n\ncoverage  issue is determinative  of this  appeal.   We therefore\n\nconclude that the most appropriate  way to resolve the trigger of\n\ncoverage  issue,  consistent both  with our  duty to  apply Rhode\n\nIsland law  and with  important principles of  federalism, is  to\n\ncertify the question  to the Rhode Island  Supreme Court pursuant\n\nto Rule 6 of  the Rhode Island Supreme  Court Rules of  Appellate\n                    \r                              \n\n11  Judgment as a matter of law for Northbrook would be justified\nunder all three of these  theories because, based on the evidence\nadduced by  CPC  at  trial,  the  pertinent  events  under  these\ntheories of coverage did not take place during the policy period.\nThe  significance  of  the  fact  that  the  statement  could  be\ninterpreted  as   adopting  any  of  three  different  standards,\nhowever,  lies  not  in  the  substance  of  the  three potential\nstandards, per se,  but in the way it  reflects the indeterminate\r                           \nnature of the statement itself.\n\n12  Rhode Island is, of course, entitled to adopt a minority rule\nand,  provided it  does not  contravene  federal law,  which this\nclearly would not,  we would be bound  to apply it in  this case.\nHowever, given the other considerations listed above, we think it\nis appropriate to take this factor into account.\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\n Procedure.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the district court's choice-\n\nof-law decision is affirmed and a question certified to the Rhode\r                                                                           \n\nIsland  Supreme  Court, with  jurisdiction retained  pending that\r                                                                           \n\ndetermination.\r                       \n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\n                   UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\r                            UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                      FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\r                                FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                                         \n\nNo. 94-1276\n\n                     CPC INTERNATIONAL, INC.,\n\n                      Plaintiff - Appellant,\n\n                                v.\n\n                   NORTHBROOK EXCESS &amp; SURPLUS\n                        INSURANCE COMPANY,\n\n                      Defendant - Appellee.\n\n                                        \n\n                          CERTIFICATION\n                                        \n\n          This  Court hereby certifies a question of Rhode Island\n\nstate law to the Rhode  Island Supreme Court, pursuant to Rule  6\n\nof the Rhode  Island Supreme Court Rules  of Appellate Procedure,\n\nand provides a brief statement of the grounds for certification.\n\n          The  insurance policy  at issue  in CPC  Int'l  Inc. v.\r                                                                        \n\nNorthbrook Excess &amp; Surplus Ins.

(\"CPC\"), filed this action seeking a declaration that defendant-appellee, Northbrook Excess &amp; Surplus Insurance Company (\"Northbrook\"), is obligated to indemnify it for environmental cleanup costs related to land and water contamination allegedly caused by Peterson/Puritan, Inc.  (\"Peterson/Puritan\"), a former subsidiary of CPC.  At the close of CPC's evidence in the jury trial of the case, the district court granted Northbrook's motion, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), for judgment as a matter of law.  CPC appeals 1) the district court's pretrial choice-of-law decision predicting that a New Jersey court would apply the substantive law of Rhode Island and 2) the district court's grant of judgment as a matter of law.  For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the district court's choice-of-law decision and certify a question to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ultimate issue in this case is whether Northbrook is obligated to indemnify CPC for environmental cleanup costs related to land and water contamination caused by Peterson/Puritan, an aerosol packaging plant formerly owned by CPC.  CPC is a multinational packaging and manufacturing corporation headquartered in New Jersey.  From July 1, 1979 to July 1, 1980, Northbrook served as CPC's first layer excess insurance carrier, with a $25 million umbrella liability policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1968, CPC acquired the Puritan Aerosol Company and renamed it Peterson/Puritan.  Peterson/Puritan manufactures, among other things, flea spray, hair spray, spot remover and oven cleaner.  Its manufacturing facility is located in the town of Cumberland, Rhode Island, on a seventeen-acre site (\"the Peterson-Puritan site\") fronted on its western side by the Blackstone River.  In 1979, both Cumberland and the neighboring town of Lincoln discovered chemical contamination in their municipal water supplies, the Quinnville Wellfields.  The wells were closed later that year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1980, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") hired the environmental engineering firm Goldberg-Zoino and Associates to conduct a hydrogeological study of the aquifer underlying the Blackstone River (the \"GZA Report\").  In 1982, based on the results of the GZA Report, the Town of Lincoln sued Peterson/Puritan for contamination of the Quinnville Wells.  That suit was settled in 1984 for $780,000.  The settlement was paid by Northwestern National Insurance Company (\"Northwestern National\"), CPC's primary insurance carrier, under a policy with a coverage limit of $1 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1983, EPA placed an area including the Peterson/Puritan site and the aquifer east of the Blackstone River (designated by the EPA as \"OU-1\") on its National Priorities List.  In 1987, following several years of negotiations, EPA issued an Administrative Order by Consent, pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), 42 U.S.C. Sec. 9601 et seq., which identified Peterson/Puritan as the party responsible for numerous hazardous chemicals migrating into the groundwater, and ordered Peterson/Puritan to investigate additional responsible parties and further analyze site conditions.  Later that year, Northwestern National informed CPC and Northbrook that the primary insurance policy was exhausted, thus bringing Northbrook into the fold.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July of 1987, CPC filed suit against Northbrook in New Jersey state court seeking a declaration that Northbrook is obligated to indemnify it for environmental cleanup costs and damages arising from the Town of Lincoln settlement and the EPA-ordered cleanup.  On the basis of diversity jurisdiction, Northbrook removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.  In 1989, the New Jersey district court granted Northbrook's motion to transfer venue to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the transfer, CPC filed a motion for a declaration that the substantive law of New Jersey governs this litigation.  In an Opinion dated June 21, 1990, the Rhode Island district court concluded, first, that in ruling upon the choice-of-law issue it must apply the law of the state which would have been applied had the change of venue not occurred and, second, that a New Jersey court would apply New Jersey law to this case because, as the home base of the insured, CPC, it has the most significant interest in the outcome of the case.  CPC Int'l, Inc. v. Northbrook Excess &amp; Surplus Ins. Co., 739 F.Supp. 710, 713-15 (D.R.I.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment and, on March 15, 1991, the district court denied CPC's motion for summary judgment and allowed Northbrook's cross-motion on the ground that the pollution exclusion clause in Northbrook's policy precluded coverage for gradual pollution.  The district court concluded that CPC failed to sustain its burden of establishing a genuine issue of fact with respect to whether the contamination of the aquifer was \"sudden and accidental,\" within the meaning of New Jersey law, and therefore held that the pollution exclusion applied.  CPC Int'l, Inc. v. Northbrook Excess &amp; Surplus Ins. Co., 759 F.Supp. 966, 976 (D.R.I.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CPC appealed and, on March 24, 1992, we reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment for Northbrook and remanded the case to the district court.  We concluded that, in predicting how the New Jersey Supreme Court would interpret the \"sudden and accidental\" provision, the district court gave insufficient weight to decisions of the New Jersey Superior Court's Appellate Division (New Jersey's intermediate appellate court), which had concluded that the \"sudden and accidental\" provision is ambiguous and had interpreted it favorably to insureds as providing coverage for gradual pollution.  See CPC Int'l, Inc. v. Northbrook Excess and Surplus Ins. Co., 962 F.2d 77, 97-98, reh'g denied, 962 F.2d 98 (1st Cir.1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the case was remanded, Northbrook moved for reconsideration of the district court's 1990 choice-of-law decision.  In a Memorandum and Order dated December 16, 1993, 839 F.Supp. 124 (the \"Second Choice-of-Law Decision\"), the district court granted Northbrook's motion, holding that the substantive law of Rhode Island would henceforth govern the case.  We denied CPC's petition for mandamus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case went to trial on January 28, 1994.  Over eleven days, CPC offered testimony from several witnesses, including three experts, and employees of the former Peterson/Puritan facility.  At the close of CPC's evidence, Northbrook moved for judgment as a matter of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a).  On February 16, 1994, the district court delivered a detailed oral opinion concluding that CPC had failed to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that there was an \"occurrence\"--an event resulting in property damage--during the policy period.   The district court therefore granted Northbrook's motion for judgment as a matter of law.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's choice-of-law decision de novo.  See Crellin Technologies, Inc. v. Equipmentlease Corp., 18 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1994).  With respect to the district court's grant of judgment as a matter of law, we note, at the outset, that judgment as a matter of law is proper at the close of the plaintiffs' case only when, after scrutinizing plaintiffs' evidence and the inferences reasonably to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the trial court concludes that no reasonable jury could find in plaintiffs' favor on any permissible claim or theory.  Rolon-Alvarado v. Municipality of San Juan, 1 F.3d 74, 76 (1st Cir.1993).  Judgment as a matter of law may be entered only if the evidence, viewed from this perspective, is such that reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the Rule 50(a) motion decision de novo, see Salve Regina Coll. v. Russell, 499 U.S. 225, 231-32, 111 S.Ct. 1217, 1220-22, 113 L.Ed.2d 190 (1991);  Jordan-Milton Mach., Inc. v. F/V Teresa Marie, II, 978 F.2d 32, 34 (1st Cir.1992), under the same standards governing the district court, Rolon-Alvarado, 1 F.3d at 76, with a view to the legal sufficiency of the evidence presented by the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CPC contends that the district court erred, first, in determining that Rhode Island law would govern the case, after previously determining that New Jersey law would govern, and, second, in concluding that CPC had failed to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could find in its favor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Choice of Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CPC asserts that the district court erred in changing its original choice-of-law determination.  CPC makes two related arguments in support of this assertion.  First, CPC contends that the district court violated the \"law of the case\" doctrine in changing its original choice-of-law ruling.  Second, CPC maintains that the district court's second choice-of-law ruling was erroneous--i.e., that a New Jersey court would not apply the substantive law of Rhode Island to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its original choice-of-law decision, the district court ruled that a New Jersey court would apply the substantive law of New Jersey to the facts of this case.  The court concluded that, under New Jersey's choice-of-law rules, New Jersey, as the location of the insured, has the strongest interest in the outcome of the case.  The court rejected Northbrook's contention that the substantive law of Rhode Island, the site of the contamination, or, in the alternative, the law of Illinois, the state in which the insurer accepted the risk, should apply.  Northbrook sought, unsuccessfully, to have the choice-of-law question certified to this court.  The district court then granted Northbrook's motion for summary judgment under New Jersey law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reversing the district court's summary judgment ruling, we noted that the district court's June 21, 1990 choice-of-law decision that New Jersey law governs was not questioned on appeal and that, therefore, it \"is law of the case.\"  CPC Int'l, 962 F.2d at 91.   We rejected Northbrook's petition for rehearing on the choice-of-law issue, concluding that Northbrook did not preserve the issue on appeal.  After the case was remanded, Northbrook filed a motion requesting that the district court reconsider its previous choice-of-law ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its Second Choice-of-Law Decision, the district court made two related rulings.  First, the district court decided that the New Jersey Supreme Court's recent decision in Gilbert Spruance Co. v. Pennsylvania Manufacturers' Ass'n Insurance Co., 134 N.J. 96, 629 A.2d 885 (1993), represents \"a clear and contrary change in the law applicable to the case\" and, therefore, that \"the law of the case presumption is overcome.\"   Second, the court held that a New Jersey court, applying the newly articulated principles of Gilbert Spruance, would apply the substantive law of Rhode Island to the facts of this case and, therefore, that Rhode Island law, rather than New Jersey law, would govern this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted previously, under normal circumstances we review de novo a district court's choice of the substantive law to apply in a particular case.  In this case, however, an additional consideration guides our review of the district court's choice-of-law decision.  Under the \"law of the case\" doctrine, a decision by an appellate court on a particular issue, unless vacated or set aside, governs the issue during all subsequent stages of the litigation.  United States v. Rivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d 148, 151 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 862, 112 S.Ct. 184, 116 L.Ed.2d 145 (1991).  The law of the case doctrine bars litigants from rearguing issues previously decided on appeal.  See, e.g., United States v. Rosen, 929 F.2d 839, 842 n. 5 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 819, 112 S.Ct. 77, 116 L.Ed.2d 51 (1991);  United States v. DeJesus, 752 F.2d 640, 642-43 (1st Cir.1985);  White v. Murtha, 377 F.2d 428, 431 (5th Cir.1967).  The doctrine is based on considerations of \"stability in the decisionmaking process, predictability of results, proper working relationships between trial and appellate courts, and judicial economy.\"  United States v. Connell, 6 F.3d 27, 30 (1st Cir.1993).  Under the law of the case doctrine, when a trial court, on remand, seeks to dispose of a case in accordance with an appellate court's mandate, it \" 'must implement both the letter and the spirit of the mandate, taking into account the appellate court's opinion and the circumstances it embraces.' \"  Id. (quoting United States v. Kikumura, 947 F.2d 72, 76 (3d Cir.1991)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law of the case was not intended, however, to serve as an absolute bar to reconsideration, nor a limitation on a federal court's power.  Rivera- Martinez, 931 F.2d at 151.   We have, therefore, recognized that a district court may, as an exception to the law of the case doctrine, reexamine a previous ruling when \"controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of the law applicable to such issues....\"  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  CPC argues that the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision in Gilbert Spruance does not represent \"a contrary decision of the law applicable\" to the district court's original choice-of-law decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court's conclusion that Gilbert Spruance represents a decision which is contrary to the law as applied by the district court in its original choice-of-law decision.  We also think that, although Gilbert Spruance does not necessarily mandate the decision reached by the district court, it certainly provides ample support for the district court's prediction that the New Jersey Supreme Court, if faced with the question, would conclude that Rhode Island law should govern this dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its original choice-of-law ruling, the district court analyzed a host of decisions by the New Jersey Appellate Division.  The district court also reviewed what was, at the time, the New Jersey Supreme Court's most recent decision concerning choice-of-law in the liability-insurance context--State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co. v. Estate of Simmons, 84 N.J. 28, 417 A.2d 488 (1980)--and predicted that a New Jersey court would consider New Jersey, the location of the insured's principal headquarters, the state with the strongest interest in the outcome of the case.  In eliminating the law of Rhode Island as a possibility, the district court relied on the Appellate Division's decision in Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 233 N.J.Super. 463, 559 A.2d 435 (App.Div.1989), which adopted the \"uniform-contract-interpretation\" approach to choice-of-law determinations.  Under that approach, policy interpretation should be uniform nationwide and not vary according to the location of the risk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the district court's first choice-of-law opinion, State Farm was the controlling decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court with respect to choice-of-law issues in the liability-insurance context.  State Farm held that, because the law of the place of contract \"generally comport[s] with the reasonable expectations of the parties concerning the principal situs of the insured risk,\" that state's law should be applied \"unless the dominant and significant relationship of another state to the parties and the underlying issue dictates that this basic rule should yield.\"  State Farm, 84 N.J. at 37, 417 A.2d 488.  State Farm directs courts, in making that determination, to rely on the factors and contacts set forth in sections 6 and 188 of Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws (1971).  Id. at 34-35, 417 A.2d 488.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Thus, State Farm creates a rebuttable presumption that the law of the state where the contract was entered into will govern the dispute.  See J. Josephson, Inc. v. Crum &amp; Forster Ins. Co., 265 N.J.Super. 230, 239, 626 A.2d 81, 86 (Law.Div.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilbert Spruance changes the presumption by rejecting the \"uniform-contract-interpretation approach\" and adopting the \"site-specific\" approach to choice-of-law determinations in the casualty-insurance context.  See Gilbert Spruance, 134 N.J. at 111-14, 629 A.2d 885.   The New Jersey Supreme Court now directs courts to look, first, to section 193 of Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws, which sets forth the site-specific rule by creating a presumption that a casualty-insurance policy be interpreted under the substantive law of the state that \"the parties understood was to be the principal location of the insured risk, unless some other state has a more significant relationship\" to the parties, the transaction, and the outcome of the controversy under a Restatement section 6 analysis.  Gilbert Spruance, 134 N.J. at 111, 629 A.2d 885 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws Sec. 193).  Gilbert Spruance also provides that when the subject matter of the insurance is a predictably multistate operation or activity, \"the significance of the principal location of the insured risk diminishes,\" and \"the governing law is that of the state with the dominant significant relationship according to the principles set forth in Restatement section 6.\"  Id. (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gilbert Spruance decision resolved a conflict among different panels of New Jersey's Appellate Division by specifically rejecting the \"uniform-contract-interpretation approach\" to choice-of-law determinations and adopting the \"site-specific\" approach.  Compare Westinghouse, 559 A.2d 435;  with Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Surety Co., 258 N.J.Super. 167, 609 A.2d 440 (App.Div.1992) (interest of state where pollution site lies is \"more dominant and significant\");  Johnson Matthey, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Mfrs. Ass'n Ins. Co., 250 N.J.Super. 51, 593 A.2d 367 (App.Div.1991) (interest of state where pollution site lies is \"paramount\").  In its initial choice-of-law ruling, the district court relied on the reasoning behind the Westinghouse court's adoption of the uniform-contract-interpretation approach in determining that the law of Rhode Island, the location of the risk, should not govern this case.  CPC Int'l, 739 F.Supp. at 714.   The Gilbert Spruance court's rejection of the uniform-contract-interpretation is therefore a highly significant change in the controlling authority.  It changes the equation upon which the district court relied in making its initial choice of law decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was obligated to predict which state's substantive law the New Jersey Supreme Court would apply to the facts of this case, a task made all the more difficult because New Jersey does not have a procedure for certifying questions.  In our view, the principles announced by the New Jersey Supreme Court represent a significant change in the law applicable to the district court's choice-of-law decision.  We conclude, therefore, that the district court's departure from the law of the case was justified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also conclude, on de novo review, that the district court's prediction that the New Jersey Supreme Court would apply the law of Rhode Island in this case is supported by New Jersey case law, particularly the principles announced in Gilbert Spruance.   Under the site-specific rule adopted by Gilbert Spruance, it is presumed that the substantive law of the state which is the principal location of the insured risk governs, unless another state has a more significant overall interest in the case.  Gilbert Spruance, 134 N.J. at 112, 629 A.2d 885.   New Jersey's only connection with the case is that CPC's headquarters are located in New Jersey.  Moreover, Gilbert Spruance explained that \"[w]hen the waste-producing facility and the waste site are located in the same state, their common location makes the application of [the Restatement's choice-of-law factors] straightforward.\"  Id. at 107, 629 A.2d 885.   As the district court noted, in this case the waste was both generated and disposed of in Rhode Island.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CPC argues that Gilbert Spruance explicitly left open the question of whose law would apply in a case such as this.  CPC cites the following language in support of this proposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no occasion to consider in this appeal the problem presented when waste generated in New Jersey predictably is disposed of in another state....  Specifically, we express no view on the proposition ... that when another state is the foreseeable location of the waste-site, the court must engage in a section 6 analysis to determine if that state has the most significant relationship with [the case].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 113-14, 629 A.2d 885.   In our view, this language merely leaves open the possibility that when waste is generated in New Jersey and disposed of in another state, New Jersey law might still apply.  As noted, in this case, the waste was both generated and disposed of in Rhode Island.  Under such circumstances, there is every reason to predict that the New Jersey Supreme Court would recognize with equal vigilance the \"urgent concern for the health and safety of [Rhode Island's] citizens\" implicated by the generation and dumping of toxic waste in that state.  See id. at 113, 629 A.2d 885 (quoting Johnson Matthey, 250 N.J.Super. at 57, 593 A.2d 367).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's decision that the New Jersey Supreme Court would apply the substantive law of Rhode Island in this case.  We now turn to the merits of this appeal--the district court's decision granting Northbrook's motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Grant of Judgment as a Matter of Law</p>\n    <p>1. The Policy Provisions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Northbrook issued a comprehensive liability policy to CPC which was in effect from July 1, 1979 through July 1, 1980.  Pursuant to that policy, Northbrook agreed to indemnify CPC for personal injuries, property damage and/or advertising liability \"caused by or arising out of each Occurrence happening anywhere in the world.\"   The policy defines \"property damage\" as \"loss of or direct damage to or destruction of tangible property (other than property owned by an insured) and which results in an Occurrence during the policy period.\"   The policy defines \"Occurrence\" as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>an accident, event or happening including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which results, during the policy period, in Personal Injury, Property Damage or Advertising Liability neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the Insured</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>.... All such Personal Injury, Property Damage or Advertising Injury caused by one event or repeated exposure to substantially the same conditions shall be deemed to result from one Occurrence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. The District Court Decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ruling upon Northbrook's motion for judgment as a matter of law, the district court made the following pertinent findings of fact.  Between 1963 and the late 1970s, Peterson/Puritan polluted the environment in the area of its plant in Cumberland, Rhode Island.  Peterson/Puritan employees routinely dumped chemicals, including volatile organic compounds (\"VOCs\"), into the drain and septic systems.  In 1974, a railroad tank container at Peterson/Puritan spilled causing approximately 6,200 gallons of the solvent perchloroethylene to spill onto and into the soil (the \"1974 PERC spill\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The theory of the case presented by CPC at trial, primarily through the testimony of two expert witnesses, was that prior to the 1974 PERC spill, the VOCs dumped from Peterson/Puritan were in the soil but, because of the presence of silt and clay, had not reached groundwater.  In other words, they were stagnant.  Dr. Tod Delaney testified that the PERC spill mobilized these VOCs in the soil and led them into the groundwater and, eventually, the combined force travelled a several thousand foot path to the Quinnville Wells.  Dr. Delaney testified that, but for the 1974 PERC spill, there would have been no pollution of the Quinnville Wells.  Dr. Delaney also testified that the leading edge of the 1974 PERC spill reached and contaminated the Quinnville Wells in 1979, during the policy period.  Pollution of the Quinnville Wellfields was discovered in October 1979, during the policy period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its detailed oral opinion granting judgment as a matter of law for Northbrook, the district court reasoned that, because the policy was only in effect from July 1, 1979 to July 1, 1980, the burden at trial was upon CPC to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that there was an \"occurrence\" during that period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court stated that CPC's theory at trial was that because the EPA desires to reopen the Quinnville Wells, and cleaning the aquifer is directly related to that goal, the \"occurrence\" for purposes of insurance should be measured by when the contamination of the wells occurred.  The difficulty with this theory, as the district court explained, is that the Town of Lincoln's claim against Peterson/Puritan to clean up the Quinnville Wells had been settled in 1984 and Northwood had paid the settlement under its insurance policy.  The present action concerns the EPA's claims against CPC regarding the aquifer east of the Blackstone River--the area designated by the EPA as OU-1--not the Quinnville Wells.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court stated that whatever the EPA's motivations concerning reactivating the Quinnville Wells in the future may be, \"the fact of the matter is that the area being remediated is east of the Blackstone River.\"   The court then concluded that the \"occurrence\" in this case took place before the policy became effective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>The plaintiff seeks to recover the costs of remediation of the aquifer east of the Blackstone River from this defendant.  The evidence is clear in this case from the experts presented by the plaintiff, that the aquifer was damaged within the meaning of the policy when it was polluted by the PERC spill in 1974 within days or at best, weeks of June 21, 1974 when this PERC spill took place, five years or more before July 1, 1979 when this policy took effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because it found that the \"occurrence\" took place before the policy came into effect, the district court concluded that, as a matter of law, Northbrook was not obligated to indemnify CPC.  The district court explained that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>If there is a principle of insurance law that means anything it is the principle that insurance protects a policyholder against future contingent events.  It is not for the purpose of providing compensation for events that have already taken place, and that is so under the law of New Jersey, Rhode Island, the First Circuit, or any other jurisdiction within the United States.  So, simply on that ground alone, the occurrence in this case clearly took place before the policy became effective, there can be no recovery of the remediation costs from this insurance carrier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also rejected CPC's case for another reason.  The court, accepting arguendo CPC's theory that remediation of the aquifer is tied in with reopening the Quinnville Wells, concluded that CPC had failed to sustain its burden of showing that damage to the Quinnville Wells took place during the policy period.  Dr. Willard Murray testified that, depending upon the undetermined porosity of the soil, the leading edge of the PERC plume reached the Quinnville Wells between October or November 1978, and December 1981.  Reviewing that testimony, the district court noted that it is \"just as probable that that army of VOC's led by the PERC arrived at the Quinnville Wells in 1978 or early 1979 as it is that it arrived after July 1, 1979.\"   The district court therefore concluded that \"[n]o jury could find that this pollution plume arrived at the Quinnville Wells after July 1, 1979 without completely speculating.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that there is \"no possibility\" that CPC could recover from Northbrook for the costs of remediation of the OU-1 area and, therefore, granted Northbrook's motion.  In conclusion, the court stated that \"[t]his case is being decided on general principles of law and it really doesn't matter whose law applies in this case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By declining to look specifically to the controlling law in this case, the law of Rhode Island, the district court essentially held that, under general principles of insurance law, there is one trigger date for calculating the time when an \"occurrence\" causing \"property damage\" takes place;  or, at least that, if there is more than one possible trigger date, CPC could not recover under any of them.  In fact, there are at least seven trigger dates utilized by different jurisdictions for determining the time at which an occurrence causing property damage takes place.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Moreover, as discussed below, CPC could possibly recover under one or more of these theories.  Thus, it is critical to determine which trigger theory of coverage Rhode Island would apply to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, there are at least seven theories used in different jurisdictions for determining when an occurrence policy provision is triggered.  See generally In re Acushnet River &amp; New Bedford Harbor:  Proceedings re Alleged PCB Pollution, 725 F.Supp. 1264, 1274-75 (D.Mass.1989) (describing the seven standards), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds sub nom., Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. Belleville Indus., Inc., 938 F.2d 1423 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1073, 112 S.Ct. 969, 117 L.Ed.2d 134 (1992).  These seven theories or standards are as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the wrongful act theory would hold that the occurrence causing property damage took place when the 1974 PERC spill occurred.  Second, the exposure theory would hold that the occurrence causing property damage took place when the VOCs leeched into the environment.  See Continental Ins. Cos. v. Northeastern Pharmaceutical and Chem.  Co., 811 F.2d 1180, 1189 (8th Cir.1987), modified on other grounds after reh'g en banc, 842 F.2d 977 (8th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 821, 109 S.Ct. 66, 102 L.Ed.2d 43 (1988).  Third, the injury-in-fact theory would hold that the occurrence causing damage to property took place when the level of VOCs was such that the aquifer was actually injured or contaminated.  See American Home Products Corp. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 748 F.2d 760, 765 (2d Cir.1984).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Fourth, the manifestation theory would hold that the occurrence causing property damage took place when the damage became \"reasonably capable of ... diagnosis.\"  Eagle Picher Indus., Inc. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 682 F.2d 12, 25 (1st Cir.1982) (applying the law of Ohio and Indiana), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1028, 103 S.Ct. 1280, 75 L.Ed.2d 500 (1983);  American Home Assurance Co. v. Libbey-Owens-Ford Co., 786 F.2d 22, 30 (1st Cir.1986) (applying Ohio law).  Fifth, the first discovery theory would hold that the occurrence causing damage to property took place when the property owner actually discovered the pollution.  Pittsburgh Corning Corp. v. Travelers Indem. Co., No. 84-3985, 1988 WL 5291 (E.D.Pa. Jan. 21, 1988).  The sixth theory is a combination of the fourth and fifth.  Under this theory, the occurrence causing damage to property took place when the insured \"knew or should have known\" of the property damage.  See In re Acushnet, 725 F.Supp. at 1274 n. 17 (citing Bartholomew v. Insurance Co. of North America, 502 F.Supp. 246, 252-54 (D.R.I.1980), aff'd, 655 F.2d 27 (1st Cir.1981).  Finally, the continuous trigger theory would hold that the occurrence causing property damage took place both at the time of exposure and at the time of manifestation.  Keene v. Insurance Co. of North America, 667 F.2d 1034, 1047 (D.C.Cir.1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 1007, 102 S.Ct. 1644, 71 L.Ed.2d 875 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of which trigger theory to apply is critical in this case.  If the Rhode Island Supreme Court would apply the wrongful act, exposure, or injury-in-fact theories, the district court's decision should be affirmed.  If the Rhode Island Supreme Court would apply the manifestation, first discovery, or \"reasonably knew or should have known\" theories, the case should be remanded to the district court for a new trial.  The reason for this is that, based on the testimony at trial, a reasonable jury could have found that the 1974 PERC spill caused the VOCs to migrate to the Quinnville Wells and that the PERC-led contaminants reached the wells before October 1979.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Under the manifestation theory, a reasonable jury would be entitled to infer, based on CPC's uncontroverted evidence, that the first time CPC should have known of damage to the aquifer was in October 1979, when the contamination of the Quinnville Wells was discovered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  It follows that the same holds true for the first discovery and \"knew or should have known\" theories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was obligated to determine which of these trigger-of-coverage theories the Rhode Island Supreme Court would apply in this case.  Because it did not, we have endeavored to do so here.  In the end, however, we conclude that Rhode Island law is unclear as to which trigger-of-coverage is to be applied and, therefore, choose to certify the question to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CPC argues that Bartholomew, a case from the United States District Court for Rhode Island, purporting to apply Rhode Island law, is the controlling Rhode Island precedent.  Bartholomew holds that the date of the occurrence is the date when the insured \"knew or should have known\" of the property damage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Northbrook, on the other hand, maintains that the Rhode Island Supreme Court's recent decision in Textron, Inc. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 639 A.2d 1358 (R.I.1994), indicates that Rhode Island follows the \"injury-in-fact\" theory--i.e., the date of an occurrence is the date when the property damage occurs.  We agree that Bartholomew and Textron are the most apt cases from Rhode Island on the trigger-of-coverage issue.  Our analysis of the two cases, however, leads us to the conclusion that they raise more questions than they answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court in Bartholomew, finding no Rhode Island law on the subject, predicted that the Rhode Island Supreme Court would adopt the \"reasonably knew or should have known\" trigger-of-coverage standard.  There are several difficulties with this case as an indicator of Rhode Island law.  First, our research indicates that no Rhode Island court has either explicitly adopted or rejected the Bartholomew standard;  in fact, to our knowledge, no Rhode Island court has ever even cited Bartholomew.   Second, our decision affirming the district court in that case did not explicitly comment on the standard adopted by the district court, but rather relied on the more fundamental fact that the \"defects were fully known, indeed sued for, before the policies took effect.\"   Thus, we commented, \"[w]e can only construe the present action as an attempt to 'job' the defendants.\"  Bartholomew v. Appalachian Ins. Co., 655 F.2d 27, 29 (1st Cir.1981).  Finally, and most importantly, if Bartholomew is in conflict with Textron, obviously the Rhode Island Supreme Court decision controls the present diversity action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a footnote in Textron, Inc. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 639 A.2d 1358 (1994), the Rhode Island Supreme Court made the following statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p>In the area of general-liability insurance, an occurrence policy provides coverage for any \"occurrence\" which takes place during the policy period.  Under this type of policy it is irrelevant whether the resulting claim is brought against the insured during or after the policy period, as long as the injury-causing event happens during the policy period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1361 n. 1 (emphasis added) (citing DiLuglio v. New England Ins. Co., 959 F.2d 355, 358 (1st Cir.1992) and Gereboff v. the Home Indemnity Co., 119 R.I. 814, 818 n. 1, 383 A.2d 1024, 1026 n. 1 (1978)).  Northbrook maintains that this statement indicates that Rhode Island looks to the point when the injury in fact occurs as the trigger date for coverage.  Although we agree that it could be read that way, we have several concerns about the reliability of this general statement as a predictor of Rhode Island law in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the statement in Textron is entirely dictum;  it appears only in a very general fashion and in a footnote;  and it was not relevant to decision of the case.  In Textron, an insured sought indemnification for property damage which allegedly occurred during the coverage period but which was not reported until twenty-one years after the last policy's expiration.  The case was disposed of, in favor of the insurer, pursuant to a policy provision which required that the insured report the property damage within one year of the expiration of the policy.  Textron, 639 A.2d at 1363.   Thus, the outcome of the case in no way depended upon the language in the footnote.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Textron does not cite Bartholomew, a case purportedly applying Rhode Island law, which is cited extensively by courts in the First Circuit and other jurisdictions, and which adopts an entirely different standard.  We think this raises questions as to exactly how broad a sweep the Textron court intended its statement to have.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the phrase \"injury-causing event\" could (we think reasonably) be interpreted as either of three potential trigger theories.  It could mean Rhode Island uses the \"wrongful act theory\" in its trigger of coverage analysis, which in this case would be the 1974 PERC spill.  It could mean, as Northbrook argues, that Rhode Island follows the injury-in-fact theory.  Here, according to CPC's own expert witnesses, the injury in fact would have occurred within days of the 1974 PERC spill.  Finally, it could refer to the exposure theory.  In this case, that would have been when the VOCs leeched into the environment--within minutes of the 1974 PERC spill.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Moreover, as the Bartholomew court noted, the wrongful act theory, which we think is the most literal reading of \"injury-causing event,\" \"has been rejected by the vast majority of jurisdictions.\"  Bartholomew, 502 F.Supp. at 253 (citing Annotation, 57 A.L.R.2d 1358 (1958)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we think that the law of Rhode Island is \"unclear\" with respect to the trigger-of-coverage issue.  See Lehman Brothers v. Schein, 416 U.S. 386, 94 S.Ct. 1741, 40 L.Ed.2d 215 (1974).  We also think that the trigger-of-coverage issue is determinative of this appeal.  We therefore conclude that the most appropriate way to resolve the trigger of coverage issue, consistent both with our duty to apply Rhode Island law and with important principles of federalism, is to certify the question to the Rhode Island Supreme Court pursuant to Rule 6 of the Rhode Island Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's choice-of-law decision is affirmed and a question certified to the Rhode Island Supreme Court, with jurisdiction retained pending that determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CERTIFICATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court hereby certifies a question of Rhode Island state law to the Rhode Island Supreme Court, pursuant to Rule 6 of the Rhode Island Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, and provides a brief statement of the grounds for certification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The insurance policy at issue in CPC Int'l Inc. v. Northbrook Excess &amp; Surplus Ins. Co., No. 94-1276, requires that the \"occurrence\" causing \"property damage\" must take place during the policy period in order for coverage to be provided.  In the body of its Opinion in that case, this Court has identified seven different approaches used by courts in different jurisdictions for determining when an injury takes place in order to trigger coverage.  The different approaches are:  the wrongful act theory, the exposure theory, the injury-in-fact theory, the manifestation theory, the first discovery theory, the \"reasonably knew or should have known\" theory, and the continuous trigger theory.

(\"CPC\"), filed this action seeking a declaration that defendant-appellee, Northbrook Excess &amp; Surplus Insurance Company (\"Northbrook\"), is obligated to indemnify it for environmental cleanup costs related to land and water contamination allegedly caused by Peterson/Puritan, Inc.  (\"Peterson/Puritan\"), a former subsidiary of CPC.  At the close of CPC's evidence in the jury trial of the case, the district court granted Northbrook's motion, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), for judgment as a matter of law.  CPC appeals 1) the district court's pretrial choice-of-law decision predicting that a New Jersey court would apply the substantive law of Rhode Island and 2) the district court's grant of judgment as a matter of law.  For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the district court's choice-of-law decision and certify a question to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ultimate issue in this case is whether Northbrook is obligated to indemnify CPC for environmental cleanup costs related to land and water contamination caused by Peterson/Puritan, an aerosol packaging plant formerly owned by CPC.  CPC is a multinational packaging and manufacturing corporation headquartered in New Jersey.  From July 1, 1979 to July 1, 1980, Northbrook served as CPC's first layer excess insurance carrier, with a $25 million umbrella liability policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1968, CPC acquired the Puritan Aerosol Company and renamed it Peterson/Puritan.  Peterson/Puritan manufactures, among other things, flea spray, hair spray, spot remover and oven cleaner.  Its manufacturing facility is located in the town of Cumberland, Rhode Island, on a seventeen-acre site (\"the Peterson-Puritan site\") fronted on its western side by the Blackstone River.  In 1979, both Cumberland and the neighboring town of Lincoln discovered chemical contamination in their municipal water supplies, the Quinnville Wellfields.  The wells were closed later that year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1980, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") hired the environmental engineering firm Goldberg-Zoino and Associates to conduct a hydrogeological study of the aquifer underlying the Blackstone River (the \"GZA Report\").  In 1982, based on the results of the GZA Report, the Town of Lincoln sued Peterson/Puritan for contamination of the Quinnville Wells.  That suit was settled in 1984 for $780,000.  The settlement was paid by Northwestern National Insurance Company (\"Northwestern National\"), CPC's primary insurance carrier, under a policy with a coverage limit of $1 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1983, EPA placed an area including the Peterson/Puritan site and the aquifer east of the Blackstone River (designated by the EPA as \"OU-1\") on its National Priorities List.  In 1987, following several years of negotiations, EPA issued an Administrative Order by Consent, pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), 42 U.S.C. Sec. 9601 et seq., which identified Peterson/Puritan as the party responsible for numerous hazardous chemicals migrating into the groundwater, and ordered Peterson/Puritan to investigate additional responsible parties and further analyze site conditions.  Later that year, Northwestern National informed CPC and Northbrook that the primary insurance policy was exhausted, thus bringing Northbrook into the fold.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July of 1987, CPC filed suit against Northbrook in New Jersey state court seeking a declaration that Northbrook is obligated to indemnify it for environmental cleanup costs and damages arising from the Town of Lincoln settlement and the EPA-ordered cleanup.  On the basis of diversity jurisdiction, Northbrook removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.  In 1989, the New Jersey district court granted Northbrook's motion to transfer venue to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the transfer, CPC filed a motion for a declaration that the substantive law of New Jersey governs this litigation.  In an Opinion dated June 21, 1990, the Rhode Island district court concluded, first, that in ruling upon the choice-of-law issue it must apply the law of the state which would have been applied had the change of venue not occurred and, second, that a New Jersey court would apply New Jersey law to this case because, as the home base of the insured, CPC, it has the most significant interest in the outcome of the case.

The district court concluded that CPC failed to sustain its burden of establishing a genuine issue of fact with respect to whether the contamination of the aquifer was \"sudden and accidental,\" within the meaning of New Jersey law, and therefore held that the pollution exclusion applied.

We concluded that, in predicting how the New Jersey Supreme Court would interpret the \"sudden and accidental\" provision, the district court gave insufficient weight to decisions of the New Jersey Superior Court's Appellate Division (New Jersey's intermediate appellate court), which had concluded that the \"sudden and accidental\" provision is ambiguous and had interpreted it favorably to insureds as providing coverage for gradual pollution.

Over eleven days, CPC offered testimony from several witnesses, including three experts, and employees of the former Peterson/Puritan facility.  At the close of CPC's evidence, Northbrook moved for judgment as a matter of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a).  On February 16, 1994, the district court delivered a detailed oral opinion concluding that CPC had failed to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that there was an \"occurrence\"--an event resulting in property damage--during the policy period.   The district court therefore granted Northbrook's motion for judgment as a matter of law.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's choice-of-law decision de novo.

With respect to the district court's grant of judgment as a matter of law, we note, at the outset, that judgment as a matter of law is proper at the close of the plaintiffs' case only when, after scrutinizing plaintiffs' evidence and the inferences reasonably to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the trial court concludes that no reasonable jury could find in plaintiffs' favor on any permissible claim or theory.

Choice of Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CPC asserts that the district court erred in changing its original choice-of-law determination.  CPC makes two related arguments in support of this assertion.  First, CPC contends that the district court violated the \"law of the case\" doctrine in changing its original choice-of-law ruling.  Second, CPC maintains that the district court's second choice-of-law ruling was erroneous--i.e., that a New Jersey court would not apply the substantive law of Rhode Island to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its original choice-of-law decision, the district court ruled that a New Jersey court would apply the substantive law of New Jersey to the facts of this case.  The court concluded that, under New Jersey's choice-of-law rules, New Jersey, as the location of the insured, has the strongest interest in the outcome of the case.  The court rejected Northbrook's contention that the substantive law of Rhode Island, the site of the contamination, or, in the alternative, the law of Illinois, the state in which the insurer accepted the risk, should apply.  Northbrook sought, unsuccessfully, to have the choice-of-law question certified to this court.  The district court then granted Northbrook's motion for summary judgment under New Jersey law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reversing the district court's summary judgment ruling, we noted that the district court's June 21, 1990 choice-of-law decision that New Jersey law governs was not questioned on appeal and that, therefore, it \"is law of the case.\"  CPC <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582531\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Int'l,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/582531/cpc-international-inc-v-northbrook-excess-surplus-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span>.   We rejected Northbrook's petition for rehearing on the choice-of-law issue, concluding that Northbrook did not preserve the issue on appeal.  After the case was remanded, Northbrook filed a motion requesting that the district court reconsider its previous choice-of-law ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its Second Choice-of-Law Decision, the district court made two related rulings.  First, the district court decided that the New Jersey Supreme Court's recent decision in Gilbert Spruance Co. v. Pennsylvania Manufacturers' Ass'n Insurance Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2062942\"><a href=\"/opinion/2062942/gilbert-spruance-v-pennsylvania-mfrs/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2062942\"><a href=\"/opinion/2062942/gilbert-spruance-v-pennsylvania-mfrs/\"><span class=\"volume\">629</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span> </a></span>(1993), represents \"a clear and contrary change in the law applicable to the case\" and, therefore, that \"the law of the case presumption is overcome.\"   Second, the court held that a New Jersey court, applying the newly articulated principles of Gilbert Spruance, would apply the substantive law of Rhode Island to the facts of this case and, therefore, that Rhode Island law, rather than New Jersey law, would govern this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted previously, under normal circumstances we review de novo a district court's choice of the substantive law to apply in a particular case.  In this case, however, an additional consideration guides our review of the district court's choice-of-law decision.

The Grant of Judgment as a Matter of Law</p>\n    <p>1. The Policy Provisions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Northbrook issued a comprehensive liability policy to CPC which was in effect from July 1, 1979 through July 1, 1980.  Pursuant to that policy, Northbrook agreed to indemnify CPC for personal injuries, property damage and/or advertising liability \"caused by or arising out of each Occurrence happening anywhere in the world.\"   The policy defines \"property damage\" as \"loss of or direct damage to or destruction of tangible property (other than property owned by an insured) and which results in an Occurrence during the policy period.\"   The policy defines \"Occurrence\" as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>an accident, event or happening including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which results, during the policy period, in Personal Injury, Property Damage or Advertising Liability neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the Insured</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>....

The District Court Decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ruling upon Northbrook's motion for judgment as a matter of law, the district court made the following pertinent findings of fact.  Between 1963 and the late 1970s, Peterson/Puritan polluted the environment in the area of its plant in Cumberland, Rhode Island.  Peterson/Puritan employees routinely dumped chemicals, including volatile organic compounds (\"VOCs\"), into the drain and septic systems.  In 1974, a railroad tank container at Peterson/Puritan spilled causing approximately 6,200 gallons of the solvent perchloroethylene to spill onto and into the soil (the \"1974 PERC spill\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The theory of the case presented by CPC at trial, primarily through the testimony of two expert witnesses, was that prior to the 1974 PERC spill, the VOCs dumped from Peterson/Puritan were in the soil but, because of the presence of silt and clay, had not reached groundwater.  In other words, they were stagnant.  Dr. Tod Delaney testified that the PERC spill mobilized these VOCs in the soil and led them into the groundwater and, eventually, the combined force travelled a several thousand foot path to the Quinnville Wells.  Dr. Delaney testified that, but for the 1974 PERC spill, there would have been no pollution of the Quinnville Wells.  Dr. Delaney also testified that the leading edge of the 1974 PERC spill reached and contaminated the Quinnville Wells in 1979, during the policy period.  Pollution of the Quinnville Wellfields was discovered in October 1979, during the policy period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its detailed oral opinion granting judgment as a matter of law for Northbrook, the district court reasoned that, because the policy was only in effect from July 1, 1979 to July 1, 1980, the burden at trial was upon CPC to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that there was an \"occurrence\" during that period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court stated that CPC's theory at trial was that because the EPA desires to reopen the Quinnville Wells, and cleaning the aquifer is directly related to that goal, the \"occurrence\" for purposes of insurance should be measured by when the contamination of the wells occurred.  The difficulty with this theory, as the district court explained, is that the Town of Lincoln's claim against Peterson/Puritan to clean up the Quinnville Wells had been settled in 1984 and Northwood had paid the settlement under its insurance policy.  The present action concerns the EPA's claims against CPC regarding the aquifer east of the Blackstone River--the area designated by the EPA as OU-1--not the Quinnville Wells.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court stated that whatever the EPA's motivations concerning reactivating the Quinnville Wells in the future may be, \"the fact of the matter is that the area being remediated is east of the Blackstone River.\"   The court then concluded that the \"occurrence\" in this case took place before the policy became effective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>The plaintiff seeks to recover the costs of remediation of the aquifer east of the Blackstone River from this defendant.  The evidence is clear in this case from the experts presented by the plaintiff, that the aquifer was damaged within the meaning of the policy when it was polluted by the PERC spill in 1974 within days or at best, weeks of June 21, 1974 when this PERC spill took place, five years or more before July 1, 1979 when this policy took effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because it found that the \"occurrence\" took place before the policy came into effect, the district court concluded that, as a matter of law, Northbrook was not obligated to indemnify CPC.  The district court explained that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>If there is a principle of insurance law that means anything it is the principle that insurance protects a policyholder against future contingent events.  It is not for the purpose of providing compensation for events that have already taken place, and that is so under the law of New Jersey, Rhode Island, the First Circuit, or any other jurisdiction within the United States.  So, simply on that ground alone, the occurrence in this case clearly took place before the policy became effective, there can be no recovery of the remediation costs from this insurance carrier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also rejected CPC's case for another reason.  The court, accepting arguendo CPC's theory that remediation of the aquifer is tied in with reopening the Quinnville Wells, concluded that CPC had failed to sustain its burden of showing that damage to the Quinnville Wells took place during the policy period.  Dr. Willard Murray testified that, depending upon the undetermined porosity of the soil, the leading edge of the PERC plume reached the Quinnville Wells between October or November 1978, and December 1981.  Reviewing that testimony, the district court noted that it is \"just as probable that that army of VOC's led by the PERC arrived at the Quinnville Wells in 1978 or early 1979 as it is that it arrived after July 1, 1979.\"   The district court therefore concluded that \"[n]o jury could find that this pollution plume arrived at the Quinnville Wells after July 1, 1979 without completely speculating.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that there is \"no possibility\" that CPC could recover from Northbrook for the costs of remediation of the OU-1 area and, therefore, granted Northbrook's motion.

In fact, there are at least seven trigger dates utilized by different jurisdictions for determining the time at which an occurrence causing property damage takes place.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Moreover, as discussed below, CPC could possibly recover under one or more of these theories.

If the Rhode Island Supreme Court would apply the wrongful act, exposure, or injury-in-fact theories, the district court's decision should be affirmed.  If the Rhode Island Supreme Court would apply the manifestation, first discovery, or \"reasonably knew or should have known\" theories, the case should be remanded to the district court for a new trial.  The reason for this is that, based on the testimony at trial, a reasonable jury could have found that the 1974 PERC spill caused the VOCs to migrate to the Quinnville Wells and that the PERC-led contaminants reached the wells before October 1979.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Under the manifestation theory, a reasonable jury would be entitled to infer, based on CPC's uncontroverted evidence, that the first time CPC should have known of damage to the aquifer was in October 1979, when the contamination of the Quinnville Wells was discovered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  It follows that the same holds true for the first discovery and \"knew or should have known\" theories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was obligated to determine which of these trigger-of-coverage theories the Rhode Island Supreme Court would apply in this case.  Because it did not, we have endeavored to do so here.  In the end, however, we conclude that Rhode Island law is unclear as to which trigger-of-coverage is to be applied and, therefore, choose to certify the question to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CPC argues that Bartholomew, a case from the United States District Court for Rhode Island, purporting to apply Rhode Island law, is the controlling Rhode Island precedent.  Bartholomew holds that the date of the occurrence is the date when the insured \"knew or should have known\" of the property damage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Northbrook, on the other hand, maintains that the Rhode Island Supreme Court's recent decision in Textron, Inc. v. Liberty Mut. Ins.

We agree that Bartholomew and Textron are the most apt cases from Rhode Island on the trigger-of-coverage issue.  Our analysis of the two cases, however, leads us to the conclusion that they raise more questions than they answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court in Bartholomew, finding no Rhode Island law on the subject, predicted that the Rhode Island Supreme Court would adopt the \"reasonably knew or should have known\" trigger-of-coverage standard.  There are several difficulties with this case as an indicator of Rhode Island law.  First, our research indicates that no Rhode Island court has either explicitly adopted or rejected the Bartholomew standard;  in fact, to our knowledge, no Rhode Island court has ever even cited Bartholomew.   Second, our decision affirming the district court in that case did not explicitly comment on the standard adopted by the district court, but rather relied on the more fundamental fact that the \"defects were fully known, indeed sued for, before the policies took effect.\"   Thus, we commented, \"[w]e can only construe the present action as an attempt to 'job' the defendants.\"  Bartholomew v.

Northbrook maintains that this statement indicates that Rhode Island looks to the point when the injury in fact occurs as the trigger date for coverage.

In Textron, an insured sought indemnification for property damage which allegedly occurred during the coverage period but which was not reported until twenty-one years after the last policy's expiration.  The case was disposed of, in favor of the insurer, pursuant to a policy provision which required that the insured report the property damage within one year of the expiration of the policy.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2196990\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Textron,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2196990/textron-inc-v-liberty-mut-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">639</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1363</span></a></span>.

We think this raises questions as to exactly how broad a sweep the Textron court intended its statement to have.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the phrase \"injury-causing event\" could (we think reasonably) be interpreted as either of three potential trigger theories.  It could mean Rhode Island uses the \"wrongful act theory\" in its trigger of coverage analysis, which in this case would be the 1974 PERC spill.  It could mean, as Northbrook argues, that Rhode Island follows the injury-in-fact theory.  Here, according to CPC's own expert witnesses, the injury in fact would have occurred within days of the 1974 PERC spill.  Finally, it could refer to the exposure theory.  In this case, that would have been when the VOCs leeched into the environment--within minutes of the 1974 PERC spill.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Moreover, as the Bartholomew court noted, the wrongful act theory, which we think is the most literal reading of \"injury-causing event,\" \"has been rejected by the vast majority of jurisdictions.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1511936\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Bartholomew,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1511936/bartholomew-v-ins-co-of-north-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We therefore conclude that the most appropriate way to resolve the trigger of coverage issue, consistent both with our duty to apply Rhode Island law and with important principles of federalism, is to certify the question to the Rhode Island Supreme Court pursuant to Rule 6 of the Rhode Island Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's choice-of-law decision is affirmed and a question certified to the Rhode Island Supreme Court, with jurisdiction retained pending that determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CERTIFICATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court hereby certifies a question of Rhode Island state law to the Rhode Island Supreme Court, pursuant to Rule 6 of the Rhode Island Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, and provides a brief statement of the grounds for certification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The insurance policy at issue in CPC Int'l Inc. v.

Section 6 lists several factors to be considered in a choice-of-law analysis:  1) the relevant policies of the forum;  2) the relevant policies of other interested states;  3) the protection of justified expectations;  4) the basic policies underlying the particular field;  5) the needs of the interstate and international systems;  6) certainty, predictability, and uniformity of result;  and 7) the ease in determination and application of the law applied</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> These different legal standards are critical because, as is the case here, most, if not all, \"occurrence\" policy provisions only allow recovery for an occurrence causing property damage during the policy period</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> This appears to be the theory used by the district court in its initial decision, under \"general principles of law,\" that CPC could not recover because injury to the aquifer took place \"when it was polluted by the PERC spill in 1974 within days or at best, weeks of June 21, 1974 when this PERC spill took place ...\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The particular testimony that would support this is:  1) Dr. Delaney's testimony, that, but for the PERC spill, the Quinnville wells would not have been polluted;  2) the testimony that the pollution was discovered in October 1979;  and 3) Dr. Murray's testimony that the leading edge of the PERC plume reached the Quinnville Wells between October or November 1978, and December 1981.  If the jury accepted all these facts as true, which we must do on appeal, it could determine that the PERC-led pollutants, stimulated by the 1974 PERC spill, reached the wells before October 1979</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The district court did not make specific findings as to whether CPC (or Peterson/Puritan) reasonably should have known that the 1974 Perc spill would damage the environment, although the court did note that \"the event was well recognized by the management of Peterson/Puritan.\"   The district court also noted that it is \"unfortunate that people were not environmentally tuned in at that time because, of course, Peterson/Puritan could have made a substantial claim against [the railroad carrier] for polluting the environment.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> CPC actually maintains that Bartholomew establishes a \"manifestation\" trigger of coverage--i.e., there is no \"occurrence\" under the policy until the \"property damage\" becomes known.
