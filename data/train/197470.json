On the night of\r\n\nAugust 17, 1995, defendant-appellant Michael Gignac and two\r\n\nother men robbed a store in Portland, Maine. The robbers all\r\n\nwore masks; two of them were armed. Gignac was indicted on\r\n\nthree counts: Count I alleged that he interfered with commerce\r\n\nby means of robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. S 1951(a),\r\n\nS 1951(b)(1), and 18 U.S.C. S 2. Count II charged Gignac with\r\n\nusing and carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence\r\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. S 924(c)(1), S 924(c)(3), and 18\r\n\nU.S.C. S 2. Count III accused Gignac of possession of a\r\n\nfirearm by a felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. S 922(g),\r\n\nS 924(e)(1), and 18 U.S.C. S 2. The jury found Gignac guilty\r\n\non Count I, but not guilty on Counts II and III. The court\r\n\nsentenced Gignac as a career offender under S 4B1.1 of the\r\n\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines. The court found that\r\n\nGignac was a career offender because of prior convictions for\r\n\narson, burglary of a church, and assault on a prison officer.\r\n\n          Our review is plenary because we are considering\r\n\ninterpretive questions under the Sentencing Guidelines. \r                                                                   United\r\n\nStates  \r                   v.  \r                       Meader, No. 96-2123, slip op. at 11 (1st Cir.\r\n\nJuly 11, 1997); \r                           United States v. Fiore\r                                                 , 983 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1992); United \r                          States \r                                 v. \r                                    St. \r                                        Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1992).\r\n\n          Gignac raises two issues on appeal: (1) Whether the\r\n\ncourt erred in applying the career offender sentence\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nenhancement provision; and (2) Whether the court abused its\r\n\ndiscretion in allowing the prosecutor to impeach defendant with\r\n\nthe number, but not the nature, of his prior convictions.\r\n\n               The Career Offender Enhancement\r\n\n          As a result of Gignac being adjudged a career\r\n\noffender, his adjusted offense level changed from 27 to 32.\r\n\nThe consequent sentencing range increased from 132-160 months\r\n\n(level 27) to 210-262 months (level 32). He was sentenced to\r\n\nthe statutory maximum of 20 years. This contrasts with a\r\n\nmaximum sentence of 13 years plus, without the career offender\r\n\nenhancement.\r\n\n          Section 4B1.1 of the Guidelines defines a career\r\n\noffender as follows:\r\n\n          A defendant is a career offender if (1)\r\n          the defendant was at least eighteen years\r\n          old at the time of the instant offense,\r\n          (2) the instant offense of conviction is a\r\n          felony that is either a crime of violence\r\n          or . . ., and (3) the defendant has at\r\n          least two prior felony convictions of\r\n          either a crime of violence or a controlled\r\n          substance offense.\r\n\nThere is no doubt that Gignac comes within categories (1) and\r\n\n(2) of the career offender guideline provisions. The basis of\r\n\nhis appeal is that he does not come within category (3) because\r\n\nhe does not have two prior felony convictions for crimes of\r\n\nviolence.\r\n\n          Gignac had a number of prior felony convictions. We\r\n\nfocus only on those involving a crime of violence. In 1989\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nGignac was convicted in Maine state court of arson and assault.\r\n\nGignac concedes that this conviction comes within category (3)\r\n\nof the Guidelines. In 1993 Gignac was convicted for assault on\r\n\na corrections officer. He argues that this conviction was not\r\n\na category (3) crime of violence. We disagree.\r\n\n          Section 4B1.2(1) of the Guidelines states:\r\n\n          The term \"crime of violence\" means any\r\n          offense under federal or state law\r\n          punishable by imprisonment for a term\r\n          exceeding one year that --\r\n\n               (i) has as an element the use,\r\n               attempted use, or threatened use\r\n               of physical force against the\r\n               person of another, or . . . .\r\n\n          Under Maine law, assault on a corrections officer is\r\n\na Class C felony. The law states:\r\n\n          1.   A person is guilty of assault on an\r\n          officer if . . . \r\n\n          B.   While in custody in a penal\r\n          institution or other facility pursuant to\r\n          an arrest or pursuant to a court order, he\r\n          commits an assault on a member of the\r\n          staff or facility. As used in this\r\n          paragraph \"assault\" means the crime\r\n          defined in chapter 9, section 207.\r\n\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 11-A, S 752-A. Assault is defined\r\n\nunder S 207(1) of title 17-A as \"A person is guilty of assault\r\n\nif he intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes bodily\r\n\ninjury or offensive physical contact to another.\"\r\n\n          We agree with the district court that an assault on\r\n\na prison guard by its very nature involves a serious potential\r\n\nrisk of injury to another. That is all that is required under\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nS 4B1.2(1)(i) of the Guidelines. Note 2 of the Commentary to\r\n\nS 4B1.2 states that \"crimes of violence\" include offenses where\r\n\n\"that offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or\r\n\nthreatened use of physical force against the person of\r\n\nanother.\" We hold that the assault on the prison officer by\r\n\ndefendant was a crime of violence under the career offender\r\n\nsection (S 4B1.1) of the Guidelines.\r\n\n            Impeachment of Defendant with Number\r\n           But Not Nature of His Prior Convictions\r\n\n          Before we get to the merits of this argument, we must\r\n\nfirst determine whether it was properly preserved for appeal.\r\n\nThe first question is whether defendant's motion in limine to\r\n\nexclude any reference to prior convictions was sufficient alone\r\n\nwithout further objection to warrant consideration by this\r\n\ncourt.\r\n\n          The record discloses the following. A chambers\r\n\nconference was held on the motion \r                                             in \r                                                limine prior to defendant\r\n\ntaking the stand. The question of admissibility of Gignac's\r\n\nprior convictions was discussed in the framework of Fed. R.\r\n\nEvid. 609. At the close of the conference the district court\r\n\ntold the parties that if defendant took the stand, the\r\n\ngovernment would be permitted to establish that there were five\r\n\nprevious felony convictions and the dates, but that the\r\n\ngovernment would not be allowed to show \"the specifics of the\r\n\ncharges on those previous convictions.\" The court ended the \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nconference with the following admonition:\r\n\n             Now counsel, again, remember, that is a\r\n          tentative ruling. It's subject to what\r\n          the defendant says if he takes the stand.\r\n          It may be that he would say something that\r\n          would cause me to reevaluate that ruling\r\n          in terms of allowing some of the specific\r\n          charges or whatever, but based upon what\r\n          you've told me to date, that's my ruling.\r\n\n          Defense counsel did not object to the court's ruling\r\n\nat any time after the conference and before Gignac testified.\r\n\nDefense counsel brought out at the start of direct examination\r\n\nthat Gignac had been convicted of more than one felony. On\r\n\ncross-examination the prosecutor elicited testimony from Gignac\r\n\nthat he had five prior felony convictions between 1988 and\r\n\n1993. There was no objection to this line of questions.\r\n\n          The law in this circuit is clear: a motion \r                                                                in \r                                                                   limine\r\n\nalone is not sufficient to forward the issue for appellate\r\n\nreview. The rule and its rationale have been stated most\r\n\nrecently in Gill v. Thomas, 83 F.3d 537 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\n          We also held in  Gill that if a party introduces\r\n\npotentially impeaching evidence itself in order \"to take the\r\n\nsting\" out of it, this eliminates any potential evidentiary\r\n\nerror by the use of such evidence in cross-examination. \r                                                                   Id. at\r\n\n541.\r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, defendant Gignac has\r\n\nfailed to properly preserve the second issue raised by him. We\r\n\ncannot refrain from noting, however, that even had the issue\r\n\nbeen properly preserved below, it would be of no avail. There\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nis no substantive merit to this claim.

Note 2 of the Commentary to &#167; 4B1.2 states that \"crimes of violence\" include offenses where \"that offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"   We hold that the assault on the prison officer by defendant was a crime of violence under the career offender section (&#167; 4B1.1) of the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Impeachment of Defendant with Number</p>\n    <p>But Not Nature of His Prior Convictions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before we get to the merits of this argument, we must first determine whether it was properly preserved for appeal.

The robbers all wore masks;  two of them were armed.  Gignac was indicted on three counts:  Count I alleged that he interfered with commerce by means of robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a), &#167; 1951(b)(1), and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.  Count II charged Gignac with using and carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1), &#167; 924(c)(3), and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.  Count III accused Gignac of possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g), &#167; 924(e)(1), and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.  The jury found Gignac guilty on Count I, but not guilty on Counts II and III.  The court sentenced Gignac as a career offender under &#167; 4B1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines.  The court found that Gignac was a career offender because of prior convictions for arson, burglary of a church, and assault on a prison officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review is plenary because we are considering interpretive questions under the Sentencing Guidelines.

The consequent sentencing range increased from 132-160 months (level 27) to 210-262 months (level 32).  He was sentenced to the statutory maximum of 20 years.  This contrasts with a maximum sentence of 13 years plus, without the career offender enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 4B1.1 of the Guidelines defines a career offender as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>A defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time of the instant offense, (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or ..., and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no doubt that Gignac comes within categories (1) and (2) of the career offender guideline provisions.  The basis of his appeal is that he does not come within category (3) because he does not have two prior felony convictions for crimes of violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gignac had a number of prior felony convictions.  We focus only on those involving a crime of violence.  In 1989 Gignac was convicted in Maine state court of arson and assault.  Gignac concedes that this conviction comes within category (3) of the Guidelines.  In 1993 Gignac was convicted for assault on a corrections officer.  He argues that this conviction was not a category (3) crime of violence.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Section 4B1.2(1) of the Guidelines states:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>The term \"crime of violence\" means any offense under federal or state law punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Maine law, assault on a corrections officer is a Class C felony.  The law states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>1.  A person is guilty of assault on an officer if ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>B. While in custody in a penal institution or other facility pursuant to an arrest or pursuant to a court order, he commits an assault on a member of the staff or facility.
