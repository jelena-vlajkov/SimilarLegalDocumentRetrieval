Defendant Don  Sandoval appeals  from\r                                \r\n\nthe  sentence the district court imposed on him following the\r\n\nrevocation  of  a term  of  supervised  release.   The  court\r\n\nsentenced defendant to both a term of imprisonment and a term\r\n\nof supervised release.\r\n\n          Defendant first argues  that the supervised release\r\n\nrevocation provision, 18 U.S.C.   3583(e)(3), does not permit\r\n\nthe imposition of a  term of supervised release and a term of\r                                                               \r\n\nimprisonment.   We rejected  this precise argument  in United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates   v.

Defendant has not presented  any persuasive reasons\r\n\nwhy we should change this recent statement of the law.\r\n\n          Defendant's second argument  on appeal is that  the\r\n\ndistrict court violated  the prohibition of the ex post facto\r                                                                         \r\n\nclause by applying   3583(h) to him.   This section was added\r\n\nin  1994.  It specifically provides that when revoking a term\r\n\nof  supervised release  under subsection  (e)(3),  a district\r\n\ncourt may  include a requirement of  supervised release after\r\n\nimprisonment.\r\n\n          To fall  within the ex post  facto prohibition, the\r                                                        \r\n\nnew  law \"must  disadvantage  the offender  affected by  it.\"\r\n\nMiller  v.

Assuming the  district\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ncourt used subsection  (h), defendant was not  disadvantaged.\r\n\nIn  O'Neil, we  already  had construed  subsection (e)(3)  to\r                      \r\n\npermit what subsection (h) now  grants expressly.
