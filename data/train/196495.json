Hamm, III,\r                    SELYA, Circuit  Judge.\r                                         \r\n\nis   currently  serving  two   concurrent,  parole-eligible  life\r\n\nsentences in  a Massachusetts state  penitentiary.   He faces  an\r\n\nadditional twenty-six to forty years in prison from and after the\r\n\nculmination  of  his life  sentences.   Hamm  solicits a  writ of\r\n\nhabeas corpus,  naming as  respondents the superintendent  of the\r\n\nstate   correctional   facility   where  he   is   confined,  the\r\n\nCommissioner  of Correction,  and the  Parole Board  (hereinafter\r\n\ncollectively the respondent or  the Commonwealth), and contending\r\n\nthat  a   policy  implemented  by  the   Commonwealth  after  his\r\n\nincarceration delayed his  eligibility for a parole  hearing.  In\r\n\nhis  estimation,  the  change  in policy  transgressed  both  due\r\n\nprocess and  the ban on ex  post facto laws.   The district court\r\n\nrejected the latter  claim but  granted the writ  on due  process\r\n\ngrounds and ordered, inter alia, a  nunc pro tunc parole hearing.\r                                                           \r\n\n          The petitioner  appeals from both the  dismissal of his\r\n\nex post  facto claim and from  the limited grant of  relief.  The\r\n\nCommonwealth cross-appeals  from the  due process ruling  and the\r\n\nallowance  of  any  relief.    We  hold  that  the Commonwealth's\r                            \r\n\nimplementation  of  the challenged  policy  neither abridged  the\r\n\npetitioner's rights under the Due Process Clause nor violated the\r\n\nEx Post Facto  Clause.   Hence, we reverse  the district  court's\r\n\norder and dismiss the habeas application.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We divide the introductory  section of our opinion into\r\n\nfive segments.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n          A.  The Underlying Convictions and Sentences.\r                    A.  The Underlying Convictions and Sentences.\r                                                                \r\n\n          These  appeals  have  their   genesis  in  events  that\r\n\noccurred  over a quarter-century ago.  In 1969, following a bench\r\n\ntrial,  a  Massachusetts court  found  the  petitioner guilty  of\r\n\ncharges stemming from a brutal  attack and robbery that  occurred\r\n\nthe  previous year.    A more  complete  account of  the  crimes,\r\n\nunnecessary  here,  is available  in  Commonwealth  v. Hamm,  471\r                                                                     \r\n\nN.E.2d 416,  418-19 (Mass. App.  Ct. 1984)  (Hamm I).   The trial\r                                                             \r\n\ncourt  sentenced petitioner  to  two concurrent,  parole-eligible\r\n\nterms of life imprisonment for his convictions on counts of armed\r\n\nrobbery  and  assault with  intent to  rape, and  to a  series of\r\n\nconsecutive sentences  totalling sixty-eight to  eighty years  on\r\n\nthe other counts of conviction (including mayhem and assault with\r\n\nintent to murder).  These consecutive sentences were to be served\r\n\n\"from and after\" the  life sentences.1  The appeals  court, in an\r\n\nunpublished  rescript,  reduced the  from-and-after  sentences to\r\n\ntwenty-six  to  forty  years   but  upheld  the  convictions  and\r\n\nsentences in all other respects.  \r\n\n               B.  The Parole-Eligibility Statute.\r                         B.  The Parole-Eligibility Statute.\r                                                           \r\n\n          The   Massachusetts   statute   governing  the   parole\r\n\neligibility  of  convicts  serving  terms  of  life  imprisonment\r\n\nprovides (and substantially provided in 1968) that:\r\n\n               Every prisoner who is serving a sentence\r\n          for life in a correctional institution of the\r\n          commonwealth  [with specified  exceptions not\r\n          relevant here] shall be eligible  for parole,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Sacrificing  originality for  clarity,  we refer  herein to\r\nthis group of sentences as the \"from-and-after sentences.\"\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          and the parole board shall, within sixty days\r\n          before  the expiration  of  fifteen years  of\r\n          such  sentence,  conduct  a   public  hearing\r\n          before the full membership.\r\n          . . . .\r\n               After such hearing the parole board may,\r\n          by a vote of a majority of its members, grant\r\n          to  such prisoner  a parole  permit to  be at\r\n          liberty upon such terms and conditions as  it\r\n          may prescribe  for the unexpired term  of his\r\n          sentence.  If such permit is not granted, the\r\n          parole  board  shall, at  least once  in each\r\n          ensuing three year period, consider carefully\r\n          and thoroughly the merits of each such case .\r\n          . . .\r\n\nMass.  Gen. L.  ch. 127,    133A.   Until 1977,  the Commonwealth\r\n\nconsidered inmates  who were not only serving  life sentences but\r\n\nalso  facing  the  grim  prospect  of overhanging  from-and-after\r\n\nsentences as coming within the purview of section 133A.  Based on\r\n\nthat interpretation of the statute, the Commonwealth granted such\r\n\ninmates  parole hearings  (for  possible parole  from their  life\r\n\nsentences  into their  from-and-after  sentences)  once they  had\r\n\nserved  close  to fifteen  years.   Accordingly, after  the state\r\n\ncourt sentenced Hamm, correctional officials advised him that the\r\n\nparole-eligibility date referable to  his life sentences would be\r\n\nNovember 28, 1983.2\r\n\n                 C.  The 1977 Aggregation Policy.\r                           C.  The 1977 Aggregation Policy.\r                                                          \r\n\n          In 1977,  the Commonwealth recast its interpretation of\r\n\nsection 133A.   The impetus for  change was  the decision of  the\r\n\nMassachusetts  Supreme  Judicial  Court   (SJC)  in  Henschel  v.\r                                                                       \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The respondent  fixed the  parole-eligibility date in  1969\r\nand informed the  petitioner of it  at that time.   It should  be\r\nnoted,  however, that,  giving  credit for  time served  awaiting\r\ntrial and  sentencing, the Commonwealth  deemed the  petitioner's\r\neffective date of sentence to be November 29, 1968.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nCommissioner  of   Correction,  330  N.E.2d  480   (Mass.  1975).\r                                       \r\n\nHenschel required the aggregation for parole-eligibility purposes\r                  \r\n\nof a prisoner's consecutive county house of correction  and state\r\n\ninstitution  sentences.  See id.  at 483-85.   The SJC advanced a\r                                          \r\n\nthoughtful justification in support of aggregation:\r\n\n          To  follow the  defendant's [non-aggregation]\r\n          approach would require  the board  to make  a\r\n          series  of decisions granting parole from one\r\n          sentence to  the  next rather  than a  single\r\n          decision  on   the   basis  of   one   parole\r\n          eligibility  date for  all  sentences.    The\r\n          former procedure makes little sense since the\r\n          decision to  grant parole  is to be  based on\r\n          whether the board  believes the prisoner  can\r\n          live   freely   outside  of   prison  without\r\n          violating the law.\r\n\nId. at 484.  The Commonwealth found this rationale to be  equally\r             \r\n\nconvincing in the context of making decisions to parole prisoners\r\n\nserving life sentences into overhanging from-and-after sentences.\r\n\nConsequently, it rethought its  earlier interpretation of section\r\n\n133A and  revised its  policies regarding parole  eligibility for\r\n\ncertain classes of inmates,  including lifers who faced impending\r\n\nfrom-and-after  sentences.    Under  the  neoteric  policy,  such\r\n\ninmates were not regarded as falling under section 133A and would\r\n\nno  longer  receive parole  hearings  at  the fifteen-year  mark;\r\n\ninstead,  the parole-ineligible  portion of  the  prisoner's life\r\n\nsentence  (fifteen years)  would be  aggregated with  the parole-\r\n\nineligible portion of his from-and-after sentences to arrive at a\r\n\n\"real\"  parole-eligibility date, that is to say, a single date at\r\n\nwhich a favorable parole decision would  result in the prisoner's\r\n\nactual release from  incarceration, not just his parole  from one\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nsentence into another.3   While this  paradigm was not  compelled\r\n\nby the  holding in Henschel  (which did not  specifically address\r                                     \r\n\nthe aggregation of life sentences with from-and-after sentences),\r\n\nthe   respondent  determined  that   the  new   arrangement  more\r\n\nfaithfully mirrored the tenets undergirding Henschel.\r                                                              \r\n\n          In  1982   the year before Hamm would have received his\r\n\ninitial  section  133A  hearing under  the  former  policy    the\r\n\nCommonwealth applied the  new policy to him and  recalculated his\r\n\nparole-eligibility date.4  The  aggregation resulted in a single,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The document  explaining the new policy,  issued jointly by\r\nthe Department of Correction and the Parole Board, bore the title\r\n\"New Policies  and Practices  Regarding Aggregation of  `From and\r\nAfter'  Sentences (Henschel  Decision).\"  It states  in  relevant\r\npart:\r\n\n          [I]t has become  necessary to revise existing\r\n          procedures and  policies covering aggregation\r\n          of  \"from  and   after\"  (i.e.   consecutive)\r\n          sentences  for  purposes of  computing parole\r\n          eligibility and good conduct deductions.\r\n\n          . . . .\r\n          Life Sentences\r                                  \r\n          Life sentences  on which  there is no  parole\r\n          eligibility  . . .  cannot be aggregated with\r\n          any  other  sentences for  parole eligibility\r\n          purposes.   Life  sentences  which  do  carry\r\n          parole eligibility  . . . will  be aggregated\r                                                  \r\n          with other sentences  for parole  eligibility\r\n          purposes . . . . \r\n\n     4For much of  the life of this litigation,  the Commonwealth\r\nstubbornly insisted that it  aggregated Hamm's sentences pursuant\r\nto  a  different, long-established  policy,  and  that its  newly\r\ncontrived  1977  policy  did  not  effect  any  change  regarding\r\nprisoners such as  Hamm.   Dissatisfied with the  record on  this\r\npoint,  we  retained  appellate  jurisdiction  and  remanded  for\r\nfactfinding.  The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing\r\nand  found, on the basis  of the petitioner's  prison records and\r\ntestimony from  former and current  counsel to the  Parole Board,\r\nthat prior to 1977  the respondent did in fact  follow a practice\r\nof  providing  fifteen-year  parole hearings  to  life  prisoners\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n\"real\" parole-eligibility  date of  November 2001.5   Though this\r\n\nstructural change obviated the need  for the petitioner to obtain\r\n\ntwo parole permits to secure his release in  2001, he claims that\r\n\nit also impermissibly  deprived him of an opportunity for release\r\n\nat an earlier date.\r\n\n          The petitioner's thesis runs along the following lines.\r\n\nMassachusetts law affords  prisoners serving indeterminate  terms\r\n\nof  years various  ways to  reduce their  sentences.   These same\r\n\noptions,  Hamm claims,  are not  available to  prisoners who  are\r\n\nserving life sentences.   Thus, if he  had been paroled  into his\r\n\n(indeterminate)  from-and-after sentences in  1983, he could have\r\n\navailed himself  of these  opportunities and possibly  could have\r\n\ngained his freedom  earlier than  2001.  Under  the 1977  policy,\r\n\nhowever, he effectively remains  on \"life sentence status\" during\r\n\nthe  full term  of  his immurement  and,  therefore, cannot  take\r\n\nadvantage of these early-release opportunities, which include:\r\n\n          (1) Establishing  a \"Wrap-up\" Date.   Once paroled into\r                                                      \r\n\nhis  from-and-after sentences,  the petitioner  would immediately\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nfacing  from-and-after sentences.   The Commonwealth  now accepts\r\nthis  finding  and has  recanted its  assertion  that it  did not\r\nretroactively subject the petitioner to a new policy.\r\n\n     5The exact manner  in which the  respondent arrived at  this\r\ndate is inscrutable.  The  underlying calculation is not revealed\r\nin the court papers  and  Hamm's post-1982 prison  records (which\r\nfrom time to time have indicated various parole-eligibility dates\r\nranging from  1999 to 2001) are  little help.  We  need not probe\r\nthe point too  deeply, however, inasmuch as  the Commonwealth has\r\nnot  disputed  the  petitioner's  contention  that   his  parole-\r\neligibility date under the 1977 aggregation policy is in November\r\nof 2001.  Like the district court,  we will assume that to be the\r\ncorrect date.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nacquire, subject  to divestiture  for misconduct,  statutory good\r\n\ntime  under Mass. Gen. L. ch. 127,   129.  This \"good time\" would\r\n\nbe based on  the top  end of his  indeterminate sentences  (forty\r\n\nyears) and would,  the petitioner claims,  amount to sixteen  and\r\n\none-half years.  He could  earn additional good-time credits  (up\r\n\nto  seven and  one-half  days  per  month)  by  participating  in\r\n\neducational  and  vocational programs.6   See  Mass. Gen.  L. ch.\r                                                       \r\n\n127,    129D.  Moreover, the sentencing court (both initially and\r\n\non  resentencing) gave the petitioner 210 days credit on his four\r\n\nfrom-and-after  sentences for  pre-sentence incarceration.   Hamm\r\n\ntheorizes that this credit applies separately to each of his four\r\n\nfrom-and-after  sentences, yielding  an  aggregate credit  of two\r\n\nyears and four months for jail time.\r\n\n          We  assume arguendo  the accuracy  of  the petitioner's\r                                       \r\n\nfigures without  independently verifying them.7   These potential\r\n\nreductions, totalling twenty-three years and one month, would, if\r\n\ngarnered,  enable him to leave prison without undergoing a second\r\n\nparole hearing after serving just sixteen years and eleven months\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Good-time credits that a convict earns while serving a life\r\nsentence  apparently  do not  reduce  his  life  sentence or  his\r\nparole-ineligible term; we are told that they are simply \"banked\"\r\nand only become useful to him in the event that his life sentence\r\nis  commuted to a  term of years.   Upon parole  into a from-and-\r\nafter  sentence, the  convict would  lose his  \"banked\" good-time\r\ncredits.\r\n\n     7The  record is tenebrous as  to many of  Hamm's claims, and\r\nsome of them,  e.g., the claim  of an entitlement  to an  840-day\r\ncredit    for   pre-sentence   incarceration,    strike   us   as\r\ncounterintuitive.\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\non his  from-and-after sentences.8  Hence, if  the petitioner had\r\n\nbeen  paroled into  his from-and-after  sentences in  November of\r\n\n1983, he might have  established a wrap-up date in  October 2000,\r\n\nthus bringing about his release more than a year earlier than his\r\n\ncurrent aggregated parole-eligibility date.\r\n\n          (2)   Early  Parole.   Once paroled into  his from-and-\r                                       \r\n\nafter  sentences, the  petitioner could  also reduce  the parole-\r\n\nineligibility period  of these  sentences, which  otherwise would\r\n\nremain at seventeen  years and  four months.   First, he  asserts\r\n\nthat he would be  credited automatically with the same  two years\r\n\nand four  months  of jail  time.   But  see  note 7,  supra,  and\r                                                                     \r\n\naccompanying  text.     Second,   his  earned  good   time  would\r\n\neffectively count  as time  served  toward his  parole-ineligible\r\n\nterm.  On this basis, he argues that if he had gained parole from\r\n\nhis life sentences in  1983 and earned section 129D  credits from\r\n\nthen on  at the  maximum rate,  he might  have been  eligible for\r\n\n\"real\" parole as early as November of 1995.9\r\n\n          (3)     Special   Parole.     The  petitioner's   final\r                                            \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8This optimistic calculation assumes,  inter alia, that Hamm\r                                                                \r\nwould  earn section 129D good  time at the  maximum possible rate\r\nover  the  duration of  his  from-and-after sentences.    If Hamm\r\nserves  sixteen years  and  eleven months  of his  from-and-after\r\nsentences on his best behavior, he could theoretically accumulate\r\n1,522.5 days of earned good time.\r\n\n     9The petitioner arrives at this date by taking the following\r\nroute:  208 months (Hamm's statutory parole-ineligible term) less\r\n28  months (pre-sentence  jail credits)  less 36  months (maximum\r\npossible section 129D credits during  first twelve years of from-\r\nand-after sentences) = 144 months.  If Hamm had begun serving his\r\nfrom-and-after sentences  in November of  1983, and if  his other\r\nassumptions proved  true,  he had  a  possibility of  securing  a\r\nparole hearing in November, 1995.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nopportunity-related  theory suggests that aggregation has already\r\n\ndeprived   him   of   the  possibility   of   obtaining   special\r\n\nconsideration parole  as early as  1989, after serving  just one-\r\n\nthird of his from-and-after minimum sentences, less jail credits.\r\n\nSee   Hamm v. Commissioner  of Correction, 564  N.E.2d 1032, 1033\r                                                   \r\n\nn.5  (Mass. App.  Ct.)

The  respondent effectively parries  this thrust,\r\n\nstating that Hamm may apply for this type of parole consideration\r\n\neven under the 1977  aggregation policy.  Finding no  evidence in\r\n\nthe record that  the petitioner has made  an effort to  apply for\r\n\nspecial consideration parole, or that  the Parole Board would not\r\n\nconsider  his request,  we cannot  conclude that  aggregation has\r\n\ndeprived the petitioner of  this benefit.  See  id.  Accordingly,\r                                                             \r\n\nwe do not further discuss this aspect of Hamm's claim of harm.\r\n\n                       D.

A  1990 document\r\n\nprepared   by  the   respondent,  entitled   \"Parole  Eligibility\r\n\nRegulations, Policies, Procedures,\" explains that parole-eligible\r\n\nlife sentences are an exception to the general aggregation policy\r\n\n\"because  of the statutory  requirement that a  parole hearing be\r\n\nheld after a definite  period of time.\"   The about-face did  not\r\n\nameliorate  the petitioner's  professed  plight;  the  respondent\r\n\ndeclined  to  apply this  policy  retroactively  because such  an\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\napplication, it  feared, might  hurt prisoners  approaching their\r\n\naggregated  parole-eligibility  dates.    Thus,   Hamm's  parole-\r\n\neligibility   date   was  not   recalculated,   and   he  remains\r\n\nincarcerated with no parole hearing on the horizon until November\r\n\nof 2001.\r\n\n                   E.

After the\r                                      \r\n\nSJC  denied further  appellate review,  the petitioner  initiated\r\n\nfederal habeas proceedings.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     10The court appeared to misconstrue the petitioner's ex post\r\nfacto argument; rather than focusing on whether the 1977  policy,\r\nas applied,  differed materially  from the  policy  in effect  in\r\n1968, the court  focused on the  1988 policy and ruled  that Hamm\r\nwas not entitled to enjoy its benefits.  On this point, the court\r\nwrote:\r\n\n          The plaintiff's situation does not present an\r\n          ex post facto issue.  The rules have not been\r\n          changed  adversely  to  him.     Rather,  the\r\n          reverse has occurred:  after his offenses and\r\n          sentencing, a rule  has changed  in a  manner\r\n          that, if  applied to  him, would work  to his\r\n          advantage    or  so the  plaintiff  seems  to\r\n          think.\r\n\nHamm II, 564 N.E.2d at 1034-35.\r                 \r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\n          The district  court found that the  Commonwealth had in\r\n\nfact applied a change  in the law to petitioner, but it concluded\r\n\nthat the change  did not harm him and therefore  posed no ex post\r\n\nfacto  problem.  On the due process  claim, the court took a more\r\n\nreceptive stance.  It interpreted section 133A  as mandating that\r\n\npetitioner receive a parole  hearing on his life sentences  after\r\n\nfifteen  years,  and ruled  that  the  Commonwealth's failure  to\r\n\nprovide him  a hearing  in that  time frame  deprived him  of due\r\n\nprocess.   The court ordered the state  to convene such a hearing\r\n\nnunc  pro tunc, and to continue convening such hearings at three-\r                        \r\n\nyear intervals should parole be denied.

ANALYSIS\r\n\n          We  bifurcate  our  analysis,  examining  each  of  the\r\n\npetitioner's constitutional claims under a separate heading.\r\n\n                    A.  The Due Process Claim.\r                              A.  The Due Process Claim.\r                                                       \r\n\n          The district  court found that section  133A applied to\r\n\nthe  petitioner  and afforded  him  a  liberty  interest  in  the\r\n\nconvening of a parole hearing in 1983 (as he neared the  fifteen-\r\n\nyear  mark of his life sentences).   The court based this finding\r\n\non  its  interpretation of  section  133A,  emphasizing that  the\r\n\nstatute  is written in  mandatory and unequivocal  terms   \"Every\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nprisoner who  is serving  a  sentence for  life .  .  . shall  be\r                                                                       \r\n\neligible for  parole, and  the parole  board shall,  within sixty\r                                                            \r\n\ndays before  the expiration of  fifteen years  of such  sentence,\r\n\nconduct a public hearing . . . .\" (emphasis supplied)   and makes\r\n\nno exception on  its face for life prisoners who  also have from-\r\n\nand-after sentences  in prospect.   To  buttress  this view,  the\r\n\ncourt noted that the aggregation policy expressed in section 133A\r\n\ncould not apply to  the petitioner because his life  sentences by\r\n\ndefinition contain no \"minimum\" sentence, and therefore cannot be\r\n\naggregated with his from-and-after sentences  to determine parole\r\n\neligibility.   Building on this  foundation, the court  held that\r\n\nthe  petitioner   had  an  unequivocal  statutory   right  to  be\r\n\nconsidered for  parole into his from-and-after  sentences once he\r\n\nhad  served fifteen  years of  his life  sentences, and  that the\r\n\nCommonwealth  unconstitutionally  deprived  him of  this  liberty\r\n\ninterest  by aggregating  his life  sentences with  his from-and-\r\n\nafter sentences and  by failing  to grant him  an initial  parole\r\n\nhearing in 1983.\r\n\n          We  cannot accept  the lower court's  analysis.   It is\r\n\nsettled  that a  statute  providing for  early  release or  other\r\n\nbenefits under  stipulated conditions  may sometimes confer  upon\r\n\nprison inmates a  liberty interest protected  by the Due  Process\r\n\nClause.11  See Board  of Pardons v.

Those cases  addressed the power  of a state  court\r\n\nretroactively  to correct  an  erroneous sentence  or a  mistaken\r\n\ninterpretation  of state  law.   See  DeWitt,  6 F.3d  at  34-35;\r                                                      \r\n\nLerner,  751 F.2d  at 458-59.   However,  the calculation  of the\r                \r\n\npetitioner's   original   parole-eligibility    date   was    not\r\n\n\"incorrect,\"  so  he arguably  possessed  a  greater interest  in\r\n\nseeing  it  carried  out  than  would  a  prisoner  who  was  the\r\n\nbeneficiary  of   a  botched  calculation.

See\r                                                                           \r\nHenschel, 330 N.E.2d at 484.\r                  \r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nLerner/DeWitt   line  of      cases  does   not  invalidate   the\r                       \r\n\nCommonwealth's actions.  We explain briefly.\r\n\n          Though we  observed in Lerner,  751 F.2d  at 458,  that\r                                                 \r\n\n\"unforeseeable  changes .  .  .  made  after  the  passage  of  a\r\n\nsubstantial  period  of  time  may, in  some  presumably  extreme\r\n\ncircumstances, be fundamentally unfair and hence violative of due\r\n\nprocess even if  designed to correct  an illegal sentence,\"  this\r\n\nobservation is  inapposite here.  In  the first place, we  do not\r\n\nthink  that   the  Massachusetts   Appeals  Court   decision  was\r\n\nunforeseeable;  as stated  above, the statute  was silent  on the\r\n\nprecise situation,  there was no  decisional law directly  on the\r                                          \r\n\npoint, and Henschel adumbrated the result reached in Hamm II.  In\r                                                                      \r\n\nthe second place,  a convict must show special prejudice stemming\r\n\nfrom a changed interpretation.   See DeWitt, 6 F.3d at 35.   This\r                                                     \r\n\nrequisite showing  must consist  of something more  tangible than\r\n\nmerely demonstrating that \"hopes were raised  only to be dashed.\"\r\n\nLerner, 751  F.2d at 459.   Hamm has not  suffered prejudice even\r                \r\n\nremotely approaching  that  sustained by  Lerner,  whose  parole-\r\n\nineligibility period was extended from ten years to twenty  years\r\n\nafter he had (1) undergone two parole hearings, (2) moved  into a\r\n\nminimum-security facility  and accepted other privileges, and (3)\r\n\ntransported his family to another state and caused them to invest\r\n\nin  a business to create  an employment opportunity  for him, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nid.  at 453    to  whom we  denied relief  under the  Due Process\r             \r\n\nClause, see id. at 459.\r                         \r\n\n          In this case, all roads lead to Rome.  We hold that the\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nCommonwealth did  not infract  the petitioner's rights  under the\r\n\nDue Process Clause when it failed to provide him a parole hearing\r\n\nin  1983.   The  administrative scheme  in  force at  that  time,\r\n\napproved  as lawful by a  state appellate court,  did not mandate\r\n\nthat petitioner receive a parole hearing after fifteen years.

The Commonwealth\r\n\ndemurs.  In its view, the 1977  policy is not a \"law\" subject  to\r\n\nthe  ex post facto proscription, and in all events, the resultant\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\naggregation  did  not   increase  the  petitioner's   punishment.\r\n\nBecause we  agree with  the Commonwealth's second  contention, we\r\n\nneed  not decide the thorny  question of whether  the 1977 policy\r\n\ncomprised a \"law\" subject to ex post facto analysis.14\r\n\n          In line  with the  foregoing, we assume  for argument's\r\n\nsake,  but do  not  decide,  that  the  1977  aggregation  policy\r\n\nconstituted a regulation possessing the full  force and effect of\r\n\nlaw, and  that it is therefore  subject to analysis under  the Ex\r\n\nPost Facto Clause.   This  assumption brings us  to the  decisive\r\n\nquestion:   Does the 1977  policy, as applied  to the petitioner,\r\n\ninfringe  the constitutional proscription  against ex  post facto\r\n\nlaws?\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     14We  note in passing  that, although the  Supreme Court has\r\nnot addressed the question of whether an administrative policy or\r\nregulation can be  an ex post facto law, a  number of courts have\r\nheld that binding administrative regulations, as opposed to those\r\nthat serve merely as guidelines for discretionary decisionmaking,\r\nare laws subject to ex post  facto analysis.

In the\r                                            \r\n\nlast analysis, \"the question of what legislative adjustments will\r\n\nbe  held   to  be  of   sufficient  moment   to  transgress   the\r\n\nconstitutional prohibition must be  a matter of degree.\"   Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n1603.\r\n\n          There is  no mechanical  formula for  identifying which\r\n\nlegislative  changes  have  a  sufficiently  profound  impact  on\r\n\nsubstantive  crimes  or punishments  to cross  the constitutional\r\n\nline and which do not.  Consequently, courts must determine, case\r\n\nby  case,  whether  a  particular  change  in  the  governing law\r\n\n\"produces  a  sufficient  risk   of  increasing  the  measure  of\r\n\npunishment attached to  the covered crimes.\"  Id.   If so, the Ex\r                                                           \r\n\nPost Facto Clause comes into play.  See Hill v.  Jackson, 64 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n163, 167-170 (4th Cir. 1995).\r\n\n          Morales  is  the touchstone  of  modern  ex post  facto\r                           \r\n\njurisprudence.  There, the Justices examined a state statute that\r\n\npermitted parole boards to  defer parole suitability hearings for\r\n\n                                22\r\r\n\nup  to  three  years  for  double  murderers  and  certain  other\r\n\nprisoners   if  the   board  specifically   found  that   it  was\r\n\nunreasonable to  expect that parole  would be granted  during the\r\n\nintervening years.   The Court concluded that the statute created\r\n\n\"only  the   most  speculative  and   attenuated  possibility  of\r\n\nproducing  the prohibited  effect  of increasing  the measure  of\r\n\npunishment for covered crimes,\"  and held that these \"conjectural\r\n\neffects\" were insufficient  to animate the Ex Post  Facto Clause.\r\n\nMorales,  115 S.  Ct. at  1603 (footnote  and internal  citations\r                 \r\n\nomitted).\r\n\n          Buttressing  its  conclusion,   the  Court   identified\r\n\nseveral  aspects of  the  statute that  neutralized  the risk  of\r\n\nincreasing the measure of punishment.  First, the statute applied\r\n\nonly to \"a class of prisoners for whom  the likelihood of release\r\n\non parole  is quite remote.\"   Id. at 1603.   Second, the statute\r                                            \r\n\ncabined the parole board's  discretion by requiring it to  make a\r\n\nspecific  finding that a  particular prisoner was  unlikely to be\r\n\nparoled.  See  id.  Third, the statute only  applied to those who\r                            \r\n\nwere  denied  parole  eligibility  the first  time  around,  thus\r\n\nrestricting  the affected class to those least likely to be found\r\n\nsuitable  for parole.    See id.    Finally, though  the  statute\r                                          \r\n\naddressed the frequency of suitability hearings, it empowered the\r\n\nboard to \"tailor the frequency of subsequent suitability hearings\r\n\nto the particular circumstances of the individual prisoner.\"  Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nThe Court also noted  that \"the possibility of  immediate release\r\n\nafter a finding of suitability for parole is largely theoretical;\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\nin  many cases, the prisoner's parole release date comes at least\r\n\nseveral  years  after a  finding  of  suitability,\" and  so  \"the\r\n\npractical effect  of a hearing postponement  is not significant.\"\r\n\nId. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\r             \r\n\n          At bottom, Morales is about  the risk or likelihood  of\r                                      \r\n\nharm:  the Court upheld the California statute largely because it\r\n\nfound the risk of increased punishment posed by the new law to be\r\n\nspeculative and,  at any  rate, to fall  within acceptably  small\r\n\nboundaries.15     Viewed  against  this  backdrop,   Hamm's  case\r\n\nfounders.  Though  the parole scheme in  effect in 1968  may have\r\n\nafforded him the possibility  of terminating his incarceration as\r\n\nearly as 1995 if a series of events materialized, it seems highly\r\n\nunlikely  that these  events  would  have  come  to  pass.    The\r\n\nlikelihood of harm, therefore, is tiny.  And,  moreover, it is at\r\n\nleast   equally  possible   that,  because   of  the   structural\r\n\ndifferences  imposed  by the  two  policies, Hamm  may  well have\r\n\nlanguished in prison longer  under the old scheme than  under the\r\n\nnew.     On  balance,  then,   it  is  virtually   impossible  to\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     15The dissent strongly suggests  that Morales stands for the\r                                                            \r\nbright-line  proposition  that  any  action  which  substantially\r\ndelays,  or  deprives a  prisoner of,  an initial  parole hearing\r\nworks  a per  se violation  of  the Ex  Post Facto  Clause.   The\r                          \r\nMorales Court rejected a  similar argument, emphasizing that such\r                 \r\nan  \"arbitrary line has absolutely  no basis in the Constitution.\r\nIf  a delay in parole hearings  raises ex post facto concerns, it\r                                                              \r\nis because that delay effectively increases a  prisoner's term of\r\nconfinement, and  not because the hearing  itself has independent\r\nconstitutional significance.\"  Morales,  115 S. Ct. at 1603  n.4.\r                                                \r\nThe  dissent's   mechanical  approach   not  only  ignores   this\r\nadmonition but also overlooks Morales's central  holding, namely,\r                                               \r\nthat a proper  ex post facto inquiry must focus  on the risk that\r\nthe   prisoner  will  be  subject  to  an  increased  measure  of\r\npunishment.\r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\nprognosticate the risk that  the petitioner may be released  at a\r\n\nlater date because  the 1977 policy rather  than its predecessor,\r\n\ncontrols in his case.  \r\n\n          Under   the  original  policy,  unless  the  petitioner\r\n\nmanaged to  obtain  parole in  1983  and thereafter  amassed  all\r\n\npossible credits, he would still have to be paroled a second time\r\n\nin order to be released  as early as 1995, or,  alternatively, to\r\n\ngarner every conceivable credit in order to attain a wrap-up date\r\n\nin  October  of 2000.    The record  is  bereft  of any  evidence\r\n\nsuggesting that  Hamm would  probably achieve prompt  parole into\r\n\nhis from-and-after sentences,  become a model prisoner,  go on to\r\n\nearn  all available  credits,  and then  be  paroled out  of,  or\r\n\notherwise released from, his from-and-after sentences at any time\r\n\nbefore  2001.16   In fine,  this case,  like Morales,  involves a\r                                                              \r\n\nsituation  in   which  the   possibility  of  harm   is  entirely\r\n\nspeculative.17\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     16If past is  prologue, cf. W. Shakespeare, The Tempest, act\r                                                                      \r\nII,  sc. i (1612), all of these prospects seem extremely dubious.\r\nHamm's  disciplinary record  reveals a  cavalcade of  misconduct,\r\nincluding episodes of inciting a prison riot, arson, assaulting a\r\nguard,  attempting  an  escape,  conspiring to  take  a  hostage,\r\norganizing a work stoppage, and possessing controlled substances.\r\nThese are not the emblemata of an inmate who is  likely either to\r\ninspire a  parole board  to act  favorably on  his  behalf or  to\r\naccumulate good-time credits at a rapid rate.\r\n\n     17There are, of  course, other similarities to  Morales.  We\r                                                                      \r\nmention two of them.   First, the  challenged policy here    like\r\nthe statute at issue in Morales, 115 S. Ct at 1603   applies only\r                                         \r\nto a limited class  of prisoners (here, life inmates who face the\r\noverhanging prospect  of from-and-after  sentences) for whom  the\r\nlikelihood of release on  parole is considerably below  the norm.\r\nSecond,  the  availability  of  special parole,  see  supra  Part\r                                                                     \r\nI(C)(3), offers the Parole Board the flexibility that the Morales\r                                                                           \r\nCourt deemed important.  See id. at 1604.\r                                          \r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\n          This  case  also  possesses a  further  dimension  that\r\n\nweighs against the petitioner's position.  Whereas the new law in\r\n\nMorales  could  not  conceivably  have  inured  to  a  prisoner's\r                 \r\n\nbenefit, the new aggregation policy that the Commonwealth adopted\r\n\nin  1977 might very  well redound to  the petitioner's advantage.\r\n\nAfter all, the  1977 policy  eliminates the need  for two  parole\r\n\npermits  and  ensures that  the petitioner  will be  eligible for\r\n\nparole from all his sentences  at one fell swoop.  Under  the old\r                         \r\n\npolicy, if the  respondent denied the petitioner  parole into his\r\n\nfrom-and-after  sentences  in  1983,  1986,  and  1989     not an\r\n\nunlikely  eventuality in  light of  Hamm's mottled  record    his\r\n\nwrap-up  date,  even  assuming  the accrual  of  all  conceivable\r\n\ncredits, would not occur until sometime in 2006.  This  is a full\r\n\nfive years after the date  on which he could be paroled  from all\r                          \r\n\nhis sentences under the 1977 policy.\r\n\n          This scenario  prompted the district court  to conclude\r\n\nthat   \"[i]n   1982,  when   the   respondent   recalculated  the\r\n\npetitioner's  parole eligibility,  it was  not clear  whether the\r\n\npetitioner would be helped or harmed by aggregation; the  balance\r\n\nsheet  is  unclear even  today.\"   Hamm  III,  slip op.  at 10.18\r                                                      \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     18The Morales  Court pointed  out that the  relevant inquiry\r                            \r\nmust not  focus \"on  whether a  legislative change produces  some\r\nambiguous  sort of `disadvantage,' . .  . but on whether any such\r\nchange  .  .  .  increases  the  penalty  by  which  a  crime  is\r\npunishable.\"  Morales, 115 S. Ct. at 1602 n.3.   Despite the fact\r                               \r\nthat the district court issued its opinion without the benefit of\r\nMorales and framed  the corresponding  part of its  ruling as  an\r                 \r\ninquiry   into   whether   the   1977  policy   resulted   in   a\r\n\"[d]isadvantage  to  the  petitioner,\"   it  nonetheless  made  a\r\nthoroughgoing   examination  of   the  uncertainty   inherent  in\r\ncomparing potential results under the old and new policies. \r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\nThis statement  is unarguably accurate, and  the uncertainty that\r\n\nit  portends   strips  the   veneer  of  plausibility   from  the\r\n\npetitioner's ex post facto initiative.  Morales makes  it crystal\r                                                         \r\n\nclear that  such  uncertainty militates  against  the  petitioner\r\n\nbecause  any other  approach  would \"effectively  shift[] to  the\r\n\nState the burden  of persuasion  as to [the  prisoner's] ex  post\r\n\nfacto claim.\"   Id. at 1603 n.6.  A  party who asserts an ex post\r                             \r\n\nfacto  claim must show a real possibility of cognizable harm, not\r\n\na  theoretical  possibility  bound  up  in  gossamer  strands  of\r\n\nspeculation and surmise.\r\n\n          We find illuminating a recent decision of another court\r\n\nthat needed to construct the ex post facto balance of prospective\r\n\nbenefits and burdens.   In United States v.  McGee, 60 F.3d  1266\r                                                            \r\n\n(7th Cir. 1995), the court addressed an amendment that became law\r\n\nfollowing the defendant's conviction but before the imposition of\r\n\nsentence.    The  amendment  eliminated  a  twelve-month  minimum\r\n\nsentence for the  offense of  conviction and replaced  it with  a\r\n\nrange of  twenty-one to twenty-four  months.  The  district court\r\n\nimposed the  maximum twenty-four-month sentence.   The  defendant\r\n\nappealed, claiming that the amendment  violated the ex post facto\r\n\nprohibition  because  it removed  the  possibility  of a  shorter\r\n\nsentence,  i.e.,  a sentence  of  between  twelve and  twenty-one\r\n\nmonths.   The Seventh Circuit disagreed.  It noted that, although\r\n\nthe amendment eliminated an opportunity for a milder sentence, it\r\n\nalso placed a  ceiling on  the maximum  available sentence,  thus\r\n\nnarrowing \"the range of punishment to [the defendant's] benefit.\"\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\nId.  at 1271.  This potential benefit  made an evaluation  of the\r             \r\n\nrisk  that  the new  law might  subject  the prisoner  to harsher\r\n\npunishment  too  speculative  to  constitute  an  ex  post  facto\r\n\nviolation.  See id.\r                             \r\n\n          The Seventh  Circuit's  rationale is  persuasive  here.\r\n\nDue to  the peculiar concatenation of  circumstances   especially\r\n\nthe profound uncertainty over how the petitioner would have fared\r\n\nunder the old system  and the potential benefits that  may accrue\r\n\nto  him under  the  new  regime    the  potential  risk  of  more\r\n\nDraconian  punishment  under  the  1977  policy  defies  reliable\r\n\nmeasurement.  As  a result, we hold  that the application of  the\r\n\nnew  policy to the  petitioner did not  insult the Ex  Post Facto\r\n\nClause.\r\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\r          III.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go no  further.  For the foregoing  reasons, we\r\n\nreverse the  district court's  order and dismiss  the application\r\n\nfor a writ of habeas corpus.\r\n\nIt is so ordered.\r          It is so ordered.\r                          \r\n\n                 Separate Opinion Follows\r\n\n            STAHL, Circuit Judge (concurring in part and\r                      STAHL, Circuit Judge (concurring in part and\r                                          \r\n\n  dissenting in part).

Unlike my\r\n\n                                28\r\r\n\n  colleagues, however, I am persuaded that, as applied to Hamm\r\n\n  and other similarly-situated prisoners, the 1977 aggregation\r\n\n  policy is an unconstitutional ex post facto law.  First, I\r\n\n  believe that the 1977 aggregation policy, which effectively\r\n\n  altered the date of Hamm's initial parole hearing, is a \"law\"\r\n\n  subject to ex post facto limitations.  Second, contrary to my\r\n\n  colleagues, I believe that the 1977 policy, as applied to\r\n\n  Hamm and other similarly-situated prisoners, clearly produces\r\n\n  a risk of increasing the measure of punishment sufficient to\r\n\n  violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.  Hence, I respectfully\r\n\n  dissent from parts II.B.-III.\r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n            Article 1,   10 of the Constitution clearly\r\n\n  proscribes the authority of a state to enact any ex post\r\n\n  facto law.  As the majority explains, it is long settled that\r\n\n  the Clause forbids \r\n\n            any statute which punishes as a crime an\r\n            act previously committed, which was\r\n            innocent when done; which makes more\r\n            burdensome the punishment for a crime,\r\n            after its commission, or which deprives\r\n            one charged with crime of any defense\r\n            available according to law at the time\r\n            when the act was committed.\r\n\n  Collins v.

In general, an\r\n\n  ex post facto inquiry requires a two-step analysis.  See\r                                                                    \r\n\n  Miller v. Florida, 482 U.S. 423, 430 (1987).  A court should\r                             \r\n\n  ask (1) whether the challenged provision is a \"law\" that acts\r\n\n  retrospectively, and (2) whether the burden the law\r\n\n  retrospectively imposes is of sufficient type and degree to\r\n\n  violate the Constitution. \r\n\n            In this case, Hamm argues that the 1977 aggregation\r\n\n  policy violated the Ex Post Facto Clause by retroactively\r\n\n  depriving him of opportunities to obtain his release earlier\r\n\n  than November 2001.  In response, the Commonwealth contends\r\n\n  that the 1977 aggregation policy was not a \"law\" subject to\r\n\n  ex post facto limitation, and that, in any event, the\r\n\n  aggregation did not increase Hamm's punishment.  My\r\n\n  colleagues agree with the second contention, and therefore\r\n\n  find it unnecessary to consider the first.  Because, as I\r\n\n  explain more fully infra at 35-43, I believe that the 1977\r                                    \r\n\n  aggregation policy engendered a sufficient risk of increasing\r\n\n  Hamm's punishment, I cannot avoid the first prong of the\r\n\n  Commonwealth's argument.  Accordingly, I proceed first to\r\n\n  explore fully whether the 1977 aggregation policy is a \"law\"\r\n\n  subject to ex post facto proscription, and, second, to\r\n\n  discuss my disagreement with the majority over whether the\r\n\n                               -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\n  new policy produces a risk of increasing the measure of\r\n\n  punishment sufficient to violate the Constitution.19\r\n\n  A.  Is the 1977 Aggregation Policy a \"Law\"?\r                                                       \r\n\n            I agree with the district court that the 1977\r\n\n  aggregation policy was a \"law\" for purposes of ex post facto\r\n\n  analysis.  Although the aggregation policy was not formally\r\n\n  promulgated as a regulation governing the Parole Board, it\r\n\n  was as binding on the Parole Board, on a case-by-case basis,\r\n\n  as an act passed by the legislature would have been. \r\n\n  Moreover, the Commonwealth does not argue that, once the\r\n\n  policy had been promulgated, the Parole Board had any\r\n\n  discretion to deviate from the policy in any particular\r\n\n  instance.\r\n\n            The Supreme Court has not addressed the question of\r\n\n  whether an administrative policy or regulation can be an ex\r\n\n  post facto law.  A number of circuit courts, however, have\r\n\n  held that binding administrative regulations, as opposed to\r\n\n  those that serve merely as guidelines for discretionary\r\n\n  decisionmaking, are laws subject to ex post facto limitation. \r\n\n  For example, in a case factually similar to this one, the\r\n\n  Ninth Circuit held that the California Department of\r\n\n  Corrections's recalculation of a prisoner's parole-\r\n\n  eligibility date under its new interpretation of the\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  19.  I  do  not  restate  the  facts  or  outline  the  prior\r\n  proceedings.

The Commonwealth makes no claim that its\r\n\n                               -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\n  aggregation policy was merely \"advisory\" or that it was free\r\n\n  to disregard the policy in a particular case.\r\n\n            The Commonwealth does postulate, however, that\r\n\n  because it had discretion to adopt the 1977 aggregation\r\n\n  policy in the first place and to modify the policy\r\n\n  subsequently, as it did in 1988, the policy should not be\r\n\n  considered a law.  Although a number of the federal Parole\r\n\n  Commission cases have relied in part on this reasoning,20\r\n\n  see, e.g., Smith, 875 F.2d at 1367, I would reject it here. \r                            \r\n\n  The argument not only exalts form over substance but its\r\n\n  logic suggests that even legislative acts, because they too\r\n\n  may be modified, should be immune to challenge under the Ex\r\n\n  Post Facto Clause.  See Bailey, 940 F.2d at 1158 (Lay, C.J.,\r                                          \r\n\n  dissenting).  A binding policy or regulation, promulgated\r\n\n  pursuant to delegated legislative authority by an\r\n\n  administrative body that implicitly retains authority to\r\n\n  amend it in the future, is no different in its force and\r\n\n  effect than a law passed by a legislature that retains\r\n\n  authority to amend or revoke that law.  The Commonwealth's\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  20.  The Commonwealth claims that the Eighth  Circuit adopted\r\n  this  reasoning  in Bailey,  which  held  that  a  change  in\r                                      \r\n  Minnesota parole  board regulations abolishing  annual review\r\n  of  prospective  release  dates   and  limiting  the  board's\r\n  discretion in changing  such dates did  not constitute a  law\r\n  for ex  post facto  purposes, even  though  the board  lacked\r\n  discretion to  disregard its  regulations in any  given case.\r\n  However, the relevant  section of Bailey,  940 F.2d at  1156,\r                                                    \r\n  drew  the  concurrence of  a second  panel  member as  to the\r\n  result  only, and not its reasoning, id. at 1157 (Stuart, J.,\r                                                    \r\n  concurring).\r\n\n                               -34-\r                                          34\r\r\n\n  Parole Board possessed delegated legislative authority to\r\n\n  promulgate the aggregation policy:  \"The parole board shall .\r\n\n  . . make rules relative to the performance of its duties.\" \r\n\n  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 27,   5(e).  Furthermore, under\r\n\n  Massachusetts law, an agency regulation21 \"promulgated\r\n\n  pursuant to a legislative grant of power generally [has] the\r\n\n  force of law.\"  Kenney v. Commissioner of Correction, 468\r                                                                \r\n\n  N.E.2d 616, 619 (Mass. 1984).  Thus, because the 1977\r\n\n  aggregation policy was effectively a regulation having the\r\n\n  full force and effect of law, I would hold that it is subject\r\n\n  to limitation under the Ex Post Facto Clause.\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  21.  That  the   1977  policy  was  not   formally  deemed  a\r\n  \"regulation\"   also   does   not   seem   to  matter:   Under\r\n  Massachusetts law, a \"regulation\"\r\n\n            includes the  whole or any part  of every\r                                                               \r\n            rule,   regulation,  standard   or  other\r                                                               \r\n            requirement  of  general application  and\r                                                               \r\n            future effect . .  . adopted by an agency\r                                   \r\n            to   implement   or  interpret   the  law\r\n            enforced or administered by it.\r\n\n  Mass.

Does the 1977 Aggregation Policy Produce a Sufficient\r                                                                     \r\n\n  Risk of Increasing the Measure of Punishment?\r                                                         \r\n\n            I now turn to the issue at the heart of my\r\n\n  disagreement with the majority:  Whether, as applied to Hamm\r\n\n  and other similarly-situated prisoners, the 1977 aggregation\r\n\n  policy produces a risk of increased punishment sufficient to\r\n\n  violate the Ex Post Facto Clause?  My colleagues answer this\r\n\n  question in the negative, basing their conclusion on two\r\n\n  premises.  First they deem it highly unlikely that, under the\r\n\n  prior policy, Hamm would have won early parole from his life\r\n\n  sentence and acquired the necessary good-time credits to\r\n\n  advance the date of his ultimate parole hearing to a point\r\n\n  earlier than 2001.  Hence, they conclude that any harm to\r\n\n  Hamm ensuing from the 1977 aggregation policy is highly\r\n\n  speculative.  Second, they posit that, due to structural\r\n\n  differences between the two policies, a \"real\" benefit\r\n\n  accrues to Hamm under the new policy.  Then, combining these\r\n\n  two premises, my colleagues ultimately conclude that, on\r\n\n  balance, the 1977 aggregation policy does not violate the Ex\r\n\n  Post Facto Clause.  I strongly disagree.\r\n\n            My colleagues favorably compare the risk of\r\n\n  increased punishment occasioned by the 1977 aggregation\r\n\n  policy with the risk of increased punishment recently\r\n\n  examined by the Supreme Court in California Dep't of\r                                                                \r\n\n  Corrections v. Morales, 115 S. Ct. 1597 (1995).  In Morales,\r                                                                       \r\n\n                               -36-\r                                          36\r\r\n\n  the Court considered an amendment permitting the California\r\n\n  state parole board to defer annual parole-suitability\r\n\n  hearings for up to three years for prisoners at least twice\r\n\n  convicted of murder.  Id. at 1600.  In upholding the\r                                     \r\n\n  amendment, the Court rejected the contention that it violated\r\n\n  the Ex Post Facto Clause simply because the deferral of\r\n\n  subsequent suitability hearings deprived affected prisoners\r\n\n  of an opportunity to gain an earlier release from prison. \r\n\n  Id. at 1602 n.3.  The Court explained that just because the\r               \r\n\n  amendment caused the loss of some theoretical opportunity to\r\n\n  gain an earlier release did not mean that it necessarily\r\n\n  violates the Constitution.  Id.  Instead, the Court held\r                                           \r\n\n  that, for ex post facto purposes, the test is whether the\r\n\n  loss of that opportunity actually produces a \"sufficient risk\r\n\n  of increasing the measure of punishment for the attached\r\n\n  crimes.\"  Id. at 1603.  \r                         \r\n\n            In applying this test, the Court focused on several\r\n\n  factors that significantly minimized the California\r\n\n  amendment's risk of harm.  Morales, 115 S. Ct. at 1603-05. \r                                              \r\n\n  First, the Court noted the amendment's limited application. \r\n\n  Id. at 1603.  The amendment had no effect on any prisoner\r               \r\n\n  unless the California parole board first found that the\r\n\n  prisoner was both unsuitable for parole and unlikely to be\r\n\n  found suitable at subsequent hearings during the deferral\r\n\n  period.  Id. at 1604.  Moreover, the Court noted that the\r                        \r\n\n                               -37-\r                                          37\r\r\n\n  amendment did not affect \"the date of any prisoner's initial\r\n\n  parole suitability hearing:  it affected the timing only of\r\n\n  subsequent hearings.\"  Id. at 1605.\r                                      \r\n\n            Next, the Court observed, inter alia, that, even\r                                                          \r\n\n  with respect to a prisoner who might have actually received a\r\n\n  favorable recommendation at an omitted hearing, the practical\r\n\n  effect of the amendment on that prisoner's ultimate release\r\n\n  date was only slight.  Morales, 115 S. Ct. 1605.  At the\r                                          \r\n\n  deferred hearings, the parole board determined only a\r\n\n  prisoner's \"suitability\" for parole but did not set actual\r\n\n  parole dates.  Id.  The Court noted that, significantly, in\r                              \r\n\n  many cases, an actual parole date comes several years after a\r\n\n  finding of suitability.  Id.  Moreover, under California law,\r                                        \r\n\n  evidence that a prisoner in fact had been \"suitable\" for a\r\n\n  year or two prior to the date of the prisoner's delayed\r\n\n  hearing would be relevant in setting the prisoner's actual\r\n\n  parole date.  Id.  Hence, the Court concluded that, in most\r                             \r\n\n  cases, any delay resulting from the amendment could be\r\n\n  corrected by the parole board when it set the prisoner's\r\n\n  ultimate release date.  Id.\r                                       \r\n\n              In short, the Court recognized that the\r\n\n  amendment's built-in limitations, severely restricting both\r\n\n  its application and potential effect, effectively minimized\r\n\n  any risk of increased punishment caused by the elimination of\r\n\n  subsequent suitability hearings.  Furthermore, the Court\r\n\n                               -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\n  carefully limited the breadth of its holding, expressly\r\n\n  disavowing any opinion \"as to the constitutionality of any of\r\n\n  a number of statutes that might alter the timing of parole\r\n\n  hearings under circumstances different from those present\r\n\n  here.\"  Morales, 115 S. Ct. at 1603 n.6.  \r                           \r\n\n            On close analysis, I believe the effect of the 1977\r\n\n  aggregation policy challenged here differs significantly from\r\n\n  the risk of increased harm produced by the Morales amendment. \r                                                              \r\n\n  First, in contrast to the Morales amendment, the adoption of\r                                             \r\n\n  the 1977 aggregation policy potentially affects all\r\n\n  Massachusetts prisoners previously eligible for parole from a\r\n\n  life sentence into consecutive from-and-after sentences.  No\r\n\n  provision in the policy limits the class of affected\r\n\n  prisoners to only those adjudged by the Commonwealth's Parole\r\n\n  Board (or some similar body) to be unlikely to win early\r\n\n  parole or to earn significant good-time credits.  Moreover,\r\n\n  where the Morales amendment affected only subsequent\r                             \r\n\n  hearings, the 1977 aggregation policy essentially delays an\r\n\n  affected prisoner's initial parole hearing.\r\n\n            Second, also in contrast to Morales, the impact of\r                                                         \r\n\n  the 1977 aggregation policy on those it affects is\r\n\n  substantial.  For example, under the prior policy, Hamm could\r\n\n  have terminated his incarceration as early as 1995, through\r\n\n  the acquisition of earned and statutory good-time credits and\r\n\n                               -39-\r                                          39\r\r\n\n  the application of his jail credits.22  The 1977\r\n\n  aggregation policy extinguished that possibility; Hamm's term\r\n\n  of incarceration cannot end under the 1977 policy before his\r\n\n  first-available parole hearing in 2001.  Thus, in contrast to\r\n\n  the amendment in Morales, which will have little, if any,\r                                    \r\n\n  real impact on an affected prisoner's actual time in prison,\r\n\n  the 1977 aggregation policy could potentially increase Hamm's\r\n\n  prison term by up to six years.  See Weaver v. Graham, 450\r                                                                 \r\n\n  U.S. 24, 26-27, 31-34 (1981) (holding that new state statute\r\n\n  reducing amount of good time that could be earned\r\n\n  prospectively by current inmates violates Ex Post Facto\r\n\n  Clause because it removed existing opportunity for shortened\r\n\n  prison time).\r\n\n            My colleagues gloss over these clear distinctions\r\n\n  by positing that, whatever the risk might have been at the\r\n\n  outset, given the brutal nature of Hamm's crime and his poor\r\n\n  record as a prisoner, it is highly unlikely that Hamm could\r\n\n  have availed himself of the opportunity to obtain an earlier\r\n\n  release.  Such analysis, however, is more akin to a harmless\r\n\n  error inquiry focusing on the particulars of Hamm's case than\r\n\n  to a proper ex post facto inquiry into whether the new law\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  22.  As does the  majority, I assume  the accuracy of  Hamm's\r\n  claim  of  entitlement  to 840  days  of  jail  credit.   See\r                                                                         \r\n  Majority  at 8.    I note,  however, that  the  claim is  not\r                    \r\n  critical to my analysis.  Even without the 840 days, the 1977\r\n  aggregation  policy  deprives  Hamm  of  the  opportunity  to\r\n  advance  his initial ultimate  parole date by  over three and\r\n  half years.\r\n\n                               -40-\r                                          40\r\r\n\n  posed a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of\r\n\n  punishment.  Moreover, while it is clear that Hamm bears the\r\n\n  ultimate burden of establishing that the new law changes the\r\n\n  measure of punishment, Morales, 115 at 1603 n.6, this does\r                                          \r\n\n  not mean that he must necessarily show \"that he would have\r\n\n  been sentenced to a lesser term under the measure or range of\r\n\n  punishments in place under the previous statutory scheme.\" \r\n\n  Id. (citing Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U.S. 397, 401 (1937));\r                                             \r\n\n  see also id. at 1607 (Stevens, Souter, J.J., dissenting);\r                        \r\n\n  Miller v. Florida, 482 U.S. 423, 432 (1987) (reaffirming\r                             \r\n\n  Lindsey).  Indeed, the proper \"inquiry looks to the\r                   \r\n\n  challenged provision, and not to any special circumstances\r\n\n  that may mitigate its effect on the particular individual.\" \r\n\n  Weaver, 450 U.S. at 33.\r                  \r\n\n            In any event, the fact of the matter is that the\r\n\n  1977 aggregation policy completely deprived Hamm of his once-\r\n\n  existing opportunity to gain a release from prison as much as\r\n\n  six years earlier than he can now.  Moreover, notwithstanding\r\n\n  my colleagues' post hoc evaluation of Hamm's chances, because\r                                   \r\n\n  Hamm never received a parole hearing, no findings exist to\r\n\n  inform us whether or not the Commonwealth would have found\r\n\n  Hamm to be a likely candidate for early parole from his life\r\n\n  sentence.  Indeed, without such findings or even knowledge\r\n\n  concerning the standards and policies that guide the\r\n\n  Commonwealth's Parole Board in making such recommendations,\r\n\n                               -41-\r                                          41\r\r\n\n  this court can only speculate as to whether the 1977\r                      \r\n\n  aggregation policy posed a sufficient risk to Hamm.23\r\n\n            In Morales, the Court reasoned that the delay in\r                                \r\n\n  parole suitability hearings caused by the challenged\r\n\n  amendment did not produce a sufficient risk of punishment\r\n\n  because, in major part, the amendment affected only a\r\n\n  carefully limited class of prisoners, and the impact of any\r\n\n  delay on an affected prisoner's actual time in prison was\r\n\n  negligible.  Implicit in the Court's holding, however, is the\r\n\n  recognition that delay in a parole hearing produces some\r                                                                    \r\n\n  possibility of an increase in punishment.  Where, as here,\r\n\n  the delay is not predicated on a finding that the prisoner is\r\n\n  an unlikely candidate for parole, and the delay may\r\n\n  significantly increase the prisoner's sentence, I believe,\r\n\n  even in Hamm's case, such delay produces a \"sufficient risk\r\n\n  of increasing the measure of punishment.\"  Morales, 115 at\r                                                              \r\n\n  1603.\r\n\n            As noted, my colleagues also base their conclusion\r\n\n  on the premise that the 1977 aggregation policy arguably\r\n\n  provides a \"real\" benefit to Hamm and other affected\r\n\n  prisoners.  I believe, however, that it is this putative\r\n\n  \"benefit\" that is too \"speculative\" to merit significant\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  23.  The fact  that the record  lacks the opinion,  much less\r\n  the findings,  of the  Commonwealth's Parole Board  on Hamm's\r\n  suitability   for  early   parole  clearly   underscores  the\r\n  inappropriateness  of my  colleagues' \"harmless  error\" style\r\n  review.   \r\n\n                               -42-\r                                          42\r\r\n\n  weight in the ex post facto inquiry.  Any fair analysis\r\n\n  reveals that the supposed benefit arising from the 1977\r\n\n  aggregation policy assumes several rather contradictory\r\n\n  predicates.  For example, to find that Hamm would benefit\r\n\n  from the 1977 policy, I would need to assume both (1) that,\r\n\n  under the prior policy, the Commonwealth's Parole Board would\r\n\n  have refused to grant Hamm parole from his life sentence at\r\n\n  least three times (in 1983, 1986, and 1989), or that, if the\r\n\n  board did grant him such initial parole, he would have\r\n\n  subsequently failed to accrue good-time credits, and (2)\r                                                                \r\n\n  that, under the new policy, the Parole Board would then grant\r\n\n  him \"real\" parole into society at large in 2001\r\n\n  (notwithstanding that the board would not even have granted\r\n\n  Hamm parole from his life sentence into his lengthy from-and-\r\n\n  after sentences on at least three prior occasions).  In other\r\n\n  words, the Parole Board would have to deny Hamm's request for\r\n\n  parole from one lengthy sentence into another at least three\r\n\n  times, but then, a short time later, be willing essentially\r\n\n  to grant Hamm a complete release from prison.  The inherent\r\n\n  contradiction in such assumptions discloses the difficulty of\r\n\n  quantifying such a \"benefit,\" or even determining whether one\r\n\n  genuinely exists.  Thus, I believe that any benefit\r\n\n  engendered by the 1977 aggregation policy is much too\r\n\n                               -43-\r                                          43\r\r\n\n  speculative to serve as an effective counterweight to its\r\n\n  real risk of harm.24\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n            In sum, I believe that the 1977 aggregation policy\r\n\n  is a \"law\" subject to ex post facto limitation, and that the\r\n\n  policy produces a risk of increasing the measure of\r\n\n  punishment sufficient to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of\r\n\n  the Constitution.  Accordingly, I dissent from parts II.B.-\r\n\n  III.\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  24.  My  colleagues  find  further  support  in  the  Seventh\r\n  Circuit's  recent decision in United States v. McGee, 60 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n  1266,  1271 (7th Cir. 1995).   In McGee,  the Seventh Circuit\r                                                   \r\n  rejected an ex post facto challenge to a sentencing provision\r\n  that  substituted a  mandatory range  of 21  to 24  months in\r\n  place of  an open-ended  12  month minimum  sentence for  the\r\n  offense  of conviction.  Id. I find the analogy inapt because\r                                        \r\n  in  McGee  the  district  court had  actually  sentenced  the\r                     \r\n  defendant to the maximum  24 months under the  new sentencing\r\n  range  prior to  the  Seventh Circuit's  review.   Thus,  the\r\n  Seventh  Court could fairly quantify both the benefit and the\r\n  harm produced  by the  new sentencing range.   Significantly,\r\n  the fact that the district  court had sentenced the defendant\r\n  to  the  maximum possible  under  the  new sentencing  scheme\r\n  clearly suggested that, if anything, it would have given  the\r\n  defendant  a  higher,  not  lesser, sentence  under  the  old\r\n  scheme.   In our  case, however,  Hamm received  no analogous\r\n  treatment.   He received no parole hearing.  Thus, instead of\r\n  fairly  quantifying the risk as  the McGee court  did, we can\r                                                      \r\n  only speculate as  to the effect the 1977  aggregation policy\r\n  will ultimately have on his sentence.\r\n\n                               -44-\r                                          44\r\r\n",

A more complete account of the crimes, unnecessary here, is available in Commonwealth v. Hamm, 19 Mass.App. 72, 471 N.E.2d 416, 418-19 (1984) (Hamm I ).   The trial court sentenced petitioner to two concurrent, parole-eligible terms of life imprisonment for his convictions on counts of armed robbery and assault with intent to rape, and to a series of consecutive sentences totalling sixty-eight to eighty years on the other counts of conviction (including mayhem and assault with intent to murder).  These consecutive sentences were to be served \"from and after\" the life sentences.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The appeals court, in an unpublished rescript, reduced the from-and-after sentences to twenty-six to forty years but upheld the convictions and sentences in all other respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>B.

Until 1977, the Commonwealth considered inmates who were not only serving life sentences but also facing the grim prospect of overhanging from-and-after sentences as coming within the purview of section 133A.  Based on that interpretation of the statute, the Commonwealth granted such inmates parole hearings (for possible parole from their life sentences into their from-and-after sentences) once they had served close to fifteen years.  Accordingly, after the state court sentenced Hamm, correctional officials advised him that the parole-eligibility date referable to his life sentences would be November 28, 1983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>C.

The impetus for change was the decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) in Henschel v. Commissioner of Correction, 368 Mass. 130, 330 N.E.2d 480 (Mass.1975).  Henschel required the aggregation for parole-eligibility purposes of a prisoner's consecutive county house of correction and state institution sentences.  See id. 330 N.E.2d at 483-85.   The SJC advanced a thoughtful justification in support of aggregation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>To follow the defendant's [non-aggregation] approach would require the board to make a series of decisions granting parole from one sentence to the next rather than a single decision on the basis of one parole eligibility date for all sentences.  The former procedure makes little sense since the decision to grant parole is to be based on whether the board believes the prisoner can live freely outside of prison without violating the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. 330 N.E.2d at 484.   The Commonwealth found this rationale to be equally convincing in the context of making decisions to parole prisoners serving life sentences into overhanging from-and-after sentences.  Consequently, it rethought its earlier interpretation of section 133A and revised its policies regarding parole eligibility for certain classes of inmates, including lifers who faced impending from-and-after sentences.  Under the neoteric policy, such inmates were not regarded as falling under section 133A and would no longer receive parole hearings at the fifteen-year mark;  instead, the parole-ineligible portion of the prisoner's life sentence (fifteen years) would be aggregated with the parole-ineligible portion of his from-and-after sentences to arrive at a \"real\" parole-eligibility date, that is to say, a single date at which a favorable parole decision would result in the prisoner's actual release from incarceration, not just his parole from one sentence into another.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  While this paradigm was not compelled by the holding in Henschel (which did not specifically address the aggregation of life sentences with from-and-after sentences), the respondent determined that the new arrangement more faithfully mirrored the tenets undergirding Henschel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1982--the year before Hamm would have received his initial section 133A hearing under the former policy--the Commonwealth applied the new policy to him and recalculated his parole-eligibility date.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The aggregation resulted in a single, \"real\" parole-eligibility date of November 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Though this structural change obviated the need for the petitioner to obtain two parole permits to secure his release in 2001, he claims that it also impermissibly deprived him of an opportunity for release at an earlier date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's thesis runs along the following lines.  Massachusetts law affords prisoners serving indeterminate terms of years various ways to reduce their sentences.  These same options, Hamm claims, are not available to prisoners who are serving life sentences.  Thus, if he had been paroled into his (indeterminate) from-and-after sentences in 1983, he could have availed himself of these opportunities and possibly could have gained his freedom earlier than 2001.  Under the 1977 policy, however, he effectively remains on \"life sentence status\" during the full term of his immurement and, therefore, cannot take advantage of these early-release opportunities, which include:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Establishing a \"Wrap-up\" Date.   Once paroled into his from-and-after sentences, the petitioner would immediately acquire, subject to divestiture for misconduct, statutory good time under Mass.Gen.L. ch. 127, Sec. 129.  This \"good time\" would be based on the top end of his indeterminate sentences (forty years) and would, the petitioner claims, amount to sixteen and one-half years.  He could earn additional good-time credits (up to seven and one-half days per month) by participating in educational and vocational programs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 127, Sec. 129D.  Moreover, the sentencing court (both initially and on resentencing) gave the petitioner 210 days credit on his four from-and-after sentences for presentence incarceration.  Hamm theorizes that this credit applies separately to each of his four from-and-after sentences, yielding an aggregate credit of two years and four months for jail time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume arguendo the accuracy of the petitioner's figures without independently verifying them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  These potential reductions, totalling twenty-three years and one month, would, if garnered, enable him to leave prison without undergoing a second parole hearing after serving just sixteen years and eleven months on his from-and-after sentences.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Hence, if the petitioner had been paroled into his from-and-after sentences in November of 1983, he might have established a wrap-up date in October 2000, thus bringing about his release more than a year earlier than his current aggregated parole-eligibility date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Early Parole.   Once paroled into his from-and-after sentences, the petitioner could also reduce the parole-ineligibility period of these sentences, which otherwise would remain at seventeen years and four months.  First, he asserts that he would be credited automatically with the same two years and four months of jail time.  But see note 7, supra, and accompanying text.  Second, his earned good time would effectively count as time served toward his parole-ineligible term.  On this basis, he argues that if he had gained parole from his life sentences in 1983 and earned section 129D credits from then on at the maximum rate, he might have been eligible for \"real\" parole as early as November of 1995.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Special Parole.   The petitioner's final opportunity-related theory suggests that aggregation has already deprived him of the possibility of obtaining special consideration parole as early as 1989, after serving just one-third of his from-and-after minimum sentences, less jail credits.  See Hamm v. Commissioner of Correction, 29 Mass.App. 1011, 564 N.E.2d 1032, 1033 n. 5 (Hamm II), rev. denied, 409 Mass. 1102, 566 N.E.2d 1131 (1991).  The respondent effectively parries this thrust, stating that Hamm may apply for this type of parole consideration even under the 1977 aggregation policy.  Finding no evidence in the record that the petitioner has made an effort to apply for special consideration parole, or that the Parole Board would not consider his request, we cannot conclude that aggregation has deprived the petitioner of this benefit.  See id.   Accordingly, we do not further discuss this aspect of Hamm's claim of harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>D. The 1988 Policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth revisited its parole-eligibility policy anent life prisoners facing from-and-after sentences in 1988, and resumed the practice of providing them with parole hearings at or near the fifteen-year mark.  A 1990 document prepared by the respondent, entitled \"Parole Eligibility Regulations, Policies, Procedures,\" explains that parole-eligible life sentences are an exception to the general aggregation policy \"because of the statutory requirement that a parole hearing be held after a definite period of time.\"   The about-face did not ameliorate the petitioner's professed plight;  the respondent declined to apply this policy retroactively because such an application, it feared, might hurt prisoners approaching their aggregated parole-eligibility dates.  Thus, Hamm's parole-eligibility date was not recalculated, and he remains incarcerated with no parole hearing on the horizon until November of 2001.E. The Habeas Proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner initiated state habeas proceedings in 1990, arguing, among other things, that the Commonwealth's failure to provide him with a parole hearing in 1983 deprived him of his right to due process of law, and that the 1977 policy, as applied to him, violated the prohibition on ex post facto laws.  A state superior court judge dismissed the petition, and the Massachusetts Appeals Court upheld the aggregation of the petitioner's sentences for purposes of determining parole eligibility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See Hamm II, 564 N.E.2d at 1033-34.   After the SJC denied further appellate review, the petitioner initiated federal habeas proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the Commonwealth had in fact applied a change in the law to petitioner, but it concluded that the change did not harm him and therefore posed no ex post facto problem.  On the due process claim, the court took a more receptive stance.  It interpreted section 133A as mandating that petitioner receive a parole hearing on his life sentences after fifteen years, and ruled that the Commonwealth's failure to provide him a hearing in that time frame deprived him of due process.  The court ordered the state to convene such a hearing nunc pro tunc, and to continue convening such hearings at three-year intervals should parole be denied.  See Hamm v. Latessa, No. 91-10667-WJS, slip op. at 14 (D.Mass. May 18, 1994) (Hamm III ).  The court also decreed that if, despite the serial parole hearings, the petitioner remained in custody beyond 2001, then in such event, the 1977 policy should be applied to him as written from that date forward.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We bifurcate our analysis, examining each of the petitioner's constitutional claims under a separate heading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>A. The Due Process Claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that section 133A applied to the petitioner and afforded him a liberty interest in the convening of a parole hearing in 1983 (as he neared the fifteen-year mark of his life sentences).  The court based this finding on its interpretation of section 133A, emphasizing that the statute is written in mandatory and unequivocal terms--\"Every prisoner who is serving a sentence for life ... shall be eligible for parole, and the parole board shall, within sixty days before the expiration of fifteen years of such sentence, conduct a public hearing....\" (emphasis supplied)--and makes no exception on its face for life prisoners who also have from-and-after sentences in prospect.  To buttress this view, the court noted that the aggregation policy expressed in section 133A could not apply to the petitioner because his life sentences by definition contain no \"minimum\" sentence, and therefore cannot be aggregated with his from-and-after sentences to determine parole eligibility.  Building on this foundation, the court held that the petitioner had an unequivocal statutory right to be considered for parole into his from-and-after sentences once he had served fifteen years of his life sentences, and that the Commonwealth unconstitutionally deprived him of this liberty interest by aggregating his life sentences with his from-and-after sentences and by failing to grant him an initial parole hearing in 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot accept the lower court's analysis.  It is settled that a statute providing for early release or other benefits under stipulated conditions may sometimes confer upon prison inmates a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  See Board of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U.S. 369, 373-81, 107 S.Ct. 2415, 2418-22, 96 L.Ed.2d 303 (1987);  Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, 442 U.S. 1, 12, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 2106, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979);  Wolff v.

At the time the district court issued its order, constitutional doctrine suggested that a state creates such a liberty interest \"by establishing 'substantive predicates' to govern official decision-making ... and, further, by mandating the outcome to be reached upon a finding that the relevant criteria have been met.\"  Thompson, 490 U.S. at 462, 109 S.Ct. at 1909 (quoting Hewitt v.

The statute at issue in Allen, for example, used \"mandatory language ('shall') to 'creat[e] a presumption that parole release will be granted' when the designated findings are made.\"  Allen, 482 U.S. at 377-78, 107 S.Ct. at 2421 (quoting Greenholtz, 442 U.S. at 12, 99 S.Ct. at 2106) (alterations in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In recent years, the tectonic plates have shifted.  In Sandin v. Conner, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995), the Justices explained that, rather than relying on the presence or absence of mandatory language in determining whether a statute or regulation confers a liberty interest, courts should focus their inquiry on the nature of the interest allegedly created by the state.  See id. at ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2297-3000.   State-created liberty interests \"will be generally limited to freedom from restraint which, while not exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the Due Process Clause of its own force ... nonetheless imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2300 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the question of whether a state law creates a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause is clearly one of federal constitutional law, the preliminary question of parsing the state law to determine its substance is not within the primary domain of a federal habeas court.  See Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 480, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991).  Federal courts \"are bound by a State's interpretation of its own statute.\"  Garner v. Louisiana, 368 U.S. 157, 166, 82 S.Ct. 248, 253, 7 L.Ed.2d 207 (1961).  Particularly relevant here is Hebert v. Louisiana, 272 U.S. 312, 47 S.Ct. 103, 71 L.Ed. 270 (1926).  In Hebert, a convicted defendant claimed that a state court's incorrect construction of state law led to the imposition of a more onerous sentence and thereby violated the Due Process Clause.  The Court rejected that claim, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>Whether state statutes shall be construed one way or another is a state question, the final decision of which rests with the courts of the State.  The due process of law clause in the Fourteenth Amendment does not take up the statutes of the several States and make them the test of what it requires;  nor does it enable this Court to revise the decisions of the state courts on questions of state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 316, 47 S.Ct. at 104.   The rule, then, is that a federal habeas court will not disturb the state courts' construction or application of state law unless it can be shown that such construction or application offends the Constitution or some (applicable) federal statute.  See Bowser v. Boggs, 20 F.3d 1060, 1065 (10th Cir.1994);  Smith v. McCotter, 786 F.2d 697, 700 (5th Cir.1986);  cf. Martinez v. California, 444 U.S. 277, 282, 100 S.Ct. 553, 557, 62 L.Ed.2d 481 (1980) (explaining that a state's interest in fashioning its own rules of state law is paramount to any federal interest except protecting individuals from state action that is wholly arbitrary and irrational).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the clearly demarcated boundaries of federal habeas review, the proper function of the court below was not to second-guess the state court as to what substantive guarantees the Commonwealth's statutory and regulatory mosaic provided under the particular circumstances, but, rather, simply to determine whether the respondent's application of its parole scheme, deemed lawful by the state's courts, violated the Due Process Clause.  The district court set out to accomplish the former task instead of the latter.  In so doing, it erred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, a Massachusetts state court has already ruled that section 133A, as it read both in 1968 and 1983, conveyed no right to a fifteen-year hearing, and, moreover, that the respondent's aggregation of Hamm's sentences was a permissible policy notwithstanding any contrary signposts in the text of the state statute.  See Hamm II, 564 N.E.2d at 1033-34.   We believe that we are duty bound to follow this authoritative exposition of state law and, concomitantly, to reject the district court's impromptu interpretation of state law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  See McGuire, 502 U.S. at 67-68, 112 S.Ct. at 479-80;  Garner, 368 U.S. at 166, 82 S.Ct. at 253.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered and rejected the petitioner's argument that the state appellate court's decision is \"so inconsistent with the statute's language and history that the state court decision itself [comprises] a wholly arbitrary and irrational action in violation of due process.\"  Ellard v.

A federal court must not exercise the raw power to strike down state laws in the name of the Constitution with too much gusto.  Section 133A is silent on the parole eligibility of life prisoners facing from-and-after sentences;  a Massachusetts court had never before ruled on the issue:  and the appeals court based its holding on Henschel, which provided a defensible rationale for an aggregation policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Under these circumstances, it would be unprincipled to declare by federal fiat that the Due Process Clause broadly nullifies the Commonwealth's power to construe and apply its laws correctly.  See Lerner v. Gill, 751 F.2d 450, 459 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 472 U.S. 1010, 105 S.Ct. 2709, 86 L.Ed.2d 724 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner has also asserted that his fourteen years of state-induced reliance on a prospective 1983 parole hearing, followed by the state's abrupt shift in policy, deprived him of due process.  In mounting this challenge, he embraces our decisions in Lerner and in DeWitt v. Ventetoulo, 6 F.3d 32 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1542, 128 L.Ed.2d 193 (1994).  Hamm's ardor is mislaid.  Those cases addressed the power of a state court retroactively to correct an erroneous sentence or a mistaken interpretation of state law.  See DeWitt, 6 F.3d at 34-35;  Lerner, 751 F.2d at 458-59.   However, the calculation of the petitioner's original parole-eligibility date was not \"incorrect,\" so he arguably possessed a greater interest in seeing it carried out than would a prisoner who was the beneficiary of a botched calculation.  Nevertheless, the Lerner/ DeWitt line of cases does not invalidate the Commonwealth's actions.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though we observed in Lerner, 751 F.2d at 458, that \"unforeseeable changes ... made after the passage of a substantial period of time may, in some presumably extreme circumstances, be fundamentally unfair and hence violative of due process even if designed to correct an illegal sentence,\" this observation is inapposite here.  In the first place, we do not think that the Massachusetts Appeals Court decision was unforeseeable;  as stated above, the statute was silent on the precise situation, there was no decisional law directly on the point, and Henschel adumbrated the result reached in Hamm II.   In the second place, a convict must show special prejudice stemming from a changed interpretation.  See DeWitt, 6 F.3d at 35.   This requisite showing must consist of something more tangible than merely demonstrating that \"hopes were raised only to be dashed.\"  Lerner, 751 F.2d at 459.   Hamm has not suffered prejudice even remotely approaching that sustained by Lerner, whose parole-ineligibility period was extended from ten years to twenty years after he had (1) undergone two parole hearings, (2) moved into a minimum-security facility and accepted other privileges, and (3) transported his family to another state and caused them to invest in a business to create an employment opportunity for him, see id. at 453--to whom we denied relief under the Due Process Clause, see id. at 459.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, all roads lead to Rome.  We hold that the Commonwealth did not infract the petitioner's rights under the Due Process Clause when it failed to provide him a parole hearing in 1983.  The administrative scheme in force at that time, approved as lawful by a state appellate court, did not mandate that petitioner receive a parole hearing after fifteen years.

Petitioner asseverates that, by depriving him of opportunities to obtain his release earlier than November of 2001, the 1977 aggregation policy made his punishment more burdensome and is, therefore, an impermissible ex post facto law.  The Commonwealth demurs.  In its view, the 1977 policy is not a \"law\" subject to the ex post facto proscription, and in all events, the resultant aggregation did not increase the petitioner's punishment.  Because we agree with the Commonwealth's second contention, we need not decide the thorny question of whether the 1977 policy comprised a \"law\" subject to ex post facto analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In line with the foregoing, we assume for argument's sake, but do not decide, that the 1977 aggregation policy constituted a regulation possessing the full force and effect of law, and that it is therefore subject to analysis under the Ex Post Facto Clause.

The prescribed inquiry demands that we compare the new law with the old in its totality to ascertain \"if the new may be fairly characterized as more onerous.\"  Id.  The inquiry must be carried out in practical, as opposed to purely theoretical, terms;  the ex post facto prohibition does not foreclose every change in the law that possesses some imaginable risk of adversely affecting an inmate's punishment.  See Morales, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1602.

There, the Justices examined a state statute that permitted parole boards to defer parole suitability hearings for up to three years for double murderers and certain other prisoners if the board specifically found that it was unreasonable to expect that parole would be granted during the intervening years.  The Court concluded that the statute created \"only the most speculative and attenuated possibility of producing the prohibited effect of increasing the measure of punishment for covered crimes,\" and held that these \"conjectural effects\" were insufficient to animate the Ex Post Facto Clause.

First, the statute applied only to \"a class of prisoners for whom the likelihood of release on parole is quite remote.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1603.   Second, the statute cabined the parole board's discretion by requiring it to make a specific finding that a particular prisoner was unlikely to be paroled.  See id.   Third, the statute only applied to those who were denied parole eligibility the first time around, thus restricting the affected class to those least likely to be found suitable for parole.  See id.   Finally, though the statute addressed the frequency of suitability hearings, it empowered the board to \"tailor the frequency of subsequent suitability hearings to the particular circumstances of the individual prisoner.\"  Id.  The Court also noted that \"the possibility of immediate release after a finding of suitability for parole is largely theoretical;  in many cases, the prisoner's parole release date comes at least several years after a finding of suitability,\" and so \"the practical effect of a hearing postponement is not significant.\"  Id.

Though the parole scheme in effect in 1968 may have afforded him the possibility of terminating his incarceration as early as 1995 if a series of events materialized, it seems highly unlikely that these events would have come to pass.  The likelihood of harm, therefore, is tiny.  And, moreover, it is at least equally possible that, because of the structural differences imposed by the two policies, Hamm may well have languished in prison longer under the old scheme than under the new.  On balance, then, it is virtually impossible to prognosticate the risk that the petitioner may be released at a later date because the 1977 policy rather than its predecessor, controls in his case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the original policy, unless the petitioner managed to obtain parole in 1983 and thereafter amassed all possible credits, he would still have to be paroled a second time in order to be released as early as 1995, or, alternatively, to garner every conceivable credit in order to attain a wrap-up date in October of 2000.  The record is bereft of any evidence suggesting that Hamm would probably achieve prompt parole into his from-and-after sentences, become a model prisoner, go on to earn all available credits, and then be paroled out of, or otherwise released from, his from-and-after sentences at any time before 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  In fine, this case, like Morales, involves a situation in which the possibility of harm is entirely speculative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case also possesses a further dimension that weighs against the petitioner's position.  Whereas the new law in Morales could not conceivably have inured to a prisoner's benefit, the new aggregation policy that the Commonwealth adopted in 1977 might very well redound to the petitioner's advantage.  After all, the 1977 policy eliminates the need for two parole permits and ensures that the petitioner will be eligible for parole from all his sentences at one fell swoop.  Under the old policy, if the respondent denied the petitioner parole into his from-and-after sentences in 1983, 1986, and 1989--not an unlikely eventuality in light of Hamm's mottled record--his wrap-up date, even assuming the accrual of all conceivable credits, would not occur until sometime in 2006.  This is a full five years after the date on which he could be paroled from all his sentences under the 1977 policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This scenario prompted the district court to conclude that \"[i]n 1982, when the respondent recalculated the petitioner's parole eligibility, it was not clear whether the petitioner would be helped or harmed by aggregation; the balance sheet is unclear even today.\"  Hamm III, slip op. at 10.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  This statement is unarguably accurate, and the uncertainty that it portends strips the veneer of plausibility from the petitioner's ex post facto initiative.  Morales makes it crystal clear that such uncertainty militates against the petitioner because any other approach would \"effectively shift[ ] to the State the burden of persuasion as to [the prisoner's] ex post facto claim.\"  Id. --- U.S. at ---- n. 6, 115 S.Ct. at 1603 n. 6.   A party who asserts an ex post facto claim must show a real possibility of cognizable harm, not a theoretical possibility bound up in gossamer strands of speculation and surmise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find illuminating a recent decision of another court that needed to construct the ex post facto balance of prospective benefits and burdens.  In United States v. McGee, 60 F.3d 1266 (7th Cir.1995), the court addressed an amendment that became law following the defendant's conviction but before the imposition of sentence.  The amendment eliminated a twelve-month minimum sentence for the offense of conviction and replaced it with a range of twenty-one to twenty-four months.  The district court imposed the maximum twenty-four-month sentence.  The defendant appealed, claiming that the amendment violated the ex post facto prohibition because it removed the possibility of a shorter sentence, i.e., a sentence of between twelve and twenty-one months.  The Seventh Circuit disagreed.  It noted that, although the amendment eliminated an opportunity for a milder sentence, it also placed a ceiling on the maximum available sentence, thus narrowing \"the range of punishment to [the defendant's] benefit.\"  Id. at 1271.   This potential benefit made an evaluation of the risk that the new law might subject the prisoner to harsher punishment too speculative to constitute an ex post facto violation.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Seventh Circuit's rationale is persuasive here.  Due to the peculiar concatenation of circumstances--especially the profound uncertainty over how the petitioner would have fared under the old system and the potential benefits that may accrue to him under the new regime--the potential risk of more Draconian punishment under the 1977 policy defies reliable measurement.  As a result, we hold that the application of the new policy to the petitioner did not insult the Ex Post Facto Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

Unlike my colleagues, however, I am persuaded that, as applied to Hamm and other similarly-situated prisoners, the 1977 aggregation policy is an unconstitutional ex post facto law.  First, I believe that the 1977 aggregation policy, which effectively altered the date of Hamm's initial parole hearing, is a \"law\" subject to ex post facto limitations.  Second, contrary to my colleagues, I believe that the 1977 policy, as applied to Hamm and other similarly-situated prisoners, clearly produces a risk of increasing the measure of punishment sufficient to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.  Hence, I respectfully dissent from parts II.B.-III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article 1, Sec. 10 of the Constitution clearly proscribes the authority of a state to enact any ex post facto law.

Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37, 42, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 2719, 111 L.Ed.2d 30 (1990) (quoting Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U.S. 167, 169-70, 46 S.Ct. 68, 68, 70 L.Ed. 216 (1925));  see also California Dep't of Corrections v. Morales, --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 1601, 131 L.Ed.2d 588 (1995) (\"the Clause is aimed at laws that retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts\") (internal quotation omitted).  In general, an ex post facto inquiry requires a two-step analysis.  See Miller v. Florida, 482 U.S. 423, 430, 107 S.Ct. 2446, 2451, 96 L.Ed.2d 351 (1987).  A court should ask (1) whether the challenged provision is a \"law\" that acts retrospectively, and (2) whether the burden the law retrospectively imposes is of sufficient type and degree to violate the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Hamm argues that the 1977 aggregation policy violated the Ex Post Facto Clause by retroactively depriving him of opportunities to obtain his release earlier than November 2001.  In response, the Commonwealth contends that the 1977 aggregation policy was not a \"law\" subject to ex post facto limitation, and that, in any event, the aggregation did not increase Hamm's punishment.  My colleagues agree with the second contention, and therefore find it unnecessary to consider the first.  Because, as I explain more fully infra at 961-964, I believe that the 1977 aggregation policy engendered a sufficient risk of increasing Hamm's punishment, I cannot avoid the first prong of the Commonwealth's argument.  Accordingly, I proceed first to explore fully whether the 1977 aggregation policy is a \"law\" subject to ex post facto proscription, and, second, to discuss my disagreement with the majority over whether the new policy produces a risk of increasing the measure of punishment sufficient to violate the Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p>A.

Although the aggregation policy was not formally promulgated as a regulation governing the Parole Board, it was as binding on the Parole Board, on a case-by-case basis, as an act passed by the legislature would have been.  Moreover, the Commonwealth does not argue that, once the policy had been promulgated, the Parole Board had any discretion to deviate from the policy in any particular instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has not addressed the question of whether an administrative policy or regulation can be an ex post facto law.  A number of circuit courts, however, have held that binding administrative regulations, as opposed to those that serve merely as guidelines for discretionary decisionmaking, are laws subject to ex post facto limitation.  For example, in a case factually similar to this one, the Ninth Circuit held that the California Department of Corrections's recalculation of a prisoner's parole-eligibility date under its new interpretation of the governing statutes violated the Ex Post Facto Clause because \"the Department has changed its interpretation of the authority itself.\"  Love v. Fitzharris, 460 F.2d 382, 385 (9th Cir.1972), vacated as moot, 409 U.S. 1100, 93 S.Ct. 896, 34 L.Ed.2d 682 (1973).  The Love court stated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p>the interpretation of the relationship between the statutes ... by the administrative agency charged with their enforcement has the force and effect of law....  [N]ot only defendants, in contemplating their pleas, but also trial courts, in imposing sentences, are entitled to rely on such administrative interpretations....  A new administrative interpretation which subjects the prisoner already sentenced to more severe punishment has the same effect as a new statute lengthening his present term....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.  (citations omitted).  The Eleventh Circuit similarly concluded that a regulation, promulgated pursuant to the Georgia parole board's delegated legislative power, that changed the period between inmate's parole hearings from one to eight years was a \"law\" subject to ex post facto limitation.  Akins v. Snow, 922 F.2d 1558, 1561 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1260, 111 S.Ct. 2915, 115 L.Ed.2d 1079 (1991);  see also Rodriguez v. United States Parole Comm'n, 594 F.2d 170, 174 (7th Cir.1979) (new regulation eliminating parole hearing after one-third of sentence is \"tantamount to a statute\" for ex post facto purposes).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In those cases holding that particular administrative regulations or guidelines were not laws subject to the Ex Post Facto Clause, courts have often premised their holdings, at least in part, on the advisory nature of the regulation or guidelines in question.  See, e.g., Kelly v. Southerland, 967 F.2d 1531, 1532-33 (11th Cir.1992) (rescission guidelines promulgated by federal Parole Commission did not violate Ex Post Facto Clause because they both were subject to amendment by the Commission and merely guided, but did not dictate, actual parole decisions);  Smith v. United States Parole Comm'n, 875 F.2d 1361, 1367 (9th Cir.1988) (finding parole \"regulation\" was not an ex post facto law and noting that \"the operative factor in assessing whether a directive constitutes a 'law' for ex post facto purposes is the discretion that the Parole Commission retains to modify that directive or to ignore it altogether as the circumstances may require\");  Inglese v. United States Parole Comm'n, 768 F.2d 932, 936 (7th Cir.1985) (\"The power to exercise discretion indicates that the [parole] guidelines are merely guides, and not law:  guides may be discarded when circumstances require;  laws may not.\").  Moreover, these cases involve the federal Parole Commission's guidelines, which are \"truly advisory\" because the Commission possesses the authority to disregard them in the appropriate circumstances.  Bailey v. Gardebring, 940 F.2d 1150, 1158 (8th Cir.1991) (Lay, C.J., dissenting), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 952, 112 S.Ct. 1516, 117 L.Ed.2d 652 (1992).  The Commonwealth makes no claim that its aggregation policy was merely \"advisory\" or that it was free to disregard the policy in a particular case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth does postulate, however, that because it had discretion to adopt the 1977 aggregation policy in the first place and to modify the policy subsequently, as it did in 1988, the policy should not be considered a law.  Although a number of the federal Parole Commission cases have relied in part on this reasoning,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> see, e.g., Smith, 875 F.2d at 1367, I would reject it here.  The argument not only exalts form over substance but its logic suggests that even legislative acts, because they too may be modified, should be immune to challenge under the Ex Post Facto Clause.  See Bailey, 940 F.2d at 1158 (Lay, C.J., dissenting).  A binding policy or regulation, promulgated pursuant to delegated legislative authority by an administrative body that implicitly retains authority to amend it in the future, is no different in its force and effect than a law passed by a legislature that retains authority to amend or revoke that law.  The Commonwealth's Parole Board possessed delegated legislative authority to promulgate the aggregation policy:  \"The parole board shall ... make rules relative to the performance of its duties.\"   Mass.Gen.L. ch. 27, Sec. 5(e).  Furthermore, under Massachusetts law, an agency regulation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> \"promulgated pursuant to a legislative grant of power generally [has] the force of law.\"  Kenney v. Commissioner of Correction, 393 Mass. 28, 468 N.E.2d 616, 619 (1984).  Thus, because the 1977 aggregation policy was effectively a regulation having the full force and effect of law, I would hold that it is subject to limitation under the Ex Post Facto Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p>B. Does the 1977 Aggregation Policy Produce a Sufficient Risk of Increasing the Measure of Punishment?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I now turn to the issue at the heart of my disagreement with the majority:  Whether, as applied to Hamm and other similarly-situated prisoners, the 1977 aggregation policy produces a risk of increased punishment sufficient to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause?   My colleagues answer this question in the negative, basing their conclusion on two premises.  First they deem it highly unlikely that, under the prior policy, Hamm would have won early parole from his life sentence and acquired the necessary good-time credits to advance the date of his ultimate parole hearing to a point earlier than 2001.  Hence, they conclude that any harm to Hamm ensuing from the 1977 aggregation policy is highly speculative.  Second, they posit that, due to structural differences between the two policies, a \"real\" benefit accrues to Hamm under the new policy.  Then, combining these two premises, my colleagues ultimately conclude that, on balance, the 1977 aggregation policy does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.  I strongly disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My colleagues favorably compare the risk of increased punishment occasioned by the 1977 aggregation policy with the risk of increased punishment recently examined by the Supreme Court in California Dep't of Corrections v. Morales, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 131 L.Ed.2d 588 (1995).  In Morales, the Court considered an amendment permitting the California state parole board to defer annual parole-suitability hearings for up to three years for prisoners at least twice convicted of murder.  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1600.   In upholding the amendment, the Court rejected the contention that it violated the Ex Post Facto Clause simply because the deferral of subsequent suitability hearings deprived affected prisoners of an opportunity to gain an earlier release from prison.  Id. at ---- n. 3, 115 S.Ct. at 1602 n. 3.   The Court explained that just because the amendment caused the loss of some theoretical opportunity to gain an earlier release did not mean that it necessarily violates the Constitution.  Id.  Instead, the Court held that, for ex post facto purposes, the test is whether the loss of that opportunity actually produces a \"sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment for the attached crimes.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1603.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In applying this test, the Court focused on several factors that significantly minimized the California amendment's risk of harm.  Morales, at ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1603-05.   First, the Court noted the amendment's limited application.  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1603.   The amendment had no effect on any prisoner unless the California parole board first found that the prisoner was both unsuitable for parole and unlikely to be found suitable at subsequent hearings during the deferral period.  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1604.   Moreover, the Court noted that the amendment did not affect \"the date of any prisoner's initial parole suitability hearing:  it affected the timing only of subsequent hearings.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1605.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the Court observed, inter alia, that, even with respect to a prisoner who might have actually received a favorable recommendation at an omitted hearing, the practical effect of the amendment on that prisoner's ultimate release date was only slight.  Morales, at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1605.   At the deferred hearings, the parole board determined only a prisoner's \"suitability\" for parole but did not set actual parole dates.  Id.  The Court noted that, significantly, in many cases, an actual parole date comes several years after a finding of suitability.  Id.  Moreover, under California law, evidence that a prisoner in fact had been \"suitable\" for a year or two prior to the date of the prisoner's delayed hearing would be relevant in setting the prisoner's actual parole date.  Id.  Hence, the Court concluded that, in most cases, any delay resulting from the amendment could be corrected by the parole board when it set the prisoner's ultimate release date.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the Court recognized that the amendment's built-in limitations, severely restricting both its application and potential effect, effectively minimized any risk of increased punishment caused by the elimination of subsequent suitability hearings.  Furthermore, the Court carefully limited the breadth of its holding, expressly disavowing any opinion \"as to the constitutionality of any of a number of statutes that might alter the timing of parole hearings under circumstances different from those present here.\"  Morales, at ----, n. 6, 115 S.Ct. at 1603 n. 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On close analysis, I believe the effect of the 1977 aggregation policy challenged here differs significantly from the risk of increased harm produced by the Morales amendment.  First, in contrast to the Morales amendment, the adoption of the 1977 aggregation policy potentially affects all Massachusetts prisoners previously eligible for parole from a life sentence into consecutive from-and-after sentences.  No provision in the policy limits the class of affected prisoners to only those adjudged by the Commonwealth's Parole Board (or some similar body) to be unlikely to win early parole or to earn significant good-time credits.  Moreover, where the Morales amendment affected only subsequent hearings, the 1977 aggregation policy essentially delays an affected prisoner's initial parole hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, also in contrast to Morales, the impact of the 1977 aggregation policy on those it affects is substantial.  For example, under the prior policy, Hamm could have terminated his incarceration as early as 1995, through the acquisition of earned and statutory good-time credits and the application of his jail credits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  The 1977 aggregation policy extinguished that possibility;  Hamm's term of incarceration cannot end under the 1977 policy before his first-available parole hearing in 2001.  Thus, in contrast to the amendment in Morales, which will have little, if any, real impact on an affected prisoner's actual time in prison, the 1977 aggregation policy could potentially increase Hamm's prison term by up to six years.  See Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 26-27, 31-34, 101 S.Ct. 960, 962-63, 965-67, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981) (holding that new state statute reducing amount of good time that could be earned prospectively by current inmates violates Ex Post Facto Clause because it removed existing opportunity for shortened prison time).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My colleagues gloss over these clear distinctions by positing that, whatever the risk might have been at the outset, given the brutal nature of Hamm's crime and his poor record as a prisoner, it is highly unlikely that Hamm could have availed himself of the opportunity to obtain an earlier release.  Such analysis, however, is more akin to a harmless error inquiry focusing on the particulars of Hamm's case than to a proper ex post facto inquiry into whether the new law posed a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment.  Moreover, while it is clear that Hamm bears the ultimate burden of establishing that the new law changes the measure of punishment, Morales, --- U.S. at ----, n. 6, 115 S.Ct. at 1603 n. 6, this does not mean that he must necessarily show \"that he would have been sentenced to a lesser term under the measure or range of punishments in place under the previous statutory scheme.\"  Id. (citing Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U.S. 397, 401, 57 S.Ct. 797, 799, 81 L.Ed. 1182 (1937));  see also id. --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1607 (Stevens, Souter, J.J., dissenting);  Miller v. Florida, 482 U.S. 423, 432, 107 S.Ct. 2446, 2452, 96 L.Ed.2d 351 (1987) (reaffirming Lindsey ).   Indeed, the proper \"inquiry looks to the challenged provision, and not to any special circumstances that may mitigate its effect on the particular individual.\"  Weaver, 450 U.S. at 33, 101 S.Ct. at 966.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the fact of the matter is that the 1977 aggregation policy completely deprived Hamm of his once-existing opportunity to gain a release from prison as much as six years earlier than he can now.  Moreover, notwithstanding my colleagues' post hoc evaluation of Hamm's chances, because Hamm never received a parole hearing, no findings exist to inform us whether or not the Commonwealth would have found Hamm to be a likely candidate for early parole from his life sentence.  Indeed, without such findings or even knowledge concerning the standards and policies that guide the Commonwealth's Parole Board in making such recommendations, this court can only speculate as to whether the 1977 aggregation policy posed a sufficient risk to Hamm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Morales, the Court reasoned that the delay in parole suitability hearings caused by the challenged amendment did not produce a sufficient risk of punishment because, in major part, the amendment affected only a carefully limited class of prisoners, and the impact of any delay on an affected prisoner's actual time in prison was negligible.  Implicit in the Court's holding, however, is the recognition that delay in a parole hearing produces some possibility of an increase in punishment.  Where, as here, the delay is not predicated on a finding that the prisoner is an unlikely candidate for parole, and the delay may significantly increase the prisoner's sentence, I believe, even in Hamm's case, such delay produces a \"sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment.\"  Morales, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1603.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, my colleagues also base their conclusion on the premise that the 1977 aggregation policy arguably provides a \"real\" benefit to Hamm and other affected prisoners.  I believe, however, that it is this putative \"benefit\" that is too \"speculative\" to merit significant weight in the ex post facto inquiry.  Any fair analysis reveals that the supposed benefit arising from the 1977 aggregation policy assumes several rather contradictory predicates.  For example, to find that Hamm would benefit from the 1977 policy, I would need to assume both (1) that, under the prior policy, the Commonwealth's Parole Board would have refused to grant Hamm parole from his life sentence at least three times (in 1983, 1986, and 1989), or that, if the board did grant him such initial parole, he would have subsequently failed to accrue good-time credits, and (2) that, under the new policy, the Parole Board would then grant him \"real\" parole into society at large in 2001 (notwithstanding that the board would not even have granted Hamm parole from his life sentence into his lengthy from-and-after sentences on at least three prior occasions).  In other words, the Parole Board would have to deny Hamm's request for parole from one lengthy sentence into another at least three times, but then, a short time later, be willing essentially to grant Hamm a complete release from prison.  The inherent contradiction in such assumptions discloses the difficulty of quantifying such a \"benefit,\" or even determining whether one genuinely exists.  Thus, I believe that any benefit engendered by the 1977 aggregation policy is much too speculative to serve as an effective counterweight to its real risk of harm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, I believe that the 1977 aggregation policy is a \"law\" subject to ex post facto limitation, and that the policy produces a risk of increasing the measure of punishment sufficient to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution.

The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing and found, on the basis of the petitioner's prison records and testimony from former and current counsel to the Parole Board, that prior to 1977 the respondent did in fact follow a practice of providing fifteen-year parole hearings to life prisoners facing from-and-after sentences.

We need not probe the point too deeply, however, inasmuch as the Commonwealth has not disputed the petitioner's contention that his parole-eligibility date under the 1977 aggregation policy is in November of 2001.

On this point, the court wrote:</p>\n        <p>The plaintiff's situation does not present an ex post facto issue.  The rules have not been changed adversely to him.

See, e.g., Fidelity Union Trust Co. v. Field, 311 U.S. 169, 177-78, 61 S.Ct. 176, 177-78, 85 L.Ed. 109 (1940) (\"An intermediate state court in declaring and applying the state law is acting as an organ of the State and its determination, in the absence of more convincing evidence of what the state law is, should be followed by a federal court in deciding a state question.\")</p>\n        <p>The respondent's 1988 about-face and its return to a non-aggregation policy for life inmates does not suggest a different outcome.  Given the language of the statute and the discretion reposed in the Parole Board, it is entirely plausible that both the 1977 and 1988 policies are permissible interpretations of state law.  Cf. Strickland v. Commissioner, Me.  Dept. of Human Servs., 48 F.3d 12, 17-18 (1st Cir.)

See, e.g., Akins v. Snow, 922 F.2d 1558, 1561 (11th Cir.1991) (holding that Georgia parole board's new regulation promulgated pursuant to delegated legislative power that changed period between inmate's parole hearings from one year to eight years was a law subject to ex post facto analysis), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1260, 111 S.Ct. 2915, 115 L.Ed.2d 1079 (1991);  Rodriguez v. United States Parole Comm'n, 594 F.2d 170, 174 (7th Cir.1979) (deeming a new regulation that eliminated a parole hearing after one-third of a prisoner's sentence \"tantamount to a statute\" for ex post facto purposes);  Love v. Fitzharris, 460 F.2d 382, 385 (9th Cir.1972) (holding that a state's recalculation of a prisoner's parole-eligibility date under a new interpretation of the governing statutes violated the Ex Post Facto Clause because the state had changed its interpretation midstream), vacated as moot, 409 U.S. 1100, 93 S.Ct. 896, 34 L.Ed.2d 682 (1973).  There are, of course, cases--mostly involving the federal Parole Commission's guidelines--that can be read as holding the other way.  See, e.g., Kelly v. Southerland, 967 F.2d 1531, 1532-33 (11th Cir.1992);  Inglese v. United States Parole Comm'n, 768 F.2d 932, 936 (7th Cir.1985).

The Morales Court rejected a similar argument, emphasizing that such an \"arbitrary line has absolutely no basis in the Constitution.  If a delay in parole hearings raises ex post facto concerns, it is because that delay effectively increases a prisoner's term of confinement, and not because the hearing itself has independent constitutional significance.\"  Morales, at ---- n. 4, 115 S.Ct. at 1603 n. 4.   The dissent's mechanical approach not only ignores this admonition but also overlooks Morales 's central holding, namely, that a proper ex post facto inquiry must focus on the risk that the prisoner will be subject to an increased measure of punishment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> If past is prologue, cf. W. Shakespeare, The Tempest, act II, sc. i (1612), all of these prospects seem extremely dubious.  Hamm's disciplinary record reveals a cavalcade of misconduct, including episodes of inciting a prison riot, arson, assaulting a guard, attempting an escape, conspiring to take a hostage, organizing a work stoppage, and possessing controlled substances.  These are not the emblemata of an inmate who is likely either to inspire a parole board to act favorably on his behalf or to accumulate good-time credits at a rapid rate</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> There are, of course, other similarities to Morales.   We mention two of them.  First, the challenged policy here--like the statute at issue in Morales, at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1603--applies only to a limited class of prisoners (here, life inmates who face the overhanging prospect of from-and-after sentences) for whom the likelihood of release on parole is considerably below the norm.  Second, the availability of special parole, see supra Part I(C)(3), offers the Parole Board the flexibility that the Morales Court deemed important.  See id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1604</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> The Morales Court pointed out that the relevant inquiry must not focus \"on whether a legislative change produces some ambiguous sort of 'disadvantage,' ... but on whether any such change ... increases the penalty by which a crime is punishable.\"  Morales, --- U.S. at ---- n. 3, 115 S.Ct. at 1602 n. 3.   Despite the fact that the district court issued its opinion without the benefit of Morales and framed the corresponding part of its ruling as an inquiry into whether the 1977 policy resulted in a \"[d]isadvantage to the petitioner,\" it nonetheless made a thoroughgoing examination of the uncertainty inherent in comparing potential results under the old and new policies</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> I do not restate the facts or outline the prior proceedings.

See Majority at 952.  I note, however, that the claim is not critical to my analysis.  Even without the 840 days, the 1977 aggregation policy deprives Hamm of the opportunity to advance his initial ultimate parole date by over three and half years</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> The fact that the record lacks the opinion, much less the findings, of the Commonwealth's Parole Board on Hamm's suitability for early parole clearly underscores the inappropriateness of my colleagues' \"harmless error\" style review</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> My colleagues find further support in the Seventh Circuit's recent decision in United States v. McGee, 60 F.3d 1266, 1271 (7th Cir.1995).  In McGee, the Seventh Circuit rejected an ex post facto challenge to a sentencing provision that substituted a mandatory range of 21 to 24 months in place of an open-ended 12 month minimum sentence for the offense of conviction.  Id.  I find the analogy inapt because in McGee the district court had actually sentenced the defendant to the maximum 24 months under the new sentencing range prior to the Seventh Circuit's review.  Thus, the Seventh Court could fairly quantify both the benefit and the harm produced by the new sentencing range.  Significantly, the fact that the district court had sentenced the defendant to the maximum possible under the new sentencing scheme clearly suggested that, if anything, it would have given the defendant a higher, not lesser, sentence under the old scheme.  In our case, however, Hamm received no analogous treatment.  He received no parole hearing.  Thus, instead of fairly quantifying the risk as the McGee court did, we can only speculate as to the effect the 1977 aggregation policy will ultimately have on his sentence</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

These consecutive sentences were to be served \"from and after\" the life sentences.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The appeals court, in an unpublished rescript, reduced the from-and-after sentences to twenty-six to forty years but upheld the convictions and sentences in all other respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>B.

Based on that interpretation of the statute, the Commonwealth granted such inmates parole hearings (for possible parole from their life sentences into their from-and-after sentences) once they had served close to fifteen years.  Accordingly, after the state court sentenced Hamm, correctional officials advised him that the parole-eligibility date referable to his life sentences would be November 28, 1983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>C. The 1977 Aggregation Policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1977, the Commonwealth recast its interpretation of section 133A.  The impetus for change was the decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) in Henschel v. Commissioner of Correction, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2017936\"><a href=\"/opinion/2017936/henschel-v-commissioner-of-correction/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2017936\"><a href=\"/opinion/2017936/henschel-v-commissioner-of-correction/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span> </a></span>(Mass.1975).  Henschel required the aggregation for parole-eligibility purposes of a prisoner's consecutive county house of correction and state institution sentences.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2017936\"><a href=\"/opinion/2017936/henschel-v-commissioner-of-correction/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> 330 N.E.2d </a></span>at 483-85.   The SJC advanced a thoughtful justification in support of aggregation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>To follow the defendant's [non-aggregation] approach would require the board to make a series of decisions granting parole from one sentence to the next rather than a single decision on the basis of one parole eligibility date for all sentences.  The former procedure makes little sense since the decision to grant parole is to be based on whether the board believes the prisoner can live freely outside of prison without violating the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2017936\"><a href=\"/opinion/2017936/henschel-v-commissioner-of-correction/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> 330 N.E.2d </a></span>at 484.   The Commonwealth found this rationale to be equally convincing in the context of making decisions to parole prisoners serving life sentences into overhanging from-and-after sentences.  Consequently, it rethought its earlier interpretation of section 133A and revised its policies regarding parole eligibility for certain classes of inmates, including lifers who faced impending from-and-after sentences.  Under the neoteric policy, such inmates were not regarded as falling under section 133A and would no longer receive parole hearings at the fifteen-year mark;  instead, the parole-ineligible portion of the prisoner's life sentence (fifteen years) would be aggregated with the parole-ineligible portion of his from-and-after sentences to arrive at a \"real\" parole-eligibility date, that is to say, a single date at which a favorable parole decision would result in the prisoner's actual release from incarceration, not just his parole from one sentence into another.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  While this paradigm was not compelled by the holding in Henschel (which did not specifically address the aggregation of life sentences with from-and-after sentences), the respondent determined that the new arrangement more faithfully mirrored the tenets undergirding Henschel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1982--the year before Hamm would have received his initial section 133A hearing under the former policy--the Commonwealth applied the new policy to him and recalculated his parole-eligibility date.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The aggregation resulted in a single, \"real\" parole-eligibility date of November 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Though this structural change obviated the need for the petitioner to obtain two parole permits to secure his release in 2001, he claims that it also impermissibly deprived him of an opportunity for release at an earlier date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's thesis runs along the following lines.  Massachusetts law affords prisoners serving indeterminate terms of years various ways to reduce their sentences.  These same options, Hamm claims, are not available to prisoners who are serving life sentences.  Thus, if he had been paroled into his (indeterminate) from-and-after sentences in 1983, he could have availed himself of these opportunities and possibly could have gained his freedom earlier than 2001.  Under the 1977 policy, however, he effectively remains on \"life sentence status\" during the full term of his immurement and, therefore, cannot take advantage of these early-release opportunities, which include:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Establishing a \"Wrap-up\" Date.   Once paroled into his from-and-after sentences, the petitioner would immediately acquire, subject to divestiture for misconduct, statutory good time under Mass.Gen.L. ch. 127, Sec. 129.  This \"good time\" would be based on the top end of his indeterminate sentences (forty years) and would, the petitioner claims, amount to sixteen and one-half years.  He could earn additional good-time credits (up to seven and one-half days per month) by participating in educational and vocational programs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 127, Sec. 129D.  Moreover, the sentencing court (both initially and on resentencing) gave the petitioner 210 days credit on his four from-and-after sentences for presentence incarceration.  Hamm theorizes that this credit applies separately to each of his four from-and-after sentences, yielding an aggregate credit of two years and four months for jail time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume arguendo the accuracy of the petitioner's figures without independently verifying them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  These potential reductions, totalling twenty-three years and one month, would, if garnered, enable him to leave prison without undergoing a second parole hearing after serving just sixteen years and eleven months on his from-and-after sentences.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Hence, if the petitioner had been paroled into his from-and-after sentences in November of 1983, he might have established a wrap-up date in October 2000, thus bringing about his release more than a year earlier than his current aggregated parole-eligibility date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Early Parole.   Once paroled into his from-and-after sentences, the petitioner could also reduce the parole-ineligibility period of these sentences, which otherwise would remain at seventeen years and four months.  First, he asserts that he would be credited automatically with the same two years and four months of jail time.  But see note <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">7,</span> supra</span>, and accompanying text.  Second, his earned good time would effectively count as time served toward his parole-ineligible term.  On this basis, he argues that if he had gained parole from his life sentences in 1983 and earned section 129D credits from then on at the maximum rate, he might have been eligible for \"real\" parole as early as November of 1995.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Special Parole.   The petitioner's final opportunity-related theory suggests that aggregation has already deprived him of the possibility of obtaining special consideration parole as early as 1989, after serving just one-third of his from-and-after minimum sentences, less jail credits.  See Hamm v. Commissioner of Correction, 29 Mass.App. 1011, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1032</span></span>, 1033 n. 5 (Hamm II), rev. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1102</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1131</span> </span>(1991).  The respondent effectively parries this thrust, stating that Hamm may apply for this type of parole consideration even under the 1977 aggregation policy.  Finding no evidence in the record that the petitioner has made an effort to apply for special consideration parole, or that the Parole Board would not consider his request, we cannot conclude that aggregation has deprived the petitioner of this benefit.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>   Accordingly, we </span>do not further discuss this aspect of Hamm's claim of harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>D. The 1988 Policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth revisited its parole-eligibility policy anent life prisoners facing from-and-after sentences in 1988, and resumed the practice of providing them with parole hearings at or near the fifteen-year mark.  A 1990 document prepared by the respondent, entitled \"Parole Eligibility Regulations, Policies, Procedures,\" explains that parole-eligible life sentences are an exception to the general aggregation policy \"because of the statutory requirement that a parole hearing be held after a definite period of time.\"   The about-face did not ameliorate the petitioner's professed plight;  the respondent declined to apply this policy retroactively because such an application, it feared, might hurt prisoners approaching their aggregated parole-eligibility dates.  Thus, Hamm's parole-eligibility date was not recalculated, and he remains incarcerated with no parole hearing on the horizon until November of 2001.E. The Habeas Proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner initiated state habeas proceedings in 1990, arguing, among other things, that the Commonwealth's failure to provide him with a parole hearing in 1983 deprived him of his right to due process of law, and that the 1977 policy, as applied to him, violated the prohibition on ex post facto laws.  A state superior court judge dismissed the petition, and the Massachusetts Appeals Court upheld the aggregation of the petitioner's sentences for purposes of determining parole eligibility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See Hamm <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">II,</span> <span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1033-34</span></span>.   After the SJC denied further appellate review, the petitioner initiated federal habeas proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the Commonwealth had in fact applied a change in the law to petitioner, but it concluded that the change did not harm him and therefore posed no ex post facto problem.  On the due process claim, the court took a more receptive stance.  It interpreted section 133A as mandating that petitioner receive a parole hearing on his life sentences after fifteen years, and ruled that the Commonwealth's failure to provide him a hearing in that time frame deprived him of due process.  The court ordered the state to convene such a hearing nunc pro tunc, and to continue convening such hearings at three-year intervals should parole be denied.  See Hamm v. Latessa, No. 91-10667-WJS, slip op. at 14 (D.Mass. May 18, 1994) (Hamm III ).  The court also decreed that if, despite the serial parole hearings, the petitioner remained in custody beyond 2001, then in such event, the 1977 policy should be applied to him as written from that date forward.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We bifurcate our analysis, examining each of the petitioner's constitutional claims under a separate heading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>A. The Due Process Claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that section 133A applied to the petitioner and afforded him a liberty interest in the convening of a parole hearing in 1983 (as he neared the fifteen-year mark of his life sentences).  The court based this finding on its interpretation of section 133A, emphasizing that the statute is written in mandatory and unequivocal terms--\"Every prisoner who is serving a sentence for life ... shall be eligible for parole, and the parole board shall, within sixty days before the expiration of fifteen years of such sentence, conduct a public hearing....\" (emphasis supplied)--and makes no exception on its face for life prisoners who also have from-and-after sentences in prospect.  To buttress this view, the court noted that the aggregation policy expressed in section 133A could not apply to the petitioner because his life sentences by definition contain no \"minimum\" sentence, and therefore cannot be aggregated with his from-and-after sentences to determine parole eligibility.  Building on this foundation, the court held that the petitioner had an unequivocal statutory right to be considered for parole into his from-and-after sentences once he had served fifteen years of his life sentences, and that the Commonwealth unconstitutionally deprived him of this liberty interest by aggregating his life sentences with his from-and-after sentences and by failing to grant him an initial parole hearing in 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot accept the lower court's analysis.  It is settled that a statute providing for early release or other benefits under stipulated conditions may sometimes confer upon prison inmates a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  See Board of Pardons v.

Petitioner asseverates that, by depriving him of opportunities to obtain his release earlier than November of 2001, the 1977 aggregation policy made his punishment more burdensome and is, therefore, an impermissible ex post facto law.  The Commonwealth demurs.  In its view, the 1977 policy is not a \"law\" subject to the ex post facto proscription, and in all events, the resultant aggregation did not increase the petitioner's punishment.  Because we agree with the Commonwealth's second contention, we need not decide the thorny question of whether the 1977 policy comprised a \"law\" subject to ex post facto analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In line with the foregoing, we assume for argument's sake, but do not decide, that the 1977 aggregation policy constituted a regulation possessing the full force and effect of law, and that it is therefore subject to analysis under the Ex Post Facto Clause.

The Court concluded that the statute created \"only the most speculative and attenuated possibility of producing the prohibited effect of increasing the measure of punishment for covered crimes,\" and held that these \"conjectural effects\" were insufficient to animate the Ex Post Facto Clause.

First, the statute applied only to \"a class of prisoners for whom the likelihood of release on parole is quite remote.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at ----, </a></span>115 S.Ct. at 1603.   Second, the statute cabined the parole board's discretion by requiring it to make a specific finding that a particular prisoner was unlikely to be paroled.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>   Third, the </span>statute only applied to those who were denied parole eligibility the first time around, thus restricting the affected class to those least likely to be found suitable for parole.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>   Finally, though </span>the statute addressed the frequency of suitability hearings, it empowered the board to \"tailor the frequency of subsequent suitability hearings to the particular circumstances of the individual prisoner.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  The Court </span>also noted that \"the possibility of immediate release after a finding of suitability for parole is largely theoretical;  in many cases, the prisoner's parole release date comes at least several years after a finding of suitability,\" and so \"the practical effect of a hearing postponement is not significant.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (citation and </span>internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At bottom, Morales is about the risk or likelihood of harm:  the Court upheld the California statute largely because it found the risk of increased punishment posed by the new law to be speculative and, at any rate, to fall within acceptably small boundaries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Viewed against this backdrop, Hamm's case founders.  Though the parole scheme in effect in 1968 may have afforded him the possibility of terminating his incarceration as early as 1995 if a series of events materialized, it seems highly unlikely that these events would have come to pass.  The likelihood of harm, therefore, is tiny.  And, moreover, it is at least equally possible that, because of the structural differences imposed by the two policies, Hamm may well have languished in prison longer under the old scheme than under the new.  On balance, then, it is virtually impossible to prognosticate the risk that the petitioner may be released at a later date because the 1977 policy rather than its predecessor, controls in his case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the original policy, unless the petitioner managed to obtain parole in 1983 and thereafter amassed all possible credits, he would still have to be paroled a second time in order to be released as early as 1995, or, alternatively, to garner every conceivable credit in order to attain a wrap-up date in October of 2000.  The record is bereft of any evidence suggesting that Hamm would probably achieve prompt parole into his from-and-after sentences, become a model prisoner, go on to earn all available credits, and then be paroled out of, or otherwise released from, his from-and-after sentences at any time before 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  In fine, this case, like Morales, involves a situation in which the possibility of harm is entirely speculative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case also possesses a further dimension that weighs against the petitioner's position.  Whereas the new law in Morales could not conceivably have inured to a prisoner's benefit, the new aggregation policy that the Commonwealth adopted in 1977 might very well redound to the petitioner's advantage.  After all, the 1977 policy eliminates the need for two parole permits and ensures that the petitioner will be eligible for parole from all his sentences at one fell swoop.  Under the old policy, if the respondent denied the petitioner parole into his from-and-after sentences in 1983, 1986, and 1989--not an unlikely eventuality in light of Hamm's mottled record--his wrap-up date, even assuming the accrual of all conceivable credits, would not occur until sometime in 2006.  This is a full five years after the date on which he could be paroled from all his sentences under the 1977 policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This scenario prompted the district court to conclude that \"[i]n 1982, when the respondent recalculated the petitioner's parole eligibility, it was not clear whether the petitioner would be helped or harmed by aggregation; the balance sheet is unclear even today.\"  Hamm III, slip op. at 10.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  This statement is unarguably accurate, and the uncertainty that it portends strips the veneer of plausibility from the petitioner's ex post facto initiative.  Morales makes it crystal clear that such uncertainty militates against the petitioner because any other approach would \"effectively shift[ ] to the State the burden of persuasion as to [the prisoner's] ex post facto claim.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> --- U.S. </span>at ---- n. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">6,</span> <span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The amendment eliminated a twelve-month minimum sentence for the offense of conviction and replaced it with a range of twenty-one to twenty-four months.  The district court imposed the maximum twenty-four-month sentence.  The defendant appealed, claiming that the amendment violated the ex post facto prohibition because it removed the possibility of a shorter sentence, i.e., a sentence of between twelve and twenty-one months.  The Seventh Circuit disagreed.  It noted that, although the amendment eliminated an opportunity for a milder sentence, it also placed a ceiling on the maximum available sentence, thus narrowing \"the range of punishment to [the defendant's] benefit.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"700483\"><a href=\"/opinion/700483/united-states-v-william-mcgee/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1271. </a></span>  This potential benefit made an evaluation of the risk that the new law might subject the prisoner to harsher punishment too speculative to constitute an ex post facto violation.

Due to the peculiar concatenation of circumstances--especially the profound uncertainty over how the petitioner would have fared under the old system and the potential benefits that may accrue to him under the new regime--the potential risk of more Draconian punishment under the 1977 policy defies reliable measurement.

First, I believe that the 1977 aggregation policy, which effectively altered the date of Hamm's initial parole hearing, is a \"law\" subject to ex post facto limitations.  Second, contrary to my colleagues, I believe that the 1977 policy, as applied to Hamm and other similarly-situated prisoners, clearly produces a risk of increasing the measure of punishment sufficient to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.

A court should ask (1) whether the challenged provision is a \"law\" that acts retrospectively, and (2) whether the burden the law retrospectively imposes is of sufficient type and degree to violate the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Hamm argues that the 1977 aggregation policy violated the Ex Post Facto Clause by retroactively depriving him of opportunities to obtain his release earlier than November 2001.  In response, the Commonwealth contends that the 1977 aggregation policy was not a \"law\" subject to ex post facto limitation, and that, in any event, the aggregation did not increase Hamm's punishment.  My colleagues agree with the second contention, and therefore find it unnecessary to consider the first.  Because, as I explain more fully infra at 961-964, I believe that the 1977 aggregation policy engendered a sufficient risk of increasing Hamm's punishment, I cannot avoid the first prong of the Commonwealth's argument.  Accordingly, I proceed first to explore fully whether the 1977 aggregation policy is a \"law\" subject to ex post facto proscription, and, second, to discuss my disagreement with the majority over whether the new policy produces a risk of increasing the measure of punishment sufficient to violate the Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p>A.

Although the aggregation policy was not formally promulgated as a regulation governing the Parole Board, it was as binding on the Parole Board, on a case-by-case basis, as an act passed by the legislature would have been.  Moreover, the Commonwealth does not argue that, once the policy had been promulgated, the Parole Board had any discretion to deviate from the policy in any particular instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has not addressed the question of whether an administrative policy or regulation can be an ex post facto law.  A number of circuit courts, however, have held that binding administrative regulations, as opposed to those that serve merely as guidelines for discretionary decisionmaking, are laws subject to ex post facto limitation.  For example, in a case factually similar to this one, the Ninth Circuit held that the California Department of Corrections's recalculation of a prisoner's parole-eligibility date under its new interpretation of the governing statutes violated the Ex Post Facto Clause because \"the Department has changed its interpretation of the authority itself.\"  Love v.

The Commonwealth makes no claim that its aggregation policy was merely \"advisory\" or that it was free to disregard the policy in a particular case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth does postulate, however, that because it had discretion to adopt the 1977 aggregation policy in the first place and to modify the policy subsequently, as it did in 1988, the policy should not be considered a law.  Although a number of the federal Parole Commission cases have relied in part on this reasoning,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> see, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524096\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Smith,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/524096/charles-f-smith-v-united-states-parole-commission-us-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1367</span></a></span>, I would reject it here.  The argument not only exalts form over substance but its logic suggests that even legislative acts, because they too may be modified, should be immune to challenge under the Ex Post Facto Clause.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566051\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Bailey,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/566051/clark-a-bailey-v-sandra-gardebring-commissioner-of-human-services-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1158</span> </a></span>(Lay, C.J., dissenting).  A binding policy or regulation, promulgated pursuant to delegated legislative authority by an administrative body that implicitly retains authority to amend it in the future, is no different in its force and effect than a law passed by a legislature that retains authority to amend or revoke that law.  The Commonwealth's Parole Board possessed delegated legislative authority to promulgate the aggregation policy:  \"The parole board shall ... make rules relative to the performance of its duties.\"   Mass.Gen.L. ch. 27, Sec. 5(e).  Furthermore, under Massachusetts law, an agency regulation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> \"promulgated pursuant to a legislative grant of power generally [has] the force of law.\"  Kenney v.

My colleagues answer this question in the negative, basing their conclusion on two premises.  First they deem it highly unlikely that, under the prior policy, Hamm would have won early parole from his life sentence and acquired the necessary good-time credits to advance the date of his ultimate parole hearing to a point earlier than 2001.  Hence, they conclude that any harm to Hamm ensuing from the 1977 aggregation policy is highly speculative.  Second, they posit that, due to structural differences between the two policies, a \"real\" benefit accrues to Hamm under the new policy.  Then, combining these two premises, my colleagues ultimately conclude that, on balance, the 1977 aggregation policy does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.

The amendment had no effect on any prisoner unless the California parole board first found that the prisoner was both unsuitable for parole and unlikely to be found suitable at subsequent hearings during the deferral period.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at ----, </a></span>115 S.Ct. at 1604.   Moreover, the Court noted that the amendment did not affect \"the date of any prisoner's initial parole suitability hearing:  it affected the timing only of subsequent hearings.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at ----, </a></span>115 S.Ct. at 1605.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the Court observed, inter alia, that, even with respect to a prisoner who might have actually received a favorable recommendation at an omitted hearing, the practical effect of the amendment on that prisoner's ultimate release date was only slight.  Morales, at <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">----,</span> <span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> at <span class=\"page\">1605</span></span>.   At the deferred hearings, the parole board determined only a prisoner's \"suitability\" for parole but did not set actual parole dates.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  The Court </span>noted that, significantly, in many cases, an actual parole date comes several years after a finding of suitability.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  Moreover, under </span>California law, evidence that a prisoner in fact had been \"suitable\" for a year or two prior to the date of the prisoner's delayed hearing would be relevant in setting the prisoner's actual parole date.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  Hence, the </span>Court concluded that, in most cases, any delay resulting from the amendment could be corrected by the parole board when it set the prisoner's ultimate release date.

Furthermore, the Court carefully limited the breadth of its holding, expressly disavowing any opinion \"as to the constitutionality of any of a number of statutes that might alter the timing of parole hearings under circumstances different from those present here.\"  Morales, at ----, n. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">6,</span> <span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

First, in contrast to the Morales amendment, the adoption of the 1977 aggregation policy potentially affects all Massachusetts prisoners previously eligible for parole from a life sentence into consecutive from-and-after sentences.  No provision in the policy limits the class of affected prisoners to only those adjudged by the Commonwealth's Parole Board (or some similar body) to be unlikely to win early parole or to earn significant good-time credits.  Moreover, where the Morales amendment affected only subsequent hearings, the 1977 aggregation policy essentially delays an affected prisoner's initial parole hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, also in contrast to Morales, the impact of the 1977 aggregation policy on those it affects is substantial.  For example, under the prior policy, Hamm could have terminated his incarceration as early as 1995, through the acquisition of earned and statutory good-time credits and the application of his jail credits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  The 1977 aggregation policy extinguished that possibility;  Hamm's term of incarceration cannot end under the 1977 policy before his first-available parole hearing in 2001.  Thus, in contrast to the amendment in Morales, which will have little, if any, real impact on an affected prisoner's actual time in prison, the 1977 aggregation policy could potentially increase Hamm's prison term by up to six years.

Such analysis, however, is more akin to a harmless error inquiry focusing on the particulars of Hamm's case than to a proper ex post facto inquiry into whether the new law posed a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment.

Moreover, notwithstanding my colleagues' post hoc evaluation of Hamm's chances, because Hamm never received a parole hearing, no findings exist to inform us whether or not the Commonwealth would have found Hamm to be a likely candidate for early parole from his life sentence.  Indeed, without such findings or even knowledge concerning the standards and policies that guide the Commonwealth's Parole Board in making such recommendations, this court can only speculate as to whether the 1977 aggregation policy posed a sufficient risk to Hamm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Morales, the Court reasoned that the delay in parole suitability hearings caused by the challenged amendment did not produce a sufficient risk of punishment because, in major part, the amendment affected only a carefully limited class of prisoners, and the impact of any delay on an affected prisoner's actual time in prison was negligible.  Implicit in the Court's holding, however, is the recognition that delay in a parole hearing produces some possibility of an increase in punishment.  Where, as here, the delay is not predicated on a finding that the prisoner is an unlikely candidate for parole, and the delay may significantly increase the prisoner's sentence, I believe, even in Hamm's case, such delay produces a \"sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment.\"  Morales, --- U.S. at <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">----,</span> <span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

I believe, however, that it is this putative \"benefit\" that is too \"speculative\" to merit significant weight in the ex post facto inquiry.  Any fair analysis reveals that the supposed benefit arising from the 1977 aggregation policy assumes several rather contradictory predicates.  For example, to find that Hamm would benefit from the 1977 policy, I would need to assume both (1) that, under the prior policy, the Commonwealth's Parole Board would have refused to grant Hamm parole from his life sentence at least three times (in 1983, 1986, and 1989), or that, if the board did grant him such initial parole, he would have subsequently failed to accrue good-time credits, and (2) that, under the new policy, the Parole Board would then grant him \"real\" parole into society at large in 2001 (notwithstanding that the board would not even have granted Hamm parole from his life sentence into his lengthy from-and-after sentences on at least three prior occasions).  In other words, the Parole Board would have to deny Hamm's request for parole from one lengthy sentence into another at least three times, but then, a short time later, be willing essentially to grant Hamm a complete release from prison.  The inherent contradiction in such assumptions discloses the difficulty of quantifying such a \"benefit,\" or even determining whether one genuinely exists.  Thus, I believe that any benefit engendered by the 1977 aggregation policy is much too speculative to serve as an effective counterweight to its real risk of harm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, I believe that the 1977 aggregation policy is a \"law\" subject to ex post facto limitation, and that the policy produces a risk of increasing the measure of punishment sufficient to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution.

The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing and found, on the basis of the petitioner's prison records and testimony from former and current counsel to the Parole Board, that prior to 1977 the respondent did in fact follow a practice of providing fifteen-year parole hearings to life prisoners facing from-and-after sentences.

We need not probe the point too deeply, however, inasmuch as the Commonwealth has not disputed the petitioner's contention that his parole-eligibility date under the 1977 aggregation policy is in November of 2001.

The dissent's mechanical approach not only ignores this admonition but also overlooks Morales 's central holding, namely, that a proper ex post facto inquiry must focus on the risk that the prisoner will be subject to an increased measure of punishment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> If past is prologue, cf. W. Shakespeare, The Tempest, act II, sc. i (1612), all of these prospects seem extremely dubious.  Hamm's disciplinary record reveals a cavalcade of misconduct, including episodes of inciting a prison riot, arson, assaulting a guard, attempting an escape, conspiring to take a hostage, organizing a work stoppage, and possessing controlled substances.  These are not the emblemata of an inmate who is likely either to inspire a parole board to act favorably on his behalf or to accumulate good-time credits at a rapid rate</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> There are, of course, other similarities to Morales.   We mention two of them.  First, the challenged policy here--like the statute at issue in Morales, at <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">----,</span> <span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> at <span class=\"page\">1603</span></span>--applies only to a limited class of prisoners (here, life inmates who face the overhanging prospect of from-and-after sentences) for whom the likelihood of release on parole is considerably below the norm.  Second, the availability of special parole, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> supra </span>Part I(C)(3), offers the Parole Board the flexibility that the Morales Court deemed important.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at ----</a></span>, 115 S.Ct. at 1604</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> The Morales Court pointed out that the relevant inquiry must not focus \"on whether a legislative change produces some ambiguous sort of 'disadvantage,' ... but on whether any such change ... increases the penalty by which a crime is punishable.\"  Morales, --- U.S. at ---- n. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">3,</span> <span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> at <span class=\"page\">1602</span> </span>n. 3.   Despite the fact that the district court issued its opinion without the benefit of Morales and framed the corresponding part of its ruling as an inquiry into whether the 1977 policy resulted in a \"[d]isadvantage to the petitioner,\" it nonetheless made a thoroughgoing examination of the uncertainty inherent in comparing potential results under the old and new policies</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> I do not restate the facts or outline the prior proceedings.  For a complete discussion of these matters, see Majority Opinion at 949-953</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> The Commonwealth claims that the Eighth Circuit adopted this reasoning in Bailey, which held that a change in Minnesota parole board regulations abolishing annual review of prospective release dates and limiting the board's discretion in changing such dates did not constitute a law for ex post facto purposes, even though the board lacked discretion to disregard its regulations in any given case.  However, the relevant section of <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566051\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Bailey,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/566051/clark-a-bailey-v-sandra-gardebring-commissioner-of-human-services-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1156</span></a></span>, drew the concurrence of a second panel member as to the result only, and not its reasoning, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566051\"><a href=\"/opinion/566051/clark-a-bailey-v-sandra-gardebring-commissioner-of-human-services-and/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1157 </a></span>(Stuart, J., concurring)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> That the 1977 policy was not formally deemed a \"regulation\" also does not seem to matter:  Under Massachusetts law, a \"regulation\"</p>\n        <p>includes the whole or any part of every rule, regulation, standard or other requirement of general application and future effect ... adopted by an agency to implement or interpret the law enforced or administered by it.</p>\n        <p>Mass.Gen.L. ch. 30A, Sec. 1(5) (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> As does the majority, I assume the accuracy of Hamm's claim of entitlement to 840 days of jail credit.  See Majority at 952.  I note, however, that the claim is not critical to my analysis.  Even without the 840 days, the 1977 aggregation policy deprives Hamm of the opportunity to advance his initial ultimate parole date by over three and half years</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> The fact that the record lacks the opinion, much less the findings, of the Commonwealth's Parole Board on Hamm's suitability for early parole clearly underscores the inappropriateness of my colleagues' \"harmless error\" style review</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> My colleagues find further support in the Seventh Circuit's recent decision in United States v. McGee, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"700483\"><a href=\"/opinion/700483/united-states-v-william-mcgee/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1266</span></a></span>, 1271 (7th Cir.1995).  In McGee, the Seventh Circuit rejected an ex post facto challenge to a sentencing provision that substituted a mandatory range of 21 to 24 months in place of an open-ended 12 month minimum sentence for the offense of conviction.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"700483\"><a href=\"/opinion/700483/united-states-v-william-mcgee/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  I find </a></span>the analogy inapt because in McGee the district court had actually sentenced the defendant to the maximum 24 months under the new sentencing range prior to the Seventh Circuit's review.  Thus, the Seventh Court could fairly quantify both the benefit and the harm produced by the new sentencing range.  Significantly, the fact that the district court had sentenced the defendant to the maximum possible under the new sentencing scheme clearly suggested that, if anything, it would have given the defendant a higher, not lesser, sentence under the old scheme.  In our case, however, Hamm received no analogous treatment.  He received no parole hearing.  Thus, instead of fairly quantifying the risk as the McGee court did, we can only speculate as to the effect the 1977 aggregation policy will ultimately have on his sentence</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
