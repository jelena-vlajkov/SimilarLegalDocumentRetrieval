On May 8, 1991, while\n\nstill working for BHA, Seifart became disabled.   In November\n\nof that  year, Seifart  applied to  the  Fund for  disability\n\npension.

Under  that\n\nprovision, a  participant may retire on  a disability pension\n\nif:\n\n          He  has  become disabled,  as hereinafter\n          defined,  after  he  has  accumulated  at\n          least  10 Pension  Credits or  10 Vesting\n          Credits, which may  include a maximum  of\n          one Pension Credit  or one Vesting Credit\n          granted  under  Section  4.01(c)(II),  of\n          which  140 hours  of such  Pension Credit\n          was  accumulated  in the  36-month period\n          prior to the date of disability.\n\n          Under the provisions of  the Plan, Seifart  accrued\n\nvesting credits, but not pension credits, for his years  with\n\nBHA.    Accordingly,  Seifart  argues, he  has  16.9  vesting\n\ncredits -- a point conceded by Skane in his brief -- and thus\n\nqualifies  under the  language of  the Plan.    Skane argues,\n\nhowever, that section 3.10(b) sets out a two-prong test:  (1)\n\na  participant  must  accumulate  the  requisite  pension  or\n\nvesting credits, and  (2) 140 hours  of pension credits  must\n\nhave  been earned within  the thirty-six months  prior to the\n\ndate  of disability.1    Skane argues  that, because  Seifart\n\nearned no pension credits while working for the BHA, he fails\n\nthe second prong.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  The   district  court  apparently   agreed  with  Skane's\ninterpretation of the Plan's language.\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          We think Skane's reading  flies in the face  of the\n\nplain  language of the Plan.   Under the  Plan, a participant\n\nmay  qualify for  disability  retirement benefits  by earning\n\npension  credits  or   vesting  credits;  if   a  participant\r                                \n\nqualifies  by means  of  pension credits,  then the  140-hour\n\nrequirement obtains.   Here,  the parties agree  that Seifart\n\nhas earned more than ten vesting credits.  Under the language\n\nof the Plan, then, Seifart qualifies without reference to the\n\npension credit requirements.\n\n          Interpreting a contract in a manner contrary to its\n\nclear  language is arbitrary  and capricious.   See, e.g., De\r                                                                         \n\nNobel  v. Vitro Corp., 885  F.2d 1180, 1188  (4th Cir. 1989).\r                                 \n\nSkane did just that in this case, and accordingly, we reverse\n\nthe decision of the district court.   That said, we note that\n\nthe district court appears to have addressed this case on the\n\npremise   that  the  140-hour   requirement  applied  to  the\n\nappellant.  There is  even a trace of this assumption  in the\n\nappellant's  brief on  appeal,  and the  appellee takes  this\n\nposition   for   granted.      We  find   the   purpose   and\n\ninterconnection  of  the  pertinent  provisions  difficult to\n\ndiscern.   We have decided this case in light of what appears\n\nto us to be the plain language of the plan, but the fact that\n\nthe parties have not discussed the seemingly crucial language\n\non which  we base our holding  leads us to  invite a petition\n\nfor reconsideration if  there is some reason why the language\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nshould be taken to mean something that it does  not appear to\n\nsay.\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \n\n          For  the  foregoing reasons,  the  decision of  the\n\ndistrict court is\n\n          reversed.\r                      reversed.\r                              \n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n",

Under  that\n\nprovision, a  participant may retire on  a disability pension\n\nif:\n\n          He  has  become disabled,  as hereinafter\n          defined,  after  he  has  accumulated  at\n          least  10 Pension  Credits or  10 Vesting\n          Credits, which may  include a maximum  of\n          one Pension Credit  or one Vesting Credit\n          granted  under  Section  4.01(c)(II),  of\n          which  140 hours  of such  Pension Credit\n          was  accumulated  in the  36-month period\n          prior to the date of disability.\n\n          Under the provisions of  the Plan, Seifart  accrued\n\nvesting credits, but not pension credits, for his years  with\n\nBHA.    Accordingly,  Seifart  argues, he  has  16.9  vesting\n\ncredits -- a point conceded by Skane in his brief -- and thus\n\nqualifies  under the  language of  the Plan.    Skane argues,\n\nhowever, that section 3.10(b) sets out a two-prong test:  (1)\n\na  participant  must  accumulate  the  requisite  pension  or\n\nvesting credits, and  (2) 140 hours  of pension credits  must\n\nhave  been earned within  the thirty-six months  prior to the\n\ndate  of disability.1    Skane argues  that, because  Seifart\n\nearned no pension credits while working for the BHA, he fails\n\nthe second prong.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  The   district  court  apparently   agreed  with  Skane's\ninterpretation of the Plan's language.\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          We think Skane's reading  flies in the face  of the\n\nplain  language of the Plan.   Under the  Plan, a participant\n\nmay  qualify for  disability  retirement benefits  by earning\n\npension  credits  or   vesting  credits;  if   a  participant\r                                \n\nqualifies  by means  of  pension credits,  then the  140-hour\n\nrequirement obtains.   Here,  the parties agree  that Seifart\n\nhas earned more than ten vesting credits.  Under the language\n\nof the Plan, then, Seifart qualifies without reference to the\n\npension credit requirements.\n\n          Interpreting a contract in a manner contrary to its\n\nclear  language is arbitrary  and capricious.   See, e.g., De\r                                                                         \n\nNobel  v.

That said, we note that\n\nthe district court appears to have addressed this case on the\n\npremise   that  the  140-hour   requirement  applied  to  the\n\nappellant.  There is  even a trace of this assumption  in the\n\nappellant's  brief on  appeal,  and the  appellee takes  this\n\nposition   for   granted.      We  find   the   purpose   and\n\ninterconnection  of  the  pertinent  provisions  difficult to\n\ndiscern.   We have decided this case in light of what appears\n\nto us to be the plain language of the plan, but the fact that\n\nthe parties have not discussed the seemingly crucial language\n\non which  we base our holding  leads us to  invite a petition\n\nfor reconsideration if  there is some reason why the language\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nshould be taken to mean something that it does  not appear to\n\nsay.\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \n\n          For  the  foregoing reasons,  the  decision of  the\n\ndistrict court is\n\n          reversed.\r                      reversed.\r                              \n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n</pre>",
