IBC claims that the district court committed reversible\n\nerror when  it denied IBC's  Rule 50  motions for  judgment as  a\n\nmatter of law.  IBC also contends that the lower court improperly\n\nexercised  supplemental  jurisdiction  over  claims  arising from\n\nPuerto Rico Laws  3 and 100.  Finally, IBC  claims that the lower\n\ncourt erred  in awarding compensatory damages  and excessive back\n\npay.  For the following reasons we affirm the court below.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Appellee,  Vera,  filed  a  complaint  with  the  Anti-\n\nDiscrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor (UAD),\n\nalleging employment  discrimination under Title VII  of the Civil\n\nRights Act  of 1964.  She  duly notified the  Appellant, IBC, who\n\ndid  not respond at that  time. The UAD  determined that probable\n\ncause  existed  for  a  discrimination  suit  based  on  sex  and\n\npregnancy.\n\n          The  complaint in the action below was filed on June 2,\n\n1992, in the  United States  District Court for  the District  of\n\nPuerto Rico.   The complaint  alleged claims arising  under Title\n\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.    2000e, et seq.,\r                                                                          \n\nand invoked the court's  supplemental jurisdiction to hear claims\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\narising under Puerto Rico Law 3, 29 P.R.L.A.   467,  et seq., and\r                                                                      \n\nLaw 100, as amended, 29 P.R.L.A.   146, et seq.  Jurisdiction was\r                                                         \n\nexercised pursuant to 28 U.S.C.    1331, 2201 and 2202.\n\n          Vera was a full-time  master control operator for Three\n\nStar  Telecast  Corp.  (Three  Star), which  owned  and  operated\n\nChannel 18 from  1984 until December  21, 1990, when  the station\n\nwas  taken over  by IBC.   The master control  unit regulates the\n\nreceiving and  broadcasting of  television transmissions.   There\n\nwere six master  control operators  at Three Star;  Vera was  the\n\nmost senior.\n\n          Pedro  Rom n-Collazo   was   at  all   relevant   times\n\nPresident, General  Manager, and owner  of IBC.   During  Rom n's\n\ntenure,  IBC purchased the permit  to broadcast on  Channel 18 as\n\nwell as other assets of  Three Star Telecast.  Grisel Torres,  an\n\nemployee of IBC, became the general manager of Channel 18.\n\n          On December 21, 1990, the last  day Three Star operated\n\nChannel  18, it laid  off twenty employees,  retaining only four.\n\nThe new  owner assured the  dismissed former employees  that they\n\nwould be rehired.   In fact, several days prior  to the takeover,\n\nTorres, instructed Philbert Modeste, who had been retained by IBC\n\nto continue as the engineer in charge of the master control unit,\n\nto prepare a  list of  three former  Three Star  employees to  be\n\nhired.  That list included Vera.  Modeste testified at trial that\n\nwhen he submitted the list to  Torres, she told him that Vera was\n\nnot eligible because \"she was going to have a baby.\"\n\n          Vera  gave  birth  on  January  22,  1991.    In  early\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nFebruary,  she went to Modeste  seeking employment.   He told her\n\nthat he would contact  Torres about a possible position  for her.\n\nIBC,  however, never  contacted  Vera despite  the fact  that the\n\ncompany  was seeking a master  control operator.  Vera discovered\n\nthat  an opening existed  at IBC from  a newspaper advertisement.\n\nIn response to this advertisement,  Vera again contacted Modeste.\n\nAgain, he  asked her  to resubmit  her resume. IBC  did not  hire\n\nVera.  Instead, the position was filled by a man, Pablo Mart nez,\n\nwho had never worked for Three Star.\n\n                       II.  RULE 50 MOTION\r                                 II.  RULE 50 MOTION\n\n          IBC  made a Rule 50 motion for  judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw at  the close of Vera's  case.  IBC  alleged that it  was not\n\ncovered by Title VII because it did not have the requisite number\n\nof employees.   This motion  was renewed  after the close  of the\n\ndefendant's case.\n\n          Title  VII of  the Civil  Rights Act  of 1964  makes it\n\nunlawful for  an employer to discriminate against  an employee on\n\naccount of  gender or pregnancy.  See 42 U.S.C.    2000e-2.   For\r                                               \n\nthe purposes of that  statute \"employer\" is defined as  \"a person\n\nengaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more\n\nemployees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar\n\nweeks in the current  or preceding calendar year.\"   42 U.S.C.   \n\n2000e.   Since  IBC did not  own the  assets of  Three Star until\n\nDecember  21, 1990, IBC cannot  be an employer  for that calendar\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nyear.\n\n          Section 2000e-2  makes it unlawful for  an employer \"to\n\nfail  or  refuse  to hire  or  to  discharge  any individual,  or\n\notherwise discriminate against  any individual .  . . because  of\n\nsuch  individual's  . .  . sex.\"     The  record shows  that Vera\n\nreapplied for her former position of master control unit operator\n\non  two separate occasions in  1991.  IBC's  denial of employment\n\nwas  ongoing during  that  time.   The  \"current year\"  then,  as\n\ndefined by  the statute,  is 1991.   See Dumas  v. Town  of Mount\r                                                                           \n\nVernon, Ala., 612 F.2d 974, 979 n.4 (5th Cir. 1980).\r                      \n\n          IBC  argues that part-time  employees should be counted\n\nas employees for a given week only if they actually work all five\n\ndays of that  week.   We considered this  question in Thurber  v.\r                                                                       \n\nJack Reilly's Inc., 717 F.2d  633 (1st Cir. 1983), and found  the\r                            \n\nlaw  in this  circuit to  be to  the contrary.   In  Thurber, the\r                                                                      \n\ndefendant was a small  bar in Cambridge, Massachusetts.   See id.\r                                                                          \n\nAlthough  the defendant  had  only nine  full-time employees,  at\n\nleast  fifteen employees were on the payroll for more than twenty\n\nweeks during the relevant calendar year.  See id. at 634.  On any\r                                                           \n\ngiven day, only eleven of these employees reported for work.  See\r                                                                           \n\nid.   We  concluded that  the defendant  was an employer  for the\r            \n\npurposes of  Title VII.  See  id.  We reasoned  that the relevant\r                                          \n\nemployees  were not only those who were physically present at the\n\nbar  each  day,  but all  those  who  had  an ongoing  employment\n\nrelationship with the employer during the requisite twenty weeks.\n\nSee id. (citing Pedreyra  v. Cornell Prescription Pharmacies, 465\r                                                                      \n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nF. Supp.  936, 941 (D.Colo. 1979);  Hornick v. Borough of Duryea,\r                                                                          \n\n507 F. Supp. 1091, 1097 (M.D.Pa. 1980)).\n\n          This  reasoning  is persuasive  especially in  light of\n\nTitle  VII's legislative  history.   While  Congress did  express\n\nconcern for  the over-regulation of small  businesses, it appears\n\nto   have  adopted   the  definition   of  \"employer\"   from  the\n\nUnemployment Tax  Act.  See 100 Cong. Rec. S13087 (daily ed. June\r                                     \n\n9, 1964)  (statement of  Sen. Dirksen).  An  employee is  counted\n\nunder that statute  for each day that  an employment relationship\n\nexists regardless  of whether the employee reported  to work each\n\nday.   See  Rev. Rule  55-19, 1955-1 C.B.  496.   As we  noted in\r                    \n\nThurber, although it  is true that such a  reading of the statute\r                 \n\nmay  bring  within its  ambit a  number  of truly  \"Mom  and Pop\"\n\nestablishments,  the burden on  these businesses  would not  be a\n\nconsiderable  one;  simply put, they could not discriminate.  See\r                                                                           \n\nThurber at 635.\r                 \n\n          Counting both part-time and full-time  employees on the\n\npayroll during 1991,  there is sufficient evidence  on the record\n\nin the  form of testimony  of Vera  and Rom n to  support finding\n\nthat  IBC was  an employer  as defined  by Title  VII.   For this\n\nreason we find  that the district court's  denial of the  Rule 50\n\nmotions was not in error.\n\n                 III.  SUPPLEMENTAL JURISDICTION\r                           III.  SUPPLEMENTAL JURISDICTION\n\n          IBC   contends  that  the   district  court  improperly\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nexercised supplemental jurisdiction over the claims arising under\n\nthe Puerto Rico statutes.\n\n          In  1990,  Congress enacted  28  U.S.C.    1367,  which\n\ngranted  federal courts \"supplemental  jurisdiction\" or  what had\n\nformerly  been   referred  to  as   \"pendent  jurisdiction\"   and\n\n\"ancillary jurisdiction.\"  This section states that \"in any civil\n\naction over which the district courts have original jurisdiction,\n\nthe district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all\n\nother claims that  are so related to  claims in the action  . . .\n\nthat they form part of the same case and controversy.\"  28 U.S.C.\n\n  1367 (1993).\n\n          This statute  codified the Supreme  Court's analysis in\n\nUnited Mine Workers v.  Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715 (1966).  See Sinclair\r                                                                           \n\nv. Soniform,  Inc., 935 F.2d 599, 603 (3d Cir. 1991);  Bridges v.\r                                                                        \n\nEastman  Kodak Co., 800 F. Supp. 1172, 1178 (S.D.N.Y. 1992).  The\r                            \n\nCourt  stated  in  Gibbs  that  a   federal  court  may  exercise\r                                  \n\nsupplemental  jurisdiction  over a  state  claim  whenever it  is\n\njoined  with a  federal claim and  the two claims  \"derive from a\n\ncommon  nucleus  of  operative  fact\" and  the  plaintiff  \"would\n\nordinarily  be  expected  to  try   them  both  in  one  judicial\n\nproceeding.\"   Gibbs, 383  U.S. at  725;   Brown  v. Trustees  of\r                                                                           \n\nBoston University, 891  F.2d 337, 356  (1st Cir.), cert.  denied,\r                                                                          \n\n496  U.S.  937  (1989).   The  statute  expressly  states that  a\n\ndistrict court  may refuse to  exercise this jurisdiction  if the\n\nstate claim \"substantially predominates  over the claim or claims\n\nover  which the district court has original jurisdiction\" or \"the\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nclaim  raises a novel or complex issue  of state law.\"  28 U.S.C.\n\n   3567(c)(1), (c)(2).\n\n          IBC does not dispute that the federal and  state claims\n\narise out of the same set of facts.   IBC's only argument is that\n\nthe   district  court   abused   its  discretion   in  exercising\n\njurisdiction  over the  state claims  because the  state statutes\n\nhave different standards of  proof and may therefore  confuse the\n\njury.\n\n          Because the  decision whether to  exercise supplemental\n\njurisdiction is  left to  the  broad discretion  of the  district\n\ncourt, this decision will be disturbed only upon finding an abuse\n\nof discretion.  See Newman v. Burgin, 930 F.2d 955, 963 (1st Cir.\r                                              \n\n1991);  McCaffrey v. Rex Motor Transport, Inc., 672 F.2d 250 (1st\r                                                        \n\nCir. 1982).   Here there  is clearly  no such abuse:   the  state\n\nclaims do not predominate; Vera points to no novel issue of state\n\nlaw;  and  joint adjudication  serves  the  interest of  judicial\n\neconomy  and fairness.  We therefore find that the district court\n\nproperly exercised supplemental jurisdiction.\n\n                         IV.  JURY TRIAL\r                                   IV.  JURY TRIAL\n\n          IBC claims that the district court committed reversible\n\nerror when  it tried the case before a jury.  The Constitution of\n\nPuerto Rico does not afford litigants in a civil action the right\n\nto trial by jury.  IBC contends therefore that the district court\n\nerred  in allowing a jury to determine facts needed to decide the\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nclaims arising under the laws of Puerto Rico.\n\n          This  claim is without merit.  It is well accepted that\n\nthe  Seventh Amendment  affords  litigants in  federal courts  in\n\nPuerto  Rico the right to trial by jury, notwithstanding the fact\n\nthat the Constitution of Puerto Rico does not allow for juries in\n\ncivil cases.   See Marshall  v.

DAMAGES\n\n          IBC maintains  that the  trial court erred  by allowing\n\nthe jury to  award compensatory  damages based  on a  retroactive\n\napplication  of the  Civil  Rights Act  of  1991.   However,  the\n\nverdict  form  correctly allowed  for  an  award of  compensatory\n\ndamages based on the  violation of either federal or  Puerto Rico\r                                                   \n\nlaw.   Because the jury's  finding that IBC  violated Puerto Rico\n\nlaw would  alone support the  award of compensatory  damages, the\n\nsubmission  of  the  claim based  on  the  Civil  Rights Act,  if\n\nincorrect,  was  harmless  error  and will  not  be  disturbed on\n\nappeal.   See Shepp v. Uehlinger, 775  F.2d 452, 456-57 (1st Cir.\r                                          \n\n1985);   see also  Gillentine v. McKeand, 426  F.2d 717, 724 (1st\r                                                  \n\nCir. 1970).\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          IBC also  complains that the amount  of damages awarded\n\nfor  back pay is  not supported by  the evidence.   IBC failed to\n\nraise this issue  in the court below either during  trial or in a\n\npost-verdict  motion to set-aside the verdict.  As a general rule\n\na Court  of Appeals  will not  consider an  issue raised  for the\n\nfirst  time  on appeal  absent  exceptional  circumstances.   See\r                                                                           \n\nRefuse and Environmental Systems,  Inc. v. Industrial Servs., 932\r                                                                      \n\nF.2d 37,  41 (1st  Cir. 1992);  Mello v.

Here,  there are  no exceptional\n\ncircumstances and thus we consider the issue to be waived.\n\n          Had IBC  properly raised  this issue below,  the result\n\nwould be unchanged.   For the party seeking  to attack the amount\n\nof  jury-awarded damages,  the applicable  standard of  review is\n\ndaunting.  We will not  disturb an award of damages for  economic\n\nloss \"provided it does  not 'violate the conscience of  the court\n\nor strike such  a dissonant  chord that justice  would be  denied\n\nwere the judgment permitted  to stand.'\"  See Havinga  v. Crowley\r                                                                           \n\nTowing  and Transportation  Co.,  24 F.3d  1480,  1489 (1st  Cir.\r                                         \n\n1994)(quoting Milone v.

Goldring, Inc., 694 F.2d 869, 871 (1st Cir. 1982).  Under\r                                \n\nthis  standard the court should \"examine the evidence in detail .\n\n. . and in a light most favorable to the plaintiff.\"  Havinga, 24\r                                                                       \n\nF.3d at 1489.\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n          There  is ample  support in the  record for  the jury's\n\nverdict  as to  back pay.   IBC's  main contention  is  that Vera\n\nfailed to  mitigate her damages  by voluntarily resigning  from a\n\njob as a receptionist in February of 1992.  IBC  claims that back\n\npay  should not be awarded  during the period  beginning with the\n\ndate of her voluntary resignation until the date the judgment was\n\nentered.  We  will not  supplant the jury's  verdict nor  second-\n\nguess  what may  have been  their  thought process  regarding the\n\nvoluntary  nature  of  Vera's   resignation  or  her  efforts  to\n\nmitigate.  This reluctance is especially appropriate in light  of\n\nevidence, in the form of  Vera's testimony, supporting a possible\n\nfinding that the receptionist job provided no additional economic\n\nsupport given the irregular work schedule, the cost of child care\n\nfor her two children and the low pay.\n\n                         VI.  CONCLUSION\r                                   VI.  CONCLUSION\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n",

IBC claims that the district court committed reversible\n\nerror when  it denied IBC's  Rule 50  motions for  judgment as  a\n\nmatter of law.  IBC also contends that the lower court improperly\n\nexercised  supplemental  jurisdiction  over  claims  arising from\n\nPuerto Rico Laws  3 and 100.  Finally, IBC  claims that the lower\n\ncourt erred  in awarding compensatory damages  and excessive back\n\npay.  For the following reasons we affirm the court below.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Appellee,  Vera,  filed  a  complaint  with  the  Anti-\n\nDiscrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor (UAD),\n\nalleging employment  discrimination under Title VII  of the Civil\n\nRights Act  of 1964.  She  duly notified the  Appellant, IBC, who\n\ndid  not respond at that  time. The UAD  determined that probable\n\ncause  existed  for  a  discrimination  suit  based  on  sex  and\n\npregnancy.\n\n          The  complaint in the action below was filed on June 2,\n\n1992, in the  United States  District Court for  the District  of\n\nPuerto Rico.   The complaint  alleged claims arising  under Title\n\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.    2000e, et seq.,\r                                                                          \n\nand invoked the court's  supplemental jurisdiction to hear claims\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\narising under Puerto Rico Law 3, 29 P.R.L.A.   467,  et seq., and\r                                                                      \n\nLaw 100, as amended, 29 P.R.L.A.   146, et seq.  Jurisdiction was\r                                                         \n\nexercised pursuant to 28 U.S.C.    1331, 2201 and 2202.\n\n          Vera was a full-time  master control operator for Three\n\nStar  Telecast  Corp.  (Three  Star), which  owned  and  operated\n\nChannel 18 from  1984 until December  21, 1990, when  the station\n\nwas  taken over  by IBC.   The master control  unit regulates the\n\nreceiving and  broadcasting of  television transmissions.   There\n\nwere six master  control operators  at Three Star;  Vera was  the\n\nmost senior.\n\n          Pedro  Rom n-Collazo   was   at  all   relevant   times\n\nPresident, General  Manager, and owner  of IBC.   During  Rom n's\n\ntenure,  IBC purchased the permit  to broadcast on  Channel 18 as\n\nwell as other assets of  Three Star Telecast.  Grisel Torres,  an\n\nemployee of IBC, became the general manager of Channel 18.\n\n          On December 21, 1990, the last  day Three Star operated\n\nChannel  18, it laid  off twenty employees,  retaining only four.\n\nThe new  owner assured the  dismissed former employees  that they\n\nwould be rehired.   In fact, several days prior  to the takeover,\n\nTorres, instructed Philbert Modeste, who had been retained by IBC\n\nto continue as the engineer in charge of the master control unit,\n\nto prepare a  list of  three former  Three Star  employees to  be\n\nhired.  That list included Vera.  Modeste testified at trial that\n\nwhen he submitted the list to  Torres, she told him that Vera was\n\nnot eligible because \"she was going to have a baby.\"\n\n          Vera  gave  birth  on  January  22,  1991.    In  early\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nFebruary,  she went to Modeste  seeking employment.   He told her\n\nthat he would contact  Torres about a possible position  for her.\n\nIBC,  however, never  contacted  Vera despite  the fact  that the\n\ncompany  was seeking a master  control operator.  Vera discovered\n\nthat  an opening existed  at IBC from  a newspaper advertisement.\n\nIn response to this advertisement,  Vera again contacted Modeste.\n\nAgain, he  asked her  to resubmit  her resume. IBC  did not  hire\n\nVera.  Instead, the position was filled by a man, Pablo Mart nez,\n\nwho had never worked for Three Star.\n\n                       II.  RULE 50 MOTION\r                                 II.  RULE 50 MOTION\n\n          IBC  made a Rule 50 motion for  judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw at  the close of Vera's  case.  IBC  alleged that it  was not\n\ncovered by Title VII because it did not have the requisite number\n\nof employees.   This motion  was renewed  after the close  of the\n\ndefendant's case.\n\n          Title  VII of  the Civil  Rights Act  of 1964  makes it\n\nunlawful for  an employer to discriminate against  an employee on\n\naccount of  gender or pregnancy.  See 42 U.S.C.    2000e-2.   For\r                                               \n\nthe purposes of that  statute \"employer\" is defined as  \"a person\n\nengaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more\n\nemployees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar\n\nweeks in the current  or preceding calendar year.\"   42 U.S.C.   \n\n2000e.   Since  IBC did not  own the  assets of  Three Star until\n\nDecember  21, 1990, IBC cannot  be an employer  for that calendar\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nyear.\n\n          Section 2000e-2  makes it unlawful for  an employer \"to\n\nfail  or  refuse  to hire  or  to  discharge  any individual,  or\n\notherwise discriminate against  any individual .  . . because  of\n\nsuch  individual's  . .  . sex.\"     The  record shows  that Vera\n\nreapplied for her former position of master control unit operator\n\non  two separate occasions in  1991.  IBC's  denial of employment\n\nwas  ongoing during  that  time.   The  \"current year\"  then,  as\n\ndefined by  the statute,  is 1991.   See Dumas  v.

While  Congress did  express\n\nconcern for  the over-regulation of small  businesses, it appears\n\nto   have  adopted   the  definition   of  \"employer\"   from  the\n\nUnemployment Tax  Act.  See 100 Cong. Rec. S13087 (daily ed. June\r                                     \n\n9, 1964)  (statement of  Sen. Dirksen).  An  employee is  counted\n\nunder that statute  for each day that  an employment relationship\n\nexists regardless  of whether the employee reported  to work each\n\nday.   See  Rev. Rule  55-19, 1955-1 C.B.  496.   As we  noted in\r                    \n\nThurber, although it  is true that such a  reading of the statute\r                 \n\nmay  bring  within its  ambit a  number  of truly  \"Mom  and Pop\"\n\nestablishments,  the burden on  these businesses  would not  be a\n\nconsiderable  one;  simply put, they could not discriminate.  See\r                                                                           \n\nThurber at 635.\r                 \n\n          Counting both part-time and full-time  employees on the\n\npayroll during 1991,  there is sufficient evidence  on the record\n\nin the  form of testimony  of Vera  and Rom n to  support finding\n\nthat  IBC was  an employer  as defined  by Title  VII.   For this\n\nreason we find  that the district court's  denial of the  Rule 50\n\nmotions was not in error.\n\n                 III.  SUPPLEMENTAL JURISDICTION\r                           III.

The  statute  expressly  states that  a\n\ndistrict court  may refuse to  exercise this jurisdiction  if the\n\nstate claim \"substantially predominates  over the claim or claims\n\nover  which the district court has original jurisdiction\" or \"the\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nclaim  raises a novel or complex issue  of state law.\"  28 U.S.C.\n\n   3567(c)(1), (c)(2).\n\n          IBC does not dispute that the federal and  state claims\n\narise out of the same set of facts.   IBC's only argument is that\n\nthe   district  court   abused   its  discretion   in  exercising\n\njurisdiction  over the  state claims  because the  state statutes\n\nhave different standards of  proof and may therefore  confuse the\n\njury.\n\n          Because the  decision whether to  exercise supplemental\n\njurisdiction is  left to  the  broad discretion  of the  district\n\ncourt, this decision will be disturbed only upon finding an abuse\n\nof discretion.

Here there  is clearly  no such abuse:   the  state\n\nclaims do not predominate; Vera points to no novel issue of state\n\nlaw;  and  joint adjudication  serves  the  interest of  judicial\n\neconomy  and fairness.

JURY TRIAL\n\n          IBC claims that the district court committed reversible\n\nerror when  it tried the case before a jury.  The Constitution of\n\nPuerto Rico does not afford litigants in a civil action the right\n\nto trial by jury.  IBC contends therefore that the district court\n\nerred  in allowing a jury to determine facts needed to decide the\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nclaims arising under the laws of Puerto Rico.\n\n          This  claim is without merit.  It is well accepted that\n\nthe  Seventh Amendment  affords  litigants in  federal courts  in\n\nPuerto  Rico the right to trial by jury, notwithstanding the fact\n\nthat the Constitution of Puerto Rico does not allow for juries in\n\ncivil cases.

However,  the\n\nverdict  form  correctly allowed  for  an  award of  compensatory\n\ndamages based on the  violation of either federal or  Puerto Rico\r                                                   \n\nlaw.   Because the jury's  finding that IBC  violated Puerto Rico\n\nlaw would  alone support the  award of compensatory  damages, the\n\nsubmission  of  the  claim based  on  the  Civil  Rights Act,  if\n\nincorrect,  was  harmless  error  and will  not  be  disturbed on\n\nappeal.
