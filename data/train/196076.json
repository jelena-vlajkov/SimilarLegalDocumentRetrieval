Ackerman,\r                                                                             \nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.   Plaintiff Robert Spickler  has filed a  42\r                           \n\nU.S.C.    1983 action against the State of Maine, complaining\n\nthat the state courts have deprived him of an impartial forum\n\nin violation  of his  First and Fourteenth  Amendment rights.\n\nAs  plaintiff's complaint  is irreparably  flawed  in various\n\nrespects, we affirm the amended judgment of dismissal.  \n\n     First, it is now settled that a state is not a  \"person\"\n\nsubject to  suit under   1983.  See, e.g., Hafer v. Melo, 502\r                                                                    \n\nU.S.  21,  25-26  (1991); Will  v.  Michigan  Dep't  of State\r                                                                         \n\nPolice, 491 U.S.  58, 62-70  (1989).  Second,  the action  is\r                  \n\nbarred by  the Eleventh  Amendment.  Contrary  to plaintiff's\n\nsuggestion, the enactment of   1983 did not serve to abrogate\n\nthe states' Eleventh Amendment immunity.  See, e.g., Quern v.\r                                                                      \n\nJordan,  440 U.S.  332,  342 (1979).    And contrary  to  his\r                  \n\nfurther contention, such immunity extends  to actions seeking\n\ninjunctive  relief against a state as well as to those simply\n\nseeking  damages.  See,  e.g., Puerto  Rico Aqueduct  &amp; Sewer\r                                                                         \n\nAuth. v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., 113 S. Ct. 684, 688-89 (1993);\r                                         \n\nPennhurst State School  &amp; Hosp.  v. Halderman,  465 U.S.  89,\r                                                         \n\n100-01 (1984); Cory v. White, 457 U.S. 85, 90-91 (1982).1\r                                        \n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Plaintiff  does  not  argue  that Maine  has  effected  a\ngeneral waiver of its Eleventh Amendment immunity in cases of\nthis  nature.  We thus need not address the issue, other than\nto  note that such a  contention has been elsewhere rejected.\nSee, e.g.,  Grenier v. Kennebec  County, Maine, 733  F. Supp.\r                                                          \n455 (D. Me. 1990).\r\r\n\n     Third, plaintiff fails to appreciate  that lower federal\n\ncourts  lack  jurisdiction  \"over  challenges  to state-court\n\ndecisions  in  particular  cases  arising  out  of   judicial\n\nproceedings even  if those  challenges allege that  the state\n\ncourt's action was unconstitutional.\"   District of  Columbia\r                                                                         \n\nCourt of  Appeals  v.  Feldman,  460 U.S.  462,  486  (1983);\r                                          \n\naccord,  e.g., Rooker  v. Fidelity  Trust Co.,  263  U.S. 413\r                                                         \n\n(1923).   Finally, most if  not all of  the instant complaint\n\nfalls  within  the  scope  of  the  1987  injunction  barring\n\nplaintiff from  filing further federal  court actions without\n\nleave of  court.  For the  reasons recited above, as  well as\n\nthose enumerated  by the  district court,  we agree  with the\n\ncourt's conclusion that plaintiff has not made a prima  facie\n\nshowing as required by that injunction. \n\n     Affirmed. \r                          \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
