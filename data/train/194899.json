IP\n\nintervenes  on the  side  of the  Board.   The  Board  cross-\n\npetitions for enforcement of that part of its order requiring\n\nIP  to offer a fifth  striker reinstatement.   In the Board's\n\ncross-petition,  the  Union intervenes  on  the  side of  the\n\nBoard.  For the reasons set forth below, we grant enforcement\n\nof the Board's order in its entirety. \n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                      FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n                                        \n\n          IP operates the Androscoggin Paper Mill in Jay,\n\nMaine.  Approximately 1200 members of the Union are among the\n\nemployees at the Jay facility.  In June 1987, the collective\n\nbargaining agreement between IP and the Union expired, and\n\nUnion workers went on strike.  Nevertheless, IP maintained\n\noperations at the mill throughout the strike, employing non-\n\nstriking union members and non-union replacement workers. \n\nThe walkout was marked by periodic outbreaks of violence,\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nthreats, and general strike-related misconduct.  In October,\n\n1988, after the strike ended, IP discharged eleven strikers. \n\n          The discharges prompted the Union to file an unfair\n\nlabor practice charge alleging that IP violated sections\n\n8(a)(3) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29\n\nU.S.C.   158(a)(3) and (1) (\"the Act\").  The Union maintained\n\nthat IP discriminated against striking employees by\n\ndismissing strikers for strike-related misconduct while\n\nfailing to dismiss non-strikers who had engaged in equally\n\nserious or more serious misconduct.  In a hearing before an\n\nAdministrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"), the Union's discrimination\n\nchallenge was limited to the discharge of the following five\n\nstrikers:  Lawrence Bilodeau, Lawrence Chicoine, Forrest\n\nFlagg, Thomas Hamlin, and Arthur Storer.  The ALJ compared\n\ntheir respective acts of misconduct with that of non-striker\n\nAndrew Barclay and found that all five strikers had engaged\n\nin strike-related misconduct which warranted their discharge,\n\nbut that IP's dismissal of strikers Bilodeau and Flagg\n\nconstituted unlawful disparate treatment.  The ALJ's finding\n\nwas predicated on his determination that non-striker Barclay,\n\nwho retained his job but received a warning, had engaged in\n\nstrike-related misconduct at least as serious as the\n\nmisconduct of Bilodeau and Flagg.  The ALJ found no disparate\n\ntreatment, however, in IP's discharge of Chicoine, Hamlin and\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nStorer.  Both IP and the Union filed exceptions to the ALJ's\n\ndecision.\n\n          On September 20, 1992, the Board issued a final\n\ndecision and order.  The Board affirmed the ALJ's finding\n\nthat IP had not engaged in disparate treatment in dismissing\n\nChicoine, Hamlin and Storer.  The Board also sustained the\n\nALJ's holding that IP had wrongfully discharged Bilodeau and\n\nordered his reinstatement.  However, the Board reversed the\n\nALJ's decision as to Flagg, finding his misconduct more\n\nserious than that committed by any of the non-strikers.  This\n\npetition for review and cross-petition for enforcement\n\nfollowed.    \n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                      Standard of Review\n                                        \n\n          This court must enforce the Board's order if its\n\nfindings are supported by substantial evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole and if it correctly applied the law. \n\nNLRB v.

We summarize them as follows:\n\n     Non-striker Andrew Barclay:  On July 30, 1987, Barclay\n     Non-striker Andrew Barclay\n     and his son, carrying baseball bats, confronted a group\n     of strikers who were attending a party near Barclay's\n     lakefront home.  Barclay complained to the strikers\n     about being harassed and constantly called a \"scab\", and\n     told them that he and his son were there to \"clean [the\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n     strikers] all out.\"1  The strikers asked Barclay to\n     leave, but he did not.  In an attempt to wrest the bat\n     from Barclay, striker Charles Fullerton received a cut\n     that required minor medical attention. \n\n     Striker Lawrence Bilodeau:  On October 28, 1987,\n     Striker Lawrence Bilodeau\n     Bilodeau, returning home from work, passed the home of a\n     replacement worker.  At the time, the worker was\n     standing in front of his house with his family. \n     Bilodeau then turned his truck around and stopped in\n     front of the worker's home.  Bilodeau noticed that the\n     worker was writing down his license plate number, and\n     yelled \"I've worked at the mill for twenty years, and\n     you ain't gonna be living here long you [expletive\n     deleted].  Go ahead and write down my license.  I live\n     right around the corner.\"\n\n     Striker Lawrence Chicoine:  On June 27, 1987, Chicoine\n     Striker Lawrence Chicoine\n     was picketing outside of the mill when he accosted one\n     non-striker and told her that he would kill her for\n     crossing the picket line.  On July 1, 1987, Chicoine was\n     again picketing outside of the mill when he used a\n     megaphone to threaten a number of replacement workers as\n     they arrived for work that \"he had a .44\" and \"would\n     blow [their] heads off.\"    \n\n     Striker Forrest Flagg:  On December 8, 1987, a\n     Striker Forrest Flagg\n     replacement worker drove by Flagg as Flagg picketed\n     outside of the mill.  Flagg opened the passenger door of\n     the replacement worker's car, reached into the car, and\n     shouted \"I'll kill you.\"\n\n     Striker Thomas Hamlin:  On August 7, 1987, after\n     Striker Thomas Hamlin\n     consuming a large quantity of beer and smoking numerous\n     marijuana cigarettes, Hamlin got into a truck and\n     followed two groups of replacement workers as they\n     returned home from work.  Hamlin harassed them and\n     attempted to run them off the road with his truck.\n\n     Striker Arthur Storer:  On August 6, 1987, as a\n     Striker Arthur Storer\n     replacement worker exited the mill, Storer threw a\n\n                    \n\n1.  Barclay later  told an  IP employee who  investigated the\nincident  that prior to this incident, a number of boats full\nof strikers had pulled up in front of his home, and had blown\nair  horns,  cursed,  and  threatened  him  and  his  family.\nBarclay  also claimed that the boats fired a projectile which\nbroke a window in his home, spraying glass over his son.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n     rock at her car, kicked the car, and then jumped on\n     the car's bumper.\n\n                             IV.\n                                \n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \nA.  Disparate Treatment  \n                     \n\n          The Union's principal contention is that IP engaged\n\nin unlawful disparate treatment by discharging the five strikers\n\nlisted above for engaging in strike-related misconduct which was\n\nless serious than misconduct committed by non-striker Barclay,\n\nwho was merely warned.2  The Board agreed with the Union as to\n\nBilodeau, but not as to the other four strikers.  We agree with\n\nthe Board's conclusions. \n\n          Pursuant to   7 of the Act, \"employees are granted\n\nthe right to peacefully strike, picket and engage in other\n\nconcerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining.\" \n\nNLRB v. Preterm, Inc., 784 F.2d 426, 429 (1st Cir. 1986). \n                   \n\nSection 7 also allows employees the right to refrain from these\n\nactivities if they so desire.  Id. \n                                \n\n          \"At the end of an economic strike, an employer,\n\nunless otherwise justified, must reinstate striking employees,\n\nlest their discharge penalize the employees for exercising their\n\n                    \n\n2.  To prove  disparate treatment, a  discharged striker need\nonly show that his/her misconduct was less  serious than that\nof one non-striker  who was  not discharged.   Here, the  ALJ\ndeemed  the conduct of Barclay to be  the most serious of the\nnon-strikers  who retained  their  jobs.    Having  carefully\nreviewed the record,  we agree with  the ALJ's conclusion  on\nthis question.  Accordingly, we use Barclay's conduct  as the\nbenchmark  against which  to  measure the  Union's  disparate\ntreatment claims.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nright to strike under   7 of the Act.\"  Associated Grocers of New\n                                                               \n\nEngland, Inc. v. NLRB, 562 F.2d 1333, 1335 (1st Cir. 1977).  It\n                   \n\nis well established that an employer is justified in discharging\n\na striking employee who engages in serious strike-related\n\nmisconduct.  Preterm, 784 F.2d at 429; Associated Grocers, 562\n                                                       \n\nF.2d at 1335.  Behavior that \"reasonably tend[s] to coerce or\n\nintimidate non-striking employees in the exercise of their right\n\nto refrain from strike activities\" constitutes serious strike-\n\nrelated misconduct and is cause for discharge as a matter of law. \n\nPreterm, 784 F.2d at 429 (quoting Clear Pine Mouldings, 268\n                                                    \n\nN.L.R.B. 1044, 1047 (1984), enforced mem., 765 F.2d 148 (9th Cir.\n                                       \n\n1985)).

Strikers Chicoine, Flagg, Hamlin and Storer\n                                             \n\n          The Board determined that, because the misconduct of\n\nstrikers Chicoine, Hamlin, Flagg and Storer was more serious than\n\nthe misconduct of non-striker Barclay, IP's decision to discharge\n\nthe four strikers did not constitute disparate treatment. \n\nEssentially, the Board found that Barclay's behavior was\n\nprovoked, and hence less serious than the strikers' misconduct,\n\nwhich, in each instance, was instigated by the striker. \n\n          We think that substantial evidence exists in the\n\nrecord to support the Board's finding that Barclay was provoked. \n\nBefore confronting the strikers, Barclay had been harassed at his\n\nhome by a group of strikers.  As we have observed, there was\n\nevidence suggesting that strikers had blown air horns from their\n\nboats in front of his house, shouted obscenities, threatened him,\n\nand fired a projectile through his window, showering his son with\n\n                    \n\n3.  IP  insists that  because  Barclay's  misconduct was  not\nsimilar to any of the acts committed by the five strikers, it\nis  not  appropriate  for  disparate  treatment  purposes  to\ncompare their behavior with his.  However, only the rarest of\ndisparate treatment cases would involve identical allegations\nof misconduct.   Adoption of IP's  position would, therefore,\neffectively  foreclose  disparate treatment  analysis  in the\nvast majority of these kinds of cases.  Because we  find such\na  requirement  to  be   unduly  stringent,  we  reject  IP's\nargument. \n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nglass.  It was only after these violent threats and acts that\n\nBarclay confronted a group of strikers with a baseball bat and\n\nangrily threatened them.  \n\n          In contrast, the record is devoid of evidence\n\nsuggesting that the actions of strikers Chicoine, Flagg, Hamlin\n\nand Storer had been provoked in any way.  Although we do not\n\ncondone Barclay's conduct, we think the Board's conclusion that\n\nhis provoked behavior was less egregious than the unprovoked\n\nactions of the four strikers was a reasonable one under the\n\ncircumstances.  Accordingly, we uphold the Board's decision\n\nrejecting the disparate treatment claims of Chicoine, Flagg,\n\nHamlin, and Storer.\n\n2.  Striker Bilodeau\n                  \n\n          The Board also adopted the ALJ's conclusion that the\n\nmisconduct of Barclay was more flagrant than that of Bilodeau,\n\nand that IP therefore acted unlawfully by discharging Bilodeau\n\nbut merely issuing a warning to Barclay.  The ALJ's conclusion\n\nwas based on his finding that (a) Barclay's threat was one of\n\nphysical injury and was therefore more serious than Bilodeau's\n\nthreat to property, and (b) Bilodeau's threat was \"less than\n\nexplicit.\"  \n\n          The major difference between the conduct of Bilodeau\n\nand Barclay, in our view, is that Barclay made his threat with a\n\nbaseball bat in hand, and thus possessed an immediate ability to\n\nact on the threat.  Bilodeau, on the other hand, made his threat\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nwhile standing in the road in front of the replacement worker's\n\nhouse, with no apparent ability or intent to immediately carry\n\nout his threat.  Record evidence, therefore, supports the ALJ's\n\nconclusion that Barclay's behavior was more egregious than that\n\nof Bilodeau.  See Associated Grocers, 562 F.2d at 1336\n                                  \n\n(explaining that courts should evaluate threats in light of all\n\nthe surrounding circumstances).  \n\nB.  Miscellaneous\n               \n\n          The Union raises two subsidiary arguments, each of\n\nwhich we find unpersuasive.  First, the Union argues that,\n\nbecause IP failed to obtain the strikers' first-hand accounts of\n\nthe incidents, it could not, as a matter of law, have fashioned\n\nan honest belief that the strikers committed the misconduct for\n\nwhich they were discharged.  As the record reveals, however, a\n\nnumber of eye-witnesses were present at each of the incidents. \n\nIn fact, two of the episodes were captured on videotape. \n\nFurther, evidence in the record supports a finding that IP relied\n\non these eye-witness accounts and the videotape.  Thus, although\n\nIP's understanding of the events would undoubtedly have been\n\nfortified by interviews with each striker, we cannot say that the\n\nfailure to conduct striker interviews, given this direct\n\nevidence, rendered their decision to discharge those strikers\n\nunlawful.  \n\n          The Union also argues that IP condoned the strikers'\n\nconduct when it sent each striker a form letter on February 1,\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nMarch 24, and September 23, 1988, outlining the reinstatement\n\nrights of striking employees.  Condonation exists only when clear\n\nand convincing evidence is present showing an employer's desire\n\n\"to forgive\" the guilty employee for the misconduct.  See Jones &amp;\n                                                               \n\nMcKnight, Inc. v. NLRB, 445 F.2d 97, 103 (7th Cir. 1971). See\n                                                           \n\nalso Woodlawn Hosp. v. NLRB, 596 F.2d 1330, 1341 (7th Cir. 1979)\n                         \n\n(holding that condonation exists only \"where the employer has\n\nclearly indicated forgiveness\").  We agree with the ALJ's\n\nconclusion, adopted by the Board, that a form letter sent to\n\napproximately 1250 workers, informing the striking employees of\n\ntheir statutory right to reinstatement under certain\n\ncircumstances, falls well short of clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat IP condoned the misconduct of the five strikers.4 \n\nAccordingly, the Union's condonation argument is unavailing.5\n\n                              V.\n                                \n\n                          Conclusion\n                                    \n\n          Because we find that the Board correctly applied the\n\nlaw and that substantial evidence in the record supports all of\n\nthe Board's findings, we grant enforcement of the Board's order\n\nin its entirety.\n\n                    \n\n4.  Because we  agree with  the Board's conclusion  that IP's\ndecision to  discharge strikers  Chicoine, Flagg,  Hamlin and\nStorer  was  not  discriminatory,  we  need  not  reach  IP's\nalternative  argument that  the  Union's claims  as to  those\nstrikers are time-barred  under section 10(b) of  the Act, 29\nU.S.C.   160(b).\n\n5.  We  have reviewed the  remainder of IP's  and the Union's\narguments and find them to be without merit.\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\n          Affirmed.

IP\n\nintervenes  on the  side  of the  Board.   The  Board  cross-\n\npetitions for enforcement of that part of its order requiring\n\nIP  to offer a fifth  striker reinstatement.   In the Board's\n\ncross-petition,  the  Union intervenes  on  the  side of  the\n\nBoard.  For the reasons set forth below, we grant enforcement\n\nof the Board's order in its entirety. \n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                      FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n                                        \n\n          IP operates the Androscoggin Paper Mill in Jay,\n\nMaine.  Approximately 1200 members of the Union are among the\n\nemployees at the Jay facility.  In June 1987, the collective\n\nbargaining agreement between IP and the Union expired, and\n\nUnion workers went on strike.  Nevertheless, IP maintained\n\noperations at the mill throughout the strike, employing non-\n\nstriking union members and non-union replacement workers. \n\nThe walkout was marked by periodic outbreaks of violence,\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nthreats, and general strike-related misconduct.  In October,\n\n1988, after the strike ended, IP discharged eleven strikers. \n\n          The discharges prompted the Union to file an unfair\n\nlabor practice charge alleging that IP violated sections\n\n8(a)(3) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29\n\nU.S.C.   158(a)(3) and (1) (\"the Act\").  The Union maintained\n\nthat IP discriminated against striking employees by\n\ndismissing strikers for strike-related misconduct while\n\nfailing to dismiss non-strikers who had engaged in equally\n\nserious or more serious misconduct.  In a hearing before an\n\nAdministrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"), the Union's discrimination\n\nchallenge was limited to the discharge of the following five\n\nstrikers:  Lawrence Bilodeau, Lawrence Chicoine, Forrest\n\nFlagg, Thomas Hamlin, and Arthur Storer.  The ALJ compared\n\ntheir respective acts of misconduct with that of non-striker\n\nAndrew Barclay and found that all five strikers had engaged\n\nin strike-related misconduct which warranted their discharge,\n\nbut that IP's dismissal of strikers Bilodeau and Flagg\n\nconstituted unlawful disparate treatment.  The ALJ's finding\n\nwas predicated on his determination that non-striker Barclay,\n\nwho retained his job but received a warning, had engaged in\n\nstrike-related misconduct at least as serious as the\n\nmisconduct of Bilodeau and Flagg.  The ALJ found no disparate\n\ntreatment, however, in IP's discharge of Chicoine, Hamlin and\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nStorer.  Both IP and the Union filed exceptions to the ALJ's\n\ndecision.\n\n          On September 20, 1992, the Board issued a final\n\ndecision and order.  The Board affirmed the ALJ's finding\n\nthat IP had not engaged in disparate treatment in dismissing\n\nChicoine, Hamlin and Storer.  The Board also sustained the\n\nALJ's holding that IP had wrongfully discharged Bilodeau and\n\nordered his reinstatement.  However, the Board reversed the\n\nALJ's decision as to Flagg, finding his misconduct more\n\nserious than that committed by any of the non-strikers.  This\n\npetition for review and cross-petition for enforcement\n\nfollowed.    \n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                      Standard of Review\n                                        \n\n          This court must enforce the Board's order if its\n\nfindings are supported by substantial evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole and if it correctly applied the law. \n\nNLRB v.

Barclay complained to the strikers\n     about being harassed and constantly called a \"scab\", and\n     told them that he and his son were there to \"clean [the\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n     strikers] all out.\"1  The strikers asked Barclay to\n     leave, but he did not.  In an attempt to wrest the bat\n     from Barclay, striker Charles Fullerton received a cut\n     that required minor medical attention. \n\n     Striker Lawrence Bilodeau:  On October 28, 1987,\n     Striker Lawrence Bilodeau\n     Bilodeau, returning home from work, passed the home of a\n     replacement worker.  At the time, the worker was\n     standing in front of his house with his family. \n     Bilodeau then turned his truck around and stopped in\n     front of the worker's home.  Bilodeau noticed that the\n     worker was writing down his license plate number, and\n     yelled \"I've worked at the mill for twenty years, and\n     you ain't gonna be living here long you [expletive\n     deleted].  Go ahead and write down my license.  I live\n     right around the corner.\"\n\n     Striker Lawrence Chicoine:  On June 27, 1987, Chicoine\n     Striker Lawrence Chicoine\n     was picketing outside of the mill when he accosted one\n     non-striker and told her that he would kill her for\n     crossing the picket line.  On July 1, 1987, Chicoine was\n     again picketing outside of the mill when he used a\n     megaphone to threaten a number of replacement workers as\n     they arrived for work that \"he had a .44\" and \"would\n     blow [their] heads off.\"    \n\n     Striker Forrest Flagg:  On December 8, 1987, a\n     Striker Forrest Flagg\n     replacement worker drove by Flagg as Flagg picketed\n     outside of the mill.  Flagg opened the passenger door of\n     the replacement worker's car, reached into the car, and\n     shouted \"I'll kill you.\"\n\n     Striker Thomas Hamlin:  On August 7, 1987, after\n     Striker Thomas Hamlin\n     consuming a large quantity of beer and smoking numerous\n     marijuana cigarettes, Hamlin got into a truck and\n     followed two groups of replacement workers as they\n     returned home from work.  Hamlin harassed them and\n     attempted to run them off the road with his truck.\n\n     Striker Arthur Storer:  On August 6, 1987, as a\n     Striker Arthur Storer\n     replacement worker exited the mill, Storer threw a\n\n                    \n\n1.  Barclay later  told an  IP employee who  investigated the\nincident  that prior to this incident, a number of boats full\nof strikers had pulled up in front of his home, and had blown\nair  horns,  cursed,  and  threatened  him  and  his  family.\nBarclay  also claimed that the boats fired a projectile which\nbroke a window in his home, spraying glass over his son.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n     rock at her car, kicked the car, and then jumped on\n     the car's bumper.\n\n                             IV.\n                                \n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \nA.  Disparate Treatment  \n                     \n\n          The Union's principal contention is that IP engaged\n\nin unlawful disparate treatment by discharging the five strikers\n\nlisted above for engaging in strike-related misconduct which was\n\nless serious than misconduct committed by non-striker Barclay,\n\nwho was merely warned.2  The Board agreed with the Union as to\n\nBilodeau, but not as to the other four strikers.  We agree with\n\nthe Board's conclusions. \n\n          Pursuant to   7 of the Act, \"employees are granted\n\nthe right to peacefully strike, picket and engage in other\n\nconcerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining.\" \n\nNLRB v.

Strikers Chicoine, Flagg, Hamlin and Storer\n                                             \n\n          The Board determined that, because the misconduct of\n\nstrikers Chicoine, Hamlin, Flagg and Storer was more serious than\n\nthe misconduct of non-striker Barclay, IP's decision to discharge\n\nthe four strikers did not constitute disparate treatment. \n\nEssentially, the Board found that Barclay's behavior was\n\nprovoked, and hence less serious than the strikers' misconduct,\n\nwhich, in each instance, was instigated by the striker. \n\n          We think that substantial evidence exists in the\n\nrecord to support the Board's finding that Barclay was provoked. \n\nBefore confronting the strikers, Barclay had been harassed at his\n\nhome by a group of strikers.  As we have observed, there was\n\nevidence suggesting that strikers had blown air horns from their\n\nboats in front of his house, shouted obscenities, threatened him,\n\nand fired a projectile through his window, showering his son with\n\n                    \n\n3.  IP  insists that  because  Barclay's  misconduct was  not\nsimilar to any of the acts committed by the five strikers, it\nis  not  appropriate  for  disparate  treatment  purposes  to\ncompare their behavior with his.  However, only the rarest of\ndisparate treatment cases would involve identical allegations\nof misconduct.   Adoption of IP's  position would, therefore,\neffectively  foreclose  disparate treatment  analysis  in the\nvast majority of these kinds of cases.  Because we  find such\na  requirement  to  be   unduly  stringent,  we  reject  IP's\nargument. \n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nglass.  It was only after these violent threats and acts that\n\nBarclay confronted a group of strikers with a baseball bat and\n\nangrily threatened them.  \n\n          In contrast, the record is devoid of evidence\n\nsuggesting that the actions of strikers Chicoine, Flagg, Hamlin\n\nand Storer had been provoked in any way.  Although we do not\n\ncondone Barclay's conduct, we think the Board's conclusion that\n\nhis provoked behavior was less egregious than the unprovoked\n\nactions of the four strikers was a reasonable one under the\n\ncircumstances.  Accordingly, we uphold the Board's decision\n\nrejecting the disparate treatment claims of Chicoine, Flagg,\n\nHamlin, and Storer.\n\n2.  Striker Bilodeau\n                  \n\n          The Board also adopted the ALJ's conclusion that the\n\nmisconduct of Barclay was more flagrant than that of Bilodeau,\n\nand that IP therefore acted unlawfully by discharging Bilodeau\n\nbut merely issuing a warning to Barclay.  The ALJ's conclusion\n\nwas based on his finding that (a) Barclay's threat was one of\n\nphysical injury and was therefore more serious than Bilodeau's\n\nthreat to property, and (b) Bilodeau's threat was \"less than\n\nexplicit.\"  \n\n          The major difference between the conduct of Bilodeau\n\nand Barclay, in our view, is that Barclay made his threat with a\n\nbaseball bat in hand, and thus possessed an immediate ability to\n\nact on the threat.  Bilodeau, on the other hand, made his threat\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nwhile standing in the road in front of the replacement worker's\n\nhouse, with no apparent ability or intent to immediately carry\n\nout his threat.  Record evidence, therefore, supports the ALJ's\n\nconclusion that Barclay's behavior was more egregious than that\n\nof Bilodeau.

Miscellaneous\n               \n\n          The Union raises two subsidiary arguments, each of\n\nwhich we find unpersuasive.  First, the Union argues that,\n\nbecause IP failed to obtain the strikers' first-hand accounts of\n\nthe incidents, it could not, as a matter of law, have fashioned\n\nan honest belief that the strikers committed the misconduct for\n\nwhich they were discharged.  As the record reveals, however, a\n\nnumber of eye-witnesses were present at each of the incidents. \n\nIn fact, two of the episodes were captured on videotape. \n\nFurther, evidence in the record supports a finding that IP relied\n\non these eye-witness accounts and the videotape.  Thus, although\n\nIP's understanding of the events would undoubtedly have been\n\nfortified by interviews with each striker, we cannot say that the\n\nfailure to conduct striker interviews, given this direct\n\nevidence, rendered their decision to discharge those strikers\n\nunlawful.  \n\n          The Union also argues that IP condoned the strikers'\n\nconduct when it sent each striker a form letter on February 1,\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nMarch 24, and September 23, 1988, outlining the reinstatement\n\nrights of striking employees.  Condonation exists only when clear\n\nand convincing evidence is present showing an employer's desire\n\n\"to forgive\" the guilty employee for the misconduct.

We agree with the ALJ's\n\nconclusion, adopted by the Board, that a form letter sent to\n\napproximately 1250 workers, informing the striking employees of\n\ntheir statutory right to reinstatement under certain\n\ncircumstances, falls well short of clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat IP condoned the misconduct of the five strikers.4 \n\nAccordingly, the Union's condonation argument is unavailing.5\n\n                              V.\n                                \n\n                          Conclusion\n                                    \n\n          Because we find that the Board correctly applied the\n\nlaw and that substantial evidence in the record supports all of\n\nthe Board's findings, we grant enforcement of the Board's order\n\nin its entirety.\n\n                    \n\n4.
