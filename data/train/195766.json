Grella, trustee in\n\nbankruptcy  (\"Trustee\") for  debtor The Beverly  Corporation (the\n\n\"Debtor\"),  appeals   the  district  court's  affirmance  of  the\n\nbankruptcy court's  grant of summary judgment  against Trustee in\n\nfavor of  creditor Salem  Five Cents  Savings Bank  (the \"Bank\").\n\nBecause  we  find that  the  bankruptcy court  erred  in entering\n\nsummary  judgment   against  the  Trustee  and   barring  him  on\n\nprinciples of res judicata  and collateral estoppel from pursuing\r                                    \n\na  counterclaim against the Bank,  we reverse, and  remand to the\n\nbankruptcy  court for  further proceedings  consistent  with this\n\nopinion.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          On  January 26,  1988, the  Debtor signed  a $1,000,000\n\npromissory  note  in  favor  of  the  Bank.    The  Debtor  later\n\ncollaterally assigned various promissory notes and mortgages (the\n\n\"Seventeen Notes\") to  the Bank to  secure that debt.   Among the\n\nSeventeen  Notes was a $290,000 note  from the Wellesley Mortgage\n\nCorporation (the \"Wellesley Note\").  \n\n          On  September 4,  1992,  the Debtor  filed a  voluntary\n\npetition under Chapter 7  of the Bankruptcy Code, activating  the\n                    \r                              \n\n1   Unless otherwise noted,  all citations of  statutory sections\nare  to the Bankruptcy  Reform Act of  1978, 11 U.S.C.     101 et\r                                                                           \nseq., as amended.\r             \n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nautomatic stay provisions of    362.   On December 18, 1992,  the\n\nBank filed a Motion  for Relief from the Automatic  Stay pursuant\n\nto   362(d)(1),  seeking an order  allowing the Bank  to exercise\n\nits contractual  and state  law rights  and remedies against  the\n\nDebtor with respect  to the Seventeen Notes.2  In  its Motion for\n\nRelief, the  Bank claimed to have a \"perfected security interest\"\n\nin  the Seventeen  Notes because  it was  \"in sole  and exclusive\n\npossession\" of the  originals.  The Bank did not  state or allege\n\nany  other details  regarding its  security interest.   The  Bank\n\nasserted, as a  basis for relief, that  the Debtor was  unable to\n\nprovide  the Bank  with  adequate protection  for its  collateral\n\nposition.\n\n          In his Response  to the Bank's  Motion for Relief  from\n\nStay, the Trustee did  not contest the Bank's Motion,  but merely\n\nstated  that he  had  not  had  sufficient  time  to  review  the\n\npertinent  files  and determine  the  existence  of any  possible\n\ndefenses to the Bank's claims.  The Trustee then requested that a\n\npreliminary hearing on the  Motion be scheduled, after sufficient\n\ntime to review the files.\n\n          After a  hearing on the  Bank's Motion for  Relief from\n\n                    \r                              \n\n2  Section 362(d)(1) provides in pertinent part:\n\n            On  request  of a  party in  interest and\n            after notice  and  a hearing,  the  court\n            shall grant  relief from  the stay .  . .\n            for cause, including the lack of adequate\n            protection of an interest in  property of\n            such party in interest. . . .\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nStay  on  January 14,  1993,3  the Bankruptcy  Court  granted the\n\nMotion  and issued an order lifting the  automatic stay as to the\n\nBank, and  allowing  the Bank  to exercise  \"any and  all of  its\n\ncontractual and state  law rights and  remedies\" with respect  to\n\nthe Seventeen  Notes.  In neither  the hearing nor the  order did\n\nthe  bankruptcy court make any  findings about the  status of the\n\nBank's security interest in the Seventeen Notes.\n\n          Having  obtained relief  from  stay, the  Bank filed  a\n\nComplaint on February 19, 1993, requesting a determination of its\n\nsecured  status under   506(a),4 and a turnover and accounting of\n\nfunds by  the Trustee as to  the Seventeen Notes.   In support of\n\nits Complaint, the  Bank alleged  only that it  had a  \"perfected\n\nsecurity  interest\"  in the  Notes because  it  was \"in  sole and\n\nexclusive  possession\" of them.  Again, the Bank offered no other\n\ndetails or arguments regarding its interest in the Notes. \n\n          On  March 29,  1993,  the Trustee  answered the  Bank's\n\nComplaint (the  \"Answer\"), denying the Bank's  allegation that it\n\nhad a perfected security interest  in the Seventeen Notes because\n\nof  its  exclusive  possession.    The  Trustee  asserted  as  an\n\naffirmative defense  that the Bank  did not perfect  its security\n\n                    \r                              \n\n3  The Trustee did not attend this hearing, for  reasons that are\nunexplained in the record.  Both the Bank and  the district court\nmake much of his absence.  While we agree with the district court\nthat  a  trustee's  failure  to  attend  a  scheduled  hearing is\ntroubling and not to  be encouraged, we do  not find his  absence\nrelevant to our analysis here.\n\n4  Section  506 allows a  creditor to seek  determination of  the\nstatus of  a lien on property in which the debtor's estate has an\ninterest.\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ninterest in the Wellesley Note prior to 90 days before the Debtor\n\nfiled  its  bankruptcy petition.    The  Answer also  included  a\n\nCounterclaim, alleging that the  Bank's interest in the Wellesley\n\nNote is avoidable as a preferential transfer.5  \n\n          On  April  8, 1993,  the  Bank  answered the  Trustee's\n\ncounterclaim (the  \"Reply\").  The  Bank asserted, inter  alia, on\r                                                                       \n\nthe grounds of estoppel, waiver and collateral estoppel, that the\n\nTrustee  was barred  from  pursuing  his preference  counterclaim\n\nbecause he  failed to file or pursue  any objection to the Bank's\n\nMotion for Relief from Stay.\n\n          On July 7, 1993, the Trustee moved for summary judgment\n\non  his preference  counterclaim.   On August  3, 1993,  the Bank\n\nopposed  that motion and cross-moved  for summary judgment on the\n\nground that either res judicata or collateral estoppel barred the\r                                         \n\ncounterclaim,  as  the  issue of  the  \"validity\"  of  the Bank's\n\ninterest  in  the Notes  was  decided when  the  Bankruptcy Court\n\ngranted the relief from  stay.  The Bankruptcy Court  denied both\n\nsummary judgment motions, finding genuine issues of material fact\n\nto exist regarding \"the status of the holder of the note.\"   With\n\nrespect  to  the  Bank's  res judicata  and  collateral  estoppel\r                                                \n                    \r                              \n\n5   A \"preference\"  is a transfer  of a debtor's  assets during a\nspecified  pre-bankruptcy  period that  unjustifiably  favors the\ntransferee  over other creditors.  In re Melon Produce, Inc., 976\r                                                                      \nF.2d  71, 73 (1st  Cir. 1992).   Section 547 allows  a bankruptcy\ntrustee,   in  certain   circumstances,  to   avoid  preferential\ntransfers  of an interest of the debtor  if the transfer was made\nwithin 90  days before the date  of the filing of  the bankruptcy\npetition.    The creation  of  a perfected  security  interest in\nproperty  during  this  90-day  preference  period  is  itself  a\npreferential transfer  if it  meets the other  requirements of   \n547.  In re Melon Produce, Inc., 976 F.2d at 74.\r                                         \n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\narguments, the Bankruptcy Court did not make a ruling, but merely\n\nsaid that it was a \"legal issue which we can get into later.\"  \n\n          On November  16, 1993, the  Trustee filed a  motion for\n\nsummary  judgment on  the  res judicata  and collateral  estoppel\r                                                 \n\nissues,  arguing  that the  doctrines  were  inapplicable to  the\n\nTrustee's   preference  counterclaim,   as  there  had   been  no\n\nadjudication on the merits of the Bank's security interest during\n\nthe  relief from  stay  proceeding.   On the  first  page of  his\n\nMemorandum  of Law in support of the Motion for summary judgment,\n\nthe Trustee stated:\n\n            Only the note  entitled \"Wellesley  Mort.\n            Corp. of April  25, 1990\" (the  Wellesley\n            Note) . . . is presently in dispute.  The\n            other notes and mortgages . . . have been\n            determined   [by   the  Trustee]   to  be\n            perfected security interests in  favor of\n            [the Bank].\n\n          Three days  later, the Trustee filed a Motion for Leave\n\nto Amend his Memorandum  of Law, seeking to amend  this statement\n\nof facts.  The Trustee explained that the original memorandum was\n\nwritten  some months before, and at that time the Trustee thought\n\nthat there was  no dispute as to sixteen of  the Seventeen Notes.\n\nSometime after the original memorandum was written, but before it\n\nwas  filed, the Trustee apparently determined  that he did indeed\n\ndispute the Bank's interest  in the other notes as well,  but had\n\nneglected to edit his memorandum before filing it with the court.\n\nThe Bank objected to the Trustee's Motion for summary judgment on\n\nthe res judicata and  collateral estoppel issues, and cross-moved\r                          \n\nfor summary judgment.  \n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          After a  hearing on  the motions, the  bankruptcy court\n\ngranted  summary  judgment  in  favor  of  the  Bank.6    In  its\n\ndecision,  the  court  stated  without explanation  that  it  was\n\ntreating the Trustee's preference counterclaim as an \"affirmative\n\ndefense.\"   Although  the court  recognized that  the hearing  on\n\nrelief from  stay was a  preliminary one,  the court  went on  to\n\nstate:\n\n            The   question   of   the  validity   and\n            perfection of a  security interest  which\n            is the  subject of  a request  for relief\n            from stay goes to the heart of the issues\n            before  the court  [during a  relief from\n            stay hearing].   If the security interest\n            were invalid or unperfected,  there would\n            be no cause for  relief from stay and the\n            request  would  be denied  .  .  . .  The\n            Trustee could have raised  the perfection\n            issue    [underlying    his    preference\n            counterclaim]  at  the  hearing   on  the\n            motion for relief.  If he felt that I was\n            wrong in denying  him additional time  to\n            respond,  an  appeal  from my  order  was\n            appropriate.    Having had  the potential\n            for  one bite  at  the  apple, he  cannot\n            relitigate the issue at this time.\n\nThe  court reasoned  that the  perfection issue  was necessarily,\n\nimplicitly decided in the relief from stay  proceedings, and thus\n\ngranted  summary judgment in the  Bank's favor \"as  to the entire\n\nadversary  proceeding\"  on collateral  estoppel  or  res judicata\r                                                                           \n\ngrounds.\n\n          On May 23, 1994, the district court issued a Memorandum\n\nand  Order  affirming  the  bankruptcy  court's  decision.    The\n                    \r                              \n\n6   Although the  court did not explicitly  rule on the Trustee's\nMotion for Leave  to Amend  his original memorandum  of law,  the\ncourt stated in  its Decision  that the parties  agreed that  the\nonly note in dispute was the Wellesley Note.\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\ndistrict court ruled that  collateral estoppel bars the Trustee's\n\npreference counterclaim, and entered judgment in the Bank's favor\n\non May 25, 1994.    \n\n                         II.

We  have\r                                                   \n\nexplained that there are two different aspects of res judicata --\r                                                                        \n\nclaim  preclusion  and  collateral  estoppel (also  called  issue\n\npreclusion).

The essential elements of claim preclusion\n\nare: (1) a final judgment on the merits in an earlier action; (2)\n\nan identity  of parties or privies  in the two suits;  and (3) an\n\nidentity of  the cause of action  in both suits.   Aunyx Corp. v.\r                                                                        \n\nCanon U.S.A., Inc., 978 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir. 1992), cert.  denied,\r                                                                          \n\n   U.S.    , 113  S.

When there is an identity of the parties\n\nin  subsequent actions,  a  party must  establish four  essential\n\nelements for a successful application of issue preclusion to  the\n\nlater action:  (1) the  issue sought to be precluded must  be the\n\nsame  as that involved  in the prior  action; (2) the  issue must\n\nhave been  actually  litigated;  (3) the  issue  must  have  been\n\ndetermined by a  valid and  binding final judgment;  and (4)  the\n\ndetermination  of  the  issue must  have  been  essential  to the\n\njudgment.  See NLRB  v. Donna-Lee Sportswear Co., Inc.,  836 F.2d\r                                                                \n\n31, 34  (1st Cir. 1987); In re Sestito, 136 B.R. 602, 604 (Bankr.\r                                                \n\nD.

An  issue may be  \"actually\" decided  even if  it is not\n\nexplicitly  decided, for  it may  have constituted,  logically or\r                    \n\npractically, a necessary component of the decision reached in the\n\nprior  litigation.     Dennis,  744  F.2d  at  899  (emphasis  in\r                                       \n\noriginal).\n\n          As the  Trustee points out,  it is unclear  whether the\n\nbankruptcy court relied on claim or  issue preclusion in entering\n\nsummary   judgment   and   barring   the   Trustee's   preference\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\ncounterclaim.   Although  the  court's decision  refers to  claim\n\npreclusion, it is  based on  an issue preclusion  analysis.   The\n\ndistrict court  likewise expressly  based its reasoning  on issue\n\npreclusion principles.   Both  the Bank  and the Trustee  contend\n\nthat  the doctrine of  issue preclusion is  the appropriate basis\n\nfor  our analysis  here,  and we  agree.   Thus, the  broad issue\n\nbefore us is whether all of the elements of issue preclusion, set\n\nforth  above,  are met.   In  order  to make  this determination,\n\nhowever,  we  must  first   consider  exactly  what  issues  were\n\nadjudicated  during the initial action, a hearing on a motion for\n\nrelief from stay.\n\n          C.   Issues Determined During a   362(d) Hearing\r                    C.   Issues Determined During a   362(d) Hearing\r                                                                    \n\n          The  Trustee argues that the  allowance of a motion for\n\nrelief from stay  does not  preclude the later  prosecution of  a\n\npreference action, as a  determination of the non-avoidability of\n\na lien  under   547 is  not, logically or practically,  part of a\n\ncourt's  decision to grant relief from  stay.  In support of this\n\nposition,  the Trustee  cites the  Seventh Circuit's  decision of\n\nMatter  of Vitreous  Steel Prods.  Co., 911  F.2d 1223  (7th Cir.\r                                                \n\n1990), and urges us to adopt that court's reasoning.\n\n          In  Vitreous  Steel,  the  appeals court  held  that  a\r                                       \n\ndecision to lift the automatic stay pursuant to   362(d) does not\n\npreclude the prosecution under    547 of an adversary  complaint.\n\nVitreous Steel, 911 F.2d  at 1234.  The  court reasoned that  the\r                        \n\npossible avoidability of a transfer to a creditor  under   547 is\n\nnot  an issue proper for adjudication by a court during a hearing\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\non a motion  to lift  the automatic stay,  and accordingly  found\n\nthat  the   bankruptcy  court   erred  in  barring   a  trustee's\n\npreferential transfer claim on  collateral estoppel grounds.  Id.\r                                                                          \n\n          The Vitreous Steel holding rests on persuasive grounds.\r                                      \n\nFirst,  as the Seventh Circuit  noted, it is  consistent with the\n\nstatutory scheme established by   362,  and particularly with the\n\npurpose of  the relief from stay  provision of   362(d).   Id. at\r                                                                       \n\n1232.   As  soon  as  a  petition in  bankruptcy  is  filed,  the\n\nautomatic stay provisions  of   362  take effect, preventing  all\n\npre-petition creditors from taking action to collect their debts.\n\nIn certain situations,  such as  when a creditor  has a  security\n\ninterest in the debtor's property and the value of the collateral\n\nis less than the  amount of the debt, bankruptcy  proceedings may\n\nonly delay the inevitable result.  There may be no reason to make\n\nthe creditor wait for the distribution of the estate, and indeed,\n\nearly release  of  the property  may  aid administration  of  the\n\nestate  by allowing a quicker  determination of the  amount of an\n\nundersecured creditor's  claim.  Id. at 1231-32.   Thus, Congress\r                                             \n\nincluded  the provision  for  relief from  stay  under    362(d),\n\nallowing  bankruptcy  courts  to  lift  the  stay  as to  certain\n\ncreditors if grounds for relief are presented.   Id. at 1232; see\r                                                                           \n\n11 U.S.C.   362(d).  These grounds are the adequacy of protection\n\nfor  the creditor, the debtor's  equity in the  property, and the\n\nnecessity of the  property to  an effective  reorganization.   11\n\nU.S.C.   362(d).  That the statute sets forth certain grounds for\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nrelief and  no others indicates Congress' intent  that the issues\n\ndecided by a bankruptcy  court on a creditor's motion to lift the\n\nstay be limited to these matters.  See 11 U.S.C.   362(d).\r                                                \n\n          Moreover, the hearing  on a motion for relief from stay\n\nis meant to be a summary proceeding, and the statute requires the\n\nbankruptcy  court's action to be quick.  Vitreous Steel, 911 F.2d\r                                                                 \n\nat 1232; see 11 U.S.C.   362(e).  Section    362(e) provides that\r                      \n\na bankruptcy court must hold a preliminary hearing on a motion to\n\nlift  the stay  within thirty days  from the  date the  motion is\n\nfiled, or the  stay will be considered  lifted.  A  final hearing\n\nmust  be  commenced  within  thirty days  after  the  preliminary\n\nhearing.  Vitreous Steel, 911 F.2d at 1232 (citing Fed. R.

Trustees would\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nbe forced to assert (and win) not only objections to motions  for\n\nrelief  from  stay,  but  any   and  all  possible  defenses  and\n\ncounterclaims to the underlying claims of the movant creditor, or\n\nrisk being precluded  from raising them later.  Bankruptcy courts\n\nwould likewise be forced to determine the  validity, priority and\n\nextent of  a lien during  the relief from  stay hearing,  and the\n\ncreditor's motion would thus become a \"substitute\" for the normal\n\nadversary   proceedings  on  the  merits.    See  In  re  Quality\r                                                                           \n\nElectronics, 57 B.R. at 290.\r                     \n\n          Moreover,  the  Bankruptcy  Code specifically  provides\n\nthat a trustee has two years after appointment or until the close\n\nof  the case  to commence  a    547  preference action.   Section\n\n546(a)(1).  A relief from stay proceeding, conversely, is usually\n\ncommenced very  shortly after  the bankruptcy petition  is filed,\n\nand, as explained  above, must  be completed no  more than  sixty\n\ndays from the filing of the  motion for relief.  Forcing trustees\n\nto raise  their counterclaims  within that short  period, usually\n\nduring the nascent stages  of a bankruptcy case, would  in effect\n\nallow  movant  creditors  to  drastically  reduce  the   two-year\n\nlimitations period  set forth  in  the Code.   Not  only is  this\n\nresult patently unfair and inefficient, it renders the Bankruptcy\n\nCode's statutes  of limitations provision irrelevant  -- a result\n\nwe cannot endorse.\n\n          For  all these  reasons, we  find that  a hearing  on a\n\nmotion for relief  from stay  is merely a  summary proceeding  of\n\nlimited effect, and adopt the Vitreous Steel court's holding that\r                                                      \n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\na court hearing a motion for relief from stay should seek only to\n\ndetermine whether the party seeking  relief has a colorable claim\n\nto property of the estate.  The statutory and procedural schemes,\n\nthe legislative history,  and the  case law all  direct that  the\n\nhearing on  a motion to  lift the  stay is not  a proceeding  for\n\ndetermining  the  merits of  the  underlying substantive  claims,\n\ndefenses,  or  counterclaims.    Rather,  it is  analogous  to  a\n\npreliminary   injunction   hearing,   requiring   a   speedy  and\n\nnecessarily  cursory determination  of the  reasonable likelihood\n\nthat  a creditor has a legitimate claim  or lien as to a debtor's\n\nproperty.8  If  a court finds that  likelihood to exist, this  is\n\nnot a determination of the validity of those claims, but merely a\n\ngrant  of permission  from the  court allowing  that  creditor to\n\nlitigate its substantive claims  elsewhere without violating  the\n\nautomatic stay.\n\n          This is not  to say  that bankruptcy  courts can  never\n\n                    \r                              \n\n8   Indeed, the legislative history  of   362  suggests this very\nanalogy:\n\n            [T]he  automatic  stay  is similar  to  a\n            temporary   restraining   order.      The\n            preliminary  hearing  [on  a  motion  for\n            relief  from  stay]  is  similar  to  the\n            hearing  on   a  preliminary  injunction,\n            . . . . The main difference lies in which\n            party  must bring  the  issue before  the\n            court.  While in the  injunction setting,\n            the  party  seeking  the injunction  must\n            prosecute the action, in  proceedings for\n            relief  from  the  automatic   stay,  the\n            enjoined party must move.  \n\nH.R.

As several\n\nbankruptcy  courts  have   discussed,  there  is  a   significant\n\ndifference  between  mere  consideration  of  claims   and  final\n\nadjudication on the merits.  See In re Pappas, 55 B.R. at 660; In\r                                                                           \n\nre Gellert,  55 B.R. at 974-75; In re Tally Well, 45 B.R. at 152.\r                                                          \n\nCertainly,  a court may take  into account any  matter that bears\n\ndirectly  on  the debtor's  equity,  or  that  clearly refutes  a\n\ncreditor's  claim to  the property.   For  example, if  a trustee\n\nraises a defense  to a creditor's claim  at the relief  from stay\n\nhearing, the court need not ignore this defense, but may consider\n\nit when deciding whether to lift the stay.  If, however, the stay\n\nis not lifted, that  creditor is not barred forever  from seeking\n\npayment.  It must simply comply with the automatic stay, and wait\n\nwith the other creditors for the estate's administration. \n\n          Conversely,  if the  stay is  lifted, the  creditor may\n\nthen prosecute its  claim in subsequent litigation.   The trustee\n\nis not precluded from raising  defenses or counterclaims in those\n\nsubsequent  proceedings,  because  the  defense  was  not   fully\n\nadjudicated, but only considered, during the preliminary hearing.\n\nAs  a  matter of  law, the  only  issue properly  and necessarily\n\nbefore a bankruptcy  court during relief from stay proceedings is\n\nwhether  the  movant  creditor  has a  colorable  claim;  thus, a\n\ndecision to lift the  stay is not an adjudication of the validity\n\nor avoidability of the  claim, but only a determination  that the\n\ncreditor's  claim   is  sufficiently  plausible   to  allow   its\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nprosecution elsewhere.\n\n          The Bank  nevertheless submits that the  Vitreous Steel\r                                                                           \n\nanalysis is \"flawed,\" and argues:\n\n            [A] determination (though not necessarily\n            a final one) as  to a creditor's security\n            interest  is  an  integral  part  of  any\r                                  \n            decision  regarding  the  lifting of  the\n            stay .  . .  if  the creditor's  security\n            interest  can be avoided  for any reason,\n            there is no cause  to grant the  creditor\n            relief  from  stay  because the  creditor\n            lacks   an   interest  in   the  debtor's\n            property.  \n\n(Emphasis  in original).    Essentially, the  Bank contends  that\n\nbecause  establishing  the  validity  of  a  creditor's  security\n\ninterest is an essential element of a relief from  stay, the fact\n\nthat  the stay  was indeed  lifted  necessarily implies  that the\n\nsecurity interest is valid.  \n\n          This argument is meritless for two reasons.  First,  it\n\nignores the  important distinction between  the consideration and\n\nadjudication of an  issue.  In  a relief  from stay hearing,  the\n\nonly  issue  properly before  the court,  and  thus the  only one\n\nactually  adjudicated,  is  whether  the stay  should  be  lifted\n\nbecause a creditor has shown a colorable claim.  Put another way,\n\nand employing the preliminary injunction analogy discussed above,\n\na  creditor must  show  a reasonable  likelihood  that it  has  a\n\nmeritorious claim,  and the  court may  consider any  defenses or\n\ncounterclaims that  bear on  whether  this reasonable  likelihood\n\nexists.  If  the stay is lifted, however, what  has been actually\n\nadjudicated  is only that the creditor  has shown this reasonable\n\nlikelihood.   It is not a ruling  on the merits of the underlying\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nclaim.9\n\n          Second, the Bank's argument also ignores the difference\n\nbetween  a void claim or lien, and a  valid yet voidable lien.  A\r                                                                  \n\ncreditor's valid,  perfected  security interest  in the  debtor's\n\nproperty may nevertheless be  voidable as a preferential transfer\n\nunder   547.  In  re Melon Produce, 976 F.2d at 74  (the creation\r                                            \n\nof  a  perfected  security  interest  in  property  is  itself  a\r                                                                        \n\npreference, when the perfection  takes place during the statutory\n\npreference period and other criteria  are satisfied).  A creditor\n\nmay therefore have a  lien that is sufficient to  justify lifting\n\nthe  stay,  yet   ultimately  avoidable  by  the   trustee  as  a\n\npreferential  transfer under   547.   Thus, the Bank's contention\n\nthat  \"if the creditor's security interest can be avoided for any\n\nreason, there is no cause to grant the creditor relief from stay\"\n\nis simply wrong. \n\n          The  only   case  that   the  Bank   cites  purportedly\n\nsupporting  its argument that  a relief from  stay proceeding can\n\nhave  preclusive effect  on a  subsequent counterclaim  is In  re\r                                                                           \n\nMonument Record Corp.,  71 B.R.   853 (Bankr.  M.D. Tenn.  1987).\r                               \n\nThis  case, however,  is entirely  distinguishable.   In Monument\r                                                                           \n\nRecord,  the creditor  and  the trustee  entered into  a specific\r                \n\n                    \r                              \n\n9   The Bank also urges  us to reject the  Vitreous Steel court's\r                                                                   \n\"rigid rule\"  and adopt a \"flexible approach\"  which takes unique\ncircumstances  into  account.   We  will  not, however,  overlook\nCongressional  intent,  statutory   language,  and   well-settled\nprocedural   machinery  that  all   limit  the   issues  properly\nadjudicated  in such hearings.  It is perhaps not surprising that\nthe  Bank fails to cite any authority for its \"flexible approach\"\nargument, as it lacks any legal or practical basis.\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nagreement, in order to  resolve the motion for relief  from stay,\n\nstipulating  that the  creditor's security  interest was  a valid\n\nfirst lien.   Id. at  855.  The  bankruptcy court held  that this\r                          \n\nspecific agreement  precluded the  trustee from challenging  in a\n\nlater  adversary  proceeding  the  perfection  of  the   security\n\ninterest.   Id.  at 864.    We agree  with the  Trustee that  the\r                        \n\nparties' express agreement  was the crux  of the Monument  Record\r                                                                           \n\ncourt's  ruling, and find  that decision is  logically limited to\n\nthose unique circumstances.    \n\n          Applying our holding to the facts presented here, it is\n\nevident that  the bankruptcy court's order  lifting the automatic\n\nstay upon the Bank's motion did not have preclusive effect on the\n\nTrustee's  counterclaims.   The  only issue  properly before  the\n\ncourt  during  that  hearing  was whether  the  Bank's  claim was\n\ncolorable, or  sufficiently plausible,  to lift  the  stay.   The\n\ncourt did not, and  indeed, could not adjudicate  the substantive\n\nmerits  of either the Bank's  claim, or any  possible defenses or\n\ncounterclaims.10    Thus,  the  issue  raised  by  the  Trustee's\n                    \r                              \n\n10  This is  so even if the Trustee had  attended the hearing and\nactually raised any defenses.  Thus, the Trustee's absence at the\nhearing  is  irrelevant.   The Bank  contends that  the Trustee's\nfailure  to deny the allegations in the Bank's motion for relief,\nand  to attend the hearing, constitutes a \"judicial admission\" of\nthe  validity of  the  Bank's security  interest.   The  Bank  is\nmisguided.    Because  a  court cannot  properly  adjudicate  the\nvalidity of a lien  during relief from stay proceedings,  a party\nalso  cannot  \"admit,\"  with  preclusive, binding  effect,  to  a\nclaim's validity.   See In re Torco Equip. Co.,  65 B.R. 353, 355\r                                                        \n(Bankr.  W.D. Ky.  1986) (preference  claim is  not a  compulsory\ncounterclaim  to a motion for relief because of the limited scope\nof   362 proceedings).  To hold otherwise would require a trustee\nto  plead  any and  all  affirmative  defenses and  counterclaims\nduring the relief  from stay proceedings,  or be forever  barred.\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\npreference counterclaim was  not before the  court at the  relief\n\nfrom  stay  hearing,  was   not  actually  (or  even  implicitly)\n\nlitigated,  and was not essential to the court's decision to lift\n\nthe  stay.  Therefore, the  elements of issue  preclusion are not\n\nmet here.11    Accordingly, both  the  bankruptcy court  and  the\n\ndistrict  court   erred  in   precluding   the  Trustee's   later\n\ncounterclaim on those grounds.\n\n                    \r                              \n\nAs we have explained, this is untenable.\n\n11   Moreover,  because  a  relief  from stay  proceeding  merely\nremoves a  bar to  a creditor  from  prosecuting its  substantive\nclaims,  and does  not  determine the  merits  of the  underlying\nclaim, there is no identity  of cause of action between a  relief\nfrom  stay proceeding and an adversary  proceeding on the claim's\nvalidity.   Thus, the  elements of claim  preclusion are likewise\nnot met here.\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\n          D.   The Trustee's   547 Preference Counterclaim\r                    D.

BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          On  January 26,  1988, the  Debtor signed  a $1,000,000\n\npromissory  note  in  favor  of  the  Bank.    The  Debtor  later\n\ncollaterally assigned various promissory notes and mortgages (the\n\n\"Seventeen Notes\") to  the Bank to  secure that debt.   Among the\n\nSeventeen  Notes was a $290,000 note  from the Wellesley Mortgage\n\nCorporation (the \"Wellesley Note\").  \n\n          On  September 4,  1992,  the Debtor  filed a  voluntary\n\npetition under Chapter 7  of the Bankruptcy Code, activating  the\n                    \r                              \n\n1   Unless otherwise noted,  all citations of  statutory sections\nare  to the Bankruptcy  Reform Act of  1978, 11 U.S.C.     101 et\r                                                                           \nseq., as amended.\r             \n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nautomatic stay provisions of    362.   On December 18, 1992,  the\n\nBank filed a Motion  for Relief from the Automatic  Stay pursuant\n\nto   362(d)(1),  seeking an order  allowing the Bank  to exercise\n\nits contractual  and state  law rights  and remedies against  the\n\nDebtor with respect  to the Seventeen Notes.2  In  its Motion for\n\nRelief, the  Bank claimed to have a \"perfected security interest\"\n\nin  the Seventeen  Notes because  it was  \"in sole  and exclusive\n\npossession\" of the  originals.  The Bank did not  state or allege\n\nany  other details  regarding its  security interest.   The  Bank\n\nasserted, as a  basis for relief, that  the Debtor was  unable to\n\nprovide  the Bank  with  adequate protection  for its  collateral\n\nposition.\n\n          In his Response  to the Bank's  Motion for Relief  from\n\nStay, the Trustee did  not contest the Bank's Motion,  but merely\n\nstated  that he  had  not  had  sufficient  time  to  review  the\n\npertinent  files  and determine  the  existence  of any  possible\n\ndefenses to the Bank's claims.  The Trustee then requested that a\n\npreliminary hearing on the  Motion be scheduled, after sufficient\n\ntime to review the files.\n\n          After a  hearing on the  Bank's Motion for  Relief from\n\n                    \r                              \n\n2  Section 362(d)(1) provides in pertinent part:\n\n            On  request  of a  party in  interest and\n            after notice  and  a hearing,  the  court\n            shall grant  relief from  the stay .  . .\n            for cause, including the lack of adequate\n            protection of an interest in  property of\n            such party in interest. . . .\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nStay  on  January 14,  1993,3  the Bankruptcy  Court  granted the\n\nMotion  and issued an order lifting the  automatic stay as to the\n\nBank, and  allowing  the Bank  to exercise  \"any and  all of  its\n\ncontractual and state  law rights and  remedies\" with respect  to\n\nthe Seventeen  Notes.  In neither  the hearing nor the  order did\n\nthe  bankruptcy court make any  findings about the  status of the\n\nBank's security interest in the Seventeen Notes.\n\n          Having  obtained relief  from  stay, the  Bank filed  a\n\nComplaint on February 19, 1993, requesting a determination of its\n\nsecured  status under   506(a),4 and a turnover and accounting of\n\nfunds by  the Trustee as to  the Seventeen Notes.   In support of\n\nits Complaint, the  Bank alleged  only that it  had a  \"perfected\n\nsecurity  interest\"  in the  Notes because  it  was \"in  sole and\n\nexclusive  possession\" of them.  Again, the Bank offered no other\n\ndetails or arguments regarding its interest in the Notes. \n\n          On  March 29,  1993,  the Trustee  answered the  Bank's\n\nComplaint (the  \"Answer\"), denying the Bank's  allegation that it\n\nhad a perfected security interest  in the Seventeen Notes because\n\nof  its  exclusive  possession.    The  Trustee  asserted  as  an\n\naffirmative defense  that the Bank  did not perfect  its security\n\n                    \r                              \n\n3  The Trustee did not attend this hearing, for  reasons that are\nunexplained in the record.  Both the Bank and  the district court\nmake much of his absence.  While we agree with the district court\nthat  a  trustee's  failure  to  attend  a  scheduled  hearing is\ntroubling and not to  be encouraged, we do  not find his  absence\nrelevant to our analysis here.\n\n4  Section  506 allows a  creditor to seek  determination of  the\nstatus of  a lien on property in which the debtor's estate has an\ninterest.\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ninterest in the Wellesley Note prior to 90 days before the Debtor\n\nfiled  its  bankruptcy petition.    The  Answer also  included  a\n\nCounterclaim, alleging that the  Bank's interest in the Wellesley\n\nNote is avoidable as a preferential transfer.5  \n\n          On  April  8, 1993,  the  Bank  answered the  Trustee's\n\ncounterclaim (the  \"Reply\").  The  Bank asserted, inter  alia, on\r                                                                       \n\nthe grounds of estoppel, waiver and collateral estoppel, that the\n\nTrustee  was barred  from  pursuing  his preference  counterclaim\n\nbecause he  failed to file or pursue  any objection to the Bank's\n\nMotion for Relief from Stay.\n\n          On July 7, 1993, the Trustee moved for summary judgment\n\non  his preference  counterclaim.   On August  3, 1993,  the Bank\n\nopposed  that motion and cross-moved  for summary judgment on the\n\nground that either res judicata or collateral estoppel barred the\r                                         \n\ncounterclaim,  as  the  issue of  the  \"validity\"  of  the Bank's\n\ninterest  in  the Notes  was  decided when  the  Bankruptcy Court\n\ngranted the relief from  stay.  The Bankruptcy Court  denied both\n\nsummary judgment motions, finding genuine issues of material fact\n\nto exist regarding \"the status of the holder of the note.\"   With\n\nrespect  to  the  Bank's  res judicata  and  collateral  estoppel\r                                                \n                    \r                              \n\n5   A \"preference\"  is a transfer  of a debtor's  assets during a\nspecified  pre-bankruptcy  period that  unjustifiably  favors the\ntransferee  over other creditors.

On the  first  page of  his\n\nMemorandum  of Law in support of the Motion for summary judgment,\n\nthe Trustee stated:\n\n            Only the note  entitled \"Wellesley  Mort.\n            Corp. of April  25, 1990\" (the  Wellesley\n            Note) . . . is presently in dispute.  The\n            other notes and mortgages . . . have been\n            determined   [by   the  Trustee]   to  be\n            perfected security interests in  favor of\n            [the Bank].\n\n          Three days  later, the Trustee filed a Motion for Leave\n\nto Amend his Memorandum  of Law, seeking to amend  this statement\n\nof facts.  The Trustee explained that the original memorandum was\n\nwritten  some months before, and at that time the Trustee thought\n\nthat there was  no dispute as to sixteen of  the Seventeen Notes.\n\nSometime after the original memorandum was written, but before it\n\nwas  filed, the Trustee apparently determined  that he did indeed\n\ndispute the Bank's interest  in the other notes as well,  but had\n\nneglected to edit his memorandum before filing it with the court.\n\nThe Bank objected to the Trustee's Motion for summary judgment on\n\nthe res judicata and  collateral estoppel issues, and cross-moved\r                          \n\nfor summary judgment.  \n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          After a  hearing on  the motions, the  bankruptcy court\n\ngranted  summary  judgment  in  favor  of  the  Bank.6    In  its\n\ndecision,  the  court  stated  without explanation  that  it  was\n\ntreating the Trustee's preference counterclaim as an \"affirmative\n\ndefense.\"   Although  the court  recognized that  the hearing  on\n\nrelief from  stay was a  preliminary one,  the court  went on  to\n\nstate:\n\n            The   question   of   the  validity   and\n            perfection of a  security interest  which\n            is the  subject of  a request  for relief\n            from stay goes to the heart of the issues\n            before  the court  [during a  relief from\n            stay hearing].   If the security interest\n            were invalid or unperfected,  there would\n            be no cause for  relief from stay and the\n            request  would  be denied  .  .  . .  The\n            Trustee could have raised  the perfection\n            issue    [underlying    his    preference\n            counterclaim]  at  the  hearing   on  the\n            motion for relief.  If he felt that I was\n            wrong in denying  him additional time  to\n            respond,  an  appeal  from my  order  was\n            appropriate.    Having had  the potential\n            for  one bite  at  the  apple, he  cannot\n            relitigate the issue at this time.\n\nThe  court reasoned  that the  perfection issue  was necessarily,\n\nimplicitly decided in the relief from stay  proceedings, and thus\n\ngranted  summary judgment in the  Bank's favor \"as  to the entire\n\nadversary  proceeding\"  on collateral  estoppel  or  res judicata\r                                                                           \n\ngrounds.\n\n          On May 23, 1994, the district court issued a Memorandum\n\nand  Order  affirming  the  bankruptcy  court's  decision.

Section\n\n546(a)(1).  A relief from stay proceeding, conversely, is usually\n\ncommenced very  shortly after  the bankruptcy petition  is filed,\n\nand, as explained  above, must  be completed no  more than  sixty\n\ndays from the filing of the  motion for relief.  Forcing trustees\n\nto raise  their counterclaims  within that short  period, usually\n\nduring the nascent stages  of a bankruptcy case, would  in effect\n\nallow  movant  creditors  to  drastically  reduce  the   two-year\n\nlimitations period  set forth  in  the Code.   Not  only is  this\n\nresult patently unfair and inefficient, it renders the Bankruptcy\n\nCode's statutes  of limitations provision irrelevant  -- a result\n\nwe cannot endorse.\n\n          For  all these  reasons, we  find that  a hearing  on a\n\nmotion for relief  from stay  is merely a  summary proceeding  of\n\nlimited effect, and adopt the Vitreous Steel court's holding that\r                                                      \n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\na court hearing a motion for relief from stay should seek only to\n\ndetermine whether the party seeking  relief has a colorable claim\n\nto property of the estate.  The statutory and procedural schemes,\n\nthe legislative history,  and the  case law all  direct that  the\n\nhearing on  a motion to  lift the  stay is not  a proceeding  for\n\ndetermining  the  merits of  the  underlying substantive  claims,\n\ndefenses,  or  counterclaims.    Rather,  it is  analogous  to  a\n\npreliminary   injunction   hearing,   requiring   a   speedy  and\n\nnecessarily  cursory determination  of the  reasonable likelihood\n\nthat  a creditor has a legitimate claim  or lien as to a debtor's\n\nproperty.8  If  a court finds that  likelihood to exist, this  is\n\nnot a determination of the validity of those claims, but merely a\n\ngrant  of permission  from the  court allowing  that  creditor to\n\nlitigate its substantive claims  elsewhere without violating  the\n\nautomatic stay.\n\n          This is not  to say  that bankruptcy  courts can  never\n\n                    \r                              \n\n8   Indeed, the legislative history  of   362  suggests this very\nanalogy:\n\n            [T]he  automatic  stay  is similar  to  a\n            temporary   restraining   order.      The\n            preliminary  hearing  [on  a  motion  for\n            relief  from  stay]  is  similar  to  the\n            hearing  on   a  preliminary  injunction,\n            . . . . The main difference lies in which\n            party  must bring  the  issue before  the\n            court.  While in the  injunction setting,\n            the  party  seeking  the injunction  must\n            prosecute the action, in  proceedings for\n            relief  from  the  automatic   stay,  the\n            enjoined party must move.  \n\nH.R.

For  example, if  a trustee\n\nraises a defense  to a creditor's claim  at the relief  from stay\n\nhearing, the court need not ignore this defense, but may consider\n\nit when deciding whether to lift the stay.  If, however, the stay\n\nis not lifted, that  creditor is not barred forever  from seeking\n\npayment.  It must simply comply with the automatic stay, and wait\n\nwith the other creditors for the estate's administration. \n\n          Conversely,  if the  stay is  lifted, the  creditor may\n\nthen prosecute its  claim in subsequent litigation.   The trustee\n\nis not precluded from raising  defenses or counterclaims in those\n\nsubsequent  proceedings,  because  the  defense  was  not   fully\n\nadjudicated, but only considered, during the preliminary hearing.\n\nAs  a  matter of  law, the  only  issue properly  and necessarily\n\nbefore a bankruptcy  court during relief from stay proceedings is\n\nwhether  the  movant  creditor  has a  colorable  claim;  thus, a\n\ndecision to lift the  stay is not an adjudication of the validity\n\nor avoidability of the  claim, but only a determination  that the\n\ncreditor's  claim   is  sufficiently  plausible   to  allow   its\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nprosecution elsewhere.\n\n          The Bank  nevertheless submits that the  Vitreous Steel\r                                                                           \n\nanalysis is \"flawed,\" and argues:\n\n            [A] determination (though not necessarily\n            a final one) as  to a creditor's security\n            interest  is  an  integral  part  of  any\r                                  \n            decision  regarding  the  lifting of  the\n            stay .  . .  if  the creditor's  security\n            interest  can be avoided  for any reason,\n            there is no cause  to grant the  creditor\n            relief  from  stay  because the  creditor\n            lacks   an   interest  in   the  debtor's\n            property.  \n\n(Emphasis  in original).    Essentially, the  Bank contends  that\n\nbecause  establishing  the  validity  of  a  creditor's  security\n\ninterest is an essential element of a relief from  stay, the fact\n\nthat  the stay  was indeed  lifted  necessarily implies  that the\n\nsecurity interest is valid.  \n\n          This argument is meritless for two reasons.  First,  it\n\nignores the  important distinction between  the consideration and\n\nadjudication of an  issue.  In  a relief  from stay hearing,  the\n\nonly  issue  properly before  the court,  and  thus the  only one\n\nactually  adjudicated,  is  whether  the stay  should  be  lifted\n\nbecause a creditor has shown a colorable claim.  Put another way,\n\nand employing the preliminary injunction analogy discussed above,\n\na  creditor must  show  a reasonable  likelihood  that it  has  a\n\nmeritorious claim,  and the  court may  consider any  defenses or\n\ncounterclaims that  bear on  whether  this reasonable  likelihood\n\nexists.  If  the stay is lifted, however, what  has been actually\n\nadjudicated  is only that the creditor  has shown this reasonable\n\nlikelihood.   It is not a ruling  on the merits of the underlying\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nclaim.9\n\n          Second, the Bank's argument also ignores the difference\n\nbetween  a void claim or lien, and a  valid yet voidable lien.  A\r                                                                  \n\ncreditor's valid,  perfected  security interest  in the  debtor's\n\nproperty may nevertheless be  voidable as a preferential transfer\n\nunder   547.

The  only issue  properly before  the\n\ncourt  during  that  hearing  was whether  the  Bank's  claim was\n\ncolorable, or  sufficiently plausible,  to lift  the  stay.   The\n\ncourt did not, and  indeed, could not adjudicate  the substantive\n\nmerits  of either the Bank's  claim, or any  possible defenses or\n\ncounterclaims.10    Thus,  the  issue  raised  by  the  Trustee's\n                    \r                              \n\n10  This is  so even if the Trustee had  attended the hearing and\nactually raised any defenses.  Thus, the Trustee's absence at the\nhearing  is  irrelevant.   The Bank  contends that  the Trustee's\nfailure  to deny the allegations in the Bank's motion for relief,\nand  to attend the hearing, constitutes a \"judicial admission\" of\nthe  validity of  the  Bank's security  interest.   The  Bank  is\nmisguided.    Because  a  court cannot  properly  adjudicate  the\nvalidity of a lien  during relief from stay proceedings,  a party\nalso  cannot  \"admit,\"  with  preclusive, binding  effect,  to  a\nclaim's validity.

W.D. Ky.  1986) (preference  claim is  not a  compulsory\ncounterclaim  to a motion for relief because of the limited scope\nof   362 proceedings).  To hold otherwise would require a trustee\nto  plead  any and  all  affirmative  defenses and  counterclaims\nduring the relief  from stay proceedings,  or be forever  barred.\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\npreference counterclaim was  not before the  court at the  relief\n\nfrom  stay  hearing,  was   not  actually  (or  even  implicitly)\n\nlitigated,  and was not essential to the court's decision to lift\n\nthe  stay.  Therefore, the  elements of issue  preclusion are not\n\nmet here.11    Accordingly, both  the  bankruptcy court  and  the\n\ndistrict  court   erred  in   precluding   the  Trustee's   later\n\ncounterclaim on those grounds.\n\n                    \r                              \n\nAs we have explained, this is untenable.\n\n11   Moreover,  because  a  relief  from stay  proceeding  merely\nremoves a  bar to  a creditor  from  prosecuting its  substantive\nclaims,  and does  not  determine the  merits  of the  underlying\nclaim, there is no identity  of cause of action between a  relief\nfrom  stay proceeding and an adversary  proceeding on the claim's\nvalidity.   Thus, the  elements of claim  preclusion are likewise\nnot met here.\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\n          D.   The Trustee's   547 Preference Counterclaim\r                    D.

The Wellesley Note\n\n          With respect to the Trustee's counterclaim under   547,\n\nthe  bankruptcy court ruled that a genuine issue of material fact\n\nexists as  to the status of  the Bank's security interest  in the\n\nWellesley  Note, and we find that the record supports the court's\n\nfinding.12    We  therefore remand  the  case  to the  bankruptcy\n\ncourt for further proceedings on the validity of the Bank's claim\n\nand the Trustee's counterclaim as to the Wellesley Note.\n\n            2.  The other sixteen of the Seventeen Notes  \r                      2.  The other sixteen of the Seventeen Notes\n\n          Regarding  the parties' dispute  over the other sixteen\n\nof the Seventeen Notes, the Trustee requests, in the \"Conclusion\"\n\nsection  of his  brief,  that we  \"strike  any finding  that  the\n\nTrustee  has  agreed  that  the Seventeen  Notes  other  than the\n\nWellesley  Note are  'valid'  security interests.\"    In a  final\n\nfootnote to his reply brief, the Trustee maintains that he is not\n\ncontending that his motion to amend should have been allowed, but\n\nonly that genuine factual issues exist regarding the validity, as\r                                                                       \n\nopposed  to the perfection, of the other sixteen of the Seventeen\n\nNotes, and thus summary  judgment as to those notes  is improper.\n\nHe offers no further support for this statement. \n\n          Regardless  of the  meaning or  merit of  the Trustee's\n                    \r                              \n\n12   While  the Bank contends  that its security  interest in the\nWellesley Note  was perfected by  possession prior to  the 90-day\nstatutory preference  period, the Trustee contends  that the Bank\ndid  not actually  have possession  of the  Note until  about two\nmonths before  the Debtor filed  its bankruptcy  petition.   Both\nparties'  contentions have support in the record, thus creating a\ngenuine factual issue.\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nargument as to the other sixteen of the Seventeen Notes, we agree\n\nwith  the Bank  that the  Trustee has  not properly  presented or\n\nargued  this  issue on  appeal.   We  have warned  litigants that\n\nissues averted to  in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some\n\neffort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived for purposes\n\nof appeal.   Willhauck v.

Even  when  the Bank  pointed  out this  flaw,  the\n\nTrustee  did not  more fully  develop the  argument in  his reply\n\nbrief, but  deemed it worthy of only a cursory footnote.  This is\n\nsimply insufficient  presentation and argumentation of  the issue\n\nfor any meaningful analysis,  and we therefore deem  it waived.13\n\n                         III.

CONCLUSION\n\n          For the  foregoing reasons,  we conclude that  both the\n\nbankruptcy  court and  the district  court erred  in barring  the\n\nTrustee's preference counterclaim as to the Wellesley Note on the\n\ngrounds of  either claim  or issue  preclusion.
