Plaintiff has appealed from an order of the\r                           \n\nbankruptcy court  granting relief from the  automatic stay in\n\nher Chapter 7  bankruptcy proceeding.  While  this appeal was\n\npending  before  the district  court,  plaintiff's Chapter  7\n\npetition  was dismissed  by the  bankruptcy court;  no appeal\n\nfrom  such dismissal  was  ever filed.    We agree  with  the\n\ndistrict  court that,  once the  dismissal of  the underlying\n\nbankruptcy proceeding became final, the instant appeal became\n\nmoot.  As the  court stated under analogous circumstances  in\n\nIn  re Income Property Builders, Inc., 699 F.2d 963 (9th Cir.\r                                                 \n\n1982) (per curiam):\n\n     [T]he automatic stay provided in 11 U.S.C.   362(a)\n     was dependent upon the operation of  the bankruptcy\n     law, and that law was pertinent only because of the\n     existence of the proceeding in bankruptcy....   Any\n     power  that we  have with  respect to  the stay  is\n     derived  from our  appellate  power  in  bankruptcy\n     matters.    Once the  bankruptcy  was  dismissed, a\n     bankruptcy court  no longer had power  to order the\n     stay or to award damages allegedly  attributable to\n     its vacation.   A  remand by  us to  the bankruptcy\n     court would therefore be useless.\n\nId.  at 964;  accord,  e.g., Olive  Street  Invest., Inc.  v.\r                                                                     \n\nHoward Savings Bank,  972 F.2d  214, 215-16  (8th Cir.  1992)\r                               \n\n(per  curiam); In re Universal Farming Indus., 873 F.2d 1332,\r                                                         \n\n1333 (9th  Cir. 1989); cf.
