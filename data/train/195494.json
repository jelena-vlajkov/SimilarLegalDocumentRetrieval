Wayne Straw appeals his conviction and\n                    \n\nsentence  for illegal  reentry into  the United  States after\n\ndeportation, 8 U.S.C.    1326.  We  summarily affirm pursuant\n\nto Loc. R. 27.1. \n\n                          Background\n                                    \n\n     On January  11, 1990, the United  States Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service deported Straw  from the United States\n\nto Jamaica.  Prior  to his deportation, Straw had  been twice\n\nconvicted in  Dorchester  District Court  for  possession  of\n\nmarijuana  (once in 1981 and again in 1982).  Straw was found\n\nin  the United  States in  February, 1993.   A  federal grand\n\njury, in  a one-count  indictment, charged him  with unlawful\n\nreentry after deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C.    1326(a)\n\nand (b)(2).   Straw pleaded  guilty, preserving his  right to\n\nappeal his sentence.\n\n     Adopting the factual findings and recommended sentencing\n\nguideline  application  contained   in  Straw's   presentence\n\nreport, the  district court  increased  Straw's base  offense\n\nlevel by 16, pursuant  to U.S.S.G.   2L1.2, on account of his\n\n1981 and 1982 convictions for \"aggravated felonies.\"  A total\n\noffense  level of 21 and  a criminal history  category of III\n\nyielded an imprisonment range of 46  to 57 months.  The court\n\nsentenced Straw to 46 months in prison.\n\n                             -2-\n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n     Straw argues  on appeal that the  sentencing court erred\n\nin increasing his  base offense level pursuant  to U.S.S.G.  \n\n2L1.2, which provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n     (2) If  the defendant previously was deported after\n     a conviction for an aggravated felony,  increase by\n     16 levels.\n\nThe statutory authority for this guideline provision is found\n\nin 8 U.S.C.    1326(b), which imposes a maximum penalty of 15\n\nyears for the crime  of illegal reentry following deportation\n\n\"subsequent to  a conviction for commission  of an aggravated\n\nfelony.\"  8 U.S.C.   1326(b)(2).   The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of\n\n1988 (the \"ADAA\") added subsection (b) to   1326. \n\n     On appeal,  Straw contends, as he did  at his sentencing\n\nhearing, that the use of his prior convictions to enhance his\n\nsentence under   1326(b)(2) violates the ex post facto clause\n\nof the Constitution.   Specifically, Straw argues that at the\n\ntime  of  his  convictions  for  marijuana  possession, those\n\noffenses did not constitute \"aggravated felonies.\"  Not until\n\n1988, when Congress  enacted the ADAA,  did the law  classify\n\npossession of marijuana as  an \"aggravated felony,\" enhancing\n\nthe penalty for illegal reentry.  See 8 U.S.C.    1101(a)(43)\n                                     \n\nand  1326(b)(2).   Therefore, Straw  reasons, to  enhance his\n\nsentence based upon convictions that pre-dated  the amendment\n\nadding the  enhanced penalty  provision would violate  the ex\n\npost  facto  clause's prohibition  against  the retrospective\n\n                             -3-\n\napplication   of  laws   that  materially   disadvantage  the\n\ndefendant. See U.S. Const. art. I,   9, cl. 3. \n              \n\n       We recently  rejected an identical  argument in United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.  Forbes, 16  F.3d  1294 (1st  Cir.  1994).   As we\n                  \n\nreasoned  there,  the  enhancement  provision  increases  the\n\npunishment for  the crime of  unlawful reentry  and does  not\n\naffect the punishment that Straw received for the offenses he\n\ncommitted before the effective  date of the ADAA. See  id. at\n                                                          \n\n1302.  \"As the Gryger  [v. Burke, 334 U.S. 728 (1948)]  Court\n                                \n\nobserved, the fact that  prior convictions that factored into\n\na defendant's increased sentence preceded the enactment of an\n\nenhancement  provision does  not  render  the  Act  invalidly\n\nretroactive.\" Id.  Therefore, we hold that Straw's conviction\n                 \n\nand sentence do not violate the ex post facto clause.\n\n     To  the extent  that  appellant argues,  as a  matter of\n\nstatutory  construction,  that  Congress  did  not  intend   \n\n1326(b)(2)  to apply  retroactively  to a  defendant who  was\n\nconvicted  and deported  prior to  enactment of the  ADDA, we\n\nhave  also recently  rejected precisely  that argument.   See\n                                                             \n\nUnited  States v. Troncoso, No.  93-2130, slip op.  at 8 (1st\n                          \n\nCir. May 18, 1994); see also United States v. Forbes, 16 F.3d\n                                                    \n\n1294  (upholding  application   of     1326(b)(2)  based   on\n\naggravated   felony  convictions   that  occurred   prior  to\n\neffective date of ADAA).\n\n                             -4-\n\n     Straw's  final argument  is  that the  \"rule of  lenity\"\n\nshould bar  the application  of the enhancement  provision in\n\nthis  case.    The  rule   of  lenity  requires,  in  certain\n\ncircumstances, that ambiguity in criminal statutes, including\n\nsentencing provisions,  be resolved in defendant's favor. See\n                                                             \n\nUnited States  v. Granderson, 114  S. Ct. 1259,  1267 (1994);\n                            \n\nUnited States v.  Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347  (1971).  Straw has\n                      \n\nfailed to convince us, however, that there is ambiguity about\n\nwhether    1326(b) was intended  to apply to  a defendant who\n\nwas convicted and  deported prior to  enactment of the  ADDA,\n\nbut illegally reentered the country thereafter.   In   United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Troncoso, No.  93-2130, slip op. at 8,  we affirmed\n                  \n\nthe district court's application of   1326(b)(2) to enhance a\n\nsentence  for  illegal  reentry  by an  alien  convicted  and\n\ndeported prior to the ADAA's enactment, based upon the \"plain\n\nmeaning  of the  provision.\"   We noted  there that  \"the Act\n\nprovided  that the  amendment  adding section  1326(b) 'shall\n\napply to any alien who enters, attempts to enter, or is found\n\nin,  the United States on or after  the date of the enactment\n\nof this  Act.'\" Id. at 6.  The rule of lenity \"cannot dictate\n                   \n\nan implausible interpretation of  a statute . . .  .\"  Taylor\n                                                             \n\nv.

Therefore, we\n                \n\ndecline Straw's invitation to apply the rule of lenity here.\n\n     For  the  foregoing   reasons,  Straw's  conviction  and\n\nsentence are summarily affirmed pursuant to Loc.

Sec. 2L1.2, on account of his 1981 and 1982 convictions for \"aggravated felonies.\"  A total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of III yielded an imprisonment range of 46 to 57 months.  The court sentenced Straw to 46 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Straw argues on appeal that the sentencing court erred in increasing his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2, which provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) If the defendant previously was deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony, increase by 16 levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory authority for this guideline provision is found in 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b), which imposes a maximum penalty of 15 years for the crime of illegal reentry following deportation \"subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony.\"  8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(2).  The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (the \"ADAA\") added subsection (b) to Sec. 1326.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Straw contends, as he did at his sentencing hearing, that the use of his prior convictions to enhance his sentence under Sec. 1326(b)(2) violates the ex post facto clause of the Constitution.  Specifically, Straw argues that at the time of his convictions for marijuana possession, those offenses did not constitute \"aggravated felonies.\"  Not until 1988, when Congress enacted the ADAA, did the law classify possession of marijuana as an \"aggravated felony,\" enhancing the penalty for illegal reentry.  See 8 U.S.C. Secs. 1101(a)(43) and 1326(b)(2).  Therefore, Straw reasons, to enhance his sentence based upon convictions that pre-dated the amendment adding the enhanced penalty provision would violate the ex post facto clause's prohibition against the retrospective application of laws that materially disadvantage the defendant.  See U.S. Const. art.  I, Sec. 9, cl. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recently rejected an identical argument in  United States v. Forbes, 16 F.3d 1294 (1st Cir. 1994).  As we reasoned there, the enhancement provision increases the punishment for the crime of unlawful reentry and does not affect the punishment that Straw received for the offenses he committed before the effective date of the ADAA.  See id. at 1302.  \"As the Gryger [v.  Burke, 334 U.S. 728 (1948) ] Court observed, the fact that prior convictions that factored into a defendant's increased sentence preceded the enactment of an enhancement provision does not render the Act invalidly retroactive.\"  Id.

See United States v. Troncoso, No. 93-2130, slip op. at 8 (1st Cir.  May 18, 1994);   see also United States v. Forbes, 16 F.3d 1294 (upholding application of Sec. 1326(b)(2) based on aggravated felony convictions that occurred prior to effective date of ADAA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Straw's final argument is that the \"rule of lenity\" should bar the application of the enhancement provision in this case.  The rule of lenity requires, in certain circumstances, that ambiguity in criminal statutes, including sentencing provisions, be resolved in defendant's favor.   See United States v. Granderson, 114 S. Ct. 1259, 1267 (1994);   United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347 (1971).  Straw has failed to convince us, however, that there is ambiguity about whether Sec. 1326(b) was intended to apply to a defendant who was convicted and deported prior to enactment of the ADDA, but illegally reentered the country thereafter.  In United States v. Troncoso, No. 93-2130, slip op. at 8, we affirmed the district court's application of Sec. 1326(b)(2) to enhance a sentence for illegal reentry by an alien convicted and deported prior to the ADAA's enactment, based upon the \"plain meaning of the provision.\"  We noted there that \"the Act provided that the amendment adding section 1326(b) 'shall apply to any alien who enters, attempts to enter, or is found in, the United States on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.' \"  Id. at 6. The rule of lenity \"cannot dictate an implausible interpretation of a statute....\"   Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 596 (1990).

Sec. 2L1.2, on account of his 1981 and 1982 convictions for \"aggravated felonies.\"  A total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of III yielded an imprisonment range of 46 to 57 months.  The court sentenced Straw to 46 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Straw argues on appeal that the sentencing court erred in increasing his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2, which provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) If the defendant previously was deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony, increase by 16 levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory authority for this guideline provision is found in 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b), which imposes a maximum penalty of 15 years for the crime of illegal reentry following deportation \"subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony.\"  8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(2).  The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (the \"ADAA\") added subsection (b) to Sec. 1326.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Straw contends, as he did at his sentencing hearing, that the use of his prior convictions to enhance his sentence under Sec. 1326(b)(2) violates the ex post facto clause of the Constitution.  Specifically, Straw argues that at the time of his convictions for marijuana possession, those offenses did not constitute \"aggravated felonies.\"  Not until 1988, when Congress enacted the ADAA, did the law classify possession of marijuana as an \"aggravated felony,\" enhancing the penalty for illegal reentry.  See 8 U.S.C. Secs. 1101(a)(43) and 1326(b)(2).  Therefore, Straw reasons, to enhance his sentence based upon convictions that pre-dated the amendment adding the enhanced penalty provision would violate the ex post facto clause's prohibition against the retrospective application of laws that materially disadvantage the defendant.  See U.S. Const. art.  I, Sec. 9, cl. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recently rejected an identical argument in  United States v. Forbes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195227\"><a href=\"/opinion/195227/united-states-v-forbes/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1294</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1994).  As we reasoned there, the enhancement provision increases the punishment for the crime of unlawful reentry and does not affect the punishment that Straw received for the offenses he committed before the effective date of the ADAA.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195227\"><a href=\"/opinion/195227/united-states-v-forbes/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1302. </a></span> \"As the Gryger [v.

See United States v. Troncoso, No. 93-2130, slip op. at 8 (1st Cir.  May 18, 1994);   see also United States v. Forbes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195227\"><a href=\"/opinion/195227/united-states-v-forbes/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1294</span> </a></span>(upholding application of Sec. 1326(b)(2) based on aggravated felony convictions that occurred prior to effective date of ADAA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Straw's final argument is that the \"rule of lenity\" should bar the application of the enhancement provision in this case.  The rule of lenity requires, in certain circumstances, that ambiguity in criminal statutes, including sentencing provisions, be resolved in defendant's favor.   See United States v. Granderson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117832\"><a href=\"/opinion/117832/united-states-v-granderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1259</span></a></span>, 1267 (1994);   United States v. Bass, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108421\"><a href=\"/opinion/108421/united-states-v-bass/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span>, 347 (1971).  Straw has failed to convince us, however, that there is ambiguity about whether Sec. 1326(b) was intended to apply to a defendant who was convicted and deported prior to enactment of the ADDA, but illegally reentered the country thereafter.  In United States v. Troncoso, No. 93-2130, slip op. at 8, we affirmed the district court's application of Sec. 1326(b)(2) to enhance a sentence for illegal reentry by an alien convicted and deported prior to the ADAA's enactment, based upon the \"plain meaning of the provision.\"  We noted there that \"the Act provided that the amendment adding section 1326(b) 'shall apply to any alien who enters, attempts to enter, or is found in, the United States on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.' \"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108421\"><a href=\"/opinion/108421/united-states-v-bass/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 6. </a></span>The rule of lenity \"cannot dictate an implausible interpretation of a statute....\"   Taylor v.

Therefore, we decline Straw's invitation to apply the rule of lenity here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, Straw's conviction and sentence are summarily affirmed pursuant to Loc.
