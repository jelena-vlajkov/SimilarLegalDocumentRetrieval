The  issue  presented in  this\n     SELYA,  Circuit  Judge.\n                           \n\nappeal is whether the defendants, parole officers, violated a\n\nclearly   established  constitutional   right   of  which   a\n\nreasonable person would have known when, in August 1989, they\n\narrested plaintiff Stephen S. Crooker  at his home for sundry\n\nparole violations.  The officers conducted a protective sweep\n\nincident to  the  arrest.   Stephen  Crooker  and  his  wife,\n\nPamela, brought suit, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.    1983, alleging\n\nthat  the  search  violated  their  Fourth Amendment  rights.\n\nParticularly, they allege that,  during the sweep, an officer\n\nlifted  their mattress from its box spring and looked between\n\nthe two.1   The district  court denied the  defendants' claim\n\nof qualified immunity.  The defendants appeal.  We reverse.\n\n     When defendants executed the  arrest warrant for Stephen\n\nCrooker,  they  \"possesse[d]  a  reasonable belief  based  on\n\nspecific and articulable facts which, taken together with the\n\nrational inferences from those facts,  reasonably warrant[ed]\n\nthe   officer[s]  in  believing,\"  that  the  Crookers'  home\n\nharbored an  individual, one Vincent Tondryk,  who \"pos[ed] a\n\ndanger to the officer[s]  or others.\"  Maryland v.  Buie, 494\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 325,  327 (1990) (citations omitted);  see also Michigan\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n1.  The  defendants  deny that,  in  fact,  the mattress  was\nlifted from  the box  spring.   That factual  dispute remains\nunresolved.   Our  determination  of the  issue of  qualified\nimmunity  does not depend on resolution of that dispute as we\nassume  arguendo that the  mattress search took  place in the\n                \nmanner asserted by the plaintiffs.\n\n                             -2-\n\nv.  Long, 463 U.S. 1032,  1049-50 (1983); Terry  v. Ohio, 392\n                                                        \n\nU.S.  1,  21 (1968).    This  reasonable  belief permitted  a\n\nprotective sweep of the premises,  i.e., \"a quick and limited\n                                       \n\nsearch of premises, incident to [the] arrest and conducted to\n\nprotect  the safety of police officers or others.\"  Buie, 494\n                                                        \n\nU.S. at 327; see also United States v. Curzi, 867 F.2d 36, 39\n                                            \n\nn.2  (1st  Cir.  1989).    The  defendants,  therefore,  were\n\njustified  in searching  the Crookers'  home for  Tondryk and\n\nlooking  in  places where  Tondryk  might  have been  hiding.\n\nAlthough the district court  so found, it nevertheless denied\n\nthe  defendants' claim  of qualified  immunity on  the ground\n\nthat the search between  the mattress and box spring  was not\n\nwithin the  proper confines of a protective  sweep because it\n\nwould not  be reasonable to expect  a person to be  hiding in\n\nthose environs.  Thus, the court reasoned, the search was not\n\npermissible in the absence of a search warrant.\n\n     It  is  true  that  Buie speaks  of  a  protective sweep\n                             \n\n\"narrowly confined  to a  cursory visual inspection  of those\n\nplaces in which a person might be hiding.\"  Buie, 494 U.S. at\n                                                \n\n327.  The facts of  Buie, however, did not present the  issue\n                        \n\nof  the permissibility  of  a limited  search for  accessible\n\nweapons (which  it is  not  unreasonable to  expect might  be\n\nhidden   between  a  mattress   and  box   spring)  conducted\n\nsimultaneously with the search for a dangerous confederate of\n\nthe arrestee.   Thus, we  cannot say, even  today, that  Buie\n                                                             \n\n                             -3-\n\nforecloses the  possibility that  such a scenario  is lawful.\n\nIndeed,  the  Second  Circuit  recently  determined   that  a\n\nprotective sweep can include a search for weapons within easy\n                    \n\nreach  of an  individual  whom the  officers have  reasonably\n\nconcluded is dangerous.  See  United States v. Hernandez, 941\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  133,  137 (2d  Cir. 1991);  see  also United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nLopez,  989  F.2d 24  (1st  Cir. 1993)  (upholding  a weapons\n     \n\nsearch  where the police had ample basis for believing that a\n\ndangerous  weapon was  lodged  close by,  that the  defendant\n\nmight not be  acting alone,  and that the  premises were  not\n\nsecure),  petition for cert. filed, (U.S. Jun. 23, 1993) (No.\n                                  \n\n93-5032); cf.

See,\n                                                             \n\ne.g., Quintero de Quintero v.

The\n                              \n\nprotective  sweep in  Hernandez  occurred, like  the  instant\n                               \n\nsweep,  in  1989, and,  significantly,  that  court drew  its\n\nreasoning not only  from Buie, but also from Long and Terry -\n                                                           \n\ntwo opinions of the Court that predated 1989 and dwelt on the\n\nbalance  that  must  be  struck  between  the  need  for  law\n\nenforcement officers to protect themselves and others and the\n\ninvasion which a search entails.  See Long, 463 U.S. at 1049-\n                                          \n\n52;  Terry,  392 U.S.  at 23-27;  see  also United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nElkins, 732  F.2d 1280,  1285 (6th Cir.  1984) (\"Once  having\n      \n\nentered the premises, the agents were then required to secure\n                                                   \n\nall  persons therein and to  make a protective  sweep for the\n\nweapons  Elkins was  known to  favor, for  the safety  of all\n\nconcerned.\") (Emphasis supplied).\n\n     In sum,  it may  well be that,  during the course  of an\n\notherwise   justified  protective   sweep  for   a  dangerous\n\nindividual,  thought to  be in  hiding, the  Fourth Amendment\n\npermits a simultaneously conducted  limited search of  places\n\nwhich might contain  a weapon readily accessible to  that as-\n\nyet-undiscovered individual.  We need  not, and do not, reach\n\nthat  question  in  this  case, however,  for  the  operative\n\ninquiry on  qualified immunity is not  whether the defendants\n\nactually abridged the  plaintiffs' constitutional rights, but\n\nwhether  defendants'  conduct  was objectively  unreasonable,\n\n                             -5-\n\ngiven the constitutional  understandings then  current.   See\n                                                             \n\nAnderson v.  Creighton, 483  U.S. 635, 640  (1987); Davis  v.\n                                                         \n\nScherer, 468 U.S. 183, 190  (1984); Quintero de Quintero, 974\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at  228; Amsden, 904 F.2d at  751.  The uncertainty that\n                    \n\nshrouds  the  question  here  means,  a  fortiori,  that  the\n                                                 \n\ndefendants, in  1989, violated no clearly  established Fourth\n\nAmendment right of which reasonable officers would have known\n\nwhen  they  searched between  the  mattress  and box  spring.\n\nAfter  all,  a state  actor is  neither  expected to  carry a\n\ncrystal  ball nor \"to determine the manner in which the law's\n\ngrey  areas will be clarified and defined.\"  Borucki v. Ryan,\n                                                            \n\n827 F.2d 836, 838 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n     Finally, we believe it is important to note that nothing\n\napproaching  a  full scale  search  occurred  in this  case.2\n\nStephen Crooker acknowledged that  the officers' sweep of the\n\npremises,  including  the basement,  took  only  five to  ten\n\nminutes,  and  that  the  officers spent  only  \"a  couple of\n\nminutes\" in the bedroom.   Apart from the search  between the\n\nmattress and box spring, nothing in  the record suggests that\n\nthe  officers  were  rummaging  aimlessly  about.    This  is\n\npersuasive proof that safety, not  a search for evidence, was\n\n                    \n\n2.  We think  it is useful  to contrast what  transpired here\nwith the search  conducted in Chimel v.  California, 395 U.S.\n                                                   \n752  (1969).   That foray  lasted between  45 minutes  and an\nhour, id. at 754,  and comprised \"a full-blown search  of the\n         \nentire house for evidence  of the crime for which  the arrest\nwas made.\"  Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. at 336.\n                            \n\n                             -6-\n\nthe  impetus for,  and guiding  force behind,  the protective\n\nsweep at  issue here.  The Court has taught that a protective\n\n\"sweep  lasts  no longer  than  is  necessary to  dispel  the\n\nreasonable  suspicion of  danger and in  any event  no longer\n\nthan  it  takes  to  complete   the  arrest  and  depart  the\n\npremises.\"  Buie, 494 U.S. at 335-36.  The sweep conducted by\n                \n\nthe defendants in this case fulfilled these criteria.\n\n     We need go no  further.3  Because the record, read as it\n\nmust  be, in the light most flattering to the plaintiffs, see\n                                                             \n\nQuintero de Quintero, 974  F.2d at 227-28, shows conclusively\n                    \n\nthat the  defendants are entitled to  qualified immunity, the\n\ndistrict  court erred  in  denying their  motion for  summary\n\njudgment.\n\n     Reversed.\n              \n\n                    \n\n3.  In view of the result that we reach, we need not  address\ndefendants' asseveration, premised  on cases such  as Griffin\n                                                             \nv.

Crooker at his home for sundry parole violations.  The officers conducted a protective sweep incident to the arrest.  Stephen Crooker and his wife, Pamela, brought suit, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, alleging that the search violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  Particularly, they allege that, during the sweep, an officer lifted their mattress from its box spring and looked between the two.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The district court denied the defendants' claim of qualified immunity.

Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 327, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 1094, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990) (citations omitted);  see alsoMichigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 1049-50, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 3480-81, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983);  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1880, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).  This reasonable belief permitted a protective sweep of the premises, i.e., \"a quick and limited search of premises, incident to [the] arrest and conducted to protect the safety of police officers or others.\"  Buie, 494 U.S. at 327, 110 S.Ct. at 1094;  see alsoUnited States v. Curzi, 867 F.2d 36, 39 n. 2 (1st Cir.1989).  The defendants, therefore, were justified in searching the Crookers' home for Tondryk and looking in places where Tondryk might have been hiding.  Although the district court so found, it nevertheless denied the defendants' claim of qualified immunity on the ground that the search between the mattress and box spring was not within the proper confines of a protective sweep because it would not be reasonable to expect a person to be hiding in those environs.  Thus, the court reasoned, the search was not permissible in the absence of a search warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that Buie speaks of a protective sweep \"narrowly confined to a cursory visual inspection of those places in which a person might be hiding.\"  Buie, 494 U.S. at 327, 110 S.Ct. at 1094.   The facts of Buie, however, did not present the issue of the permissibility of a limited search for accessible weapons (which it is not unreasonable to expect might be hidden between a mattress and box spring) conducted simultaneously with the search for a dangerous confederate of the arrestee.  Thus, we cannot say, even today, that Buie forecloses the possibility that such a scenario is lawful.  Indeed, the Second Circuit recently determined that a protective sweep can include a search for weapons within easy reach of an individual whom the officers have reasonably concluded is dangerous.  SeeUnited States v. Hernandez, 941 F.2d 133, 137 (2d Cir.1991);  see alsoUnited States v. Lopez, 989 F.2d 24 (1st Cir.1993) (upholding a weapons search where the police had ample basis for believing that a dangerous weapon was lodged close by, that the defendant might not be acting alone, and that the premises were not secure), petition for cert. filed, (U.S. Jun. 23, 1993) (No. 93-5032);  cf.United States v. Irizarry, 673 F.2d 554, 559 n* (1st Cir.1982) (suggesting that a search for weapons would be unjustified where all persons in a hotel room were under control and the agents knew that no one else was on the premises).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In analyzing a claim of qualified immunity, moreover, we are concerned with clearly established constitutional or statutory rights of which a reasonable officer would have known at the time he took action, here, in August 1989.  See, e.g.,Quintero de Quintero v. Aponte-Roque, 974 F.2d 226, 228 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that \"the touchstone of an inquiry into qualified immunity is whether the state actor's behavior was objectively reasonable, as a matter of federal law, at the time and under the circumstances then obtaining\");  Amsden v. Moran, 904 F.2d 748, 751 (1st Cir.1990) (similar), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1041, 111 S.Ct. 713, 112 L.Ed.2d 702 (1991).  The protective sweep in Hernandez occurred, like the instant sweep, in 1989, and, significantly, that court drew its reasoning not only from Buie, but also from Long and Terry--two opinions of the Court that predated 1989 and dwelt on the balance that must be struck between the need for law enforcement officers to protect themselves and others and the invasion which a search entails.  SeeLong, 463 U.S. at 1049-52, 103 S.Ct. at 3480-83;  Terry, 392 U.S. at 23-27, 88 S.Ct. at 1881-83;  see alsoUnited States v. Elkins, 732 F.2d 1280, 1285 (6th Cir.1984) (\"Once having entered the premises, the agents were then required to secure all persons therein and to make a protective sweep for the weapons Elkins was known to favor, for the safety of all concerned.\")  (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, it may well be that, during the course of an otherwise justified protective sweep for a dangerous individual, thought to be in hiding, the Fourth Amendment permits a simultaneously conducted limited search of places which might contain a weapon readily accessible to that as-yet-undiscovered individual.  We need not, and do not, reach that question in this case, however, for the operative inquiry on qualified immunity is not whether the defendants actually abridged the plaintiffs' constitutional rights, but whether defendants' conduct was objectively unreasonable, given the constitutional understandings then current.  SeeAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3039, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987);  Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 190, 104 S.Ct. 3012, 3017, 82 L.Ed.2d 139 (1984);  Quintero de Quintero, 974 F.2d at 228;  Amsden, 904 F.2d at 751.   The uncertainty that shrouds the question here means, a fortiori, that the defendants, in 1989, violated no clearly established Fourth Amendment right of which reasonable officers would have known when they searched between the mattress and box spring.  After all, a state actor is neither expected to carry a crystal ball nor \"to determine the manner in which the law's grey areas will be clarified and defined.\"  Borucki v.

The defendants, therefore, were justified in searching the Crookers' home for Tondryk and looking in places where Tondryk might have been hiding.  Although the district court so found, it nevertheless denied the defendants' claim of qualified immunity on the ground that the search between the mattress and box spring was not within the proper confines of a protective sweep because it would not be reasonable to expect a person to be hiding in those environs.  Thus, the court reasoned, the search was not permissible in the absence of a search warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that Buie speaks of a protective sweep \"narrowly confined to a cursory visual inspection of those places in which a person might be hiding.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112384\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Buie,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112384/maryland-v-buie/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span>, 110 S.Ct. at 1094.   The facts of Buie, however, did not present the issue of the permissibility of a limited search for accessible weapons (which it is not unreasonable to expect might be hidden between a mattress and box spring) conducted simultaneously with the search for a dangerous confederate of the arrestee.  Thus, we cannot say, even today, that Buie forecloses the possibility that such a scenario is lawful.  Indeed, the Second Circuit recently determined that a protective sweep can include a search for weapons within easy reach of an individual whom the officers have reasonably concluded is dangerous.
