We  conclude that the  district court\n                    \n\nproperly dismissed  plaintiff's  action for  lack of  subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction.  \n\n     Plaintiff complained of the treatment she and her mother\n\nreceived from  various private doctors and  other health care\n\nproviders.    She contended  the  providers'  conduct was  so\n\negregious as to amount to a deprivation of her constitutional\n\nrights  to  privacy,  life,   liberty,  and  the  pursuit  of\n\nhappiness.     Because the defendants are all private actors,\n\nplaintiff has failed to state any viable federal civil rights\n\nclaim under 42 U.S.C.   1983.  Mendez v.

As complete  diversity of citizenship  is\n\nlacking between  the parties, the federal  district court did\n\nnot have jurisdiction to adjudicate the state law  claims and\n\nproperly dismissed the action.
