BACKGROUND\r                                                 \r\n\n          On  January  17,  1994,  a Suffolk  County  Grand  Jury\r\n\nindicted Mains in the  Superior Court of Massachusetts (Sullivan,\r\n\nJ.), for the  crimes of Murder in the First  Degree, in violation\r\n\nof Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  265,    1, and for  unlawfully carrying  a\r\n\nfirearm, in violation of Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 269,   10.  Mains was\r\n\nconvicted on both charges and was sentenced to life  imprisonment\r\n\non the murder charge; the charge of carrying a firearm was placed\r\n\non file.  His conviction was upheld by the Supreme Judicial Court\r\n\nof Massachusetts.1  See   Commonwealth v. Mains, 374  N.E.2d 576,\r                                                         \r\n\n577 (1978).\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Petitioner  filed two motions  for a new  trial denied by  the\r\ncourt on April 22, 1977.  Mains then appealed the  conviction and\r\nthe  denial of both motions for a new trial; the Supreme Judicial\r\nCourt affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          On May 31, 1978,  Mains filed his first petition  for a\r\n\nwrit  of habeas  corpus pursuant  to 28  U.S.C.    2254, claiming\r\n\ninter  alia that  the prosecutor  failed to  disclose exculpatory\r                     \r\n\nevidence  about a  key witness,  ineffective assistance  of trial\r\n\ncounsel, and that the  trial judge's instructions to the  jury on\r\n\nthe issue of the  \"lawfulness\" of the killing violated  his right\r\n\nto  due process, by effectively  directing the jury  to find that\r\n\nsaid element  of the crime was  proven.  On August  13, 1979, the\r\n\ndistrict court  (Freedman, J.) allowed the  petition, granted the\r\n\nwrit,  and ordered  a new  trial.   However, the  Commonwealth of\r\n\nMassachusetts appealed,  and  this court  reversed  the  district\r\n\ncourt's decision  and  dismissed  the  petition.   See  Mains  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nButterworth,  619 F.2d  83, cert.  denied, 449  U.S.  864 (1980).\r                                                   \r\n\nMains then filed a motion for rehearing wherein he raised, again,\r\n\nthe  issue of  the trial  court's instructions.   The  motion was\r\n\ndenied on March  27, 1980.  The decision stated  that (the court)\r\n\n\"has given this case particularly careful and close attention and\r\n\nthere  is  nothing  in  the  petition  that  was  not  previously\r\n\nconsidered.\" \r\n\n          On  February 11, 1983, Mains  filed a motion  for a new\r\n\ntrial pro se,  before the  state court, claiming  that the  trial\r                      \r\n\ncourt's instructions to the jury relieved the Commonwealth of its\r\n\nburden  of proof  on  the  element  of  malice  in  violation  of\r\n\nSandstrom  v.  Montana, 442  U.S. 510  (1979).   This  motion was\r                                \r\n\ndenied.    Mains'  subsequent  application for  leave  to  appeal\r\n\npursuant to Mass. Gen.  L. ch. 278,   33E was  also denied by the\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nSingle Justice of  the Supreme Judicial  Court (Wilkins, J.)  who\r\n\nc   o   n   c   l   u   d   e   d               t   h   a   t   ,\r\n\n            [a]rguably,   [the  petitioner's   claim]\r\n            could   be   interpreted  as   either  an\r\n            impermissible presumption,  raising a new\r\n            issue under Sandstrom v.  Montana, supra,\r                                                              \r\n            or  a  change  in  the  burden  of proof,\r\n            raising an old issue under In re Winship,\r                                                              \r\n            supra,  and Mullaney v. Wilbur, supra . .\r                                                           \r\n            . My inclination is to say that, if there\r\n            is an error at  all, it involves an error\r\n            that could have been raised before.\r\n\n          On April  6, 1992,  Mains filed  a second petition  for\r\n\nwrit of  habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   2254, a motion for\r\n\nappointment  of  counsel,  and  a  motion  to  proceed  in  forma\r                                                                           \r\n\npauperis.2   Respondents filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds\r                  \r\n\nthat the  petition was successive and  an abuse of the  writ.  On\r\n\nMay 31, 1994, the district  court (Wolf, J.) granted respondents'\r\n\nmotion and  dismissed the petition.3  In  addition, a certificate\r\n\nof  probable  cause to  appeal was  granted  on August  15, 1994,\r\n\npursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 22(b),4  and Counsel was appointed to\r\n\nrepresent Mains on November 3, 1994.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   Petitioner  also filed  a motion  for a  show-cause order  on\r\nDecember 4, 1992.   On June  14, 1993, the district  court (Wolf,\r\nJ.) denied appointment of  counsel, granted the motion  for leave\r\nto  proceed in forma pauperis, and  ordered respondents to answer\r                                       \r\non or before July 30, 1993. \r\n\n3   With regard to  respondents' motion to  dismiss, the district\r\ncourt found, \"[i]n essence,  the petitioner has reasserted claims\r\npreviously  rejected in  connection with his  original petition[]\r\nand made a new  argument concerning the jury instructions  at his\r\ntrial which does not constitute a new claim and, in any event, is\r\nan abuse of the writ.\"\r\n\n4  See Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880 (1983); Lozada v. Deeds,\r                                                                          \r\n498 U.S. 430 (1991). \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          The sole issue on appeal is whether the district  court\r\n\nproperly  dismissed as  successive and  as an  abuse of  the writ\r\n\nMains'  claim  that  the  trial court's  instructions  on  malice\r\n\nviolated his right to due process.5    \r\n\n          Mains's  first Habeas  petition  stems from  the  trial\r\n\ncourt's   purportedly  improper  withholding  the  issue  of  the\r\n\nlawfulness of the  killing from  the jury's  consideration.   The\r\n\ntrial  judge's instruction  stated  that \"'there  is no  question\r\n\nraised  here that there was  a homicide committed',  and that the\r\n\njury  must first  determine whether  the defendant  committed the\r\n\nhomicide.\"  See Commonwealth v. Mains, 374 N.E.2d at 577-578.  In\r                                               \r\n\nhis  petition Mains  asseverates  that the  Commonwealth has  the\r\n\nburden  of proving  unlawfulness beyond  a reasonable  doubt, and\r\n\nthat there  is  sufficient evidence  which  raises the  issue  of\r\n\nlawfulness (i.e. that the  alleged victim died with a  gun in his\r                          \r\n\nhand,  that Mains testified to  having been shot,  and that Mains\r\n\nwas \"jammed in\" and \"couldn't run\").\r\n\n          In  his second  petition Mains  argues that  the malice\r\n\ninstruction was unconstitutional because it shifted the burden of\r\n\nproof  to Petitioner  and caused  the jury  to find  Mains guilty\r\n\nunless  he controverted the evidence.   In addition, Mains argues\r\n\nthat  the  unlawful  presumption  or  implied  language,  further\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5  In addition, petitioner further raised that (1)the prosecution\r\nfailed to  disclose exculpatory evidence;  (2) he was  denied the\r\neffective  assistance  of  counsel;  and (3)  the  trial  judge's\r\ninstructions  to  the jury  removed the  issue of  lawfulness, an\r\nelement of the offense,  from their consideration.  All  of these\r\nclaims were  dismissed as successive; petitioner  does not appeal\r\nthat portion of the district court's decision.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nprevented the  jury from  considering manslaughter.   The averred\r\n\ndefective instruction reads as follows:\r\n\n              \"Malice  as  used  in   the  expression\r\n            doesn't   necessarily   imply  ill   will\r\n            towards   the   person   killed.      Any\r\n            intentional  killing  of  a  human  being\r\n            without   legal  justification,   without\r\n            excuse,      with     no      extenuating\r\n            circumstances,  is malicious.  That is to\r\n            say,  it is done  with malice  within the\r\n            meaning    of   that    expression   and,\r\n            therefore,   is   murder,   and  is   not\r\n            manslaughter.\r\n\n              The   word    \"aforethought\"   in   the\r\n            expression  malice  aforethought has  its\r\n            ordinary meaning.    That means  to  say,\r\n            \"Thought of beforehand; forethought.\"  If\r\n            the killing was intentional,  even though\r\n            the act followed the  thought immediately\r\n            without   time    for   deliberation   or\r\n            reflection,  the  killing  was then  with\r\n            malice aforethought within the meaning of\r\n            that technical expression of the law, and\r\n            is therefore a murder.\r\n\n              A   killing   may   be  malicious   and\r\n            consequently  murder,   even  though  the\r\n            slayer didn't wish to cause it.  If a man\r\n            intentionally    and    without     legal\r\n            justification,  excuse   or  extenuation,\r\n            uses upon  the body  of another  person a\r\n            force, for example, a bullet from a  gun,\r\n            that is  used to do grievous  bodily harm\r\n            to  the other  person, or cause  death to\r\n            the other person, and so used will create\r\n            a  clear and  plain  likelihood that  the\r\n            other person  could  or would  die  as  a\r\n            result,  the act is then malicious within\r\n            the meaning  of the law,  even though the\r\n            doer  of the  act was  indifferent as  to\r\n            whether  or  not death  would  result, or\r\n            even if he  wished and  hoped that  death\r\n            would not result, for  it still would  be\r\n            malicious  within  the  meaning   of  the\r\n            statute  concerning  itself with  murder,\r\n            because the word \"malice\" as used in  the\r\n            law  does not  necessarily mean  or imply\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n            hatred  or ill  will  toward  the  person\r\n            killed,  but  includes  any intention  to\r\n            inflict   upon  another   serious  injury\r\n            without    justification    or    without\r\n            palliation.  *  *  *\r\n\n              \"Malice aforethought  in the expression\r\n            that  I  have  used  in  connection  with\r\n            murder  in  the  second  degree  I repeat\r\n            includes  every  unjustifiable,  unlawful\r\n            motive,  and malice  can be  implied from\r\n            any  deliberate  and  cruel  act  by  one\r\n            person towards another.\"\r\n\n          In  the instant case, even if the malice portion of the\r\n\ninstruction  is  deemed to  differ  from  the unlawfulness  issue\r\n\npreviously raised, said issue was accessible to Mains at the time\r\n\nwhen the original  petition was filed.   Rule  9(b) of the  rules\r\n\ngoverning  habeas corpus  proceedings,  28 U.S.C.  foll.    2254,\r\n\nprovides  for  dismissal  of  \"successive\"  petitions,  or  those\r\n\npetitions which raise grounds that were available, but not relied\r\n\nupon,  in a prior petition.6  Because Mains had already presented\r\n\nthe issue of whether  the trial court's instructions to  the jury\r\n\nrelieved  the   Commonwealth  of  its  burden   of  proving  each\r\n\nindividual  element of  the  murder offense  beyond a  reasonable\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6   See  Sawyer v.

The\r\nargument  in   Mains'  second   petition  is,  again,   that  the\r\nCommonwealth obtained a conviction without proving  every element\r\nof the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, but regarding the issue\r\nof malice  in the judge's instructions,  Mains includes Sandstrom\r                                                                           \r\nv.  Montana, 442 U.S. 510  (1979), arguing that  because the jury\r                     \r\nwas told that some evidence of malice was sufficient to support a\r\nconviction, the instruction relieved the Government of its burden\r\nof proof.\r\n\n8  Rule 9(b) of the rules governing habeas corpus proceedings, 28\r\nU.S.C. foll.   2254 provides, in pertinent part, that \"[a] second\r\nor successive petition may  be dismissed if the judge  finds that\r\nit fails to  allege new or  different grounds for relief  and the\r\nprior  determination was on the  merits or, if  new and different\r\ngrounds  are alleged,  the judge  finds that  the failure  of the\r\npetitioner  to   assert  those   grounds  in  a   prior  petition\r\nconstituted  an abuse of the  writ.\"  \"Grounds\",  for purposes of\r\nthis  rule, means  a  \"sufficient legal  basis  for granting  the\r\nrelief sought.\"  See  Sanders v.

Because  the district court determined that\r\nthe petitioner had not demonstrated \"cause\" sufficient to prevent\r\ndismissal on the ground of  abuse of the writ, the court  did not\r\nreach the issue  of whether the  petitioner had demonstrated  any\r\n\"prejudice\" or that \"a  fundamental miscarriage of justice\" would\r\nresult if the court did not entertain his claim. \r\n\n10    The Sandstrom  decision was  announced  in June  1979, five\r                             \r\nmonths   before  Mains   filed  his   brief  responding   to  the\r\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts' appeal  to this court in  Mains v.\r                                                                        \r\nButterworth,  supra.

BACKGROUND</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 17, 1994, a Suffolk County Grand Jury indicted Mains in the Superior Court of Massachusetts (Sullivan, J.), for the crimes of Murder in the First Degree, in violation of Mass.Gen.L. ch. 265, &#167; 1, and for unlawfully carrying a firearm, in violation of Mass.Gen.L. ch. 269, &#167; 10.   Mains was convicted on both charges and was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder charge;  the charge of carrying a firearm was placed on file.   His conviction was upheld by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See Commonwealth v. Mains, 374 Mass. 733, 374 N.E.2d 576, 577 (1978).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 31, 1978, Mains filed his first petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254, claiming inter alia that the prosecutor failed to disclose exculpatory evidence about a key witness, ineffective assistance of trial counsel, and that the trial judge's instructions to the jury on the issue of the \"lawfulness\" of the killing violated his right to due process, by effectively directing the jury to find that said element of the crime was proven.   On August 13, 1979, the district court (Freedman, J.) allowed the petition, granted the writ, and ordered a new trial.   However, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts appealed, and this court reversed the district court's decision and dismissed the petition.   See Mains v. Butterworth, 619 F.2d 83 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 864, 101 S.Ct. 171, 66 L.Ed.2d 82 (1980).   Mains then filed a motion for rehearing wherein he raised, again, the issue of the trial court's instructions.   The motion was denied on March 27, 1980.   The decision stated that (the court) \"has given this case particularly careful and close attention and there is nothing in the petition that was not previously considered.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 11, 1983, Mains filed a motion for a new trial pro se, before the state court, claiming that the trial court's instructions to the jury relieved the Commonwealth of its burden of proof on the element of malice in violation of Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979).   This motion was denied.   Mains' subsequent application for leave to appeal pursuant to Mass.Gen.L. ch. 278, &#167; 33E was also denied by the Single Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court (Wilkins, J.) who concluded that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p>[a]rguably, [the petitioner's claim] could be interpreted as either an impermissible presumption, raising a new issue under Sandstrom v.

Wilbur, supra [421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975) ] ... My inclination is to say that, if there is an error at all, it involves an error that could have been raised before.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 6, 1992, Mains filed a second petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254, a motion for appointment of counsel, and a motion to proceed in forma pauperis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Respondents filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the petition was successive and an abuse of the writ.   On May 31, 1994, the district court (Wolf, J.) granted respondents' motion and dismissed the petition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In addition, a certificate of probable cause to appeal was granted on August 15, 1994, pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 22(b),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and Counsel was appointed to represent Mains on November 3, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court properly dismissed as successive and as an abuse of the writ Mains' claim that the trial court's instructions on malice violated his right to due process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mains's first Habeas petition stems from the trial court's purportedly improper withholding the issue of the lawfulness of the killing from the jury's consideration.   The trial judge's instruction stated that \" 'there is no question raised here that there was a homicide committed', and that the jury must first determine whether the defendant committed the homicide.\"   See Commonwealth v. Mains, 374 N.E.2d at 577-578.   In his petition Mains asseverates that the Commonwealth has the burden of proving unlawfulness beyond a reasonable doubt, and that there is sufficient evidence which raises the issue of lawfulness (i.e. that the alleged victim died with a gun in his hand, that Mains testified to having been shot, and that Mains was \"jammed in\" and \"couldn't run\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his second petition Mains argues that the malice instruction was unconstitutional because it shifted the burden of proof to Petitioner and caused the jury to find Mains guilty unless he controverted the evidence.   In addition, Mains argues that the unlawful presumption or implied language, further prevented the jury from considering manslaughter.   The averred defective instruction reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Malice as used in the expression doesn't necessarily imply ill will towards the person killed.   Any intentional killing of a human being without legal justification, without excuse, with no extenuating circumstances, is malicious.   That is to say, it is done with malice within the meaning of that expression and, therefore, is murder, and is not manslaughter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word \"aforethought\" in the expression malice aforethought has its ordinary meaning.   That means to say, \"Thought of beforehand;  forethought.\"   If the killing was intentional, even though the act followed the thought immediately without time for deliberation or reflection, the killing was then with malice aforethought within the meaning of that technical expression of the law, and is therefore a murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A killing may be malicious and consequently murder, even though the slayer didn't wish to cause it.   If a man intentionally and without legal justification, excuse or extenuation, uses upon the body of another person a force, for example, a bullet from a gun, that is used to do grievous bodily harm to the other person, or cause death to the other person, and so used will create a clear and plain likelihood that the other person could or would die as a result, the act is then malicious within the meaning of the law, even though the doer of the act was indifferent as to whether or not death would result, or even if he wished and hoped that death would not result, for it still would be malicious within the meaning of the statute concerning itself with murder, because the word \"malice\" as used in the law does not necessarily mean or imply hatred or ill will toward the person killed, but includes any intention to inflict upon another serious injury without justification or without palliation. * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Malice aforethought in the expression that I have used in connection with murder in the second degree I repeat includes every unjustifiable, unlawful motive, and malice can be implied from any deliberate and cruel act by one person towards another.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, even if the malice portion of the instruction is deemed to differ from the unlawfulness issue previously raised, said issue was accessible to Mains at the time when the original petition was filed.   Rule 9(b) of the rules governing habeas corpus proceedings, 28 U.S.C. foll. &#167; 2254, provides for dismissal of \"successive\" petitions, or those petitions which raise grounds that were available, but not relied upon, in a prior petition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Because Mains had already presented the issue of whether the trial court's instructions to the jury relieved the Commonwealth of its burden of proving each individual element of the murder offense beyond a reasonable doubt,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> respondents argue that the district court adequately concluded that Mains' claim was precluded by Rule 9(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, respondents assert that the burden of proof argument raised by the malice instruction, as the argument presented by Mains relating to the instruction on \"lawfulness,\" was available to Mains when he filed his original petition.   Respondents further allege that Mains strives to avert the effects of Rule 9(b)'s prohibition of successive petitions by stating that said claim was unavailable to him prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Sandstrom, as \"cause\" for failure to present his claims in the original petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondents allege that to the extent that Mains failed to show \"cause\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> for his failure to present the claim in the original petition, and because the Sandstrom case was decided five months before the Commonwealth of Massachusetts appealed to this court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> the district court properly dismissed the petition as successive and as an abuse of the writ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his second petition, Mains avers that habeas relief is warranted because his claim under Sandstrom is a \"new rule\" which meets the second exception presented in Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989).   Respondents counter by stating that the Sandstrom holding advanced those principles enumerated in In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), and Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975), to presumptions created in jury instructions.   Respondents correctly allege that Sandstrom was a \"lineal descendant of Winship;  it simply held that an instruction which creates a presumption of fact violates due process if it relieves the State of its burden of proving all of the elements of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\"   See Gilmore v. Taylor, 508 U.S. 333, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2112, 2118, 124 L.Ed.2d 306 (1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Respondents conclude that because Mains had already argued that the judge's instruction on lawfulness shifted the burden of proof and relieved the Commonwealth of its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> each element of the offense, the addition of Sandstrom<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> does not constitute a \"new claim\" for purposes of Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mains has failed to show cause or prejudice to oppose respondents' abuse of the writ defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  The court is not persuaded that in the instant case Sandstrom constitutes a new development in the law, or an external factor<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> affording Mains sufficient cause for his failure to present the claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  Indeed, Mains could have reasonably employed Sandstrom during the appeal and subsequent motion for rehearing that followed his original petition.   Furthermore, Mains already made an argument in his first petition regarding the instruction, and invoked In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970) and Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975), the precedents upon which Sandstrom is premised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this regard we find that petitioner's argument regarding the malice instruction and burden shifting presumption is not advanced and fails to constitute \"new ground\" for purposes of Rule 9(b).   Furthermore, because the Sandstrom claim was reasonably available to Mains at the time of his appeal of the denial of his first &#167; 2254 petition, the same does not constitute a \"new rule\" qualifying it under the second Teague exception.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.   Mains has failed to establish sufficient \"cause\" or \"prejudice\" necessary to reach the issue presented in this successive petition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  Consequently, Mains' habeas petition remains a casualty of its own procedural deficiency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

The argument in Mains' second petition is, again, that the Commonwealth obtained a conviction without proving every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, but regarding the issue of malice in the judge's instructions, Mains includes Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979), arguing that because the jury was told that some evidence of malice was sufficient to support a conviction, the instruction relieved the Government of its burden of proof</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Rule 9(b) of the rules governing habeas corpus proceedings, 28 U.S.C. foll. &#167; 2254 provides, in pertinent part, that \"[a] second or successive petition may be dismissed if the judge finds that it fails to allege new or different grounds for relief and the prior determination was on the merits or, if new and different grounds are alleged, the judge finds that the failure of the petitioner to assert those grounds in a prior petition constituted an abuse of the writ.\"  \"Grounds\", for purposes of this rule, means a \"sufficient legal basis for granting the relief sought.\"   See Sanders v.

In order to avoid the preclusive effect of Rule 9(b), a habeas petitioner must present a \"new or different claim;  a new or different argument (legal or factual) in support of a claim that has already been raised and decided on the merits is not sufficient to prevent dismissal of the claim.\"   See Collins, id. at 1505 (emphasis in original)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The abuse of the writ defense was raised by respondents in their motion to dismiss of August 5, 1993.

United States, 967 F.2d 715, 718 (1st Cir.1992).   On August 9, 1993, petitioner filed his opposition to respondents' motion.   Because the district court determined that the petitioner had not demonstrated \"cause\" sufficient to prevent dismissal on the ground of abuse of the writ, the court did not reach the issue of whether the petitioner had demonstrated any \"prejudice\" or that \"a fundamental miscarriage of justice\" would result if the court did not entertain his claim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The Sandstrom decision was announced in June 1979, five months before Mains filed his brief responding to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' appeal to this court in Mains v.

BACKGROUND</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 17, 1994, a Suffolk County Grand Jury indicted Mains in the Superior Court of Massachusetts (Sullivan, J.), for the crimes of Murder in the First Degree, in violation of Mass.Gen.L. ch. 265, &#167; 1, and for unlawfully carrying a firearm, in violation of Mass.Gen.L. ch. 269, &#167; 10.   Mains was convicted on both charges and was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder charge;  the charge of carrying a firearm was placed on file.   His conviction was upheld by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See Commonwealth v.

On August 13, 1979, the district court (Freedman, J.) allowed the petition, granted the writ, and ordered a new trial.   However, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts appealed, and this court reversed the district court's decision and dismissed the petition.   See Mains v. Butterworth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"376975\"><a href=\"/opinion/376975/robert-mains-v-fred-butterworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">619</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The decision stated that (the court) \"has given this case particularly careful and close attention and there is nothing in the petition that was not previously considered.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 11, 1983, Mains filed a motion for a new trial pro se, before the state court, claiming that the trial court's instructions to the jury relieved the Commonwealth of its burden of proof on the element of malice in violation of Sandstrom v.

On May 31, 1994, the district court (Wolf, J.) granted respondents' motion and dismissed the petition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In addition, a certificate of probable cause to appeal was granted on August 15, 1994, pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 22(b),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and Counsel was appointed to represent Mains on November 3, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court properly dismissed as successive and as an abuse of the writ Mains' claim that the trial court's instructions on malice violated his right to due process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mains's first Habeas petition stems from the trial court's purportedly improper withholding the issue of the lawfulness of the killing from the jury's consideration.   The trial judge's instruction stated that \" 'there is no question raised here that there was a homicide committed', and that the jury must first determine whether the defendant committed the homicide.\"   See Commonwealth v. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2081565\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Mains,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2081565/commonwealth-v-mains/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">577-578</span></a></span>.   In his petition Mains asseverates that the Commonwealth has the burden of proving unlawfulness beyond a reasonable doubt, and that there is sufficient evidence which raises the issue of lawfulness (i.e. that the alleged victim died with a gun in his hand, that Mains testified to having been shot, and that Mains was \"jammed in\" and \"couldn't run\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his second petition Mains argues that the malice instruction was unconstitutional because it shifted the burden of proof to Petitioner and caused the jury to find Mains guilty unless he controverted the evidence.   In addition, Mains argues that the unlawful presumption or implied language, further prevented the jury from considering manslaughter.   The averred defective instruction reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Malice as used in the expression doesn't necessarily imply ill will towards the person killed.   Any intentional killing of a human being without legal justification, without excuse, with no extenuating circumstances, is malicious.   That is to say, it is done with malice within the meaning of that expression and, therefore, is murder, and is not manslaughter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word \"aforethought\" in the expression malice aforethought has its ordinary meaning.   That means to say, \"Thought of beforehand;  forethought.\"   If the killing was intentional, even though the act followed the thought immediately without time for deliberation or reflection, the killing was then with malice aforethought within the meaning of that technical expression of the law, and is therefore a murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A killing may be malicious and consequently murder, even though the slayer didn't wish to cause it.   If a man intentionally and without legal justification, excuse or extenuation, uses upon the body of another person a force, for example, a bullet from a gun, that is used to do grievous bodily harm to the other person, or cause death to the other person, and so used will create a clear and plain likelihood that the other person could or would die as a result, the act is then malicious within the meaning of the law, even though the doer of the act was indifferent as to whether or not death would result, or even if he wished and hoped that death would not result, for it still would be malicious within the meaning of the statute concerning itself with murder, because the word \"malice\" as used in the law does not necessarily mean or imply hatred or ill will toward the person killed, but includes any intention to inflict upon another serious injury without justification or without palliation. * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Malice aforethought in the expression that I have used in connection with murder in the second degree I repeat includes every unjustifiable, unlawful motive, and malice can be implied from any deliberate and cruel act by one person towards another.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, even if the malice portion of the instruction is deemed to differ from the unlawfulness issue previously raised, said issue was accessible to Mains at the time when the original petition was filed.   Rule 9(b) of the rules governing habeas corpus proceedings, 28 U.S.C. foll. &#167; 2254, provides for dismissal of \"successive\" petitions, or those petitions which raise grounds that were available, but not relied upon, in a prior petition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Because Mains had already presented the issue of whether the trial court's instructions to the jury relieved the Commonwealth of its burden of proving each individual element of the murder offense beyond a reasonable doubt,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> respondents argue that the district court adequately concluded that Mains' claim was precluded by Rule 9(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, respondents assert that the burden of proof argument raised by the malice instruction, as the argument presented by Mains relating to the instruction on \"lawfulness,\" was available to Mains when he filed his original petition.   Respondents further allege that Mains strives to avert the effects of Rule 9(b)'s prohibition of successive petitions by stating that said claim was unavailable to him prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Sandstrom, as \"cause\" for failure to present his claims in the original petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondents allege that to the extent that Mains failed to show \"cause\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> for his failure to present the claim in the original petition, and because the Sandstrom case was decided five months before the Commonwealth of Massachusetts appealed to this court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> the district court properly dismissed the petition as successive and as an abuse of the writ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his second petition, Mains avers that habeas relief is warranted because his claim under Sandstrom is a \"new rule\" which meets the second exception presented in Teague v. Lane, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112206\"><a href=\"/opinion/112206/teague-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112206\"><a href=\"/opinion/112206/teague-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
