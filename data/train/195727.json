Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                                \n\n                                         \n\n                            Before\n\n            Selya, Cyr and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r                                                             \n\n                                         \n\nJose L. Rodriguez, pro se.\r                             \nScott  Harshbarger, Attorney  General,  and  William J.  Duensing,\r                                                                             \nAssistant Attorney General, for respondent.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.  After  a searching and extensive  review of\r                           \n\nthe   issues  presented,  we   affirm  the  district  court's\n\ndismissal  of Jose  Rodriguez's  petition for  habeas corpus.\n\nThe district court concluded that the pendency of a new trial\n\nmotion before  the state trial court  barred consideration of\n\npetitioner's  federal habeas  corpus  claims.   We granted  a\n\ncertificate of probable cause in light of the state's lengthy\n\ndelay in  resolving either  petitioner's new trial  motion or\n\nhis  appeal and our difficulty  in discerning its  cause.  We\n\nsought  from  the  government  a  memorandum  addressing  the\n\nreasons--and justifications--for the delay.   Having reviewed\n\nall  the submissions carefully, we find that the delay in the\n\nstate court proceedings does  not excuse petitioner's failure\n\nto exhaust  his state remedies before  seeking federal habeas\n\ncorpus relief.  See 28 U.S.C.   2254(b).\r                               \n\n     There is  no dispute  that petitioner has  not exhausted\n\nhis  state remedies;  petitioner claims  that his  failure to\n\nexhaust is  excused because  of the  excessive  delay by  the\n\nstate in acting upon  either his appeal or new  trial motion.\n\nSee,  e.g., Hankins v. Fulcomer,  941 F.2d 246,  250 (3d Cir.\r                                           \n\n1991).   Petitioner's appeal  has been  pending for  over six\n\nyears, while his new  trial motion has been pending  for over\n\nfour years.  What was less clear at the outset but more clear\n\nnow is  that this delay is of petitioner's own making.  After\n\npetitioner filed his appeal, a not uncommon problem developed\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nin  obtaining the  transcription of  the trial  court record.\n\nThe situation was exacerbated by the fact that petitioner did\n\nnot have counsel to aid him  in rectifying the problem, as he\n\nhad  fired his lawyer following sentencing and had not as yet\n\nrequested replacement  counsel.   The  transcription  problem\n\nlooked  as if it was about to resolve itself when petitioner,\n\nacting pro se, filed a new trial motion with the trial  court\r                         \n\nin May 1990. \n\n     The  effect of  this filing  was to create  a procedural\n\nlogjam--the  lower court  record could  not be  assembled for\n\ntransmission to the appellate  court until the disposition of\n\nthe pending motion,  but the  new trial motion  would not  be\n\nresolved until the appeal  was either withdrawn or concluded.\n\nSee Mass. R.  Crim. Proc. 30(b) (reporters'  notes); Mass. R.\r               \n\nApp.  Proc. 4(c),  9(a),  9(d).   By  seeking to  pursue  two\n\ncourses of action simultaneously, petitioner prevented either\n\ncourse  from proceeding.  And since it has been and continues\n\nto be within petitioner's power to cure this situation, i.e.,\r                                                                        \n\nby  withdrawing his new trial motion or his appeal, the delay\n\nin  the  resolution  of  the pending  matters  cannot  excuse\n\npetitioner's  failure to  exhaust  his state  remedies.   See\r                                                                         \n\nDeters v. Collins, 985  F.2d 789, 796 (5th Cir.  1993) (delay\r                             \n\ndoes   not  excuse  failure   to  exhaust   where  petitioner\n\ncontributes to delay).\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n",
