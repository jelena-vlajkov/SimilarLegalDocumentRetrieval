On  May  2,  1994, appellant  Christopher\r                            \r\n\nOnyejekwe pled  guilty to  one  count of  credit card  fraud.\r\n\nSentence  was imposed on July 8, 1994.  This appeal followed.\r\n\nAppellant seeks to vacate his guilty plea and sentence on the\r\n\nground of ineffective assistance of counsel.  He also alleges\r\n\nvarious sentencing  errors.  In particular,  he contends that\r\n\nthe district court erred  (1) in applying the obstruction-of-\r\n\njustice enhancement based on a finding that he lied about his\r\n\nresidence at  the suppression  hearing; (2) in  assessing him\r\n\ntwo  criminal  history points  based  on  a finding  that  he\r\n\ncommitted the instant offense (i.e., relevant  conduct) while\r\n\nserving a state sentence of probation; and (3) in determining\r\n\nthe amount  of restitution.   For the  following reasons,  we\r\n\naffirm.\r\n\n                          BACKGROUND\r\n\n     Because  appellant's conviction  resulted from  a guilty\r\n\nplea,  we derive  the  pertinent facts  from the  uncontested\r\n\nportion of  the  Presentence Investigation  Report (PSR),  as\r\n\nwell  as the remainder of the  record.1  See United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  This  record  includes transcripts  of  the arraignments,\r\nevidentiary   hearing  on   the  motion   to  suppress,   and\r\ndisposition  hearing.    We  note  that  appellant's appendix\r\nincludes many documents  which were not filed in the district\r\ncourt--including  transcripts of  testimony before  the grand\r\njury--and are, thus, outside the record.  See Fed. R. App. P.\r                                                         \r\r\n\nTejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d 105, 107 (1st  Cir. 1995). On October\r                          \r\n\n15,  1993, appellant and  his co-defendant, Elizabeth Mogaji,\r\n\nwere secretly indicted with five  counts of fraudulent use of\r\n\naccess  devices.2  18 U.S.C.    1029(a)(2), 2.  Appellant was\r\n\narrested on  October 20, 1993.  At the time of his arrest, he\r\n\nwas  carrying \"a  list  of names,  dates  of birth,  mothers'\r\n\nmaiden names,  etc.\"   An arraignment  and bail hearing  were\r\n\nheld  on  October 21,  1993.    Appellant informed  pre-trial\r\n\nservices  and the  magistrate that  he lived at  202 Bellevue\r\n\nAvenue, Providence.  The government proffered that  appellant\r\n\nactually resided at 10 Stamford Avenue, Providence.\r\n\n     On October 22, 1993, Mogaji  was arrested at 10 Stamford\r\n\nAvenue,  where  she  was  living  under  the  name  of Althea\r\n\nMedeiros.   On October  25, 1993,  federal agents  executed a\r\n\nsearch warrant at 10 Stamford Avenue.  Among the items seized\r\n\nwere credit cards in the names of Althea Medeiros and John P.\r\n\nMedeiros and documents in the names of  Onyejekwe and Mogaji.\r\n\nOn  October 29, 1993, a federal agent seized two plastic bags\r\n\nfrom  the  cellar  of  the  Stamford property.    These  bags\r\n\ncontained incriminating documents, including GM  credit cards\r\n\nin  the names  of  Althea and  Leonard Medeiros;  counterfeit\r\n\ndrivers' licenses in various false names with a photograph of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10(a).  These latter documents, of  course, cannot inform our\r\ndecision. \r\n\n2.  Elizabeth Mogaji is appellant's girlfriend.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nappellant  or Mogaji;  a list  of names  and other  data; and\r\n\nblank credit card applications.\r\n\n     On  November  3,  1993,  a  superseding  indictment  was\r\n\nreturned  which added  a conspiracy count  (Count 1),  see 18\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.C.   371, to the five counts of credit card fraud (Counts\r\n\n2-6).   Several  months  later, appellant  filed a  motion to\r\n\nsuppress  the evidence  seized  at the  Stamford property  on\r\n\nOctober 29, 1993.   An evidentiary hearing was held  on April\r\n\n8,  1994.  At this hearing, appellant testified that he lived\r\n\nat 10 Stamford Avenue, and that he had placed the two plastic\r\n\nbags of documents  in his own laundry dryer in  the cellar at\r\n\nthat address.  He  admitted that he told the  magistrate that\r\n\nhe  lived at 202 Bellevue  Avenue, but testified  that he had\r\n\ntwo  residences.   The district  court denied  the motion  to\r\n\nsuppress  on the ground that appellant  lacked standing.  The\r\n\ncourt stated in pertinent part:\r\n\n          It further  seems to me  that insofar  as\r\n          Mr. Onyejekwe is concerned we're going to\r\n          hold him to  what he told  the Magistrate\r\n          Judge.  That  he lived  at 202  Bellevue.\r\n          That was his home.  So that he would have\r\n          no  expectation of  privacy in  number 10\r\n          Stanford Street [sic] in any event.\r\n\n     Appellant  pled guilty  to  Count 3  of the  superseding\r\n\nindictment  on  May  2,  1994.    The  remaining  counts were\r\n\ndismissed.  Prior to sentencing, a PSR was prepared.  The PSR\r\n\nidentified appellant's legal address as 202 Bellevue  Avenue.\r\n\nAppellant objected on  the ground that the PSR should reflect\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nthat he maintained  a second address  at 10 Stamford  Avenue.\r\n\nThe probation officer responded that during the course of his\r\n\npresentence  interview,  appellant  advised  that  his  legal\r\n\naddress  was 202 Bellevue Avenue, that Mogaji had moved to 10\r\n\nStamford Avenue, and that  appellant would periodically  stay\r\n\nwith  her but maintained his legal  residence as 202 Bellevue\r\n\nAvenue.\r\n\n     A sentencing hearing was held on July 8, 1994.  Based on\r\n\na total offense level  of 15 and a criminal  history category\r\n\nof III,  the court determined the  guideline sentencing range\r\n\nto be 24-30  months.   Appellant was sentenced  to 28  months\r\n\nimprisonment, followed by a period of supervised release.  He\r\n\nwas also  ordered to pay restitution to  Chase Manhattan Bank\r\n\nin the amount of $7,036.17.     \r\n\n                          DISCUSSION\r\n\nI.   INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\r\n\n     Appellant,  who  was  represented  by  three  successive\r\n\ncourt-appointed  attorneys, argues that each of his attorneys\r\n\nwas  inept and  that  their  combined  deficient  performance\r\n\nrendered  his guilty plea involuntary.  He also contends that\r\n\nhis third attorney's assistance at the sentencing hearing was\r\n\nincompetent.    Ordinarily,  we  do not  address  ineffective\r\n\nassistance of counsel arguments on  direct appeal.  This case\r\n\nis no  exception.  Appellant  alleges, inter  alia, that  his\r                                                              \r\n\nattorneys failed  to investigate his case,  were ignorant and\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nill-prepared, and provided  him with misleading  information.\r\n\nThese charges depend upon  evidentiary matters which are best\r\n\nconsidered by the district court in the first instance.  See,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g.,  United States  v. McGill,  952 F.2d  16, 19  (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1991)  (fact-specific claims  of ineffective  assistance must\r\n\noriginally be presented to the district court).  Accordingly,\r\n\nappellant's claim  of ineffective assistance is  not properly\r\n\nbefore us.\r\n\nII.  SENTENCING\r\n\n     A. Obstruction of Justice \r\n\n     U.S.S.G.   3C1.1 directs  the district court to increase\r\n\na defendant's offense  level by two levels  \"if the defendant\r\n\nwillfully obstructed or impeded,  or attempted to obstruct or\r\n\nimpede,   the   administration   of   justice    during   the\r\n\ninvestigation,  prosecution,  or  sentencing of  the  instant\r\n\noffense.\"  The enhancement  applies where a defendant commits\r\n\nperjury.  See U.S.S.G.    3C1.1, comment. (n.3(b)); see  also\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited  States v.  Dunnigan,  113 S.  Ct.  1111, 1116  (1993)\r                                       \r\n\n(defining perjury).  In the instant  case, the district court\r\n\nfound  that appellant  perjured  himself  at the  suppression\r\n\nhearing.   Accordingly,  the court  made a  two level  upward\r\n\nadjustment to appellant's offense level.  \r\n\n     Appellant contends  that  the district  court failed  to\r\n\nidentify which  portions of his  testimony it believed  to be\r\n\nfalse.   This contention  is misplaced.   The district  court\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nspecifically found  that appellant was not  telling the truth\r\n\nwhen he testified that he lived at 10 Stamford Avenue, a fact\r\n\nmaterial to the issue of his  standing to bring the motion to\r\n\nsuppress.   The  district  court  was  not required  to  make\r\n\nfurther subsidiary  findings or to explain  its evaluation of\r\n\nappellant's  testimony.  See United States  v. Tracy, 36 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n199, 203 (1st  Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 609 (1994).\r                                              \r\n\n     Appellant   also  argues  that   there  is  insufficient\r\n\nevidence  to support  the court's  finding that  he testified\r\n\nfalsely.    We  disagree.    Although  the  location  of  his\r\n\nresidence  was an  issue from  the very  beginning, appellant\r\n\nconsistently maintained that he  lived at 202 Bellevue Avenue\r\n\nuntil the  suppression hearing where, for the  first time, he\r\n\nstated  to the  district court  that he  maintained a  second\r\n\nresidence at 10 Stamford  Avenue.  The court was  entitled to\r\n\ngreet this conveniently-timed  announcement with  skepticism.\r\n\nMoreover, the record discloses that appellant professes to be\r\n\nindigent.  Under the circumstances, his testimony that he has\r\n\ntwo  residences is  implausible,  at  least  without  further\r\n\nexplanation.\r\n\n     We are, of course, mindful that, at the arraignment, the\r\n\ngovernment proffered that  appellant resided  at 10  Stamford\r\n\nAvenue.   The government  stated that federal  agents \"staked\r\n\nout\" that  address and arrested  appellant when  he left  the\r\n\nhouse.   In addition,  documents belonging to  appellant were\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nseized  from 10  Stamford  Avenue.   However, appellant  told\r\n\nprobation that  he would periodically stay  with Mogaji after\r\n\nshe moved to 10 Stamford Avenue.  This may explain why he was\r\n\nobserved  departing 10  Stamford Avenue and  why some  of his\r\n\npersonal  papers  were found  there,  but  the evidence  also\r\n\nsuggests  that it was Mogaji, not appellant, who lived at the\r\n\nStamford address.  Given the conflicting inferences which may\r\n\nbe drawn from  the evidence,  and with due  deference to  the\r\n\nsentencing  court's superior  opportunity  to assess  witness\r\n\ncredibility, we  cannot say  that the district  court clearly\r\n\nerred  in  finding that  appellant  lied  at the  suppression\r\n\nhearing.3   United  States v.  Brum, 948  F.2d 817,  819 (1st\r                                               \r\n\nCir.  1991) (finding  of perjury  reviewed for  clear error);\r\n\nUnited  States v. Martinez, 922 F.2d 914, 925 (1st Cir. 1991)\r                                      \r\n\n(where  there  is  more  than  one  plausible  view   of  the\r\n\ncircumstances,  a sentencing court's choice among supportable\r\n\nalternatives cannot be clearly erroneous).\r\n\n     B. Criminal History \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  We  also reject appellant's  contention that the district\r\ncourt  erred in failing to evaluate his testimony \"in a light\r\nmost favorable to the defendant[,]\" as required by U.S.S.G.  \r\n3C1.1, commentary n.1.  We  have repeatedly stated that  this\r\n\"commentary\" merely requires the district court to resolve in\r\nthe  defendant's  favor  \"`those  conflicts about  which  the\r\njudge, after weighing the evidence, has no firm conviction.'\"\r\nTracy, 36 F.3d at 204 (quoting United States v. Rojo-Alvarez,\r                                                                        \r\n944 F.2d 959, 969 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting  other circuits)).\r\nIn this case, the  district court did have a  firm conviction\r\nthat perjury had been committed.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n     Appellant's criminal history includes a January 21, 1993\r\n\nstate  conviction for embezzlement and an April 2, 1993 state\r\n\nconviction for credit  card fraud.  In  both cases, appellant\r\n\nwas sentenced to  probation.  Acting  pursuant to U.S.S.G.   \r\n\n4A1.1(c),  the  district  court  assessed  him  two  criminal\r\n\nhistory points  for these prior  sentences.   The court  then\r\n\nadded two additional criminal history points under   4A1.1(d)\r\n\non the  ground that appellant committed  the relevant conduct\r\n\nwhile serving a sentence of probation.4\r\n\n     Appellant  argues  that  the  district  court  erred  in\r\n\nassessing him the two additional points under   4A1.1(d).  In\r\n\nparticular,  he   contends  that   he  should  not   be  held\r\n\naccountable  for the  conduct  involved in  Count 6,  namely,\r\n\neighteen  cash   withdrawals  made  by  Mogaji   using  a  GM\r\n\nMastercard  between  October  26,  1992 and  June  13,  1993.\r\n\nAppellant claims that he was under immigration detention when\r\n\nthese withdrawals  were made  and was facing  prosecution for\r\n\nuse of the  same credit  card.  Under  the circumstances,  he\r\n\nargues, Mogaji's  conduct was  not foreseeable, and,  so, not\r\n\nrelevant  conduct  within the  meaning  of  U.S.S.G.    1B.3.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  The  commentary to  U.S.S.G.    4A1.1 states  that \"[t]wo\r\npoints are added if  the defendant committed any part  of the\r\ninstant offense (i.e., any  relevant conduct) while under any\r                                 \r\ncriminal  justice sentence.\"    U.S.S.G.     4A1.1,  comment.\r\n(n.4).

Indeed,\r\n\nappellant's possession of the list of names and other data on\r\n\nOctober  20,  1993 was  an overt  act  in furtherance  of the\r\n\nconspiracy.

Appellant\r\n\ncontends that the amount owed to the bank should be offset by\r\n\nthe  value of  certain goods  which they  did not  succeed in\r\n\ncarrying away  from Lechmere.   We decline to  entertain this\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.

P.  32(c)(3)(D) (current version  at\r\nRule  32(c)(1)).   The  PSR assessed  appellant two  criminal\r\nhistory  points under   4A1.1(d).   In his  objections to the\r\nPSR  and at sentencing, defense  counsel argued that this was\r\nerror because  the specific  offense to which  Onyejekwe pled\r\nguilty  (Count 3)  occurred  before Onyejekwe  was placed  on\r\nprobation.  This objection to the PSR's legal conclusion  did\r\nnot dispute a factual assertion.  We add that in the addendum\r\nto the PSR, the probation officer clarified that the criminal\r\nhistory  points  under     4A1.1(d) were  based  on  relevant\r\nconduct.

Appellant  also  argues that  Chase  Manhattan  Bank will\r\nreceive a windfall since  he and Mogaji were each  ordered to\r\npay  $7,036.17  in  restitution.   We  think  it  plain  that\r\nappellant will receive credit  for restitution paid by Mogaji\r\ntowards the loss involved in Count 3, and vice versa.\r\n\n7.  We  also  deny  appellant's  request that  we  order  the\r\ndistrict  court  to  produce   the  audio  recording  of  the\r\nsuppression  hearing.   Appellant  contends  that  the  court\r\nreporter prepared  two transcripts  of his testimony  at that\r\nhearing,  that the transcripts differ,  and that it cannot be\r\ndetermined  which of  the two  is accurate  without comparing\r\nthem  to  the audio  recording.   He  also suggests  that the\r\ndistrict court may have relied on an inaccurate transcript of\r\nhis testimony  when it  determined that he  perjured himself.\r\nAppellant  has   not  followed   the  proper  procedure   for\r\nclarifying the  record.  See Fed.  R. App. P. 10(e).   In any\r                                        \r\nevent, we see nothing to be gained by remanding the matter to\r\nthe  district  court.

Sentence was imposed on July 8, 1994.  This appeal followed.  Appellant seeks to vacate his guilty plea and sentence on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel.  He also alleges various sentencing errors.  In particular, he contends that the district court erred (1) in applying the obstruction-of-justice enhancement based on a finding that he lied about his residence at the suppression hearing;  (2) in assessing him two criminal history points based on a finding that he committed the instant offense (i.e., relevant conduct) while serving a state sentence of probation;  and (3) in determining the amount of restitution.  For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because appellant's conviction resulted from a guilty plea, we derive the pertinent facts from the uncontested portion of the Presentence Investigation Report (PSR), as well as the remainder of the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See United States v. Tejada- Beltran, 50 F.3d 105, 107 (1st Cir. 1995).  On October 15, 1993, appellant and his co-defendant, Elizabeth Mogaji, were secretly indicted with five counts of fraudulent use of access devices.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  18 U.S.C. Secs. 1029(a)(2), 2.  Appellant was arrested on October 20, 1993.  At the time of his arrest, he was carrying \"a list of names, dates of birth, mothers' maiden names, etc.\"  An arraignment and bail hearing were held on October 21, 1993.  Appellant informed pre-trial services and the magistrate that he lived at 202 Bellevue Avenue, Providence.  The government proffered that appellant actually resided at 10 Stamford Avenue, Providence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 22, 1993, Mogaji was arrested at 10 Stamford Avenue, where she was living under the name of Althea Medeiros.  On October 25, 1993, federal agents executed a search warrant at 10 Stamford Avenue.  Among the items seized were credit cards in the names of Althea Medeiros and John P. Medeiros and documents in the names of Onyejekwe and Mogaji.  On October 29, 1993, a federal agent seized two plastic bags from the cellar of the Stamford property.  These bags contained incriminating documents, including GM credit cards in the names of Althea and Leonard Medeiros;  counterfeit drivers' licenses in various false names with a photograph of appellant or Mogaji;  a list of names and other data;  and blank credit card applications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 3, 1993, a superseding indictment was returned which added a conspiracy count (Count 1), see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371, to the five counts of credit card fraud (Counts 2-6).  Several months later, appellant filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized at the Stamford property on October 29, 1993.  An evidentiary hearing was held on April 8, 1994.  At this hearing, appellant testified that he lived at 10 Stamford Avenue, and that he had placed the two plastic bags of documents in his own laundry dryer in the cellar at that address.  He admitted that he told the magistrate that he lived at 202 Bellevue Avenue, but testified that he had two residences.  The district court denied the motion to suppress on the ground that appellant lacked standing.  The court stated in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>It further seems to me that insofar as Mr. Onyejekwe is concerned we're going to hold him to what he told the Magistrate Judge.  That he lived at 202 Bellevue.  That was his home.  So that he would have no expectation of privacy in number 10 Stanford Street [sic] in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant pled guilty to Count 3 of the superseding indictment on May 2, 1994.  The remaining counts were dismissed.  Prior to sentencing, a PSR was prepared.  The PSR identified appellant's legal address as 202 Bellevue Avenue.  Appellant objected on the ground that the PSR should reflect that he maintained a second address at 10 Stamford Avenue.  The probation officer responded that during the course of his presentence interview, appellant advised that his legal address was 202 Bellevue Avenue, that Mogaji had moved to 10 Stamford Avenue, and that appellant would periodically stay with her but maintained his legal residence as 202 Bellevue Avenue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A sentencing hearing was held on July 8, 1994.  Based on a total offense level of 15 and a criminal history category of III, the court determined the guideline sentencing range to be 24-30 months.  Appellant was sentenced to 28 months imprisonment, followed by a period of supervised release.  He was also ordered to pay restitution to Chase Manhattan Bank in the amount of $7,036.17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>I. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant, who was represented by three successive court- appointed attorneys, argues that each of his attorneys was inept and that their combined deficient performance rendered his guilty plea involuntary.  He also contends that his third attorney's assistance at the sentencing hearing was incompetent.  Ordinarily, we do not address ineffective assistance of counsel arguments on direct appeal.  This case is no exception.  Appellant alleges, inter alia, that his attorneys failed to investigate his case, were ignorant and ill-prepared, and provided him with misleading information.  These charges depend upon evidentiary matters which are best considered by the district court in the first instance.  See, e.g., United States v. McGill, 952 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 1991) (fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance must originally be presented to the district court).  Accordingly, appellant's claim of ineffective assistance is not properly before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. SENTENCING</p>\n    <p>A. Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1 directs the district court to increase a defendant's offense level by two levels \"if the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense.\"  The enhancement applies where a defendant commits perjury.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1, comment.  (n.3(b));  see also United States v. Dunnigan, 113 S. Ct. 1111, 1116 (1993) (defining perjury).  In the instant case, the district court found that appellant perjured himself at the suppression hearing.  Accordingly, the court made a two level upward adjustment to appellant's offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that the district court failed to identify which portions of his testimony it believed to be false.  This contention is misplaced.  The district court specifically found that appellant was not telling the truth when he testified that he lived at 10 Stamford Avenue, a fact material to the issue of his standing to bring the motion to suppress.  The district court was not required to make further subsidiary findings or to explain its evaluation of appellant's testimony.  See United States v. Tracy, 36 F.3d 199, 203 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 609 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also argues that there is insufficient evidence to support the court's finding that he testified falsely.  We disagree.  Although the location of his residence was an issue from the very beginning, appellant consistently maintained that he lived at 202 Bellevue Avenue until the suppression hearing where, for the first time, he stated to the district court that he maintained a second residence at 10 Stamford Avenue.  The court was entitled to greet this conveniently-timed announcement with skepticism.  Moreover, the record discloses that appellant professes to be indigent.  Under the circumstances, his testimony that he has two residences is implausible, at least without further explanation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are, of course, mindful that, at the arraignment, the government proffered that appellant resided at 10 Stamford Avenue.  The government stated that federal agents \"staked out\" that address and arrested appellant when he left the house.  In addition, documents belonging to appellant were seized from 10 Stamford Avenue.  However, appellant told probation that he would periodically stay with Mogaji after she moved to 10 Stamford Avenue.  This may explain why he was observed departing 10 Stamford Avenue and why some of his personal papers were found there, but the evidence also suggests that it was Mogaji, not appellant, who lived at the Stamford address.  Given the conflicting inferences which may be drawn from the evidence, and with due deference to the sentencing court's superior opportunity to assess witness credibility, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in finding that appellant lied at the suppression hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  United States v. Brum, 948 F.2d 817, 819 (1st Cir. 1991) (finding of perjury reviewed for clear error);  United States v. Martinez, 922 F.2d 914, 925 (1st Cir. 1991) (where there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances, a sentencing court's choice among supportable alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Criminal History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's criminal history includes a January 21, 1993 state conviction for embezzlement and an April 2, 1993 state conviction for credit card fraud.  In both cases, appellant was sentenced to probation.  Acting pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.1(c), the district court assessed him two criminal history points for these prior sentences.  The court then added two additional criminal history points under Sec. 4A1.1(d) on the ground that appellant committed the relevant conduct while serving a sentence of probation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the district court erred in assessing him the two additional points under Sec. 4A1.1(d).  In particular, he contends that he should not be held accountable for the conduct involved in Count 6, namely, eighteen cash withdrawals made by Mogaji using a GM Mastercard between October 26, 1992 and June 13, 1993.  Appellant claims that he was under immigration detention when these withdrawals were made and was facing prosecution for use of the same credit card.  Under the circumstances, he argues, Mogaji's conduct was not foreseeable, and, so, not relevant conduct within the meaning of U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B.3.  Accordingly, he further argues, the district court should not have considered this conduct in calculating his criminal history under Sec. 4A1.1(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve this issue of foreseeability or the question, raised in appellant's reply brief, whether Sec. 4A1.1(d) permits a sentencing court to consider relevant conduct committed by a co-defendant in calculating a defendant's criminal history.  Count 1 of the superseding indictment alleged a conspiracy between appellant and Mogaji.  Based on the undisputed facts in the PSR, we think there is ample evidence that appellant conspired to commit credit card fraud and that his involvement in the conspiracy continued at least until the date of his arrest, October 20, 1993, when he was found to be carrying \"a list of names, dates of birth, mothers' maiden names, etc.\"  See United States v. Pinnick, 47 F.3d 434, 437 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (district court may rely on undisputed facts in PSR to conclude that defendant committed any extraneous acts offered as relevant conduct).  Indeed, appellant's possession of the list of names and other data on October 20, 1993 was an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.  This was relevant conduct committed by the defendant, himself, while serving a state sentence of probation.  Accordingly, there was no error in adding two criminal history points under Sec. 4A1.1(d).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Restitution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that the district court erred in ordering him to pay restitution to Chase Manhattan Bank in the amount of $7,036.17 for the loss involved in Count 3. The dollar amount was apparently based on credit card charges made by appellant and Mogaji on two separate occasions at Lechmere using a Chase Manhattan Mastercard.  Appellant contends that the amount owed to the bank should be offset by the value of certain goods which they did not succeed in carrying away from Lechmere.  We decline to entertain this claim since it was never raised below.  See United States v. Alzanki, 1995 WL 319028 at * 12 (1st Cir.

Rojo-Alvarez, 944 F.2d 959, 969 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting other circuits)).

Sentence was imposed on July 8, 1994.  This appeal followed.  Appellant seeks to vacate his guilty plea and sentence on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel.  He also alleges various sentencing errors.  In particular, he contends that the district court erred (1) in applying the obstruction-of-justice enhancement based on a finding that he lied about his residence at the suppression hearing;  (2) in assessing him two criminal history points based on a finding that he committed the instant offense (i.e., relevant conduct) while serving a state sentence of probation;  and (3) in determining the amount of restitution.  For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because appellant's conviction resulted from a guilty plea, we derive the pertinent facts from the uncontested portion of the Presentence Investigation Report (PSR), as well as the remainder of the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See United States v. Tejada- Beltran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691951\"><a href=\"/opinion/691951/united-states-v-maximo-e-tejada-beltran-alias-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 107 (1st Cir. 1995).  On October 15, 1993, appellant and his co-defendant, Elizabeth Mogaji, were secretly indicted with five counts of fraudulent use of access devices.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  18 U.S.C. Secs. 1029(a)(2), 2.  Appellant was arrested on October 20, 1993.  At the time of his arrest, he was carrying \"a list of names, dates of birth, mothers' maiden names, etc.\"  An arraignment and bail hearing were held on October 21, 1993.  Appellant informed pre-trial services and the magistrate that he lived at 202 Bellevue Avenue, Providence.  The government proffered that appellant actually resided at 10 Stamford Avenue, Providence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 22, 1993, Mogaji was arrested at 10 Stamford Avenue, where she was living under the name of Althea Medeiros.  On October 25, 1993, federal agents executed a search warrant at 10 Stamford Avenue.  Among the items seized were credit cards in the names of Althea Medeiros and John P. Medeiros and documents in the names of Onyejekwe and Mogaji.  On October 29, 1993, a federal agent seized two plastic bags from the cellar of the Stamford property.  These bags contained incriminating documents, including GM credit cards in the names of Althea and Leonard Medeiros;  counterfeit drivers' licenses in various false names with a photograph of appellant or Mogaji;  a list of names and other data;  and blank credit card applications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 3, 1993, a superseding indictment was returned which added a conspiracy count (Count 1), see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371, to the five counts of credit card fraud (Counts 2-6).  Several months later, appellant filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized at the Stamford property on October 29, 1993.  An evidentiary hearing was held on April 8, 1994.  At this hearing, appellant testified that he lived at 10 Stamford Avenue, and that he had placed the two plastic bags of documents in his own laundry dryer in the cellar at that address.  He admitted that he told the magistrate that he lived at 202 Bellevue Avenue, but testified that he had two residences.  The district court denied the motion to suppress on the ground that appellant lacked standing.  The court stated in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>It further seems to me that insofar as Mr. Onyejekwe is concerned we're going to hold him to what he told the Magistrate Judge.  That he lived at 202 Bellevue.  That was his home.  So that he would have no expectation of privacy in number 10 Stanford Street [sic] in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant pled guilty to Count 3 of the superseding indictment on May 2, 1994.  The remaining counts were dismissed.  Prior to sentencing, a PSR was prepared.  The PSR identified appellant's legal address as 202 Bellevue Avenue.  Appellant objected on the ground that the PSR should reflect that he maintained a second address at 10 Stamford Avenue.  The probation officer responded that during the course of his presentence interview, appellant advised that his legal address was 202 Bellevue Avenue, that Mogaji had moved to 10 Stamford Avenue, and that appellant would periodically stay with her but maintained his legal residence as 202 Bellevue Avenue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A sentencing hearing was held on July 8, 1994.  Based on a total offense level of 15 and a criminal history category of III, the court determined the guideline sentencing range to be 24-30 months.  Appellant was sentenced to 28 months imprisonment, followed by a period of supervised release.  He was also ordered to pay restitution to Chase Manhattan Bank in the amount of $7,036.17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>I. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant, who was represented by three successive court- appointed attorneys, argues that each of his attorneys was inept and that their combined deficient performance rendered his guilty plea involuntary.  He also contends that his third attorney's assistance at the sentencing hearing was incompetent.  Ordinarily, we do not address ineffective assistance of counsel arguments on direct appeal.  This case is no exception.  Appellant alleges, inter alia, that his attorneys failed to investigate his case, were ignorant and ill-prepared, and provided him with misleading information.  These charges depend upon evidentiary matters which are best considered by the district court in the first instance.  See, e.g., United States v. McGill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574332\"><a href=\"/opinion/574332/united-states-v-steven-mcgill/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir. 1991) (fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance must originally be presented to the district court).  Accordingly, appellant's claim of ineffective assistance is not properly before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. SENTENCING</p>\n    <p>A. Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1 directs the district court to increase a defendant's offense level by two levels \"if the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense.\"  The enhancement applies where a defendant commits perjury.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1, comment.  (n.3(b));  see also United States v. Dunnigan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112821\"><a href=\"/opinion/112821/united-states-v-dunnigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1111</span></a></span>, 1116 (1993) (defining perjury).  In the instant case, the district court found that appellant perjured himself at the suppression hearing.  Accordingly, the court made a two level upward adjustment to appellant's offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that the district court failed to identify which portions of his testimony it believed to be false.  This contention is misplaced.  The district court specifically found that appellant was not telling the truth when he testified that he lived at 10 Stamford Avenue, a fact material to the issue of his standing to bring the motion to suppress.  The district court was not required to make further subsidiary findings or to explain its evaluation of appellant's testimony.  See United States v. Tracy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678806\"><a href=\"/opinion/678806/united-states-v-john-l-tracy/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span>, 203 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span> </span>(1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also argues that there is insufficient evidence to support the court's finding that he testified falsely.  We disagree.  Although the location of his residence was an issue from the very beginning, appellant consistently maintained that he lived at 202 Bellevue Avenue until the suppression hearing where, for the first time, he stated to the district court that he maintained a second residence at 10 Stamford Avenue.  The court was entitled to greet this conveniently-timed announcement with skepticism.  Moreover, the record discloses that appellant professes to be indigent.  Under the circumstances, his testimony that he has two residences is implausible, at least without further explanation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are, of course, mindful that, at the arraignment, the government proffered that appellant resided at 10 Stamford Avenue.  The government stated that federal agents \"staked out\" that address and arrested appellant when he left the house.  In addition, documents belonging to appellant were seized from 10 Stamford Avenue.  However, appellant told probation that he would periodically stay with Mogaji after she moved to 10 Stamford Avenue.  This may explain why he was observed departing 10 Stamford Avenue and why some of his personal papers were found there, but the evidence also suggests that it was Mogaji, not appellant, who lived at the Stamford address.  Given the conflicting inferences which may be drawn from the evidence, and with due deference to the sentencing court's superior opportunity to assess witness credibility, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in finding that appellant lied at the suppression hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  United States v. Brum, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571450\"><a href=\"/opinion/571450/united-states-v-beverly-brum/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span>, 819 (1st Cir. 1991) (finding of perjury reviewed for clear error);  United States v. Martinez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553838\"><a href=\"/opinion/553838/united-states-v-victor-martinez-united-states-of-america-v-hector-vidal/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span>, 925 (1st Cir. 1991) (where there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances, a sentencing court's choice among supportable alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Criminal History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's criminal history includes a January 21, 1993 state conviction for embezzlement and an April 2, 1993 state conviction for credit card fraud.  In both cases, appellant was sentenced to probation.  Acting pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.1(c), the district court assessed him two criminal history points for these prior sentences.  The court then added two additional criminal history points under Sec. 4A1.1(d) on the ground that appellant committed the relevant conduct while serving a sentence of probation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the district court erred in assessing him the two additional points under Sec. 4A1.1(d).  In particular, he contends that he should not be held accountable for the conduct involved in Count 6, namely, eighteen cash withdrawals made by Mogaji using a GM Mastercard between October 26, 1992 and June 13, 1993.  Appellant claims that he was under immigration detention when these withdrawals were made and was facing prosecution for use of the same credit card.  Under the circumstances, he argues, Mogaji's conduct was not foreseeable, and, so, not relevant conduct within the meaning of U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B.3.  Accordingly, he further argues, the district court should not have considered this conduct in calculating his criminal history under Sec. 4A1.1(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve this issue of foreseeability or the question, raised in appellant's reply brief, whether Sec. 4A1.1(d) permits a sentencing court to consider relevant conduct committed by a co-defendant in calculating a defendant's criminal history.  Count 1 of the superseding indictment alleged a conspiracy between appellant and Mogaji.  Based on the undisputed facts in the PSR, we think there is ample evidence that appellant conspired to commit credit card fraud and that his involvement in the conspiracy continued at least until the date of his arrest, October 20, 1993, when he was found to be carrying \"a list of names, dates of birth, mothers' maiden names, etc.\"  See United States v. Pinnick, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"689111\"><a href=\"/opinion/689111/united-states-v-shannon-o-pinnick-aka-scott-a-bishop/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span>, 437 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (district court may rely on undisputed facts in PSR to conclude that defendant committed any extraneous acts offered as relevant conduct).  Indeed, appellant's possession of the list of names and other data on October 20, 1993 was an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.  This was relevant conduct committed by the defendant, himself, while serving a state sentence of probation.  Accordingly, there was no error in adding two criminal history points under Sec. 4A1.1(d).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Restitution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that the district court erred in ordering him to pay restitution to Chase Manhattan Bank in the amount of $7,036.17 for the loss involved in Count 3. The dollar amount was apparently based on credit card charges made by appellant and Mogaji on two separate occasions at Lechmere using a Chase Manhattan Mastercard.  Appellant contends that the amount owed to the bank should be offset by the value of certain goods which they did not succeed in carrying away from Lechmere.  We decline to entertain this claim since it was never raised below.  See United States v. Alzanki, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">319028</span> </span>at * 12 (1st Cir.

We note that appellant's appendix includes many documents which were not filed in the district court-including transcripts of testimony before the grand jury-and are, thus, outside the record.  See Fed.  R. App.  P. 10(a).  These latter documents, of course, cannot inform our decision</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Elizabeth Mogaji is appellant's girlfriend</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We also reject appellant's contention that the district court erred in failing to evaluate his testimony \"in a light most favorable to the defendant[,]\" as required by U.S.S.G.

R. Crim.  P. 32(c)(3)(D) (current version at Rule 32(c)(1)).  The PSR assessed appellant two criminal history points under Sec. 4A1.1(d).  In his objections to the PSR and at sentencing, defense counsel argued that this was error because the specific offense to which Onyejekwe pled guilty (Count 3) occurred before Onyejekwe was placed on probation.  This objection to the PSR's legal conclusion did not dispute a factual assertion.  We add that in the addendum to the PSR, the probation officer clarified that the criminal history points under Sec. 4A1.1(d) were based on relevant conduct.  Defense counsel never took issue with the conclusion that the conduct involved in the dismissed counts was relevant conduct</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Appellant also argues that Chase Manhattan Bank will receive a windfall since he and Mogaji were each ordered to pay $7,036.17 in restitution.  We think it plain that appellant will receive credit for restitution paid by Mogaji towards the loss involved in Count 3, and vice versa</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We also deny appellant's request that we order the district court to produce the audio recording of the suppression hearing.  Appellant contends that the court reporter prepared two transcripts of his testimony at that hearing, that the transcripts differ, and that it cannot be determined which of the two is accurate without comparing them to the audio recording.  He also suggests that the district court may have relied on an inaccurate transcript of his testimony when it determined that he perjured himself.  Appellant has not followed the proper procedure for clarifying the record.  See Fed.  R. App.  P. 10(e).  In any event, we see nothing to be gained by remanding the matter to the district court.
