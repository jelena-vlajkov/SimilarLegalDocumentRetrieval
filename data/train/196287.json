Joseph  Simanonok  appeals  from the\r                                 \r\n\ndistrict  court's dismissal  of his  complaint under  Fed. R.\r\n\nCiv. P.  12(b)(1) and  (6) and  its denial  of his  motion to\r\n\namend his complaint.  We affirm.\r\n\n                    I.  Background\r                                              \r\n\n          Simanonok sued  the Northeast Federal  Credit Union\r\n\n(NEFCU)  and  one  of  its employees  for  alleged  negligent\r\n\ncompliance with Internal Revenue  Service (IRS) levies on his\r\n\nbank account.  He  sued IRS employees for issuing  the levies\r\n\nand  for  filing  notices of  lien  on  his  property in  New\r\n\nHampshire,  claiming that he had no obligation to pay federal\r\n\nincome tax since the IRS could not tax or sanction members of\r\n\nthe  United States Armed Forces and that the IRS's levies and\r\n\nnotices of lien were invalid.   In part, he asserted that the\r\n\nIRS had  levied on exempt  property and had  violated certain\r\n\nstatutorily required procedures in assessing his tax.\r\n\n          Questioning    the   court's    jurisdiction   over\r\n\nSimanonok's suit, a magistrate judge ordered him to amend his\r\n\ncomplaint  in  specific   ways  to  establish   jurisdiction.\r\n\nSimanonok moved to vacate the order, and the magistrate judge\r\n\ntreated his  motion as  an amended complaint.   Subsequently,\r\n\nthe magistrate  judge denied a separate  attempt by Simanonok\r\n\nto  file an  amended complaint.   The  district court  denied\r\n\nSimanonok's motion to reconsider the denial.  In  response to\r\n\ndefendants'   Rule  12(b)   motions,  the   magistrate  judge\r\r\n\nrecommended dismissing some counts  of the complaint for lack\r\n\nof jurisdiction and others  for failure to state a  claim for\r\n\nrelief.   The  district  court issued  orders dismissing  the\r\n\ncomplaint.\r\n\n                         II.  Discussion\r                                                    \r\n\n          A.   District Court's Failure to  Reject Magistrate\r\n               Judge's Actions                               \r                                                                        \r\n\n          Simanonok challenges the district  court's adoption\r\n\nof the magistrate judge's  reports recommending dismissal  of\r\n\nthe  complaint  and  rejection   of  the  amended  complaint.\r\n\nAccording  to Simanonok,  the  magistrate  judge should  have\r\n\nissued  proposed findings of fact  and held a  hearing on the\r\n\nmotions.   Simanonok also asserts as error the failure of the\r\n\ncourt  to obtain  his  consent to  action  by the  magistrate\r\n\njudge.\r\n\n          We find  no error  in the proceedings  below.   The\r\n\nFederal Magistrates Act clearly  permitted the district court\r\n\nto  refer to the magistrate  judge the Rule  12(b)(1) and (6)\r\n\nmotions  for a  report and  recommendation, see  28 U.S.C.   \r                                                           \r\n\n636(b)(1)(B),  and the motion to amend for decision.  See id.\r                                                                         \r\n\n   636(b)(1)(A); Pagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d 343, 346 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1993).    The magistrate  judge was  not  required to  hold a\r\n\nhearing on the Rule 12(b) motions, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b);\r                                                  \r\n\naccord C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; F. Elliott, 12 Federal Practice\r                                                                         \r\n\n&amp;  Procedure     3076.7, at  56  (1995  Supp.),  or to  issue\r                        \r\n\nproposed  findings of  fact.   See  Fed.  R. Civ.  P.  72(b).\r                                              \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nBecause the case was not referred to the magistrate judge for\r\n\nentry   of  final  judgment,   Simanonok's  consent  was  not\r\n\nrequired.  See 28 U.S.C.   636(c)(1)-(2).\r                          \r\n\n          Moreover,  the  district court  did  not abuse  its\r\n\ndiscretion in  denying Simanonok's  motion to reconsider  the\r\n\ndenial  of  his amended  complaint.    Simanonok's motion  to\r\n\nvacate the order  to amend  his complaint was  treated as  an\r\n\namended  complaint.  Thus, as of the time Simanonok sought to\r\n\nfile  the  amended  complaint,  he had  already  amended  the\r\n\ncomplaint once as of right within the meaning of Fed. R. Civ.\r\n\nP. 15(a).  See Elliott v. Foufas, 867 F.2d 877, 882 (5th Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1989).  Nor did the amended complaint cure the jurisdictional\r\n\ndeficiencies  of  the  complaint, or  allege  any  wrongdoing\r\n\nwhatever by the persons Simanonok sought to add as parties to\r\n\nthe  amended complaint.  Hence, denial  was appropriate.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nLong  v.  United States,  972  F.2d  1174,  1183  (10th  Cir.\r                                   \r\n\n1992).1\r\n\n          B.     Dismissal  for   Lack   of  Subject   Matter\r                                                                         \r\n\nJurisdiction\r                        \r\n\n          The district court dismissed  certain counts of the\r\n\ncomplaint  against the  IRS  defendants for  lack of  subject\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Because other  grounds in the record  support the court's\r\ndenial of Simanonok's motion to  amend his complaint, we need\r\nnot consider his claim that he properly served the defendants\r\nor was prevented  from doing  so or that  the defendants  had\r\nactual notice of the  amended complaint.  See Acha  v. United\r                                                                         \r\nStates, 910 F.2d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                  \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nmatter jurisdiction, construing those counts to seek a refund\r\n\nor  to challenge  Simanonok's  underlying tax  liability.   A\r\n\ntaxpayer who seeks a refund  or who challenges his underlying\r\n\ntax liability must allege that he has paid his taxes  in full\r\n\nand has  filed an administrative refund  claim before seeking\r\n\nrelief  in district  court.   See  McMillen v.  United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nDepartment of Treasury,  960 F.2d 187, 188-89 (1st Cir. 1991)\r                                  \r\n\n(per  curiam).  Simanonok did  not, and so  the dismissal was\r\n\ncorrect  to the  extent  that Simanonok  sought  a refund  or\r\n\nchallenged his underlying tax liability.  \r\n\n          Simanonok  has asserted  various objections  to the\r\n\ndismissal, none of which we find meritorious.  His claim (and\r\n\ncertain  related  claims) that  the  IRS  had assessed  taxes\r\n\nagainst  him with respect to income paid to his former spouse\r\n\ndirectly challenges his underlying  tax liability.  Given his\r\n\nfailure  to allege that he had paid  the tax in full or filed\r\n\nan administrative refund claim, the court had no jurisdiction\r\n\nover this claim.   See id.2   The same  is true of his  claim\r                                      \r\n\nthat  the IRS  had no  jurisdiction over  him since  he  is a\r\n\nmember of the United States Armed Forces.\r\n\n          Although  Simanonok also  argues that  28 U.S.C.   \r\n\n1442a,  the Federal Tax Lien  Act of 1966  (together with the\r\n\nUniform  Commercial  Code),  and  5 U.S.C.     706  conferred\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  In  any  event, this  claim  was  never  asserted in  the\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\njurisdiction on the court  over his suit, those  laws plainly\r\n\ndid not do so.  Moreover, long ago we rejected the claim that\r\n\n28 U.S.C.   2463 confers jurisdiction on district courts with\r\n\nrespect to  suits involving  property  seized by  levy.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nMorris v. United States,  303 F.2d 533, 535 (1st  Cir. 1962),\r                                   \r\n\ncert. denied, 371 U.S. 827 (1962).  \r                        \r\n\n          Simanonok correctly asserts that  28 U.S.C.   1340,\r\n\ntogether with the waiver of sovereign immunity in 28 U.S.C.  \r\n\n2410, confers  jurisdiction  on district  courts over  \"quiet\r\n\ntitle\"  suits alleging defects in IRS levies and liens.  See,\r                                                                         \r\n\ne.g., Harrell v. United States, 13 F.3d 232, 234-35 (7th Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1993).  However, he fails to specify any claim  of his which,\r\n\nunder  those statutes,  should  have survived  the motion  to\r\n\ndismiss for lack of  jurisdiction.  As a consequence,  he has\r\n\nwaived any error  the district  court may have  made in  that\r\n\nrespect.  See United States v.  Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17  (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082 (1990)  (claims are deemed\r                               \r\n\nwaived  if  they  are merely  adverted  to  in  a perfunctory\r\n\nfashion without any attempt at developed argumentation).\r\n\n          C.   Dismissal  for Failure  to  State a  Claim For\r                                                                         \r\n\nRelief\r                  \r\n\n          Simanonok argues that the court erred in dismissing\r\n\ncertain  counts of the complaint for failure to state a claim\r\n\nfor relief.  His argument  that he stated a claim  for relief\r\n\nagainst  the NEFCU defendants is  unpersuasive in view of the\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nimmunity accorded them under  26 U.S.C.   6332(e).3   We also\r\n\nreject his  arguments relative  to the following  claims: (1)\r\n\nthat his bank account and  retirement income were exempt from\r\n\nlevy under 26 U.S.C.    6334(a)(10) and (d)(3); (2)  that the\r\n\nIRS was required to file a notice of lien before it levied on\r\n\nhis  property; and  (3) that  the lien  notices filed  in New\r\n\nHampshire failed to  comply with  26 U.S.C.    6065 and  N.H.\r\n\nRev. Stat. Ann.   454-B:3 &amp; B:4.  \r\n\n          By failing to develop  any argument whatever on the\r\n\nissue, Simanonok has waived  his claim that his  bank account\r\n\nand  retirement income were  exempt from levy.   See Zannino,\r                                                                        \r\n\n895 F.2d at 17.  His  other two claims did not state a  claim\r\n\nfor relief.  The  Internal Revenue Code does not  require the\r\n\nIRS to file  notices of  lien before it  levies on  property.\r\n\nSee  26  U.S.C.      6331(a),   (d)(1)-(2)  (describing   the\r               \r\n\nprerequisites  for  levying on  property).    In addition,   \r\n\n6065's verification  requirement  applies only  to  documents\r\n\nwhich taxpayers send  to the IRS.  See In  re White, 168 B.R.\r                                                               \r\n\n825,  833 (D.  Conn. 1994),  appeal dismissed,  95-1 U.S.T.C.\r                                                         \r\n\n(CCH)    50,215 (D. Conn. 1995).  Hence,   6065 did not apply\r\n\nto  the  notices in  question here.    Moreover, even  if New\r\n\nHampshire  law  required IRS  officials  to  certify or  sign\r\n\nnotices of lien, the form and content of IRS  notices of lien\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  The   district   court   apparently    asserted   pendent\r\njurisdiction  over the  state  law claims  against the  NEFCU\r\ndefendants.\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nare  not subject to state law  requirements.  See 26 U.S.C.  \r                                                             \r\n\n6323(f)(3). \r\n\n                    III.  Motion for Sanctions\r                                                          \r\n\n          In a separately filed motion, the IRS has requested\r\n\nsanctions of  $2,000 in  lieu of  costs and  attorney's fees,\r\n\nasserting that Simanonok's appeal was frivolous.  See Fed. R.\r                                                                 \r\n\nApp.  P.  38(a).     In  part,  this  appeal  was  frivolous.\r\n\nSimanonok claimed that his  military status exempted him from\r\n\nfederal income taxation, a claim which he knew was frivolous.\r\n\nOther courts have told him so, and he has been sanctioned for\r\n\nmaking it.

Furthermore, he failed to  develop obvious and\r\n\npossibly  meritorious arguments on  appeal, casting  doubt on\r\n\nthe  sincerity with which  he brought  certain claims  in the\r\n\nfirst  place.

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simanonok sued the Northeast Federal Credit Union (NEFCU) and one of its employees for alleged negligent compliance with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) levies on his bank account.  He sued IRS employees for issuing the levies and for filing notices of lien on his property in New Hampshire, claiming that he had no obligation to pay federal income tax since the IRS could not tax or sanction members of the United States Armed Forces and that the IRS's levies and notices of lien were invalid.  In part, he asserted that the IRS had levied on exempt property and had violated certain statutorily required procedures in assessing his tax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Questioning the court's jurisdiction over Simanonok's suit, a magistrate judge ordered him to amend his complaint in specific ways to establish jurisdiction.  Simanonok moved to vacate the order, and the magistrate judge treated his motion as an amended complaint.  Subsequently, the magistrate judge denied a separate attempt by Simanonok to file an amended complaint.  The district court denied Simanonok's motion to reconsider the denial.  In response to defendants' Rule 12(b) motions, the magistrate judge recommended dismissing some counts of the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and others for failure to state a claim for relief.  The district court issued orders dismissing the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. District Court's Failure to Reject Magistrate Judge's Actions</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simanonok challenges the district court's adoption of the magistrate judge's reports recommending dismissal of the complaint and rejection of the amended complaint.  According to Simanonok, the magistrate judge should have issued proposed findings of fact and held a hearing on the motions.  Simanonok also asserts as error the failure of the court to obtain his consent to action by the magistrate judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no error in the proceedings below.  The Federal Magistrates Act clearly permitted the district court to refer to the magistrate judge the Rule 12(b)(1) and (6) motions for a report and recommendation, see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(1)(B), and the motion to amend for decision.  See id. Sec. 636(b)(1)(A);  Pagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d 343, 346 (1st Cir.1993).  The magistrate judge was not required to hold a hearing on the Rule 12(b) motions, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b);  accord C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; F. Elliott, 12 Federal Practice &amp; Procedure Sec. 3076.7, at 56 (1995 Supp.), or to issue proposed findings of fact.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b).  Because the case was not referred to the magistrate judge for entry of final judgment, Simanonok's consent was not required.  See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(c)(1)-(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Simanonok's motion to reconsider the denial of his amended complaint.  Simanonok's motion to vacate the order to amend his complaint was treated as an amended complaint.  Thus, as of the time Simanonok sought to file the amended complaint, he had already amended the complaint once as of right within the meaning of Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a).  See Elliott v. Foufas, 867 F.2d 877, 882 (5th Cir.1989).  Nor did the amended complaint cure the jurisdictional deficiencies of the complaint, or allege any wrongdoing whatever by the persons Simanonok sought to add as parties to the amended complaint.  Hence, denial was appropriate.  See Long v. United States, 972 F.2d 1174, 1183 (10th Cir.1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Dismissal for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed certain counts of the complaint against the IRS defendants for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, construing those counts to seek a refund or to challenge Simanonok's underlying tax liability.  A taxpayer who seeks a refund or who challenges his underlying tax liability must allege that he has paid his taxes in full and has filed an administrative refund claim before seeking relief in district court.  See McMillen v. United States Department of Treasury, 960 F.2d 187, 188-89 (1st Cir.1991) (per curiam).  Simanonok did not, and so the dismissal was correct to the extent that Simanonok sought a refund or challenged his underlying tax liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simanonok has asserted various objections to the dismissal, none of which we find meritorious.  His claim (and certain related claims) that the IRS had assessed taxes against him with respect to income paid to his former spouse directly challenges his underlying tax liability.  Given his failure to allege that he had paid the tax in full or filed an administrative refund claim, the court had no jurisdiction over this claim.  See id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The same is true of his claim that the IRS had no jurisdiction over him since he is a member of the United States Armed Forces.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Simanonok also argues that 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1442a, the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 (together with the Uniform Commercial Code), and 5 U.S.C. Sec. 706 conferred jurisdiction on the court over his suit, those laws plainly did not do so.  Moreover, long ago we rejected the claim that 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2463 confers jurisdiction on district courts with respect to suits involving property seized by levy.  See Morris v. United States, 303 F.2d 533, 535 (1st Cir.1962), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 827 (1962).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simanonok correctly asserts that 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1340, together with the waiver of sovereign immunity in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2410, confers jurisdiction on district courts over \"quiet title\" suits alleging defects in IRS levies and liens.  See, e.g., Harrell v. United States, 13 F.3d 232, 234-35 (7th Cir.1993).  However, he fails to specify any claim of his which, under those statutes, should have survived the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  As a consequence, he has waived any error the district court may have made in that respect.  See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082 (1990) (claims are deemed waived if they are merely adverted to in a perfunctory fashion without any attempt at developed argumentation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Dismissal for Failure to State a Claim For Relief</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simanonok argues that the court erred in dismissing certain counts of the complaint for failure to state a claim for relief.  His argument that he stated a claim for relief against the NEFCU defendants is unpersuasive in view of the immunity accorded them under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6332(e).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We also reject his arguments relative to the following claims:  (1) that his bank account and retirement income were exempt from levy under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6334(a)(10) and (d)(3);  (2) that the IRS was required to file a notice of lien before it levied on his property;  and (3) that the lien notices filed in New Hampshire failed to comply with 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6065 and N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. Sec. 454-B:3 &amp; B:4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By failing to develop any argument whatever on the issue, Simanonok has waived his claim that his bank account and retirement income were exempt from levy.  See Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17.  His other two claims did not state a claim for relief.  The Internal Revenue Code does not require the IRS to file notices of lien before it levies on property.  See 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6331(a), (d)(1)-(2) (describing the prerequisites for levying on property).  In addition, Sec. 6065's verification requirement applies only to documents which taxpayers send to the IRS.  See In re White, 168 B.R. 825, 833 (D.Conn.1994), appeal dismissed, 95-1 U.S.T.C.  (CCH) p 50,215 (D.Conn.1995).  Hence, Sec. 6065 did not apply to the notices in question here.  Moreover, even if New Hampshire law required IRS officials to certify or sign notices of lien, the form and content of IRS notices of lien are not subject to state law requirements.  See 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6323(f)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Motion for Sanctions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a separately filed motion, the IRS has requested sanctions of $2,000 in lieu of costs and attorney's fees, asserting that Simanonok's appeal was frivolous.  See Fed.  R.App. P. 38(a).  In part, this appeal was frivolous.  Simanonok claimed that his military status exempted him from federal income taxation, a claim which he knew was frivolous.  Other courts have told him so, and he has been sanctioned for making it.  He also should have known that his allegation that 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1442a and 2463, the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 (and the Uniform Commercial Code), and 5 U.S.C. Sec. 706 authorized the court's jurisdiction over his claims was not meritorious.  Furthermore, he failed to develop obvious and possibly meritorious arguments on appeal, casting doubt on the sincerity with which he brought certain claims in the first place.  Finally, he has not objected to the imposition of sanctions, e.g., on the ground that he cannot pay them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we do not think that all of Simanonok's claims on appeal were frivolous, even though we found none of them to be persuasive.  For example, Simanonok might reasonably have believed that the magistrate judge should have held a hearing or issued proposed findings of fact.  The district court referred the Rule 12(b) motions to the magistrate judge under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(1)(B), which states that \"a judge may also designate a magistrate to conduct hearings [and] to submit to a judge of the court proposed findings of fact.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the appeal was frivolous in part, we order payment of double costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed;  double costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Because other grounds in the record support the court's denial of Simanonok's motion to amend his complaint, we need not consider his claim that he properly served the defendants or was prevented from doing so or that the defendants had actual notice of the amended complaint.

United States, 910 F.2d 28, 30 (1st Cir.1990)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In any event, this claim was never asserted in the complaint</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The district court apparently asserted pendent jurisdiction over the state law claims against the NEFCU defendants</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

A taxpayer who seeks a refund or who challenges his underlying tax liability must allege that he has paid his taxes in full and has filed an administrative refund claim before seeking relief in district court.

His claim (and certain related claims) that the IRS had assessed taxes against him with respect to income paid to his former spouse directly challenges his underlying tax liability.  Given his failure to allege that he had paid the tax in full or filed an administrative refund claim, the court had no jurisdiction over this claim.  See id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The same is true of his claim that the IRS had no jurisdiction over him since he is a member of the United States Armed Forces.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Simanonok also argues that 28 U.S.C.

Moreover, long ago we rejected the claim that 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2463 confers jurisdiction on district courts with respect to suits involving property seized by levy.  See Morris v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"257305\"><a href=\"/opinion/257305/gertrude-welch-morris-v-united-states-of-america-verna-d-morris-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">533</span></a></span>, 535 (1st Cir.1962), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">827</span> </span>(1962).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simanonok correctly asserts that 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1340, together with the waiver of sovereign immunity in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2410, confers jurisdiction on district courts over \"quiet title\" suits alleging defects in IRS levies and liens.  See, e.g., Harrell v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"659928\"><a href=\"/opinion/659928/gaylon-l-harrell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span>, 234-35 (7th Cir.1993).  However, he fails to specify any claim of his which, under those statutes, should have survived the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  As a consequence, he has waived any error the district court may have made in that respect.  See United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span> </span>(1990) (claims are deemed waived if they are merely adverted to in a perfunctory fashion without any attempt at developed argumentation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Dismissal for Failure to State a Claim For Relief</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simanonok argues that the court erred in dismissing certain counts of the complaint for failure to state a claim for relief.  His argument that he stated a claim for relief against the NEFCU defendants is unpersuasive in view of the immunity accorded them under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6332(e).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We also reject his arguments relative to the following claims:  (1) that his bank account and retirement income were exempt from levy under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6334(a)(10) and (d)(3);  (2) that the IRS was required to file a notice of lien before it levied on his property;  and (3) that the lien notices filed in New Hampshire failed to comply with 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6065 and N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. Sec. 454-B:3 &amp; B:4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By failing to develop any argument whatever on the issue, Simanonok has waived his claim that his bank account and retirement income were exempt from levy.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Zannino,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>.  His other two claims did not state a claim for relief.  The Internal Revenue Code does not require the IRS to file notices of lien before it levies on property.  See 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6331(a), (d)(1)-(2) (describing the prerequisites for levying on property).  In addition, Sec. 6065's verification requirement applies only to documents which taxpayers send to the IRS.  See In re White, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2013886\"><a href=\"/opinion/2013886/in-re-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span>, 833 (D.Conn.1994), appeal dismissed, 95-1 U.S.T.C.  (CCH) p 50,215 (D.Conn.1995).  Hence, Sec. 6065 did not apply to the notices in question here.  Moreover, even if New Hampshire law required IRS officials to certify or sign notices of lien, the form and content of IRS notices of lien are not subject to state law requirements.  See 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6323(f)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Motion for Sanctions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a separately filed motion, the IRS has requested sanctions of $2,000 in lieu of costs and attorney's fees, asserting that Simanonok's appeal was frivolous.  See Fed.  R.App. P. 38(a).  In part, this appeal was frivolous.  Simanonok claimed that his military status exempted him from federal income taxation, a claim which he knew was frivolous.  Other courts have told him so, and he has been sanctioned for making it.  He also should have known that his allegation that 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1442a and 2463, the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 (and the Uniform Commercial Code), and 5 U.S.C. Sec. 706 authorized the court's jurisdiction over his claims was not meritorious.  Furthermore, he failed to develop obvious and possibly meritorious arguments on appeal, casting doubt on the sincerity with which he brought certain claims in the first place.  Finally, he has not objected to the imposition of sanctions, e.g., on the ground that he cannot pay them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we do not think that all of Simanonok's claims on appeal were frivolous, even though we found none of them to be persuasive.  For example, Simanonok might reasonably have believed that the magistrate judge should have held a hearing or issued proposed findings of fact.  The district court referred the Rule 12(b) motions to the magistrate judge under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(1)(B), which states that \"a judge may also designate a magistrate to conduct hearings [and] to submit to a judge of the court proposed findings of fact.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the appeal was frivolous in part, we order payment of double costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed;  double costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Because other grounds in the record support the court's denial of Simanonok's motion to amend his complaint, we need not consider his claim that he properly served the defendants or was prevented from doing so or that the defendants had actual notice of the amended complaint.

United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546072\"><a href=\"/opinion/546072/jose-rosado-acha-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">910</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.1990)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In any event, this claim was never asserted in the complaint</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The district court apparently asserted pendent jurisdiction over the state law claims against the NEFCU defendants</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
