Plaintiff  requested  a  voluntary\n                      \n\ndismissal  without prejudice.   The district  court \"granted\"\n\nplaintiff's motion,  but dismissed with  prejudice and denied\n\nplaintiff's motion for reconsideration, which objected to the\n\ndismissal with prejudice.   Plaintiff has appealed from those\n\norders.  \n\n     While  neither  the  plaintiff nor  the  district  court\n\nreferred  to  any  particular  rule,  we  conclude  that  the\n\ndismissal plaintiff  requested,  and the  court entered,  was\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.  41(a)(2) (voluntary dismissal by\n\norder of court), as there is no basis in the record before us\n\nfor an involuntary dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b).  We\n\nconclude that  the court abused its  discretion in dismissing\n\nwith prejudice without first giving plaintiff the opportunity\n\nto withdraw  her request for  voluntary dismissal.   In  this\n\nregard, we agree generally with the discussions in Gravatt v.\n                                                             \n\nColumbia University, 845 F.2d 54,  55-56 (2d Cir. 1988),  and\n                   \n\nAndes  v. Versant Corp., 788 F.2d 1033, 1037 (4th Cir. 1986),\n                      \n\nthat if a plaintiff's motion to  dismiss without prejudice is\n\nto  be denied, the  plaintiff ordinarily should  be given the\n\nopportunity  to allow  the  case to  proceed  on the  merits,\n\nrather than being subjected to a dismissal with prejudice.\n\n     Plaintiff  asks that  we  direct the  district court  to\n\ndismiss without  prejudice.  We will not do so because on the\n\npresent  record we can not say that plaintiff was entitled as\n\n                             -2-\n\na  matter  of  law  to  an  unconditional  dismissal  without\n\nprejudice.     We summarily vacate the order of dismissal and\n\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this  opinion.\n\nLoc.
