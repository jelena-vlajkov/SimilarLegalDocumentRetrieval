Appellant  has challenged  his\r                    WATSON   Senior Judge\r                                         \r\n\nconviction for conspiracy to import  marijuana in violation of 21\r\n\nUSC     592 and 963.  Appellant claims  that it was error for the\r\n\ntrial court to deny a motion for a bill of particulars, to deny a\r\n\nmistrial after prejudicial testimony, to allow hearsay  testimony\r\n\nlinking a  telephone number used in the conspiracy to appellant's\r\n\nfish  market, to  deny  his Rule  29  motion for  acquittal,  and\r\n\nfinally,  to increase his sentencing Guideline level for having a\r\n\nmanagerial  role  in  the  crime.   For  the  following  reasons,\r\n\nAppellant's claims are found to be without merit.\r\n\nDenial of the Bill of Particulars\r          Denial of the Bill of Particulars\r\n\n          Appellant  was named  in Count  One of  the Indictment.\r\n\nThat  count described a conspiracy that began on or about October\r\n\n26, 1991 with the object of importing marijuana from Colombia and\r\n\nended  on November 6, 1991  when the conspirators  found out that\r\n\nthe  boat for  which they had  been searching had  been seized by\r\n\nVenezuelan authorities.   Appellant was described  as joining the\r\n\nconspiracy on November  2, 1991, when,  in a meeting at  his fish\r\n\nstore, he agreed  to supply the boat and crew  needed to meet the\r\n\nColombian  boat at a point ten to  fifteen miles off the coast of\r\n\nSt. Croix, U.S.  Virgin Islands.  Count I  of the indictment ends\r\n\nwith an allegation that  one of the conspirators made  some calls\r\n\non November 6, 1991, after which he announced  to the others that\r\n\nthe  boat had  been seized  by Venezuelan  authorities.   He then\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\ncalled St. Croix to have the others return to Puerto Rico.\r\n\n          Appellant  claims that  it was  error for  the District\r\n\nCourt  to deny his  bill of  particulars asking  for the  date on\r\n\nwhich   the  Colombian   boat  was   seized  by   the  Venezuelan\r\n\nauthorities.  According to  Appellant that information would have\r\n\nallowed him  to present a  defense that,  for him,  the crime  of\r\n\nconspiracy to  import marijuana had become  impossible to achieve\r\n\nbecause the boat was seized prior  to November 2, 1991, before he\r\n\nwas alleged to have met with the other conspirators. \r\n\n          According to Appellant,  the anticipated delivery  date\r\n\nof November 4th means that the boat had to leave Colombia four to\r\n\nfive days  earlier,  in  which  case its  seizure  by  Venezuelan\r\n\nauthorities had  to take  place before appellant's  first contact\r\n\nwith the other conspirators at 5:00 P.M. on November 2d.\r\n\n          The government has defended  the denial of the bill  of\r\n\nparticulars  on   the  grounds   that  the   indictment  provided\r\n\nsufficient  information, that  the  government did  not have  the\r\n\nseizure  information,  that it  provided  full  discovery in  any\r\n\nevent, and  that if the  seizure did  indeed take place  prior to\r\n\nNovember 2d,  the conspirators would  most likely have  found out\r\n\nabout  it quickly and would  not have continued  their efforts to\r\n\nmeet the Colombian boat. The government suggests that the seizure\r\n\ntook place  after  the rendezvous  failed.   The government  also\r\n\nasserts that the defendant  was not prejudiced by the lack of the\r\n\ninformation. \r\n\n          To begin with, the  denial of a bill of  particulars is\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nreversible error only  if it is a clear  abuse of discretion that\r\n\ncauses  actual prejudice  to  a  defendant's substantial  rights.\r\n\nUnited States v. Hallock, 941 F.2d  36, 40 (1st Cir. 1991).  This\r                                  \r\n\nindictment  contained  more  than  enough  information  to  allow\r\n\ndefendant to prepare his defense.  In fact, it is prolix compared\r\n\nto the indictment under discussion in United States v. Paiva, 892\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 148  (1st Cir. 1989), which did not contain any precise time\r\n\nperiod for  the conspiracy and did  not even specify the  date on\r\n\nwhich the defendant joined it.  Nevertheless this Court held that\r\n\nthe temporal  specifications of  \"early  1983\" and  \"the fall  of\r\n\n1983\"  were sufficient  to  allow the  preparation  of a  defense\r\n\nwithout a bill of  particulars.  A fortiori the  temporal details\r                                                     \r\n\nin  this indictment  were sufficient  to allow  the  defendant to\r\n\npresent  a defense that the  conspiracy had ended  before he came\r\n\ninto  the picture.   It  is noteworthy that  the record  shows no\r\n\nattempt  by defendant  to pursue  alternative means  of obtaining\r\n\ninformation about the date of the boat seizure. \r\n\n          Even  if we  go  past the  correctness  of denying  the\r\n\nelaboration  of   an  adequate  indictment,   there  is   another\r\n\ninsurmountable obstacle to the  request for information about the\r\n\ndate of seizure.\r\n\n          Denial of this bill  of particulars as to the  time and\r\n\nlocation  of  the  seizure could  not  possibly  be  an abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion  because it could not be the  basis of a legal defense\r\n\nto the  charge of  conspiracy.   It  has been  held  that \"...  a\r\n\nculpable  conspiracy  may  exist  even  though,  because  of  the\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nmisapprehension  of the  conspirators  as to  certain facts,  the\r\n\nsubstantive  crime which is the  object of the  conspiracy may be\r\n\nimpossible  to commit.\" United States v. Waldron, 590 F.2d 33, 34\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1979).  In that case the conspirators thought that they\r\n\nwere  working to import and  sell valuable stolen  paintings.  In\r\n\nreality, the only painting they delivered to Boston was a forgery\r\n\nworth  less than  the $5000  minimum of  the provision  making it\r\n\nunlawful to knowingly sell stolen goods.\r\n\n          Appellant's   argument  resembles   the  one   made  by\r\n\nappellants in United States v. Giry, 818 F.2d 120 (1st Cir. 1987)\r                                             \r\n\nthat  because the  persons who  were to  import the  cocaine were\r\n\nagents of the Drug Enforcement Agency [DEA] the importation could\r\n\nnever  actually  occur.   The  court  rejected  \"...  the  faulty\r\n\nassumption that  an expressed conspiratorial objective is negated\r\n\nby  its factual impossibility.\"  818 F.2d at 126.  Here appellant\r\n\njoined  in  a  conspiracy  and  performed an  essential  role  in\r\n\nobtaining  a boat and crew needed  to accomplish the crime.  Even\r\n\nif intervening events had made the accomplishment of the criminal\r\n\npurpose impossible all the elements of a criminal conspiracy were\r\n\npresent.   There  is no  basis for  making a  distinction between\r\n\nthose  who  start  a  conspiracy  that  is  impossible  from  the\r\n\nbeginning  and  one who  joins in  a  conspiracy that  has become\r\n\nimpossible due to intervening events unknown to the conspirators.\r\n\n          Appellant  has  cited three  cases for  the proposition\r\n\nthat  a  conspiracy ends  when  its purpose  is  thwarted, United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.  Roshko, 969 F.2d 1, 8 (2d Cir. 1992); United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nSerrano, 870 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1989); and Krulewitch v.  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates, 336 U.S. 440,  443-44 (1949).  This proposition  can only\r                \r\n\nbe true if the conduct of the conspirators  is no longer directed\r\n\ntowards accomplishment of the  goal of the conspiracy, impossible\r\n\nor not.   In the cases cited  by appellant it  was held that  the\r\n\nconspiracy  had ended either because its goal had been reached or\r\n\nbecause the conspirators had given up.  There was no continuation\r\n\nof acts designed to further the conspiracy.\r\n\n          In United States  v. Roshko,   969 F.2d 1,  8 (2d  Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1992), appellant's conspiracy was held to have ended successfully\r\n\nwhen he obtained a  green card by means of  a sham marriage to  a\r\n\nfirst  \"wife.\"  The government, seeking  to justify indicting him\r\n\nafter the five year statute of limitations had run on that crime,\r\n\nhad argued that the conspiracy continued through the later points\r\n\nin  time when  he divorced  that first  wife and  married another\r\n\nwoman.  The court held that it was the obtaining of  a green card\r\n\nthat  was  the  object  of  the  conspiracy  and  the  conspiracy\r\n\nterminated when that was accomplished.\r\n\n          In  United States v. Serrano,  870 F.2d 1,  8 (1st Cir.\r                                                \r\n\n1989)  and Krulewitch  v.  United States,  336  U.S. 440,  443-44\r                                                  \r\n\n(1949) the  issue of  the duration of  a conspiracy arose  in the\r\n\ncontext  of whether  statements  should have  been admitted  into\r\n\nevidence against defendants under  the coconspirator exception to\r\n\nthe  hearsay   rule.    The  statements  in  question  were  held\r\n\ninadmissible because they  were made long  after the collapse  of\r\n\nthe conspiracy  in the case of  Serrano and after the  end of the\r                                                 \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nconspiracy, successful or not, in Krulewitch. \r                                                      \r\n\n          It  is  apparent that  these  cases  do not  support  a\r\n\nproposition that conspiracies  end because of impossibility  when\r\n\nthe conspirators  are continuing to actively  pursue the original\r\n\ncriminal goal.\r\n\nDenial of the Rule 29 Motion for Acquittal\r          Denial of the Rule 29 Motion for Acquittal\r\n\n          At trial the defendant's argument  in favor of his Rule\r\n\n29  motion  was  that the  evidence,  viewed  in  the light  most\r\n\nfavorable  to the  government, showed  only that  he was  doing a\r\n\nfavor for friends and  lacked criminal intent.  The  record makes\r\n\nit plain that there  was more than enough  evidence from which  a\r\n\nrational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt\r\n\nthat  the  Appellant  was  engaged  in  a  conspiracy  to  import\r\n\nmarijuana and had the active role  of supplying the boat and crew\r\n\nneeded to import the marijuana.  Having asserted specific grounds\r\n\nfor that motion, other grounds such as the impossibility argument\r\n\ndiscussed above cannot be raised on appeal.  See United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nDandy, 998 F.2d 1344, 1357 (6th Cir. 1993), cert. denied,  115 S.\r                                                                  \r\n\nCt. 1188 (1994).  In any event, that line of argument would be to\r\n\nno avail in light of the conclusion reached above that an unknown\r\n\nimpossibility does not end a conspiracy. \r\n\nDenial of a mistrial for prejudicial testimony\r          Denial of a mistrial for prejudicial testimony\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n          During  cross  examination  about  his  past  crimes  a\r\n\nprosecution witness,  Sergio Monteagudo, was asked  where a prior\r\n\ndrug  crime had  occurred.   He replied  \"Your client  can recall\r\n\nbecause  I gave him 1,000 dollars at that time.\"  Defendant moved\r\n\nfor a  mistrial.  The court denied the motion and gave a curative\r\n\ninstruction to the jury. \r\n\n          This  was  certainly an  inappropriate  and potentially\r\n\nprejudicial answer.  However, within the context of the events at\r\n\nthe trial  it was not likely to  affect the outcome and interfere\r\n\nwith the jury's ability to make an impartial determination of the\r\n\nfacts.  The factors leading to this  conclusion are those set out\r\n\nin United States v.  Manning, 23 F.3d  570, 574 (1st Cir.  1994),\r                                      \r\n\nthe severity of  the cause, the  surrounding context, the  likely\r\n\neffect  of  a  curative  instruction,  and  the strength  of  the\r\n\nevidence against the defendant.   In this case all  these factors\r\n\nmilitated  against  a  mistrial.   Although  the  summary of  the\r\n\noffensive  testimony above gives it a certain clarity, it was not\r\n\nas clear in the actual  sequence of testimony.  There  it appears\r\n\nthat counsel for defendant  was probing about a drug  crime prior\r\n\nto the one  on trial and could not  elicit an exact date  for it.\r\n\nThen  he  asked  \"where  did  this  happen?\"  and   the  response\r\n\nimplicating his client  was given.   Although the implication  is\r\n\nthat the payment to  defendant was connected to that  prior crime\r\n\nit  is   not  a  clear  or  graphic  description  of  defendant's\r\n\ninvolvement. \r\n\n          In any event, the trial judge immediately gave the jury\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\na thorough and forceful curative instruction.  There is no reason\r\n\nto believe that  this episode interfered with  the jury's ability\r\n\nto  reach an impartial verdict.  When this is considered together\r\n\nwith the strong evidence of appellant's guilt developed elsewhere\r\n\nat  trial it  is plain  that the  trial judge  did not  abuse her\r\n\ndiscretion in denying the motion for mistrial.\r\n\nAdmission  of hearsay  testimony as  to  location of  a telephone\r          Admission  of hearsay  testimony as  to  location of  a telephone\r\n\nnumber\r          number\r\n\n          The  government wanted to  connect Appellant, the owner\r\n\nof  El  Relincho  fish  market,  to  telephone  calls  made  from\r\n\ntelephone  number 863-3318 in Fajardo,  Puerto Rico, to the hotel\r\n\nin  St. Croix that  was being used  by the  conspirators who were\r\n\nsearching for the Colombian  boat.  To that end  Jos  A. Morales,\r\n\nthe  DEA case  agent  for  this case  was  asked  whether he  had\r\n\ndetermined the  number of El  Relincho fish market.   He gave the\r\n\nnumber 863-3318.  Later, on cross examination, it was brought out\r\n\nthat  in the telephone company records that number is listed only\r\n\nas being  invoiced to a Julia Amparo  G mez at a General Delivery\r\n\naddress in Puerto Rural, Puerto Rico.  On redirect examination no\r\n\nconnection was made between  that person and the Appellant  or El\r\n\nRelincho fish  market.   Over  a hearsay  objection, Morales  was\r\n\nallowed to testify that on two occasions he had called the number\r\n\nin question and had been told by  a person on the other end  that\r\n\nhe had reached El Relincho fish market. \r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          The  linking of  the telephone  number in  question and\r\n\nAppellant's fish market was  first made in testimony to  which no\r\n\nobjection  was made.   The  admission of  that testimony  was not\r\n\nplain  error.  The later  testimony, based on  what the agent was\r\n\ntold  when he dialed  that number,  was inadmissible  hearsay and\r\n\nshould not have been allowed in evidence.  The  admission of that\r\n\ntestimony  was  harmless  error.   In  neither  instance was  the\r\n\nevidence concerning  the telephone  number important in  light of\r\n\nthe abundance  of other  evidence linking  the Appellant  and his\r\n\nfishmarket to  the activity  of the conspiracy.

Secs. 952 and 963.  Appellant claims that it was error for the trial court to deny a motion for a bill of particulars, to deny a mistrial after prejudicial testimony, to allow hearsay testimony linking a telephone number used in the conspiracy to appellant's fish market, to deny his Rule 29 motion for acquittal, and finally, to increase his sentencing Guideline level for having a managerial role in the crime.  For the following reasons, Appellant's claims are found to be without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Denial of the Bill of Particulars</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant was named in Count One of the Indictment.  That count described a conspiracy that began on or about October 26, 1991 with the object of importing marijuana from Colombia and ended on November 6, 1991 when the conspirators found out that the boat for which they had been searching had been seized by Venezuelan authorities.  Appellant was described as joining the conspiracy on November 2, 1991, when, in a meeting at his fish store, he agreed to supply the boat and crew needed to meet the Colombian boat at a point ten to fifteen miles off the coast of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.  Count I of the indictment ends with an allegation that one of the conspirators made some calls on November 6, 1991, after which he announced to the others that the boat had been seized by Venezuelan authorities.  He then called St. Croix to have the others return to Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant claims that it was error for the District Court to deny his bill of particulars asking for the date on which the Colombian boat was seized by the Venezuelan authorities.  According to Appellant that information would have allowed him to present a defense that, for him, the crime of conspiracy to import marijuana had become impossible to achieve because the boat was seized prior to November 2, 1991, before he was alleged to have met with the other conspirators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Appellant, the anticipated delivery date of November 4th means that the boat had to leave Colombia four to five days earlier, in which case its seizure by Venezuelan authorities had to take place before appellant's first contact with the other conspirators at 5:00 P.M. on November 2d.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has defended the denial of the bill of particulars on the grounds that the indictment provided sufficient information, that the government did not have the seizure information, that it provided full discovery in any event, and that if the seizure did indeed take place prior to November 2d, the conspirators would most likely have found out about it quickly and would not have continued their efforts to meet the Colombian boat.  The government suggests that the seizure took place after the rendezvous failed.  The government also asserts that the defendant was not prejudiced by the lack of the information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin with, the denial of a bill of particulars is reversible error only if it is a clear abuse of discretion that causes actual prejudice to a defendant's substantial rights.  United States v. Hallock, 941 F.2d 36, 40 (1st Cir.1991).  This indictment contained more than enough information to allow defendant to prepare his defense.  In fact, it is prolix compared to the indictment under discussion in United States v. Paiva, 892 F.2d 148 (1st Cir.1989), which did not contain any precise time period for the conspiracy and did not even specify the date on which the defendant joined it.  Nevertheless this Court held that the temporal specifications of \"early 1983\" and \"the fall of 1983\" were sufficient to allow the preparation of a defense without a bill of particulars.  A fortiori the temporal details in this indictment were sufficient to allow the defendant to present a defense that the conspiracy had ended before he came into the picture.  It is noteworthy that the record shows no attempt by defendant to pursue alternative means of obtaining information about the date of the boat seizure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we go past the correctness of denying the elaboration of an adequate indictment, there is another insurmountable obstacle to the request for information about the date of seizure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denial of this bill of particulars as to the time and location of the seizure could not possibly be an abuse of discretion because it could not be the basis of a legal defense to the charge of conspiracy.  It has been held that \"... a culpable conspiracy may exist even though, because of the misapprehension of the conspirators as to certain facts, the substantive crime which is the object of the conspiracy may be impossible to commit.\"  United States v. Waldron, 590 F.2d 33, 34 (1st Cir.1979).  In that case the conspirators thought that they were working to import and sell valuable stolen paintings.  In reality, the only painting they delivered to Boston was a forgery worth less than the $5000 minimum of the provision making it unlawful to knowingly sell stolen goods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's argument resembles the one made by appellants in United States v. Giry, 818 F.2d 120 (1st Cir.1987) that because the persons who were to import the cocaine were agents of the Drug Enforcement Agency [DEA] the importation could never actually occur.  The court rejected \"... the faulty assumption that an expressed conspiratorial objective is negated by its factual impossibility.\"  818 F.2d at 126.   Here appellant joined in a conspiracy and performed an essential role in obtaining a boat and crew needed to accomplish the crime.  Even if intervening events had made the accomplishment of the criminal purpose impossible all the elements of a criminal conspiracy were present.  There is no basis for making a distinction between those who start a conspiracy that is impossible from the beginning and one who joins in a conspiracy that has become impossible due to intervening events unknown to the conspirators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant has cited three cases for the proposition that a conspiracy ends when its purpose is thwarted, United States v. Roshko, 969 F.2d 1, 8 (2d Cir.1992);  United States v. Serrano, 870 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1989);  and Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440, 443-44, 69 S.Ct. 716, 718-19, 93 L.Ed. 790 (1949).  This proposition can only be true if the conduct of the conspirators is no longer directed towards accomplishment of the goal of the conspiracy, impossible or not.  In the cases cited by appellant it was held that the conspiracy had ended either because its goal had been reached or because the conspirators had given up.  There was no continuation of acts designed to further the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Roshko, 969 F.2d 1, 8 (2d Cir.1992), appellant's conspiracy was held to have ended successfully when he obtained a green card by means of a sham marriage to a first \"wife.\"   The government, seeking to justify indicting him after the five year statute of limitations had run on that crime, had argued that the conspiracy continued through the later points in time when he divorced that first wife and married another woman.  The court held that it was the obtaining of a green card that was the object of the conspiracy and the conspiracy terminated when that was accomplished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Serrano, 870 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1989) and Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440, 443-44, 69 S.Ct. 716, 718-19, 93 L.Ed. 790 (1949) the issue of the duration of a conspiracy arose in the context of whether statements should have been admitted into evidence against defendants under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule.  The statements in question were held inadmissible because they were made long after the collapse of the conspiracy in the case of Serrano and after the end of the conspiracy, successful or not, in Krulewitch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apparent that these cases do not support a proposition that conspiracies end because of impossibility when the conspirators are continuing to actively pursue the original criminal goal.Denial of the Rule 29 Motion for Acquittal</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial the defendant's argument in favor of his Rule 29 motion was that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, showed only that he was doing a favor for friends and lacked criminal intent.  The record makes it plain that there was more than enough evidence from which a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the Appellant was engaged in a conspiracy to import marijuana and had the active role of supplying the boat and crew needed to import the marijuana.  Having asserted specific grounds for that motion, other grounds such as the impossibility argument discussed above cannot be raised on appeal.  See United States v. Dandy, 998 F.2d 1344, 1357 (6th Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1188, 127 L.Ed.2d 538 (1994).  In any event, that line of argument would be to no avail in light of the conclusion reached above that an unknown impossibility does not end a conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>Denial of a mistrial for prejudicial testimony</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During cross examination about his past crimes a prosecution witness, Sergio Monteagudo, was asked where a prior drug crime had occurred.  He replied \"Your client can recall because I gave him 1,000 dollars at that time.\"   Defendant moved for a mistrial.  The court denied the motion and gave a curative instruction to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was certainly an inappropriate and potentially prejudicial answer.  However, within the context of the events at the trial it was not likely to affect the outcome and interfere with the jury's ability to make an impartial determination of the facts.  The factors leading to this conclusion are those set out in United States v. Manning, 23 F.3d 570, 574 (1st Cir.1994), the severity of the cause, the surrounding context, the likely effect of a curative instruction, and the strength of the evidence against the defendant.  In this case all these factors militated against a mistrial.  Although the summary of the offensive testimony above gives it a certain clarity, it was not as clear in the actual sequence of testimony.  There it appears that counsel for defendant was probing about a drug crime prior to the one on trial and could not elicit an exact date for it.  Then he asked \"where did this happen?\" and the response implicating his client was given.  Although the implication is that the payment to defendant was connected to that prior crime it is not a clear or graphic description of defendant's involvement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the trial judge immediately gave the jury a thorough and forceful curative instruction.  There is no reason to believe that this episode interfered with the jury's ability to reach an impartial verdict.  When this is considered together with the strong evidence of appellant's guilt developed elsewhere at trial it is plain that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in denying the motion for mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Admission of hearsay testimony as to location of a telephone number</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government wanted to connect Appellant, the owner of El Relincho fish market, to telephone calls made from telephone number 863-3318 in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, to the hotel in St. Croix that was being used by the conspirators who were searching for the Colombian boat.  To that end Jose A. Morales, the DEA case agent for this case was asked whether he had determined the number of El Relincho fish market.  He gave the number 863-3318.  Later, on cross examination, it was brought out that in the telephone company records that number is listed only as being invoiced to a Julia Amparo Gomez at a General Delivery address in Puerto Rural, Puerto Rico.  On redirect examination no connection was made between that person and the Appellant or El Relincho fish market.  Over a hearsay objection, Morales was allowed to testify that on two occasions he had called the number in question and had been told by a person on the other end that he had reached El Relincho fish market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The linking of the telephone number in question and Appellant's fish market was first made in testimony to which no objection was made.  The admission of that testimony was not plain error.  The later testimony, based on what the agent was told when he dialed that number, was inadmissible hearsay and should not have been allowed in evidence.  The admission of that testimony was harmless error.  In neither instance was the evidence concerning the telephone number important in light of the abundance of other evidence linking the Appellant and his fishmarket to the activity of the conspiracy.  This is not an instance where the error would cause a \"miscarriage of justice\" or cause the \"fundamental fairness or basic integrity of the proceedings\" to be skewed in a major respect.  See United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 973 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>Imposition of an increase in Sentencing Guideline level</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that he came into the conspiracy at a late stage and did not have a true managerial role.  Accordingly, he asserts that it was error for the sentencing Judge to make an upward adjustment of 3 points in his guideline level.  Appellant argues that he should have received a 2 point decrease for being a minor participant in the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This contention has no merit.  There is no clear error in the sentencing judge's imposition of an increase for managerial participation.  The recruiting, supplying, and instructing of those who are to perform an essential mission of picking up marijuana at sea plainly indicates a managerial role.  It has been held that \" '[e]fforts to marshall other individuals for the purpose of executing the crime' are enough to demonstrate sufficient control over a participant for the purposes of Sec. 3B1.1.\"  United States v. Sax, 39 F.3d 1380 (7th Cir.1994) (quoting United States v. Carson, 9 F.3d 576, 585 (7th Cir.1993).  Accordingly, it was not erroneous for the sentencing judge to make an upward adjustment of 3 points under Sec. 3B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines.  See United States v.

Waldron, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"362477\"><a href=\"/opinion/362477/united-states-v-george-b-waldron/\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.1979).  In that case the conspirators thought that they were working to import and sell valuable stolen paintings.  In reality, the only painting they delivered to Boston was a forgery worth less than the $5000 minimum of the provision making it unlawful to knowingly sell stolen goods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's argument resembles the one made by appellants in United States v.

Here appellant joined in a conspiracy and performed an essential role in obtaining a boat and crew needed to accomplish the crime.  Even if intervening events had made the accomplishment of the criminal purpose impossible all the elements of a criminal conspiracy were present.  There is no basis for making a distinction between those who start a conspiracy that is impossible from the beginning and one who joins in a conspiracy that has become impossible due to intervening events unknown to the conspirators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant has cited three cases for the proposition that a conspiracy ends when its purpose is thwarted, United States v.

This proposition can only be true if the conduct of the conspirators is no longer directed towards accomplishment of the goal of the conspiracy, impossible or not.  In the cases cited by appellant it was held that the conspiracy had ended either because its goal had been reached or because the conspirators had given up.  There was no continuation of acts designed to further the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v.

The court held that it was the obtaining of a green card that was the object of the conspiracy and the conspiracy terminated when that was accomplished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v.

The statements in question were held inadmissible because they were made long after the collapse of the conspiracy in the case of Serrano and after the end of the conspiracy, successful or not, in Krulewitch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apparent that these cases do not support a proposition that conspiracies end because of impossibility when the conspirators are continuing to actively pursue the original criminal goal.Denial of the Rule 29 Motion for Acquittal</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial the defendant's argument in favor of his Rule 29 motion was that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, showed only that he was doing a favor for friends and lacked criminal intent.  The record makes it plain that there was more than enough evidence from which a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the Appellant was engaged in a conspiracy to import marijuana and had the active role of supplying the boat and crew needed to import the marijuana.  Having asserted specific grounds for that motion, other grounds such as the impossibility argument discussed above cannot be raised on appeal.  See United States v. Dandy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611583\"><a href=\"/opinion/611583/united-states-v-alex-dandy/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1344</span></a></span>, 1357 (6th Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span> </span>(1994).  In any event, that line of argument would be to no avail in light of the conclusion reached above that an unknown impossibility does not end a conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>Denial of a mistrial for prejudicial testimony</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During cross examination about his past crimes a prosecution witness, Sergio Monteagudo, was asked where a prior drug crime had occurred.  He replied \"Your client can recall because I gave him 1,000 dollars at that time.\"   Defendant moved for a mistrial.  The court denied the motion and gave a curative instruction to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was certainly an inappropriate and potentially prejudicial answer.  However, within the context of the events at the trial it was not likely to affect the outcome and interfere with the jury's ability to make an impartial determination of the facts.  The factors leading to this conclusion are those set out in United States v. Manning, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195356\"><a href=\"/opinion/195356/united-states-v-manning/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span>, 574 (1st Cir.1994), the severity of the cause, the surrounding context, the likely effect of a curative instruction, and the strength of the evidence against the defendant.  In this case all these factors militated against a mistrial.  Although the summary of the offensive testimony above gives it a certain clarity, it was not as clear in the actual sequence of testimony.  There it appears that counsel for defendant was probing about a drug crime prior to the one on trial and could not elicit an exact date for it.  Then he asked \"where did this happen?\" and the response implicating his client was given.  Although the implication is that the payment to defendant was connected to that prior crime it is not a clear or graphic description of defendant's involvement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the trial judge immediately gave the jury a thorough and forceful curative instruction.  There is no reason to believe that this episode interfered with the jury's ability to reach an impartial verdict.  When this is considered together with the strong evidence of appellant's guilt developed elsewhere at trial it is plain that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in denying the motion for mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Admission of hearsay testimony as to location of a telephone number</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government wanted to connect Appellant, the owner of El Relincho fish market, to telephone calls made from telephone number 863-3318 in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, to the hotel in St. Croix that was being used by the conspirators who were searching for the Colombian boat.  To that end Jose A. Morales, the DEA case agent for this case was asked whether he had determined the number of El Relincho fish market.  He gave the number 863-3318.  Later, on cross examination, it was brought out that in the telephone company records that number is listed only as being invoiced to a Julia Amparo Gomez at a General Delivery address in Puerto Rural, Puerto Rico.  On redirect examination no connection was made between that person and the Appellant or El Relincho fish market.  Over a hearsay objection, Morales was allowed to testify that on two occasions he had called the number in question and had been told by a person on the other end that he had reached El Relincho fish market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The linking of the telephone number in question and Appellant's fish market was first made in testimony to which no objection was made.  The admission of that testimony was not plain error.  The later testimony, based on what the agent was told when he dialed that number, was inadmissible hearsay and should not have been allowed in evidence.  The admission of that testimony was harmless error.  In neither instance was the evidence concerning the telephone number important in light of the abundance of other evidence linking the Appellant and his fishmarket to the activity of the conspiracy.  This is not an instance where the error would cause a \"miscarriage of justice\" or cause the \"fundamental fairness or basic integrity of the proceedings\" to be skewed in a major respect.  See United States v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 973 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>Imposition of an increase in Sentencing Guideline level</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that he came into the conspiracy at a late stage and did not have a true managerial role.  Accordingly, he asserts that it was error for the sentencing Judge to make an upward adjustment of 3 points in his guideline level.  Appellant argues that he should have received a 2 point decrease for being a minor participant in the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This contention has no merit.  There is no clear error in the sentencing judge's imposition of an increase for managerial participation.  The recruiting, supplying, and instructing of those who are to perform an essential mission of picking up marijuana at sea plainly indicates a managerial role.  It has been held that \" '[e]fforts to marshall other individuals for the purpose of executing the crime' are enough to demonstrate sufficient control over a participant for the purposes of Sec. 3B1.1.\"  United States v.
