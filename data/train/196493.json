After Israel Pi eiro-Sanchez  (or \"claim-\r                              \r\n\nant\") was  denied an administrative  hearing to review  a partial\r\n\ndenial of Social Security disability benefits, the district court\r\n\nheld that the hearing  denial did not constitute a  \"final\" deci-\r\n\nsion for purposes  of 42 U.S.C.   405(g),1 and  that it therefore\r\n\nlacked subject  matter jurisdiction to review the decision of the\r\n\nSocial Security  Administration (\"SSA\").  Claimant  appealed.  We\r\n\nnow reverse and remand for further administrative proceedings.\r\n\n          In a Notice of  Award dated February 26, 1992,  the SSA\r\n\ndetermined that claimant was entitled to benefits from a disabil-\r\n\nity onset date subsequent to that originally alleged by claimant,\r\n\nand  it reduced the requested  award accordingly.   The Notice of\r\n\nAward informed  the claimant:  \"You have  60 days  to ask for  an\r\n\nappeal.   The 60 days start  the day after you  receive this let-\r\n\nter.\"   The critical factual  dispute in the  case is whether the\r\n\nclaimant filed a timely  appeal from this decision.   The resolu-\r\n\ntion of the dispute  turns on when claimant received  the Notice,\r\n\nand when he requested a hearing.\r\n\n          Claimant's  counsel,  Juan  Hernandez Rivera,  Esquire,\r\n\n(\"Hernandez\"),  avers that he did  not receive the  Notice in San\r\n\nJuan, Puerto Rico,  until March 9, 1992    12  days after the SSA\r\n\nmailed it  from Baltimore, Maryland.2   Hernandez further asserts\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Section  405(g) provides  that \"any  final decision  of the\r\nSecretary made after  a hearing\" is judicially  reviewable in the\r\ndistrict court.  42 U.S.C.A.   405(g) (West 1991 &amp; Supp. 1995).\r\n\n     2There is no indication  as to when, if ever,  claimant him-\r\nself received the Notice.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nthat he requested a hearing on behalf of the claimant in a letter\r\n\ndated April 28, 1992.   On the other hand, the Secretary contends\r\n\nthat the  deadline  for filing  an  appeal was  May 1,  and  that\r\n\nclaimant missed the  deadline because his hearing request was not\r\n\nreceived in the district office in Manati, Puerto Rico, until May\r\n\n7.   Consequently, in September 1992, an administrative law judge\r\n\n(\"ALJ\") sent a  letter to Hernandez  inquiring whether there  was\r\n\n\"good cause\" to excuse  the late filing.  In  response, Hernandez\r\n\nexplained that he had not received the Notice until March  9, and\r\n\nthat he had requested a hearing within 60 days thereafter.  \r\n\n          Ultimately, the ALJ issued  an order of dismissal after\r\n\ndetermining that  claimant had failed  to show  \"good cause\"  for\r\n\nfailing to file the  hearing request on time.   Specifically, the\r\n\nALJ found that: (1) counsel's representation that he had received\r\n\nthe  Notice on  March 9  was not  credible because  mail normally\r                                                                           \r\n\ntakes no more than five days to reach Puerto Rico from Baltimore;\r\n\nand (2) counsel  probably posted  the hearing request  on May  5,\r                                   \r\n\nrather  than April 28, since  the district office  received it on\r                                                                           \r\n\nMay  7.3   The ALJ  thereupon dismissed  the appeal  as untimely.\r                \r\n\nClaimant then  sought review by  the Appeals Council,  which con-\r\n\ncluded  that SSA  regulations  afford no  basis for  reviewing an\r\n\nALJ's discretionary dismissal.  See infra note 5. \r                                                   \r\n\n          District court  dismissals for  lack of  subject matter\r\n\njurisdiction are reviewed de novo.  Torres v. Secretary of Health\r                                                                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3In contrast to the affidavit the Secretary submitted to the\r\ndistrict  court, the order of dismissal lists May 3 as the filing\r\ndeadline.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nand Human Services, 845 F.2d 1136, 1137 n.1 (1st Cir. 1988).  The\r                            \r\n\nparties cite to a number of inapposite authorities addressing the\r\n\ndiscretionary power to  deny requests  for deadline  extensions.4\r                                                                         \r\n\nHere,  however, the  question is  whether the  claimant's hearing\r\n\nrequest  was filed  on time  in the  first instance.   If  so, we\r                                                             \r\n\ncannot doubt  that he has  been denied his  statutory right  to a\r\n\nhearing.5  Absent controlling authority to  the contrary, we find\r\n\nthat  the district court had jurisdiction under section 405(g) to\r\n\nreview  the  agency decision  denying  claimant's  request for  a\r\n\nhearing in the first  instance.  See Matsibekker v.  Heckler, 738\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 79, 81-82 (2d Cir. 1984). \r\n\n          The  ALJ proceeded  on  the assumption  that claimant's\r\n\nrequest  for hearing in the  first instance was  late, then asked\r\n\nclaimant to  demonstrate \"good  cause\" for missing  the deadline.\r\n\nThe  district court  implicitly indulged  the same  assumption in\r\n\ndismissing  the  complaint.   On the  other  hand, the  record on\r\n\nappeal includes a date-stamped copy of the back of  the Notice of\r\n\nAward,  which  claimant   contends  demonstrates  that  Hernandez\r\n\nreceived the Notice on March 9, 1992.  The mail supervisor at the\r\n\nHernandez  law  firm submitted  an  affidavit corroborating  this\r\n\nposition  as well.    The Secretary  countered with  an affidavit\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4See 20 C.F.R.    416.1403(8) (1995) (a denial of  a request\r                   \r\nto extend  the time for filing an appeal is not reviewable by the\r                   \r\n\"Appeals Council\" or by the courts).  \r\n\n     542 U.S.C.A.    405(b)(1) (West  1991 &amp; Supp.  1995)   (pro-\r\nviding  \"reasonable  notice and  opportunity  for  a hearing\"  to\r\nreview  adverse decisions);  see also  20 C.F.R.    404.909(a)(1)\r                                               \r\n(1995)  (describing procedure  for requesting  reconsideration of\r\ninitial determination).\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nsubstantially incorporating the ALJ's \"findings.\"  \r\n\n          On this record, the ALJ's determination that the appeal\r\n\nwas  untimely filed was unreasonable and cannot stand.  We there-\r\n\nfore remand to the ALJ for further proceedings.  If the SSA seeks\r\n\na hearing to offer  evidence that, despite the clear  implication\r\n\nof the  evidence before us, including the date stamp and the mail\r\n\nclerk's affidavit, the  appeal was  not timely filed,  we do  not\r\n\nrule out  such a hearing.6   However, the SSA may,  in the inter-\r\n\nests of  efficiency, wish  to avoid waste  of time and  effort by\r\n\nforegoing such a hearing;  in this event, the ALJ  should proceed\r\n\nto the merits of claimant's appeal.\r\n\n          The  judgment of the district  court is vacated and the\r                                                                           \r\n\ncase is remanded to the Secretary for further proceedings consis-\r                                                                           \r\n\ntent with this opinion.\r                                \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6We note, however, that in addition to the evidence that the\r\nNotice of Award was received on March  9, 1992, the claimant also\r\nproduced credible evidence  that he requested a  hearing on April\r\n28, that is, within the deadline urged by the Secretary.  The ALJ\r                             \r\nappeared to believe that  a hearing request is deemed  filed when\r\nthe  district office  receives it;  this was  error.

Moreover, the Secretary adverts to no evidence as to\r\nthe  processing of hearing requests in  the district office, such\r\nas  might rule out the possibility of delay in preparing the dis-\r\ntrict office form that reflects May 7 as the date of receipt.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n",

Claimant appealed.   We now reverse and remand for further administrative proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a Notice of Award dated February 26, 1992, the SSA determined that claimant was entitled to benefits from a disability onset date subsequent to that originally alleged by claimant, and it reduced the requested award accordingly.   The Notice of Award informed the claimant:  \"You have 60 days to ask for an appeal.   The 60 days start the day after you receive this letter.\"   The critical factual dispute in the case is whether the claimant filed a timely appeal from this decision.   The resolution of the dispute turns on when claimant received the Notice, and when he requested a hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant's counsel, Juan Hernandez Rivera, Esquire, (\"Hernandez\"), avers that he did not receive the Notice in San Juan, Puerto Rico, until March 9, 1992 12 days after the SSA mailed it from Baltimore, Maryland.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Hernandez further asserts that he requested a hearing on behalf of the claimant in a letter dated April 28, 1992.   On the other hand, the Secretary contends that the deadline for filing an appeal was May 1, and that claimant missed the deadline because his hearing request was not received in the district office in Manati, Puerto Rico, until May 7. Consequently, in September 1992, an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") sent a letter to Hernandez inquiring whether there was \"good cause\" to excuse the late filing.   In response, Hernandez explained that he had not received the Notice until March 9, and that he had requested a hearing within 60 days thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, the ALJ issued an order of dismissal after determining that claimant had failed to show \"good cause\" for failing to file the hearing request on time.   Specifically, the ALJ found that:  (1) counsel's representation that he had received the Notice on March 9 was not credible because mail normally takes no more than five days to reach Puerto Rico from Baltimore;  and (2) counsel probably posted the hearing request on May 5, rather than April 28, since the district office received it on May 7.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The ALJ thereupon dismissed the appeal as untimely.   Claimant then sought review by the Appeals Council, which concluded that SSA regulations afford no basis for reviewing an ALJ's discretionary dismissal.

The parties cite to a number of inapposite authorities addressing the discretionary power to deny requests for deadline extensions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Here, however, the question is whether the claimant's hearing request was filed on time in the first instance.   If so, we cannot doubt that he has been denied his statutory right to a hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Absent controlling authority to the contrary, we find that the district court had jurisdiction under section 405(g) to review the agency decision denying claimant's request for a hearing in the first instance.

The district court implicitly indulged the same assumption in dismissing the complaint.   On the other hand, the record on appeal includes a date-stamped copy of the back of the Notice of Award, which claimant contends demonstrates that Hernandez received the Notice on March 9, 1992.   The mail supervisor at the Hernandez law firm submitted an affidavit corroborating this position as well.
