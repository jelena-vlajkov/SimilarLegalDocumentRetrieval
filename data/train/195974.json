Defendant-appellant  Jaime  Valencia pled\r                            \n\nguilty  to  conspiracy  to  possess cocaine  with  intent  to\n\ndistribute it.   See  21 U.S.C.    846.   The  district court\r                                \n\nsentenced appellant to 188  months imprisonment followed by a\n\nperiod of supervised release.   Valencia now appeals, arguing\n\nthat the district court erred in increasing his offense level\n\nunder U.S.S.G.   3C1.1  for obstruction of justice.   For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     Valencia  was arrested  on August  31, 1991  following a\n\ngovernment \"sting\" operation.  On September 3, 1991, prior to\n\nhis initial appearance before  a magistrate judge, a pretrial\n\nservices officer interviewed him for the purpose of making  a\n\nrecommendation about his pretrial release.  Valencia provided\n\nfalse   identifying   information   during  this   interview,\n\nincluding the false  name \"Juan Jose Restrepo.\"  The pretrial\n\nservices  officer  prepared a  report  which  stated that  \"a\n\nrecord  check  reveals no  criminal  history.\"   The  report,\n\nhowever,   recommended  that   Valencia,   referred   to   as\n\n\"Restrepo,\"  be detained on  the grounds that  he presented a\n\nrisk of flight and danger to the community.\n\n     At the  initial appearance,  the government moved  for a\n\ndetention hearing  under 18 U.S.C.    3142(f).   This hearing\n\nwas  held before the magistrate judge  on September 11, 1991.\n\nWhen asked to spell  his name, Valencia, who was  under oath,\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nresponded,  \"R-E-S-T-R-E-P-O.\"   Counsel for  Valencia cross-\n\nexamined the government's sole witness, Special Agent Russell\n\nProtentis.    At  the  conclusion of  the  hearing,  Valencia\n\nconsented to the  entry of an  order of detention,  reserving\n\nhis right to produce  conditions of release at a  later time.\n\nOn  February 7, 1992, an FBI  investigation revealed his true\n\nidentity,  as well as  the fact that  he was a  fugitive from\n\ndrug and firearm charges in New York.\n\n     Valencia pled  guilty on April 8, 1993.  His presentence\n\ninvestigative report  recommended a two  level increase under\n\nU.S.S.G.    3C1.1 for  obstruction of justice.   A sentencing\n\nhearing was conducted, and  sentence was imposed, on November\n\n9, 1993.  The district  court found that at least  two events\n\nmade an  upward adjustment  under    3C1.1 appropriate.   The\n\nfirst  event  was  Valencia's  identification of  himself  as\n\n\"Restrepo\"  in  his  interview  with  the  pretrial  services\n\nofficer.  The  second event  was his giving  the false  name,\n\nunder  oath, at  the  outset of  the  detention hearing  when\n\n\"detention was still an open issue.\"\n\n                             II.\n\n     Pursuant to   3C1.1, the sentencing court shall increase\n\nthe  offense  level  by  two \"[i]f  the  defendant  willfully\n\nobstructed or  impeded, or  attempted to obstruct  or impede,\n\nthe  administration  of  justice  during  the  investigation,\n\nprosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense.\"  One type\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nof  conduct to  which this  enhancement applies  is providing\n\n\"materially  false  information to  a  .  .  .   magistrate.\"\n\nU.S.S.G.     3C1.1, comment.  n.  3(f).   An  obstruction  of\n\njustice increase is also  warranted when a defendant provides\n\nmaterially false information to  a pretrial services  officer\n\nwho  is conducting a bail  investigation for the  court.  See\r                                                                         \n\nUnited States v. St. James, 38 F.3d 987, 988 (8th Cir.  1994)\r                                      \n\n(observing that commentary  note 3(h) describes very  similar\n\nconduct).  A material statement  is a \"statement . . .  that,\n\nif  believed,  would tend  to influence  or affect  the issue\n\nunder determination.\"  U.S.S.G.   3C1.1, comment. n. 5.\n\n     Valencia argues that his false identification of himself\n\nas  \"Restrepo\"  to  the  pretrial services  officer  did  not\n\nwarrant  an enhancement  under    3C1.1.   In particular,  he\n\ncontends that the  officer's investigation  was not  impeded,\n\nand  could  not  be  impeded,  since  a  routine  fingerprint\n\nanalysis  performed by  the FBI  revealed his  true identity.\n\nThis  argument  is  misplaced.    Although  materially  false\n\nstatements made  to law enforcement officials  do not warrant\n\nan  enhancement  unless  they  \"significantly  obstructed  or\n\nimpeded  the official  investigation  or  prosecution of  the\n\ninstant offense,\" see  U.S.S.G.   3C1.1  n.3(g), the same  is\r                                 \n\nnot  true of  materially false  statements made  to probation\n\nofficers  and, by  analogy,  pretrial services  officers,  in\n\nrespect to  an investigation  for the  court, see U.S.S.G.   \r                                                             \n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n3C1.1, comment. n. 3(h);  United States v. St. Cyr,  977 F.2d\r                                                              \n\n698, 705 &amp; n.6 (1st Cir. 1992).  Accordingly, no showing that\n\npretrial services' investigation was significantly obstructed\n\nwas required.1\n\n     We add that Valencia's true identity was material to the\n\nofficer's  investigation, even  if the  false information  he\n\nprovided    did   not   ultimately   affect   the   officer's\n\nrecommendation.   His  deliberate misrepresentation  had  the\n\npotential to do so.  No  more is required.  Cf. United States\r                                                                         \n\nv. Harrison, 42 F.3d  427, 430 (7th Cir. 1994)  (holding that\r                       \n\nwhether the magistrate judge ultimately relied on defendant's\n\nfalse statement in ordering his  detention is not relevant to\n\nthe  application  of  the   enhancement);  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \n\nMafanya,  24   F.3d  412,  415  (2d   Cir.  1994)  (affirming\r                   \n\nenhancement  where defendant  appeared before  the magistrate\n\njudge using a  false identity even  though his true  identity\n\nwas discovered before the detention hearing).\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  We note that Valencia's  true identity was not discovered\nuntil  some   months  after  the  pretrial  services  officer\nprepared  his  report  and  made his  recommendation  to  the\nmagistrate judge.   Because  Valencia provided a  false name,\nthe officer's  report contained inaccurate  information about\nhis criminal history.  Such reports must  be prepared quickly\nand, in  any event, prior to  the detention hearing.   See 18\r                                                                      \nU.S.C.    3154  (requiring the  pretrial services  officer to\ncollect,  verify, and  report information  pertaining  to the\npretrial  release  of  a  defendant \"prior  to  the  pretrial\nrelease hearing.\")   Under the circumstances,  although we do\nnot rely upon it, we think that Valencia's deception actually\nimpeded the officer in the performance of his task.\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n     In sum, we conclude  that Valencia's false statements to\n\nthe pretrial services officer justified the enhancement under\n\n   3C1.1.   Under the  circumstances, we  need not  reach the\n\nissue whether his identification  of himself as \"Restrepo\" at\n\nthe  detention  hearing  could constitute  an  obstruction of\n\njustice in light of  the fact that he assented  to detention.\n\nAccordingly, the  judgment below  is affirmed.   See Loc.  R.\r                                                                \n\n27.1.\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n",

A sentencing hearing was conducted, and sentence was imposed, on November 9, 1993.  The district court found that at least two events made an upward adjustment under Sec. 3C1.1 appropriate.  The first event was Valencia's identification of himself as \"Restrepo\" in his interview with the pretrial services officer.  The second event was his giving the false name, under oath, at the outset of the detention hearing when \"detention was still an open issue.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to Sec. 3C1.1, the sentencing court shall increase the offense level by two \"[i]f the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense.\"   One type of conduct to which this enhancement applies is providing \"materially false information to a ... magistrate.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1, comment. n. 3(f).  An obstruction of justice increase is also warranted when a defendant provides materially false information to a pretrial services officer who is conducting a bail investigation for the court.  See United States v. St. James, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"681048\"><a href=\"/opinion/681048/united-states-v-stephen-craig-st-james-also-known-as-stephen-craig-nance/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span>, 988 (8th Cir.1994) (observing that commentary note 3(h) describes very similar conduct).  A material statement is a \"statement ... that, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1, comment. n. 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valencia argues that his false identification of himself as \"Restrepo\" to the pretrial services officer did not warrant an enhancement under Sec. 3C1.1.  In particular, he contends that the officer's investigation was not impeded, and could not be impeded, since a routine fingerprint analysis performed by the FBI revealed his true identity.  This argument is misplaced.  Although materially false statements made to law enforcement officials do not warrant an enhancement unless they \"significantly obstructed or impeded the official investigation or prosecution of the instant offense,\" see U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1 n. 3(g), the same is not true of materially false statements made to probation officers and, by analogy, pretrial services officers, in respect to an investigation for the court, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1, comment. n. 3(h);  United States v. St. Cyr, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593172\"><a href=\"/opinion/593172/united-states-v-john-l-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 705 &amp; n. 6 (1st Cir.1992).  Accordingly, no showing that pretrial services' investigation was significantly obstructed was required.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that Valencia's true identity was material to the officer's investigation, even if the false information he provided did not ultimately affect the officer's recommendation.  His deliberate misrepresentation had the potential to do so.  No more is required.  Cf. United States v. Harrison, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684114\"><a href=\"/opinion/684114/united-states-v-jeffrey-w-harrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span>, 430 (7th Cir.1994) (holding that whether the magistrate judge ultimately relied on defendant's false statement in ordering his detention is not relevant to the application of the enhancement);  United States v. Mafanya, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670492\"><a href=\"/opinion/670492/united-states-v-abel-mafanya/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span>, 415 (2d Cir.1994) (affirming enhancement where defendant appeared before the magistrate judge using a false identity even though his true identity was discovered before the detention hearing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that Valencia's false statements to the pretrial services officer justified the enhancement under Sec. 3C1.1.  Under the circumstances, we need not reach the issue whether his identification of himself as \"Restrepo\" at the detention hearing could constitute an obstruction of justice in light of the fact that he assented to detention.  Accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed.  See Loc.R. 27.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We note that Valencia's true identity was not discovered until some months after the pretrial services officer prepared his report and made his recommendation to the magistrate judge.  Because Valencia provided a false name, the officer's report contained inaccurate information about his criminal history.  Such reports must be prepared quickly and, in any event, prior to the detention hearing.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3154 (requiring the pretrial services officer to collect, verify, and report information pertaining to the pretrial release of a defendant \"prior to the pretrial release hearing.\")   Under the circumstances, although we do not rely upon it, we think that Valencia's deception actually impeded the officer in the performance of his task</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
