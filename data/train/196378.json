Plaintiff has sold its  hoof\r\n\npads  under  the  trademark  \"EQUINE  TECHNOLOGIES\"1 since  1989.\r\n\nPlaintiff also sells a  hoof cleanser called CLEAN TRAX  which is\r\n\nalso  sold under the EQUINE  TECHNOLOGIES mark.  Plaintiff's mark\r\n\nhas been registered  on the  Primary Register of  the Patent  and\r\n\nTrademark Office (\"PTO\") since March 1993.\r\n\n          Defendant, a Florida  corporation, began marketing  and\r\n\nselling hoof  care products using the  mark \"EQUITECHNOLOGIES\" in\r\n\n1993.   In its promotion  efforts, defendant has  stated that the\r\n\n\"shock absorption qualities\" of  its product make it \"ideal  as a\r\n\ncustom   hoof   pad.\"     Defendant's   petition  for   trademark\r\n\nregistration was preliminarily rejected by the PTO on the grounds\r\n\nthat  it  was confusingly  similar  to  the  mark  registered  by\r\n\nplaintiff.  Notwithstanding the ruling of the  PTO, defendant has\r\n\ncontinued to  append the  official trademark registration  to its\r\n\nmark.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  The \"u\" in EQUINE is in the form of a horseshoe.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          Plaintiff sued defendant in  the United States District\r\n\nCourt  for Massachusetts  alleging  federal and  state claims  of\r\n\ntrademark infringement  and unfair  competition, and moved  for a\r\n\npreliminary injunction  to enjoin  defendant from using  the mark\r\n\nEquitechnologies  during  the  pendency  of  the  lawsuit.

The central issue in  this case, as with\r\n\nmost preliminary injunction trademark  cases, see id., is whether\r                                                              \r\n\nplaintiff demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          Defendant's first contention is that the district court\r\n\nerred  in  finding  a likelihood  of  success  on  the merits  of\r\n\nplaintiff's  claims  because the  mark  \"EQUINE  TECHNOLOGIES\" is\r\n\n\"merely  descriptive\"   of  the  horse  hoof   pads  produced  by\r\n\nplaintiff,  and therefore invalid.   See  15 U.S.C.    1052(e)(1)\r                                                  \r\n\n(proscribing registration of merely descriptive marks).  While we\r\n\nthink plaintiff's mark is  \"suggestive\" of its product,  we agree\r\n\nwith  the district court that the mark EQUINE TECHNOLOGIES is not\r\n\n\"merely descriptive\" of hoof pads for horses.2\r\n\n          \"A  term  is  suggestive  if it  requires  imagination,\r\n\nthought and perception to reach a conclusion  as to the nature of\r\n\ngoods.   A  term  is  descriptive  if  it  forthwith  conveys  an\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  We have explained the significance of  the classification of a\r\nmark as either \"descriptive\" or \"suggestive.\"\r\n\n            A court's  inquiry  into whether  a  term\r\n            merits  trademark protection  starts with\r\n            the classification of that term along the\r\n            spectrum  of  \"distinctiveness.\"   At one\r\n            end  of  the spectrum  there  are generic\r\n            terms that have  passed into common usage\r\n            to  identify a product,  such as aspirin,\r\n            and  can  never  be  protected.    In the\r\n            middle  there  are so-called  descriptive\r\n            terms, such as a geographical term, which\r\n            can  be  protected, but  only  if  it has\r\n            acquired a \"secondary  meaning\" by  which\r\n            consumers associate it with  a particular\r\n            product or  source.  At the  other end of\r\n            the   spectrum,  there   are  suggestive,\r\n            arbitrary and fanciful terms that  can be\r\n            protected  without   proof  of  secondary\r\n            meaning.

Moreover,\r                                           \r\n\nbecause  plaintiff's mark has been  registered by the  PTO on the\r\n\nPrincipal Register,  it is  entitled to  a  legal presumption  of\r\n\nvalidity.    See 15  U.S.C.    1115(a)  (registration of  mark on\r                          \r\n\nPrincipal Register \"shall be prima facie evidence of the validity\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nof the registered mark . . . and of the registrant's right to use\r\n\nthe  registered mark  in commerce  on or  in connection  with the\r\n\ngoods  or  services  specified  in the  certificate\").    Section\r\n\n1115(a)  entitles  the  plaintiff   to  a  presumption  that  its\r\n\nregistered  trademark is  inherently  distinctive, as  opposed to\r\n\nmerely  descriptive.  See Quabaug Rubber Co. v.

Defendant's argument boils down\r\n\nto its contention  that \"[a]  consumer (i.e.,  farrier or  equine\r\n\nveterinarian)  would  naturally expect  a  company  called EQUINE\r\n\nTECHNOLOGIES to make high-tech  hoof pads for horses.\"   Like the\r\n\ndistrict court, we  find this argument  unsupported by case  law,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3  Defendant argues that plaintiff's mark is somehow not entitled\r\nto  this presumption  because plaintiff's  first  application for\r\ntrademark protection was rejected.  Defendant seems to ignore the\r\nfact that plaintiff,  as it was entitled, amended its application\r\nand its mark was subsequently placed on the registry  by the PTO.\r\nPlaintiff's mark  is therefore fully entitled  to the presumption\r\nof validity.     \r\n\n4  When registering  its mark with the PTO,  plaintiff disclaimed\r\nany  exclusive  rights  to  the  term  \"EQUINE\"  because  of  its\r\ndescriptive  nature.     As   plaintiff  correctly   points  out,\r\ntrademarks may properly incorporate  descriptive terms for a non-\r\ndescriptive whole.    \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nand lacking in basic common sense.\r\n\n          The district court concluded:\r\n\n               Plaintiff is likely  to prevail on its\r\n            claim   that  the  mark   is  not  merely\r\n            descriptive    because   it    does   not\r\n            immediately conjure up the thought of the\r\n            subject  goods.  Simply  hearing the name\r\n            gives  virtually no  idea of  the product\r\n            except that  it has  to  do with  horses.\r\n            Seeing the mark provides a better clue as\r\n            it transforms the  \"u\" into a  horseshoe.\r\n            However,  the  viewing public  still does\r\n            not  know  if  the product  is  itself  a\r\n            horseshoe, or a horseshoe related product\r\n            like a  hoof pad, or if  the enlarged \"u\"\r\n            is  simply a  graphic technique  to evoke\r\n            the idea of horses.\r\n\n          The  court's  finding  of  non-descriptiveness  is  not\r\n\nclearly  erroneous.     The  term   \"Equine  Technologies\"  might\r\n\nreasonably be thought  to suggest  that the product  to which  it\r\n\napplies has  to do with horses.  The addition of the upturned \"u\"\r\n\nmight  also suggest, to the  perceptive consumer, that  it has do\r                             \r\n\nwith  hooves  or  horseshoes.

The  mark  itself  does not  convey  information  about\r\n\nplaintiff's  product  or  its   intended  consumers;  rather,  it\r\n\nrequires imagination to connect the term \"Equine Technologies\" to\r\n\nhoof care products, in general, and to the plaintiff's product in\r\n\nparticular.  We  find no  error in the  district court's  holding\r\n\nthat plaintiff's mark was not merely descriptive of its product.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n          Before moving on to defendant's argument concerning the\r\n\nlikelihood of confusion  between the two marks,  we pause briefly\r\n\nto address defendant's contention that the district court applied\r\n\nthe wrong  legal standard  in analyzing the  \"merely descriptive\"\r\n\nquestion.     Defendant   maintains   that  the   district  court\r\n\nincorrectly  analyzed  only  the  question of  whether  the  mark\r\n\nimmediately   describes   the  actual   product,   and  therefore\r\n\nimplicitly  rejected the concept  that a trademark  may be merely\r\n\ndescriptive if it describes the intended purpose, function or use\r\n\nof  the goods,  the class  of  user of  the  goods, or  desirable\r\n\ncharacteristics  of the goods.  See 1 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and\r                                             \r\n\nUnfair  Competition,     11.5  (1994).    The  problem with  this\r\n\nargument is  that defendant  consistently argued to  the district\r\n\ncourt  that plaintiff's  mark  was invalid  precisely because  it\r\n\nmerely described plaintiff's product; i.e., hoof pads for horses.\r\n\nThe  district  court  was  therefore  responding  to  defendant's\r\n\nspecific  contention.    Defendant   is  not  entitled  to  raise\r\n\narguments on appeal  that it  failed to present  to the  district\r\n\ncourt.  See Boston Beer, 9 F.3d at 180 (\"a  litigant's failure to\r                                 \r\n\nexplicitly raise  an issue  before the district  court forecloses\r\n\nthat party from  raising the issue for the first time on appeal\")\r\n\n(citing McCoy v.  Massachusetts Inst. of Technology, 950 F.2d 13,\r                                                             \r\n\n22 (1st  Cir. 1981), cert. denied,  112 S. Ct. 1939  (1992)).  We\r                                           \r\n\ntherefore treat these new arguments as waived.  See id. at 181.\r                                                                \r\n\n          Defendant's  second contention  is  that  the  district\r\n\ncourt  erred in finding a likelihood of confusion between the two\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nmarks.   \"Once the  determination has been  made that  a term  is\r\n\nentitled  to trademark  protection, the  pivotal inquiry  becomes\r\n\nwhether the allegedly infringing mark is likely to cause consumer\r\n\nconfusion.\"  Boston Beer, 9 F.3d at 180.  See 15 U.S.C.   1114(1)\r                                                       \r\n\n(prohibiting  the  use  of  a  mark  that  is  \"likely  to  cause\r\n\nconfusion,  or  to  cause mistake,  or  to  deceive\").   In  this\r\n\ncircuit, this determination  is based upon  an analysis of  eight\r\n\nseparate  factors,  each  of   which  requires  its  own  factual\r\n\nfindings.  See, e.g.,  Aktiebolaget Electrolux v. Armatron Int'l,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc., 999 F.2d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir. 1993); DeCosta, 981  F.2d at 606;\r                                                        \r\n\nKeds Corp., 888 F.2d at  222.  The determination as to  whether a\r                    \r\n\nlikelihood  of confusion exists is  a question of  fact, which we\r\n\nreview only for clear error.  See Aktiebolaget, 999 F.2d at 3.\r                                                        \r\n\n          The  findings made by  the district court  in this case\r\n\nare summarized below:\r\n\n          1) Similarity of  Marks:  The  impressions made on  the\r\n\near and the mind by  the two marks are quite close,  although, to\r\n\nthe eye, the  two marks are not  so close.   Based on the  \"total\r\n\neffect\" of the  marks, the  similarity between the  two marks  is\r\n\nstrong.\r\n\n          2) Similarity  of Goods:   Both products belong  to the\r\n\nnarrow category of  hoof care  products.  Even  assuming a  price\r\n\ndifferential  between the  products, the  similarity between  the\r\n\ngoods  is  strong.    Moreover,  even  assuming  that  the  prime\r\n\npurchasers  of   the   goods  are   sophisticated  farriers   and\r\n\nveterinarians, the goods are similar enough to create confusion.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          3,4,5)  Channels of  Trade, Advertising,  and Class  of\r\n\nProspective Purchasers:5   The parties present  their products at\r\n\nthe same trade shows, and advertise in the same magazines, to the\r\n\nsame target groups of consumers.\r\n\n          6) Evidence  of Actual Confusion:   Plaintiff made more\r\n\nthan  a  minimal  showing  of actual  confusion,  citing  several\r\n\ninstances of  consumer and promotional confusion  between the two\r\n\ncompanies and their products.\r\n\n          7) Defendant's Intent in Adopting the Mark:  The record\r\n\nis  inadequate  to make  a  finding with  respect  to defendant's\r\n\nintent in adopting the mark.\r\n\n          8)  Strength of the Mark:  Defendant failed to overcome\r\n\nthe   presumption  of  validity  attached  to  registered  marks.\r\n\nPlaintiff's mark is moderately strong.\r\n\n          The district  court meticulously  analyzed each  of the\r\n\neight  factors,  and  it is  only  with  respect  to the  court's\r\n\nanalysis of  the last  factor that the  defendant asserts  error.\r\n\nDefendant  contends  that the  district  court  erred in  finding\r\n\nplaintiff's mark  to be moderately strong, and  asserts that this\r\n\nerroneous finding  fatally infects  the  court's conclusion  that\r\n\nthere is a likelihood of confusion between the two products.\r\n\n          We reject this  argument for two  reasons.  First,  the\r\n\nstrength of a mark is  but one of eight factors to  be considered\r\n\nin  analyzing the likelihood of confusion issue.  See Keds Corp.,\r                                                                          \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5 As  is the custom in this  circuit, the district court analyzed\r\nthese  factors together.   See  Aktiebolaget, 999  F.2d at  3 n.3\r                                                      \r\n(collecting cases).\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n888 F.2d at 222 (\"No one factor is necessarily determinative, but\r\n\neach must be considered.\") (citing  Volkswagen AG v. Wheeler, 814\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  812, 817 (1st Cir. 1987)).  The district court's subsidiary\r\n\nfindings that  six  of  the seven  other  factors  demonstrate  a\r\n\nlikelihood of confusion -- the intent factor being inconclusive -\r\n\n- are  sufficient to sustain the court's ultimate conclusion that\r\n\nsuch confusion exists.\r\n\n          Second,   the   district   court's    conclusion   that\r\n\nplaintiff's mark was moderately  strong is not clearly erroneous.\r\n\nIn determining  a trademark's  relative strength, this  court has\r\n\nexamined  \"the  length of  time  a  mark has  been  used  and the\r\n\nrelative  renown  in  its field;  the  strength  of  the mark  in\r\n\nplaintiff's  field of  business;  and the  plaintiff's action  in\r\n\npromoting the mark.\"  Keds Corp., 888 F.2d at 222 (quoting Boston\r                                                                           \r\n\nAthletic Ass'n v. Sullivan, 867 F.2d 22, 32 (1st Cir. 1989)).  In\r                                    \r\n\nthis  case,  the district  court noted  the following  factors in\r\n\nsupport of  its conclusion: (1) the mark has been in use for four\r\n\nyears; (2)  plaintiff has actively  marketed goods with  the mark\r\n\naffixed, including  74 print advertisements  promoting the  mark;\r\n\n(3)  plaintiff  has received  favorable  publicity  in the  horse\r\n\nworld; (4)  plaintiff has  successfully compelled one  infringing\r\n\ncompetitor to change  its name; and (5)  the PTO has rejected  at\r\n\nleast one attempt  by a  competitor to register  a similar  name.\r\n\nMoreover, the  plaintiff's mark has  been registered by  the PTO,\r\n\nwhich provides additional support for the court's conclusion that\r\n\nthe mark  is moderately strong.   See DeCosta,  981 F.2d at  606.\r                                                       \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nThese findings, which defendant  has not challenged as erroneous,\r\n\nsufficiently support the court's conclusion that plaintiff's mark\r\n\nis moderately strong.\r\n\n          Finally,  defendant contends that \"the Court completely\r\n\nignored the relevance of the fact that numerous companies in this\r\n\nindustry  use a  combination  of Equi,  Equine,  Eque, Eques  and\r\n\n'Technology.'\"   This  assertion is  belied by  the record.   The\r\n\ndistrict court  opinion expressly  cites each of  these examples,\r\n\nbut notes that only one of those companies directly competes with\r\n\nplaintiff,  and concludes  that  \"its  mark  is not  as  similar,\r\n\nvisually or  aurally, as  defendants' trademark.\"   Defendant has\r\n\nnot argued that this factual finding is clearly erroneous.\r\n\n          We have considered  all of defendant's  other arguments\r\n\nand find them without merit.  The district  court opinion in this\r\n\ncase is detailed and comprehensive.  The court carefully reviewed\r\n\nthe evidence, made specific findings of  fact which are supported\r\n\nby  the record, and resolved the question of injunctive relief in\r\n\naccordance with  the proper legal  standard.  The  district court\r\n\ncorrectly  found that  it  was  likely  that consumers  would  be\r\n\nconfused by the two marks, and that plaintiff is therefore likely\r\n\nto succeed on  the merits of its  infringement claim.   The court\r\n\nalso  correctly  ruled that  the  other factors  relevant  to the\r\n\nissuance  of   a  preliminary   injunction  weighed   heavily  in\r\n\nplaintiff's  favor.  We find no basis for disturbing the district\r\n\ncourt decision.\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\n          For  the reasons  stated  herein, the  judgment of  the\r\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.

Plaintiff has sold its hoof pads under the trademark \"EQUINE TECHNOLOGIES\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> since 1989.  Plaintiff also sells a hoof cleanser called CLEAN TRAX which is also sold under the EQUINE TECHNOLOGIES mark.

A district court may grant a preliminary injunction in a trademark case when it concludes that the plaintiff has demonstrated (1) that it will suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted;  (2) that any such injury outweighs any harm which granting the injunction would cause the defendant;  (3) a likelihood of success on the merits;  and (4) that the public interest will not be adversely affected by the granting of the injunction.  Keds Corp. v. Renee Int'l Trading Corp., 888 F.2d 215, 220 (1989) (citing Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts v. Bellotti, 641 F.2d 1006, 1009 (1st Cir.1981)).  The central issue in this case, as with most preliminary injunction trademark cases, see id., is whether plaintiff demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's first contention is that the district court erred in finding a likelihood of success on the merits of plaintiff's claims because the mark \"EQUINE TECHNOLOGIES\" is \"merely descriptive\" of the horse hoof pads produced by plaintiff, and therefore invalid.  See 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1052(e)(1) (proscribing registration of merely descriptive marks).  While we think plaintiff's mark is \"suggestive\" of its product, we agree with the district court that the mark EQUINE TECHNOLOGIES is not \"merely descriptive\" of hoof pads for horses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A term is suggestive if it requires imagination, thought and perception to reach a conclusion as to the nature of goods.

See also Union Nat'l Bank of Texas (Laredo) v. Union Nat'l Bank of Texas (Austin), 909 F.2d 839, 844 (5th Cir.1990).  Merely descriptive terms generally are not entitled to protection under trademark law \"both because they are a poor means of distinguishing one source of services from another and because they are often necessary to the description of all goods or services of a similar nature.\"  A.J.

Vess Beverages, Inc., 796 F.2d 903, 906 (7th Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether a particular mark is merely descriptive of a product, a reviewing court must consider the mark in its entirety, with a view toward \"what the purchasing public would think when confronted with the mark as a whole.\"  In re Hutchinson Technology Inc., 852 F.2d 552, 552-54 (Fed.Cir.1988).  The district court's determination that plaintiff's mark is not merely descriptive of its product is a finding of fact which we review only for clear error.  Boston Beer Co. v. Slesar Bros. Brewing Co., 9 F.3d 175, 180 (1st Cir.1993).  The clear error hurdle is \"quite high.\"  Id. (citation omitted).  Moreover, because plaintiff's mark has been registered by the PTO on the Principal Register, it is entitled to a legal presumption of validity.  See 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1115(a) (registration of mark on Principal Register \"shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark ... and of the registrant's right to use the registered mark in commerce on or in connection with the goods or services specified in the certificate\").  Section 1115(a) entitles the plaintiff to a presumption that its registered trademark is inherently distinctive, as opposed to merely descriptive.  See Quabaug Rubber Co. v. Fabiano Shoe Co., 567 F.2d 154, 161 (1st Cir.1977) (federal registration \"is prima facie evidence that such mark has become distinctive of the goods in commerce\");  Liquid Controls Corp. v. Liquid Control Corp., 802 F.2d 934, 936 (7th Cir.1986).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  That said, we turn to the facts at issue in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no dispute in this case that the term \"equine\" is descriptive of horses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The question, however, is whether the mark, in its entirety, is merely descriptive of plaintiff's product--hoof pads for horses.  Defendant's argument boils down to its contention that \"[a] consumer (i.e., farrier or equine veterinarian) would naturally expect a company called EQUINE TECHNOLOGIES to make high-tech hoof pads for horses.\"   Like the district court, we find this argument unsupported by case law, and lacking in basic common sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff is likely to prevail on its claim that the mark is not merely descriptive because it does not immediately conjure up the thought of the subject goods.  Simply hearing the name gives virtually no idea of the product except that it has to do with horses.  Seeing the mark provides a better clue as it transforms the \"u\" into a horseshoe.  However, the viewing public still does not know if the product is itself a horseshoe, or a horseshoe related product like a hoof pad, or if the enlarged \"u\" is simply a graphic technique to evoke the idea of horses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's finding of non-descriptiveness is not clearly erroneous.  The term \"Equine Technologies\" might reasonably be thought to suggest that the product to which it applies has to do with horses.  The addition of the upturned \"u\" might also suggest, to the perceptive consumer, that it has do with hooves or horseshoes.  But we think the mark clearly \"requires the consumer to exercise the imagination in order to draw a conclusion as to the nature of goods and services.\"  Union Nat'l Bank, 909 F.2d 839, 844 (5th Cir.1990) (quoting Zatarains, Inc. v. Oak Grove Smokehouse, Inc., 698 F.2d 786, 790 (5th Cir.1983)).  The mark itself does not convey information about plaintiff's product or its intended consumers;  rather, it requires imagination to connect the term \"Equine Technologies\" to hoof care products, in general, and to the plaintiff's product in particular.  We find no error in the district court's holding that plaintiff's mark was not merely descriptive of its product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before moving on to defendant's argument concerning the likelihood of confusion between the two marks, we pause briefly to address defendant's contention that the district court applied the wrong legal standard in analyzing the \"merely descriptive\" question.  Defendant maintains that the district court incorrectly analyzed only the question of whether the mark immediately describes the actual product, and therefore implicitly rejected the concept that a trademark may be merely descriptive if it describes the intended purpose, function or use of the goods, the class of user of the goods, or desirable characteristics of the goods.  See 1 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition, Sec. 11.5 (1994).  The problem with this argument is that defendant consistently argued to the district court that plaintiff's mark was invalid precisely because it merely described plaintiff's product;  i.e., hoof pads for horses.  The district court was therefore responding to defendant's specific contention.  Defendant is not entitled to raise arguments on appeal that it failed to present to the district court.  See Boston Beer, 9 F.3d at 180 (\"a litigant's failure to explicitly raise an issue before the district court forecloses that party from raising the issue for the first time on appeal\") (citing McCoy v. Massachusetts Inst. of Technology, 950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir.1981), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 910, 112 S.Ct. 1939, 118 L.Ed.2d 545 (1992)).  We therefore treat these new arguments as waived.  See id. at 181.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's second contention is that the district court erred in finding a likelihood of confusion between the two marks.  \"Once the determination has been made that a term is entitled to trademark protection, the pivotal inquiry becomes whether the allegedly infringing mark is likely to cause consumer confusion.\"  Boston Beer, 9 F.3d at 180.   See 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1114(1) (prohibiting the use of a mark that is \"likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive\").  In this circuit, this determination is based upon an analysis of eight separate factors, each of which requires its own factual findings.  See, e.g., Aktiebolaget Electrolux v. Armatron Int'l, Inc., 999 F.2d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir.1993);  DeCosta, 981 F.2d at 606;  Keds Corp., 888 F.2d at 222.   The determination as to whether a likelihood of confusion exists is a question of fact, which we review only for clear error.  See Aktiebolaget, 999 F.2d at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The findings made by the district court in this case are summarized below:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1) Similarity of Marks:  The impressions made on the ear and the mind by the two marks are quite close, although, to the eye, the two marks are not so close.  Based on the \"total effect\" of the marks, the similarity between the two marks is strong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2) Similarity of Goods:  Both products belong to the narrow category of hoof care products.  Even assuming a price differential between the products, the similarity between the goods is strong.  Moreover, even assuming that the prime purchasers of the goods are sophisticated farriers and veterinarians, the goods are similar enough to create confusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3, 4, 5) Channels of Trade, Advertising, and Class of Prospective Purchasers:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The parties present their products at the same trade shows, and advertise in the same magazines, to the same target groups of consumers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6) Evidence of Actual Confusion:  Plaintiff made more than a minimal showing of actual confusion, citing several instances of consumer and promotional confusion between the two companies and their products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7) Defendant's Intent in Adopting the Mark:  The record is inadequate to make a finding with respect to defendant's intent in adopting the mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8) Strength of the Mark:  Defendant failed to overcome the presumption of validity attached to registered marks.  Plaintiff's mark is moderately strong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court meticulously analyzed each of the eight factors, and it is only with respect to the court's analysis of the last factor that the defendant asserts error.  Defendant contends that the district court erred in finding plaintiff's mark to be moderately strong, and asserts that this erroneous finding fatally infects the court's conclusion that there is a likelihood of confusion between the two products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this argument for two reasons.  First, the strength of a mark is but one of eight factors to be considered in analyzing the likelihood of confusion issue.  See Keds Corp., 888 F.2d at 222 (\"No one factor is necessarily determinative, but each must be considered.\")  (citing Volkswagenwerk AG v. Wheeler, 814 F.2d 812, 817 (1st Cir.1987)).  The district court's subsidiary findings that six of the seven other factors demonstrate a likelihood of confusion--the intent factor being inconclusive--are sufficient to sustain the court's ultimate conclusion that such confusion exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the district court's conclusion that plaintiff's mark was moderately strong is not clearly erroneous.  In determining a trademark's relative strength, this court has examined \"the length of time a mark has been used and the relative renown in its field;  the strength of the mark in plaintiff's field of business;  and the plaintiff's action in promoting the mark.\"  Keds Corp., 888 F.2d at 222 (quoting Boston Athletic Ass'n v. Sullivan, 867 F.2d 22, 32 (1st Cir.1989)).  In this case, the district court noted the following factors in support of its conclusion:  (1) the mark has been in use for four years;  (2) plaintiff has actively marketed goods with the mark affixed, including 74 print advertisements promoting the mark;  (3) plaintiff has received favorable publicity in the horse world;  (4) plaintiff has successfully compelled one infringing competitor to change its name;  and (5) the PTO has rejected at least one attempt by a competitor to register a similar name.  Moreover, the plaintiff's mark has been registered by the PTO, which provides additional support for the court's conclusion that the mark is moderately strong.  See DeCosta, 981 F.2d at 606.   These findings, which defendant has not challenged as erroneous, sufficiently support the court's conclusion that plaintiff's mark is moderately strong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defendant contends that \"the Court completely ignored the relevance of the fact that numerous companies in this industry use a combination of Equi, Equine, Eque, Eques and 'Technology.' \"   This assertion is belied by the record.  The district court opinion expressly cites each of these examples, but notes that only one of those companies directly competes with plaintiff, and concludes that \"its mark is not as similar, visually or aurally, as defendants' trademark.\"   Defendant has not argued that this factual finding is clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered all of defendant's other arguments and find them without merit.  The district court opinion in this case is detailed and comprehensive.  The court carefully reviewed the evidence, made specific findings of fact which are supported by the record, and resolved the question of injunctive relief in accordance with the proper legal standard.  The district court correctly found that it was likely that consumers would be confused by the two marks, and that plaintiff is therefore likely to succeed on the merits of its infringement claim.  The court also correctly ruled that the other factors relevant to the issuance of a preliminary injunction weighed heavily in plaintiff's favor.  We find no basis for disturbing the district court decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.

In the middle there are so-called descriptive terms, such as a geographical term, which can be protected, but only if it has acquired a \"secondary meaning\" by which consumers associate it with a particular product or source.  At the other end of the spectrum, there are suggestive, arbitrary and fanciful terms that can be protected without proof of secondary meaning.  These terms are considered \"inherently distinctive.\"</p>\n        <p>Boston Beer Co. v. Slesar Bros.

Plaintiff also sells a hoof cleanser called CLEAN TRAX which is also sold under the EQUINE TECHNOLOGIES mark.

Section 1115(a) entitles the plaintiff to a presumption that its registered trademark is inherently distinctive, as opposed to merely descriptive.  See Quabaug Rubber Co. v.

Defendant's argument boils down to its contention that \"[a] consumer (i.e., farrier or equine veterinarian) would naturally expect a company called EQUINE TECHNOLOGIES to make high-tech hoof pads for horses.\"   Like the district court, we find this argument unsupported by case law, and lacking in basic common sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff is likely to prevail on its claim that the mark is not merely descriptive because it does not immediately conjure up the thought of the subject goods.  Simply hearing the name gives virtually no idea of the product except that it has to do with horses.  Seeing the mark provides a better clue as it transforms the \"u\" into a horseshoe.  However, the viewing public still does not know if the product is itself a horseshoe, or a horseshoe related product like a hoof pad, or if the enlarged \"u\" is simply a graphic technique to evoke the idea of horses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's finding of non-descriptiveness is not clearly erroneous.  The term \"Equine Technologies\" might reasonably be thought to suggest that the product to which it applies has to do with horses.  The addition of the upturned \"u\" might also suggest, to the perceptive consumer, that it has do with hooves or horseshoes.  But we think the mark clearly \"requires the consumer to exercise the imagination in order to draw a conclusion as to the nature of goods and services.\"  Union Nat'l Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545512\"><a href=\"/opinion/545512/union-national-bank-of-texas-laredo-texas-v-union-national-bank-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></a></span>, 844 (5th Cir.1990) (quoting Zatarains, Inc. v.

The mark itself does not convey information about plaintiff's product or its intended consumers;  rather, it requires imagination to connect the term \"Equine Technologies\" to hoof care products, in general, and to the plaintiff's product in particular.

Defendant maintains that the district court incorrectly analyzed only the question of whether the mark immediately describes the actual product, and therefore implicitly rejected the concept that a trademark may be merely descriptive if it describes the intended purpose, function or use of the goods, the class of user of the goods, or desirable characteristics of the goods.  See 1 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition, Sec. 11.5 (1994).  The problem with this argument is that defendant consistently argued to the district court that plaintiff's mark was invalid precisely because it merely described plaintiff's product;  i.e., hoof pads for horses.  The district court was therefore responding to defendant's specific contention.  Defendant is not entitled to raise arguments on appeal that it failed to present to the district court.

See 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1114(1) (prohibiting the use of a mark that is \"likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive\").  In this circuit, this determination is based upon an analysis of eight separate factors, each of which requires its own factual findings.  See, e.g., Aktiebolaget Electrolux v.

The determination as to whether a likelihood of confusion exists is a question of fact, which we review only for clear error.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611604\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Aktiebolaget,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/611604/aktiebolaget-electrolux-v-armatron-international-inc-aktiebolaget/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The findings made by the district court in this case are summarized below:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1) Similarity of Marks:  The impressions made on the ear and the mind by the two marks are quite close, although, to the eye, the two marks are not so close.  Based on the \"total effect\" of the marks, the similarity between the two marks is strong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2) Similarity of Goods:  Both products belong to the narrow category of hoof care products.  Even assuming a price differential between the products, the similarity between the goods is strong.  Moreover, even assuming that the prime purchasers of the goods are sophisticated farriers and veterinarians, the goods are similar enough to create confusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3, 4, 5) Channels of Trade, Advertising, and Class of Prospective Purchasers:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The parties present their products at the same trade shows, and advertise in the same magazines, to the same target groups of consumers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6) Evidence of Actual Confusion:  Plaintiff made more than a minimal showing of actual confusion, citing several instances of consumer and promotional confusion between the two companies and their products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7) Defendant's Intent in Adopting the Mark:  The record is inadequate to make a finding with respect to defendant's intent in adopting the mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8) Strength of the Mark:  Defendant failed to overcome the presumption of validity attached to registered marks.  Plaintiff's mark is moderately strong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court meticulously analyzed each of the eight factors, and it is only with respect to the court's analysis of the last factor that the defendant asserts error.  Defendant contends that the district court erred in finding plaintiff's mark to be moderately strong, and asserts that this erroneous finding fatally infects the court's conclusion that there is a likelihood of confusion between the two products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this argument for two reasons.  First, the strength of a mark is but one of eight factors to be considered in analyzing the likelihood of confusion issue.  See Keds <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531209\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Corp.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/531209/the-keds-corp-v-renee-international-trading-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">222</span> </a></span>(\"No one factor is necessarily determinative, but each must be considered.\")  (citing Volkswagenwerk AG v. Wheeler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"485241\"><a href=\"/opinion/485241/volkswagenwerk-aktiengesellschaft-v-kenneth-g-wheeler/\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span>, 817 (1st Cir.1987)).  The district court's subsidiary findings that six of the seven other factors demonstrate a likelihood of confusion--the intent factor being inconclusive--are sufficient to sustain the court's ultimate conclusion that such confusion exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the district court's conclusion that plaintiff's mark was moderately strong is not clearly erroneous.  In determining a trademark's relative strength, this court has examined \"the length of time a mark has been used and the relative renown in its field;  the strength of the mark in plaintiff's field of business;  and the plaintiff's action in promoting the mark.\"  Keds <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531209\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Corp.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/531209/the-keds-corp-v-renee-international-trading-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">222</span> </a></span>(quoting Boston Athletic Ass'n v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518087\"><a href=\"/opinion/518087/boston-athletic-association-v-mark-sullivan-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.1989)).  In this case, the district court noted the following factors in support of its conclusion:  (1) the mark has been in use for four years;  (2) plaintiff has actively marketed goods with the mark affixed, including 74 print advertisements promoting the mark;  (3) plaintiff has received favorable publicity in the horse world;  (4) plaintiff has successfully compelled one infringing competitor to change its name;  and (5) the PTO has rejected at least one attempt by a competitor to register a similar name.  Moreover, the plaintiff's mark has been registered by the PTO, which provides additional support for the court's conclusion that the mark is moderately strong.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596487\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">DeCosta,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/596487/victor-decosta-v-viacom-international-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">606</span></a></span>.   These findings, which defendant has not challenged as erroneous, sufficiently support the court's conclusion that plaintiff's mark is moderately strong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defendant contends that \"the Court completely ignored the relevance of the fact that numerous companies in this industry use a combination of Equi, Equine, Eque, Eques and 'Technology.' \"   This assertion is belied by the record.  The district court opinion expressly cites each of these examples, but notes that only one of those companies directly competes with plaintiff, and concludes that \"its mark is not as similar, visually or aurally, as defendants' trademark.\"   Defendant has not argued that this factual finding is clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered all of defendant's other arguments and find them without merit.  The district court opinion in this case is detailed and comprehensive.  The court carefully reviewed the evidence, made specific findings of fact which are supported by the record, and resolved the question of injunctive relief in accordance with the proper legal standard.  The district court correctly found that it was likely that consumers would be confused by the two marks, and that plaintiff is therefore likely to succeed on the merits of its infringement claim.  The court also correctly ruled that the other factors relevant to the issuance of a preliminary injunction weighed heavily in plaintiff's favor.  We find no basis for disturbing the district court decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.

In the middle there are so-called descriptive terms, such as a geographical term, which can be protected, but only if it has acquired a \"secondary meaning\" by which consumers associate it with a particular product or source.  At the other end of the spectrum, there are suggestive, arbitrary and fanciful terms that can be protected without proof of secondary meaning.  These terms are considered \"inherently distinctive.\"</p>\n        <p>Boston Beer Co. v. Slesar Bros.
