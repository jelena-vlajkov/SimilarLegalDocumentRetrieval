(\"Webb Place\") and\n\nGreystone Condominiums, Inc.  (\"Greystone\") initiated this action\n\nin Massachusetts  state court against the  Federal Deposit Insur-\n\nance  Corporation (\"FDIC\"),  receiver  of 1st  American Bank  for\n\nSavings  (\"Bank\"),  seeking   declaratory  and  equitable  relief\n\nrelating to  two real estate loan  agreements between plaintiffs-\n\nappellants  and the Bank.   Following removal,  the United States\n\nDistrict Court  for the  District of Massachusetts  dismissed the\n\naction  on  jurisdictional  grounds  pursuant  to  the  Financial\n\nInstitutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (\"FIRREA\"), 12\n\nU.S.C.   1821(d)(13)(D) (1994).  We affirm.\n\n                                I\r                                          I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \n\n          In January 1988, Simon,  president and sole stockholder\n\nof Greystone and Webb Place (collectively:  \"Borrowers\"), entered\n\ninto  two mortgage loan  agreements with the  Bank, whereby Grey-\n\nstone  borrowed $2,500,000  and Webb  Place borrowed  a total  of\n\n$3,150,000  with which  to  finance condominium  development pro-\n\njects.  The loans were secured by mortgages on the  properties to\n\nbe developed and by Simon's personal guaranty.  \n\n          When the loans matured on January 31, 1990, the Borrow-\n\ners sought  extensions and further advances  to enable completion\n\nof  the projects.  On August 14,  1990, with the outstanding loan\n\nbalances at $2,500,000  on the Greystone  loan and $2,295,490  on\n\nthe Webb Place loan, the Borrowers entered into two separate Loan\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nModification Agreements (\"Modification Agreements\"),  whereby the\n\nBank  waived all  accrued  and future  interest  on the  original\n\nJanuary 1988 loans and  extended their maturity dates to  May 31,\n\n1992.   The Bank further agreed to lend an additional $816,000 to\n\nGreystone  and $520,942 to Webb  Place, to be  disbursed upon the\n\nBorrowers' request, for completion of the projects.  Finally, the\n\nBank agreed to provide end-loan financing to individual buyers of\n\nthe completed condominium units.\n\n          The Borrowers  in turn agreed to  complete construction\n\nof the mortgaged properties under the supervision of an  indepen-\n\ndent engineer, to devise a marketing plan acceptable to the Bank,\n\nand to pay the Bank 100% of the net proceeds from the sale of any\n\nunit  in the mortgaged properties in return for a partial release\n\nof the Bank's mortgage  lien.  Simon secured his  loan guaranties\n\nwith two certificates of  deposit and with mortgages on  two real\n\nestate properties  owned by him.   In return, the Bank  agreed to\n\nlimit Simon's total  liability on the personal guaranty  to $900-\n\n,000.\n\n          All  construction  loan requisitions  by  the Borrowers\n\nwere honored in  due course by  the Bank until October  18, 1990,\n\nwhen a  requisition for $204,657  was dishonored.   The following\n\nday, the Bank closed and FDIC was appointed receiver.\n\n          On October 24, FDIC published notice of its appointment\n\nas receiver,  alerting creditors that all claims against the Bank\n\nwere  to be submitted  to FDIC by January  23, 1991 (\"bar date\").\n\nOn October 25,  FDIC mailed  notice to all  known Bank  creditors\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nand, on  October 31, notice of FDIC's  appointment as liquidating\n\nagent of the Bank was  mailed to plaintiffs-appellants.  Although\n\nplaintiffs-appellants did not  receive FDIC's  notice, they  were\n\naware prior to the bar date that FDIC had been appointed receiver\n\nof the Bank.\n\n          On  October  31,  plaintiffs-appellants requested  that\n\nFDIC advise as to its position  respecting further loan disburse-\n\nments under the Modification Agreements.  FDIC did not reply.  On\n\nNovember 27,  plaintiffs-appellants informed  FDIC that  the Bank\n\nwas  in default  under the  Modification Agreements  for refusing\n\ntheir October  18 requisition.   Their  letter demanded  that the\n\nBorrowers' requisitions  be met and that  the collateral securing\n\nSimon's personal guaranty  be released due to the Bank's default.\n\nFDIC did not reply.\n\n          The present  action was commenced on April 21, 1992, in\n\nstate court.   Simon sued  to recover all  collateral pledged  to\n\nsecure  his personal guaranty and for a judicial declaration that\n\nhis personal obligations under the guaranty had been extinguished\n\nas a result of the Bank's and FDIC's defaults under the Modifica-\n\ntion  Agreements.   The Borrowers  sought a  judicial declaration\n\nentitling  them to a \"priority position\"  among Bank creditors on\n\nall obligations incurred  by the Borrowers to third parties after\n\nFDIC took possession of the Bank's assets.\n\n          After removal, the  federal district court granted  the\n\nFDIC  motion for summary judgment.   It found  that neither Simon\n\nnor the Borrowers  had filed  proofs of claim  with FDIC  despite\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nhaving received actual notice of FDIC's appointment.  Plaintiffs-\n\nappellants  thus having  failed to  exhaust their  administrative\n\nremedies, the district court ruled that their claims  were barred\n\nunder 12 U.S.C.   1821(d)(13)(D)(i).\n\n                                II\r                                          II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \n\n          Summary  judgment  rulings  are  reviewed  de  novo  to\r                                                                       \n\ndetermine whether the \"'pleadings, depositions, answers to inter-\n\nrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits,\n\nif any,  show that there is  no genuine issue as  to any material\n\nfact  and that  the moving  party is  entitled  to judgment  as a\n\nmatter of law.'\"  Gaskell v.

The Simon Guaranty\r                                 \n\n          Simon contends that FDIC  surrendered all claims to the\n\ncollateral pledged  to secure  his personal guaranty  because the\n\nBank's (and FDIC's subsequent)  breach of the Modification Agree-\n\nments discharged Simon from all liability.\n\n          Section 1821(d)(13)(D)(i)  bars all claims  against the\n\nassets  of  a failed  financial institution  which have  not been\n\npresented  under  the  administrative  claims  review  process (-\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n\"ACRP\"), see  12 U.S.C.   1821(d)(3)-(10), governing  the filing,\r                      \n\ndetermination, and payment of claims against the assets of failed\n\nfinancial institutions following  FDIC's appointment as receiver.\n\nHeno v.  FDIC, 20 F.3d 1204,  1206-07 (1st Cir. 1994).   Upon its\r                       \n\nappointment as receiver, FDIC is required to  publish notice that\n\nthe failed  institution's creditors must file claims with FDIC by\n\na specified  date not  less than  ninety days after  the date  of\n\npublication.  12 U.S.C.    1821(d)(3)(B).  FDIC is  also required\n\nto  mail notice to all known creditors of the failed institution.\n\nId.   1821(d)(3)(C).  It has 180 days from the date  of filing to\r             \n\nallow or  disallow claims.   Id.    1821(d)(5)(A)(i).   Claimants\r                                          \n\nhave  sixty days  from  the date  of  disallowance, or  from  the\n\nexpiration  of  the  180-day  administrative  decision  deadline,\n\nwithin  which to seek  judicial review  in an  appropriate United\n\nStates district court.   Id.   1821(d)(6)(A).  Failure  to comply\r                                      \n\nwith the ACRP deprives the courts  of subject matter jurisdiction\n\nover any  claim to  assets of the  failed financial  institution.\n\nSee id.   1821(d)(13)(D)(i).\r                 \n\n          Simon argues  that the instant claim for  the return of\n\nall collateral securing  his personal guaranty is  not subject to\n\nthe ACRP because  it is not a creditor's claim against the Bank's\n\nassets  but merely a defense to the contingent loan guaranty held\n\nby the Bank.  Cf. In re Purcell, 141 B.R. 480, 485 (Bankr. D. Vt.\r                                         \n\n1992), aff'd, 150  B.R. 111 (D. Vt. 1993).   But see Deera Homes,\r                                                                           \n\nInc. v. Metrobank for Sav., FSB, 812 F.  Supp. 375, 377-78 (E.D.-\r                                         \n\nN.Y.  1993).  As  Simon sees it,  therefore, he is  entitled to a\n\n                                6\r\r\n\njudgment declaring that the Modification Agreements were breached\n\nby the  Bank and,  consequently, his  personal guaranty  is unen-\n\nforceable and the collateral pledged to secure it must be surren-\n\ndered. \n\n          Throughout  the litigation,  Simon has  maintained that\n\nthe Bank  breached the Modification Agreements the day before the\r                                                                       \n\nBank  closed,  by refusing  to  honor the  Borrowers'  October 18\n\nconstruction  loan requisition.   At  oral argument,  he conceded\n\nthat  the personal guaranty was  no longer executory  by the time\n\nFDIC  became receiver  on October  19, 1990.   Cf.  infra Section\r                                                                   \n\nII.B.    Similarly, his  claim  to  the collateral  securing  the\n\npersonal  guaranty  consistently has  been  based  on the  Bank's\n\nOctober  18 breach  of  the Modification  Agreements.   Moreover,\n\nSimon's  November 27 letter to  FDIC demanded both  that the Bank\r                                                            \n\nrelease the  collateral securing  his personal guaranty  and that\r                                                                      \n\nthe Bank honor the Borrowers' requisitions from October 18.  \n\n          Thus,  Simon's position is and always has been that the\n\nBank's  pre-receivership refusal to  honor the Borrowers' October\r                     \n\n18 loan requisition constituted a material breach of the  Modifi-\n\ncation Agreements, entitling  him to recover his  collateral.  It\n\nis clear,  therefore, that the  claim to the  collateral securing\n\nthe personal guaranty is barred as a \"claim or action for payment\n\nfrom .  . .  the assets\" of  a failed  financial institution  for\n\nwhich  FDIC has  been  appointed  receiver.    See  12  U.S.C.   \r                                                            \n\n1821(d)(13)(D)(i).  \n\n          Simon  concedes  that  the  two  real  estate mortgages\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nsecuring his personal guaranty are bank \"assets.\"  Claims for the\n\nrecovery of  bank assets  are barred  absent compliance  with the\n\nACRP.  Id.  Simon was  aware of FDIC's appointment as receiver on\r                    \n\nOctober  19, 1990, well before  the ACRP bar  date.  Furthermore,\n\nSimon concededly knew,  before the bar date, that he  had a claim\n\nagainst FDIC for the return of the collateral.   In these circum-\n\nstances,  the failure to comply  with the ACRP  deprived the dis-\n\ntrict  court of jurisdiction  over Simon's claim  for recovery of\n\nthe collateral securing his personal guaranty.1\n                    \r                              \n\n     1Notwithstanding the jurisdictional bar to Simon's claim for\nthe return of his collateral, he contends that the district court\nshould  have declared  his  personal guaranty  discharged by  the\nBank's material  breach of  its Modification Agreements  with the\nBorrowers, see, e.g., Ward  v. American Mut. Liab. Ins.  Co., 443\r                                                                      \nN.E.2d 1342, 1344 (Mass.  App. 1983), and that  such a claim  for\ndeclaratory relief is not  barred because it does not  seek \"pay-\nment  from\" the Bank's  \"assets.\"   Simon's complaint  demanded a\ndeclaration  extinguishing any  personal liability  arising under\nhis  loan  guaranty;  that  is, precluding  any  future  judgment\nagainst  him for any deficiency over and above the amounts recov-\nerable by FDIC on the collateral  securing his personal guaranty.\nAlthough the claim  to the  collateral is barred  as one  against\r                                                \n\"the [Bank's] assets,\"  12 U.S.C.   1821(d)(13)(D)(i), the  judi-\ncial declaration requested by  Simon is said to be  purely defen-\nsive, designed  to preempt any obligation on the part of Simon to\nmake future payments  to FDIC.   See, e.g.,  National Union  Fire\r                                                                           \nIns.  Co. v. City Sav., FSB, 28  F.3d 376 (3d Cir. 1994) (holding\r                                     \nthat    1821(d)(13)(D)(i) bars contracting party  from preemptive\njudicial  declaration that  contracting  party is  not liable  on\ncontract  with failed  institution, even  though claim  cannot be\nbrought under ACRP; contracting party must await suit by receiver\nto  enforce contract, at  which time contracting  party may raise\nrescission as affirmative defense to receiver's contract action).\nSimon urges  us to reject  the Third Circuit's  interpretation in\nNational Union, 28 F.3d  at 386-89, that the alternate  clause in\r                        \n  1821(d)(13)(D)  (viz.,  \"action[s] seeking  a  determination of\r                                \nrights  with respect to []  the [bank's] assets,\")  bars his pre-\nemptive claim for declaratory relief.  \n     We  find this  an  inappropriate setting  for resolving  the\nquestion  in  National Union,  which was  not  raised below.   In\r                                      \naddition,  dismissal of these claims by the district court was in\nall events proper, since Simon's claimed entitlement to discharge\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nB.

See id.   1821(e)(3)(i).\r                                                          \n\nThe Borrowers assert that all obligations they  incurred to third\n\nparties after FDIC was appointed receiver are entitled to priori-\r                       \n\nty status against Bank  assets, on the theory that  the Modifica-\n\ntion Agreements remained executory at the time FDIC was appointed\n\nreceiver.    Consequently,  the Borrowers  argue,  the  executory\n\nModification Agreements remained  open to affirmance or  repudia-\n\ntion by  FDIC within a  reasonable period following  its appoint-\n\nment.   See id.   1821(e)(1)-(2).   Since FDIC has  yet to affirm\r                         \n\nthe  Modification  Agreements, the  Borrowers  conclude that  the\n\nagreements have been repudiated.  \n\n          Their  claim  is  premature,  for  failure  to  exhaust\n\n                    \r                              \n\nfails as a matter of Massachusetts law.  See Levy v. FDIC, 7 F.3d\r                                                                   \n1054, 1056 (1st Cir. 1993) (appellate court is \"free to affirm  a\ndistrict court's  ruling 'on any  ground supported in  the record\neven if the issue was not pleaded, tried or otherwise referred to\nin the  proceeding below'\")  (citations omitted).   The Massachu-\nsetts cases cited by  Simon stand only for the  generic contract-\nlaw proposition that a material breach excuses future performance\nby  the non-breaching party.  These cases do not purport to hold,\nhowever, that  a loan guarantor  is relieved  from liability  for\ndelinquent  pre-breach  loan  advances  to the  borrowers.    The\noutstanding balances due by the Borrowers total well in excess of\nSimon's  $900,000 unconditional  guaranty.   See  generally Fleet\r                                                                           \nNat'l Bank v. Liuzzo, 766 F.

Finally, Simon not\nonly cites no contractual provision that even purports to entitle\nhim to such blanket relief, but his January 1988 personal guaran-\nty,  incorporated  by  reference  in the  modified  guaranty,  is\ncouched in  unconditional language.

Simon (\"Simon\"), Webb Place Condominiums, Inc.  (\"Webb Place\") and Greystone Condominiums, Inc.  (\"Greystone\") initiated this action in Massachusetts state court against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"), receiver of 1st American Bank for Savings (\"Bank\"), seeking declaratory and equitable relief relating to two real estate loan agreements between plaintiffs-appellants and the Bank.  Following removal, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts dismissed the action on jurisdictional grounds pursuant to the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (\"FIRREA\"), 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(13)(D) (1994).  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1988, Simon, president and sole stockholder of Greystone and Webb Place (collectively:  \"Borrowers\"), entered into two mortgage loan agreements with the Bank, whereby Greystone borrowed $2,500,000 and Webb Place borrowed a total of $3,150,000 with which to finance condominium development projects.  The loans were secured by mortgages on the properties to be developed and by Simon's personal guaranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the loans matured on January 31, 1990, the Borrowers sought extensions and further advances to enable completion of the projects.  On August 14, 1990, with the outstanding loan balances at $2,500,000 on the Greystone loan and $2,295,490 on the Webb Place loan, the Borrowers entered into two separate Loan Modification Agreements (\"Modification Agreements\"), whereby the Bank waived all accrued and future interest on the original January 1988 loans and extended their maturity dates to May 31, 1992.  The Bank further agreed to lend an additional $816,000 to Greystone and $520,942 to Webb Place, to be disbursed upon the Borrowers' request, for completion of the projects.  Finally, the Bank agreed to provide end-loan financing to individual buyers of the completed condominium units.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Borrowers in turn agreed to complete construction of the mortgaged properties under the supervision of an independent engineer, to devise a marketing plan acceptable to the Bank, and to pay the Bank 100% of the net proceeds from the sale of any unit in the mortgaged properties in return for a partial release of the Bank's mortgage lien.  Simon secured his loan guaranties with two certificates of deposit and with mortgages on two real estate properties owned by him.  In return, the Bank agreed to limit Simon's total liability on the personal guaranty to $900,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All construction loan requisitions by the Borrowers were honored in due course by the Bank until October 18, 1990, when a requisition for $204,657 was dishonored.  The following day, the Bank closed and FDIC was appointed receiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 24, FDIC published notice of its appointment as receiver, alerting creditors that all claims against the Bank were to be submitted to FDIC by January 23, 1991 (\"bar date\").  On October 25, FDIC mailed notice to all known Bank creditors and, on October 31, notice of FDIC's appointment as liquidating agent of the Bank was mailed to plaintiffs-appellants.  Although plaintiffs-appellants did not receive FDIC's notice, they were aware prior to the bar date that FDIC had been appointed receiver of the Bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 31, plaintiffs-appellants requested that FDIC advise as to its position respecting further loan disbursements under the Modification Agreements.  FDIC did not reply.  On November 27, plaintiffs-appellants informed FDIC that the Bank was in default under the Modification Agreements for refusing their October 18 requisition.  Their letter demanded that the Borrowers' requisitions be met and that the collateral securing Simon's personal guaranty be released due to the Bank's default.  FDIC did not reply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present action was commenced on April 21, 1992, in state court.  Simon sued to recover all collateral pledged to secure his personal guaranty and for a judicial declaration that his personal obligations under the guaranty had been extinguished as a result of the Bank's and FDIC's defaults under the Modification Agreements.  The Borrowers sought a judicial declaration entitling them to a \"priority position\" among Bank creditors on all obligations incurred by the Borrowers to third parties after FDIC took possession of the Bank's assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After removal, the federal district court granted the FDIC motion for summary judgment.  It found that neither Simon nor the Borrowers had filed proofs of claim with FDIC despite having received actual notice of FDIC's appointment.  Plaintiffs-appellants thus having failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, the district court ruled that their claims were barred under 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(13)(D)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment rulings are reviewed de novo to determine whether the \" 'pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.' \"  Gaskell v. The Harvard Coop.  Soc'y, 3 F.3d 495, 497 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).  We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party resisting summary judgment.  Velez-Gomez v.

The Simon Guaranty</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simon contends that FDIC surrendered all claims to the collateral pledged to secure his personal guaranty because the Bank's (and FDIC's subsequent) breach of the Modification Agreements discharged Simon from all liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1821(d)(13)(D)(i) bars all claims against the assets of a failed financial institution which have not been presented under the administrative claims review process (\"ACRP\"), see 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(3)-(10), governing the filing, determination, and payment of claims against the assets of failed financial institutions following FDIC's appointment as receiver.  Heno v. FDIC, 20 F.3d 1204, 1206-07 (1st Cir.1994).  Upon its appointment as receiver, FDIC is required to publish notice that the failed institution's creditors must file claims with FDIC by a specified date not less than ninety days after the date of publication.  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(3)(B).  FDIC is also required to mail notice to all known creditors of the failed institution.  Id. Sec. 1821(d)(3)(C).  It has 180 days from the date of filing to allow or disallow claims.  Id. Sec. 1821(d)(5)(A)(i).  Claimants have sixty days from the date of disallowance, or from the expiration of the 180-day administrative decision deadline, within which to seek judicial review in an appropriate United States district court.  Id. Sec. 1821(d)(6)(A).  Failure to comply with the ACRP deprives the courts of subject matter jurisdiction over any claim to assets of the failed financial institution.  See id. Sec. 1821(d)(13)(D)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simon argues that the instant claim for the return of all collateral securing his personal guaranty is not subject to the ACRP because it is not a creditor's claim against the Bank's assets but merely a defense to the contingent loan guaranty held by the Bank.  Cf. In re Purcell, 141 B.R. 480, 485 (Bankr.D.Vt.1992), aff'd, 150 B.R. 111 (D.Vt.1993).  But see Deera Homes, Inc. v. Metrobank for Sav., FSB, 812 F.Supp. 375, 377-78 (E.D.N.Y.1993).  As Simon sees it, therefore, he is entitled to a judgment declaring that the Modification Agreements were breached by the Bank and, consequently, his personal guaranty is unenforceable and the collateral pledged to secure it must be surrendered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout the litigation, Simon has maintained that the Bank breached the Modification Agreements the day before the Bank closed, by refusing to honor the Borrowers' October 18 construction loan requisition.  At oral argument, he conceded that the personal guaranty was no longer executory by the time FDIC became receiver on October 19, 1990.  Cf. infra Section II.B.  Similarly, his claim to the collateral securing the personal guaranty consistently has been based on the Bank's October 18 breach of the Modification Agreements.  Moreover, Simon's November 27 letter to FDIC demanded both that the Bank release the collateral securing his personal guaranty and that the Bank honor the Borrowers' requisitions from October 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Simon's position is and always has been that the Bank's pre-receivership refusal to honor the Borrowers' October 18 loan requisition constituted a material breach of the Modification Agreements, entitling him to recover his collateral.  It is clear, therefore, that the claim to the collateral securing the personal guaranty is barred as a \"claim or action for payment from ... the assets\" of a failed financial institution for which FDIC has been appointed receiver.  See 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(13)(D)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simon concedes that the two real estate mortgages securing his personal guaranty are bank \"assets.\"   Claims for the recovery of bank assets are barred absent compliance with the ACRP.  Id.  Simon was aware of FDIC's appointment as receiver on October 19, 1990, well before the ACRP bar date.  Furthermore, Simon concededly knew, before the bar date, that he had a claim against FDIC for the return of the collateral.  In these circumstances, the failure to comply with the ACRP deprived the district court of jurisdiction over Simon's claim for recovery of the collateral securing his personal guaranty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Borrowers' Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Borrowers seek compensatory damages for FDIC's alleged post-bar-date repudiation of their pre-receivership Modification Agreements with the Bank.  See id. Sec. 1821(e)(3)(i).  The Borrowers assert that all obligations they incurred to third parties after FDIC was appointed receiver are entitled to priority status against Bank assets, on the theory that the Modification Agreements remained executory at the time FDIC was appointed receiver.  Consequently, the Borrowers argue, the executory Modification Agreements remained open to affirmance or repudiation by FDIC within a reasonable period following its appointment.  See id. Sec. 1821(e)(1)-(2).  Since FDIC has yet to affirm the Modification Agreements, the Borrowers conclude that the agreements have been repudiated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Their claim is premature, for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.  See Heno v. FDIC, 20 F.3d at 1212-13 (publishing FDIC internal manual procedures for filing claims arising from FDIC's post-bar-date repudiation of executory prereceivership contracts with failed institution).  In Heno, we deferred to FDIC's construction of its enabling statute as according the agency first opportunity to evaluate alleged post-bar-date claims, including those arising after the ninety-day period following notice of FDIC's appointment as receiver, id. at 1209.   As the Borrowers have yet to exhaust their administrative remedies pursuant to the internal agency procedures published in Heno, we affirm the district court judgment, without prejudice to Borrowers' subsequent submission of an administrative claim to FDIC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgment is affirmed.  The parties are to bear their own costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Notwithstanding the jurisdictional bar to Simon's claim for the return of his collateral, he contends that the district court should have declared his personal guaranty discharged by the Bank's material breach of its Modification Agreements with the Borrowers, see, e.g., Ward v. American Mut. Liab.  Ins. Co., 15 Mass.App.Ct. 98, 443 N.E.2d 1342, 1344 (1983), and that such a claim for declaratory relief is not barred because it does not seek \"payment from\" the Bank's \"assets.\"   Simon's complaint demanded a declaration extinguishing any personal liability arising under his loan guaranty;  that is, precluding any future judgment against him for any deficiency over and above the amounts recoverable by FDIC on the collateral securing his personal guaranty.  Although the claim to the collateral is barred as one against \"the [Bank's] assets,\" 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(13)(D)(i), the judicial declaration requested by Simon is said to be purely defensive, designed to preempt any obligation on the part of Simon to make future payments to FDIC.  See, e.g., National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. City Sav., FSB, 28 F.3d 376 (3d Cir.1994) (holding that Sec. 1821(d)(13)(D)(i) bars contracting party from preemptive judicial declaration that contracting party is not liable on contract with failed institution, even though claim cannot be brought under ACRP;  contracting party must await suit by receiver to enforce contract, at which time contracting party may raise rescission as affirmative defense to receiver's contract action).  Simon urges us to reject the Third Circuit's interpretation in National Union, 28 F.3d at 386-89, that the alternate clause in Sec. 1821(d)(13)(D) (viz., \"action[s] seeking a determination of rights with respect to [ ] the [bank's] assets,\") bars his preemptive claim for declaratory relief</p>\n        <p>We find this an inappropriate setting for resolving the question in National Union, which was not raised below.  In addition, dismissal of these claims by the district court was in all events proper, since Simon's claimed entitlement to discharge fails as a matter of Massachusetts law.  See Levy v. FDIC, 7 F.3d 1054, 1056 (1st Cir.1993) (appellate court is \"free to affirm a district court's ruling 'on any ground supported in the record even if the issue was not pleaded, tried or otherwise referred to in the proceeding below' \") (citations omitted).  The Massachusetts cases cited by Simon stand only for the generic contract-law proposition that a material breach excuses future performance by the non-breaching party.  These cases do not purport to hold, however, that a loan guarantor is relieved from liability for delinquent pre-breach loan advances to the borrowers.  The outstanding balances due by the Borrowers total well in excess of Simon's $900,000 unconditional guaranty.  See generally Fleet Nat'l Bank v. Liuzzo, 766 F.Supp. 61, 65 (D.R.I.1991) (describing nonmutality of promise to repay loan).  Finally, Simon not only cites no contractual provision that even purports to entitle him to such blanket relief, but his January 1988 personal guaranty, incorporated by reference in the modified guaranty, is couched in unconditional language.  (\"The Guarantor's liability hereunder is absolute and unlimited....\").  Thus, the request for declaratory relief was properly rejected.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The Bank further agreed to lend an additional $816,000 to Greystone and $520,942 to Webb Place, to be disbursed upon the Borrowers' request, for completion of the projects.  Finally, the Bank agreed to provide end-loan financing to individual buyers of the completed condominium units.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Borrowers in turn agreed to complete construction of the mortgaged properties under the supervision of an independent engineer, to devise a marketing plan acceptable to the Bank, and to pay the Bank 100% of the net proceeds from the sale of any unit in the mortgaged properties in return for a partial release of the Bank's mortgage lien.  Simon secured his loan guaranties with two certificates of deposit and with mortgages on two real estate properties owned by him.  In return, the Bank agreed to limit Simon's total liability on the personal guaranty to $900,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All construction loan requisitions by the Borrowers were honored in due course by the Bank until October 18, 1990, when a requisition for $204,657 was dishonored.  The following day, the Bank closed and FDIC was appointed receiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 24, FDIC published notice of its appointment as receiver, alerting creditors that all claims against the Bank were to be submitted to FDIC by January 23, 1991 (\"bar date\").  On October 25, FDIC mailed notice to all known Bank creditors and, on October 31, notice of FDIC's appointment as liquidating agent of the Bank was mailed to plaintiffs-appellants.  Although plaintiffs-appellants did not receive FDIC's notice, they were aware prior to the bar date that FDIC had been appointed receiver of the Bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 31, plaintiffs-appellants requested that FDIC advise as to its position respecting further loan disbursements under the Modification Agreements.  FDIC did not reply.  On November 27, plaintiffs-appellants informed FDIC that the Bank was in default under the Modification Agreements for refusing their October 18 requisition.  Their letter demanded that the Borrowers' requisitions be met and that the collateral securing Simon's personal guaranty be released due to the Bank's default.  FDIC did not reply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present action was commenced on April 21, 1992, in state court.  Simon sued to recover all collateral pledged to secure his personal guaranty and for a judicial declaration that his personal obligations under the guaranty had been extinguished as a result of the Bank's and FDIC's defaults under the Modification Agreements.  The Borrowers sought a judicial declaration entitling them to a \"priority position\" among Bank creditors on all obligations incurred by the Borrowers to third parties after FDIC took possession of the Bank's assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After removal, the federal district court granted the FDIC motion for summary judgment.  It found that neither Simon nor the Borrowers had filed proofs of claim with FDIC despite having received actual notice of FDIC's appointment.  Plaintiffs-appellants thus having failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, the district court ruled that their claims were barred under 12 U.S.C.

Cf. In re Purcell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1873696\"><a href=\"/opinion/1873696/in-re-purcell/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 485 (Bankr.D.Vt.1992), aff'd, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1866374\"><a href=\"/opinion/1866374/in-re-purcell/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span> </a></span>(D.Vt.1993).  But see Deera Homes, Inc. v. Metrobank for Sav., FSB, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></span>, 377-78 (E.D.N.Y.1993).  As Simon sees it, therefore, he is entitled to a judgment declaring that the Modification Agreements were breached by the Bank and, consequently, his personal guaranty is unenforceable and the collateral pledged to secure it must be surrendered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout the litigation, Simon has maintained that the Bank breached the Modification Agreements the day before the Bank closed, by refusing to honor the Borrowers' October 18 construction loan requisition.  At oral argument, he conceded that the personal guaranty was no longer executory by the time FDIC became receiver on October 19, 1990.  Cf. infra Section II.B.  Similarly, his claim to the collateral securing the personal guaranty consistently has been based on the Bank's October 18 breach of the Modification Agreements.  Moreover, Simon's November 27 letter to FDIC demanded both that the Bank release the collateral securing his personal guaranty and that the Bank honor the Borrowers' requisitions from October 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Simon's position is and always has been that the Bank's pre-receivership refusal to honor the Borrowers' October 18 loan requisition constituted a material breach of the Modification Agreements, entitling him to recover his collateral.  It is clear, therefore, that the claim to the collateral securing the personal guaranty is barred as a \"claim or action for payment from ... the assets\" of a failed financial institution for which FDIC has been appointed receiver.  See 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(13)(D)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simon concedes that the two real estate mortgages securing his personal guaranty are bank \"assets.\"   Claims for the recovery of bank assets are barred absent compliance with the ACRP.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  Simon was </span>aware of FDIC's appointment as receiver on October 19, 1990, well before the ACRP bar date.  Furthermore, Simon concededly knew, before the bar date, that he had a claim against FDIC for the return of the collateral.  In these circumstances, the failure to comply with the ACRP deprived the district court of jurisdiction over Simon's claim for recovery of the collateral securing his personal guaranty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Borrowers' Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Borrowers seek compensatory damages for FDIC's alleged post-bar-date repudiation of their pre-receivership Modification Agreements with the Bank.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Sec. 1821(e)(3)(i). </span> The Borrowers assert that all obligations they incurred to third parties after FDIC was appointed receiver are entitled to priority status against Bank assets, on the theory that the Modification Agreements remained executory at the time FDIC was appointed receiver.  Consequently, the Borrowers argue, the executory Modification Agreements remained open to affirmance or repudiation by FDIC within a reasonable period following its appointment.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Sec. 1821(e)(1)-(2). </span> Since FDIC has yet to affirm the Modification Agreements, the Borrowers conclude that the agreements have been repudiated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Their claim is premature, for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.  See Heno v. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"667150\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">FDIC,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/667150/floyd-v-heno-v-federal-deposit-insurance-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1212-13</span> </a></span>(publishing FDIC internal manual procedures for filing claims arising from FDIC's post-bar-date repudiation of executory prereceivership contracts with failed institution).  In Heno, we deferred to FDIC's construction of its enabling statute as according the agency first opportunity to evaluate alleged post-bar-date claims, including those arising after the ninety-day period following notice of FDIC's appointment as receiver, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"667150\"><a href=\"/opinion/667150/floyd-v-heno-v-federal-deposit-insurance-corporation/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1209. </a></span>  As the Borrowers have yet to exhaust their administrative remedies pursuant to the internal agency procedures published in Heno, we affirm the district court judgment, without prejudice to Borrowers' subsequent submission of an administrative claim to FDIC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgment is affirmed.

American Mut. Liab.  Ins. Co., 15 Mass.App.Ct. 98, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1978861\"><a href=\"/opinion/1978861/ward-v-american-mutual-liability-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1342</span></a></span>, 1344 (1983), and that such a claim for declaratory relief is not barred because it does not seek \"payment from\" the Bank's \"assets.\"   Simon's complaint demanded a declaration extinguishing any personal liability arising under his loan guaranty;  that is, precluding any future judgment against him for any deficiency over and above the amounts recoverable by FDIC on the collateral securing his personal guaranty.  Although the claim to the collateral is barred as one against \"the [Bank's] assets,\" 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(13)(D)(i), the judicial declaration requested by Simon is said to be purely defensive, designed to preempt any obligation on the part of Simon to make future payments to FDIC.  See, e.g., National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. City Sav., FSB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673431\"><a href=\"/opinion/673431/national-union-fire-insurance-company-of-pittsburgh-pa-gulf-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span> </a></span>(3d Cir.1994) (holding that Sec. 1821(d)(13)(D)(i) bars contracting party from preemptive judicial declaration that contracting party is not liable on contract with failed institution, even though claim cannot be brought under ACRP;  contracting party must await suit by receiver to enforce contract, at which time contracting party may raise rescission as affirmative defense to receiver's contract action).  Simon urges us to reject the Third Circuit's interpretation in National <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673431\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Union,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/673431/national-union-fire-insurance-company-of-pittsburgh-pa-gulf-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">386-89</span></a></span>, that the alternate clause in Sec. 1821(d)(13)(D) (viz., \"action[s] seeking a determination of rights with respect to [ ] the [bank's] assets,\") bars his preemptive claim for declaratory relief</p>\n        <p>We find this an inappropriate setting for resolving the question in National Union, which was not raised below.  In addition, dismissal of these claims by the district court was in all events proper, since Simon's claimed entitlement to discharge fails as a matter of Massachusetts law.  See Levy v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194983\"><a href=\"/opinion/194983/levy-v-weinhold/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1054</span></a></span>, 1056 (1st Cir.1993) (appellate court is \"free to affirm a district court's ruling 'on any ground supported in the record even if the issue was not pleaded, tried or otherwise referred to in the proceeding below' \") (citations omitted).  The Massachusetts cases cited by Simon stand only for the generic contract-law proposition that a material breach excuses future performance by the non-breaching party.  These cases do not purport to hold, however, that a loan guarantor is relieved from liability for delinquent pre-breach loan advances to the borrowers.  The outstanding balances due by the Borrowers total well in excess of Simon's $900,000 unconditional guaranty.  See generally Fleet Nat'l Bank v. Liuzzo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">766</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></span>, 65 (D.R.I.1991) (describing nonmutality of promise to repay loan).  Finally, Simon not only cites no contractual provision that even purports to entitle him to such blanket relief, but his January 1988 personal guaranty, incorporated by reference in the modified guaranty, is couched in unconditional language.  (\"The Guarantor's liability hereunder is absolute and unlimited....\").  Thus, the request for declaratory relief was properly rejected.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
