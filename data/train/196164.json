Korman, Counsel,  Department  of Correction,  on brief  for\r                         \r\nappellees.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  We  have carefully reviewed the briefs\r                                \r\n\nand record  and conclude that summary  judgment was correctly\r\n\nentered for defendants.   We  briefly comment  on several  of\r\n\nplaintiff's arguments.\r\n\n          1.   Plaintiff  contends  that  the district  court\r\n\nshould  have  granted  his  request for  additional  time  to\r\n\nrespond to defendants'  motion for summary judgment.   By the\r\n\ntime plaintiff's motion was  docketed, the district court had\r\n\nalready  entered  judgment  for  defendants.    Consequently,\r\n\nplaintiff's motion, in its  present form, was moot.   At that\r\n\npoint,  if  plaintiff  still  wanted to  file  a  substantive\r\n\nresponse  to  defendants'  motion for  summary  judgment,  he\r\n\nshould have timely filed a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e)\r\n\nor Fed.  R. Civ. P. 60(b) asking the district court to vacate\r\n\nits judgment and consider plaintiff's response.  As plaintiff\r\n\ndid not do either and never filed a substantive opposition to\r\n\ndefendants'  motion for  summary  judgment,  we  confine  our\r\n\nreview to the district  court record and do not  consider any\r\n\nnew  factual allegations  plaintiff raises  in his  appellate\r\n\nbrief.\r\r\n\n          2.  The  one instance  in which  plaintiff did  not\r\n\nreceive  one of his four daily dosages of pain medication did\r\n\nnot amount to an Eighth Amendment violation.\r\n\n          As  for the prescribed medication plaintiff says he\r\n\nkept  in his cell, plaintiff's January 28, 1993 letter to Lt.\r\n\nSilva  requested  that  all   his  property  be  mailed  out.\r                                       \r\n\nPlaintiff did  not specifically  point out an  immediate need\r\n\nfor the  medications.   In those circumstances,  the district\r\n\ncourt  could  properly  conclude  that  summary judgment  was\r\n\nappropriate  because  plaintiff had  not  shown  a basis  for\r\n\ninferring  that defendants  were deliberately  indifferent to\r                                                         \r\n\nplaintiff's medical needs.\r\n\n          Defendants'   submissions  showed   that  plaintiff\r\n\nconsistently   refused  to  comply   with  alternate  feeding\r\n\nprocedures either by remaining silent, saying no, or claiming\r\n\nhe wasn't hungry.  Below, plaintiff described only one of the\r\n\nmeals tendered -- a cheese sandwich.  In these circumstances,\r\n\nwhere plaintiff  was repeatedly  afforded  an opportunity  to\r\n\ncome off  alternate feeding but did  not cooperate, plaintiff\r\n\nmay  not   properly  complain  that  defendants   denied  his\r\n\nmedically prescribed diet.\r\n\n          3.    Plaintiff contends  he  was  deprived of  the\r\n\nnecessities of life in violation of the Eighth Amendment when\r\n\nhe was  placed  on  alternate  feeding and  for  some  period\r\n\nthereafter.   We  confine our  review to  the  district court\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nrecord and do not  consider the new allegations  presented in\r\n\nplaintiff's appellate brief.  On that basis, we conclude that\r\n\nthe  temporary restrictions,  which,  according to  the  fair\r\n\nthrust  of the  district court record,  lasted under  a week,\r\n\nwere not  unconstitutionally cruel.  Our affirmance, however,\r\n\nis  without prejudice  to plaintiff's  bringing a  new action\r\n\nchallenging  the conditions  of his  confinement once  he was\r\n\nplaced  on  alternate  feeding.    In  his  appellate  brief,\r\n\nplaintiff asserts that he  had no clothes, was confined  to a\r\n\ncold cell twenty-four hours  a day, was denied  blankets, had\r\n\nno  running water, and was not allowed to shower from January\r\n\n26,  1993 until February 16, 1993.  While his allegations are\r\n\nsomewhat vague, undeveloped, and even contradictory at times,\r\n\nwe think  plaintiff should be afforded  a further opportunity\r\n\nto  clarify  his   allegations,  particularly   in  view   of\r\n\nplaintiff's unsuccessful attempt below to extend the time for\r\n\nresponding  to  defendants'  motion  for   summary  judgment.\r\n\nConsequently, we direct that the summary judgment entered for\r\n\ndefendants be  without prejudice to plaintiff's  filing a new\r\n\naction  challenging the  conditions of  his confinement  from\r\n\nJanuary 26, 1993 to February 16, 1993.\r\n\n          4.   Plaintiff contends  he was denied  due process\r\n\nduring  his  disciplinary  hearing.    Summary  judgment  was\r\n\nproperly entered for defendants.  Plaintiff was not convicted\r\n\nof  any  throwing offense.    Plaintiff's  attacks on  Lopes'\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nallegations and the evidence  relating to that charge  do not\r\n\nstate  any due process claim.   Freeman v.  Rideout, 808 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n949,   951-53  (2d   Cir.  1986)   (\"prison  inmate   has  no\r\n\nconstitutionally  guaranteed immunity  from being  falsely or\r\n\nwrongly  accused   of  conduct   which  may  result   in  the\r\n\ndeprivation of a protected  liberty interest\"), cert. denied,\r                                                                        \r\n\n485 U.S. 982  (1988).  Prison officials gave adequate reasons\r\n\nfor denying  two of plaintiff's requested  witnesses, and the\r\n\nverbal insolence  finding  was adequately  supported  by  the\r\n\nevidence.\r\n\n          We have considered all of plaintiff's arguments and\r\n\naffirm the judgment below, but  direct that the affirmance is\r\n\nwithout  prejudice   to  plaintiff's  filing  a   new  action\r\n\nchallenging the  conditions of  his confinement  from January\r\n\n26, 1993 until February 16, 1993.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",
