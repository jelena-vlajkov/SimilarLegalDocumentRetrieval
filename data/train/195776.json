Petitioner Stephen Dawodu seeks review\r                                \n\nof  a Board of  Immigration Appeals order  denying his motion\n\nseeking  reconsideration  of  the  Board's  dismissal  of his\n\nappeal from an  immigration judge's denial  of his motion  to\n\nreopen his deportation proceedings.  We deny the petition for\n\nreview for the reasons  stated by the Board in  its decisions\n\ndated  February 23, 1994 and April 8,  1994.  We add only the\n\nfollowing brief comments.\n\n          On   appeal,  Dawodu  suggests   that  one  of  the\n\nquestions before us is the validity of his deportation order.\n\nWe disagree.   Since Dawodu  failed to file  any appeal  from\n\nthat order, the  only issue before us  is essentially whether\n\nhis motion to reopen  was properly denied.  See  Aiyadurai v.\r                                                                      \n\nINS,  683  F.2d 1195,  1198-99  (8th  Cir. 1982).    Dawodu's\r               \n\nargument  that he  should not  be deported  because he  had a\n\nvalid, approved visa  petition is not relevant to that issue.\n\nOther arguments that Dawodu raises now were  not presented to\n\nthe Board and thus are deemed waived.  See Thomas v. INS, 976\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d 786, 789 (1st  Cir. 1992).  Finally, the  plain language\n\nof  8  U.S.C.      1252b(c)(3)(A)  forecloses  rescission  of\n\ndeportation  orders if a motion to reopen is not timely filed\n\nunder  the  statute.    Therefore,  to  the  extent  that the\n\nimmigration judge may have believed that he had discretion to\n\nconsider Dawodu's motion despite the statutory bar, he erred.\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\r                                                        \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
