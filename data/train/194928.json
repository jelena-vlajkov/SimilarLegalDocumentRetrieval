The  fraud involved an\n\nintricate and sophisticated scheme involving a technique known as\n\na  \"land flip,\" under which real  property is purchased for a low\n\nprice, immediately  resold at a much  higher price to  a straw or\n\nfictitious  buyer, and  the higher  resale price  is used  as the\n\nbasis  for obtaining  a mortgage  loan that  finances the  entire\n\ntransaction.  One of the defendants also challenges her sentence.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n                                I.\n\n             A jury in the  United States District  Court for  the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts convicted  the defendants Cassiere  and\n\nPezzullo  of fifteen counts of wire fraud and aiding and abetting\n\nwire fraud, and the  defendant Dolber of thirteen counts  of that\n\ncrime (it acquitted her on one count), in violation  of 18 U.S.C.\n\n   1343  (1988),  and  all  three  defendants  of  one  count  of\n\nconspiracy to commit wire fraud, in  violation of 18 U.S.C.   371\n\n(1988).   The  district  court sentenced  Cassiere  to 46  months\n\nimprisonment,  followed by  five  years  of  supervised  release,\n\nPezzullo to 24  months imprisonment, followed  by three years  of\n\nsupervised  release,  and  Dolber   to  39  months  imprisonment,\n\nfollowed by  three years of  supervised release.   Each defendant\n\nalso was ordered to make restitution.\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\n             The  substantive   crimes   for   which   the   three\n\ndefendants  were  convicted  involved their  participation  in  a\n\nscheme to  defraud  six  mortgage  lenders through  a  series  of\n\nfifteen land flips, in all but one of  which the two sales of the\n\nproperty  were  closed  on  the   same  day,  often  the   second\n\nimmediately following the first.  Cassiere was the senior partner\n\nof  Pezzullo  in  a two-person  law  firm  that  handled all  the\n\nclosings in the land flip transactions.  Dolber was a real estate\n\nappraiser, whose appraisals  of the properties were  relied on by\n\nthe mortgage lenders in making their loans.\n\n             Rate Line  was a  mortgage broker which,  for a  fee,\n\ntook  loan applications  and  referred them  to lenders.   Thomas\n\nDeNunzio  owned Rate Line, and  he and his  employee loan broker,\n\nGlenn  Monteiro, controlled  Rate  Line.   DeNunzio and  Monteiro\n\nplanned and organized the  fraudulent scheme, under which one  of\n\nthree straw corporations they controlled (Half  &amp; Half, Inc., ZBA\n\nCorp.  and Chantel, Inc.)  purchased foreclosed property for cash\n\nand resold the property on the same day to straw buyers at a much\n\nhigher price.   Mortgage  loan  funds received  from the  lending\n\ninstitutions were used to pay  the corporation controlled by Rate\n\nLine  and that  corporation then  paid for  the first sale.   The\n\nbalance  then went  to DeNunzio  and Monteiro,  channeled through\n\nRate Line.  \n\n             DeNunzio  and  Monteiro  pleaded  guilty  to  another\n\nindictment  and  they both  testified for  the government  in the\n\npresent  case.  They described in detail how the scheme operated,\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\nthe roles Cassiere,  Pezzullo, and Dolber  played in the  scheme,\n\nandDeNunzio's andMonteiro's relationshipwith thethree defendants.\n\n             An  example of  the  operation of  the scheme  was as\n\nfollows:\n\n             On April  12, 1991,  Half &amp;  Half Corporation  closed\n\nthe  purchase  of  property at  104  Menlo  Street  for $102,900.\n\nMoments later Half &amp; Half closed the sale of the property to Fred\n\nStrangis,  one of  the dummy  purchasers,  for $228,000.   Dolber\n\npreviously had appraised the property at $228,000.  Based on this\n\nappraisal and Strangis' certification that he would reside at 104\n\nMenlo  Street,  Rate  Line  gave  Strangis  a  mortgage  loan  of\n\n$182,400, which was eighty percent of the final sale price.  Rate\n\nLine,  in  turn, sold  Strangis'  mortgage  to CenTrust  Mortgage\n\nCorporation.  Neither Half  and Half nor Strangis brought  a down\n\npayment to  the double  closing.   Instead,  Monteiro provided  a\n\ncashier's check for the twenty percent down payment ($45,600) the\n\nlender required the purchaser to make.\n\n             Cassiere  and   Pezzullo  recorded  both  deeds   and\n\ndisbursed the funds they had received from the lender.  They paid\n\nthe original owner  the $102,900 owed  by Half &amp; Half,  they paid\n\nthe  closing costs, including attorneys' fees  due them, and gave\n\nthe balance to Monteiro and DeNunzio. \n\n             Cassiere,  assisted  by  Pezzullo,  was  the  closing\n\nattorney  in each of the  double closings.   They represented the\n\ninterests of the lending  institution that was providing, through\n\nRate Line,  the mortgage loan  to the final  buyer.  The  closing\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\nattorney serves as \"the eyes and ears\" of the lending institution\n\nat the closing.  The lenders expected the attorneys to alert them\n\nto anything unusual.  Neither Cassiere nor Pezzullo  notified any\n\nof  the six lenders that their law  firm was closing twice on the\n\nsame property on the same day at  substantially different prices.\n\nDolber  was the real estate  appraiser in thirteen  of the flips.\n\nThe lending  institutions relied  on her appraisals  to determine\n\nthe  value of the properties  upon which they  were making loans.\n\nThe appraisal alerts the lenders  to the property's condition and\n\nallows them to determine their ability to recoup their investment\n\nshould the borrower default on the mortgage.               \n\n             The lenders  generally made  loans of  the lesser  of\n\neighty percent  of the  sale price  or fair  market value of  the\n\nproperty.   The six  lenders made  mortgage loans  totalling more\n\nthan  $2.6 million on the properties that were the subject of the\n\nland flips involved in this case.\n\n             Ten of  the thirteen  appraisals Dolber  made of  the\n\nproperties  involved  in  the  land  flips  were  for  an  amount\n\nidentical  to the final sale price, which ranged from $160,000 to\n\n$231,000.  (The  original sale prices of  those properties ranged\n\nfrom $42,000 to  $132,000.)   Two of the  three other  appraisals\n\nwere for $1,000 higher than the second  sale price; the third was\n\nfor $2,000 higher.  \n\n                 II. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n             Pezzullo and  Dolber, but not Cassiere, challenge the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence to support their convictions. \n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\n             In  reviewing the  record  in such  a  challenge,  we\n\n\"look[]  to  the  evidence   as  a  whole,  including  reasonable\n\ninferences  drawn from  it, in  the light  most favorable  to the\n\nverdict, to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have\n\nfound  the defendant guilty  beyond a reasonable  doubt.\"  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Plummer, 964 F.2d 1251, 1254 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n                                                                \n\n113 S. Ct. 350 (1992).  \"We do not weigh witness credibility, but\n\nresolve  all credibility  issues in  favor of  the verdict.   The\n\nevidence  may be  entirely  circumstantial and  need not  exclude\n\nevery reasonable hypothesis of innocence; that is, the factfinder\n\nmay decide  among  reasonable interpretations  of the  evidence.\"\n\nUnited States v. Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 1991)\n                                \n\n(citations  omitted).    Thus  viewed, the  record  supports  the\n\nconvictions.\n\nA.           The Wire Fraud Convictions\n                                       \n\n             To  prove wire  fraud the government must  show: 1) a\n\nscheme to defraud by means of false pretenses, 2) the defendant's\n\nknowing and willful  participation in the scheme  with the intent\n\nto defraud, and 3)  the use of interstate wire  communications in\n\nfurtherance of the scheme.  United States v. Serrano, 870 F.2d 1,\n                                                    \n\n6 (1st Cir. 1989).  To support convictions of aiding and abetting\n\nwire  fraud,  the  government  must  prove  that  the  \"defendant\n\nassociated [herself] with the underlying venture, participated in\n\nit as something [she]  wished to bring about, and sought by [her]\n\nactions to make it succeed.\"  United States v. Clifford, 979 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\n896, 899 (1st  Cir. 1992) (citing Nye &amp;  Nissen v. United States,\n                                                                \n\n336 U.S. 613, 619 (1949)).\n\n             Neither Pezzullo nor Dolber challenges the  existence\n\nof a  scheme to defraud.   The scheme is shown  by DeNunzio's and\n\nMonteiro's lengthy testimony about the  details of their plan  to\n\ntrick the  lending institutions into making risky loans that were\n\nwarranted by neither the  final purchaser's ability to  repay the\n\nloan nor the  particular property's true market value.   Pezzullo\n\nand  Dolber  also do  not challenge  the  use of  interstate wire\n\ncommunications to  effectuate the plan, as  demonstrated at trial\n\nby testimonial and physical  evidence of the use of  fax machines\n\nand telephone conversations throughout the scheme.  \n\n             Pezzullo and  Dolber, however,  claim that  they were\n\nunaware  of the scheme and therefore were not knowing and willful\n\nparticipants in it.   We hold, however, that the  jury reasonably\n\ncould have concluded from  the voluminous evidence at  trial that\n\nboth  Pezzullo and  Dolber knowingly  participated in  the scheme\n\nwith intent to defraud, and also aided and abetted the fraud.\n\n             1.   Pezzullo\n                          \n\n             Pezzullo  participated  in  all the  double closings,\n\nalmost all  of which took place  at the office of  the Cassiere &amp;\n\nPezzullo law firm.   Fred Strangis testified that Pezzullo's role\n\nwas to \"prepare all the papers and as you're signing them,  would\n\nbring them to you,  try to get you to  read them, try to  explain\n\nthem to you.\"  Frank Andrews and Dennis  Griffin, two other straw\n\nfinal  buyers,  and  Marlissa   Pina,  representing  one  of  the\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\ncontrolled    corporate   purchasers,    corroborated   Strangis'\n\ntestimony.   \n\n             Because   the   lending  institutions   give   higher\n\nmortgages  to  individuals who  live  in the  property  they buy,\n\nStrangis signed Residential Loan Applications and Owner Occupancy\n\nAffidavits, which  Pezzullo gave him, stating that he intended to\n\noccupy  the property.  Strangis  was the final  purchaser of four\n\nproperties,  however,  and  at  closings on  December  12,  1990,\n\nFebruary 6,  1991, April 12, 1991, and  April 15, 1991, he signed\n\nforms stating that four different properties would be his primary\n\nresidence.    Other  straw  final  purchasers   similarly  signed\n\nmultiple owner-occupancy  documents at the  closings: Peter  Pina\n\nwithin one month and  a half signed three  such forms;   Jeanette\n\nMonteiro within a four-month  period twice signed such documents;\n\nDennis  Griffin in one month signed two such documents; and Frank\n\nAndrews within three months  signed two.  Pezzullo  witnessed the\n\nsigning of each of these documents.\n\n             All of the lenders required that the purchaser  bring\n\na twenty percent down payment to  the closing.  Neither the straw\n\nbuyers making  the second  purchases nor the  corporations making\n\nthe first  purchases brought down  payments with them.   Instead,\n\nCassiere or Pezzullo  notified Monteiro before the closing of the\n\namount of the  down payment and he would  bring a cashier's check\n\nfor  that   amount  to  the  closing.    Nonetheless,  the  HUD-1\n\nSettlement Statements  that Cassiere  filled out at  the closings\n\nreported that the buyers had brought the money.  \n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\n             The   only   function  of   the   officers   of   the\n\ncorporations that  DeNunzio and  Monteiro controlled was  to sign\n\nlegal documents designed to  keep Monteiro's and DeNunzio's roles\n\nhidden.  Pezzullo,  however, was aware that DeNunzio and Monteiro\n\ncontrolled the corporations, since Half &amp; Half  used the Cassiere\n\nand Pezzullo offices  as its  corporate address.   At the  double\n\nclosings where each property  was first sold and  then purchased,\n\nneither Cassiere  nor Pezzullo  told the corporate  officers what\n\nthe documents they were  signing meant, or that they  were buying\n\nand selling real property.   \n\n             Pezzullo  handled  the  distribution of  the proceeds\n\nfrom  the  second  half of  the  flip.   The  proceeds  were \"the\n\ndifference between the  loan amount [from  the lender] minus  the\n\nfirst sale price, minus  any closing costs.\"  After  Cassiere and\n\nPezzullo had completed the  deeds on the two sales  following the\n\ndouble closings, Pezzullo disbursed the funds  that came from the\n\nfinal purchaser's  mortgage.   Pezzullo gave Monteiro  the amount\n\ndue to  the original  owner  from the  first  half of  the  flip,\n\nreturned  the  down  payments   to  Monteiro  and  DeNunzio,  and\n\ndistributed the  remaining proceeds to Monteiro  and DeNunzio for\n\nthem  to divide.  In addition to distributing the mortgage funds,\n\nPezzullo prepared  disbursement sheets noting the  funds received\n\nand the funds disbursed.     \n\n             Paul Pires, as Half &amp; Half's president, first  bought\n\nand then sold property in nine of the flips.  At each closing, in\n\nPezzullo's presence,  he  signed a  HUD-1  form and  a  statement\n\n                               -10-\n                                10\n\ncertifying  that he had  received a copy  of the HUD-1  form, yet\n\nneither Cassiere nor Pezzullo ever gave him that document.\n\n             George  Gundensen, president of CenTrust Corporation,\n\none  of  the lending  institutions,  testified  that the  closing\n\nattorney  is expected  to  fill  in  all  blank  spaces  in  loan\n\ndocuments before having the  mortgagor sign the documents.   Some\n\nof  the final buyers signed  forms at the  closing, however, that\n\nwere  completely blank.  In fact, Cassiere and Pezzullo discussed\n\nin Marlissa  Pina's presence that they were  asking her to sign a\n\nblank document. \n\n             Had the  lending institutions been  informed that the\n\nsame law firm  had closed twice on the same  property on the same\n\nday  and with such wide price disparities, they would have either\n\n\"suspend[ed] the loan for  further information or cancell[ed] the\n\nloan.\"   Because  of the  large difference  between the  two sale\n\nprices,  the  lending institution  would  have  believed that  it\n\n\"would  be making a  loan on a  piece of property,  the value for\n\nwhich wouldn't support the amount of the loan being made.\"       \n\n             The  foregoing  evidence,  together  with  additional\n\nevidence  in the  record  we have  not  discussed, justified  the\n\njury's  conclusion that  Pezzullo both  committed wire  fraud and\n\naided and abetted its commission.  \n\n             2.   Dolber\n                        \n\n             Although Dolber  never participated in the  closings,\n\nshe had  a vital role in  making the scheme work.   Her appraisal\n\nforms, which  she  submitted to  Rate  Line, supported  the  high\n\n                               -11-\n                                11\n\nsecond sale price and thus resulted in the higher mortgages.  The\n\nlenders relied  heavily on  the accuracy of  Dolber's appraisals.\n\nAs  noted, every  appraisal  she submitted  on the  thirteen land\n\nflips for properties was identical to the second sale prices, or,\n\nin three instances, slightly higher.  \n\n             DeNunzio testified  that he wanted  to use Dolber  as\n\nthe appraiser because he knew from talking to her that \"she would\n\nbring  in  property values  as high  as  possible,\" and  that she\n\n\"would use non-arm's length  transactions for sales comparisons.\"\n\nBy  non-arm's  length  transactions,  DeNunzio  meant  \"that  the\n\ncomparable  sales  used  were not  a  true  sale  with a  wanting\n\nborrower and  a wanting seller.\"   Instead, the  comparable sales\n\nshe  used  often   were  previous  flips   that  Rate  Line   had\n\nestablished, and, therefore, did not reflect true market value.\n\n             Suburban Mortgage Company made a review appraisal  of\n\none of the properties to evaluate Dolber's appraisal.  Dolber had\n\nappraised the property at $210,000 and described the neighborhood\n\nas \"a  mixture of similar  well maintained income  properties and\n\nmedium   well  maintained  single  family  homes.  .  .  .    The\n\nneighborhood is stable at this time and shows that revitalization\n\nhas  been completed  and upgraded  the area.  . .  .   No adverse\n\nmarket conditions from neighborhood.\"  \n\n             The review appraiser concluded that the market  value\n\nof the property as of the date of Dolber's appraisal was $50,000.\n\nIn  response   to  the  question  \"Is   the  appraiser's  overall\n\ndescription  of the  neighborhood  complete and  accurate?,\"  the\n\n                               -12-\n                                12\n\nreview appraiser  answered \"No\" and explained that  \"This area is\n\nin the midst  of a high crime  drug area of the city.   There are\n\nboarded up buildings, fire damaged units and vacant apartments in\n\nbuildings.  This is  the least desirable area in  the city within\n\nwhich to live.\"  \n\n             Monteiro accompanied  Dolber in  viewing some  of the\n\nappraised properties.  He told her of the proposed sale price for\n\nthe second  half of the flip.   Usually, the appraised  value was\n\nvery close to the intended sale price.  Dolber \"appraised  at the\n\nvalue needed, so we [Rate Line] continued to use her.\"  \n\n             There was  ample evidence upon  which the jury  could\n\nconclude that  Dolber frequently misstated the  conditions of the\n\nappraised properties, making them  appear more valuable than they\n\nwere.  Thus, in her  appraisal of 69 Turner Street, Dolber  wrote\n\nthat  the  property  was in  need  of  \"cosmetic  and minor  roof\n\nrepair,\" the  bathrooms were \"fully functioning,\"  the \"[k]itchen\n\ncabinets  are adequate,\" \"two units are rented at this time,\" and\n\nthe third  unit \"will be occupied  by the owner.\"   She rated the\n\nproperty's functional  utility as \"average.\"    Strangis, who was\n\nthe final  purchaser and  was present during  Dolber's appraisal,\n\ntestified that the property was \"[b]asically a shell of a house,\"\n\nand it was not occupied at the time of her inspection or any time\n\nsince.  \n\n                  It had a lot  of broken windows . .\n             . .  The porch  was broken off, a couple\n             of  the gutters were  gone.   The inside\n             had had no plumbing.  Most of the wiring\n             was  gone; whatever was  still there was\n             hanging out of  the ceiling. . . .  [I]f\n\n                               -13-\n                                13\n\n             there  were  any tubs  and  toilets were\n             left  in they  were turned  upside down.\n             There were no stoves, no cabinets. . . .\n\n                  It was nowhere near liveable. . . .\n             A lot of the places didn't have doors.\n\n             In her appraisal  of 34 Harvard Street, Dolber  wrote\n\nthat  \"[a]ll  three units  are rented  at  this time.\"   Monteiro\n\ntestified that  none of the units  was rented at the  time of the\n\nappraisal.    Dolber  described  the  property  as  having  \"been\n\nmaintained in  average to  good condition,\" with  \"all mechanical\n\nand electrical  services [] fully functioning.\"  Martin Pina, the\n\nfinal  purchaser of this property, testified that it was \"in very\n\nbad condition.  There was no plumbing, no pipes, no copper at all\n\nin the  building, it  had been  stripped out.   The  building was\n\nbeing  used by drug users.  There  were syringes on the inside of\n\nthe building. .  . .  [T]here  was a lot of  structural damage on\n\nthe inside.\"  Although Dolber certified in her appraisal that she\n\n\"personally inspected the subject property, both inside and out,\"\n\nMonteiro  and DeNunzio  testified that  Dolber never  entered the\n\npremises  during her  appraisal, and  Dolber admitted as  much to\n\nDeNunzio.    Furthermore,  Dolber  wrote that  the  property  was\n\ndivided into three units, but Pires testified that there were six\n\nunits.  Dolber described 11 Lebanon Street as needing \"only minor\n\ncosmetic  repair\"  and  that  it  \"appear[e]d  to  be  in average\n\ncondition.\"  Monteiro testified that all of the copper pipes were\n\nremoved  from within  the house  and that  both the  interior and\n\nexterior  of the house were  in poor condition.   Dolber reported\n\n                               -14-\n                                14\n\nthat  there were no units vacant, but Monteiro testified that the\n\nproperty  was  unoccupied  at  the time  of  appraisal.    George\n\nStrangis  testified that there was \"no  plumbing in the basement,\n\nit  had been  all ripped out,\"  only one  of the  three hot water\n\nheaters stood upright, and  it was not connected, \"the  other two\n\nwere  laying on their side,\" \"[t]he bathroom ceiling on the first\n\nfloor . . . had  been partially ripped down,\" and  \"[t]he heating\n\nsystems weren't operational.\"  \n\n             Dolber   made  similar  misstatements  regarding  the\n\ncondition  and  occupancy  of  other  properties  she  appraised.\n\nAlthough she stated that  three units at 18 Winthrop  Street were\n\nrented at  the time, Fred  Strangis and  Frank Andrews  testified\n\nthat only  one  of  the  four  units was  then  rented.    Dolber\n\ndescribed 23 Temple Street as having \"been  maintained in average\n\nto good  condition\" with \"all mechanical  and electrical services\n\n[] fully functioning,\" and  reported that \"[a]ll three  units are\n\nrented  at this time.\"   Martin Pina, however,  testified that at\n\nthe  time of  the appraisal the  property was boarded  up, had no\n\nelectricity, the  plumbing had  been  \"filled with  some type  of\n\nEthyl  glycol or  antifreeze to  stop the  pipes from  bursting,\"\n\nthere was no water, and nobody lived in the building.  Dolber\n\nalso  repeatedly  appraised  multiple  properties  for  the  same\n\npurchaser, and  each time  reported that the  particular property\n\nwould be owner-occupied.   Thus, in her appraisals she  certified\n\nthat Fred  Strangis would  occupy four properties,  Griffin would\n\n                               -15-\n                                15\n\noccupy two, Andrews would occupy two, and Peter Pina would occupy\n\nthree.  \n\n             The  appraisal form required the appraiser to compare\n\nthe  subject   property  with  recent  sale   prices  of  similar\n\nproperties in  the neighborhood,  which are known  as \"comparable\n\nsales.\"   In  her  appraisals, Dolber  relied  on data  from  the\n\npublication County Comps, which listed the sale prices for closed\n                        \n\nsales,  as a source of information about comparable sales.  Thus,\n\nfor  example, in her appraisal of 79-81 Keith Street, Dolber used\n\nthree comparable sales  and identified County  Comps as her  data\n                                                    \n\nsource.  \n\n             The County Comps she relied on, however, showed  that\n                             \n\neach of the properties she used as comparable sales had been sold\n\ntwice  within  a  short   period  for  vastly  different  prices.\n\nSimilarly, in her appraisal  of 85 Ford Street, Dolber  relied on\n\nCounty Comps for her  comparable sales.  County Comps  showed one\n                                                     \n\nof those properties as involving two sales on the  same day, with\n\nthe second price more than double the first price. \n\n             Dolber's actions  in  connection  with  her  proposed\n\nacquisition of 30-32 Water Street showed her awareness of how the\n\nfraudulent   scheme  was   operating  and   her   willingness  to\n\nparticipate  in it.  She asked DeNunzio  to handle a loan for her\n\non  the property and proposed that her nephew, Adam Belanger, and\n\nhis wife, Karen,  serve as  straw buyers since  Dolber had a  bad\n\ncredit rating.   After DeNunzio  told Dolber  that the  Belangers\n\nwould not  qualify for a  loan because they  did not earn  enough\n\n                               -16-\n                                16\n\nmoney, Dolber told DeNunzio that she would give Karen a job,  and\n\nasked how much  salary Karen  needed to earn  to qualify for  the\n\nloan.\n\n             Dolber  sent DeNunzio  a  verification  of employment\n\nform  for  Karen  from  Whitinsville  Water  Company,  a  company\n\nDolber's  father owned,  which  was \"blank  where the  employment\n\nnumbers  should have  been filled in  on the form.\"   Dolber told\n\nDeNunzio to fill in the blanks, but when he told her he could not\n\ndo that, she undertook to do so.  Thereafter, DeNunzio received a\n\ncompleted verification-of-employment form, a W-2 statement, and a\n\npay   stub  for   Karen  Belanger.     Both   Samuel  Carpinetti,\n\nWhitinsville Water Company's general manager, and Karen  Belanger\n\ntestified that Karen never worked for the company.            \n\n             Dolber  argues  that  the  government's proof  failed\n\nbecause  it  did not  establish  the  appraised properties'  fair\n\nmarket value.   She cites no  precedent, however, and we  know of\n\nnone, that requires the government to prove a precise fair market\n\nvalue as an element of the crime of wire fraud.  To the contrary,\n\nshe notes that \"market value was not in and of  itself an element\n\nof the offenses with which Ms. Dolber was charged.\"  Furthermore,\n\nthe evidence justified a jury conclusion that Dolber's appraisals\n\nfalsely represented the  condition and thereby  the value of  the\n\nproperties.\n\n             Again, citing no case law to support her  contention,\n\nDolber  argues that \"the  jury was left  to speculate  as to what\n\nconduct on the part of Ms. Dolber was inappropriate,\" because the\n\n                               -17-\n                                17\n\ngovernment  did not point to any code of professional ethics that\n\ngoverned  her behavior.  Violation by the  defendant of a code of\n\nethics is not an element of the crime of wire fraud.     \n\n             Dolber  presented   a  version  of  the  facts  which\n\nportrayed her  as  an innocent  victim  of DeNunzio's  scheme  to\n\ndefraud the  lenders.  The foregoing evidence, and other evidence\n\nwe have not discussed,  however, provided the jury with  an ample\n\nbase  for  rejecting  Dolber's  claim, and  concluding  that  she\n\ncommitted wire fraud and aided and abetted its commission.\n\nB.           The Conspiracy Convictions\n                                       \n\n             To  prove  that   a  defendant  is  a  member  of   a\n\nconspiracy, the  government must demonstrate  beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that: 1) the defendant agreed to commit an unlawful act, 2)\n\nthe defendant voluntarily participated in the scheme,  and 3) one\n\nof the conspirators took an affirmative step toward achieving the\n\nconspiracy's purpose.  Braverman  v. United States, 317  U.S. 49,\n                                                  \n\n53 (1942); United States  v. Gomez-Pabon, 911 F.2d 847,  852 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir.  1990), cert. denied sub  nom. Guzman v.  United States, 498\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 1074  (1991).  To  prove that  a defendant \"belonged  to and\n\nparticipated in the conspiracy,  the government [must] prove that\n\nhe  intended  to  agree  and  that  he  intended  to  commit  the\n\nsubstantive  offense.\"  United States v. Nueva, 979 F.2d 880, 884\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1615 (1993).\n                             \n\n             \"[C]onspiratorial agreement  need not  be express  so\n\nlong  as  its  existence  can  plausibly  be  inferred  from  the\n\ndefendants'  words   and  actions  and   the  interdependence  of\n\n                               -18-\n                                18\n\nactivities and  persons involved.\"  United States  v. Boylan, 898\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  230, 241-42  (1st Cir.  1990), cert.  denied, 498  U.S. 849\n                                                  \n\n(1990)  (citations omitted).   Evidence  of participation  in the\n\nconspiracy    may    include    \"inferences   from    surrounding\n\ncircumstances,  such  as acts  committed  by  the defendant  that\n\nfurthered the  conspiracy's purposes.\"  Gomez-Pabon,  911 F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n853.   Furthermore, the government is under no duty to prove that\n\nthe  defendant knew each of  the objectives of  the conspiracy or\n\nall the details.  Id.\n                     \n\n              Pezzullo and  Dolber do  not deny  that there  was a\n\nconspiracy to commit wire  fraud, and the record leaves  no doubt\n\nthat one existed.   They argue, however, that the  government did\n\nnot  prove that they joined the conspiracy.  Evidence relating to\n\nthe substantive  offenses discussed  in Part II.A,  also supports\n\nthe jury  verdict of  conspiracy.   Moreover,  once the  evidence\n\nestablishes the  existence of  a conspiracy, lesser  evidence may\n\nsuffice  to  show  a  defendant's  connection  with  the  overall\n\nconspiracy.   United States v. Smith, 726 F.2d 852, 866 (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1984). \n\n             As shown  above, Pezzullo was  aware that the  second\n\npurchasers did  not themselves provide  the down payments  on the\n\nmarket price, although required to so do  by the HUD-1 forms that\n\nshe  and Cassiere  had them  sign.   She also  saw that  the same\n\nindividuals  repeatedly  attended  closings  on  properties  they\n\ncertified  would  be  owner-occupied.    She  was  aware  of  the\n\nsignificant differences in  the prices  of the two  sales in  the\n\n                               -19-\n                                19\n\nland flips.  At  the first flip Cassiere discussed  with Pezzullo\n\nprior sales of 59-61  Howard Street.  Pezzullo had done the title\n\nwork for  that closing, and  Cassiere was interested  in learning\n\nwhat the earlier sale prices were to see if he  could justify the\n\nhigher price to be paid in the double closing.  \n\n             An  inference  could  have  been  drawn  that  Dolber\n\nfollowed Monteiro's wishes that her appraisals support the higher\n\nsales prices in the  second flips.  She repeatedly  misstated the\n\ncondition and occupancy of  the properties she appraised, thereby\n\nincreasing  the amounts the lenders would loan on the security of\n\nthe  properties.   Dolber's  use of  her nephew  and his  wife as\n\nstraws in an  attempt to purchase 30-32 Water  Street for her was\n\nfurther  evidence that she was aware of how DeNunzio and Monteiro\n\nconducted illegal property sales.\n\n             Don  Peters,  of First  Union  Mortgage  Corporation,\n\nbecame suspicious about an appraisal that Dolber had conducted on\n\na mortgage First Union purchased from Rate Line.  He asked Dolber\n\nto explain the  apparent increase  in the value  of the  property\n\nwithin  one day  which he  noted from  his review  of Banker  and\n\nTradesmen,  a  listing  of  property values  and  closing  dates.\n\nDolber called DeNunzio, told him of her conversation with Peters,\n\nand asked, \"what's that all about?\"  \n\n             In a  subsequent conversation,  DeNunzio told  Dolber\n\nthat he  had checked  out the  situation, that  there had been  a\n\nprior foreclosure sale, but  that she would not have  known about\n\nit because  that sale had not  been recorded at the  time she did\n\n                               -20-\n                                20\n\nthe appraisal.  When Dolber told him that Peters had requested  a\n\nwritten  response, DeNunzio told her that he wanted to review the\n\nletter  before she sent  it out.  The  letter Dolber wrote Peters\n\nprovided an  explanation similar  to the  one DeNunzio had  given\n\nher:   the low  first sale  price was  due to  the fact that  the\n\nproperty was purchased from foreclosure, and thus did not reflect\n\nthe true  market value.  At the time she conducted her appraisal,\n\nnone of her data sources mentioned that sale.  \n\n             On another occasion Dolber called DeNunzio and  asked\n\nhim  to meet her outside  a bar but  refused to tell  him why she\n\nwanted  to  do  so.    He  met  her  there  and  they  had  their\n\nconversation inside her  car.   Dolber told him  that she  needed\n\nphotographs of  four of  the properties  she had appraised  since\n\nMonteiro,  and not she, had taken the photographs.  She explained\n\nthat she needed  the pictures  in her records,  which the  United\n\nStates government had requested.   He agreed to provide  her with\n\nthe pictures.  \n\n             The evidence  supports the jury finding that Pezzullo\n\nand Dolber were knowing and willing participants in a  conspiracy\n\nto  defraud the  lending  institutions.   The  government is  not\n\nrequired  to prove that each co-conspirator  knew every detail of\n\nthe scheme; \"[a]ll  that is  required is to  show 'the  essential\n\nnature  of  the plan  and their  connections  with it.'\"   United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v.

Questions Asked By the Jurors\n\n             At  the beginning  of the  trial, before  any  of the\n\nattorneys  had made opening  statements, the court  told the jury\n\nthat it could ask  the witnesses questions.  The  court explained\n\nthat  the questions had to be written; that the written questions\n\nwould be submitted  to the  court, which would  review them;  and\n\nthat  the court  might not ask  a jury  question if  the question\n\ncould not be  put in a proper legal form or it \"couldn't make any\n\nlegal difference at  all.\"   During the 24-day  trial, the  court\n\nasked  the  witnesses  eleven   questions  that  the  jurors  had\n\nsubmitted.\n\n             The defendants did not object to the court  following\n\nthe  practice thus to ask questions or, indeed, to any particular\n\nquestion asked.  \"In the absence of a timely objection our review\n\nis  limited to examining the record  for plain error, and we will\n\ncorrect only particularly  egregious errors . .  . that seriously\n\naffect the  fairness, integrity or public  reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.\"   United States v.  Munson, 819 F.2d  337, 340 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir. 1987) (internal quotations omitted).\n\n             In  United States v. Sutton, 970 F.2d  1001 (1st Cir.\n                                        \n\n1992), decided after the trial in the present case, we upheld the\n\nactions  of the same district judge in employing this practice in\n\na  mail  and wire  fraud prosecution,  in  which the  court asked\n\nwitnesses seven questions submitted by the jurors.   We held that\n\n                               -22-\n                                22\n\n\"especially in complex cases,\" \"allowing juror-inspired questions\n\nin  a criminal case  is not prejudicial  per se, but  is a matter\n                                               \n\ncommitted  to the sound  discretion of the trial  court.\"  Id. at\n                                                             \n\n1005.  We noted  that other circuits similarly had  so concluded.\n\nId.   \n  \n\n             We  explained   that  \"[a]llowing   jurors  to   pose\n\nquestions during a  criminal trial  is a  procedure fraught  with\n\nperils.   In most cases, the  game will not be  worth the candle.\n\nNevertheless, we are fully committed  to the principle that trial\n\njudges  should be  given wide  latitude to  manage trials.\"   Id.\n                                                                \n\nAlthough we stated  that \"in most situations,  the risks inherent\n\nin the practice will outweigh its utility,\" we held that we would\n\nreview  the propriety  of the  practice on  a  case-by-case basis\n\nbased on the totality of the circumstances.  Id.\n                                                \n\n             In  Sutton,  we  held  that  for  four  reasons,  the\n                       \n\ncourt's asking of the  juror questions was not  reversible error.\n\nFirst,  Sutton  \"neither objected  nor  requested  any additional\n\nsafeguards.\"  Id.  at 1006.   Second, \"[b]ecause  [Sutton] was  a\n                                                         \n\nfactually complex  case in  which a greater-than-average  risk of\n\njury  confusion existed,  the positive  value of  allowing juror-\n\ninspired questioning was relatively high.\"  Id.  Third, the court\n                                               \n\nused appropriate  procedural safeguards,  such as  requiring that\n\nthe questions be presented in writing to the court and explaining\n\nto the jury  that the  court might not  ask all juror  questions.\n\nId.  Fourth,  \"the questions  themselves were few  in number  and\n   \n\nbland in character.\"  Id. (footnote omitted). \n                         \n\n                               -23-\n                                23\n\n             The first  three reasons  unquestionably are  equally\n\napplicable  here:      the  defendants  did  not  object  to  the\n\nquestioning,  the  case  was  factually complex,  and  the  court\n\nadopted  procedural  safeguards  nearly  identical  to  those  in\n\nSutton.\n      \n\n             Sutton involved seven jury  questions the court asked\n                   \n\nduring  a 2  1/2 day  trial.   The  present case  involves eleven\n\nquestions  asked  during a  24-day trial.    The issue,  thus, is\n\nwhether  this   significantly  larger  number  of   questions  so\n\nseriously undermined  the fairness of the trial  as to constitute\n\nplain error.  We answer that question negatively.\n\n             The juror questions  the court asked  were relatively\n\n\"bland in character,\"  id., and designed  to clarify and  explain\n                         \n\ntestimony already  given.   For  example, one  juror wanted  Paul\n\nPires  to identify the word that followed his signature on one of\n\nthe exhibits.   The word was \"Pres.\"  Another  juror wanted Nancy\n\nRullo to explain  what the \"preliminary title\" that  she referred\n\nto in her testimony meant.  One juror sought clarification of who\n\nhad  done the appraisal the witness was discussing.  Although the\n\ndefendants have objected  to allowing juror questions  and to the\n\nnumber  asked in  this case,  they have  not now argued  that any\n\nspecific question was improper.                     Other   courts\n\nof appeals have upheld convictions where the  court asked varying\n\nnumbers  of questions that the jurors proposed.  In United States\n                                                                 \n\nv.  Lewin,  900  F.2d  145  (8th  Cir.  1990),  the  court,  over\n         \n\nobjections made in the jury's presence, asked six questions.  The\n\n                               -24-\n                                24\n\nFourth Circuit upheld a conviction in which the trial court asked\n\nninety-five   juror   questions   during   a   three-week  trial.\n\nDeBenedetto v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 754 F.2d 512 (4th Cir.\n                                         \n\n1985).   The  Fifth  Circuit approved  the  asking of  one  juror\n\nquestion.  United States  v. Callahan, 588 F.2d 1078  (5th Cir.),\n                                     \n\ncert. denied, 444 U.S. 826 (1979).\n            \n\n             In  each  of these  cases the  court  focused on  the\n\neffect  of  the  questions  on  the  trial,  not  the  number  of\n\nquestions, in and of itself.  Thus, the Lewin court  approved the\n                                             \n\nasking of juror questions because they were factual in nature and\n\nmerely \"sought  clarification of  previous testimony and  did not\n\nintroduce new or unrelated subject matter.\"  900 F.2d at 148.  In\n\nDeBenedetto,  despite the  large number  of questions,  the court\n           \n\n\"examined  carefully  each of  the  questions  propounded by  the\n\njurors and [] perceive[d] no bias  in any of the questions.\"  754\n\nF.2d at 517.      In   Sutton,   we  noted   that  \"juror-inspired\n                             \n\nquestioning  becomes particularly troublesome  when questions are\n\ndirected at the [criminal] defendant.\"  970 F.2d at 1006 n.6.  In\n\nSutton,  the court asked only one such question of the defendant.\n      \n\nId.\n   \n\n             In the  present case, the  court asked the  defendant\n\nCassiere four juror questions  during his testimony which spanned\n\nthree days.  Here, as in Sutton, the \"appellant did not object to\n                               \n\n[the  questions]; and  he has  not argued  on appeal  that th[ese\n\nquestions  were] improper or  harmful.\"  Id.   We cannot say that\n                                           \n\nthe  district court committed plain error in asking the defendant\n\n                               -25-\n                                25\n\nCassiere four relatively benign juror questions during Cassiere's\n\nthree days of testifying.\n\n             The  defendants  argue, however,  that by  asking the\n\njury  questions during the testimony  of the witnesses, the court\n\nimproperly interfered  with their  ability to conduct  direct and\n\ncross-examination of the witnesses.  The district court, however,\n\nhas broad discretion to  control trial proceedings.  Id.  at 1005\n                                                       \n\n(\"we are  fully  committed to  the  principle that  trial  judges\n\nshould be given wide latitude to manage trials\"); see also United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.  Slone, 833  F.2d 595, 597  (6th Cir. 1987)  (The court\n                \n\n\"must see that the issues are not obscured and that the testimony\n\nis not misunderstood.\").   While objections from opposing counsel\n\nand   sidebars   may  be   similarly   disruptive  of   counsel's\n\nexamination, they are interruptions that are also critical to the\n\nfair and rational progression  of the trial.  We  cannot say that\n\nthe court's asking  of the jurors'  questions so interfered  with\n\ncounsels'  questioning of the witnesses as to constitute a denial\n\nof the defendants' right to a fair trial.\n\n             Although  we uphold  the district  court's asking the\n\njuror questions in this case, we reiterate what we said in Sutton\n                                                                 \n\nregarding the use of this practice.   As we there indicated,  the\n\npractice  should  be  reserved for  exceptional  situations,  and\n\nshould  not become  the  routine, even  in  complex cases.    The\n\ndistrict court   should inform  counsel at the  earliest possible\n\ntime of its intention to use this technique and allow counsel the\n\nopportunity to object.  The court should instruct the jurors that\n\n                               -26-\n                                26\n\nthey should limit  their questions to  important points, that  at\n\ntimes the rules of evidence will dictate that the court not ask a\n\nquestion, and that the jurors should draw no implication from the\n\ncourt's failure to  pose a juror-proposed  question to the  jury.\n\nThe jurors should reduce their questions to writing and pass them\n\nto the court.  Before asking a question, the court should offer a\n\nsidebar  conference to  give counsel  the opportunity  to object.\n\nFinally, in its  charge, the court should include  a prophylactic\n\ninstruction, along the lines suggested in Sutton.\n                                                \n\n                     IV.

Admission of the Publication County Comps\n                                                      \n\n             Dolber challenges  the  court's  admission  of  seven\n\nreports from the publication County Comps.  \n                                         \n\n             Federal  Rule  of  Evidence  803(17)  allows,  as  an\n\nexception  to  the  hearsay  rule,  the  admission  of  \"[m]arket\n\nquotations,  tabulations, lists, directories,  or other published\n\ncompilations,  generally used and relied upon by the public or by\n\npersons in particular occupations.\"\n\n             County   Comps   publishes   a  monthly   listing  of\n                           \n\nproperties sold, the sales  prices, and the dates the  sales were\n\nclosed.   Real estate  brokers, insurance agents,  and appraisers\n\nbuy  County  Comps.    The  operating  manager  of  County  Comps\n                                                                 \n\n                               -27-\n                                27\n\ntestified  that  the reports  admitted  were  authentic.

And in  addition to being  aware of\n                  the  responsibilities as  a closing\n                  attorney, sir, you  as an  attorney\n                  have  certain  responsibilities  in\n                  conjunction    with    representing\n                  anybody, right?\n\n             A.   Yes.\n\n             Q.   And      those      duties      and\n                  responsibilities  are set  forth in\n                  such things as  a canon of  ethics,\n                  are they not?\n\n             Cassiere objected  and, after  a sidebar  conference,\n\nthe court overruled the objection and explained:\n\n                               -28-\n                                28\n\n             I'm  going to  be  very  express [in  my\n             charge] that sloppy  or careless work is\n             not  criminal.   It may  be malpractice,\n             but it's not criminal.  But I've decided\n             .  .  .  that  the  failure  to  make  a\n             disclosure of material fact when under a\n             duty to make a disclosure which  duty is\n             known to the  individual with a specific\n             intent to defraud by failing to make the\n             disclosure  constitutes  a violation  of\n             the statute.      \n\n             The questioning continued:\n\n             Q.

You're aware of, you were  aware in\n                  June  of  1990 of  these  things as\n                  well, I gather?\n\n             A.   I don't know what you mean by these\n                  things.\n\n             Q.   The canons of ethics?\n\n             A.   Yes.\n\n             Q,   The disciplinary rules?\n\n             A.   Yes.\n\n                               -29-\n                                29\n\n             Q.   And  you  recognized  that   as  an\n                  attorney  you  were  under  certain\n                  obligations?\n\n             A.   Under certain obligations, yes.\n\n             Q.   Those     obligations     included,\n                  included a\n                  responsibility to act truthfully?\n\n             A.   Uh-huh.\n\n             Q.   And honestly?\n\n             A.   Correct.\n\n             Q.   And disclose certain information?\n\n             A.   I  don't  know  what  you  mean  by\n                  disclose certain information.\n\n             The  court  then  sustained  an  objection  and   the\n\nprosecutor moved on.  \n\n             To comprehend Cassiere's role in this scheme, it  was\n\nimportant for  the jury  to  understand how  Cassiere and  others\n\nviewed his duties as  a closing attorney and whether  he believed\n\nhe had violated those duties.  These facts were important for the\n\njury in determining  whether his participation  in the scheme  to\n\ndefraud his  clients, the  lending institutions,  was intentional\n\nand  knowing.  The district court has discretion to determine the\n\nscope of cross-examination,   United States  v.

Cassiere  testified  that he  also\n\nrelied  on  those  deeds,  which  listed  past  sale  prices,  as\n\nindications of the value of the property at the time he conducted\n\nthe title searches.\n\n             The  court excluded  these deeds  \"on the  ground  of\n\nrelevance  [because] they're  [sic] conveyance  is too  remote in\n\ntime given, and I take judicial notice at the side bar of the . .\n\n. marked decline  in real estate values within the period of time\n\nand material to  this lawsuit.\"   The court  allowed Cassiere  to\n\ntestify  that these deeds formed the basis of his conclusion that\n\nthe  second sale prices in the land  flips were justified.  Since\n\nthe deeds were for sales that occurred four  to five years before\n\nthose at issue in the case, and since the evidence was cumulative\n\nto Cassiere's testimony, the  court did not abuse  its discretion\n\nin excluding the deeds.  \n\nD.           Admission of Evidence Under Rule 404(b)\n                                                    \n\n             Pezzullo   challenges  the  court's  admission  under\n\nFederal Rule  of Evidence  404(b) of  evidence concerning  a real\n\nestate transaction not charged in the indictment.   Dolber argues\n\nthat the  court  erred  in admitting  under  that  rule  evidence\n\nconcerning a similar transaction and a tape recorded conversation\n\nbetween herself and DeNunzio.\n\n             1.   The Two  Land  Transactions Not  Charged in  The\n                                                                  \n\n                  Indictment\n                            \n\n                               -31-\n                                31\n\n             Cassiere  entered  into  negotiations  with  Hybernia\n\nSavings bank to buy 23 Newark Street, which the bank recently had\n\nforeclosed.  Pezzullo signed a purchase and sales  agreement with\n\nthe bank for $65,000.   Cassiere offered to sell  the property to\n\nRobert Felicio and Richard Rego.  His plan was to pay Felicio and\n\nRego  to renovate the property and, thus, provide them with money\n\nfor their down payment.   Before work was begun on  the property,\n\nCassiere had Felicio and  Rego inquire of Rate Line  whether they\n\ncould qualify for a mortgage loan.\n\n             Cassiere  told DeNunzio  that he was  structuring the\n\nsale as a \"no money down flip.\"  After receiving loan information\n\nfrom Felicio and  Rego at  the law firm,  Monteiro told  DeNunzio\n\nthat he  was upset  that Felicio  and Rego  \"were sitting in  the\n\noffice along  with  Joe Cassiere  [and] were  making jokes  about\n\nGlenn Monteiro looking the  other way in regards to  processing a\n\nloan the way it should be.\"\n\n             Cassiere  and  Pezzullo decided  that they  would not\n\nmake enough  profit on the resale  so they told  Felicio that the\n\ndeal  was off.    Cassiere  later  negotiated a  second  purchase\n\nagreement with  Hybernia for $35,000.   DeNunzio asked  Dolber to\n\nappraise  the property, which she  valued at $157,000.   The same\n\nmonth, Pezzullo purchased the property for $35,000.  \n\n             Dolber also  sought to buy  property on Water  Street\n\nusing her nephew and his wife as straw buyers due to her own poor\n\ncredit  rating.  See II.A above.   The loan fell through when the\n                    \n\nlender refused to do any more business with DeNunzio.  \n\n                               -32-\n                                32\n\n             2.   The Tape Recording\n                                    \n\n             Following  inquiries  by  the  lending  institutions,\n\nDeNunzio tape-recorded several telephone conversations.  After an\n\nevidentiary hearing, the court admitted a tape containing a phone\n\nconversation between  Dolber and DeNunzio.   The conversation was\n\nshort,  and  according  to  DeNunzio was  recorded  by  accident,\n\nbecause the  call from Dolber came in on his call waiting service\n\nwhile  he was conducting another conversation that he was taping.\n\nOnce  DeNunzio  finished with  each  conversation  he turned  the\n\nrecorder off  and back  on again to  record his own  statement of\n\nwhen  and  with whom  the conversation  had  taken place.   After\n\nrecording  this information,  he clicked  Dolber back  in through\n\ncall waiting and recorded his conversation with her.\n\n             In  that  conversation,  Dolber  told  DeNunzio  that\n\nalthough  Karen  Belanger  did  not work  at  Whitinsville  Water\n\nCompany,   they  could   fill  in   the  appropriate   employment\n\nverification  forms as though she did, and at whatever salary was\n\nnecessary.  The recording was cut off abruptly at the end.  \n\n             3.   Admissibility of the Evidence\n                                               \n\n                  (a)   Prior to  reviewing the  court's admission\n\nof the  foregoing evidence under  Rule 404(b), we  must determine\n\nwhether the making  of the tape recording  was legal, and if  so,\n\nwhether   the  government  adequately   demonstrated  the  tape's\n\nauthenticity.   \n\n             Title  18   of  the   United  States  Code,   section\n\n2511(2)(d) provides:\n\n                               -33-\n                                33\n\n                  It shall not be unlawful under this\n             chapter  for a  person not  acting under\n             color of law to  intercept a wire, oral,\n             or  electronic communication  where such\n             person is a  party to the communications\n             or  where one  of  the  parties  to  the\n             communication has given prior consent to\n             such     interception    unless     such\n             communication  is  intercepted  for  the\n             purpose  of  committing any  criminal or\n             tortious   act   in  violation   of  the\n             Constitution  or  laws  of   the  United\n             States or of any State.\n\n18 U.S.C.   2511(2)(d) (1988).\n\n             A  defendant seeking  to  suppress a  tape  recording\n\n\"bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence,\"\n\nUnited States v.  Vest, 639 F.  Supp. 899,  907 (D. Mass.  1986),\n                      \n\naff'd, 813 F.2d 477 (1st Cir. 1987), either \"(1) that the primary\n     \n\nmotivation, or  (2) that  a determinative  factor in the  actor's\n\nmotivation  for intercepting  the  conversation was  to commit  a\n\ncriminal, tortious, or other injurious act.\"  Id. at 904.    \n                                                 \n\n             After an  evidentiary  hearing,  the  district  court\n\nruled  that it was \"not persuaded  by a fair preponderance of the\n\nevidence that Mr. DeNunzio made the recording of Ms. Dolber for a\n\ncriminal, tortious or injurious purpose; at most, the Court finds\n\nthat  if anything  Mr. DeNunzio  made the  tape recording  of the\n\nconversation  in  order  to   prevent  future  distortions  by  a\n\nparticipant.\"  The court concluded that DeNunzio did not make the\n\ntape to  blackmail  Dolber or  as  part of  a  conspiracy.   This\n\nfactual  finding  reflecting  the  court's familiarity  with  the\n\nevidence  and  its  evaluation  of witness  credibility,  is  not\n\nclearly erroneous. \n\n                               -34-\n                                34\n\n             After the evidentiary  hearing, the court found  that\n\nthe government had established a proper foundation for the tape's\n\nauthenticity.    Dolber challenges  that  conclusion  because she\n\nviews  DeNunzio's  testimony  as  inconsistent,  incredible,  and\n\nsuspect.  Credibility determinations  are for the district court,\n\nand Dolber does not show that the finding was clearly erroneous.\n\n             (b)  Rule 404(b) provides:\n\n             Evidence  of  other  crimes, wrongs,  or\n             acts  is not  admissible  to  prove  the\n             character of  a person in order  to show\n             action in conformity therewith.

The  Water Street  transaction was  probative of  Dolber's\n\nknowledge and intent in  two significant ways.  Unlike  the other\n\nland flips,  in which she  served only  as an appraiser,  in this\n\ninstance Dolber was  involved in  an actual attempt  to obtain  a\n\nmortgage  loan.     The  evidence   showed  Dolber's   submitting\n\nfraudulent documents concerning Karen Belanger's employment.\n\n             The  Newark  Street transaction  reflected Pezzullo's\n\nfunctioning  in  a different  role from  that  in the  other land\n\nflips.     Here,  Cassiere  and  Pezzullo,  and  not  Rate  Line,\n\nmasterminded  the   flip  and   intended  to  buy   the  property\n\nthemselves.  This evidence  was probative of Pezzullo's knowledge\n\nof how a flip was arranged.                        The        tape\n\nrecording was  probative of Dolber's knowledge  concerning how to\n\ngo about defrauding a lender.\n\n                               -36-\n                                36\n\n             All of this  evidence thus satisfied the first  prong\n\nof the rule 404(b)  test, since it had \"some  'special' probative\n\nvalue showingintent, preparation,knowledge or absenceof mistake.\"\n\nGarcia, 983 F.2d at 1172.\n      \n\n             On the  second prong  of the rule 404(b)  test, \"[w]e\n\nafford  'considerable leeway' to a district court in its Rule 403\n\nbalancing, and we will reverse a  district court's balancing only\n\nin  'exceptional   circumstances.'\"     Id.  at   1173  (internal\n                                          \n\nquotations  and citations  omitted);  see also  United States  v.\n                                                                 \n\nZeuli,   725  F.2d  813,  816  (1st  Cir.  1984)  (\"the  test  of\n     \n\nadmissibility is committed  primarily to the trial  court\").

Such a\n             scheme in each case has to be reasonably\n             calculated  to  deceive   a  lender   of\n             ordinary  prudence,  ordinary  care  and\n             comprehension.\n\n             The court also instructed:\n\n             [I]t   is  not  a  crime  simply  to  be\n             careless or sloppy  in discharging  your\n             duties   as  an  attorney   or  a[s]  an\n             appraiser.

However,  one  of  the \"elements  that\n\ntransform[s] a  fiduciary breach into mail fraud . . . . is where\n\nthere  is a  recognizable scheme  formed with specific  intent to\n\ndefraud.\"   Id.  This is  equally true for wire  fraud.  Cassiere\n               \n\nadmits  as much  when  he  writes in  his  brief:  \"There may  be\n\ncircumstances  in which  a violation  of a  non-criminal standard\n\nsuch  as the canons of  ethics could conceivably  be probative on\n\nthe issue of whether or not there was fraud.\"  \n\n             Cassiere states  both that the  record is unclear  as\n\nto who his  client was, and  somewhat inconsistently that  \"[h]is\n\nostensible client  was  the bank  writing the  mortgage for  each\n\npiece  of property.\"  The latter statement is correct.  Cassiere,\n\nassisted by his  law partner Pezzullo,  was the closing  attorney\n\nand  represented the lenders, which he acknowledged at trial.  As\n\nattorneys representing  the lenders, Cassiere and  Pezzullo had a\n\nfiduciary  duty  toward them,  which  Cassiere  also admitted  at\n\ntrial.       In United States  v. Silvano, 812 F.2d 754, 759  (1st\n                                         \n\nCir. 1987),  we  held  that  \"the affirmative  duty  to  disclose\n\nmaterial  information  arises  out  of  a  government  official's\n\nfiduciary   relationship  to   his   or  her   employer.\"     Id.\n                                                                 \n\n\"Concealment of  material information by an employee under a duty\n\nto disclose to his or her employer 'under circumstances where the\n\nnon-disclosure  could or does result in harm to [the employer] is\n\n                               -39-\n                                39\n\na violation of the  [mail fraud] statute.'\"  Id.

In its written  instructions to\n\nthe closing attorneys, one lender stated: \"While we have tried to\n\ncover  our  procedures  in  these closing  transactions,  we  are\n\nrelying on your  judgment and  experience as a  closing agent  to\n\nproperly handle and complete our loan closing.

Willful Blindness Instruction\n                                               \n\n             The   defendants   challenge  the   court's   willful\n\nblindness instruction:  \n\n                  Now, the element of  knowledge that\n             I  just mentioned  for Counts  1 through\n             15,   that  may   be  satisfied   by  an\n             inference,  drawn  from proof,  that the\n             particular  person  accused deliberately\n             closed  his or  her  eyes to  what would\n             otherwise  have  been  obvious  to  that\n             person.   You may infer knowledge if you\n             find beyond a  reasonable doubt that the\n             particular person accused refused  to be\n             enlightened, refused to take notice, but\n             only  where you  find the  individual is\n             aware of  a  high probability  that  the\n             fact  exists and where the individual in\n\n                               -40-\n                                40\n\n             his or her own  mind does not believe --\n             strike  that,  does  not disbelieve  the\n             fact  where  there's a  high probability\n             that     the    fact     that's    being\n             misrepresented actually exists and where\n             the  person  in  his  or  her  own  mind\n             doesn't disbelieve that fact.\n\n                  Stated  another   way,  a  person's\n             knowledge may be inferred from a willful\n             blindness to the  existence of the fact.\n             It's entirely up to you whether you find\n             any  deliberate closing of the eyes, any\n             inference   to   be   drawn  from   such\n             evidence.    Remember, though,  evidence\n             showing  negligence  or  mistake is  not\n             enough to  support a finding  of willful\n             blindness.      The  ultimate   fact  of\n             criminal  intent  may be  established by\n             circumstantial   evidence  if   you  are\n             satisfied that  it  is proven  beyond  a\n             reasonable doubt.\n\n                  Caution  is   necessary  in   giving  a  willful\n\nblindness instruction \"'because of  the possibility that the jury\n\nwill  be  led  to employ  a  negligence  standard  and convict  a\n\ndefendant on the  impermissible ground that he  should have known\n\n[an   illegal  act]  was  taking  place.'\"     United  States  v.\n                                                                 \n\nLittlefield, 840  F.2d 143,  148 n.3  (1st Cir.)

A court  properly gives  such an\n      \n\ninstruction when \"a  defendant claims  a lack  of knowledge,  the\n\nfacts suggest a conscious course of deliberate ignorance, and the\n\ninstruction,  taken  as  a  whole,  cannot  be  misunderstood  as\n\nmandating an inference of knowledge.\"  Id. at 147.\n                                          \n\n             The  defendants did  not deny  the existence  of  the\n\nscheme to defraud, but  contended only that they were  unaware of\n\nit.  Furthermore,  the instruction  made it clear  to the  jurors\n\n                               -41-\n                                41\n\nthat  it was  for them  to determine  whether the  defendants had\n\nclosed their eyes to what should have been apparent to them.  The\n\ncourt  three times used the word \"may\" and explained that \"[i]t's\n\nentirely up to you whether you find any deliberate closing of the\n\neyes.\"   See Picciandra, 788 F.2d at 46 (approving an instruction\n                       \n\nthat permitted but did not require the jury to  draw an inference\n\nof willful blindness).    \n\n             Although the  government's main  contention at  trial\n\nwas that  all three defendants  were knowing participants  in the\n\nscheme,  the government  presented evidence  from which  the jury\n\ncould have concluded that if they did not know what was going on,\n\nit was  only because  they chose  to turn a  blind eye.   \"Guilty\n\nknowledge may be inferred where instances of fraud are repeatedly\n\nbrought to a defendant's  attention without prompting  alteration\n\nof  his facilitative conduct.\"  United States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n1110, 1114 (1st Cir.  1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S.  1005 (1990).\n                                         \n\n                       Cassiere  argues that, like the failure-to-\n\ndisclose instruction, this instruction  suggests to the jury that\n\nalthough  \"negligence or  mistake  is  not  enough to  support  a\n\nfinding  of  willful  blindness,  .  .  .  [anything]  more  than\n\nnegligence is enough.\"   Thus, the argument goes, the  jury could\n\nhave  concluded that the breach  of canons of  ethics alone could\n\nconstitute  \"more than negligence,\"  and lead to conviction.  The\n\ninstruction  explained  that   \"evidence  showing  negligence  or\n\nmistake  is not  enough.\"  It  also told  the jury  that it could\n\nconsider  \"any  deliberate closing  of the  eyes.\"   As  with the\n\n                               -42-\n                                42\n\nfailure-to-disclose  instruction, breach  of  a  fiduciary  duty,\n\nalone,  would not  prove willful  blindness, but  the jury  could\n\ninfer   knowledge   if   it   concluded   that   the   defendants\n\n\"deliberately\" closed their  eyes to facts  that they were  duty-\n\nbound to report to the lending institutions.\n\n             Cassiere further  argues that  the willful  blindness\n\ninstruction was \"logically inconsistent  with the Court's  charge\n\non  failure  to  disclose  a  material  fact,\"  and  that  \"[t]he\n\ngovernment  cannot have  it both  ways.\"   The willful  blindness\n\ninstruction,  however,  related to  the defendant's  knowledge of\n\nwhat  occurred.   The  failure-to-disclose charge,  on the  other\n\nhand, instructed  the jury on determining  whether the defendants\n\nwere involved in the scheme to defraud.\n\n             Finally,  Dolber  argues that  the  admission  of the\n\nrule 404(b) evidence  to prove  her knowledge of  the scheme  was\n\ninconsistent with  the government's contention that  she remained\n\nwillfully blind to the scheme.  We know of no authority, however,\n\nthat  prohibits  the  government  from  proceeding  on  alternate\n\ntheories in a criminal case.\n\nB.           Refusal to Define Reasonable Doubt\n                                               \n\n             Cassiere, Pezzullo, and Dolber challenge the  court's\n\ndenial of Dolber's request for an instruction defining reasonable\n\ndoubt.       In United  States v.

We explained that \"[m]ost efforts at clarification result\n\n                               -43-\n                                43\n\nin further obfuscation of the concept,\" id. at 645, and held that\n                                           \n\n\"an  instruction which  uses the  words reasonable  doubt without\n\nfurther  definition adequately  apprises the  jury of  the proper\n\nburden of proof.  This does not mean, of course,  that the phrase\n\ncan be buried  as an aside in the [jury charge].\" Id. at 646.  In\n                                                     \n\nessence, we concluded  that the  district court was  in the  best\n\nposition  to  determine  whether,  and  if   so  how,  to  define\n\nreasonable  doubt.  See also Littlefield, 840 F.2d at 146; United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Rodriguez-Cardona, 924 F.2d  1148, 1160 (1st Cir.)

Ct. 54 (1991).\n\n             There   is  no  suggestion  that   the  reference  to\n\nreasonable doubt was \"buried  as an aside\" in the  court's charge\n\nto the jury.  To the contrary, the court instructed the jury that\n\n\"should  there be any  reasonable doubt of  any essential element\n\nwhich the government has to prove  as to any of these specific 16\n\ncharges,  then the  person or  persons so  charged must  have the\n\nbenefit of that reasonable  doubt and cannot be convicted  on the\n\ncharge or  charges.\"  In  its instructions,  the court  mentioned\n\n\"reasonable doubt\" twenty-four more times.\n\n             The court  did not abuse  its discretion in  refusing\n\nto define reasonable doubt.\n\n             Relying upon Judge Torruella's  concurring opinion in\n\nLittlefield in which he stated that \"I am of the opinion that the\n           \n\n                               -44-\n                                44\n\nfailure to grant an instruction explaining the term 'proof beyond\n\na  reasonable doubt'  is  an error  of constitutional  dimension,\n\nstriking  at the very heart of the presumption of innocence,\" 840\n\nF.2d at 151,  the defendants  urge this court  to reconsider  the\n\nissue  en banc.    In view  of  this court's  settled  precedent,\n              \n\nhowever,   this  panel   sees   no  occasion   to  suggest   such\n\nreconsideration by the full court.\n\nC.

Lucid,  an attorney, was  convicted of\n                \n\naiding  and abetting  Picciandra  in evading  income  taxes.   He\n\nargued  that  a  Maniego  instruction was  required  because  the\n                        \n\ngovernment had  suggested that  Lucid was  culpable in not  going\n\nbeyond what his client had told him.  \n\n             Cassiere  and  Pezzullo  did not  request  a  Maniego\n                                                                  \n\ninstruction at trial and claim on appeal that the court committed\n\nplain error in not  giving such an instruction.

Rather,  the\n\ngovernment  introduced  evidence  of  Cassiere's  and  Pezzullo's\n\nservices as  attorneys representing the lending  institutions and\n\nthe fiduciary duty they owed to those lenders because those facts\n\nwere central to  understanding their  roles in the  scheme.

She  seems  key to  the  successful  operation of  this\n\nfraudulent scheme, just like an attorney is.\"  The lenders relied\n\non  her inflated appraisals  in making their  mortgage loans, and\n\nwithout those appraisals the scheme might not have succeeded. \n\nAlthough DeNunzio, Monteiro, and Cassiere were more culpable than\n\nDolber,  the straw  buyers who  were Dolber's  co-defendants were\n\nrelatively  minor cogs  in  the scheme  to  defraud the  lenders.\n\nThus,   Dolber   was  not   \"less   culpable   than  most   other\n\nparticipants.\"   U.S.S.G.   3B1.2, comment.

The fraud involved an intricate and sophisticated scheme involving a technique known as a \"land flip,\" under which real property is purchased for a low price, immediately resold at a much higher price to a straw or fictitious buyer, and the higher resale price is used as the basis for obtaining a mortgage loan that finances the entire transaction.  One of the defendants also challenges her sentence.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts convicted the defendants Cassiere and Pezzullo of fifteen counts of wire fraud and aiding and abetting wire fraud, and the defendant Dolber of thirteen counts of that crime (it acquitted her on one count), in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343 (1988), and all three defendants of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371 (1988).  The district court sentenced Cassiere to 46 months imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release, Pezzullo to 24 months imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release, and Dolber to 39 months imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release.  Each defendant also was ordered to make restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The substantive crimes for which the three defendants were convicted involved their participation in a scheme to defraud six mortgage lenders through a series of fifteen land flips, in all but one of which the two sales of the property were closed on the same day, often the second immediately following the first.  Cassiere was the senior partner of Pezzullo in a two-person law firm that handled all the closings in the land flip transactions.  Dolber was a real estate appraiser, whose appraisals of the properties were relied on by the mortgage lenders in making their loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rate Line was a mortgage broker which, for a fee, took loan applications and referred them to lenders.  Thomas DeNunzio owned Rate Line, and he and his employee loan broker, Glenn Monteiro, controlled Rate Line.  DeNunzio and Monteiro planned and organized the fraudulent scheme, under which one of three straw corporations they controlled (Half &amp; Half, Inc., ZBA Corp. and Chantel, Inc.) purchased foreclosed property for cash and resold the property on the same day to straw buyers at a much higher price.  Mortgage loan funds received from the lending institutions were used to pay the corporation controlled by Rate Line and that corporation then paid for the first sale.  The balance then went to DeNunzio and Monteiro, channeled through Rate Line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeNunzio and Monteiro pleaded guilty to another indictment and they both testified for the government in the present case.  They described in detail how the scheme operated, the roles Cassiere, Pezzullo, and Dolber played in the scheme, and DeNunzio's and Monteiro's relationship with the three defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An example of the operation of the scheme was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 12, 1991, Half &amp; Half Corporation closed the purchase of property at 104 Menlo Street for $102,900.  Moments later Half &amp; Half closed the sale of the property to Fred Strangis, one of the dummy purchasers, for $228,000.  Dolber previously had appraised the property at $228,000.  Based on this appraisal and Strangis' certification that he would reside at 104 Menlo Street, Rate Line gave Strangis a mortgage loan of $182,400, which was eighty percent of the final sale price.  Rate Line, in turn, sold Strangis' mortgage to CenTrust Mortgage Corporation.  Neither Half and Half nor Strangis brought a down payment to the double closing.  Instead, Monteiro provided a cashier's check for the twenty percent down payment ($45,600) the lender required the purchaser to make.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cassiere and Pezzullo recorded both deeds and disbursed the funds they had received from the lender.  They paid the original owner the $102,900 owed by Half &amp; Half, they paid the closing costs, including attorneys' fees due them, and gave the balance to Monteiro and DeNunzio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cassiere, assisted by Pezzullo, was the closing attorney in each of the double closings.  They represented the interests of the lending institution that was providing, through Rate Line, the mortgage loan to the final buyer.  The closing attorney serves as \"the eyes and ears\" of the lending institution at the closing.  The lenders expected the attorneys to alert them to anything unusual.  Neither Cassiere nor Pezzullo notified any of the six lenders that their law firm was closing twice on the same property on the same day at substantially different prices.  Dolber was the real estate appraiser in thirteen of the flips.  The lending institutions relied on her appraisals to determine the value of the properties upon which they were making loans.  The appraisal alerts the lenders to the property's condition and allows them to determine their ability to recoup their investment should the borrower default on the mortgage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lenders generally made loans of the lesser of eighty percent of the sale price or fair market value of the property.  The six lenders made mortgage loans totalling more than $2.6 million on the properties that were the subject of the land flips involved in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ten of the thirteen appraisals Dolber made of the properties involved in the land flips were for an amount identical to the final sale price, which ranged from $160,000 to $231,000.  (The original sale prices of those properties ranged from $42,000 to $132,000.)   Two of the three other appraisals were for $1,000 higher than the second sale price;  the third was for $2,000 higher.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pezzullo and Dolber, but not Cassiere, challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support their convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing the record in such a challenge, we \"look[ ] to the evidence as a whole, including reasonable inferences drawn from it, in the light most favorable to the verdict, to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  United States v. Plummer, 964 F.2d 1251, 1254 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 350, 121 L.Ed.2d 265 (1992).  \"We do not weigh witness credibility, but resolve all credibility issues in favor of the verdict.  The evidence may be entirely circumstantial and need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence;  that is, the factfinder may decide among reasonable interpretations of the evidence.\"  United States v. Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir.1991) (citations omitted).  Thus viewed, the record supports the convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Wire Fraud Convictions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove wire fraud the government must show:  1) a scheme to defraud by means of false pretenses, 2) the defendant's knowing and willful participation in the scheme with the intent to defraud, and 3) the use of interstate wire communications in furtherance of the scheme.  United States v. Serrano, 870 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1989).  To support convictions of aiding and abetting wire fraud, the government must prove that the \"defendant associated [herself] with the underlying venture, participated in it as something [she] wished to bring about, and sought by [her] actions to make it succeed.\"  United States v. Clifford, 979 F.2d 896, 899 (1st Cir.1992) (citing Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States, 336 U.S. 613, 619, 69 S.Ct. 766, 769, 93 L.Ed. 919 (1949)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither Pezzullo nor Dolber challenges the existence of a scheme to defraud.  The scheme is shown by DeNunzio's and Monteiro's lengthy testimony about the details of their plan to trick the lending institutions into making risky loans that were warranted by neither the final purchaser's ability to repay the loan nor the particular property's true market value.  Pezzullo and Dolber also do not challenge the use of interstate wire communications to effectuate the plan, as demonstrated at trial by testimonial and physical evidence of the use of fax machines and telephone conversations throughout the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pezzullo and Dolber, however, claim that they were unaware of the scheme and therefore were not knowing and willful participants in it.  We hold, however, that the jury reasonably could have concluded from the voluminous evidence at trial that both Pezzullo and Dolber knowingly participated in the scheme with intent to defraud, and also aided and abetted the fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Pezzullo</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pezzullo participated in all the double closings, almost all of which took place at the office of the Cassiere &amp; Pezzullo law firm.  Fred Strangis testified that Pezzullo's role was to \"prepare all the papers and as you're signing them, would bring them to you, try to get you to read them, try to explain them to you.\"   Frank Andrews and Dennis Griffin, two other straw final buyers, and Marlissa Pina, representing one of the controlled corporate purchasers, corroborated Strangis' testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the lending institutions give higher mortgages to individuals who live in the property they buy, Strangis signed Residential Loan Applications and Owner Occupancy Affidavits, which Pezzullo gave him, stating that he intended to occupy the property.  Strangis was the final purchaser of four properties, however, and at closings on December 12, 1990, February 6, 1991, April 12, 1991, and April 15, 1991, he signed forms stating that four different properties would be his primary residence.  Other straw final purchasers similarly signed multiple owner-occupancy documents at the closings:  Peter Pina within one month and a half signed three such forms;  Jeanette Monteiro within a four-month period twice signed such documents;  Dennis Griffin in one month signed two such documents;  and Frank Andrews within three months signed two.  Pezzullo witnessed the signing of each of these documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the lenders required that the purchaser bring a twenty percent down payment to the closing.  Neither the straw buyers making the second purchases nor the corporations making the first purchases brought down payments with them.  Instead, Cassiere or Pezzullo notified Monteiro before the closing of the amount of the down payment and he would bring a cashier's check for that amount to the closing.  Nonetheless, the HUD-1 Settlement Statements that Cassiere filled out at the closings reported that the buyers had brought the money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only function of the officers of the corporations that DeNunzio and Monteiro controlled was to sign legal documents designed to keep Monteiro's and DeNunzio's roles hidden.  Pezzullo, however, was aware that DeNunzio and Monteiro controlled the corporations, since Half &amp; Half used the Cassiere and Pezzullo offices as its corporate address.  At the double closings where each property was first sold and then purchased, neither Cassiere nor Pezzullo told the corporate officers what the documents they were signing meant, or that they were buying and selling real property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pezzullo handled the distribution of the proceeds from the second half of the flip.  The proceeds were \"the difference between the loan amount [from the lender] minus the first sale price, minus any closing costs.\"   After Cassiere and Pezzullo had completed the deeds on the two sales following the double closings, Pezzullo disbursed the funds that came from the final purchaser's mortgage.  Pezzullo gave Monteiro the amount due to the original owner from the first half of the flip, returned the down payments to Monteiro and DeNunzio, and distributed the remaining proceeds to Monteiro and DeNunzio for them to divide.  In addition to distributing the mortgage funds, Pezzullo prepared disbursement sheets noting the funds received and the funds disbursed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paul Pires, as Half &amp; Half's president, first bought and then sold property in nine of the flips.  At each closing, in Pezzullo's presence, he signed a HUD-1 form and a statement certifying that he had received a copy of the HUD-1 form, yet neither Cassiere nor Pezzullo ever gave him that document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">George Gundensen, president of CenTrust Corporation, one of the lending institutions, testified that the closing attorney is expected to fill in all blank spaces in loan documents before having the mortgagor sign the documents.  Some of the final buyers signed forms at the closing, however, that were completely blank.  In fact, Cassiere and Pezzullo discussed in Marlissa Pina's presence that they were asking her to sign a blank document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the lending institutions been informed that the same law firm had closed twice on the same property on the same day and with such wide price disparities, they would have either \"suspend[ed] the loan for further information or cancell[ed] the loan.\"   Because of the large difference between the two sale prices, the lending institution would have believed that it \"would be making a loan on a piece of property, the value for which wouldn't support the amount of the loan being made.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foregoing evidence, together with additional evidence in the record we have not discussed, justified the jury's conclusion that Pezzullo both committed wire fraud and aided and abetted its commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Dolber</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Dolber never participated in the closings, she had a vital role in making the scheme work.  Her appraisal forms, which she submitted to Rate Line, supported the high second sale price and thus resulted in the higher mortgages.  The lenders relied heavily on the accuracy of Dolber's appraisals.  As noted, every appraisal she submitted on the thirteen land flips for properties was identical to the second sale prices, or, in three instances, slightly higher.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeNunzio testified that he wanted to use Dolber as the appraiser because he knew from talking to her that \"she would bring in property values as high as possible,\" and that she \"would use non-arm's length transactions for sales comparisons.\"   By non-arm's length transactions, DeNunzio meant \"that the comparable sales used were not a true sale with a wanting borrower and a wanting seller.\"   Instead, the comparable sales she used often were previous flips that Rate Line had established, and, therefore, did not reflect true market value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Monteiro accompanied Dolber in viewing some of the appraised properties.  He told her of the proposed sale price for the second half of the flip.  Usually, the appraised value was very close to the intended sale price.  Dolber \"appraised at the value needed, so we [Rate Line] continued to use her.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was ample evidence upon which the jury could conclude that Dolber frequently misstated the conditions of the appraised properties, making them appear more valuable than they were.  Thus, in her appraisal of 69 Turner Street, Dolber wrote that the property was in need of \"cosmetic and minor roof repair,\" the bathrooms were \"fully functioning,\" the \"[k]itchen cabinets are adequate,\" \"two units are rented at this time,\" and the third unit \"will be occupied by the owner.\"   She rated the property's functional utility as \"average.\"   Strangis, who was the final purchaser and was present during Dolber's appraisal, testified that the property was \"[b]asically a shell of a house,\" and it was not occupied at the time of her inspection or any time since.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It had a lot of broken windows....  The porch was broken off, a couple of the gutters were gone.  The inside had had no plumbing.  Most of the wiring was gone;  whatever was still there was hanging out of the ceiling....  [I]f there were any tubs and toilets were left in they were turned upside down.  There were no stoves, no cabinets....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was nowhere near liveable....  A lot of the places didn't have doors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her appraisal of 34 Harvard Street, Dolber wrote that \"[a]ll three units are rented at this time.\"   Monteiro testified that none of the units was rented at the time of the appraisal.  Dolber described the property as having \"been maintained in average to good condition,\" with \"all mechanical and electrical services [ ] fully functioning.\"   Martin Pina, the final purchaser of this property, testified that it was \"in very bad condition.  There was no plumbing, no pipes, no copper at all in the building, it had been stripped out.  The building was being used by drug users.  There were syringes on the inside of the building....  [T]here was a lot of structural damage on the inside.\"   Although Dolber certified in her appraisal that she \"personally inspected the subject property, both inside and out,\" Monteiro and DeNunzio testified that Dolber never entered the premises during her appraisal, and Dolber admitted as much to DeNunzio.  Furthermore, Dolber wrote that the property was divided into three units, but Pires testified that there were six units.  Dolber described 11 Lebanon Street as needing \"only minor cosmetic repair\" and that it \"appear[e]d to be in average condition.\"   Monteiro testified that all of the copper pipes were removed from within the house and that both the interior and exterior of the house were in poor condition.  Dolber reported that there were no units vacant, but Monteiro testified that the property was unoccupied at the time of appraisal.  George Strangis testified that there was \"no plumbing in the basement, it had been all ripped out,\" only one of the three hot water heaters stood upright, and it was not connected, \"the other two were laying on their side,\" \"[t]he bathroom ceiling on the first floor ... had been partially ripped down,\" and \"[t]he heating systems weren't operational.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dolber made similar misstatements regarding the condition and occupancy of other properties she appraised.  Although she stated that three units at 18 Winthrop Street were rented at the time, Fred Strangis and Frank Andrews testified that only one of the four units was then rented.  Dolber described 23 Temple Street as having \"been maintained in average to good condition\" with \"all mechanical and electrical services [ ] fully functioning,\" and reported that \"[a]ll three units are rented at this time.\"   Martin Pina, however, testified that at the time of the appraisal the property was boarded up, had no electricity, the plumbing had been \"filled with some type of Ethyl glycol or antifreeze to stop the pipes from bursting,\" there was no water, and nobody lived in the building.  Dolber also repeatedly appraised multiple properties for the same purchaser, and each time reported that the particular property would be owner-occupied.  Thus, in her appraisals she certified that Fred Strangis would occupy four properties, Griffin would occupy two, Andrews would occupy two, and Peter Pina would occupy three.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appraisal form required the appraiser to compare the subject property with recent sale prices of similar properties in the neighborhood, which are known as \"comparable sales.\"   In her appraisals, Dolber relied on data from the publication County Comps, which listed the sale prices for closed sales, as a source of information about comparable sales.  Thus, for example, in her appraisal of 79-81 Keith Street, Dolber used three comparable sales and identified County Comps as her data source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The County Comps she relied on, however, showed that each of the properties she used as comparable sales had been sold twice within a short period for vastly different prices.  Similarly, in her appraisal of 85 Ford Street, Dolber relied on County Comps for her comparable sales.  County Comps showed one of those properties as involving two sales on the same day, with the second price more than double the first price.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dolber's actions in connection with her proposed acquisition of 30-32 Water Street showed her awareness of how the fraudulent scheme was operating and her willingness to participate in it.  She asked DeNunzio to handle a loan for her on the property and proposed that her nephew, Adam Belanger, and his wife, Karen, serve as straw buyers since Dolber had a bad credit rating.  After DeNunzio told Dolber that the Belangers would not qualify for a loan because they did not earn enough money, Dolber told DeNunzio that she would give Karen a job, and asked how much salary Karen needed to earn to qualify for the loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dolber sent DeNunzio a verification of employment form for Karen from Whitinsville Water Company, a company Dolber's father owned, which was \"blank where the employment numbers should have been filled in on the form.\"   Dolber told DeNunzio to fill in the blanks, but when he told her he could not do that, she undertook to do so.  Thereafter, DeNunzio received a completed verification-of-employment form, a W-2 statement, and a pay stub for Karen Belanger.  Both Samuel Carpinetti, Whitinsville Water Company's general manager, and Karen Belanger testified that Karen never worked for the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dolber argues that the government's proof failed because it did not establish the appraised properties' fair market value.  She cites no precedent, however, and we know of none, that requires the government to prove a precise fair market value as an element of the crime of wire fraud.  To the contrary, she notes that \"market value was not in and of itself an element of the offenses with which Ms. Dolber was charged.\"   Furthermore, the evidence justified a jury conclusion that Dolber's appraisals falsely represented the condition and thereby the value of the properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, citing no case law to support her contention, Dolber argues that \"the jury was left to speculate as to what conduct on the part of Ms. Dolber was inappropriate,\" because the government did not point to any code of professional ethics that governed her behavior.  Violation by the defendant of a code of ethics is not an element of the crime of wire fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dolber presented a version of the facts which portrayed her as an innocent victim of DeNunzio's scheme to defraud the lenders.  The foregoing evidence, and other evidence we have not discussed, however, provided the jury with an ample base for rejecting Dolber's claim, and concluding that she committed wire fraud and aided and abetted its commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Conspiracy Convictions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove that a defendant is a member of a conspiracy, the government must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that:  1) the defendant agreed to commit an unlawful act, 2) the defendant voluntarily participated in the scheme, and 3) one of the conspirators took an affirmative step toward achieving the conspiracy's purpose.  Braverman v. United States, 317 U.S. 49, 53, 63 S.Ct. 99, 101, 87 L.Ed. 23 (1942);  United States v. Gomez-Pabon, 911 F.2d 847, 852 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied sub nom.  Guzman v. United States, 498 U.S. 1074, 111 S.Ct. 801, 112 L.Ed.2d 862 (1991).  To prove that a defendant \"belonged to and participated in the conspiracy, the government [must] prove that he intended to agree and that he intended to commit the substantive offense.\"  United States v. Nueva, 979 F.2d 880, 884 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1615, 123 L.Ed.2d 175 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[C]onspiratorial agreement need not be express so long as its existence can plausibly be inferred from the defendants' words and actions and the interdependence of activities and persons involved.\"  United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 241-42 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 849, 111 S.Ct. 139, 112 L.Ed.2d 106 (1990) (citations omitted).  Evidence of participation in the conspiracy may include \"inferences from surrounding circumstances, such as acts committed by the defendant that furthered the conspiracy's purposes.\"  Gomez-Pabon, 911 F.2d at 853.  Furthermore, the government is under no duty to prove that the defendant knew each of the objectives of the conspiracy or all the details.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pezzullo and Dolber do not deny that there was a conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and the record leaves no doubt that one existed.  They argue, however, that the government did not prove that they joined the conspiracy.  Evidence relating to the substantive offenses discussed in Part II.A, also supports the jury verdict of conspiracy.  Moreover, once the evidence establishes the existence of a conspiracy, lesser evidence may suffice to show a defendant's connection with the overall conspiracy.  United States v. Smith, 726 F.2d 852, 866 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As shown above, Pezzullo was aware that the second purchasers did not themselves provide the down payments on the market price, although required to so do by the HUD-1 forms that she and Cassiere had them sign.  She also saw that the same individuals repeatedly attended closings on properties they certified would be owner-occupied.  She was aware of the significant differences in the prices of the two sales in the land flips.  At the first flip Cassiere discussed with Pezzullo prior sales of 59-61 Howard Street.  Pezzullo had done the title work for that closing, and Cassiere was interested in learning what the earlier sale prices were to see if he could justify the higher price to be paid in the double closing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An inference could have been drawn that Dolber followed Monteiro's wishes that her appraisals support the higher sales prices in the second flips.  She repeatedly misstated the condition and occupancy of the properties she appraised, thereby increasing the amounts the lenders would loan on the security of the properties.  Dolber's use of her nephew and his wife as straws in an attempt to purchase 30-32 Water Street for her was further evidence that she was aware of how DeNunzio and Monteiro conducted illegal property sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Don Peters, of First Union Mortgage Corporation, became suspicious about an appraisal that Dolber had conducted on a mortgage First Union purchased from Rate Line.  He asked Dolber to explain the apparent increase in the value of the property within one day which he noted from his review of Banker and Tradesmen, a listing of property values and closing dates.  Dolber called DeNunzio, told him of her conversation with Peters, and asked, \"what's that all about?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a subsequent conversation, DeNunzio told Dolber that he had checked out the situation, that there had been a prior foreclosure sale, but that she would not have known about it because that sale had not been recorded at the time she did the appraisal.  When Dolber told him that Peters had requested a written response, DeNunzio told her that he wanted to review the letter before she sent it out.  The letter Dolber wrote Peters provided an explanation similar to the one DeNunzio had given her:  the low first sale price was due to the fact that the property was purchased from foreclosure, and thus did not reflect the true market value.  At the time she conducted her appraisal, none of her data sources mentioned that sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On another occasion Dolber called DeNunzio and asked him to meet her outside a bar but refused to tell him why she wanted to do so.  He met her there and they had their conversation inside her car.  Dolber told him that she needed photographs of four of the properties she had appraised since Monteiro, and not she, had taken the photographs.  She explained that she needed the pictures in her records, which the United States government had requested.  He agreed to provide her with the pictures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence supports the jury finding that Pezzullo and Dolber were knowing and willing participants in a conspiracy to defraud the lending institutions.  The government is not required to prove that each co-conspirator knew every detail of the scheme;  \"[a]ll that is required is to show 'the essential nature of the plan and their connections with it.' \"  United States v. Rivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d 1073, 1079 (1st Cir.)  (quoting Blumenthal v. United States, 332 U.S. 539, 557, 68 S.Ct. 248, 256, 92 L.Ed. 154 (1947)), cert. denied sub nom.  Castro-Poupart v. United States, 492 U.S. 910, 109 S.Ct. 3227, 106 L.Ed.2d 576 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Questions Asked By the Jurors</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the beginning of the trial, before any of the attorneys had made opening statements, the court told the jury that it could ask the witnesses questions.  The court explained that the questions had to be written;  that the written questions would be submitted to the court, which would review them;  and that the court might not ask a jury question if the question could not be put in a proper legal form or it \"couldn't make any legal difference at all.\"   During the 24-day trial, the court asked the witnesses eleven questions that the jurors had submitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants did not object to the court following the practice thus to ask questions or, indeed, to any particular question asked.  \"In the absence of a timely objection our review is limited to examining the record for plain error, and we will correct only particularly egregious errors ... that seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  United States v. Munson, 819 F.2d 337, 340 (1st Cir.1987) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Sutton, 970 F.2d 1001 (1st Cir.1992), decided after the trial in the present case, we upheld the actions of the same district judge in employing this practice in a mail and wire fraud prosecution, in which the court asked witnesses seven questions submitted by the jurors.  We held that \"especially in complex cases,\" \"allowing juror-inspired questions in a criminal case is not prejudicial per se, but is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.\"  Id. at 1005.   We noted that other circuits similarly had so concluded.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We explained that \"[a]llowing jurors to pose questions during a criminal trial is a procedure fraught with perils.  In most cases, the game will not be worth the candle.  Nevertheless, we are fully committed to the principle that trial judges should be given wide latitude to manage trials.\"  Id.  Although we stated that \"in most situations, the risks inherent in the practice will outweigh its utility,\" we held that we would review the propriety of the practice on a case-by-case basis based on the totality of the circumstances.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Sutton, we held that for four reasons, the court's asking of the juror questions was not reversible error.  First, Sutton \"neither objected nor requested any additional safeguards.\"  Id. at 1006.   Second, \"[b]ecause [Sutton ] was a factually complex case in which a greater-than-average risk of jury confusion existed, the positive value of allowing juror-inspired questioning was relatively high.\"  Id.  Third, the court used appropriate procedural safeguards, such as requiring that the questions be presented in writing to the court and explaining to the jury that the court might not ask all juror questions.  Id.  Fourth, \"the questions themselves were few in number and bland in character.\"  Id. (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first three reasons unquestionably are equally applicable here:  the defendants did not object to the questioning, the case was factually complex, and the court adopted procedural safeguards nearly identical to those in Sutton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sutton involved seven jury questions the court asked during a 2 1/2 day trial.  The present case involves eleven questions asked during a 24-day trial.  The issue, thus, is whether this significantly larger number of questions so seriously undermined the fairness of the trial as to constitute plain error.  We answer that question negatively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The juror questions the court asked were relatively \"bland in character,\" id., and designed to clarify and explain testimony already given.  For example, one juror wanted Paul Pires to identify the word that followed his signature on one of the exhibits.  The word was \"Pres.\"   Another juror wanted Nancy Rullo to explain what the \"preliminary title\" that she referred to in her testimony meant.  One juror sought clarification of who had done the appraisal the witness was discussing.  Although the defendants have objected to allowing juror questions and to the number asked in this case, they have not now argued that any specific question was improper.  Other courts of appeals have upheld convictions where the court asked varying numbers of questions that the jurors proposed.  In United States v. Lewin, 900 F.2d 145 (8th Cir.1990), the court, over objections made in the jury's presence, asked six questions.  The Fourth Circuit upheld a conviction in which the trial court asked ninety-five juror questions during a three-week trial.  DeBenedetto v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 754 F.2d 512 (4th Cir.1985).  The Fifth Circuit approved the asking of one juror question.  United States v. Callahan, 588 F.2d 1078 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 826, 100 S.Ct. 49, 62 L.Ed.2d 33 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In each of these cases the court focused on the effect of the questions on the trial, not the number of questions, in and of itself.  Thus, the Lewin court approved the asking of juror questions because they were factual in nature and merely \"sought clarification of previous testimony and did not introduce new or unrelated subject matter.\"  900 F.2d at 148.   In DeBenedetto, despite the large number of questions, the court \"examined carefully each of the questions propounded by the jurors and [ ] perceive[d] no bias in any of the questions.\"  754 F.2d at 517.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Sutton, we noted that \"juror-inspired questioning becomes particularly troublesome when questions are directed at the [criminal] defendant.\"  970 F.2d at 1006 n. 6.   In Sutton, the court asked only one such question of the defendant.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, the court asked the defendant Cassiere four juror questions during his testimony which spanned three days.  Here, as in Sutton, the \"appellant did not object to [the questions];  and he has not argued on appeal that th[ese questions were] improper or harmful.\"  Id.  We cannot say that the district court committed plain error in asking the defendant Cassiere four relatively benign juror questions during Cassiere's three days of testifying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants argue, however, that by asking the jury questions during the testimony of the witnesses, the court improperly interfered with their ability to conduct direct and cross-examination of the witnesses.  The district court, however, has broad discretion to control trial proceedings.  Id. at 1005 (\"we are fully committed to the principle that trial judges should be given wide latitude to manage trials\");  see also United States v. Slone, 833 F.2d 595, 597 (6th Cir.1987) (The court \"must see that the issues are not obscured and that the testimony is not misunderstood.\").  While objections from opposing counsel and sidebars may be similarly disruptive of counsel's examination, they are interruptions that are also critical to the fair and rational progression of the trial.  We cannot say that the court's asking of the jurors' questions so interfered with counsels' questioning of the witnesses as to constitute a denial of the defendants' right to a fair trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we uphold the district court's asking the juror questions in this case, we reiterate what we said in Sutton regarding the use of this practice.  As we there indicated, the practice should be reserved for exceptional situations, and should not become the routine, even in complex cases.  The district court should inform counsel at the earliest possible time of its intention to use this technique and allow counsel the opportunity to object.  The court should instruct the jurors that they should limit their questions to important points, that at times the rules of evidence will dictate that the court not ask a question, and that the jurors should draw no implication from the court's failure to pose a juror-proposed question to the jury.  The jurors should reduce their questions to writing and pass them to the court.  Before asking a question, the court should offer a sidebar conference to give counsel the opportunity to object.  Finally, in its charge, the court should include a prophylactic instruction, along the lines suggested in Sutton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Evidentiary Rulings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"trial court's rulings on relevance and admissibility will not be disturbed unless there is an abuse of discretion.\"  United States v.

Real estate brokers, insurance agents, and appraisers buy County Comps.   The operating manager of County Comps testified that the reports admitted were authentic.  Dolber referred to County Comps as her source of data for comparable sales in her appraisals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dolber argues that \"although the County Comps listings at first blush appear to deal with compilations of relatively straightforward facts, this evidence required a subjective analysis of other facts.\"   Individuals might differ in the conclusions they draw from the data in County Comps.   But that is not the test for admission of the publication.  The evidence shows that County Comps is a \"published compilation[ ], generally used and relied upon by\" appraisers.  The court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p>B.

These facts were important for the jury in determining whether his participation in the scheme to defraud his clients, the lending institutions, was intentional and knowing.  The district court has discretion to determine the scope of cross-examination, United States v. Tracey, 675 F.2d 433, 437 (1st Cir.1982), and did not abuse its discretion in allowing the preceding colloquy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.

Cassiere testified that he also relied on those deeds, which listed past sale prices, as indications of the value of the property at the time he conducted the title searches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court excluded these deeds \"on the ground of relevance [because] they're [sic] conveyance is too remote in time given, and I take judicial notice at the side bar of the ... marked decline in real estate values within the period of time and material to this lawsuit.\"   The court allowed Cassiere to testify that these deeds formed the basis of his conclusion that the second sale prices in the land flips were justified.  Since the deeds were for sales that occurred four to five years before those at issue in the case, and since the evidence was cumulative to Cassiere's testimony, the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the deeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Admission of Evidence Under Rule 404(b)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pezzullo challenges the court's admission under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) of evidence concerning a real estate transaction not charged in the indictment.  Dolber argues that the court erred in admitting under that rule evidence concerning a similar transaction and a tape recorded conversation between herself and DeNunzio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

Pezzullo signed a purchase and sales agreement with the bank for $65,000.  Cassiere offered to sell the property to Robert Felicio and Richard Rego.  His plan was to pay Felicio and Rego to renovate the property and, thus, provide them with money for their down payment.  Before work was begun on the property, Cassiere had Felicio and Rego inquire of Rate Line whether they could qualify for a mortgage loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cassiere told DeNunzio that he was structuring the sale as a \"no money down flip.\"   After receiving loan information from Felicio and Rego at the law firm, Monteiro told DeNunzio that he was upset that Felicio and Rego \"were sitting in the office along with Joe Cassiere [and] were making jokes about Glenn Monteiro looking the other way in regards to processing a loan the way it should be.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cassiere and Pezzullo decided that they would not make enough profit on the resale so they told Felicio that the deal was off.  Cassiere later negotiated a second purchase agreement with Hybernia for $35,000.  DeNunzio asked Dolber to appraise the property, which she valued at $157,000.  The same month, Pezzullo purchased the property for $35,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dolber also sought to buy property on Water Street using her nephew and his wife as straw buyers due to her own poor credit rating.

The Tape Recording</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following inquiries by the lending institutions, DeNunzio tape-recorded several telephone conversations.  After an evidentiary hearing, the court admitted a tape containing a phone conversation between Dolber and DeNunzio.  The conversation was short, and according to DeNunzio was recorded by accident, because the call from Dolber came in on his call waiting service while he was conducting another conversation that he was taping.  Once DeNunzio finished with each conversation he turned the recorder off and back on again to record his own statement of when and with whom the conversation had taken place.  After recording this information, he clicked Dolber back in through call waiting and recorded his conversation with her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In that conversation, Dolber told DeNunzio that although Karen Belanger did not work at Whitinsville Water Company, they could fill in the appropriate employment verification forms as though she did, and at whatever salary was necessary.

However, one of the \"elements that transform[s] a fiduciary breach into mail fraud ... is where there is a recognizable scheme formed with specific intent to defraud.\"  Id.  This is equally true for wire fraud.  Cassiere admits as much when he writes in his brief:  \"There may be circumstances in which a violation of a non-criminal standard such as the canons of ethics could conceivably be probative on the issue of whether or not there was fraud.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cassiere states both that the record is unclear as to who his client was, and somewhat inconsistently that \"[h]is ostensible client was the bank writing the mortgage for each piece of property.\"   The latter statement is correct.  Cassiere, assisted by his law partner Pezzullo, was the closing attorney and represented the lenders, which he acknowledged at trial.  As attorneys representing the lenders, Cassiere and Pezzullo had a fiduciary duty toward them, which Cassiere also admitted at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v.

You may infer knowledge if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the particular person accused refused to be enlightened, refused to take notice, but only where you find the individual is aware of a high probability that the fact exists and where the individual in his or her own mind does not believe--strike that, does not disbelieve the fact where there's a high probability that the fact that's being misrepresented actually exists and where the person in his or her own mind doesn't disbelieve that fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stated another way, a person's knowledge may be inferred from a willful blindness to the existence of the fact.  It's entirely up to you whether you find any deliberate closing of the eyes, any inference to be drawn from such evidence.  Remember, though, evidence showing negligence or mistake is not enough to support a finding of willful blindness.  The ultimate fact of criminal intent may be established by circumstantial evidence if you are satisfied that it is proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caution is necessary in giving a willful blindness instruction \" 'because of the possibility that the jury will be led to employ a negligence standard and convict a defendant on the impermissible ground that he should have known [an illegal act] was taking place.' \"  United States v.

A court properly gives such an instruction when \"a defendant claims a lack of knowledge, the facts suggest a conscious course of deliberate ignorance, and the instruction, taken as a whole, cannot be misunderstood as mandating an inference of knowledge.\"  Id. at 147.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants did not deny the existence of the scheme to defraud, but contended only that they were unaware of it.  Furthermore, the instruction made it clear to the jurors that it was for them to determine whether the defendants had closed their eyes to what should have been apparent to them.  The court three times used the word \"may\" and explained that \"[i]t's entirely up to you whether you find any deliberate closing of the eyes.\"   See Picciandra, 788 F.2d at 46 (approving an instruction that permitted but did not require the jury to draw an inference of willful blindness).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the government's main contention at trial was that all three defendants were knowing participants in the scheme, the government presented evidence from which the jury could have concluded that if they did not know what was going on, it was only because they chose to turn a blind eye.  \"Guilty knowledge may be inferred where instances of fraud are repeatedly brought to a defendant's attention without prompting alteration of his facilitative conduct.\"  United States v.

[anything] more than negligence is enough.\"   Thus, the argument goes, the jury could have concluded that the breach of canons of ethics alone could constitute \"more than negligence,\" and lead to conviction.  The instruction explained that \"evidence showing negligence or mistake is not enough.\"   It also told the jury that it could consider \"any deliberate closing of the eyes.\"   As with the failure-to-disclose instruction, breach of a fiduciary duty, alone, would not prove willful blindness, but the jury could infer knowledge if it concluded that the defendants \"deliberately\" closed their eyes to facts that they were duty-bound to report to the lending institutions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cassiere further argues that the willful blindness instruction was \"logically inconsistent with the Court's charge on failure to disclose a material fact,\" and that \"[t]he government cannot have it both ways.\"   The willful blindness instruction, however, related to the defendant's knowledge of what occurred.  The failure-to-disclose charge, on the other hand, instructed the jury on determining whether the defendants were involved in the scheme to defraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Dolber argues that the admission of the rule 404(b) evidence to prove her knowledge of the scheme was inconsistent with the government's contention that she remained willfully blind to the scheme.

Olmstead, 832 F.2d 642 (1st Cir.1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1009, 108 S.Ct. 1739, 100 L.Ed.2d 202 (1988), we analyzed in detail the need for instructing the jury on the meaning of reasonable doubt.  We explained that \"[m]ost efforts at clarification result in further obfuscation of the concept,\" id. at 645, and held that \"an instruction which uses the words reasonable doubt without further definition adequately apprises the jury of the proper burden of proof.  This does not mean, of course, that the phrase can be buried as an aside in the [jury charge].\"  Id. at 646.   In essence, we concluded that the district court was in the best position to determine whether, and if so how, to define reasonable doubt.  See also Littlefield, 840 F.2d at 146;  United States v. Rodriguez-Cardona, 924 F.2d 1148, 1160 (1st Cir.)  (\"We have emphasized in the past, and do so again here, that reasonable doubt does not require definition.\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 54, 116 L.Ed.2d 31 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no suggestion that the reference to reasonable doubt was \"buried as an aside\" in the court's charge to the jury.  To the contrary, the court instructed the jury that \"should there be any reasonable doubt of any essential element which the government has to prove as to any of these specific 16 charges, then the person or persons so charged must have the benefit of that reasonable doubt and cannot be convicted on the charge or charges.\"   In its instructions, the court mentioned \"reasonable doubt\" twenty-four more times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to define reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying upon Judge Torruella's concurring opinion in Littlefield in which he stated that \"I am of the opinion that the failure to grant an instruction explaining the term 'proof beyond a reasonable doubt' is an error of constitutional dimension, striking at the very heart of the presumption of innocence,\" 840 F.2d at 151, the defendants urge this court to reconsider the issue en banc.   In view of this court's settled precedent, however, this panel sees no occasion to suggest such reconsideration by the full court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Failure to Give a Maniego Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Maniego, 710 F.2d 24, 28 (2d Cir.1983), the Second Circuit approved the trial court's jury instruction \"that an attorney is not held to a higher standard of conduct, or legal obligation, to verify independently the truth of the information given by a client.\"   In United States v. Picciandra, 788 F.2d 39 (1st Cir.1986), we held that the district court properly refused the defendant's request for a Maniego instruction because \"the government does not try to raise an inference that Lucid should be held to a higher standard than normal, nor did its questions have the effect of raising such an inference.\"  Id. at 46.   Lucid, an attorney, was convicted of aiding and abetting Picciandra in evading income taxes.  He argued that a Maniego instruction was required because the government had suggested that Lucid was culpable in not going beyond what his client had told him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cassiere and Pezzullo did not request a Maniego instruction at trial and claim on appeal that the court committed plain error in not giving such an instruction.  They apparently interpret the Maniego instruction as required whenever the government seeks to \"raise an inference that the defendant should be held to a standard higher than normal because of his status as a lawyer and his position as a former prosecutor.\"   The Maniego instruction, however, is more limited;  it deals with the question whether a lawyer is to be held to a higher standard of conduct \"to verify independently the truth of the information given by a client.\"  Maniego, 710 F.2d at 28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, the charges against Cassiere and Pezzullo were not that they failed to check further on information their clients (the lenders) had given them, but that they defrauded their clients by failing to disclose the land flips that inflated the sales prices of the mortgaged properties.  The district court cannot be faulted, and certainly did not commit plain error, because, in a case involving a significantly different issue from Maniego, it failed to give a Maniego instruction that the defendants had not requested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the record does not show that the government sought to hold Cassiere or Pezzullo to higher standards because of their status as attorneys.  Rather, the government introduced evidence of Cassiere's and Pezzullo's services as attorneys representing the lending institutions and the fiduciary duty they owed to those lenders because those facts were central to understanding their roles in the scheme.  See United States v. Kaplan, 832 F.2d 676, 683 (1st Cir.1987) (Maniego instruction not required where the \"prosecutor did not attempt to create the impression that [the attorney] should be held to a higher standard of care\" and where comments during trial about the defendant's status as an attorney \"were directed towards [defendant's] role (as a lawyer) which was central to the scheme\"), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 907, 108 S.Ct. 1080, 99 L.Ed.2d 239 (1988);  Picciandra, 788 F.2d at 46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, the court instructed the jury that \"it is not a crime simply to be careless or sloppy in discharging your duties as an attorney or an appraiser.  That may be malpractice, but it's not a crime.\"   There was no plain error in the district court's failure to give a Maniego instruction.VI. The district court's refusal to give Dolber a</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p>downward adjustment under the Sentencing Guidelines</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States Sentencing Guideline Section 3B1.2(b) provides that if the defendant \"was a minor participant in any criminal activity,\" the offense level should be decreased by two levels.  Dolber contends that the district court improperly refused to give her such a downward adjustment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We review the trial court's determination of role in the offense only for clear error.\"  United States v. Panet-Collazo, 960 F.2d 256, 261 (1st Cir.), cert. denied sub nom.  Diaz v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 220, 121 L.Ed.2d 158 (1992).  Since a ruling on a downward adjustment is highly fact specific, we give great deference to the trial court's action.  United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 333 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court explained:  \"How do I justify calling her a minor participant when the evidence seems fairly clear that she knew what she was doing and she knew she was acting inappropriately here repetitively?....  She seems key to the successful operation of this fraudulent scheme, just like an attorney is.\"   The lenders relied on her inflated appraisals in making their mortgage loans, and without those appraisals the scheme might not have succeeded.  Although DeNunzio, Monteiro, and Cassiere were more culpable than Dolber, the straw buyers who were Dolber's co-defendants were relatively minor cogs in the scheme to defraud the lenders.  Thus, Dolber was not \"less culpable than most other participants.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.2, comment.  (n. 3).  The court's denial of a downward adjustment was not clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The fraud involved an intricate and sophisticated scheme involving a technique known as a \"land flip,\" under which real property is purchased for a low price, immediately resold at a much higher price to a straw or fictitious buyer, and the higher resale price is used as the basis for obtaining a mortgage loan that finances the entire transaction.  One of the defendants also challenges her sentence.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts convicted the defendants Cassiere and Pezzullo of fifteen counts of wire fraud and aiding and abetting wire fraud, and the defendant Dolber of thirteen counts of that crime (it acquitted her on one count), in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343 (1988), and all three defendants of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371 (1988).  The district court sentenced Cassiere to 46 months imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release, Pezzullo to 24 months imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release, and Dolber to 39 months imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release.  Each defendant also was ordered to make restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The substantive crimes for which the three defendants were convicted involved their participation in a scheme to defraud six mortgage lenders through a series of fifteen land flips, in all but one of which the two sales of the property were closed on the same day, often the second immediately following the first.  Cassiere was the senior partner of Pezzullo in a two-person law firm that handled all the closings in the land flip transactions.  Dolber was a real estate appraiser, whose appraisals of the properties were relied on by the mortgage lenders in making their loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rate Line was a mortgage broker which, for a fee, took loan applications and referred them to lenders.  Thomas DeNunzio owned Rate Line, and he and his employee loan broker, Glenn Monteiro, controlled Rate Line.  DeNunzio and Monteiro planned and organized the fraudulent scheme, under which one of three straw corporations they controlled (Half &amp; Half, Inc., ZBA Corp. and Chantel, Inc.) purchased foreclosed property for cash and resold the property on the same day to straw buyers at a much higher price.  Mortgage loan funds received from the lending institutions were used to pay the corporation controlled by Rate Line and that corporation then paid for the first sale.  The balance then went to DeNunzio and Monteiro, channeled through Rate Line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeNunzio and Monteiro pleaded guilty to another indictment and they both testified for the government in the present case.  They described in detail how the scheme operated, the roles Cassiere, Pezzullo, and Dolber played in the scheme, and DeNunzio's and Monteiro's relationship with the three defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An example of the operation of the scheme was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 12, 1991, Half &amp; Half Corporation closed the purchase of property at 104 Menlo Street for $102,900.  Moments later Half &amp; Half closed the sale of the property to Fred Strangis, one of the dummy purchasers, for $228,000.  Dolber previously had appraised the property at $228,000.  Based on this appraisal and Strangis' certification that he would reside at 104 Menlo Street, Rate Line gave Strangis a mortgage loan of $182,400, which was eighty percent of the final sale price.  Rate Line, in turn, sold Strangis' mortgage to CenTrust Mortgage Corporation.  Neither Half and Half nor Strangis brought a down payment to the double closing.  Instead, Monteiro provided a cashier's check for the twenty percent down payment ($45,600) the lender required the purchaser to make.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cassiere and Pezzullo recorded both deeds and disbursed the funds they had received from the lender.  They paid the original owner the $102,900 owed by Half &amp; Half, they paid the closing costs, including attorneys' fees due them, and gave the balance to Monteiro and DeNunzio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cassiere, assisted by Pezzullo, was the closing attorney in each of the double closings.  They represented the interests of the lending institution that was providing, through Rate Line, the mortgage loan to the final buyer.  The closing attorney serves as \"the eyes and ears\" of the lending institution at the closing.  The lenders expected the attorneys to alert them to anything unusual.  Neither Cassiere nor Pezzullo notified any of the six lenders that their law firm was closing twice on the same property on the same day at substantially different prices.  Dolber was the real estate appraiser in thirteen of the flips.  The lending institutions relied on her appraisals to determine the value of the properties upon which they were making loans.  The appraisal alerts the lenders to the property's condition and allows them to determine their ability to recoup their investment should the borrower default on the mortgage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lenders generally made loans of the lesser of eighty percent of the sale price or fair market value of the property.  The six lenders made mortgage loans totalling more than $2.6 million on the properties that were the subject of the land flips involved in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ten of the thirteen appraisals Dolber made of the properties involved in the land flips were for an amount identical to the final sale price, which ranged from $160,000 to $231,000.  (The original sale prices of those properties ranged from $42,000 to $132,000.)   Two of the three other appraisals were for $1,000 higher than the second sale price;  the third was for $2,000 higher.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pezzullo and Dolber, but not Cassiere, challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support their convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing the record in such a challenge, we \"look[ ] to the evidence as a whole, including reasonable inferences drawn from it, in the light most favorable to the verdict, to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  United States v.

The scheme is shown by DeNunzio's and Monteiro's lengthy testimony about the details of their plan to trick the lending institutions into making risky loans that were warranted by neither the final purchaser's ability to repay the loan nor the particular property's true market value.  Pezzullo and Dolber also do not challenge the use of interstate wire communications to effectuate the plan, as demonstrated at trial by testimonial and physical evidence of the use of fax machines and telephone conversations throughout the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pezzullo and Dolber, however, claim that they were unaware of the scheme and therefore were not knowing and willful participants in it.  We hold, however, that the jury reasonably could have concluded from the voluminous evidence at trial that both Pezzullo and Dolber knowingly participated in the scheme with intent to defraud, and also aided and abetted the fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Pezzullo</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pezzullo participated in all the double closings, almost all of which took place at the office of the Cassiere &amp; Pezzullo law firm.  Fred Strangis testified that Pezzullo's role was to \"prepare all the papers and as you're signing them, would bring them to you, try to get you to read them, try to explain them to you.\"   Frank Andrews and Dennis Griffin, two other straw final buyers, and Marlissa Pina, representing one of the controlled corporate purchasers, corroborated Strangis' testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the lending institutions give higher mortgages to individuals who live in the property they buy, Strangis signed Residential Loan Applications and Owner Occupancy Affidavits, which Pezzullo gave him, stating that he intended to occupy the property.  Strangis was the final purchaser of four properties, however, and at closings on December 12, 1990, February 6, 1991, April 12, 1991, and April 15, 1991, he signed forms stating that four different properties would be his primary residence.  Other straw final purchasers similarly signed multiple owner-occupancy documents at the closings:  Peter Pina within one month and a half signed three such forms;  Jeanette Monteiro within a four-month period twice signed such documents;  Dennis Griffin in one month signed two such documents;  and Frank Andrews within three months signed two.  Pezzullo witnessed the signing of each of these documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the lenders required that the purchaser bring a twenty percent down payment to the closing.  Neither the straw buyers making the second purchases nor the corporations making the first purchases brought down payments with them.  Instead, Cassiere or Pezzullo notified Monteiro before the closing of the amount of the down payment and he would bring a cashier's check for that amount to the closing.  Nonetheless, the HUD-1 Settlement Statements that Cassiere filled out at the closings reported that the buyers had brought the money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only function of the officers of the corporations that DeNunzio and Monteiro controlled was to sign legal documents designed to keep Monteiro's and DeNunzio's roles hidden.  Pezzullo, however, was aware that DeNunzio and Monteiro controlled the corporations, since Half &amp; Half used the Cassiere and Pezzullo offices as its corporate address.  At the double closings where each property was first sold and then purchased, neither Cassiere nor Pezzullo told the corporate officers what the documents they were signing meant, or that they were buying and selling real property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pezzullo handled the distribution of the proceeds from the second half of the flip.  The proceeds were \"the difference between the loan amount [from the lender] minus the first sale price, minus any closing costs.\"   After Cassiere and Pezzullo had completed the deeds on the two sales following the double closings, Pezzullo disbursed the funds that came from the final purchaser's mortgage.  Pezzullo gave Monteiro the amount due to the original owner from the first half of the flip, returned the down payments to Monteiro and DeNunzio, and distributed the remaining proceeds to Monteiro and DeNunzio for them to divide.  In addition to distributing the mortgage funds, Pezzullo prepared disbursement sheets noting the funds received and the funds disbursed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paul Pires, as Half &amp; Half's president, first bought and then sold property in nine of the flips.  At each closing, in Pezzullo's presence, he signed a HUD-1 form and a statement certifying that he had received a copy of the HUD-1 form, yet neither Cassiere nor Pezzullo ever gave him that document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">George Gundensen, president of CenTrust Corporation, one of the lending institutions, testified that the closing attorney is expected to fill in all blank spaces in loan documents before having the mortgagor sign the documents.  Some of the final buyers signed forms at the closing, however, that were completely blank.  In fact, Cassiere and Pezzullo discussed in Marlissa Pina's presence that they were asking her to sign a blank document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the lending institutions been informed that the same law firm had closed twice on the same property on the same day and with such wide price disparities, they would have either \"suspend[ed] the loan for further information or cancell[ed] the loan.\"   Because of the large difference between the two sale prices, the lending institution would have believed that it \"would be making a loan on a piece of property, the value for which wouldn't support the amount of the loan being made.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foregoing evidence, together with additional evidence in the record we have not discussed, justified the jury's conclusion that Pezzullo both committed wire fraud and aided and abetted its commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Dolber</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Dolber never participated in the closings, she had a vital role in making the scheme work.  Her appraisal forms, which she submitted to Rate Line, supported the high second sale price and thus resulted in the higher mortgages.  The lenders relied heavily on the accuracy of Dolber's appraisals.  As noted, every appraisal she submitted on the thirteen land flips for properties was identical to the second sale prices, or, in three instances, slightly higher.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeNunzio testified that he wanted to use Dolber as the appraiser because he knew from talking to her that \"she would bring in property values as high as possible,\" and that she \"would use non-arm's length transactions for sales comparisons.\"   By non-arm's length transactions, DeNunzio meant \"that the comparable sales used were not a true sale with a wanting borrower and a wanting seller.\"   Instead, the comparable sales she used often were previous flips that Rate Line had established, and, therefore, did not reflect true market value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Monteiro accompanied Dolber in viewing some of the appraised properties.  He told her of the proposed sale price for the second half of the flip.  Usually, the appraised value was very close to the intended sale price.  Dolber \"appraised at the value needed, so we [Rate Line] continued to use her.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was ample evidence upon which the jury could conclude that Dolber frequently misstated the conditions of the appraised properties, making them appear more valuable than they were.  Thus, in her appraisal of 69 Turner Street, Dolber wrote that the property was in need of \"cosmetic and minor roof repair,\" the bathrooms were \"fully functioning,\" the \"[k]itchen cabinets are adequate,\" \"two units are rented at this time,\" and the third unit \"will be occupied by the owner.\"   She rated the property's functional utility as \"average.\"   Strangis, who was the final purchaser and was present during Dolber's appraisal, testified that the property was \"[b]asically a shell of a house,\" and it was not occupied at the time of her inspection or any time since.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It had a lot of broken windows....  The porch was broken off, a couple of the gutters were gone.  The inside had had no plumbing.  Most of the wiring was gone;  whatever was still there was hanging out of the ceiling....  [I]f there were any tubs and toilets were left in they were turned upside down.  There were no stoves, no cabinets....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was nowhere near liveable....  A lot of the places didn't have doors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her appraisal of 34 Harvard Street, Dolber wrote that \"[a]ll three units are rented at this time.\"   Monteiro testified that none of the units was rented at the time of the appraisal.  Dolber described the property as having \"been maintained in average to good condition,\" with \"all mechanical and electrical services [ ] fully functioning.\"   Martin Pina, the final purchaser of this property, testified that it was \"in very bad condition.  There was no plumbing, no pipes, no copper at all in the building, it had been stripped out.  The building was being used by drug users.  There were syringes on the inside of the building....  [T]here was a lot of structural damage on the inside.\"   Although Dolber certified in her appraisal that she \"personally inspected the subject property, both inside and out,\" Monteiro and DeNunzio testified that Dolber never entered the premises during her appraisal, and Dolber admitted as much to DeNunzio.  Furthermore, Dolber wrote that the property was divided into three units, but Pires testified that there were six units.  Dolber described 11 Lebanon Street as needing \"only minor cosmetic repair\" and that it \"appear[e]d to be in average condition.\"   Monteiro testified that all of the copper pipes were removed from within the house and that both the interior and exterior of the house were in poor condition.  Dolber reported that there were no units vacant, but Monteiro testified that the property was unoccupied at the time of appraisal.  George Strangis testified that there was \"no plumbing in the basement, it had been all ripped out,\" only one of the three hot water heaters stood upright, and it was not connected, \"the other two were laying on their side,\" \"[t]he bathroom ceiling on the first floor ... had been partially ripped down,\" and \"[t]he heating systems weren't operational.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dolber made similar misstatements regarding the condition and occupancy of other properties she appraised.  Although she stated that three units at 18 Winthrop Street were rented at the time, Fred Strangis and Frank Andrews testified that only one of the four units was then rented.  Dolber described 23 Temple Street as having \"been maintained in average to good condition\" with \"all mechanical and electrical services [ ] fully functioning,\" and reported that \"[a]ll three units are rented at this time.\"   Martin Pina, however, testified that at the time of the appraisal the property was boarded up, had no electricity, the plumbing had been \"filled with some type of Ethyl glycol or antifreeze to stop the pipes from bursting,\" there was no water, and nobody lived in the building.  Dolber also repeatedly appraised multiple properties for the same purchaser, and each time reported that the particular property would be owner-occupied.  Thus, in her appraisals she certified that Fred Strangis would occupy four properties, Griffin would occupy two, Andrews would occupy two, and Peter Pina would occupy three.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appraisal form required the appraiser to compare the subject property with recent sale prices of similar properties in the neighborhood, which are known as \"comparable sales.\"   In her appraisals, Dolber relied on data from the publication County Comps, which listed the sale prices for closed sales, as a source of information about comparable sales.  Thus, for example, in her appraisal of 79-81 Keith Street, Dolber used three comparable sales and identified County Comps as her data source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The County Comps she relied on, however, showed that each of the properties she used as comparable sales had been sold twice within a short period for vastly different prices.  Similarly, in her appraisal of 85 Ford Street, Dolber relied on County Comps for her comparable sales.  County Comps showed one of those properties as involving two sales on the same day, with the second price more than double the first price.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dolber's actions in connection with her proposed acquisition of 30-32 Water Street showed her awareness of how the fraudulent scheme was operating and her willingness to participate in it.  She asked DeNunzio to handle a loan for her on the property and proposed that her nephew, Adam Belanger, and his wife, Karen, serve as straw buyers since Dolber had a bad credit rating.  After DeNunzio told Dolber that the Belangers would not qualify for a loan because they did not earn enough money, Dolber told DeNunzio that she would give Karen a job, and asked how much salary Karen needed to earn to qualify for the loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dolber sent DeNunzio a verification of employment form for Karen from Whitinsville Water Company, a company Dolber's father owned, which was \"blank where the employment numbers should have been filled in on the form.\"   Dolber told DeNunzio to fill in the blanks, but when he told her he could not do that, she undertook to do so.  Thereafter, DeNunzio received a completed verification-of-employment form, a W-2 statement, and a pay stub for Karen Belanger.  Both Samuel Carpinetti, Whitinsville Water Company's general manager, and Karen Belanger testified that Karen never worked for the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dolber argues that the government's proof failed because it did not establish the appraised properties' fair market value.  She cites no precedent, however, and we know of none, that requires the government to prove a precise fair market value as an element of the crime of wire fraud.  To the contrary, she notes that \"market value was not in and of itself an element of the offenses with which Ms. Dolber was charged.\"   Furthermore, the evidence justified a jury conclusion that Dolber's appraisals falsely represented the condition and thereby the value of the properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, citing no case law to support her contention, Dolber argues that \"the jury was left to speculate as to what conduct on the part of Ms. Dolber was inappropriate,\" because the government did not point to any code of professional ethics that governed her behavior.  Violation by the defendant of a code of ethics is not an element of the crime of wire fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dolber presented a version of the facts which portrayed her as an innocent victim of DeNunzio's scheme to defraud the lenders.  The foregoing evidence, and other evidence we have not discussed, however, provided the jury with an ample base for rejecting Dolber's claim, and concluding that she committed wire fraud and aided and abetted its commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Conspiracy Convictions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove that a defendant is a member of a conspiracy, the government must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that:  1) the defendant agreed to commit an unlawful act, 2) the defendant voluntarily participated in the scheme, and 3) one of the conspirators took an affirmative step toward achieving the conspiracy's purpose.

They argue, however, that the government did not prove that they joined the conspiracy.  Evidence relating to the substantive offenses discussed in Part II.A, also supports the jury verdict of conspiracy.  Moreover, once the evidence establishes the existence of a conspiracy, lesser evidence may suffice to show a defendant's connection with the overall conspiracy.  United States v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"430880\"><a href=\"/opinion/430880/united-states-v-claudius-smith-united-states-of-america-v-franklin-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">726</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">852</span></a></span>, 866 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As shown above, Pezzullo was aware that the second purchasers did not themselves provide the down payments on the market price, although required to so do by the HUD-1 forms that she and Cassiere had them sign.  She also saw that the same individuals repeatedly attended closings on properties they certified would be owner-occupied.  She was aware of the significant differences in the prices of the two sales in the land flips.  At the first flip Cassiere discussed with Pezzullo prior sales of 59-61 Howard Street.  Pezzullo had done the title work for that closing, and Cassiere was interested in learning what the earlier sale prices were to see if he could justify the higher price to be paid in the double closing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An inference could have been drawn that Dolber followed Monteiro's wishes that her appraisals support the higher sales prices in the second flips.  She repeatedly misstated the condition and occupancy of the properties she appraised, thereby increasing the amounts the lenders would loan on the security of the properties.  Dolber's use of her nephew and his wife as straws in an attempt to purchase 30-32 Water Street for her was further evidence that she was aware of how DeNunzio and Monteiro conducted illegal property sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Don Peters, of First Union Mortgage Corporation, became suspicious about an appraisal that Dolber had conducted on a mortgage First Union purchased from Rate Line.  He asked Dolber to explain the apparent increase in the value of the property within one day which he noted from his review of Banker and Tradesmen, a listing of property values and closing dates.  Dolber called DeNunzio, told him of her conversation with Peters, and asked, \"what's that all about?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a subsequent conversation, DeNunzio told Dolber that he had checked out the situation, that there had been a prior foreclosure sale, but that she would not have known about it because that sale had not been recorded at the time she did the appraisal.  When Dolber told him that Peters had requested a written response, DeNunzio told her that he wanted to review the letter before she sent it out.  The letter Dolber wrote Peters provided an explanation similar to the one DeNunzio had given her:  the low first sale price was due to the fact that the property was purchased from foreclosure, and thus did not reflect the true market value.  At the time she conducted her appraisal, none of her data sources mentioned that sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On another occasion Dolber called DeNunzio and asked him to meet her outside a bar but refused to tell him why she wanted to do so.  He met her there and they had their conversation inside her car.  Dolber told him that she needed photographs of four of the properties she had appraised since Monteiro, and not she, had taken the photographs.  She explained that she needed the pictures in her records, which the United States government had requested.  He agreed to provide her with the pictures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence supports the jury finding that Pezzullo and Dolber were knowing and willing participants in a conspiracy to defraud the lending institutions.

The present case involves eleven questions asked during a 24-day trial.  The issue, thus, is whether this significantly larger number of questions so seriously undermined the fairness of the trial as to constitute plain error.  We answer that question negatively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The juror questions the court asked were relatively \"bland in character,\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587576\"><a href=\"/opinion/587576/united-states-v-arthur-sutton/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> and designed </a></span>to clarify and explain testimony already given.  For example, one juror wanted Paul Pires to identify the word that followed his signature on one of the exhibits.  The word was \"Pres.\"   Another juror wanted Nancy Rullo to explain what the \"preliminary title\" that she referred to in her testimony meant.  One juror sought clarification of who had done the appraisal the witness was discussing.  Although the defendants have objected to allowing juror questions and to the number asked in this case, they have not now argued that any specific question was improper.  Other courts of appeals have upheld convictions where the court asked varying numbers of questions that the jurors proposed.  In United States v. Lewin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539254\"><a href=\"/opinion/539254/united-states-v-delroy-lewin-aka-tony-united-states-of-america-v-oral/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span> </a></span>(8th Cir.1990), the court, over objections made in the jury's presence, asked six questions.

Thus, the Lewin court approved the asking of juror questions because they were factual in nature and merely \"sought clarification of previous testimony and did not introduce new or unrelated subject <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539254\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">matter.\"</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/539254/united-states-v-delroy-lewin-aka-tony-united-states-of-america-v-oral/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>.

Here, as in Sutton, the \"appellant did not object to [the questions];  and he has not argued on appeal that th[ese questions were] improper or harmful.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587576\"><a href=\"/opinion/587576/united-states-v-arthur-sutton/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  We cannot </a></span>say that the district court committed plain error in asking the defendant Cassiere four relatively benign juror questions during Cassiere's three days of testifying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants argue, however, that by asking the jury questions during the testimony of the witnesses, the court improperly interfered with their ability to conduct direct and cross-examination of the witnesses.  The district court, however, has broad discretion to control trial proceedings.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587576\"><a href=\"/opinion/587576/united-states-v-arthur-sutton/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1005 </a></span>(\"we are fully committed to the principle that trial judges should be given wide latitude to manage trials\");  see also United States v.

While objections from opposing counsel and sidebars may be similarly disruptive of counsel's examination, they are interruptions that are also critical to the fair and rational progression of the trial.  We cannot say that the court's asking of the jurors' questions so interfered with counsels' questioning of the witnesses as to constitute a denial of the defendants' right to a fair trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we uphold the district court's asking the juror questions in this case, we reiterate what we said in Sutton regarding the use of this practice.  As we there indicated, the practice should be reserved for exceptional situations, and should not become the routine, even in complex cases.  The district court should inform counsel at the earliest possible time of its intention to use this technique and allow counsel the opportunity to object.  The court should instruct the jurors that they should limit their questions to important points, that at times the rules of evidence will dictate that the court not ask a question, and that the jurors should draw no implication from the court's failure to pose a juror-proposed question to the jury.  The jurors should reduce their questions to writing and pass them to the court.  Before asking a question, the court should offer a sidebar conference to give counsel the opportunity to object.  Finally, in its charge, the court should include a prophylactic instruction, along the lines suggested in Sutton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

Pezzullo signed a purchase and sales agreement with the bank for $65,000.  Cassiere offered to sell the property to Robert Felicio and Richard Rego.  His plan was to pay Felicio and Rego to renovate the property and, thus, provide them with money for their down payment.  Before work was begun on the property, Cassiere had Felicio and Rego inquire of Rate Line whether they could qualify for a mortgage loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cassiere told DeNunzio that he was structuring the sale as a \"no money down flip.\"   After receiving loan information from Felicio and Rego at the law firm, Monteiro told DeNunzio that he was upset that Felicio and Rego \"were sitting in the office along with Joe Cassiere [and] were making jokes about Glenn Monteiro looking the other way in regards to processing a loan the way it should be.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cassiere and Pezzullo decided that they would not make enough profit on the resale so they told Felicio that the deal was off.  Cassiere later negotiated a second purchase agreement with Hybernia for $35,000.  DeNunzio asked Dolber to appraise the property, which she valued at $157,000.

After an evidentiary hearing, the court admitted a tape containing a phone conversation between Dolber and DeNunzio.  The conversation was short, and according to DeNunzio was recorded by accident, because the call from Dolber came in on his call waiting service while he was conducting another conversation that he was taping.  Once DeNunzio finished with each conversation he turned the recorder off and back on again to record his own statement of when and with whom the conversation had taken place.

[anything] more than negligence is enough.\"   Thus, the argument goes, the jury could have concluded that the breach of canons of ethics alone could constitute \"more than negligence,\" and lead to conviction.  The instruction explained that \"evidence showing negligence or mistake is not enough.\"   It also told the jury that it could consider \"any deliberate closing of the eyes.\"   As with the failure-to-disclose instruction, breach of a fiduciary duty, alone, would not prove willful blindness, but the jury could infer knowledge if it concluded that the defendants \"deliberately\" closed their eyes to facts that they were duty-bound to report to the lending institutions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cassiere further argues that the willful blindness instruction was \"logically inconsistent with the Court's charge on failure to disclose a material fact,\" and that \"[t]he government cannot have it both ways.\"   The willful blindness instruction, however, related to the defendant's knowledge of what occurred.  The failure-to-disclose charge, on the other hand, instructed the jury on determining whether the defendants were involved in the scheme to defraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Dolber argues that the admission of the rule 404(b) evidence to prove her knowledge of the scheme was inconsistent with the government's contention that she remained willfully blind to the scheme.  We know of no authority, however, that prohibits the government from proceeding on alternate theories in a criminal case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Refusal to Define Reasonable Doubt</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cassiere, Pezzullo, and Dolber challenge the court's denial of Dolber's request for an instruction defining reasonable doubt.

To the contrary, the court instructed the jury that \"should there be any reasonable doubt of any essential element which the government has to prove as to any of these specific 16 charges, then the person or persons so charged must have the benefit of that reasonable doubt and cannot be convicted on the charge or charges.\"   In its instructions, the court mentioned \"reasonable doubt\" twenty-four more times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to define reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying upon Judge Torruella's concurring opinion in Littlefield in which he stated that \"I am of the opinion that the failure to grant an instruction explaining the term 'proof beyond a reasonable doubt' is an error of constitutional dimension, striking at the very heart of the presumption of <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502257\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">innocence,\"</span> <a href=\"/opinion/502257/united-states-v-thomas-littlefield/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span>, the defendants urge this court to reconsider the issue en banc.

Failure to Give a Maniego Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v.

Picciandra, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"468531\"><a href=\"/opinion/468531/united-states-v-michael-a-picciandra-united-states-of-america-v-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">788</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1986), we held that the district court properly refused the defendant's request for a Maniego instruction because \"the government does not try to raise an inference that Lucid should be held to a higher standard than normal, nor did its questions have the effect of raising such an inference.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"468531\"><a href=\"/opinion/468531/united-states-v-michael-a-picciandra-united-states-of-america-v-a/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 46. </a></span>  Lucid, an attorney, was convicted of aiding and abetting Picciandra in evading income taxes.  He argued that a Maniego instruction was required because the government had suggested that Lucid was culpable in not going beyond what his client had told him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cassiere and Pezzullo did not request a Maniego instruction at trial and claim on appeal that the court committed plain error in not giving such an instruction.  They apparently interpret the Maniego instruction as required whenever the government seeks to \"raise an inference that the defendant should be held to a standard higher than normal because of his status as a lawyer and his position as a former prosecutor.\"   The Maniego instruction, however, is more limited;  it deals with the question whether a lawyer is to be held to a higher standard of conduct \"to verify independently the truth of the information given by a client.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"420694\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Maniego,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/420694/united-states-v-angelito-maniego-hector-galang-teodoro-monte/\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, the charges against Cassiere and Pezzullo were not that they failed to check further on information their clients (the lenders) had given them, but that they defrauded their clients by failing to disclose the land flips that inflated the sales prices of the mortgaged properties.  The district court cannot be faulted, and certainly did not commit plain error, because, in a case involving a significantly different issue from Maniego, it failed to give a Maniego instruction that the defendants had not requested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the record does not show that the government sought to hold Cassiere or Pezzullo to higher standards because of their status as attorneys.  Rather, the government introduced evidence of Cassiere's and Pezzullo's services as attorneys representing the lending institutions and the fiduciary duty they owed to those lenders because those facts were central to understanding their roles in the scheme.

She seems key to the successful operation of this fraudulent scheme, just like an attorney is.\"   The lenders relied on her inflated appraisals in making their mortgage loans, and without those appraisals the scheme might not have succeeded.  Although DeNunzio, Monteiro, and Cassiere were more culpable than Dolber, the straw buyers who were Dolber's co-defendants were relatively minor cogs in the scheme to defraud the lenders.  Thus, Dolber was not \"less culpable than most other participants.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.2, comment.  (n. 3).
