The  National  Labor   Relations  Board\r                            \n\npetitions  for  an  adjudication of  civil  contempt  against\n\nHospital  San Francisco, Inc. (\"the hospital\").  In 1989, the\n\nBoard  ruled that the hospital had violated   8(a)(5) and (1)\n\nof the National Labor Relations Act by refusing to  recognize\n\nand bargain  with a union  representing a unit  of registered\n\nnurses.  In  a judgment  dated February 5,  1991, this  court\n\nenforced  the Board's order.   As part of  that judgment, the\n\nhospital was required to: \n\n     1.  Cease and desist from:\n\n          (a) Refusing to recognize and bargain with the\n     Union   as   the  exclusive   collective-bargaining\n     representative of its employees in  the appropriate\n     unit.\n          ....\n\n          (c) In  any like or related manner interfering\n     with,  restraining, or  coercing  employees in  the\n     exercise of  the rights guaranteed by  Section 7 of\n     the Act.\n\n     2.  Take the following affirmative action necessary\n     to effectuate the policies of the Act:\n\n          (a)   Upon   request,   bargain   collectively\n     concerning   rates  of   pay,   wages,   hours   of\n     employment,  and  other  terms  and  conditions  of\n     employment with the Union ... and, if an  agreement\n     is reached, embody it in a signed contract.\n\nThe Board contends that the hospital violated the judgment in\n\nOctober  1991 by  unilaterally  implementing a  work-schedule\n\nchange after  speaking directly to the  employees and without\n\nconsulting  the  union.   We  agree  and therefore  find  the\n\nhospital in contempt.\n\n                              I.\r\n\n     The  facts  are undisputed  and straightforward.1   They\n\nderive  entirely from the  hospital's pleadings and exhibits,\n\nparticularly  from  an  affidavit  submitted  by  a  hospital\n\nadministrator  who  was involved  in  union  bargaining.   In\n\nOctober 1991, in order to compensate for a shortage of nurses\n\nand to reduce absenteeism,  the hospital decided to implement\n\nan  extended-work-schedule  program  on  a  voluntary,  trial\n\nbasis.   Under  this  plan, participating  nurses would  work\n\ntwelve-hour shifts  seven times every two  weeks, rather than\n\nthe customary eight-hour  shifts five times  per week.   Some\n\nchanges in  wages and  differentials would also  be involved.\n\nAt the monthly meetings  held in various hospital departments\n\nthat same  month, hospital supervisors presented  the plan to\n\nthe nurses.  No negotiation  occurred over its terms; rather,\n\nthe terms were described and the nurses were given the option\n\nof participating  or not.   An  undisclosed number of  nurses\n\nagreed  to  participate,  each  of  whom  signed  a  document\n\nacknowledging that such participation was voluntary.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Although  the Board  has moved,  in the  alternative, for\nreference to a special  master, it insists that there  are no\nmaterial factual issues  in dispute.   The hospital does  not\ndisagree; in  fact, the hospital  (like the Board)  has moved\nfor summary adjudication.  We  agree that disposition of this\nmatter can be  reached on  the basis of  the present  record.\nSee, e.g.,  NLRB v. Holyoke Water Power  Co., 793 F.2d 18, 18\r                                                        \n(1st Cir.  1986) (adjudging respondent in  contempt \"[o]n the\nbasis of the papers\" presented). \n\n                             -3-\r\n\n     On November 20,  1991, the  date of  the next  regularly\n\nscheduled  bargaining  session,2  the  hospital  informed the\n\nunion that  the extended-schedule plan  had been implemented.\n\nThe union expressed interest, and the two sides held at least\n\nfive additional meetings over the  next four months at which,\n\namong  other matters,  the  details of  such  a program  were\n\nnegotiated.  The record before us describes such negotiations\n\nup  through March 25, 1992, at which point agreement had been\n\nreached with  respect to  all but  one  issue regarding  this\n\nprogram.\n\n                             II.\n\n     Where the Board seeks an adjudication of civil contempt,\n\nit  must  present  clear  and convincing  evidence  that  the\n\ncompany  has engaged  in contumacious  behavior.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \n\nNLRB v. Trailways, Inc., 729 F.2d 1013, 1017 (5th Cir. 1984);\r                                   \n\nNLRB v.

As this\n\nis a proceeding in civil, rather than criminal, contempt, the\n\nBoard  need not  establish willfulness  or  bad faith.   See,\r                                                                        \n\ne.g., McComb  v.

Specifically,  the\n\nhospital  is said to  have violated   8(a)(5)  and (1) of the\n\nAct by  dealing directly  with employees and  by unilaterally\n\nchanging  working conditions.   We  agree.   Implicit  in the\n\nobligation to  bargain in good  faith \"is the  principle that\n\nthe  employer  is  not to  go  behind  the  union's back  and\n\nnegotiate with individual workers, nor otherwise to undermine\n\nthe union's  status as exclusive  bargaining representative.\"\n\nSzabo  v.  U.S. Marine  Corp., 819  F.2d  714, 718  (7th Cir.\r                                         \n\n1987);  accord, e.g., Medo  Photo Supply  Corp. v.

U.S. Sonics  Corp., 312 F.2d  610, 615  (1st\r                                               \n\nCir. 1963); R. Gorman, Labor Law c. 19,   2 (1976).  We think\r                                            \n\nthat, by meeting with the nurses in October and inviting them\n\nto participate in the extended-schedule program, the hospital\n\ncontravened this principle.  \n\n     The hospital  stresses that it engaged  in no individual\n\nnegotiations with the nurses but simply offered the plan on a\n\n                             -5-\r\n\ntake-it-or-leave-it  basis.   This  is  true  but beside  the\n\npoint.    Proposing  a  new  program  directly  to  employees\n\nconstitutes  a   form  of  negotiation   encompassed  by  the\n\nprohibition  on  direct dealing,  regardless  of whether  the\n\nindividual terms  of that  plan are  negotiable.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \n\nHajoca  Corp. v.  NLRB, 872  F.2d 1169,  1176 (3d  Cir. 1989)\r                                  \n\n(direct dealing \"also consists  of presenting an entirely new\n\nproposal  that  potentially undermines  the authority  of the\n\nduly elected bargaining representatives\").  The hospital also\n\nargues that its  overtures to  the nurses  were justified  in\n\nthat it was  necessary to  gauge their interest  in the  plan\n\nbefore  raising the  issue with  the union.   Soliciting  the\n\nviews  of employees  concerning possible  changes in  working\n\nconditions  can itself violate   8(a)(5) and (1).  See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \n\nNLRB  v.

This of course\n\nfalls  well short  of a valid  excuse, especially  absent any\n\nshowing (1)  that the extended-schedule program  needed to be\n\nimplemented on an emergency basis or (2) that the union could\n\nnot have been contacted through other channels.  \n\n     Second, the  hospital argues  that its actions  were not\n\nviolative of the Act  because the program was initiated  only\n\non  a  voluntary and  experimental basis.    Yet it  cites no\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  In Soule Glass, we identified five circumstances in which\r                              \nunilateral  action will not violate    8(a)(5): (1) where the\naction  involves a matter which is not a mandatory subject of\nbargaining; (2) where a negotiating impasse has been reached;\n(3)  where the  changes merely  preserve the  \"dynamic status\nquo\"; (4) where the  union has waived its right to bargain on\nthe  issue; and  (5)  where the  action involves  fundamental\nchanges   which   are  \"peculiarly   matters   of  management\nprerogative.\"  652 F.2d at 1084-85; accord, e.g.,  R. Gorman,\r                                                            \nsupra, at  c. 20,    11-15.  The instant case falls into none\r                 \nof these exceptions.  \n\n                             -7-\r\n\nauthority for--and we find unpersuasive--the  view that these\n\ncharacteristics nullified the duty to bargain.  The fact that\n\nparticipation therein  was voluntary does not  alter the fact\n\nthat  the extended-schedule program entailed changes in hours\n\nand  wages--matters   that  were   a  mandatory  subject   of\n\nbargaining.   Cf.  Standard  Fittings Co.  v. NLRB,  845 F.2d\r                                                              \n\n1311, 1313-14 (5th Cir.  1988) (offering employees the choice\n\nof (1) lower wages and  a full work week or (2)  higher wages\n\nand reduced hours violated  Act).  And as the  Board properly\n\nnotes,  employers could  readily  circumvent  the  bargaining\n\nrequirement   by  characterizing   any  proposed   change  as\n\n\"experimental.\"  The hospital  explains that it was necessary\n\nto implement the program on  a trial basis in order  to gauge\n\nemployee  interest.    Yet  as noted  above,  this  rationale\n\nprovides no justification for initiating  the program without\n\nconsulting the union.\n\n     Finally,   the   hospital   argues   that,   because  it\n\nsubsequently  engaged in extended negotiations with the union\n\nconcerning  the  program,  any   earlier  disregard  of   its\n\nbargaining  duties  was  merely a  technical  violation  that\n\nshould  not warrant  a contempt  adjudication.4   It is  true\n\nthat the unlawful conduct here was both short-lived and  less\n\nthan  flagrant  in nature.

Yet  this is  the  third\n\noccasion  in recent  years  on which  the  hospital has  been\n\ndeemed guilty  of unfair  labor practices against  the union.\n\nThe  hospital  suggests  that  such  earlier  violations were\n\nisolated events undertaken in  good faith.  To the  contrary,\n\nthis  court  noted in  an April  1991  order that  the record\n\ncontained evidence  of \"continued recalcitrance.\"   Even more\n\nto the point,  an administrative law judge  found in December\n\n1991 that the hospital had engaged in \"pretexts\" and  \"shams\"\n\nin  order  to  avoid  bargaining,  and  that  it  had  \"never\n\n                             -9-\r\n\nsincerely attempted  to reach an agreement  with the Union.\"5\n\nAs  was noted in  NLRB v. J.P.  Stevens &amp; Co.,  538 F.2d 1152\r                                                         \n\n(5th Cir. 1976):\n\n     [A]pparently  insignificant unilateral  action that\n     may constitute de  minimis activity when undertaken\r                                           \n     by  a company with a clean slate in labor law, must\n     be  viewed more  warily when  committed by  one who\n     enjoys  a record  for  intransigence ....   When  a\n     company  has  historically  evidenced  disdain  for\n     employees'  rights  and the  Congressional mandate,\n     its prior history is relevant  to the question of a\n     de minimis failure to bargain.\r                           \n\nId.  at  1163.    In  light  of  the  hospital's  history  of\r               \n\nintransigence  toward  the union,  we  think  its actions  in\n\nOctober   1991   constitute   sufficient   grounds   for   an\n\nadjudication in contempt.   At the same time, given  that the\n\nviolations here  were not  flagrant  in nature,  we think  it\n\nunnecessary to  impose prospective fines as  requested by the\n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.  In particular, the ALJ found as follows:\n\n     [T]he   credible  record   in  this   case  clearly\n     establishes that the  [hospital] has continued  its\n     recalcitrance and is continuing  its evasion of its\n     statutory obligations by  utilizing the  withdrawal\n     of recognition and the filing of its RM petition as\n     a new  pretext  for  a  refusal to  bargain.    The\n     [hospital]  has never sincerely  attempted to reach\n     an agreement with the Union.\n          ....\n          The [hospital's] withdrawal of recognition and\n     the  filing of  the RM  petition were  pretexts and\n     shams, the real purpose  for which was the delaying\n     of collective bargaining and ultimately the ousting\n     of the Union from the [hospital's] premises.\n\nThis  decision was  not challenged  by  the hospital  and was\nlater upheld by the Board.\n\n                             -10-\r\n\nBoard.

The  National  Labor   Relations  Board\r                            \n\npetitions  for  an  adjudication of  civil  contempt  against\n\nHospital  San Francisco, Inc. (\"the hospital\").  In 1989, the\n\nBoard  ruled that the hospital had violated   8(a)(5) and (1)\n\nof the National Labor Relations Act by refusing to  recognize\n\nand bargain  with a union  representing a unit  of registered\n\nnurses.  In  a judgment  dated February 5,  1991, this  court\n\nenforced  the Board's order.   As part of  that judgment, the\n\nhospital was required to: \n\n     1.  Cease and desist from:\n\n          (a) Refusing to recognize and bargain with the\n     Union   as   the  exclusive   collective-bargaining\n     representative of its employees in  the appropriate\n     unit.\n          ....\n\n          (c) In  any like or related manner interfering\n     with,  restraining, or  coercing  employees in  the\n     exercise of  the rights guaranteed by  Section 7 of\n     the Act.\n\n     2.  Take the following affirmative action necessary\n     to effectuate the policies of the Act:\n\n          (a)   Upon   request,   bargain   collectively\n     concerning   rates  of   pay,   wages,   hours   of\n     employment,  and  other  terms  and  conditions  of\n     employment with the Union ... and, if an  agreement\n     is reached, embody it in a signed contract.\n\nThe Board contends that the hospital violated the judgment in\n\nOctober  1991 by  unilaterally  implementing a  work-schedule\n\nchange after  speaking directly to the  employees and without\n\nconsulting  the  union.   We  agree  and therefore  find  the\n\nhospital in contempt.\n\n                              I.\r\n\n     The  facts  are undisputed  and straightforward.1   They\n\nderive  entirely from the  hospital's pleadings and exhibits,\n\nparticularly  from  an  affidavit  submitted  by  a  hospital\n\nadministrator  who  was involved  in  union  bargaining.   In\n\nOctober 1991, in order to compensate for a shortage of nurses\n\nand to reduce absenteeism,  the hospital decided to implement\n\nan  extended-work-schedule  program  on  a  voluntary,  trial\n\nbasis.   Under  this  plan, participating  nurses would  work\n\ntwelve-hour shifts  seven times every two  weeks, rather than\n\nthe customary eight-hour  shifts five times  per week.   Some\n\nchanges in  wages and  differentials would also  be involved.\n\nAt the monthly meetings  held in various hospital departments\n\nthat same  month, hospital supervisors presented  the plan to\n\nthe nurses.  No negotiation  occurred over its terms; rather,\n\nthe terms were described and the nurses were given the option\n\nof participating  or not.   An  undisclosed number of  nurses\n\nagreed  to  participate,  each  of  whom  signed  a  document\n\nacknowledging that such participation was voluntary.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Although  the Board  has moved,  in the  alternative, for\nreference to a special  master, it insists that there  are no\nmaterial factual issues  in dispute.   The hospital does  not\ndisagree; in  fact, the hospital  (like the Board)  has moved\nfor summary adjudication.
