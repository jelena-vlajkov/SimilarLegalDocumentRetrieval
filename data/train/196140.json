Two defendants,\r                                                     \r\n\nJ.P. Noonan Transportation, Inc.,  a common carrier, and Aris\r\n\nGetty, Inc., jointly with its owner, George Varelis (\"Aris\"),\r\n\nwere found liable to Getty Petroleum Corporation (\"Getty\"), a\r\n\nwell-known  vendor  of gasoline,  under  the  Lanham Act,  15\r\n\nU.S.C.      1114  and   1125,  for   trademark  infringement.\r\n\nPlaintiff's  damages were  settled via  separate negotiations\r\n\nwith each defendant.   Noonan then cross-claimed against Aris\r\n\nfor  indemnification.   In  a thorough  opinion the  district\r\n\ncourt disagreed and  granted summary judgment  for Aris.   We\r\n\naffirm.\r\n\n          The facts are simple.   In 1981 Varelis formed Aris\r\n\nGetty, Inc., and  was licensed  by Getty to  operate a  Getty\r\n\nfilling station.   It  prominently displayed the  usual Getty\r\n\npole  sign, and  its gasoline  pumps and  service attendants'\r\n\nuniforms  bore the  Getty  name  and  marks.    Aris  had  an\r\n\narrangement with a local distributor to supply  it with Getty\r\n\ngasoline.   In  1984  Aris terminated  its relationship  with\r\n\nGetty  and thereafter  began to  purchase  unbranded gasoline\r\n\nthrough  J.P. Noonan  from  another distributor.   Except  to\r\n\nchange  the markings on its pumps to \"Aris Gas,\" Aris made no\r\n\nchange in  the appearance of its station,  signs, or employee\r\n\nuniforms.\r\n\n          The  court found  that Noonan  \"knowingly delivered\r\n\nunbranded gasoline to Aris Getty\" while fully aware that Aris\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n\"was not an authorized Getty franchise.\"  Although it murmurs\r\n\nat  the  court's  conclusion,  Noonan  knew  that  many  Aris\r\n\ncustomers believed  they were receiving Getty  gasoline.  Any\r\n\nother  contention  would be  fanciful.   Thus,  as  the court\r\n\nfound, Noonan, jointly with Aris, violated the Lanham Act, 15\r\n\nU.S.C.    1114(1),  and  was   contributorially  responsible.\r\n\nInwood Laboratories Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n844 (1982).\r\n\n               [L]iability       for      trademark\r\n          infringement can extend beyond  those who\r\n          actually  mislabel goods with the mark of\r\n          another.  Even if a manufacturer does not\r\n          directly  control others in  the chain of\r\n          distribution, it can be  held responsible\r\n          for  their  infringing  activities  under\r\n          certain  circumstances.     Thus,  if   a\r\n          manufacturer or distributor intentionally\r\n          induces another to infringe  a trademark,\r\n          or if it continues  to supply its product\r\n          to  one whom  it knows  or has  reason to\r\n          know    is    engaging    in    trademark\r\n          infringement,    the   manufacturer    or\r\n          distributor      is      contributorially\r\n          responsible for any harm done as a result\r\n          of the deceit.\r\n\n456 U.S. at 853-54.\r\n\n          It is true that,  as a distributor, Noonan  did not\r\n\nhave title to the  gasoline.  However, it had,  and supplied,\r\n\nan essential factor -- physical possession of the property to\r\n\nwhich the trademark was  to be attached.  Liability  -- which\r\n\nis not questioned -- was thus direct, for an affirmative act,\r\n\nand not merely vicarious by  operation of law for the  act of\r\n\nanother.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n          In this circumstance  Noonan's much  cited case  of\r\n\nGarbincius  v. Boston  Edison Co.,  621  F.2d 1171  (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1980), is of no assistance to it, but quite the contrary.  In\r\n\ngeneral indemnity is not allowed when liability is based upon\r\n\none's own fault.1\r\n\n          Noonan claims  two other  strings to its  bow, both\r\n\nbased  on the great disparity  between Aris's profits and its\r\n\nown meager ones.   We  assume the disparity.2   However,  the\r\n\nMassachusetts court's dictum of a claimed  indemnitee's fault\r\n\nbeing  disregardable in  \"exceptional  cases\" is  limited  to\r\n\nfault that  is  \"insignificant in  relation  to that  of  the\r\n\nindemnitor.\"   Rathbun v. Western Massachusetts Electric Co.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n395 Mass.  361, 364, 479 N.E.2d 1383, 1385 (1985).  We regard\r\n\nthis as  relating to conduct, not  to profits.  We  could not\r\n\nlabel  wrongful   delivery  for  five   years  insignificant.\r\n\nEqually we see  no basis  for Noonan's claim  that its  small\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.        Indemnity is permitted only when one does\r\n          not  join in  the  negligent  act but  is\r\n          exposed   to   derivative  or   vicarious\r\n          liability   for   the  wrongful   act  of\r\n          another.   In  such cases  the  court has\r\n          held  that  plaintiffs  in the  indemnity\r\n          actions  had  no  participation   in  the\r\n          negligence of the defendants.\r\n\nGarbincius, 621 F.2d at 1176 (citation omitted).\r                      \r\n\n2.  How Aris succeeded in obtaining a much smaller settlement\r\nfigure than Noonan  escapes us, but  we think it  irrelevant.\r\nThese were independent agreements, separately arrived at, and\r\nthere  is  no question  of  Noonan's  payment having  reduced\r\nAris's.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nprofits were \"special circumstances\"  that implied a right of\r\n\nindemnity.  If  Noonan wanted protection it could  have asked\r\n\nfor it as part of its contract.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n",

Thus, if a manufacturer or distributor intentionally induces another to infringe a trademark, or if it continues to supply its product to one whom it knows or has reason to know is engaging in trademark infringement, the manufacturer or distributor is contributorially responsible for any harm done as a result of the deceit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">456 U.S. at <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110720\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">853-54,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/110720/inwood-laboratories-inc-v-ives-laboratories-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, it had, and supplied, an essential factor--physical possession of the property to which the trademark was to be attached.  Liability--which is not questioned--was thus direct, for an affirmative act, and not merely vicarious by operation of law for the act of another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this circumstance Noonan's much cited case of Garbincius v. Boston Edison Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"378194\"><a href=\"/opinion/378194/peter-p-garbincius-administrator-of-the-estate-of-paul-c-garbincius-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1171</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1980), is of no assistance to it, but quite the contrary.  In general indemnity is not allowed when liability is based upon one's own fault.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noonan claims two other strings to its bow, both based on the great disparity between Aris's profits and its own meager ones.  We assume the disparity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  However, the Massachusetts court's dictum of a claimed indemnitee's fault being disregardable in \"exceptional cases\" is limited to fault that is \"insignificant in relation to that of the indemnitor.\"  Rathbun v. Western Massachusetts Electric Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2050410\"><a href=\"/opinion/2050410/rathbun-v-western-massachusetts-electric-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span>, 364, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2050410\"><a href=\"/opinion/2050410/rathbun-v-western-massachusetts-electric-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1383</span></a></span>, 1385 (1985).  We regard this as relating to conduct, not to profits.  We could not label wrongful delivery for five years insignificant.  Equally we see no basis for Noonan's claim that its small profits were \"special circumstances\" that implied a right of indemnity.  If Noonan wanted protection it could have asked for it as part of its contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Indemnity is permitted only when one does not join in the negligent act but is exposed to derivative or vicarious liability for the wrongful act of another.
