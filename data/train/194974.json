John McCabe, a prisoner of the commonwealth\n               \n\nof  Massachusetts,  appeals  the  district  court   grant  of\n\ndefendants'  motion  for  summary  judgment  on  his   claims\n\npursuant  to 42 U.S.C.    1983.1  McCabe  alleges that, while\n\nincarcerated at the Treatment  Center for Sexually  Dangerous\n\nPersons  at   Bridgewater,  he  was  subject   to  mechanical\n\nrestraints in  violation of the eighth  amendment prohibition\n\nof  cruel and unusual punishment.  He further alleges that he\n\nwas  deprived of  his constitutional  right of access  to the\n\ncourts because of restrictions placed upon  his access to the\n\nlaw library.\n\n     We believe  that the district court's opinion adequately\n\nsets  forth the  background of this  case, and  that McCabe's\n\nserious assault on a guard amply justified the restraints and\n\ndisposes of the eighth amendment claim.\n\n     As  for the denial of  access to library facilities, the\n\ngravamen  of McCabe's  claim, as  set forth  in his  brief on\n\nappeal, is  that  the  restraints  interfered  with  McCabe's\n\nability  to use the library.   Because McCabe  admits that he\n\nwas not wholly denied  access, he has no claim  under section\n\n1983  without a  showing  of actual  prejudice,  such as  the\n\nforfeit of a case for failure  to meet filing deadlines.  See\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n1.     The   district   court   ordered   plaintiff's  claims\n\"dismissed.\"   However, since the court  explicitly relied on\ndefendant affidavits and on the record, we treat its decision\nas a summary judgment.

But McCabe\n              \n\nfails  to make any such allegation of actual prejudice either\n\nin his complaint or in his brief on appeal.\n\n     Accordingly, we  affirm the district court  on the issue\n\nof  library access for lack of any claim of actual prejudice.\n\nWe  note that McCabe is  now in another  institution, and has\n\nconducted extensive litigation under  new conditions, so that\n\nthe  library  access  problem   of  which  he  complains  has\n\napparently been resolved.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -3-\n",
