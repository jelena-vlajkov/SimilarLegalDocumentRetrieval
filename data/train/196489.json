A tragic sequence of events\r                      LYNCH, Circuit Judge.\r                                          \r\n\nleaving Philip  St. Hilaire  dead from wounds  from a  police\r\n\nbullet  and  leaving  law  enforcement  officers  and   their\r\n\nmunicipal employers sued by his widow brings this case before\r\n\nus.  The district court  entered summary judgment against the\r\n\nwidow's  action under  42  U.S.C.    1983,  finding that  the\r\n\nofficers  were protected  by  qualified immunity.   Mrs.  St.\r\n\nHilaire  appeals,  saying  there  are   genuine  disputes  of\r\n\nmaterial  fact  and  that  the  officers   abrogated  clearly\r\n\nestablished constitutional rights.   We hold that while there\r\n\nare  disputes of fact, those  disputes are not  material.  We\r\n\naffirm  because the  defendants  are  entitled  to  qualified\r\n\nimmunity in that they did not violate any constitutional  law\r\n\nthat  was clearly established at the time of the shooting and\r\n\nthey could reasonably have  believed their search warrant was\r\n\nsupported by probable cause.\r\n\n                            FACTS\r\n\n          Armed  with some evidence (the sufficiency of which\r\n\nplaintiff challenges),  Deputy Robert  Dupuis of the  Belknap\r\n\nCounty Sheriff's Office applied for a search warrant from the\r\n\nlocal  district court to search both the person of Philip St.\r\n\nHilaire  and his  place of  business, Laconia  Auto Wrecking.\r\n\nBased  on  information  from  a  confidential informant,  the\r\n\npolice believed  St. Hilaire  was selling cocaine  at Laconia\r\n\nAuto Wrecking and  that he had just travelled to  New York to\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n\"score\" a load of cocaine.  The warrant issued and the police\r\n\nplanned their operation to execute the search warrant.\r\n\n          It  was  a  joint  operation  between  the  Belknap\r\n\nSheriff's Office, the Belknap  Police and the Laconia Police.\r\n\nThe participants -- defendants  Deputy Dupuis, Deputy  Daniel\r\n\nCollis, Sgt. David Nielsen,  Sgt. Brian Loanes, and Detective\r\n\nDavid Gunter --  met in the early evening  of April 27, 1990.\r\n\nThe police  believed  St. Hilaire  to be  armed and  possibly\r\n\ndangerous.  They knew that St. Hilaire carried a .357 caliber\r\n\nrevolver or a .25 caliber semi-automatic pistol, or both, and\r\n\nthat he had a shotgun  and a crossbow on the premises.   They\r\n\nalso  had  information  that  St. Hilaire  had,  a  few  days\r\n\nearlier, pointed  a gun  at  the head  of  a person  who  had\r\n\nstooped  to pick  up St.  Hilaire's dropped  money bag.   The\r\n\npolice had  also received complaints some  time earlier about\r\n\nthe sounds of shooting from the auto yard.\r\n\n          The  police  were  concerned  about  the reflective\r\n\nglass  on the front of  Laconia Auto Wrecking,  which made it\r\n\ndifficult  for people outside to  see in but  easy for people\r\n\ninside to see  out.  They felt  it would be  a danger to  the\r\n\npolice to approach the front of the building abruptly.\r\n\n          They  decided  that  Deputy  Dupuis  and  Sergeants\r\n\nNielsen   and  Loanes  would   execute  the  search  warrant.\r\n\nDetective Gunter,  stationed across  the street to  help with\r\n\nsurveillance,  would then  come in  with his  drug  dog, Lux.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nDeputy Sheriff  Collis was also stationed  across the street,\r\n\nmonitoring the auto yard, in radio communication with Dupuis.\r\n\nSergeant Nielsen was in uniform; the remaining four defendant\r\n\nofficers  were in plain clothes.   The search  team waited at\r\n\nthe rear of the  building.  Patrolmen in two  marked cruisers\r\n\nwere stationed on the road on either side of the business.  \r\n\n           The  plan was as follows.   The team,  led by Sgt.\r\n\nNielsen would enter the building and then  search St. Hilaire\r\n\nand the building.   If the building was closed,  the officers\r\n\nwould  find a way to  enter or would  wait for St. Hilaire to\r\n\nemerge  and then reach him outside.  They planned to identify\r\n\nthemselves  as  law  enforcement  officers  and  state  their\r\n\npurpose.   Sergeant  Nielsen was  to lead  because he  was in\r\n\nuniform  and St. Hilaire knew him from prior encounters.  The\r\n\nofficers thought  this would be  the safest  way to  proceed.\r\n\nDetective  Gunter testified  that, in  execution of  a search\r\n\nwarrant,  the  best  policy  is  to  make  sure  the  subject\r\n\nunderstands that he is dealing with a police officer.  \r\n\n          Things  did  not  go  according  to  plan.    After\r\n\nwatching  someone else unsuccessfully trying to get in to the\r\n\nbuilding,  Collis concluded  that the  front door  was likely\r\n\nlocked  and radioed  so to  Dupuis.   Dupuis decided  on more\r\n\nmanpower and  called Detective Gunter  over to join  the team\r\n\nwaiting behind  the building.   Collis then  saw St.  Hilaire\r\n\nleave the building with his dog, lock up, and walk toward his\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ncar in the parking  lot.  Collis radioed this  information to\r\n\nDupuis.  \r\n\n          The   team,   waiting   behind  the   auto-wrecking\r\n\nbuilding, decided  to move  in.   Detective  Gunter, who  was\r\n\nclosest  to the  parking  lot, ran  in  front, ahead  of  the\r\n\nothers.   The police rounded  the corner of  the building and\r\n\ntravelled the  roughly 125  feet to the  car in  a period  of\r\n\nseconds, hoping to reach  St. Hilaire before he got  into his\r\n\ncar.  It was not to be.  St.  Hilaire had already put his dog\r\n\nin  the back seat, gotten  into the driver's  seat of his car\r\n\nand  turned on the engine.  Detective Gunter, who was dressed\r\n\nin jeans and a t-shirt, ran up to the car.\r\n\n          St. Hilaire, at  that moment, looked  up and saw  a\r\n\nstranger dressed  in jeans and  a t-shirt, approach  his open\r\n\ncar passenger window, pointing  a .357 magnum revolver toward\r\n\nhim.   St. Hilaire's eyes  widened.  St.  Hilaire reached for\r\n\nhis  own  gun,  or  so  it  appeared   to  Detective  Gunter.\r\n\nDetective Gunter fired a  bullet, hitting St. Hilaire in  the\r\n\nneck.     The  bullet  lodged  in   St.  Hilaire's  vertebra,\r\n\nparalyzing him from the neck down.  \r\n\n          Sergeant Nielsen, in uniform, reached the car next.\r\n\nHe saw  that St. Hilaire's right hand was on  top of a gun on\r\n\nthe car seat.  Sergeant Nielsen told St. Hilaire to let go of\r\n\nthe gun.   St.  Hilaire replied  that he could  not, that  he\r\n\ncould not move.  The police removed the gun.  \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          St. Hilaire  said to  Sgt. Nielsen, \"I  didn't know\r\n\nyou guys were the cops.  Why didn't he identify himself?  Why\r\n\ndidn't  he  say he  was  a  cop?\"    Later, at  the  hospital\r\n\nemergency room,  St. Hilaire  repeatedly told his  nurse, \"He\r\n\ndidn't  identify  himself.\"     St.  Hilaire  made  the  same\r\n\nstatements to his wife.\r\n\n          The police testified, at  deposition, that they did\r\n\nidentify themselves.  Detective Gunter testified that when he\r\n\nwas  halfway to the car  he yelled, \"Phil,  police, Phil\" and\r\n\nthen, at the side of the  car, he yelled \"Hold it.\"   He also\r\n\ntestified,  \"I'm   sure  I  yelled  'police,'   but  I  don't\r\n\nremember.\"   Sergeant  Nielsen said  that he  heard Detective\r\n\nGunter  say, \"Hold  it Phil,  police.   Hold it,  police,\" as\r\n\nDetective Gunter  was about  a foot  away from  the passenger\r\n\nside of  the car.    Deputy Dupuis  said he  was just  behind\r\n\nDetective  Gunter  and  heard  Detective  Gunter yell  \"Phil,\r\n\npolice.\"  Deputy Dupuis  said he also yelled, \"Police\"  as he\r\n\nrounded  the building, some 58  feet from the  car.  Sergeant\r\n\nLoanes  said he  heard  someone say  something like  \"Police,\r\n\nfreeze.\"  Two  other officers, who had been  stationed across\r\n\nthe  street, heard  someone  yell, \"Police.\"    One of  them,\r\n\nCollis,  heard \"Police\" within two seconds of the gunshot.  A\r\n\npassing motorist heard \"Freeze,\" just before seeing the flash\r\n\nof a gun.  Detective Gunter also said he had his police badge\r\n\nheld  in his  extended left  hand as  he approached  the car.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nDupuis  saw  the  badge   in  Detective  Gunter's  left  hand\r\n\nimmediately after the shooting.\r\n\n          Some currency and a bag containing three-fourths of\r\n\nan ounce of cocaine, worth about $2,200, were recovered  from\r\n\nSt. Hilaire's jacket.   St. Hilaire died in October 1991 as a\r\n\nresult  of complications  from  his injuries.   He  was forty\r\n\nyears old.\r\n\n                         LEGAL CLAIMS\r\n\n          Kathy St. Hilaire brought suit individually  and as\r\n\nexecutrix of the estate under 42 U.S.C.   1983 asserting that\r\n\ndefendants  had  violated the  Fourth  Amendment.   She  also\r\n\nbrought pendent state law claims for negligence and negligent\r\n\nand   intentional   infliction    of   emotional    distress.\r\n\nPlaintiff's Fourth  Amendment theories  were that  the search\r\n\nwarrant  was obtained  without  probable cause  and that  the\r\n\ndefendants \"used  unreasonable  force in  executing a  search\r\n\nwarrant upon  her  husband in  that they  failed to  identify\r\n\nthemselves as  police officers and then shot her husband when\r\n\nhe failed to yield.\"\r\n\n          The  district court entered  summary judgment based\r\n\non qualified  immunity.  That  decision is reviewed  de novo.\r                                                                        \r\n\nHegarty v.  Somerset County,  53  F.3d 1367,  1372 (1st  Cir.\r                                       \r\n\n1995)(citing Jirau-Bernal v.

All facts are reviewed in the light most favorable\r\n\nto the party opposing summary judgment.  Id.\r                                                        \r\n\n          The ultimate question  of qualified immunity should\r\n\nordinarily be decided by  the court.1  Hunter v.  Bryant, 502\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S.  224, 228  (1991).   In determining  whether there  is a\r\n\nqualified immunity defense \"the  court should ask whether the\r\n\nagents   acted   reasonably   under  settled   law   in   the\r\n\ncircumstances.\"  Id.  This court has identified two prongs to\r                                \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  While  this court  has not  had the  occasion to  explore\r\nfully  the allocation  of  functions between  judge and  jury\r\nwhere facts relevant to the immunity defense are  in dispute,\r\nwe have said that  \"we doubt the Supreme Court  intended this\r\ndispute to be resolved  from the bench by  fiat.\"  Prokey  v.\r                                                                     \r\nWatkins,  942  F.2d 67,  72 (1st  Cir.  1991).   The ultimate\r                   \r\nquestion of whether a reasonable police officer, on the basis\r\nof information known to him, could have believed his  actions\r\nwere in accord with  constitutional rights is \"a question  of\r\nlaw, subject to resolution by the  judge not the jury.\"   Id.\r                                                                        \r\nat 73.   But  if there  is a  factual dispute,  \"that factual\r\ndispute must be resolved by a fact finder.\"  Id.  The precise\r                                                           \r\nquestion of  whether the  judge may intercede  and play  that\r\nfact  finder role appears not to have been clearly decided by\r\nthe Supreme Court.   Some courts, consonant  with the Seventh\r\nAmendment, have  preserved the  fact finding function  of the\r\njury through special  interrogatories to the  jury as to  the\r\ndisputes of  fact, reserving the ultimate law question to the\r\njudge.

In any\r\nevent,  we draw on the cases decided in the liability context\r\nfor  guidance in  deciding  the qualified  immunity question.\r\nSee, e.g., Graham v.

Without such a  rule, the Court\r                    \r\n\nsaid, \"[a] passably clever plaintiff would always be able  to\r\n\nidentify  an  abstract  clearly established  right  that  the\r\n\ndefendant could be alleged to have violated,\" id. at 640 n.2,\r                                                             \r\n\nand so defeat summary judgment.3\r\n\n          The Court  has  also warned  against requiring  too\r\n\ngreat  a specificity  in the  \"clearly established  law\" such\r\n\nthat the officer would  be granted qualified immunity \"unless\r\n\nthe  very  action  in  question ha[d]  previously  been  held\r\n\nunlawful.\"   Anderson, 483 U.S.  at 640.   An earlier warning\r                                 \r\n\nagainst  exactly  such  a  misapplication  of  the  qualified\r\n\nimmunity doctrine was given in  Mitchell v.

Similarly, we note, a  \"passably clever\" defendant  might\r\ncharacterize the right involved in such broad terms as to say\r\nsuch  a  broad articulation  could  not  permit a  reasonable\r\nofficial  to understand that  what he is  doing violates that\r\nright and so the right was not \"clearly established.\"\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          or suit for  a warrantless search  merely\r\n          because the warrant requirement has never\r\n          explicitly been held to apply to a search\r\n          conducted in identical circumstances.\r\n\n472 U.S. at  535 n.12.   The proper  characterization of  the\r\n\n\"clearly established law\" is implicated in this case.  \r\n\nThe Shooting\r                        \r\n\n          Plaintiff asserts two Fourth Amendment  theories as\r\n\nto  the shooting,  both independent  of her  Fourth Amendment\r\n\nclaim  as  to  the  warrant.    Plaintiff  argues  that \"[n]o\r\n\nreasonable  law  enforcement  agent  could  believe  that  in\r\n\nexecuting  a search warrant the law allowed him to surprise a\r\n\nsuspect on a  dead run, in plain  clothes, with gun drawn  at\r\n\nclose range,  and not  provide that individual  with adequate\r\n\nand  reasonable  notice  of   his  identity  and  his  lawful\r\n\npurpose.\"  Plaintiff  also argues  that the  facts of  record\r\n\n\"are sufficient to raise  a material and genuine issue  as to\r\n\nwhether  [Detective] Gunter  had a  reasonable belief  he was\r\n\nacting  in self defense.\"  She claims that the \"resolution of\r\n\nthese issues is an inherently  fact-based matter for the jury\r\n\nas  no other  officers  observed the  alleged conduct  of St.\r\n\nHilaire in reaching for the weapon.\"  The latter claim is, we\r\n\nbelieve,  without merit.   The first  claim, that  the police\r\n\nwere  required   to  identify  themselves  and  their  lawful\r\n\npurpose, however, raises difficult issues.\r\n\n          Plaintiff argues that summary judgment was improper\r\n\nbecause  there were material facts in dispute.  We agree that\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nthere is, on the record, a dispute of fact as  to whether the\r\n\npolice did  identify themselves.  St.  Hilaire's first words,\r\n\nas he sat with a bullet hole in his neck, were to ask why the\r\n\npolice  had  not identified  themselves.    He repeated  this\r\n\nquestion at the  hospital and  told his nurses  and his  wife\r\n\nthat the  police  did  not  identify themselves.    While  an\r\n\ninference  can be drawn from  the deposition testimony of the\r\n\nofficers   that   St. Hilaire  simply   did   not   hear  the\r\n\nidentifications  given  by   the  police,  another  plausible\r\n\ninference could be  drawn that  the police  did not  identify\r\n\nthemselves.   A  passing motorist  who  heard the  police say\r\n\n\"freeze\" did  not hear the word  \"police\" mentioned, although\r\n\nthe  police  testimony is  that  the two  words  were uttered\r\n\ntogether.   Where  \"inferences to  be drawn  from the  web of\r\n\nfacts are disputed and unclear -- and are likely to depend on\r\n\ncredibility  judgments,\" there is a  dispute of fact.  Prokey\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

In summary  judgment terms, the disputed  fact must\r\n\nbe  material.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,\r                                                          \r\n\n248  (1986).  In the context of a qualified immunity defense,\r\n\nthe  legal  questions  for  the  court  to  decide  may  well\r\n\ndetermine if  the dispute  is material.   Here,  the district\r\n\ncourt acknowledged that the plaintiff's argument raised \"more\r\n\ntroubling  questions.\"    The  court  also  assumed,  without\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\ndeciding, that plaintiff had raised a genuine factual dispute\r\n\nas  to  whether  defendants  identified  themselves  as  they\r\n\napproached St.  Hilaire's vehicle.

It  reasoned  that  St.\r\n\nHilaire's Fourth  Amendment rights  did not attach  until the\r\n\nseizure  actually occurred and  that the shooting constituted\r\n\nthe seizure.   Id. at 357  n.3.  It  reasoned that the  issue\r                              \r\n\nbefore  it  was  whether  there  was  a  clearly  established\r\n\nobligation  under  the  Fourth   Amendment  for  police   not\r\n\nunreasonably to create circumstances  where the use of deadly\r\n\nforce  becomes   necessary  and  if  so,   whether  any  such\r\n\nobligation was  \"clearly established.\"   Id. at  356-57.

We believe that view is inconsistent\r\n\nwith Supreme  Court  decisions  and  with  the  law  of  this\r\n\nCircuit.   The Supreme Court in  Brower v.

The question before the\r\nSupreme  Court  in  Hodari  was whether  the  defendant,  who\r                                      \r\ndiscarded  cocaine while  being pursued  by police,  had been\r\n\"seized\" at the time he dropped the drugs, for the purpose of\r\ndetermining whether the  drugs were the  fruit of an  illegal\r\nseizure.  Id. at 623.  Thus, the question was not whether the\r                         \r\nseizure was reasonable, which  requires an examination of the\r                                  \r\ntotality of  the circumstances, but whether there  had been a\r\nseizure  at all.   We  do not  read this  case  as forbidding\r\ncourts from examining circumstances  leading up to a seizure,\r\nonce  it is established  that there has  been a  seizure.

In Hegarty,  this  court examined  each  of  the\r                                   \r\n\nactions leading up  to the  mortal wounding of  a woman  whom\r\n\npolice  officers  were attempting  to  arrest  for recklessly\r\n\nendangering the  safety  of  four campers.    53  F.3d  1367.\r\n\nInstead  of focusing solely  on whether the  officer who shot\r\n\nHegarty  was acting  in  self-defense at  the  moment of  the\r\n\nshooting (Hegarty had picked  up a rifle and raised it in the\r\n\ndirection of the  officers and ignored their demands  to drop\r\n\nit), the court examined all of the actions of the officers to\r\n\ndetermine whether there was  probable cause to arrest Hegarty\r\n\nand  whether  there were  exigent  circumstances  to allow  a\r\n\nforcible,  warrantless, nighttime  entry  into her  dwelling.\r\n\nId.  at 1374-79.  Similarly,  in Roy v.  Lewiston, this court\r                                                             \r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nexamined all of the surrounding  circumstances in determining\r\n\nwhether  the police  acted reasonably:    \"Roy was  armed; he\r\n\napparently  tried to  kick  and strike  at  the officers;  he\r\n\ndisobeyed repeated instructions to  put down the weapons; and\r\n\nthe officers had other reasons . . . for thinking him capable\r\n\nof assault.\"  42 F.3d at 695.\r\n\n          This focus on  the moment of  the shooting led  the\r\n\ndistrict court to conclude that  the issue was whether  there\r\n\nwas any  clearly established constitutional duty  on the part\r\n\nof police  to avoid  creating situations which  increased the\r\n\nrisk  of use of deadly  force.  The  district court concluded\r\n\nthere was no such  generalized duty.  Cf. Carter  v. Buscher,\r                                                                        \r\n\n973  F.2d 1328,  1331-33 (7th Cir.  1992) (reading  Brower to\r                                                                      \r\n\nmean that courts should consider reasonableness of seizure in\r\n\ntotality of circumstances, but should not consider whether it\r\n\nwas reasonable  for the police to  create the circumstances).\r\n\nBut  at the  core  of  plaintiff's  case  is  not  the  broad\r\n\ncontention that the police have a duty to reduce the risk  of\r\n\nviolence.  Such a  contention itself creates a risk  that the\r\n\n\"duty\"  is so broadly defined that it gives inadequate notice\r\n\nof  what would violate the  duty and thus  would fall back on\r\n\nwhether those specific  facts have occurred  in the case  law\r\n\nbefore.   Plaintiff instead  makes a narrower,  more specific\r\n\nclaim.  \r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n          Plaintiff  contends  that  in  executing  a  search\r\n\nwarrant,   the   Fourth   Amendment's   prohibition   against\r\n\n\"unreasonable  searches\"  requires  the  police  to  identify\r\n\nthemselves as  police and state their  purpose.5  Plaintiff's\r\n\ntheory  is  that  if   the  police  had  properly  identified\r\n\nthemselves, St.  Hilaire would  have known they  were police,\r\n\nwould not have himself felt endangered when he saw a stranger\r\n\napproach  with a gun in his hand,  and that St. Hilaire would\r\n\nnot have made a movement in the direction of his gun.   It is\r\n\nthat  movement  which led  Detective Gunter  to fire  his own\r\n\nweapon.  There is  some additional support in the  record for\r\n\nplaintiff's theory.  St. Hilaire and the police had had prior\r\n\ndealings.  In each, the police identified themselves and  St.\r\n\nHilaire did not threaten them.\r\n\n          It  falls to  the court  to determine  whether this\r\n\nright allegedly  violated  was \"clearly  established\" at  the\r\n\ntime of the incident.  \"Whether an asserted federal right was\r\n\nclearly established  at a particular  time, so that  a public\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Plaintiff  relies  on Tennessee  v.  Garner,  471 U.S.  1\r                                                           \r\n(1985), which held that the Fourth Amendment prohibits use of\r\ndeadly  force to prevent the  escape of an apparently unarmed\r\nsuspected felon unless it is  necessary to prevent the escape\r\nand  the  officer  has  probable cause  to  believe  that the\r\nsuspect  poses  a  significant  threat of  death  or  serious\r\nphysical injury  to the  officer or  others.   Garner  indeed\r                                                                 \r\nestablishes that \"apprehension by the  use of deadly force is\r\na seizure  subject to  the reasonableness requirement  of the\r\nFourth Amendment.\"  Id. at 6.  But Garner, while helpful, did\r                                                     \r\nnot resolve immunity issues  in that case, nor does  it do so\r\nhere.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nofficial who  allegedly violated  the right has  no qualified\r\n\nimmunity  from suit, presents a question of law.\"  Elder, 114\r                                                                    \r\n\nS. Ct. at 1022.\r\n\n          Plaintiff  relies on  the  Supreme  Court's  recent\r\n\ndecision in Wilson v. Arkansas, 115 S.

See\r                                                                         \r\n\nDavis v.

Fourth  Amendment  law  in  some  contexts  recognizes  a\r\ndistinction  between a person's home and a person's car.  For\r\nexample,  the  Fourth Amendment  permits  a slightly  broader\r\nsearch  pursuant to the arrest  of the occupant  of a vehicle\r\nand some warrantless searches  of vehicles are permitted even\r\nif  there are not  emergency circumstances.   See generally 1\r                                                                       \r\nWayne  R. LaFave &amp; Jerold H.

One  explanation  for the  different protection  of\r\nitems  found  in  vehicles  is  that  \"[o]ne   has  a  lesser\r\nexpectation  of  privacy  in  a  motor  vehicle  because  its\r\nfunction  is transportation  and  it seldom  serves as  one's\r\nresidence or  as the repository of  personal effects . .  . .\r\nIt travels public thoroughfares  where both its occupants and\r\nits  contents are in plain view.\"  United States v.

Thus, in order\r                                     \r\n\nfor  the plaintiff  to prevail,  the notice  requirement must\r\n\nhave   been   clearly   rooted   in  the   Fourth   Amendment\r\n\njurisprudence in 1990.  Plaintiff's argument fails because at\r\n\nthe  time  of the  shooting  the notice  requirement  was not\r\n\nclearly of constitutional dimension.\r\n\n          The  Court  in  Wilson  noted that  it  had  \"never\r                                            \r\n\nsquarely   held  that   this  [common   law]  principle   [of\r\n\nannouncement]  is an  element of  the reasonableness  inquiry\r\n\nunder  the  Fourth Amendment.\"    115 S.

The Court noted  that in California  and Illinois, it\r\n\nhad  been so  held, but  in Massachusetts,  it had  been held\r\n\nmerely a rule of  common law, not constitutionally compelled.\r\n\nId. at 1916 n.1.  The highest court in New Hampshire had held\r               \r\n\nonly  that there was a common law rule that \"police officers,\r\n\nbefore forcibly entering  a dwelling, should  knock, identify\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nthemselves and their purpose,  and demand admittance.\"  State\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

A  confidential  informant\r\n\ntold Deputy Dupuis that St. Hilaire was selling  cocaine from\r\n\nLaconia Auto Wrecking,  which was owned  and operated by  St.\r\n\nHilaire.  Dupuis consulted with detectives at the Laconia and\r\n\nBelmont  Police   Departments   who  had   worked  with   the\r\n\nconfidential informant on prior occasions.

The district court  entered summary judgment against the\r\n\nwidow's  action under  42  U.S.C.    1983,  finding that  the\r\n\nofficers  were protected  by  qualified immunity.   Mrs.  St.\r\n\nHilaire  appeals,  saying  there  are   genuine  disputes  of\r\n\nmaterial  fact  and  that  the  officers   abrogated  clearly\r\n\nestablished constitutional rights.   We hold that while there\r\n\nare  disputes of fact, those  disputes are not  material.  We\r\n\naffirm  because the  defendants  are  entitled  to  qualified\r\n\nimmunity in that they did not violate any constitutional  law\r\n\nthat  was clearly established at the time of the shooting and\r\n\nthey could reasonably have  believed their search warrant was\r\n\nsupported by probable cause.\r\n\n                            FACTS\r\n\n          Armed  with some evidence (the sufficiency of which\r\n\nplaintiff challenges),  Deputy Robert  Dupuis of the  Belknap\r\n\nCounty Sheriff's Office applied for a search warrant from the\r\n\nlocal  district court to search both the person of Philip St.\r\n\nHilaire  and his  place of  business, Laconia  Auto Wrecking.\r\n\nBased  on  information  from  a  confidential informant,  the\r\n\npolice believed  St. Hilaire  was selling cocaine  at Laconia\r\n\nAuto Wrecking and  that he had just travelled to  New York to\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n\"score\" a load of cocaine.  The warrant issued and the police\r\n\nplanned their operation to execute the search warrant.\r\n\n          It  was  a  joint  operation  between  the  Belknap\r\n\nSheriff's Office, the Belknap  Police and the Laconia Police.\r\n\nThe participants -- defendants  Deputy Dupuis, Deputy  Daniel\r\n\nCollis, Sgt. David Nielsen,  Sgt. Brian Loanes, and Detective\r\n\nDavid Gunter --  met in the early evening  of April 27, 1990.\r\n\nThe police  believed  St. Hilaire  to be  armed and  possibly\r\n\ndangerous.  They knew that St. Hilaire carried a .357 caliber\r\n\nrevolver or a .25 caliber semi-automatic pistol, or both, and\r\n\nthat he had a shotgun  and a crossbow on the premises.   They\r\n\nalso  had  information  that  St. Hilaire  had,  a  few  days\r\n\nearlier, pointed  a gun  at  the head  of  a person  who  had\r\n\nstooped  to pick  up St.  Hilaire's dropped  money bag.   The\r\n\npolice had  also received complaints some  time earlier about\r\n\nthe sounds of shooting from the auto yard.\r\n\n          The  police  were  concerned  about  the reflective\r\n\nglass  on the front of  Laconia Auto Wrecking,  which made it\r\n\ndifficult  for people outside to  see in but  easy for people\r\n\ninside to see  out.  They felt  it would be  a danger to  the\r\n\npolice to approach the front of the building abruptly.\r\n\n          They  decided  that  Deputy  Dupuis  and  Sergeants\r\n\nNielsen   and  Loanes  would   execute  the  search  warrant.\r\n\nDetective Gunter,  stationed across  the street to  help with\r\n\nsurveillance,  would then  come in  with his  drug  dog, Lux.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nDeputy Sheriff  Collis was also stationed  across the street,\r\n\nmonitoring the auto yard, in radio communication with Dupuis.\r\n\nSergeant Nielsen was in uniform; the remaining four defendant\r\n\nofficers  were in plain clothes.   The search  team waited at\r\n\nthe rear of the  building.  Patrolmen in two  marked cruisers\r\n\nwere stationed on the road on either side of the business.  \r\n\n           The  plan was as follows.   The team,  led by Sgt.\r\n\nNielsen would enter the building and then  search St. Hilaire\r\n\nand the building.   If the building was closed,  the officers\r\n\nwould  find a way to  enter or would  wait for St. Hilaire to\r\n\nemerge  and then reach him outside.  They planned to identify\r\n\nthemselves  as  law  enforcement  officers  and  state  their\r\n\npurpose.   Sergeant  Nielsen was  to lead  because he  was in\r\n\nuniform  and St. Hilaire knew him from prior encounters.  The\r\n\nofficers thought  this would be  the safest  way to  proceed.\r\n\nDetective  Gunter testified  that, in  execution of  a search\r\n\nwarrant,  the  best  policy  is  to  make  sure  the  subject\r\n\nunderstands that he is dealing with a police officer.  \r\n\n          Things  did  not  go  according  to  plan.    After\r\n\nwatching  someone else unsuccessfully trying to get in to the\r\n\nbuilding,  Collis concluded  that the  front door  was likely\r\n\nlocked  and radioed  so to  Dupuis.   Dupuis decided  on more\r\n\nmanpower and  called Detective Gunter  over to join  the team\r\n\nwaiting behind  the building.   Collis then  saw St.  Hilaire\r\n\nleave the building with his dog, lock up, and walk toward his\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ncar in the parking  lot.  Collis radioed this  information to\r\n\nDupuis.  \r\n\n          The   team,   waiting   behind  the   auto-wrecking\r\n\nbuilding, decided  to move  in.   Detective  Gunter, who  was\r\n\nclosest  to the  parking  lot, ran  in  front, ahead  of  the\r\n\nothers.   The police rounded  the corner of  the building and\r\n\ntravelled the  roughly 125  feet to the  car in  a period  of\r\n\nseconds, hoping to reach  St. Hilaire before he got  into his\r\n\ncar.  It was not to be.  St.  Hilaire had already put his dog\r\n\nin  the back seat, gotten  into the driver's  seat of his car\r\n\nand  turned on the engine.  Detective Gunter, who was dressed\r\n\nin jeans and a t-shirt, ran up to the car.\r\n\n          St. Hilaire, at  that moment, looked  up and saw  a\r\n\nstranger dressed  in jeans and  a t-shirt, approach  his open\r\n\ncar passenger window, pointing  a .357 magnum revolver toward\r\n\nhim.   St. Hilaire's eyes  widened.  St.  Hilaire reached for\r\n\nhis  own  gun,  or  so  it  appeared   to  Detective  Gunter.\r\n\nDetective Gunter fired a  bullet, hitting St. Hilaire in  the\r\n\nneck.     The  bullet  lodged  in   St.  Hilaire's  vertebra,\r\n\nparalyzing him from the neck down.  \r\n\n          Sergeant Nielsen, in uniform, reached the car next.\r\n\nHe saw  that St. Hilaire's right hand was on  top of a gun on\r\n\nthe car seat.  Sergeant Nielsen told St. Hilaire to let go of\r\n\nthe gun.   St.  Hilaire replied  that he could  not, that  he\r\n\ncould not move.  The police removed the gun.  \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          St. Hilaire  said to  Sgt. Nielsen, \"I  didn't know\r\n\nyou guys were the cops.  Why didn't he identify himself?  Why\r\n\ndidn't  he  say he  was  a  cop?\"    Later, at  the  hospital\r\n\nemergency room,  St. Hilaire  repeatedly told his  nurse, \"He\r\n\ndidn't  identify  himself.\"     St.  Hilaire  made  the  same\r\n\nstatements to his wife.\r\n\n          The police testified, at  deposition, that they did\r\n\nidentify themselves.  Detective Gunter testified that when he\r\n\nwas  halfway to the car  he yelled, \"Phil,  police, Phil\" and\r\n\nthen, at the side of the  car, he yelled \"Hold it.\"   He also\r\n\ntestified,  \"I'm   sure  I  yelled  'police,'   but  I  don't\r\n\nremember.\"   Sergeant  Nielsen said  that he  heard Detective\r\n\nGunter  say, \"Hold  it Phil,  police.   Hold it,  police,\" as\r\n\nDetective Gunter  was about  a foot  away from  the passenger\r\n\nside of  the car.    Deputy Dupuis  said he  was just  behind\r\n\nDetective  Gunter  and  heard  Detective  Gunter yell  \"Phil,\r\n\npolice.\"  Deputy Dupuis  said he also yelled, \"Police\"  as he\r\n\nrounded  the building, some 58  feet from the  car.  Sergeant\r\n\nLoanes  said he  heard  someone say  something like  \"Police,\r\n\nfreeze.\"  Two  other officers, who had been  stationed across\r\n\nthe  street, heard  someone  yell, \"Police.\"    One of  them,\r\n\nCollis,  heard \"Police\" within two seconds of the gunshot.  A\r\n\npassing motorist heard \"Freeze,\" just before seeing the flash\r\n\nof a gun.  Detective Gunter also said he had his police badge\r\n\nheld  in his  extended left  hand as  he approached  the car.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nDupuis  saw  the  badge   in  Detective  Gunter's  left  hand\r\n\nimmediately after the shooting.\r\n\n          Some currency and a bag containing three-fourths of\r\n\nan ounce of cocaine, worth about $2,200, were recovered  from\r\n\nSt. Hilaire's jacket.   St. Hilaire died in October 1991 as a\r\n\nresult  of complications  from  his injuries.   He  was forty\r\n\nyears old.\r\n\n                         LEGAL CLAIMS\r\n\n          Kathy St. Hilaire brought suit individually  and as\r\n\nexecutrix of the estate under 42 U.S.C.   1983 asserting that\r\n\ndefendants  had  violated the  Fourth  Amendment.   She  also\r\n\nbrought pendent state law claims for negligence and negligent\r\n\nand   intentional   infliction    of   emotional    distress.\r\n\nPlaintiff's Fourth  Amendment theories  were that  the search\r\n\nwarrant  was obtained  without  probable cause  and that  the\r\n\ndefendants \"used  unreasonable  force in  executing a  search\r\n\nwarrant upon  her  husband in  that they  failed to  identify\r\n\nthemselves as  police officers and then shot her husband when\r\n\nhe failed to yield.\"\r\n\n          The  district court entered  summary judgment based\r\n\non qualified  immunity.  That  decision is reviewed  de novo.\r                                                                        \r\n\nHegarty v.

The proper  characterization of  the\r\n\n\"clearly established law\" is implicated in this case.  \r\n\nThe Shooting\r                        \r\n\n          Plaintiff asserts two Fourth Amendment  theories as\r\n\nto  the shooting,  both independent  of her  Fourth Amendment\r\n\nclaim  as  to  the  warrant.    Plaintiff  argues  that \"[n]o\r\n\nreasonable  law  enforcement  agent  could  believe  that  in\r\n\nexecuting  a search warrant the law allowed him to surprise a\r\n\nsuspect on a  dead run, in plain  clothes, with gun drawn  at\r\n\nclose range,  and not  provide that individual  with adequate\r\n\nand  reasonable  notice  of   his  identity  and  his  lawful\r\n\npurpose.\"  Plaintiff  also argues  that the  facts of  record\r\n\n\"are sufficient to raise  a material and genuine issue  as to\r\n\nwhether  [Detective] Gunter  had a  reasonable belief  he was\r\n\nacting  in self defense.\"  She claims that the \"resolution of\r\n\nthese issues is an inherently  fact-based matter for the jury\r\n\nas  no other  officers  observed the  alleged conduct  of St.\r\n\nHilaire in reaching for the weapon.\"  The latter claim is, we\r\n\nbelieve,  without merit.   The first  claim, that  the police\r\n\nwere  required   to  identify  themselves  and  their  lawful\r\n\npurpose, however, raises difficult issues.\r\n\n          Plaintiff argues that summary judgment was improper\r\n\nbecause  there were material facts in dispute.  We agree that\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nthere is, on the record, a dispute of fact as  to whether the\r\n\npolice did  identify themselves.  St.  Hilaire's first words,\r\n\nas he sat with a bullet hole in his neck, were to ask why the\r\n\npolice  had  not identified  themselves.    He repeated  this\r\n\nquestion at the  hospital and  told his nurses  and his  wife\r\n\nthat the  police  did  not  identify themselves.    While  an\r\n\ninference  can be drawn from  the deposition testimony of the\r\n\nofficers   that   St. Hilaire  simply   did   not   hear  the\r\n\nidentifications  given  by   the  police,  another  plausible\r\n\ninference could be  drawn that  the police  did not  identify\r\n\nthemselves.   A  passing motorist  who  heard the  police say\r\n\n\"freeze\" did  not hear the word  \"police\" mentioned, although\r\n\nthe  police  testimony is  that  the two  words  were uttered\r\n\ntogether.   Where  \"inferences to  be drawn  from the  web of\r\n\nfacts are disputed and unclear -- and are likely to depend on\r\n\ncredibility  judgments,\" there is a  dispute of fact.

Such a  contention itself creates a risk  that the\r\n\n\"duty\"  is so broadly defined that it gives inadequate notice\r\n\nof  what would violate the  duty and thus  would fall back on\r\n\nwhether those specific  facts have occurred  in the case  law\r\n\nbefore.

It is\r\n\nthat  movement  which led  Detective Gunter  to fire  his own\r\n\nweapon.  There is  some additional support in the  record for\r\n\nplaintiff's theory.  St. Hilaire and the police had had prior\r\n\ndealings.  In each, the police identified themselves and  St.\r\n\nHilaire did not threaten them.\r\n\n          It  falls to  the court  to determine  whether this\r\n\nright allegedly  violated  was \"clearly  established\" at  the\r\n\ntime of the incident.  \"Whether an asserted federal right was\r\n\nclearly established  at a particular  time, so that  a public\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.
