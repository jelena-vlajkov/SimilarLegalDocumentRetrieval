This  is an  appeal from  a\n                              \n\npreliminary   injunction   issued   pursuant   to   the   Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C.   621 et\n                                                             \n\nseq.,   prohibiting  defendants-appellants   Commonwealth  of\n    \n\nMassachusetts, Thomas Rapone, Secretary of Public Safety, and\n\nFrancis  McCauley, Executive  Director  of the  Massachusetts\n\nRetirement  Board,  from enforcing  the  statutorily mandated\n\nretirement of members of the Department of  State Police aged\n\n55 or older.  For the reasons set forth below, we affirm. \n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                      Factual Background\n                                        \n\n          In  December  1991,  the Massachusetts  legislature\n\nenacted  1991 Mass.  Acts ch. 412  (effective July  1, 1992),\n\nwhich  called  for,  inter  alia, the  consolidation  of  the\n                                \n\nCommonwealth's largest police  force, the  Division of  State\n\nPolice,  with  its  three  smaller  forces, the  Metropolitan\n\nDistrict  Commission Police  (\"MDC\"),  the Registry  of Motor\n\nVehicles  Law  Enforcement  Division  (\"Registry\"),  and  the\n\nCapitol  Police.   The  newly  consolidated  police force  is\n\nreferred to as the \"Department of State Police.\"1 \n\n          Prior to  the consolidation,  officers of  the MDC,\n\nRegistry,  and Capitol  Police  were subject  to a  mandatory\n\nretirement age of 65,  and officers of the Division  of State\n\n                    \n\n1.  For purposes of clarity, however, throughout this opinion\nwe  refer  to  the new  Department  of  State  Police as  the\n\"Consolidated Department.\"\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nPolice  were  subject to  a mandatory  retirement age  of 50.\n\nSection   122  of  Chapter   412  repealed   those  mandatory\n\nretirement  ages  and  declared   that  all  members  of  the\n\nConsolidated  Department who reach their fifty-fifth birthday\n\non or before December 31, 1992, shall retire by that date.\n\n          On December 21, 1992, ten days before the effective\n\ndate of the new mandatory retirement age, plaintiffs, members\n\nof  the former  MDC and  Registry divisions,2  commenced this\n\naction seeking  injunctive relief on the grounds that the new\n\nmandatory  retirement age violated the ADEA.  See 29 U.S.C.  \n                                                 \n\n623(a)(1).  On December  30, 1992, after a hearing  that same\n\ndate, the district court issued an order granting plaintiffs'\n\nmotion  for preliminary  injunctive  relief.   See Gately  v.\n                                                         \n\nMassachusetts,  811 F. Supp. 26 (D. Mass. 1992).  This appeal\n             \n\nfollowed.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n             The Preliminary Injunction Standard\n                                                \n\n          In   deciding  whether   to  grant   a  preliminary\n\ninjunction, a  district court  must weigh the  following four\n\nfactors:  (1) the likelihood  of the movant's  success on the\n\nmerits; (2) the potential for irreparable harm to the movant;\n\n(3) a balancing of the relevant equities, i.e., \"the hardship\n                                              \n\nto the nonmovant if the  restrainer issues as contrasted with\n\n                    \n\n2.  The complaint lists  45 officers, 30 of whom  reached the\nage of 55 or older on December 31, 1992.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nthe hardship to  the movant if  interim relief is  withheld,\"\n\nNarragansett Indian  Tribe v.  Guilbert, 934 F.2d  4, 5  (1st\n                                       \n\nCir. 1991);  and (4) the effect  on the public interest  of a\n\ngrant or denial of the injunction.  See, e.g., id.   However,\n                                                  \n\nthe \"sine qua non of [the preliminary injunction standard] is\n                 \n\nwhether the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on  the merits.\"\n\nWeaver v. Henderson, 984  F.2d 11, 12  (1st Cir. 1993).   See\n                                                             \n\nalso  United Steelworkers  of America  v. Textron,  Inc., 836\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 6,  7  (1st Cir.  1987)  (\"The heart  of the  matter  is\n\nwhether `the harm caused plaintiff without the injunction, in\n                                                             \n\nlight of  the plaintiff's  likelihood of eventual  success on\n        \n\nthe  merits, outweighs  the  harm the  injunction will  cause\n\ndefendants.'\")  (quoting Vargas-Figueroa v. Saldana, 826 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n160, 162 (1st Cir. 1987) (emphasis in original)).  \n\n          A  party  appealing   a  grant  of  a   preliminary\n\ninjunction  bears  the  heavy  burden  of  showing  that  the\n\ndistrict  court either committed  a mistake of  law or abused\n\nits discretion.  Guilbert,  934 F.2d at  5.  See also  K-Mart\n                                                             \n\nCorp.  v.

Without such a showing, we will not disturb the\n\nruling below.  Id.\n                  \n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          Here, the district court weighed  the four criteria\n\nrecited above  and held that the scales tipped in favor of an\n\ninjunction.  See Gately, 811 F. Supp. at 27-31.  Although the\n                       \n\ncourt  admitted that  the  evidence relative  to the  second,\n\nthird, and fourth criteria was not markedly in either party's\n\nfavor,  it found that plaintiffs would  likely succeed on the\n\nmerits.  Id.  at 31.   Accordingly, it  issued the  requested\n            \n\npreliminary injunction. \n\n          On  appeal,  defendants  generally   challenge  the\n\ncourt's application  of all  four criteria.   Having reviewed\n\nthe district court's opinion, however, it is clear to us that\n\nappellate elaboration is  warranted only as to  the first and\n\nsecond  criteria.   We therefore  adopt the  district court's\n\ncogent and well-reasoned opinion insofar as it relates to the\n\nother two prongs of the preliminary injunction test and focus\n\non  whether  the  court  correctly  presaged (a)  plaintiffs'\n\nlikelihood  of success at  trial, and  (b) the  potential for\n\nirreparable  harm   to  plaintiffs  in  the   absence  of  an\n\ninjunction.\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\nA.  Plaintiffs' Likelihood of Success\n                                     \n\n          Under the ADEA, it is \"unlawful for an employer . .\n\n. to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or\n\notherwise discriminate  against any individual .  . . because\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nof such individual's  age . .  . .\"   29 U.S.C.    623(a)(1).\n\nThe ADEA  contains an \"escape clause,\"  however, which allows\n\nemployers  some   limited  flexibility  to   take  age   into\n\nconsideration in business decisions.  Commonly referred to as\n\nthe \"BFOQ  exception,\" the  clause allows employers  \"to take\n\nany action  otherwise prohibited under  [the statute]  . .  .\n\nwhere  age   is  a   bona  fide   occupational  qualification\n\nreasonably necessary to the  normal operation of a particular\n\nbusiness . . . .\"   29 U.S.C.    623(f)(1).  As noted by  the\n\nSupreme Court, this clause is \"`an extremely narrow exception\n\nto the general  prohibition' of age  discrimination contained\n\nin the ADEA.\"  Western Air Lines, Inc. v.

We reversed,\n\nholding that the age qualification  applied to all members of\n\nthe state  police, regardless of  whether they  had field  or\n\ndesk jobs.  Trabucco I, 738 F.2d at 39 (phrase \"`occupational\n                      \n\nqualification'  means  more  of  a  recognized  and  discrete\n\nvocation  rather  than  a  desk assignment  for  an  employee\n\nsubject  to  all the  obligations  and benefits  of  a quasi-\n\nmilitary  organization\").  Our decision left intact, however,\n\nthe  district court's finding that age  50 was a BFOQ for the\n\nDivision of State Police.  Id. at 37.\n                              \n\n          After  the district  court ruling,  but before  our\n\nreversal,  the EEOC  brought an  action challenging  the very\n\nsame  mandatory  retirement  statute.    The district  court,\n\nrelying upon Trabucco I, held that the  action was foreclosed\n                       \n\nby  principles  of  stare  decisis.    On  appeal,  the  EEOC\n                                  \n\ncontended  that,  because  plaintiff Mahoney  had  offered no\n\nevidence at trial to  rebut the Commonwealth's BFOQ evidence,\n\nthe  decision lacked  precedential value.   Trabucco  II, 791\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at  4.  No facts had changed and  the EEOC argued no new\n\nlaw.   It  simply contended  that it  would offer  the expert\n\ntestimony that  had not been presented  by plaintiff Mahoney.\n\nAlthough recognizing the \"non-absoluteness of stare decisis,\"\n                                                           \n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nid.  at 4, we analyzed  the proceedings below  and found that\n   \n\nMahoney raised  and argued,  and the district  court decided,\n\nthe precise question of whether the across-the-board BFOQ was\n\nvalid.  Id. at  4-5 (\"Thus, the issue in the case  at bar was\n           \n\naddressed  by  Mahoney in  his  litigation,  even if  not  as\n\nthoroughly as the EEOC  would have desired.\").  As  a result,\n\nwe  rejected  the  EEOC's   attempt  to  reopen  that  issue.\n\nTrabucco II, 791 F.2d at 4-5 (\"We have found no case, nor has\n           \n\nappellant cited  us to any, that supports its contention that\n\na weak or ineffective  presentation in a prior  case deprives\n\nthe ruling of precedential effect.\").3  \n\n          There are two compelling reasons why these cases do\n\nnot  foreclose the  instant action.   First, the  question of\n\nwhether  a  mandatory retirement  age is  a  BFOQ is  a fact-\n\nintensive  inquiry.    See   Criswell,  472  U.S.  at  417-23\n                                     \n\n(discussing  the  fact-based  nature  of  the BFOQ  defense);\n\nJohnson v.

That it  did\n          neither was attributed to  its assessment\n          that  the  decision  would not  be  given\n          stare  decisis  effect  and   to  certain\n                        \n          practical  problems,  such  as  obtaining\n          expert witnesses.  \n\n     Trabucco II, 791 F.2d at 4.  \n                \n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nrequired  by  the  ADEA  of  an   employer  claiming  an  age\n\nqualification  is a BFOQ); EEOC v.

In the instant  case, plaintiffs\n  \n\npresented the district court  with evidence, not available to\n\nthe plaintiffs in Trabucco  I and II, suggesting that  age is\n                                    \n\nnot  an  effective  proxy  for  determining  an  individual's\n\nsuitability  to serve in a  public safety job.

And,  as  it  made  clear below,  the\n\ndistrict court  found this evidence persuasive.   See Gately,\n                                                            \n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\n811  F.  Supp. at  31  (\"Here .  .  . the  most  thorough and\n\nauthoritative  evidence  presented states  unequivocally that\n\ncurrently  available tests  are  more effective  than age  in\n\nidentifying  officers who  may be unable  to perform  the law\n\nenforcement and public safety tasks  required of them.\").  We\n\nsee no abuse of discretion in the district court's evaluation\n\nof this evidence.  \n\n          Second, not  only are the underlying  facts in this\n\ncase different from those  present in Trabucco I and  II, but\n                                                        \n\nthe legal landscape has been altered  in critical respects as\n\nwell.  In Trabucco I, which  was decided prior to the Supreme\n                    \n\nCourt's most recent pronouncements on the ADEA, see supra pp.\n                                                         \n\n6-7,  this court  applied a standard  more lenient  than that\n\nsubsequently adopted by the Supreme Court to determine--under\n\nthe  first prong  of the test--whether  age was  a BFOQ.   In\n\nTrabucco I, we held that an  employer must show that the  age\n          \n\nqualification is \"reasonably related\" to the operation of its\n\nbusiness.   Trabucco I, 738  F.2d at 37.   A year  later, the\n                      \n\nSupreme Court clarified that  \"[t]he BFOQ standard adopted in\n\nthe   statute  is   one   of   `reasonable  necessity,'   not\n\nreasonableness.\"   Criswell, 472 U.S. at 419.  See id. at 474\n                                                      \n\n(explaining   further  that  \"age  qualifications  [must]  be\n\nsomething  more than  `convenient' or  `reasonable'. .  . .).\n\nThe Court  also reiterated that  \"the BFOQ exception  `was in\n\nfact meant to be an extremely narrow exception to the general\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nprohibition' of age  discrimination contained  in the  ADEA.\"\n\nId. at 412 (quoting Dothard, 433 U.S. at 334).  Further, in a\n                           \n\ncase issued the same day as Criswell, the Court elaborated on\n                                    \n\nthe evidentiary standard  which must be  met in these  cases,\n\nstressing  that an  employer  must  make  a  \"particularized,\n\nfactual  showing\" that  age  is an  effective  proxy for  the\n\nqualification at issue.  Johnson, 472 U.S. at 362\n                                \n\n          In light of Criswell and Johnson, we agree with the\n                                          \n\ndistrict  court's  conclusion  that  Trabucco  I,  which  was\n                                                \n\ndecided   under  the   more  lenient   \"reasonable  relation\"\n\nstandard,   and  was   based  on   less  than   the  required\n\n\"particularized,  factual  showing,\"  has  been  called  into\n\nquestion.  See Gately, 811 F. Supp. at 30.\n                     \n\n          In sum,  therefore, this case involves  a different\n\nset of facts,  a newly crafted  set of legal  rules, and,  as\n\nsuch, legal issues  of first impression for this court.  As a\n\nresult, stare decisis does not provide a basis for avoiding a\n                     \n\ntrial on the merits.\n\n          2.  The 1986 Amendment to the ADEA\n                                            \n\n          Defendants next urge the application of 29 U.S.C.  \n\n623(j), a  1986 amendment  to the  ADEA which,  they contend,\n\nforecloses plaintiffs' claims.  We disagree.4 \n\n                    \n\n4.  Although  the   district  court   did  not  address   the\napplicability of this  amendment, it  is purely  a matter  of\nstatutory  interpretation, and  therefore a  question of  law\nwhich we  can review in the  first instance.

The term \"law enforcement officer\" is defined as:\n\n          [A]n  employee,  the   duties  of   whose\n          position are primarily the investigation,\n          apprehension, or detention of individuals\n          suspected   or   convicted  of   offenses\n          against the  criminal  laws of  a  State,\n          including  an  employee  engaged in  this\n          activity   who   is   transferred  to   a\n          supervisory or administrative position. .\n          . .\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\na retirement plan in effect on March 3, 1983.  It was on that\n\ndate that the Supreme  Court decided, in the seminal  case of\n\nEEOC  v.  Wyoming,  460  U.S. 226  (1983),  that  the  ADEA's\n                 \n\nprohibition  against mandatory  retirement was  applicable to\n\nstates and local governments.        \n\n          According to defendants,  this statute permits them\n\nto  apply Chapter 412 to plaintiffs because (a) Mass. Gen. L.\n\nch.  32,    26(3)(a), in  effect on  March 3,  1983, mandated\n                                \n\nretirement at age 50  for the members of the  former Division\n\nof  State Police; (b) although Chapter 32,   26(3)(a) was not\n\napplicable  to these specific plaintiffs on that date, it was\n\napplicable to  the members  of the  former Division  of State\n\nPolice; and (c) the duties formerly assigned the Division  of\n\nState  Police have  now been  assumed by  the members  of the\n\nConsolidated  Department.   In effect,  therefore, defendants\n\ncontend that   623(j) allows them to take a group of officers\n\nwho, in 1983, were subject to retirement at age 65, give them\n\na new title in 1992, and, in so doing, subtract 10 years from\n\ntheir retirement age.  \n\n          The plain meaning of  the statutory language simply\n\ndoes  not  support this  result.    Until its  expiration  on\n\nDecember  31, 1993,  the statute allows  states to  retire an\n\nindividual law  enforcement officer  on the  basis of  age if\n\n\"the individual has attained the  age of . . .  retirement in\n                                                             \n\neffect under applicable state or local law on March 3, 1983 .\n                       \n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\n. . .\"  29 U.S.C.   623(j)(1) (emphasis added).   On March 3,\n\n1983, the  statute applicable to plaintiffs  required them to\n                                           \n\nretire  at  age  65.    Therefore,  as  plaintiffs  have  not\n\n\"attained  the  age  of .  .  .  retirement  in effect  under\n\napplicable state or  local law  on March 3,  1983,\"    623(j)\n\ndoes not give defendants the refuge they seek.\n\n          To  be  sure, the  phraseology  is not  a  model of\n\nclarity.   Yet, in  their effort  to read  a loophole into   \n\n623(j),  defendants  ignore   the  word  \"individual,\"  which\n\nappears four times in the statute.  When read as  a whole, we\n\nbelieve  that the  language compels  the conclusion  that the\n\nword \"applicable\" means \"applicable to the individual.\"6\n\n          Even if we  were to construe  the statute as  being\n\nambiguous,  however,  we  do  not  believe  that  defendants'\n\ninterpretation is consistent with  the statute's purpose.  As\n\nexplained by  Senator Wendell  Ford of  Kentucky, one of  the\n\nprimary architects  of the  final compromise version  of this\n\nstatute,  Congress intended    623(j)  \"to provide  relief to\n\nthose jurisdictions which were forced to  respond to [EEOC v.\n                                                          \n\nWyoming],  while at  the same  time  ensuring that  no lesser\n       \n\ndiscrimination protection will be  provided for these workers\n                                                             \n\nthan what  was in effect  at the  time [EEOC v.  Wyoming] was\n                                                        \n\n                    \n\n6.  We want  to make clear,  however, that  we do not  read  \n623(j)(1) as allowing those officers who  may have elected to\ntransfer out of the MDC, Registry, or Capitol Police and into\nthe  Division of  State Police  to  claim the  retirement age\napplicable to them on March 3, 1983.  \n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\ndecided.\"  132  Cong. Rec. S16850-02  (daily ed. October  16,\n\n1986) (emphasis added).  \n\n          The statute, therefore, was enacted to give  states\n\na  grace  period of  seven  years during  which  time certain\n\nretirement  plans  for  law  enforcement  officers  would  be\n\nexempted from the ADEA's reach.  Senator Ford  explained that\n\nthe statute froze  pre-existing age caps  but did not  exempt\n\nfrom scrutiny stricter age caps subsequently enacted:\n\n          [T]his compromise establishes a floor for\n                                               \n          the  hiring  and retirement  requirements\n          which  a  State or  local  government can\n          set.    The  hiring  and  retirement  age\n          requirements  of a  plan in effect  as of\n          March   3,  1983  become  the  floor  for\n                                              \n          allowable plans.  . . .  If jurisdictions\n          have   raised  or   eliminated  mandatory\n          retirement  ages  after  this date,  they\n          have the choice of either moving back  to\n          the plan requirements in effect  on March\n          3,  1983,  or remaining  where  they are.\n          However,  States  and  local  governments\n          would not be able to lower retirement age\n                                    \n          requirements  below  what  was  [sic]  in\n          effect as of March 3, 1983.\n\nId. (emphasis added).  \n   \n\n          Thus,  in our  view,  neither the  language of  the\n\nstatute nor  its  legislative history  supports the  position\n\nadvanced by defendants.   This statute was enacted to provide\n\nan  exception, limited in  both purpose and  duration, to the\n\nADEA's   prohibition   on    mandatory   retirement.      The\n\nCommonwealth's   reliance  upon  this  limited  exception  to\n\ninsulate  from review its adoption of a new retirement policy\n\nwhich subtracts ten years from the retirement age statutorily\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\napplicable  to  plaintiffs on  March  3,  1983, is  therefore\n\nmisplaced.\n\n          In a last ditch attempt, however, to persuade us of\n\n  623(j)'s applicability, defendants alternatively argue that\n\nthe statute is ambiguous, and, as such, any ambiguity must be\n\nresolved in  the Commonwealth's favor.   In support  of their\n\nposition,  defendants cite  Gregory v.  Ashcroft, 111  S. Ct.\n                                                \n\n2395  (1991), in which the  Supreme Court held  that the ADEA\n\ndid  not preempt a  state constitutional  provision mandating\n\nthe  retirement of  state  judges at  age  70.   Id.  at 2408\n                                                    \n\n(construing the  \"policymaking\" exception  in   630(f)).   In\n\nthat case,  the Court  reasoned that  state judges  are among\n\nthose \"`officers who participate directly in the formulation,\n\nexecution,  or  review  of  broad public  policy  [and  thus]\n\nperform  functions that  go  to the  heart of  representative\n\ngovernment.'\"  Id.  at 2402 (quoting Sugarman v. Dougall, 413\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 634, 647 (1973)).  The power of the people of a state to\n\n\"determine  the   qualifications  of  their   most  important\n\ngovernment officials\" is, the  Court held, fundamental to our\n\nfederalist system.   Id.  Thus, courts should  not, according\n                        \n\nto  Gregory, construe  federal statutes  to infringe  on that\n           \n\npower  unless Congress expresses its  intent to do  so in the\n\nplainest  terms.   Id.  at 2401-03.   Finding  the text  of  \n                      \n\n630(f) ambiguous on the question of whether Congress intended\n\nto  exempt  state  judges,   the  Court  applied  the  \"plain\n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\nstatement\"  rule,  reasoning  that  \"[i]n the  face  of  such\n\nambiguity, we  will not  attribute to Congress  an intent  to\n\nintrude on  state governmental  functions .  . .  .\"   Id. at\n                                                          \n\n2406.\n\n          We have recently discussed the limited scope of the\n\nCourt's  holding in Gregory.  See  EEOC v. Massachusetts, 987\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 64, 67-70 (1st  Cir. 1993).   In that case, we  reversed\n\nthe  district  court's  decision,  based on  its  reading  of\n\nGregory,  that  the  ADEA did  not  preempt  a  state statute\n       \n\nrequiring annual  medical examinations for  its employees  at\n\nage  seventy.  We  reasoned that, although  the Gregory court\n                                                       \n\nwas \"unwavering  in its  desire to protect  state sovereignty\n\nand principles of federalism,\" it made \"unequivocally clear .\n\n. . the narrowness  of its holding.\"  EEOC  v. Massachusetts,\n                                                            \n\n987 F.2d at  68, 69 (\"At no point did  the Court suggest that\n\nall state  regulations of  public employees are  questions at\n\nthe heart of state sovereignty.\").  \n\n          We  likewise  reject   defendants'  argument   that\n\nGregory's \"plain  statement\" rule  bars plaintiffs' cause  of\n       \n\naction.   As discussed above,  we find no  ambiguities in the\n\ntext  of   623(j) which give us pause as to its applicability\n\nhere.    See Gregory,  111 S.  Ct.  at 2406  (explaining that\n                    \n\n\"plain statement\"  rule is \"a rule  of statutory construction\n\nto be  applied where statutory  intent is  ambiguous\").   See\n                                                             \n\nalso Hilton,  112  S.  Ct. at  566  (reiterating  the  same).\n           \n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n\nMoreover, unlike the statutory exemption at issue in Gregory,\n                                                            \n\n  623(j) makes  plain Congress' intent that the  ADEA protect\n\nlaw  enforcement officers  from  forced retirement  in  cases\n\nwhere the  retirement plan at issue is  more restrictive than\n\nthat in effect on March 3, 1983, or is a \"subterfuge to evade\n\nthe purposes\" of the ADEA.\n\n          In any event, we  think defendants give Gregory far\n                                                         \n\ntoo  broad a reading.  Plaintiffs, unlike the state judges at\n\nissue  in  Gregory,  are  not  \"constitutional officers\"  who\n                  \n\n\"participate  directly  in  the  formulation,  execution,  or\n\nreview of broad public  policy . . . .\"   Gregory, 111 S. Ct.\n                                                 \n\nat  2401-02.     Thus,  the  Court's   concern  with  federal\n\ninfringement  of a  core  function  going  to the  \"heart  of\n\nrepresentative government\"  is not  present here.   For these\n\nreasons, therefore, we decline to apply Gregory in the manner\n                                               \n\nurged by defendants. \n\n          Accordingly,  we find  no  abuse of  discretion  or\n\nmistake of  law in the district court's conclusion that there\n\nwas a likelihood that plaintiff would  succeed on the merits.\n\nWe turn now to the question of irreparable harm.\n\n     B.  The Potential for Irreparable Harm\n                                           \n\n          Defendants also contend  that plaintiffs failed  to\n\nmake the requisite showing of  irreparable harm, and that the\n\ndistrict court, therefore, abused its discretion in  granting\n\nplaintiffs'  motion  for injunctive  relief.    In so  doing,\n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\ndefendants rely principally upon  Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n61  (1974), which they  assert forecloses plaintiffs' claims.\n\nBecause this  court has not yet  had occasion to engage  in a\n\ndetailed  analysis  of Sampson,  and  this case  calls  for a\n                              \n\ncareful reading of the opinion, we begin with a discussion of\n\nthat case.\n\n          In  Sampson,   the  Supreme   Court  held   that  a\n                     \n\nprobationary  federal  employee,  who  sought to  enjoin  her\n\ndismissal from employment pending an administrative appeal to\n\nthe  Civil   Service  Commission  (\"CSC\"),  had   to  make  a\n\nparticularly strong  showing of  irreparable  harm to  obtain\n\npreliminary  relief.    Sampson,  415 U.S.  at  91-92.    The\n                               \n\ncritical facts are as  follows.  Upon her dismissal  from the\n\ndefendant  government   agency,   the  plaintiff   filed   an\n\nadministrative appeal with the CSC, alleging that the agency,\n\nin dismissing  her, had  failed to follow  applicable federal\n\nregulations.   Subsequently, she  filed an action  in federal\n\ndistrict court seeking reinstatement while her administrative\n\nappeal was pending.   In her complaint, she alleged  that the\n\ndismissal would deprive her of income and cause her to suffer\n\nthe embarrassment  of being  wrongfully discharged.   Finding\n\nthat plaintiff  might suffer irreparable harm  before the CSC\n\ncould  consider her  claim,  the district  court granted  the\n\ninjunction, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Id. at 66-67.\n                                                   \n\nThe  Supreme  Court   reversed,  concluding  that   the  harm\n\n                             -22-\n                              22\n\nplaintiff alleged she would suffer was  not irreparable.  Id.\n                                                             \n\nat 91-92.\n\n          The questions presented on appeal were twofold: (1)\n\nwhether  the  district  court  had  authority  to  issue  the\n\ninjunction,  and  (2)  if  so,  whether  the  injunction  was\n\nwarranted.   The Court stated  early in its  opinion that the\n\ntwo  questions were  analytically  related and  could not  be\n\nneatly \"bifurcated.\"  Id. at 68.   Accordingly, discussion of\n                         \n\nthe one makes little sense  in the absence of any mention  of\n\nthe other.\n\n          Although  the Court  ultimately answered  the first\n\nquestion  in the affirmative, it did so only after noting the\n\nmultiple  factors which  weighed against  a finding  that the\n\ndistrict  court  had authority  to  award  the injunction  at\n\nissue.   Those factors included:  (1) the fact that plaintiff\n\nwas   seeking   relief   prior   to   having  exhausted   her\n\nadministrative  remedies,  and  the  concomitant  \"disruptive\n\neffect which  the grant  of the temporary  relief .  . .  was\n\nlikely to have on the administrative process,\" id. at 83; (2)\n                                                  \n\nthe lack of  any express statutory basis for  the injunction;\n\n(3) the  absence of any  case law supporting  this particular\n\ninjunction;   (4)   \"the  well-established   rule   that  the\n\nGovernment has traditionally been granted the widest latitude\n\nin  the  dispatch of  its own  internal  affairs,\" id.  at 83\n                                                      \n\n(internal  quotations  omitted);   and  (5)  the   fact  that\n\n                             -23-\n                              23\n\nplaintiff  was  a  probationary  employee   entitled  to  few\n\nprocedural rights under the  relevant regulations, id. at 81-\n                                                      \n\n82.    Despite  these  considerations,  however,  the   Court\n\nconceded the  district court's limited authority  to issue an\n\ninjunction in this  type of  case, stating that  it was  \"not\n\nprepared to conclude that Congress in this class of cases has\n\nwholly  divested  the  district  courts  of  their  customary\n      \n\nauthority to grant temporary  injunctive relief . . . .\"  Id.\n                                                             \n\nat 80 (emphasis added).\n\n          Importantly,  the  Court  then admonished  district\n\njudges that, although the factors listed above did not render\n\nthem  \"wholly bereft  of the  authority\" to  grant injunctive\n\nrelief \"in this class of cases,\" they could not exercise that\n\nauthority \"without  regard to those  factors.\"  Id.   Indeed,\n                                                   \n\nthe Court declared that those factors \"are entitled  to great\n\nweight in  the equitable balancing process  which attends the\n\ngrant of injunctive relief.\"  Id.\n                                 \n\n          Before turning to  the dispositive second question,\n\ni.e.,  whether  injunctive  relief was  warranted,  the Court\n\nagain  reiterated the  close analytical  relationship between\n\nthe first and second questions:\n\n          Although we do not hold that Congress has\n          wholly   foreclosed   the   granting   of\n          preliminary  injunctive  relief  in  such\n          cases,  we do believe that [plaintiff] at\n          the  very least  must  make a  showing of\n          irreparable injury sufficient in kind and\n          degree to override these  factors cutting\n          against   the  general   availability  of\n\n                             -24-\n                              24\n\n          preliminary  injunctions  in   Government\n          personnel cases.\n\nId. at 84.\n   \n\n          In analyzing  the second question, the  Court first\n\nnoted the  complete absence in the record, with the exception\n\nof certain statements in plaintiff's unverified complaint, of\n\nany  evidence of irreparable harm.   Id. at 89-91.  The Court\n                                        \n\nof Appeals had held  that, at that stage of  the proceedings,\n\nthe  district court did not  need to find  that plaintiff was\n\nactually  irreparably   harmed,  and  that,  in   any  event,\n\nplaintiff's allegations afforded a  basis for such a finding.\n\nThe Court disagreed on both counts.\n\n          First,   the   Court   stated  unequivocally   that\n\nirreparable  harm is  a  critical element  of any  injunctive\n\nrelief in  federal  court.   Id. at  88.   Second, the  Court\n                                \n\nexplained that plaintiff's allegations  of temporary loss  of\n\nincome  and harm to reputation did not amount to a sufficient\n\nshowing  of   irreparable  harm.    Even   under  traditional\n\nstandards, according to the  Court, temporary loss of income,\n\nwhich  can be  recouped  at the  end of  a  trial, \"does  not\n\nusually constitute irreparable injury.\"  Id. at 90.7\n                                            \n\n                    \n\n7.  This  premise had  particular  force in  a Civil  Service\ncase, the Court  explained, because  of the Back  Pay Act,  5\nU.S.C.   5596(b)(1),  which provides a wrongfully  discharged\nCivil Service employee with full payment and benefits for the\ntime period  she was out of  work.  The Court  noted that the\nAct's   legislative   history   suggested    that   \"Congress\ncontemplated   that  it  would  be  the  usual,  if  not  the\nexclusive, remedy for wrongful discharge.\"  Id. at 90-91.\n                                               \n\n                             -25-\n                              25\n\n          As   for   plaintiff's  allegations   of   harm  to\n\nreputation,  the  Court  found  them unpersuasive.    It  was\n\ndifficult  to  imagine,  according  to  the  Court,  how  the\n\nagency's  failure to follow proper procedures in effectuating\n\nher  discharge could  cause harm  to  plaintiff's reputation,\n\nespecially   where  any   damage  could   be  undone   by  an\n\nadministrative determination in her favor.\n\n          The Court assumed, however, for the purposes of its\n\nopinion, that  plaintiff had  made a satisfactory  showing of\n\nfinancial and reputational hardship,  and then held that such\n\na showing \"falls far short  of the type of injury which  is a\n\nnecessary predicate to the issuance of a temporary injunction\n\nin  this  type of  case.\"    Id. at  91-92.    In a  footnote\n                                \n\nfollowing  this holding,  the  Court  provided the  following\n\ncaveat:\n\n          We  recognize that  cases  may  arise  in\n          which  the  circumstances surrounding  an\n          employee's  discharge, together  with the\n          resultant  effect on the employee, may so\n          far depart from the normal situation that\n          irreparable injury might be found.   Such\n          extraordinary  cases   are  difficult  to\n          define  in  advance of  their occurrence.\n          We have  held  that an  insufficiency  of\n          savings  or  difficulties in  immediately\n          obtaining    other   employment--external\n          factors   common   to   most   discharged\n          employees  and  not  attributable to  any\n          unusual actions relating to the discharge\n          itself--will  not  support  a finding  of\n          irreparable injury, however severely they\n          may affect a  particular individual.  But\n          we  do  not  wish  to  be  understood  as\n          foreclosing   relief  in   the  genuinely\n          extraordinary  situation.    Use  of  the\n\n                             -26-\n                              26\n\n          court's  injunctive power,  however, when\n          discharge of probationary employees is an\n          issue,  should  be   reserved  for   that\n          situation  rather  than  employed in  the\n          routine case.  \n\nId.  at 92 n.68 (citing Wettre v.

The Court reiterated throughout the\n       \n\nopinion that the district court  should not have weighed  the\n\nirreparable harm allegations without taking into  account the\n\nmultiple factors rendering tenuous its authority to reinstate\n\na discharged Civil Service employee pending the exhaustion of\n\nthe  administrative appeal process.  See supra p. 23.  Before\n                                              \n\nleaving the  question of the district  court's authority, the\n\nCourt explained  that the plaintiff  \"must make a  showing of\n\nirreparable injury sufficient in  kind and degree to override\n                                                             \n\nthese factors . . . .\"  Id. at 84 (emphasis added).

In  those  cases  in  which  we  have  applied  Sampson's\n                                                           \nheightened  standard,  we  have relied  upon  the plaintiff's\nfailure  to exhaust available  administrative remedies.   See\n                                                             \nChilcott,  747   F.2d  at  31-33  (plaintiff   airman  sought\n        \ninjunction  without  seeking  relief before  appropriate  Air\nForce  administrative boards);  Bailey,  722  F.2d at  943-45\n                                      \n(plaintiff  sought injunction  prior to exhausting  Title VII\nremedies);  Soldevila,  512 F.2d  at 429-30  (plaintiff civil\n                     \nservant  sought injunction  prior to  exhausting  CSC appeals\nprocess).     Thus,   the  precise   question  of   Sampson's\n                                                           \napplicability  where   a  plaintiff  has   no  administrative\nremedies  to  exhaust is  one  of  first  impression in  this\ncircuit. \n\n                             -29-\n                              29\n\nirreparable harm  was required to override  those factors was\n\nhardly surprising.\n\n          Needless to  say, those factors are  not present in\n\nall employee discharge cases.  And, it makes little sense, in\n\nour  opinion,  to  require  a district  court  to  weigh  all\n\ndischarged employees'  requests for  injunctive relief  as if\n\nthey  applied.   Nothing  in  Sampson  suggests that  result.\n                                     \n\nRather,  the  Court  repeatedly  referred to  the  fact-bound\n\nnature of its holding.   For instance, the Court  stated that\n\nthe  plaintiff's  showing \"falls  far  short of  the  type of\n\ninjury  which is a necessary  predicate to the  issuance of a\n\ntemporary  injunction in this type  of case.\"   Id. at 91-92.\n                                                   \n\nAnd, in the footnote  immediately following this holding, the\n\nCourt stated that \"[u]se of a court's injunctive power . . .,\n\nwhen discharge of probationary  employees is an issue, should\n\nbe reserved for [the genuinely extraordinary] situation . . .\n\n.\"9\n\n          The case before us  differs from Sampson in several\n                                                  \n\nsignificant respects:  (1) plaintiffs are not seeking interim\n\ninjunctive relief pending the completion of an administrative\n\n                    \n\n9.  As support for this holding,  the Court cited Wettre,  74\n                                                        \nF.

Wettre, 74\n                                                         \nF.

We  do  not  think,\n\ntherefore, that these plaintiffs  must meet the same exacting\n\nstandard required of the  plaintiff in Sampson, although they\n                                              \n\nclearly must establish irreparable harm, and point to factors\n\nsufficient  to  overcome  \"the traditional  unwillingness  of\n\ncourts of equity to enforce contracts for personal services.\"\n\nId. at 83.  \n   \n\n          The district  court held below that  plaintiffs had\n\nmade  a  sufficient, although  not  overwhelming,  showing of\n\nirreparable harm.   See Gately,  811 F. Supp. at  27-28.  The\n                              \n\nCourt rested its holding on two factual findings.  First, the\n\nCourt  found that  reinstatement  would not  be an  available\n\n                             -31-\n                              31\n\nremedy for those plaintiffs who, at the close of a successful\n\ntrial  on the merits,  would have reached  the new retirement\n\nage,  and, as a result of their earlier discharge, would lose\n\ntheir twilight years of employment.

Second, the\n                                        \n\nCourt was persuaded by plaintiffs' argument that, \"time spent\n\naway from the force [would] impair the plaintiffs' ability to\n\nstay in  touch with new developments,  especially during this\n\ntime of transition,  thus impairing  their effectiveness  and\n\nthat of the  State Police as a whole[,] if  and when they are\n\nultimately reinstated.\"10  Id. at 27.      \n                              \n\n          Like  the district  court, we view  the irreparable\n\nharm  question  as a  close call.    The sole  factor cutting\n\nagainst  the   district  court's  authority  to   issue  this\n\ninjunction  is the  wide latitude  traditionally granted  the\n\ngovernment  in dispatching  its  own internal  affairs.   See\n                                                             \n\nSampson, 415 U.S. at  83.  And, in accordance  with Sampson's\n                                                           \n\nteachings,  the   district  court  took   this  factor   into\n\nconsideration before granting the injunction.  Gately, 811 F.\n                                                     \n\nSupp.   at  28   (balancing  the   intrusion   into  internal\n\ngovernmental affairs  that would  result from  the injunction\n\nwith  the  harm  to plaintiffs  in  the  absence  of it,  and\n\nconcluding  that  any  harm  to  defendants  was  minimal  by\n\n                    \n\n10.  We  recognize  that  the  consolidation  process had  an\nanticipated completion date of  June 30, 1993.  On  the basis\nof  this  record, however,  we  have  no  way of  determining\nwhether the process has, in fact, been completed.   \n\n                             -32-\n                              32\n\ncomparison).    Ultimately, the  district court  balanced the\n\nequities  and  determined  that,  particularly  in  light  of\n\nplaintiffs' high probability of  succeeding on the merits, an\n\ninjunction was warranted.  \n\n          Mindful of the broad discretion afforded a district\n\ncourt  in weighing  irreparable harm,  see K-Mart  Corp., 875\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 915 (quoting  Wagner v.

Cir.  1987)),  we cannot  say that  the district  court\n\nerred in concluding that, under the circumstances, plaintiffs\n\nmade a  sufficient showing of irreparable harm.

For the reasons set forth below, we affirm. \n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                      Factual Background\n                                        \n\n          In  December  1991,  the Massachusetts  legislature\n\nenacted  1991 Mass.  Acts ch. 412  (effective July  1, 1992),\n\nwhich  called  for,  inter  alia, the  consolidation  of  the\n                                \n\nCommonwealth's largest police  force, the  Division of  State\n\nPolice,  with  its  three  smaller  forces, the  Metropolitan\n\nDistrict  Commission Police  (\"MDC\"),  the Registry  of Motor\n\nVehicles  Law  Enforcement  Division  (\"Registry\"),  and  the\n\nCapitol  Police.   The  newly  consolidated  police force  is\n\nreferred to as the \"Department of State Police.\"1 \n\n          Prior to  the consolidation,  officers of  the MDC,\n\nRegistry,  and Capitol  Police  were subject  to a  mandatory\n\nretirement age of 65,  and officers of the Division  of State\n\n                    \n\n1.  For purposes of clarity, however, throughout this opinion\nwe  refer  to  the new  Department  of  State  Police as  the\n\"Consolidated Department.\"\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nPolice  were  subject to  a mandatory  retirement age  of 50.\n\nSection   122  of  Chapter   412  repealed   those  mandatory\n\nretirement  ages  and  declared   that  all  members  of  the\n\nConsolidated  Department who reach their fifty-fifth birthday\n\non or before December 31, 1992, shall retire by that date.\n\n          On December 21, 1992, ten days before the effective\n\ndate of the new mandatory retirement age, plaintiffs, members\n\nof  the former  MDC and  Registry divisions,2  commenced this\n\naction seeking  injunctive relief on the grounds that the new\n\nmandatory  retirement age violated the ADEA.  See 29 U.S.C.  \n                                                 \n\n623(a)(1).  On December  30, 1992, after a hearing  that same\n\ndate, the district court issued an order granting plaintiffs'\n\nmotion  for preliminary  injunctive  relief.

Wyoming,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110881\"><a href=\"/opinion/110881/eeoc-v-wyoming/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983),  that  the  ADEA's\n                 \n\nprohibition  against mandatory  retirement was  applicable to\n\nstates and local governments.        \n\n          According to defendants,  this statute permits them\n\nto  apply Chapter 412 to plaintiffs because (a) Mass. Gen. L.\n\nch.  32,    26(3)(a), in  effect on  March 3,  1983, mandated\n                                \n\nretirement at age 50  for the members of the  former Division\n\nof  State Police; (b) although Chapter 32,   26(3)(a) was not\n\napplicable  to these specific plaintiffs on that date, it was\n\napplicable to  the members  of the  former Division  of State\n\nPolice; and (c) the duties formerly assigned the Division  of\n\nState  Police have  now been  assumed by  the members  of the\n\nConsolidated  Department.   In effect,  therefore, defendants\n\ncontend that   623(j) allows them to take a group of officers\n\nwho, in 1983, were subject to retirement at age 65, give them\n\na new title in 1992, and, in so doing, subtract 10 years from\n\ntheir retirement age.  \n\n          The plain meaning of  the statutory language simply\n\ndoes  not  support this  result.    Until its  expiration  on\n\nDecember  31, 1993,  the statute allows  states to  retire an\n\nindividual law  enforcement officer  on the  basis of  age if\n\n\"the individual has attained the  age of . . .  retirement in\n                                                             \n\neffect under applicable state or local law on March 3, 1983 .\n                       \n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\n. . .\"  29 U.S.C.   623(j)(1) (emphasis added).   On March 3,\n\n1983, the  statute applicable to plaintiffs  required them to\n                                           \n\nretire  at  age  65.    Therefore,  as  plaintiffs  have  not\n\n\"attained  the  age  of .  .  .  retirement  in effect  under\n\napplicable state or  local law  on March 3,  1983,\"    623(j)\n\ndoes not give defendants the refuge they seek.\n\n          To  be  sure, the  phraseology  is not  a  model of\n\nclarity.   Yet, in  their effort  to read  a loophole into   \n\n623(j),  defendants  ignore   the  word  \"individual,\"  which\n\nappears four times in the statute.  When read as  a whole, we\n\nbelieve  that the  language compels  the conclusion  that the\n\nword \"applicable\" means \"applicable to the individual.\"6\n\n          Even if we  were to construe  the statute as  being\n\nambiguous,  however,  we  do  not  believe  that  defendants'\n\ninterpretation is consistent with  the statute's purpose.  As\n\nexplained by  Senator Wendell  Ford of  Kentucky, one of  the\n\nprimary architects  of the  final compromise version  of this\n\nstatute,  Congress intended    623(j)  \"to provide  relief to\n\nthose jurisdictions which were forced to  respond to [EEOC v.\n                                                          \n\nWyoming],  while at  the same  time  ensuring that  no lesser\n       \n\ndiscrimination protection will be  provided for these workers\n                                                             \n\nthan what  was in effect  at the  time [EEOC v.  Wyoming] was\n                                                        \n\n                    \n\n6.  We want  to make clear,  however, that  we do not  read  \n623(j)(1) as allowing those officers who  may have elected to\ntransfer out of the MDC, Registry, or Capitol Police and into\nthe  Division of  State Police  to  claim the  retirement age\napplicable to them on March 3, 1983.  \n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\ndecided.\"  132  Cong. Rec. S16850-02  (daily ed. October  16,\n\n1986) (emphasis added).  \n\n          The statute, therefore, was enacted to give  states\n\na  grace  period of  seven  years during  which  time certain\n\nretirement  plans  for  law  enforcement  officers  would  be\n\nexempted from the ADEA's reach.  Senator Ford  explained that\n\nthe statute froze  pre-existing age caps  but did not  exempt\n\nfrom scrutiny stricter age caps subsequently enacted:\n\n          [T]his compromise establishes a floor for\n                                               \n          the  hiring  and retirement  requirements\n          which  a  State or  local  government can\n          set.    The  hiring  and  retirement  age\n          requirements  of a  plan in effect  as of\n          March   3,  1983  become  the  floor  for\n                                              \n          allowable plans.  . . .  If jurisdictions\n          have   raised  or   eliminated  mandatory\n          retirement  ages  after  this date,  they\n          have the choice of either moving back  to\n          the plan requirements in effect  on March\n          3,  1983,  or remaining  where  they are.\n          However,  States  and  local  governments\n          would not be able to lower retirement age\n                                    \n          requirements  below  what  was  [sic]  in\n          effect as of March 3, 1983.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110881\"><a href=\"/opinion/110881/eeoc-v-wyoming/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (emphasis added). </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> \n   \n\n          Thus,  in our  view,  neither the  language of  the\n\nstatute nor  its  legislative history  supports the  position\n\nadvanced by defendants.   This statute was enacted to provide\n\nan  exception, limited in  both purpose and  duration, to the\n\nADEA's   prohibition   on    mandatory   retirement.      The\n\nCommonwealth's   reliance  upon  this  limited  exception  to\n\ninsulate  from review its adoption of a new retirement policy\n\nwhich subtracts ten years from the retirement age statutorily\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\napplicable  to  plaintiffs on  March  3,  1983, is  therefore\n\nmisplaced.\n\n          In a last ditch attempt, however, to persuade us of\n\n  623(j)'s applicability, defendants alternatively argue that\n\nthe statute is ambiguous, and, as such, any ambiguity must be\n\nresolved in  the Commonwealth's favor.

Such\n          extraordinary  cases   are  difficult  to\n          define  in  advance of  their occurrence.\n          We have  held  that an  insufficiency  of\n          savings  or  difficulties in  immediately\n          obtaining    other   employment--external\n          factors   common   to   most   discharged\n          employees  and  not  attributable to  any\n          unusual actions relating to the discharge\n          itself--will  not  support  a finding  of\n          irreparable injury, however severely they\n          may affect a  particular individual.  But\n          we  do  not  wish  to  be  understood  as\n          foreclosing   relief  in   the  genuinely\n          extraordinary  situation.
