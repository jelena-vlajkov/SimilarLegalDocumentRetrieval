Motta v. District Director, INS, 869\r                                                                    \r\n\nF. Supp. 80, 98 (D. Mass. 1994).  Facing imminent deportation\r\n\nunder  8  U.S.C.    1182(a)(2)(A)(I)  (Supp.  V 1994),  Motta\r\n\npetitioned for  the  writ, alleging  that  his right  to  Due\r\n\nProcess under  the Fifth  Amendment had been  violated during\r\n\nthe course of his  earlier deportation proceedings.  Although\r\n\nthe district court did  not order his release, it  stayed his\r\n\ndeportation until  the Board  of Immigration Appeals  (\"BIA\")\r\n\ncould issue a  decision on Motta's  pending motion to  reopen\r\n\nhis deportation proceeding, and for ninety days thereafter to\r\n\npermit review  of that decision,  if necessary,  by the  U.S.\r\n\nCourt  of  Appeals for  the  First  Circuit.   Id.   The  INS\r                                                              \r\n\nappealed.  The BIA has not yet issued a decision.\r\n\n          During  oral argument,  we raised with  counsel the\r\n\npossibility that a settlement might be  in the best interests\r\n\nof both parties.  Counsel for the INS  indicated that the INS\r\n\nmight  be  willing to  extend to  Motta  a temporary  stay of\r\n\ndeportation comparable to that  ordered by the district court\r\n\nif the lower court decision    establishing what the INS sees\r\n\nas  a  dangerous and  erroneous  precedent     were  vacated.\r\n\nCounsel for Motta  indicated that this  might be a  desirable\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nresolution  for his client as well, since it removes any risk\r\n\nthat  this Court  would agree  with the  INS and  reverse the\r\n\ndistrict  court's  stay  of  deportation.    At  the  end  of\r\n\nargument,   we  directed   counsel  to  discuss   a  possible\r\n\nsettlement with their clients and to advise this Court within\r\n\n10  days as to whether  such an agreement  would be possible.\r\n\nThe  INS subsequently informed this  Court that the INS would\r\n\nstay Motta's deportation during the pendency of his appeal to\r\n\nthe BIA and for  an additional ten days thereafter  to afford\r\n\ntime  to file  a  petition for  review  before the  Court  of\r\n\nAppeals, if necessary.  Motta's counsel has indicated that he\r\n\naccepts the tendered INS stay.\r\n\n          There now  being no actual controversy  between the\r\n\ntwo parties, we hold that this  appeal is moot and vacate the\r\n\nlower court's decision.   United States v. Munsingwear, Inc.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n340 U.S. 36,  39-40 (1951).   In vacating  the lower  court's\r\n\ndecision, we have taken pains to consider whether this appeal\r\n\nfalls  within the Supreme Court's prohibition against vacatur\r\n\nin U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v.  Bonner Mall Partnership, 115\r                                                                    \r\n\nS. Ct.  386  (1994).   We  conclude that  it  does not.    In\r\n\nBancorp, the  Court held that \"[w]here  mootness results from\r                   \r\n\nsettlement . . . , the losing party has voluntarily forfeited\r\n\nhis  legal remedy  by  the ordinary  processes  of appeal  or\r\n\ncertiorari, thereby  surrendering his claim  to the equitable\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nremedy of vacatur.   The  judgment is  not unreviewable,  but\r\n\nsimply unreviewed by his own choice.\"  Id. at 392.  \r                                                      \r\n\n          Here, given the different posture of this case, the\r\n\nequities plainly  favor vacatur.  The INS  did not by its own\r\n\ninitiative relinquish its right to vacatur, as the petitioner\r\n\ndid in Bancorp.   Rather, the INS has at  all times sought to\r                          \r\n\npursue its appeal;  it has agreed to consider settlement only\r\n\nat  the suggestion  of  this Court,  the proposed  settlement\r\n\nbeing an  inexpensive, simple, and speedy  way to accommodate\r\n\nthe  interests of both parties.  As the INS has not initiated\r\n\nthe relinquishment  of  its right  to  the remedy,  the  same\r\n\nequitable calculus  underlying Bancorp is not  present.  Nor,\r                                                  \r\n\ngiven  this   Court's  involvement  and  initiative   in  the\r\n\nproceedings, does vacatur in this case implicate the concerns\r\n\nexpressed  by the  Bancorp Court  about giving  parties undue\r                                      \r\n\ncontrol over judicial precedents.  We see no appreciable harm\r\n\nto the orderly functioning of the federal  judicial system by\r\n\nvacating judgment.\r\n\n          To be sure,  it can  be argued  that depriving  the\r\n\npublic and the  judicial system of the precedential  value of\r\n\nthe district court's opinion works a kind of harm.  But we do\r\n\nnot believe that  such a species of harm is  entitled to take\r\n\npriority  over  the parties'  best  interests.   Placing  the\r\n\nformer  above the  latter  would be  inequitable.   This case\r\n\ncontrasts with the  usual appeal, where  vacatur is only  one\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nconsideration among others in  a settlement.  Here,  the INS,\r\n\nas  a repeat player before the courts, is primarily concerned\r                                                               \r\n\nwith  the precedential effect of the decision below.  If that\r\n\ndecision   stands,  all   possibility  of  a   settlement  is\r\n\neliminated.   If  it is  vacated, the  appellee acquires  the\r\n\nabsolute  certainty   of  not   being  deported,   while  the\r\n\ngovernment  saves the costs and  risk of litigation     a win\r\n\nfor  both sides.  It is true  the Bancorp Court discusses and\r                                                     \r\n\nrejects  the  possible impact  of  its  rule in  discouraging\r\n\nsettlements.   Id. at  393.   But  it does  so in  aggregate,\r                              \r\n\nsaying  in the  end that  \"[w]e find  it quite  impossible to\r\n\nassess  the  effect of  our  holding,  either way,  upon  the\r\n\nfrequency or systemic value of settlement.\"  In this case, by\r\n\ncontrast,  the negative  impact on  settlement is  absolutely\r\n\nclear.      We   think   this  case   presents   \"exceptional\r\n\ncircumstances\" to which the Court referred in Bancorp.  \r                                                                 \r\n\n          We accordingly vacate the district court's decision\r\n\nand remand with directions to dismiss this suit as moot.   We\r\n\nalso deny, as  moot, the  INS's pending motion  for leave  to\r\n\nfile  a supplemental  brief.   Each party  will bear  its own\r\n\ncosts.\r\n\n          So ordered.  \r                                \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n",

At  the  end  of\r\n\nargument,   we  directed   counsel  to  discuss   a  possible\r\n\nsettlement with their clients and to advise this Court within\r\n\n10  days as to whether  such an agreement  would be possible.\r\n\nThe  INS subsequently informed this  Court that the INS would\r\n\nstay Motta's deportation during the pendency of his appeal to\r\n\nthe BIA and for  an additional ten days thereafter  to afford\r\n\ntime  to file  a  petition for  review  before the  Court  of\r\n\nAppeals, if necessary.  Motta's counsel has indicated that he\r\n\naccepts the tendered INS stay.\r\n\n          There now  being no actual controversy  between the\r\n\ntwo parties, we hold that this  appeal is moot and vacate the\r\n\nlower court's decision.   United States v. Munsingwear, Inc.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  39-40 (1951).   In vacating  the lower  court's\r\n\ndecision, we have taken pains to consider whether this appeal\r\n\nfalls  within the Supreme Court's prohibition against vacatur\r\n\nin U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v.  Bonner Mall Partnership, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117879\"><a href=\"/opinion/117879/us-bancorp-mortgage-co-v-bonner-mall-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span>\r                                                                    \r\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span>  <span class=\"page\">386</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1994).   We  conclude that  it  does not.    In\r\n\nBancorp, the  Court held that \"[w]here  mootness results from\r                   \r\n\nsettlement . . . , the losing party has voluntarily forfeited\r\n\nhis  legal remedy  by  the ordinary  processes  of appeal  or\r\n\ncertiorari, thereby  surrendering his claim  to the equitable\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nremedy of vacatur.   The  judgment is  not unreviewable,  but\r\n\nsimply unreviewed by his own choice.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117879\"><a href=\"/opinion/117879/us-bancorp-mortgage-co-v-bonner-mall-partnership/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 392. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> \r                                                      \r\n\n          Here, given the different posture of this case, the\r\n\nequities plainly  favor vacatur.  The INS  did not by its own\r\n\ninitiative relinquish its right to vacatur, as the petitioner\r\n\ndid in Bancorp.   Rather, the INS has at  all times sought to\r                          \r\n\npursue its appeal;  it has agreed to consider settlement only\r\n\nat  the suggestion  of  this Court,  the proposed  settlement\r\n\nbeing an  inexpensive, simple, and speedy  way to accommodate\r\n\nthe  interests of both parties.  As the INS has not initiated\r\n\nthe relinquishment  of  its right  to  the remedy,  the  same\r\n\nequitable calculus  underlying Bancorp is not  present.  Nor,\r                                                  \r\n\ngiven  this   Court's  involvement  and  initiative   in  the\r\n\nproceedings, does vacatur in this case implicate the concerns\r\n\nexpressed  by the  Bancorp Court  about giving  parties undue\r                                      \r\n\ncontrol over judicial precedents.  We see no appreciable harm\r\n\nto the orderly functioning of the federal  judicial system by\r\n\nvacating judgment.\r\n\n          To be sure,  it can  be argued  that depriving  the\r\n\npublic and the  judicial system of the precedential  value of\r\n\nthe district court's opinion works a kind of harm.  But we do\r\n\nnot believe that  such a species of harm is  entitled to take\r\n\npriority  over  the parties'  best  interests.   Placing  the\r\n\nformer  above the  latter  would be  inequitable.   This case\r\n\ncontrasts with the  usual appeal, where  vacatur is only  one\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nconsideration among others in  a settlement.  Here,  the INS,\r\n\nas  a repeat player before the courts, is primarily concerned\r                                                               \r\n\nwith  the precedential effect of the decision below.  If that\r\n\ndecision   stands,  all   possibility  of  a   settlement  is\r\n\neliminated.   If  it is  vacated, the  appellee acquires  the\r\n\nabsolute  certainty   of  not   being  deported,   while  the\r\n\ngovernment  saves the costs and  risk of litigation     a win\r\n\nfor  both sides.  It is true  the Bancorp Court discusses and\r                                                     \r\n\nrejects  the  possible impact  of  its  rule in  discouraging\r\n\nsettlements.   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117879\"><a href=\"/opinion/117879/us-bancorp-mortgage-co-v-bonner-mall-partnership/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at  393. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  But  it does  so in  aggregate,\r                              \r\n\nsaying  in the  end that  \"[w]e find  it quite  impossible to\r\n\nassess  the  effect of  our  holding,  either way,  upon  the\r\n\nfrequency or systemic value of settlement.\"  In this case, by\r\n\ncontrast,  the negative  impact on  settlement is  absolutely\r\n\nclear.      We   think   this  case   presents   \"exceptional\r\n\ncircumstances\" to which the Court referred in Bancorp.  \r                                                                 \r\n\n          We accordingly vacate the district court's decision\r\n\nand remand with directions to dismiss this suit as moot.   We\r\n\nalso deny, as  moot, the  INS's pending motion  for leave  to\r\n\nfile  a supplemental  brief.   Each party  will bear  its own\r\n\ncosts.\r\n\n          So ordered.  \r                                \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n</pre>",
