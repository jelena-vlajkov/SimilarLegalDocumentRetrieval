Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Cyr, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                       Circuit Judges.\r                                                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\nRoger A. Cox on brief for appellant.\r                        \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per  Curiam.    Douglas  Abrahams  pled  guilty  to\r                                 \r\n\nconspiring to  possess cocaine with intent  to distribute and\r\n\nto distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.   846 and was\r\n\nsentenced  to  serve  92 months  in  a  federal  prison.   He\r\n\nappealed  from  his sentence.    After  this court  appointed\r\n\nAttorney Roger  Cox as appellate  counsel, Cox filed  a brief\r\n\nunder  Anders  v. California,  386  U.S. 738  (1967),  on the\r                                        \r\n\nground  that he had  been unable to  identify any meritorious\r\n\nground  for appeal.   Cox also filed a  motion to withdraw as\r\n\nAbrahams' counsel, notifying Abrahams of his  right to file a\r\n\nseparate  brief.   Abrahams has  not filed  a brief,  and the\r\n\ndeadline for doing so has now passed. \r\n\n          We agree  that this appeal presents  no meritorious\r\n\nissues,  and so we affirm the sentence.  The record indicates\r\n\nthat  Abrahams did  not  believe that  he should  receive the\r\n\nenhanced  base offense level  accorded career offenders under\r\n\nthe United States Sentencing  Guidelines Manual   4B1.1 (Nov.\r\n\n1993).  Relying on Abrahams' previous convictions for robbery\r\n\nin  Maine and for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon\r\n\nin Massachusetts,  the probation officer found  that Abrahams\r\n\nwas  a career offender within  the meaning of    4B1.1 and so\r\n\nenhanced Abrahams' base offense level  under that guideline.1\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  convictions  were a  June  25,  1984 conviction  for\r\nrobbery in Cumberland  County, Maine, and  an April 15,  1988\r\nconviction for  assault and battery  by means of  a dangerous\r\nweapon in Newburyport, Massachusetts.  \r\r\n\nIn  a  letter to  the  probation  officer, Abrahams'  counsel\r\n\nobjected  to  the  use  of  those  convictions  to  establish\r\n\nAbraham's  career offender  status.   According  to  counsel,\r\n\nMassachusetts had  reneged  on  a  plea  agreement  promising\r\n\nAbrahams a concurrent sentence on the Massachusetts charge if\r\n\nhe  pled guilty to both the  Maine and Massachusetts charges.\r\n\nCounsel also stated that  no mittimus had ever been  filed in\r\n\nthe Massachusetts conviction.  \r\n\n          At  sentencing,  counsel  reasserted his  objection\r\n\nbased  on  Massachusetts'  alleged  violation  of  its   plea\r\n\nagreement with Abrahams, although his objection may have been\r\n\nlimited to  the Maine  conviction.   Citing Custis  v. United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates, 114  S. Ct. 1732, 1735-36, 1738-39  (1994), the court\r                  \r\n\noverruled the objection because Abrahams had been represented\r\n\nby  counsel in  those  convictions.   In Custis,  the Supreme\r                                                           \r\n\nCourt  held that the Armed  Career Criminal Act,  18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n924(e),  did  not  specifically  permit  any  such collateral\r\n\nattack, and it  declined to  imply any such  right under  the\r\n\nstatute.    Id.  at  1735-36.    The  Court  also  held  that\r                           \r\n\ndefendants could  attack a prior state  court conviction used\r\n\nfor sentence enhancement under  the Constitution only if they\r\n\nhad not been represented by counsel at all in connection with\r\n\nthe prior conviction.  Id. at 1738.\r                                      \r\n\n          The  district  court  correctly found  that  Custis\r                                                                         \r\n\nforeclosed  any constitutionally  based collateral  attack on\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nAbrahams'   prior  state   convictions  at   his  sentencing.\r\n\nAccording  to  the  presentence  report,  Abrahams  had  been\r\n\nrepresented by  counsel in  both the Maine  and Massachusetts\r\n\nconvictions.     His  counsel  affirmed  that   fact  at  the\r\n\nsentencing hearing.  In  addition, the Sentencing  Guidelines\r\n\ndo not independently permit  collateral attack on prior state\r\n\nconvictions used  to establish  career offender  status under\r\n\nguideline    4B1.1.   Guideline    4A1.2 applies  in counting\r\n\nconvictions under   4B1.1.  See USSG   4B1.2, comment. (n.4).\r                                           \r\n\nApplication  note  6  of  that guideline  states  that  \"this\r\n\nguideline and commentary do not confer upon the defendant any\r\n\nright  to   attack  collaterally  [in  a  current  sentencing\r\n\nproceeding] a  prior conviction  or sentence beyond  any such\r\n\nrights  otherwise  recognized  in  law[.]\"    At  sentencing,\r\n\ncounsel did  not  assert  that  any other  statute,  rule  or\r\n\nregulation  independent of the  Guidelines gave  Abrahams any\r\n\nsuch right, and, as noted, the Constitution conferred no such\r\n\nright on Abrahams here.  See United States v. Munoz, 36  F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n1229,  1337 (1st  Cir.  1994)  (the  constitutional  question\r\n\nresolved  in   Custis  is  the  same   under  the  sentencing\r                                 \r\n\nguidelines  as under  the Armed  Career Criminal  Act), cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied, 115 S. Ct. 1164 (1995).  \r                  \r\n\n          Accordingly, the court did not err in accepting the\r\n\nprobation officer's determination that Abrahams was a  career\r\n\noffender within the meaning of   4B1.1.  See United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nGarcia, 42 F.3d 573,  578-81 (10th Cir. 1994);  United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

Sec. 924(e), did not specifically permit any such collateral attack, and it declined to imply any such right under the statute.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087955\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087955/custis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1735-36. </a></span> The Court also held that defendants could attack a prior state court conviction used for sentence enhancement under the Constitution only if they had not been represented by counsel at all in connection with the prior conviction.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087955\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087955/custis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1738.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly found that Custis foreclosed any constitutionally based collateral attack on Abrahams' prior state convictions at his sentencing.  According to the presentence report, Abrahams had been represented by counsel in both the Maine and Massachusetts convictions.  His counsel affirmed that fact at the sentencing hearing.  In addition, the Sentencing Guidelines do not independently permit collateral attack on prior state convictions used to establish career offender status under guideline Sec. 4B1.1.  Guideline Sec. 4A1.2 applies in counting convictions under Sec. 4B1.1.  See USSG Sec. 4B1.2, comment.  (n.4).  Application note 6 of that guideline states that \"this guideline and commentary do not confer upon the defendant any right to attack collaterally [in a current sentencing proceeding] a prior conviction or sentence beyond any such rights otherwise recognized in law[.]\"  At sentencing, counsel did not assert that any other statute, rule or regulation independent of the Guidelines gave Abrahams any such right, and, as noted, the Constitution conferred no such right on Abrahams here.

Munoz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195659\"><a href=\"/opinion/195659/united-states-v-delgado-munoz/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1229</span></a></span>, 1337 (1st Cir. 1994) (the constitutional question resolved in Custis is the same under the sentencing guidelines as under the Armed Career Criminal Act), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
