Appellant  Edward  K.  Wojnar  sued\r                                 \n\nappellee   Dr.  Martin   Bauermeister  for   injuries  Wojnar\n\nallegedly  sustained during the time he was held at the Rhode\n\nIsland Adult  Correctional Institutions.  After  a trial, the\n\njury  found for Dr. Bauermeister.  Wojnar appeals a ruling by\n\nthe trial court (Torres, J.) which granted Dr. Bauermeister's\n\nmotion  in limine to exclude evidence relating to a claim for\n\nmedical negligence or medical malpractice.   Dr. Bauermeister\n\nhad  asserted,  and  the  district court  agreed,  that  such\n\nevidence  was inadmissable because Wojnar's amended complaint\n\ndid  not state  a claim  for negligence.   Rather,  the court\n\nfound, the complaint charged Dr. Bauermeister with deliberate\n\nindifference to  Wojnar's medical  needs in violation  of the\n\nEighth Amendment  to the United States  Constitution.  Wojnar\n\nmakes three arguments on appeal.\n\n          1.    Wojnar  argues  that  Judge   Torres'  ruling\n\ndirectly contradicted an earlier order by a magistrate judge.\n\nThis order  denied Wojnar's motion  to file a  second amended\n\ncomplaint.1  According to  Wojnar, the magistrate judge ruled\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  The  second amended  complaint set  forth allegations  of\nnegligence.   However, the denial  of the motion  to amend is\nnot  before us, Wojnar having failed to object within the 10-\nday time period  set forth in 28 U.S.C.    636(b)(1)(A).  See\r                                                                         \nUnited States v.  Akinola, 985 F.2d  1105, 1108-09 (1st  Cir.\r                                     \n1993)  (where a party does not object to a magistrate judge's\norder, the  court of  appeals has no  jurisdiction to  review\nit).\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nthat a  second amended complaint was  unnecessary because the\n\namended complaint already stated a claim for negligence.\n\n          Judge Torres, however, determined that although the\n\nmagistrate judge's order  was ambiguous, the  more reasonable\n\ninterpretation was  that the magistrate judge  had denied the\n\nmotion  to amend  because  Dr. Bauermeister  would have  been\n\nprejudiced.    Such  a   finding  made  sense,  Judge  Torres\n\nconcluded, only if the magistrate  judge had read the  second\n\namended complaint as setting forth a new theory for relief.\r                                                    \n\n          We agree.   Wojnar ignores  the magistrate  judge's\n\nemphasis on the fact that Wojnar waited to file the motion to\n\namend until  the close  of discovery.   The  magistrate judge\n\nrelied on this  \"undue delay\" to  find that Dr.  Bauermeister\n\nwould have  been prejudiced  if Wojnar  were allowed  to file\n\namended  pleadings   with  \"more  substantial   or  different\n\nclaims.\"   Given  the  equivocal language  in the  magistrate\n\njudge's order, we cannot say that Judge Torres' reading of it\n\nwas  an abuse  of discretion.   See  Independent Oil  &amp; Chem.\r                                                                         \n\nWorkers v. Procter &amp;  Gamble Mfg. Co., 864 F.2d 927, 929 (1st\r                                                 \n\nCir.  1988) (abuse  of  discretion occurs  when the  district\n\ncourt  \"makes a  serious mistake\"  in evaluating  the factors\n\nrelative to a decision).\n\n          Wojnar further argues that Judge Torres ignored the\n\nmagistrate judge's  recommendation, made in  the same  order,\n\nthat Dr.  Bauermeister's Rule 12(b)(6) motion  to dismiss the\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\namended  complaint   be  denied.    Wojnar   avers  that  the\n\nmagistrate  judge  based this  suggestion  on  the view  that\n\nWojnar's   supplemental   answers   to   Dr.   Bauermeister's\n\ninterrogatories  put the  latter on  notice that  the amended\n\ncomplaint stated a claim for malpractice.\n\n          Wojnar misconstrues  this ruling.  It  appears that\n\nthe magistrate  judge was addressing a  different motion, one\n\nbased  on  the  allegation  that Wojnar  had  failed  to file\n\nsufficiently   detailed   answers   to   Dr.   Bauermeister's\n\ninterrogatories.   Dr. Bauermeister filed  this motion  under\n\nFed.  R.  Civ.  P.  37(b)(2)(C),  not  Rule  12(b)(6).    The\n\nmagistrate  judge  determined   that  Wojnar's   supplemental\n\nanswers  (filed   after  the  Rule  37   motion)  \"provide[d]\n\nsubstantially more detail\" than the original answers and that\n\na dismissal under Rule 37 was  not warranted.  He did not, as\n\nWojnar avers, make any  finding concerning the sufficiency of\r                                  \n\nthese answers as they related to a claim for negligence.\n\n          Wojnar makes  a similar  argument in regard  to the\n\norder's denial of Dr.  Bauermeister's motion for a protective\n\norder.   Dr. Bauermeister had requested that the date for his\n\nresponses  to  Wojnar's  interrogatories be  postponed  until\n\nafter Wojnar  filed a complaint adequately  setting forth the\n\nnature of Wojnar's claims against  him.  The magistrate judge\n\nstated  that in recommending the denial  of the Rule 12(b)(6)\n\nmotion  to dismiss, \"I have in essence stated my opinion that\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nthe  amended complaint  adequately gives  fair notice  of the\n\nclaim  against defendant.\"   Again, there is  nothing in this\n\nlanguage to suggest that  the magistrate judge was addressing\n\nthe question  whether the amended complaint  gave fair notice\n\nto Dr. Bauermeister of the medical malpractice claim.\r                                                          \n\n          In  any event, we agree with  Judge Torres that the\n\namended  complaint   did  not   include  a  tort   claim  for\n\nmalpractice.   As he pointed out, the first paragraph of this\n\ncomplaint states  that damages were being  sought pursuant to\n\n42  U.S.C.    1983  for, among  other  acts, the  \"denial  of\n\nadequate  medical care.\"   That Wojnar intended  to base this\n\nclaim on the United  States Constitution is further evidenced\n\nby  his  reference  to  the  Eighth  Amendment  in  the  same\n\nsentence.  Even  more probative, we think,  is the concluding\n\nsentence of this  paragraph.   In it, Wojnar  states that  he\n\n\"also  seeks . . . damages for  the common law torts of false\n\narrest, unlawful imprisonment [and] assault and battery . . .\n\nunder  pendent jurisdiction.\"  Significantly absent from this\n\nlist is a claim for the tort of malpractice.\n\n          2.    Wojnar next  points  to  a  statement by  the\n\nmagistrate judge at voir dire.  In describing the case to the\n\npotential jurors, the  magistrate judge  (who impanelled  the\n\njury)  stated  that  it  was a  \"medical  malpractice  case.\"\n\nWojnar argues  that this statement  indicates the  magistrate\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\njudge's unswerving belief that the amended complaint stated a\n\nclaim for negligence.\n\n          However, counsel for Dr. Bauermeister objected when\n\nthe  magistrate judge  made  this observation.   After  being\n\ninformed  by  counsel of  his intent  to  file the  motion in\n\nlimine, the magistrate judge clarified that the case involved\n\n\"medical malpractice and/or complete indifference.\"  At most,\n\nthis  shows  that  the  magistrate judge  believed  that  the\n\namended complaint was ambiguous.\n\n          3.   Finally, Wojnar asserts  that Dr. Bauermeister\n\nwas  on notice  as early  as March  4, 1994  that Wojnar  was\n\nclaiming medical malpractice.  As evidence for this argument,\n\nWojnar  points   to  an   interrogatory  propounded   by  Dr.\n\nBauermeister on  this date.   In  it, Dr.  Bauermeister asked\n\nthat  Wojnar specify  the \"negligent\"  acts committed  by Dr.\n\nBauermeister  or  his agents.    Wojnar also  avers  that Dr.\n\nBauermeister admitted, in the motion  in limine, that he  had\n\nbecome  apprised of the negligence claim on July 25 (the date\n\nWojnar filed his supplemental  answers to Dr.  Bauermeister's\n\ninterrogatories  and 10 days after Wojnar filed the motion to\r                                              \n\namend).\n\n          We reject these arguments.  As Judge Torres stated,\n\nthe fact  that  one party  propounds interrogatories  \"fairly\n\nwithin  the  ambit  of  the  complaint\"  cannot  add  to  the\n\ncomplaint claims not otherwise asserted in it.  We agree with\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nJudge Torres' observation that to so  hold would constitute a\n\ntrap for the thorough.   Further, a party can hardly  be said\n\nto  acquiesce  in the  assertion of  new  claims by  filing a\n\nmotion in opposition to them.  This view would render useless\n\nmotions such  as the  one filed here,  as well as  motions to\n\ndismiss,  and would provide no recourse  to parties harmed by\n\nthe tardy assertion of new claims or defenses.\n\n          For the reasons stated  above, Judge Torres did not\n\nabuse his discretion in granting Dr. Bauermeister's motion in\n\nlimine.  See Knowlton v. Deseret Medical, Inc., 930 F.2d 116,\r                                                          \n\n124 (1st  Cir.  1991) (standard  of  review for  decision  to\n\nexclude evidence is abuse of discretion).\n\n          We therefore  affirm the  judgment of  the district\r                                          \n\ncourt.

Wojnar sued appellee Dr. Martin Bauermeister for injuries Wojnar allegedly sustained during the time he was held at the Rhode Island Adult Correctional Institutions.  After a trial, the jury found for Dr. Bauermeister.  Wojnar appeals a ruling by the trial court (Torres, J.) which granted Dr. Bauermeister's motion in limine to exclude evidence relating to a claim for medical negligence or medical malpractice.  Dr. Bauermeister had asserted, and the district court agreed, that such evidence was inadmissable because Wojnar's amended complaint did not state a claim for negligence.  Rather, the court found, the complaint charged Dr. Bauermeister with deliberate indifference to Wojnar's medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Wojnar makes three arguments on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Wojnar argues that Judge Torres' ruling directly contradicted an earlier order by a magistrate judge.  This order denied Wojnar's motion to file a second amended complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  According to Wojnar, the magistrate judge ruled that a second amended complaint was unnecessary because the amended complaint already stated a claim for negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Torres, however, determined that although the magistrate judge's order was ambiguous, the more reasonable interpretation was that the magistrate judge had denied the motion to amend because Dr. Bauermeister would have been prejudiced.  Such a finding made sense, Judge Torres concluded, only if the magistrate judge had read the second amended complaint as setting forth a new theory for relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree.  Wojnar ignores the magistrate judge's emphasis on the fact that Wojnar waited to file the motion to amend until the close of discovery.  The magistrate judge relied on this \"undue delay\" to find that Dr. Bauermeister would have been prejudiced if Wojnar were allowed to file amended pleadings with \"more substantial or different claims.\"  Given the equivocal language in the magistrate judge's order, we cannot say that Judge Torres' reading of it was an abuse of discretion.  See Independent Oil &amp; Chem.  Workers v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516410\"><a href=\"/opinion/516410/the-independent-oil-and-chemical-workers-of-quincy-inc-v-the-procter/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></a></span>, 929 (1st Cir. 1988) (abuse of discretion occurs when the district court \"makes a serious mistake\" in evaluating the factors relative to a decision).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wojnar further argues that Judge Torres ignored the magistrate judge's recommendation, made in the same order, that Dr. Bauermeister's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the amended complaint be denied.  Wojnar avers that the magistrate judge based this suggestion on the view that Wojnar's supplemental answers to Dr. Bauermeister's interrogatories put the latter on notice that the amended complaint stated a claim for malpractice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wojnar misconstrues this ruling.  It appears that the magistrate judge was addressing a different motion, one based on the allegation that Wojnar had failed to file sufficiently detailed answers to Dr. Bauermeister's interrogatories.  Dr. Bauermeister filed this motion under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(C), not Rule 12(b)(6).  The magistrate judge determined that Wojnar's supplemental answers (filed after the Rule 37 motion) \"provide[d] substantially more detail\" than the original answers and that a dismissal under Rule 37 was not warranted.  He did not, as Wojnar avers, make any finding concerning the sufficiency of these answers as they related to a claim for negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wojnar makes a similar argument in regard to the order's denial of Dr. Bauermeister's motion for a protective order.  Dr. Bauermeister had requested that the date for his responses to Wojnar's interrogatories be postponed until after Wojnar filed a complaint adequately setting forth the nature of Wojnar's claims against him.  The magistrate judge stated that in recommending the denial of the Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, \"I have in essence stated my opinion that the amended complaint adequately gives fair notice of the claim against defendant.\"  Again, there is nothing in this language to suggest that the magistrate judge was addressing the question whether the amended complaint gave fair notice to Dr. Bauermeister of the medical malpractice claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, we agree with Judge Torres that the amended complaint did not include a tort claim for malpractice.  As he pointed out, the first paragraph of this complaint states that damages were being sought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 for, among other acts, the \"denial of adequate medical care.\"  That Wojnar intended to base this claim on the United States Constitution is further evidenced by his reference to the Eighth Amendment in the same sentence.  Even more probative, we think, is the concluding sentence of this paragraph.  In it, Wojnar states that he \"also seeks ... damages for the common law torts of false arrest, unlawful imprisonment [and] assault and battery ... under pendent jurisdiction.\"  Significantly absent from this list is a claim for the tort of malpractice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Wojnar next points to a statement by the magistrate judge at voir dire.  In describing the case to the potential jurors, the magistrate judge (who impanelled the jury) stated that it was a \"medical malpractice case.\"  Wojnar argues that this statement indicates the magistrate judge's unswerving belief that the amended complaint stated a claim for negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, counsel for Dr. Bauermeister objected when the magistrate judge made this observation.  After being informed by counsel of his intent to file the motion in limine, the magistrate judge clarified that the case involved \"medical malpractice and/or complete indifference.\"  At most, this shows that the magistrate judge believed that the amended complaint was ambiguous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Finally, Wojnar asserts that Dr. Bauermeister was on notice as early as March 4, 1994 that Wojnar was claiming medical malpractice.  As evidence for this argument, Wojnar points to an interrogatory propounded by Dr. Bauermeister on this date.  In it, Dr. Bauermeister asked that Wojnar specify the \"negligent\" acts committed by Dr. Bauermeister or his agents.  Wojnar also avers that Dr. Bauermeister admitted, in the motion in limine, that he had become apprised of the negligence claim on July 25 (the date Wojnar filed his supplemental answers to Dr. Bauermeister's interrogatories and 10 days after Wojnar filed the motion to amend).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject these arguments.  As Judge Torres stated, the fact that one party propounds interrogatories \"fairly within the ambit of the complaint\" cannot add to the complaint claims not otherwise asserted in it.  We agree with Judge Torres' observation that to so hold would constitute a trap for the thorough.  Further, a party can hardly be said to acquiesce in the assertion of new claims by filing a motion in opposition to them.  This view would render useless motions such as the one filed here, as well as motions to dismiss, and would provide no recourse to parties harmed by the tardy assertion of new claims or defenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, Judge Torres did not abuse his discretion in granting Dr. Bauermeister's motion in limine.  See Knowlton v. Deseret Medical, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558944\"><a href=\"/opinion/558944/prodliabrepcchp-12804-mark-t-knowlton-v-deseret-medical-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></a></span>, 124 (1st Cir. 1991) (standard of review for decision to exclude evidence is abuse of discretion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.  See Local Rule 27.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The second amended complaint set forth allegations of negligence.  However, the denial of the motion to amend is not before us, Wojnar having failed to object within the 10-day time period set forth in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(1)(A).  See United States v. Akinola, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600348\"><a href=\"/opinion/600348/united-states-v-michael-idowu-tunde-akinola/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1105</span></a></span>, 1108-09 (1st Cir. 1993) (where a party does not object to a magistrate judge's order, the court of appeals has no jurisdiction to review it)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
